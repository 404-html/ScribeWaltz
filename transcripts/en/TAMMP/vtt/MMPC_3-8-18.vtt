00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.170
Hey,
what's going on and spill?
Burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:08.760
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast in jazz jacket.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.250
<v 1>Yay.</v>

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.850
<v 0>You.
How is your week going?</v>

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.340
Is it going well?
I am in gloomy,
rainy,
Vancouver,

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.610
British Columbia,
home of the BC lions,

7
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:29.611
the Vancouver Canucks and no fucking Westminster dog show.

8
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.420
Got Unless someplace out here at Westminster.

9
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:34.700
And I learned today that they do have a big dog show up here,

10
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:36.440
but I don't think they are one in the same.

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.640
I can't remember if Westminster takes place in Beverly Hills

12
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.680
or in New York City,

13
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:48.681
but all I know is that you have to be a particular level white person to be

14
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:54.360
invited.
I learned that because I thought I was white enough,

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.340
you know,
and they were like,
oh no,
you are not.

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.040
And uh,
my dream of attending it,
it was over.

17
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.400
Um,
I just think it's funny.
I like dogs.

18
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.920
And then it's just funny when they get them on,
like,
you know,

19
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.330
all shampooed up and that Princeton around,
you know,

20
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.680
and I dunno,

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.400
there's always like that thought of what if the owner false just adds to the

22
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:28.470
tension,
you know?
Um,
anyways,
I'm up here in Vancouver,
I'm having a great time.

23
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.160
Uh,
this past weekend I went to a wedding,

24
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.690
uh,
awesome wedding,
tremendous wedding.

25
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.170
Two people that should be getting married.
They totally had the connection.

26
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.090
Is there anything worse unless you just really into shied Freud?

27
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.150
Um,
when you go to a wedding and you just see two people and you're like,

28
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:50.400
this fucking thing is not going to last the weekend.

29
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.540
I've been to two of those and one of them,

30
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
the marriage lasted two years maybe.

31
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.700
And then the other one,
as far as I know,
they're still together.
Um,

32
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.030
the first weird wedding that I went to,

33
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.763
<v 2>yeah,</v>

34
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.690
<v 0>I think the bride was having second thoughts because the groom was standing up</v>

35
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:12.560
there forever

36
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.620
and then she just showed her walk down the halls,

37
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.930
walked on down the hall,
right.

38
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.140
Walk down the aisle with their dad

39
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.750
and did not have that look that,
you know,

40
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.760
somebody usually has on their wedding day.
Um,

41
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.920
and then when she went up to the altar the whole time they were doing the vows,

42
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.800
she was laughing uncontrollably,
um,
which is,
you know,

43
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.370
sometimes it's just a form of nervousness,
but,
uh,

44
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.140
they didn't even kiss.
And as they walked out,
they went ahead and kiss.
But uh,

45
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.090
as far as I know,
they're still together.
And then another one was,

46
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.953
uh,

47
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.050
someone I was in business with when I first got in to New York City and I went

48
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.400
to this person's wedding and I remember we went out there

49
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.950
and,
uh,
the mother in law,

50
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.760
we got there like what was traffic when we got there right before the wedding

51
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:21.570
was going to start,
it was in the backyard of these rich people's,
uh,
state,
right?

52
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:25.380
This guy married into money and he wasn't rich,
so I think they didn't like him.

53
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.030
So she was,
we pulled up,

54
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:32.031
she was outside walking the dog dressed the way you would walk a dog.

55
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.200
Like she wasn't really even ready.

56
00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:39.201
It was like sort of this nonverbal protest of what was going on in there and uh,

57
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.130
<v 2>okay.</v>

58
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.020
<v 0>That seemed weird.
I was like,
well,
you know,</v>

59
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.410
the inlaws usually never liked the fucking person that daughters daughter's and

60
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:53.390
they never think that these good enough.
Right.
So it didn't really,
you know,

61
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:57.630
it wasn't much of a red flag.
But then I just remembered when,
uh,

62
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.490
the groom afterwards they got married,
he went to uh,

63
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.110
give a toast as to why he loved his wife and it was fucking brutal.

64
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.000
He was like,
uh,
she,
cause she gave some big toast to him.

65
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.710
So then he goes,
okay,
and Dan to you,
my lovely wife,
you,

66
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.870
uh,
you,
you,
you make me laugh.
Uh,

67
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.730
where the background like lighter your life reason you get up in the morning,

68
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.780
like trying to help him out.

69
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.410
It was one of those things where everyone was smiling like this is going to be

70
00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:33.350
great.
And then it just became like everyone just sort of looking down going,

71
00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:35.990
dude,
wrap it up,
wrap it up,
wrap it up.

72
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.970
And that one lasted like two years and it was such a fucked up marriage.

73
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.290
<v 0>I remember him telling me</v>

75
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.320
that they just had this big fight and they were both kind of exhausted

76
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.150
and one of them was just kinda like,
what are we doing?

77
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.520
And the other one who was just like,
yeah,

78
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:59.270
do you like not want to do this anymore?
And the other one was like,

79
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.650
no.
And then the other one was like,
really?
Because I don't either.

80
00:05:03.651 --> 00:05:08.651
And then they started laughing like a bad fucking movie and they had a really

81
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.310
Amy,
a couple divorce.
And I think he was cool.

82
00:05:13.311 --> 00:05:17.540
He didn't try to take any of her fucking money and they just went their separate

83
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:22.400
ways.
They haven't said that this wedding that I went to,

84
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.030
I always have that in the back of my head because as much as I like to do

85
00:05:26.031 --> 00:05:30.110
standup,
I don't literally like to be living in a bit when I'm at a wedding,

86
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.310
you know?
Um,
I don't know.

87
00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:37.340
I just saw him interacting right before the wedding and you know,

88
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.670
it's super stressful if you've ever gotten married and they just seem chill and

89
00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:43.730
relax.
So it was like,
oh good,
good.
Um,

90
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.310
what was funny about this wedding was there was also another ball git Ya at the

91
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:54.230
wedding with a red beard,
like my doppelganger.
And um,

92
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.990
I went there and I had a drink and then I had another drink and then I was just

93
00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:01.240
like,
Eh,
you know,
that's good.
I'm going to stop there.

94
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:04.480
And I started drinking water.
Now on the other hand,

95
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:06.970
the other guy was acting like me last year.

96
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.560
Well before I took four months off of drinking and this fucking guy got fucking

97
00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:16.300
loaded,
right?
So I saw he was kind of swaying in the breeze and I'm like,
Oh,

98
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.250
you know,
Ben there,
I'm not going to judge.
He's having a good time,
whatever.

99
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:25.780
Right?
So the fucking guy.
Next thing I know,
I'm looking outside

100
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.120
and this guy like this wedding was so perfect,

101
00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:36.121
was in this really cool restaurant and slash bar and so up front was the bar and

102
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:41.511
they had these ceiling to floor windows and the evil version of me at some

103
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:47.570
points staggered outside and I just felt everybody looking and they looked any

104
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.810
just fucking puked in the street in front of like a third of the wedding was up

105
00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.130
at the bar,
like a giant puddle of puke.

106
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.230
So all his friends rush outside and that fucking suits to help about and

107
00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:02.550
somebody brought a chair out.

108
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.410
Well they sit the guy down and I'm not laughing at the guy,

109
00:07:07.411 --> 00:07:10.440
I'm just laughing because I've been there.
I mean that in a fucking,

110
00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:13.440
not having to all wedding that I was just at looking at me,
but you know,

111
00:07:13.441 --> 00:07:14.670
we've all had our moments.

112
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.960
I remember one time I was somewhere down the Cape Fucking Cape Cod Jode best

113
00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:23.040
fucking potato chips.

114
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.630
<v 0>I somehow passed out on a bluff that was headed down towards the ocean.</v>

116
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.940
<v 0>I was just like the middle of the day</v>

118
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.820
and uh,
I forget where my buddy was.
He was the one driving,

119
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.050
he was somewhere somewhere else.
I came home,

120
00:07:46.051 --> 00:07:50.960
something happened with the car,
um,
and we were just passed out.

121
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:55.550
I'm like,
the fucking this,
it was a bluff fight.
I just like saying that word.

122
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:56.750
I've never used it properly.

123
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.970
And all of a sudden I was laying there and the son felt good and everything I

124
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:04.610
was passed out and like it felt like a day later,

125
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.590
all of a sudden I just here and out there,
that is where the Nina,

126
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.710
the Pinta and it picked up in the Santa Maria came in back in 14 fucking blah

127
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:18.650
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And then I had this little kid's voice go,
Mommy,

128
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:20.420
why is that guy sleeping there?

129
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.620
And there was like some sort of fucking tour going on

130
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.700
and a,

131
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.700
I vaguely remember changing a tire and I didn't put the Jack Underneath the

132
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:35.150
frame and it went to like rush through the floorboard.

133
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.940
So there you go.
All right.
I'm not judging this guy,

134
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:45.770
but it was funny as fucking hell.
So this fucking guy fucking just,

135
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:48.710
you know,
Great Lakes Yak,
you know,

136
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.660
puke all over the streets or somebody brings a chair out and they sit them down

137
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.760
and he's sitting there hanging his head.
Like,
you know,

138
00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:59.910
Jordan was sitting when he had the flu and they put the towel over his head.

139
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:02.370
He was sitting like that minus the towel over his head.

140
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.730
So then they start calling like an Uber or Lyft and these cars keep pulling up

141
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.670
and they pull up to this bald dude with the red beard sitting with his head

142
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:16.800
hanging down in a giant puddle of puke.

143
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:18.690
And everybody would just pull out and be like,
yeah,
it's fucking,

144
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:22.500
guy's not getting my car.
They would drive away.
And,
uh,

145
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.430
it just became this thing like,
dude,
you gotta move up down the street.

146
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.110
You got to get them away from the puke.
And Anyway,

147
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.480
somebody finally came along and took them home.
But,
uh,

148
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.230
he was definitely the highlight of the evening.
So,
uh,
I want to,

149
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:39.420
I don't know who that guy was,
but I want to thank him for the,
uh,

150
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:43.740
the free entertainment.
So anyways,
let's get back on track here.

151
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:46.350
I'm up here in our Vancouver and uh,
as I mentioned before,

152
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:47.330
I don't know if I mentioned,
uh,

153
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.450
I was talking to a number of people up here that listen to this podcast to fly

154
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:55.210
helicopters and one of them had access to the,
uh,

155
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.210
Cabri g two.
I hope I'm saying that right cabaret or is it [inaudible]?

156
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.900
I think it's Cabri g two,

157
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.850
which is basically like the Robinson r 22 that I fly.
But it has,

158
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.550
you know,
any safety issues that the Robinson may or may not have,
you know,

159
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.650
that it does have,

160
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.700
I'm just not trying to shit on it because I fly it all the time and I do like

161
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:21.210
that helicopter.
These people took it to the next level.

162
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.470
It's like the next iPhone,
except it didn't try to like,
you know,

163
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.940
capture your fucking face.
Um,
it was new and improved,

164
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.020
so I wanted to try this thing out and um,
these people had access to it.

165
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.590
So I was going to rent a car today and his drive about an hour outside of

166
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:41.250
Vancouver.
Um,
but then I got a text from the guy who was going to fly with said,

167
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:45.090
hey,
there's a guy here,
he's a big fan of yours.
He's got a fucking the,

168
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.450
he's got a 66,
I'll pick you up right at the heliport downtown.
I was like,

169
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.080
fuck it,
let's do it.
So I show up,
this dude named Chris,
I want to thank him.

170
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:56.790
Great guy picked me up a me all the way out there and I was telling him,
he goes,

171
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.540
so how did you get into wanting to fly?
Uh,
the Cabri g two?
And I was like,
well,

172
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:04.890
you know,
I read all about,
you know,
the low,
Geez,
you know,

173
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:07.950
situations,
the mass bumping.
I got a little freaked out.

174
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.930
Vietnam helicopter pilots.

175
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.890
I just kind of feel like it's a bit of a safety issue and they just sort of

176
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:16.920
taught pilots how to fly out of it rather than fix it.

177
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.430
But what the fuck do I know?
I only have 160 hours.
Right.

178
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.170
But that was just my gut feeling.

179
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.510
So I want to check this thing out to see what the deals with this thing.

180
00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:30.511
So we land at the airport and as we land one of those Cabri g tubes is coming in

181
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:35.310
and I immediately loved it.
I loved the shape of it.
And when it landed,

182
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:40.080
seeing this little two seater with the fully articulated main rotor system was

183
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:44.820
like,
I mean that's,
that's been the dream.
Um,
you know,

184
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:48.050
cause with the art 22 you got to lead with the collective with,

185
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:52.530
with those things,
you can just push the stick forward,
which,
uh,
it's still,

186
00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:56.340
whenever I,
something like that,
when the guy just goes,
okay,
knows it forward,

187
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.970
I always have to make the joke that,
you know,
I usually don't hear that,
you know,

188
00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:02.640
flying a Robinson.
So anyways,
um,

189
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.370
<v 3>okay.</v>

190
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.260
<v 0>The thing lands and as it lands,</v>

191
00:12:06.261 --> 00:12:10.720
I see this guy getting out who looks just like the dude that I saw on the

192
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:14.110
youtube video and I was like that the guy who uploaded the video that did the

193
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:14.944
whole,

194
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.680
<v 3>okay,</v>

195
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.060
<v 0>the whole thing from nose to tail review of it,
he goes,
yeah,
that's him.</v>

196
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.840
And it was so surreal because I didn't know I was going to meet this guy.

197
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.590
It was like literally the guy that was the reason that I wanted to fly it.

198
00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:31.280
I ended up not only going to his place,
I ended up getting a fly with them.
Uh,

199
00:12:31.281 --> 00:12:36.200
it's BC helicopters and the guy's name is Misha Gilb and he was incredible

200
00:12:36.201 --> 00:12:38.660
pilot.
He did an auto rotation at the end.

201
00:12:38.661 --> 00:12:42.670
That was just was unreal for those of you who fly Robinson's,

202
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:47.120
there's no watching your rpms going too high,
too low.

203
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.330
It's just teach us,
put the collective down and steer it.

204
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.160
And he landed this thing like,
like,
like a fucking daisy.

205
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.670
It was incredible.
And um,
so anyways,
he,

206
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.780
he was filming the entire time that we were flying and um,

207
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.090
I was flying horribly.
I could barely even,

208
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.520
I couldn't even hold the hover in the thing because the main road,

209
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:10.580
it turned the exact opposite way.
And as much as I told myself,

210
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.070
ignore your muscle memory,
just,
you know,
correct.
Whichever way the nose is going.

211
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.960
And it was also super sensitive.
It felt like the sports suspension on a car,

212
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.070
like a sports car,
you know?

213
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.743
<v 3>MMM.</v>

214
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.730
<v 0>Where it was so hypersensitive that I just kept over correcting.
And then it was,</v>

215
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.700
it took me back to when I had like under 10 hours

216
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.370
flying and was just the first time trying to hold the hover.
But,
uh,
of course,

217
00:13:37.371 --> 00:13:40.490
by the end I got way better than where I was at,

218
00:13:40.491 --> 00:13:42.830
but by then his GoPro had ran out.

219
00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:47.330
So you can guys can have a fun time laughing at me flying this thing like a

220
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:51.620
fucking salmon going up seats upstream.
It was pretty bad in the beginning,
but,

221
00:13:51.621 --> 00:13:54.620
um,
I really,
really loved it and I got to fly,

222
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.670
you know,
I mean,
it was definitely a cloudy day and everything,

223
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:01.730
but I thought it was kind of cool that it was raining out and all that just to

224
00:14:01.731 --> 00:14:04.310
flying something different and,
um,

225
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.400
got to go all along the,
uh,

226
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.850
the whole skyline of Vancouver,

227
00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:14.270
all the way up to where all these rich people live and shit.
And then,
uh,

228
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.240
we flew back and on the way back we flew up this river bed,

229
00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:20.440
which I hope he keeps that footage.
That's one of the coolest things I ever did.

230
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.223
<v 3>MMM.</v>

231
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.320
<v 0>I felt like I was on the discovery channel.</v>

232
00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:28.570
Like I should have been chasing a bunch of gazelles or something or watching

233
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.000
hippos,
you know,
fighting alligators.
There's something out on the Serengeti.

234
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:37.410
It was amazing.
And,
um,
we ended up landing off airport up there.

235
00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:39.780
We landed off airport and,
uh,

236
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.670
just some farmer's yard.
And that's when I was just like,

237
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.890
I had it.
The thing was all over the place when I was flying.
Um,

238
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.990
but anyways,
I just want to thank everybody at BC helicopters.

239
00:14:52.991 --> 00:14:57.550
I S I had such a great time and I will definitely be back and a,

240
00:14:57.551 --> 00:14:58.600
for those of you who do fly,

241
00:14:58.601 --> 00:15:01.260
so you get a chance to check out one of those calves,
Eg to sip,

242
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.980
pretty fucking amazing.
Um,
and uh,

243
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.471
and that's it.

244
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:11.140
And then I got two more shows tonight at the Queen Elizabeth Theater here.
And,

245
00:15:11.141 --> 00:15:11.974
um,

246
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.220
and then I immediately go back to go hang with the family because that's the new

247
00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:16.030
me,
right?

248
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.140
I fly in the day of the Gig and then I do the Gig the next day and then I

249
00:15:20.141 --> 00:15:24.280
immediately leave because I got my,
you know,

250
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.420
my lovely wife and my daughter.
I gotta go,
I gotta get home too.

251
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:33.280
So if I only leave for like two days,
I don't have that much guilt.
Well,

252
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:37.720
you feel like an absentee absentee father,
you know.
Um,

253
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.820
so anyways,
um,
what time do we got here?
Yes.

254
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.960
15 minutes.
And I should probably do this.
Read here.
Okay.
Me undies,
everybody.

255
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.220
All right.

256
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.480
You heard me talk about me on these and you know that I am a big believer in

257
00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:53.314

260
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.170

that was a term for titties.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.040
Um,

279

I don't know if you were paying attention,

280
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:32.210
but two people that won an Oscar on Monday.

281
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.240
Also do a voice on the wonderful cartoon after Easter family,

Allison Janney who did the voice of Ah,

283
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.740
Mrs Plaster where uh,
she won an Oscar for the Tonya Harding movie.

284
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:50.741
And then Sam Rockwell who does the voice of a Frank's nemesis,

285
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:51.501
even though he does,

286
00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:55.100
he's not even aware that he's this number assist Vic Reynolds one for three

287
00:17:55.101 --> 00:17:58.550
billboards.
Um,
so that's pretty cool.
You know,

288
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.440
I think that upped the ante of our show.
The status anyways

289
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.780
too.
I know,
I'm throwing that in.
Who Does your show?

290
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.630
Who Do you do with your show was Oh,
two Oscar winners.

291
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.920
Allison Janney and Sam Rockwell.
Right.
Laura dern,

292
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.130
Justin Long.
Dave Kepner.
I'm and I can go on forever.
Um,

293
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.730
by the way,
I'm really loving the,
I don't want to jinx it,
but this season three,

294
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.760
I know I'm teasing it early,
but uh,

295
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.060
we've been laughing our asses off in the,
uh,
the edit room.

296
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.420
But I got to tell you yesterday I came in,

297
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:41.470
landed and I was really tired because I did a show the night before to a four

298
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.050
show us show down at the Improv.
And

299
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.140
I had a beer or two after at the end of the,
um,

300
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.380
at the end of the show and he didn't get home til like,
you know,

301
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.080
one in the morning or something like that.
And then my daughter,

302
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.520
my daughter gets up at like quarter to six,
six o'clock.
It's hilarious.

303
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.983
<v 3>You know,</v>

304
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.700
<v 0>just come downstairs.
He can't,
you know,
isn't that this point?</v>

305
00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:07.400
Like the reason why I drink so little now is now I don't know what happened.

306
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.300
Like if I have like,
like one beer or two beers,
like the next day,

307
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.623
<v 3>you know,</v>

308
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.780
<v 0>my daughter wakes me up and it's just like,
I feel it's some</v>

309
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.160
waking up just not like a hung over but just feeling like less energized

310
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.231
and you know,

311
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:29.250
she's talking all this jibberish out there and I just opened the door and the

312
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:31.590
second I opened the door she just goes,
hi.

313
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.240
I don't know if I told you,
it's like high is her word for everything.

314
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.130
High means high.
High means I want that.
Or if she wants attention,

315
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:47.790
she does like this frantic like hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Like,

316
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:52.050
if she sees two people talking and she wants to be is to really like her being

317
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:55.440
like,
hey,
hey,
hey,
hey,
little help over here.
Um,

318
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:59.920
I want to get out of this fucking chair.
So,
um,
anyway,

319
00:19:59.921 --> 00:20:02.670
so I didn't get a lot of sleep and then I had to go to the airport and then I

320
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:06.300
flew up and whenever you flying the plane this way,
so he's like,

321
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.560
everybody wants to sleep except for that one person who has the window open and

322
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:15.330
then I can't fall asleep.
So I get to the hotel and I'm like,
all right,

323
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.420
now I'm just going to lay down here for like a half an hour.

324
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.200
And I had south park on speaking of,
you know,

325
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.180
animated shows,
just total next level.
Absolutely fucking hilarious.

326
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.020
And I was watching this episode where Cartman had stolen a bunch of votes

327
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.390
and uh,

328
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.500
I fell asleep and I woke up a little later and I open my eyes and South Park was

329
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:43.260
still on.
I didn't realize that they had a marathon going on,

330
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:46.080
like they did like three or four episodes in a row.
A long story short,

331
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:52.250
my pickup for the seven o'clock show is it's six 20 and I am asleep and all of a

332
00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:57.870
sudden the phone rings super loud in my room and I open my eyes and it's pitch

333
00:20:57.871 --> 00:20:59.550
black in the room.
And I was like,
Oh fuck.

334
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.800
And I was trying to find my way out and I couldn't,

335
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:06.730
I literally opened the door that went into a closet and then verse he called me

336
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:08.230
and I saw it.
It was six 30.

337
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:09.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

338
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:13.520
<v 0>And,
uh,
I literally just threw my clothes on,</v>

339
00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.530
didn't even iron my shirt,
got to the venue,

340
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.040
sipped a little stroke OT and went out on stage.
Had a great set though,

341
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:25.140
but I was like really?
A,
it was weird.
I was like,

342
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.083
<v 2>okay,</v>

343
00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.450
<v 0>I wasn't tired cause I slept for like three hours.
So I felt refreshed.</v>

344
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.710
But I also felt like I just woke up.
So,
um,

345
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.690
I dunno if the first 10 minutes the show felt like an outer body experience,
but,

346
00:21:40.691 --> 00:21:43.260
uh,
I've never slept like,

347
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.830
like that close up until like almost like missing a show or something like that.

348
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:52.600
But,
uh,
fortunately,
uh,
you know,
went well.
I don't know that kind of went nowhere.

349
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.540
You know,
I almost missed my show but I didn't.

350
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:59.380
And then the show went well like did I really need to fucking tell you all of

351
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:02.950
that?
Was there a reason for that?
I apologize that this recording sucks.

352
00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:07.240
I bought at an external mic for my iPhone that uh,

353
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:12.020
Kevin Shea,
the hilarious Kevin Shay came on my show.
That's right.

354
00:22:12.021 --> 00:22:13.960
It came on the Monday morning podcast,

355
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.100
promoted his special and told me all about this.
Mike going,

356
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.370
I love this fucking microphone.

357
00:22:18.371 --> 00:22:21.940
I'm gonna have to talk to him about it cause I ordered it off the Internet
there,

358
00:22:21.941 --> 00:22:25.870
the inner web and uh,
it was only 20 bucks.
I'm like,

359
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.900
how the fuck is a microphone that only costs $20 going to be good?

360
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.550
And guess what?
It isn't.
It fucking sucks.
So I must be using it wrong.

361
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.420
Cause Kevin Shay's is smart guy so he's got to teach me how to use the fucking

362
00:22:37.421 --> 00:22:37.601
thing.

363
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:40.690
Cause it sounds worse than if I just hold the phone up like I am right now,

364
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.400
if that makes any sense.

365
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

366
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.210
<v 0>But anyways,
I,
oh my God,</v>

367
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.770
I have to tell you this fucking stupid tee shirt that I saw there.

368
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.200
There's like some corporation up here,
you know,
selling clothes.
One of those,

369
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.370
one of those fucking closed the place and on the mannequins they have all this

370
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.220
fucking political tee shirts about equal pay for women.
And it says like,

371
00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:06.720
enough is enough and something about a quality and all that.
And it's just like,

372
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.920
I just can't like
these fucking assholes.

373
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:15.740
It's like you were,
the guy's not fucking paying people.
Like,

374
00:23:15.741 --> 00:23:19.430
why am I getting a fucking leg?
My voice cracking it.
What the fuck are you?

375
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

376
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.390
<v 0>How do you get off selling those fucking shirts?</v>

377
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

378
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.640
<v 0>I don't understand why these feminist groups don't go in there and be like,
okay,</v>

379
00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:33.020
you're selling enough is enough.
T shirts,
uh,
why you sell it?
Well,

380
00:23:33.021 --> 00:23:37.910
let's look into your fucking history of,
of paying people that's like this new,

381
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.510
this new fucking thing.
What it is,
it's not a new thing.

382
00:23:41.511 --> 00:23:46.511
This is what people always do when a movement happens and they get freaked out

383
00:23:46.561 --> 00:23:51.330
by what they eventually do is they join it and once they join it they have like

384
00:23:51.331 --> 00:23:54.690
a level of control or they could just act like they fucking agree with it.

385
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.830
So then like you don't,
nobody's looking at you like you're a problem.

386
00:23:58.831 --> 00:24:02.580
You basically you just cut,
sort of send it down the line like no problem.

387
00:24:02.581 --> 00:24:06.750
Here look we have uh,
enough is enough t shirts.

388
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.520
Um,
I actually have an uh,
an enough is enough thing,

389
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.650
uh,
enough is enough as far as just going after what guys do to women.

390
00:24:16.651 --> 00:24:18.480
How about we balanced it out,
you know,

391
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.000
and some on all this shit that fucker women do to guys,
you know.
Ah,

392
00:24:24.001 --> 00:24:26.940
that'll never happen.
Ah,
you can't do that.

393
00:24:26.941 --> 00:24:30.710
If you do that then you're a fucking sexist.
We're going to six,

394
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.460
the male female dynamic by only examining the behavior of men

395
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.950
because the ladies are perfect.

396
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.430
I would love to know what sweatshop makes those enough is enough.
T shirts,

397
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.370
what do fuck is Michael Moore lately?
Well,
actually,

398
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:53.060
it's a tee shirt sold here in Canada and God knows he blows everybody north of

399
00:24:53.061 --> 00:24:55.910
fucking Minnesota.
He just thinks that,
you know,

400
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.770
like be like Canada can do no wrong,

401
00:24:57.771 --> 00:25:01.460
despite the fact it's one of the most overtly racist places I've ever been to,

402
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.670
um,
the entire country.
You know what I mean?

403
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:08.150
But od you gotta do is put on a silly hat and take some syrup out of a fucking

404
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:11.540
tree.
And then Michael Morris just like,
oh my God,
these people are amazing.

405
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.340
Um,
oh,
well why would you do that?
Why,
why,

406
00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:21.180
why would you have such a nice friendly podcast and then,

407
00:25:21.181 --> 00:25:25.590
you know,
just have to pick on and,
you know,
punch up bill,
why can't you punch up?

408
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.680
So what I've learned here about Vancouver,
um,
other than it's,

409
00:25:28.681 --> 00:25:30.090
it's beautiful and that they like,

410
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.780
they like buildings that look like the buildings that Godzilla steps on.

411
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:38.700
I've noticed that
there's a lot of,
a lot of money from China here.

412
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.730
You know,
I dunno what the fuck happened in China,

413
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:46.350
but some sort of crackdown happened and there was a bunch of rich Chinese people

414
00:25:46.351 --> 00:25:49.920
where they were just like,
oh fuck,
we got to get our money out of this country.

415
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.780
And they started buying up property along sunset strip bunch of places in the

416
00:25:54.781 --> 00:25:58.080
United States and evidently here in Vancouver and I gotta,

417
00:25:58.081 --> 00:25:59.850
I gotta commend

418
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.063
<v 3>mmm.</v>

419
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.230
<v 0>Chinese people with money.
Those people know where to fucking buy.
You know,</v>

420
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:12.240
although I think Vancouver is smarter than La with the global warming,

421
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.840
without,
you know,
it's lush land up here with all the water,
you know,

422
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.300
lakes and everything.
It's absolutely beautiful.

423
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.210
<v 3>Um,
I dunno,</v>

424
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.640
<v 0>that must be incredible to leave China and come to Vancouver.</v>

425
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:29.450
We can actually have space,
but then it'd be weird because you'd miss,
you know,

426
00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:30.620
you'd miss your country.
Right.

427
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.323
<v 3>But,
uh,</v>

428
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:33.351
<v 0>I don't know,</v>

429
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:37.730
just having been over there how crowded it is and how dirty the air is,

430
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.740
it's got to be fucking incredible because I think it's incredible.

431
00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:44.190
It just coming up from La,
you know?
Um,

432
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.220
and there was like a million people.
All these people coming out here login,

433
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:54.330
that Goddamn skis skiing is fucking incredible.

434
00:26:54.331 --> 00:26:58.260
But I got to tell you literally have to be like your own Roadie,
you know?

435
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.770
And there was all these people like,
you know,
you gotta go snowboard man,

436
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:03.450
you can just have that like a backpack.

437
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.930
Just throw it over your fucking shoulders.
Right.

438
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.960
It seems to be like,
I was just sort of analyzing it.

439
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:12.840
Like skiing scares the shit out of me because it's like every year,

440
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:16.950
some fucking guy around my age cheesily people my age,

441
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.430
you know,
late forties,
early fifties.

442
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:24.360
And they just come down a trail and they hit a tree and then then it's just

443
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:27.180
fucking it.
But the last time I skied,

444
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:32.181
I was in Utah and a doing a gig out there and the comedian I was working with

445
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:33.900
wanted to go skiing.
So we went,

446
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:39.090
I fucking dislocated my thumb and like nine times I thought it was going to blow

447
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:43.560
out my niece and I vowed I would never go again.
And if I did,

448
00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.670
I would go snowboarding.

449
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.580
I would much rather deal with a broken tailbone or fucked up risks than a blown

450
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:55.020
out knee.
Um,
you know,
in my,

451
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:59.080
it's my advanced age.
Um,
so anyways,

452
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.830
I am going to go over to the venue right now because,
uh,
they allegedly,

453
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:06.900
they got a drum kit backstage at that place.

454
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:10.260
So I think I'm gonna go over there and go jam man on some fucking tunes.
Good,

455
00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:14.670
clean fun.
And then I'm going to do my two shows and listen to this.

456
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:15.391
I come home,

457
00:28:15.391 --> 00:28:20.391
I go to bed and then I have to get up at four in the morning because I have to

458
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:22.050
call.
Uh,

459
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.820
I got a call back east cause I got a big show coming up in Boston and I got to

460
00:28:26.821 --> 00:28:30.630
sell a bunch of tickets.
So,
and they want me to come on the radio live.

461
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.360
And uh,
so that's going to be my day.

462
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:35.130
Something to wake up at four in the fucking morning,

463
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.580
do that shit and then go to the God damn airport and then come home.

464
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.070
And my daughter's going to be like fucking bouncing off the walls ready to play.

465
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.030
But you know what,
it's going to be great.
You know what's cool is she,
uh,

466
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.910
we have this door to our house where it's got like,
you know,

467
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:53.520
you got the door and then along both sides it has like these,

468
00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.610
those old fashioned like little windows that go from the top all the way down to

469
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:58.770
the bottom.
So,
uh,

470
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.860
it's the greatest thing ever when you'd come home cause she's looking through

471
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:05.340
smiling at you.
But it's still worse when you leave.
You know,

472
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:07.250
cause she has like the saddest look on her face.

473
00:29:07.251 --> 00:29:11.880
Cause now she actually understands when you're leaving.
So,
um,

474
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.300
and I got a feeling it's only gonna get worse.

475
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.960
I just don't want to get to the point where it's like I'm never want to be the

476
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:22.980
point where I leave so much that it's no big deal.
You know,

477
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.980
like I remember long time ago,
Danny Gans,

478
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:30.981
the late Danny Gans told a story of how we ended up in Vegas is this kid drew a

479
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.870
family portrait and it was the mother.
And all the kids.
And then he goes,
oh,

480
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:38.160
that's great.
Where's Daddy?

481
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:42.740
And then she pointed and she had drawn an airplane and was on the plane flying

482
00:29:42.741 --> 00:29:45.930
away.
It was like,
oh,
fuck.
Um,

483
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.570
but what am I going to do?
This is what the fuck I do for a living.
Uh,

484
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:54.560
we also announced some dates over,
uh,
two dates,
um,

485
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.270
one in Dublin and one in London.
And I know I got some shit from people.

486
00:29:59.271 --> 00:30:00.800
Why don't you come here?
Why don't you come there?

487
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.030
I'm going to do more of an extensive tour through Europe.
Uh,

488
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.530
at some point I just have to figure out.

489
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.810
I got a balanced my new life here with the wife and kid.
Um,

490
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.420
but I definitely want to get to places that had been before and places that I've

491
00:30:14.421 --> 00:30:18.680
never been a,
I just have to figure out how to do it.
But when I go to,
um,

492
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:22.690
that Dublin in London Gig,
that's,

493
00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.990
that's the week of my 50th birthday.
So I'm doing Dublin,

494
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.370
uh,
first and then I'm doing Royal Albert Hall,

495
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.840
which is insane.
Then I'm going to be there.
I can't believe it.

496
00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.160
And that's going to be for my 50th birthday.
And uh,

497
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.710
then I'm taking a week off and I ain't going with,
you know,

498
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.930
my wife and kid and everything.

499
00:30:44.931 --> 00:30:49.250
And that's how I'm going to celebrate turning 50 man.
What the fuck?
So

500
00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.970
I don't know.
Most,
a lot of my friends didn't make it this far,

501
00:30:52.971 --> 00:30:55.970
so I'm not going to bitch about it,
but uh,
it's a big number.
Okay.
Hey,

502
00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:58.190
it's a rough one.
I right.
All right,
well that's the podcast.

503
00:30:58.191 --> 00:31:00.650
Thank you guys for listening.
Thank you everybody up here in Vancouver,

504
00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.760
they came out to the show last night and are coming tonight.
Uh,

505
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.950
amazing crowds last night and I think it's going to be more the same tonight.

506
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.090
Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you on that.

507
00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.193
<v 4>Okay.</v>

508
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.640
<v 5>Hey,
what's up everybody?</v>

509
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:11.260
It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
March the eighth,

510
00:32:11.261 --> 00:32:14.020
2010.
Oh my God.

511
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:16.480
Could you believe the Oscars last night?

512
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:21.510
I can't believe that Kelly Wiggin Twat and phase didn't get best supporting

513
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:24.340
current for a,

514
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:28.180
let's make a fucking Afghan in the 18 hundreds.

515
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:31.511
Do you know,

516
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:34.570
I'm actually still in San Jose right now and I was supposed to have a show

517
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:36.460
tonight.
I'm actually recording this on Sunday.

518
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:38.740
I was supposed to have a show tonight,
but it got,

519
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.750
because everybody evidently is watching the fucking Oscars now.

520
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.930
I can understand if you're a abroad and you want to watch that shit,
I get it.

521
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.340
That's like your super bowl.

522
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.960
We get to sit there and watch the different dresses in which couple is with

523
00:32:54.961 --> 00:32:59.961
which couple and who just broke up and are they there with their new boyfriend

524
00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:02.010
or girlfriend and oh my God.

525
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.880
Did they ignore each other on the red carpet and look at some fucking twats

526
00:33:05.881 --> 00:33:09.510
yanked back face as she talks about their shoes.
I get that.

527
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.810
But where the fuck with a men in San Jose who I,

528
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:16.110
we had the enough fucking balls left in their relationship to be like,

529
00:33:16.111 --> 00:33:20.430
you know what?
I'm not going to your stupid fucking Oscar party.
Okay.

530
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.210
Cause I don't want to listen to fucking 98 different reads of,
Oh my God,

531
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.580
you know,
I'm like,
God,
why is she wearing that jazz?
Oh my God,

532
00:33:29.581 --> 00:33:32.880
she looks so beautiful.
Oh my God.

533
00:33:32.881 --> 00:33:37.120
That was like the best speech Aba.
Huh?

534
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.660
Is that what you did?
He's sitting in a cubicle right now as a man.

535
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.890
Is that what you did last night?

536
00:33:40.891 --> 00:33:44.280
Cause if he did he should be hanging in your fucking head.
Huh?

537
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.720
What happened?
Let's go down memory lane.
Okay,

538
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.020
go all the way back to high school when you still let us set up balls between

539
00:33:52.021 --> 00:33:55.230
your fucking legs.
Remember that they were brand new and they were ready to go.

540
00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:58.740
I got a question for you.
Where the fuck did they go?
Cause you definitely,

541
00:33:58.741 --> 00:33:59.940
you definitely didn't have them.

542
00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:04.890
Men of San Jose because you weren't in my fucking show last night to the point

543
00:34:04.891 --> 00:34:08.640
it had to be canceled.
Granted,
I'm not going to lie.

544
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.180
About a fucking month and a half ago,
a married couple came out of a bar,

545
00:34:12.181 --> 00:34:13.320
got into with a bouncer.

546
00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:17.280
A cop showed up and he fucking tased the dude's wife and shot the guy in the

547
00:34:17.281 --> 00:34:20.880
abdomen and the dude damn near bled out right in front of the Improv here.

548
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.410
Look it up online.
They got the picture,
you know,
after this shooting,

549
00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:27.960
they clean up the mess.
There's always the fucking,
uh,

550
00:34:27.961 --> 00:34:32.961
old ketchup stains on the sidewalk and a couple of articles of clothing and it's

551
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.100
fucking hilarious.
And then right,

552
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.210
right next to it they had the marquee and it still said Eddie Griffin.

553
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.750
It was funny.
So yeah,
I guess that isn't good for fucking business.
But,
um,

554
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:50.681
I got to tell you,
man,

555
00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:55.360
I had a great time coming up here and I've avoided coming to San Jose because I

556
00:34:55.361 --> 00:34:57.880
was worried that a basic,
what happened Sunday night.

557
00:34:57.881 --> 00:35:01.090
I thought it was going to happen all week because I don't know what is about

558
00:35:01.091 --> 00:35:04.960
California.
I just feel like if you're not,
if you're not a fucking Latino comic,

559
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.290
you know,
I just don't [inaudible] super famous.

560
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.560
You're not going to sell any tickets out here.
Cause you know,

561
00:35:11.561 --> 00:35:15.370
some people put that in my head.
Um,
but no,

562
00:35:15.371 --> 00:35:18.850
a lot of people came out on a Saturday night and they actually had a balcony.

563
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:24.180
That was the thing about on Friday,
nobody showed up.
Right.
So they are amp.

564
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:29.050
I'm standing in this huge fucking theater in the entire upper deck is empty.

565
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.780
I felt like I was performing at a fucking royals game.
You know,

566
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.020
I felt like I should've been like singing the national anthem or something like

567
00:35:35.021 --> 00:35:38.910
that,
and then yelling at my manager wondering what happened to my fucking music

568
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:43.330
career that I couldn't at least sing it like an angel's game.
Well,

569
00:35:43.331 --> 00:35:45.210
those fucking idiots got to come out there with that.

570
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:47.460
They have there that goddamn noise makers.

571
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.170
How Leymah you his fans that the ownership is basically saying,
you know what?

572
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.580
You guys have such a lack of passion.
We need to,
we need to,

573
00:35:56.581 --> 00:36:00.990
to invent something to make it sound like you guys care way more than you really

574
00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:02.160
do here.

575
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:06.330
Here's a couple of inflatable fucking plastic balloons.

576
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.830
Just slam them together.

577
00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:11.760
We'll even get a monkey will have a crazy monkey out there.

578
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.010
Fucking angels.
Um,
anyways,

579
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:21.060
what am I doing here?
What the fuck am I talking about?
I actually,

580
00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.490
I had a great weekend and uh,
believe it or not,

581
00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:24.450
you wouldn't know it from my voice.

582
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:28.560
And I found a great Sushi place out here at checkout.
Smile,
Sushi,
Sushi.

583
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.110
If you get a chance to,
I don't know where the fuck it is,

584
00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:33.810
but you have the Internet,
right?
They gave me,

585
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:36.270
I'm fucking walking around right now.
I'm looking out the window.

586
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:40.260
They got a museum across the street and they have a star trek exhibition and you

587
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:44.670
should have seen these fucking nerds.
You should have seen these fucking nerds.

588
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.640
Just,
just,
just standing outside,

589
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:52.290
like waiting for a museum to open.
That's when you know you're a fucking nerd.

590
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.300
Okay?
Everybody's gone to museum.

591
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.310
But who the fuck has ever stood outside of museum with your face pressed against

592
00:36:59.311 --> 00:37:02.730
the glass,
waiting for the fucking thing to open up.

593
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.730
You know,
Jesus Christ.
I mean,
I,
I see back in the day,
you're what?

594
00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:12.570
You're waiting for fucking concert tickets.
You know what I mean?

595
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.440
Back in the day when they used to have like actually have record stores and the

596
00:37:16.441 --> 00:37:20.580
artists would come through and you'd be standing outside strawberries records

597
00:37:20.581 --> 00:37:25.350
and tapes,
you know,
waiting to have your cassette signed by Brian Adams.

598
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.220
What did I pick?
Bryan Adams.
I'll tell you why,

599
00:37:29.221 --> 00:37:33.810
because I'm staying at a very nice hotel as I've made it to that level in this

600
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:37.290
business.
All right.
I am on the 14th floor,

601
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.860
the Penthouse fucking level,
although I just have a suite.

602
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.920
I haven't got to that level yet and I'm looking out the barren fucking landscape

603
00:37:46.411 --> 00:37:49.590
here as far as people go.
Anyways.
Um,

604
00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:52.261
but anyways,

605
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:56.010
I went down to the fucking place to have breakfast in the second I walked in.

606
00:37:56.011 --> 00:38:00.330
Right?
All I see is,
is his cloth napkins in leather bound menus.

607
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.810
So right there,
you know,
it's going to be like 58 bucks for an Omelette.

608
00:38:03.811 --> 00:38:08.610
So all I want to do is stop and turn around and get the fuck out of the place.

609
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.070
But do I,
of course I don't.
You know why?

610
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:14.820
Because there's so few people in there that everybody looked at me when I came

611
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:18.210
in and it reminded me of this time when I went to this titty bar in Troy,

612
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:21.600
New York,
I believe it was Troy,
New York.
It was called the cloud night.

613
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.000
And he perverts out there.
You know what the fuck I'm talking about?

614
00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:28.230
It's not really,
it's,
it's sort of a strip club,
sort of a guy's house.

615
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.300
I would have to describe it as,

616
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:33.180
I just remember there was an upstairs when he came walking in that literally

617
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:37.250
look like some old lady should came down in her house coat and just been like,

618
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.120
all right Kenya,
Kenya,
stop all the strapping.
I'm trying to sleep.
Um,

619
00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.180
and then some sort of double wide trailer that's sold videos that was attached

620
00:38:47.181 --> 00:38:49.280
to the other side of it.
But anyways,
long story short,

621
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.490
I want to know what to other people who will remain nameless cause I don't name

622
00:38:52.491 --> 00:38:56.190
names and the fucking podcast because I'm old school.
Um,

623
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.700
I can't even fucking remember who they are anyways.

624
00:38:58.701 --> 00:39:01.430
I've talked to my cell phone so fucking much.
So anyways,

625
00:39:01.431 --> 00:39:04.760
I walk into the God damn place.
We all walk in and the second we walk in,

626
00:39:04.761 --> 00:39:06.470
all we want to do is turn around and walk out.

627
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:10.700
But there's so few fucking people in there.
Everybody's looking at us,
the dancer,

628
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.880
the fucking Dj,
the fucking,
uh,

629
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:17.400
porky guy who runs the God damn place.
And the two fucking,
uh,

630
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.690
immigrant truckers who was sitting in there,
I believe they were Yugoslavian.

631
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.710
I can't remember what,
see,
you know,
he just fucking go in and sit down.

632
00:39:24.711 --> 00:39:28.010
So I went in and I sat down at this fucking breakfast place and back to the

633
00:39:28.011 --> 00:39:30.380
breakfast place.
All right.
Try to keep up.

634
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.890
I'm playing these fucking brain games on the Internet.
Her right?

635
00:39:33.891 --> 00:39:38.600
My fucking brain is sharp.
It's coming back.
Um,
God,

636
00:39:38.601 --> 00:39:41.000
I'm lonely anyways.
Um,

637
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:45.170
so I sit down at his fucking breakfast place and uh,

638
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.520
there's just a medium sized woman who suffers from vocal fry.

639
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.640
And for those of you didn't major in communications and didn't have to take a

640
00:39:52.641 --> 00:39:53.810
career speech class.

641
00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:58.430
Vocal fry is basically a way of speaking where you're not,

642
00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.540
you're not forcing enough air through your vocal chords.

643
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.140
So you start your talk like this.
Have you heard,

644
00:40:06.141 --> 00:40:08.210
have you ever heard people talking to that?
Oh my God,

645
00:40:08.211 --> 00:40:12.140
I was up at Amy's house the other day and I just felt like she was giving me

646
00:40:12.141 --> 00:40:17.020
this vibe.
Or you have the other people who start off where they,
they,
they,

647
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.030
they,
they push enough air through their vocal cords.

648
00:40:20.031 --> 00:40:23.090
But then towards the end they taper off.

649
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:29.230
Today everyone we're going to be reading about a lady who buy,

650
00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.311
buy,
buy,
buy,

651
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:35.210
buy Bababa that I hit it fucking drives you nuts and never used to bug me until

652
00:40:35.211 --> 00:40:37.310
I took a class on it.
Now I can't stop hearing.

653
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:42.310
So this fucking idiot is sitting there talking like the typical,

654
00:40:43.011 --> 00:40:46.280
like,
I dunno,
she sounded very intelligent,

655
00:40:46.281 --> 00:40:49.250
but all she was talking about was like us magazine Shit.

656
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:54.790
And meanwhile I was listening to a instrumental of a Brian Adams song over the

657
00:40:55.581 --> 00:40:58.580
fucking radio.
You know,

658
00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:02.450
when Brian and his first came out and he had the Fonzi leather jacket,
right.

659
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:06.410
And you're like,
wow,
this guy's good.
He's got some decent towns.
You know,

660
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:10.680
Ken mothers' feel 60 remember that?
And when he was so young,

661
00:41:10.681 --> 00:41:13.540
you thought that that actually rocked,
but it wasn't bad for pop.

662
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.450
And then he just fucking jumped the shark where he's just like,
you know what?

663
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.200
I can't fucking do this anymore.
My face is breaking out.

664
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.990
I can't fucking do it anymore.
I'm just going to sell out.

665
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.890
I want to write a song for chicks.
Richard Marx can do it.
So can I,

666
00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.230
and then he had that song.
Yeah.

667
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.293
<v 4>Okay.</v>

668
00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.730
<v 5>Stay
hot.</v>

669
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.600
That song.
Okay.
Chair.
Yeah,
that's stupid fucking song.

670
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.350
They used to make receptionist tear up all across this country when it would

671
00:41:47.351 --> 00:41:50.120
come on and,
and a dental office.
Um,

672
00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:55.150
they had an instrumental version of that going on as I ate my fucking scrambled

673
00:41:55.151 --> 00:41:56.620
eggs and listen to this fat fuck.

674
00:41:56.621 --> 00:41:59.980
Talk about little house on the prairie with vocal fry.

675
00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.390
So that was probably the low point of the weekend.
Um,

676
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.910
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
You know what I did want to hype,

677
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:11.140
I wanted to hype Jesus Christ.
That was only 10 minutes is no fucking way.

678
00:42:11.141 --> 00:42:14.470
I'm making this one.
This one's going to be short and sweet everybody,

679
00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.490
or shortened mediocre,
however you want to fucking call it.

680
00:42:18.491 --> 00:42:20.260
Let's hit the refresh pray page.

681
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.770
Let's see how the Bruins and the penguins are doing.
Bruins need to win this one.

682
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.150
Got To make sure we make the playoffs so we can fucking lose in the first round.

683
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:32.080
Still one to one after two periods,
two friends of mine,
Billy guard,

684
00:42:32.081 --> 00:42:36.100
Dell and Randy Bowman or Bauman are at the,
uh,

685
00:42:36.101 --> 00:42:37.540
at the penguins game right now.

686
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:41.020
Randy Bauman from Jim and Randy showed WTV in Pittsburgh.

687
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.970
Have a fucking listen.
They're sitting there talking shit,
texting me,

688
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.280
talking shit.
You know,

689
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.700
right before the game about how the penguins were going to kill the Bruins.

690
00:42:51.701 --> 00:42:56.560
You know,
we're having an off year and lo and behold,
you know,
an hour goes by,

691
00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.930
there's no shit-talking.
So I go on the Internet,

692
00:42:58.931 --> 00:43:01.390
there is zero zero after the first fucking period.

693
00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.350
He's fucking asshole penguin fancy.
No,

694
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:08.050
Harry Sinden of the Bruins was actually debating suing the Pittsburgh Penguins

695
00:43:08.051 --> 00:43:12.070
when they switched to black and gold for stealing the Bruins colors.

696
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.080
You know,
I'm going to pause here and let the people in Pittsburgh Exhale,
right?

697
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.340
<v 7>Be like,
hey,
you fucking bitch birch too.</v>

698
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.110
<v 5>Freud's had been around since before the fucking stealers and the Steelers back</v>

699
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:26.960
in the day used to basically have yellow uniforms.

700
00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:30.350
They had that big stupid yellow helmet.
That's what they had.
All right.

701
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.870
And the only black you had was a couple little stripes.

702
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.950
That's all it was back then.
When you play the old 23 skidoo the long,

703
00:43:36.951 --> 00:43:41.060
I say the long pass when you were doing that shit,
so I don't want to hear it.

704
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.010
Um,
and plus,
you know what I mean?
Who?

705
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.620
Who fuck takes the exact same colors as another team in the same league.

706
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.240
Okay.
You started off with your gay little baby blue fucking penguin.
You know,

707
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:54.350
first of all your penguins.

708
00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:59.080
Why am I talking shit that I'm going to get hit with the obvious one was the

709
00:43:59.081 --> 00:44:03.680
last time you guys want a cup 19 CUNY to then shut the fuck up bill.
Fine.

710
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:08.570
I will.
All right.
You just keep joy and that fucking whiny pussy.

711
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.270
He's not a pussy,
but have you ever seen,

712
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.660
I haven't seen anybody wine the way Cindy Crosby wine since fucking,

713
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.370
he's like Danny Ainge on skates pow of power.

714
00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:23.371
Saw play fucking hockey and was a good looking guy with full ruby red lips from

715
00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:28.820
Nova Scotia.
All right,

716
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.920
so whatever,
let's hit refresh again.

717
00:44:30.921 --> 00:44:33.780
Do they at least make the end of the fucking period here?
Come on.
Berlin's.

718
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.170
There we go.
The end of the two.
One to one.
What do you guys say now?

719
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:41.460
They have Billy guard down.
Fucking cock sucker.

720
00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:46.260
All right.
Um,
what was I trying to say here?
Um,
oh,

721
00:44:46.261 --> 00:44:47.810
I know I wanted to hype is,
uh,

722
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.960
one of the fans here on the podcast who will also remain nameless,
um,

723
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.840
has started a fan page for the Monday morning podcast.
Okay.

724
00:44:57.841 --> 00:45:02.070
So I'm actually going to the next level with this podcast.
Um,

725
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:06.780
a lot of times I make references and uh,
you know,
people,
you know,

726
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.360
don't have time to look them up or maybe you do want to go all over the internet

727
00:45:09.361 --> 00:45:13.410
trying to figure out what the fuck I'm talking about.
This guy has a bunch of,
uh,

728
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.350
you know,
has links to some of the references.
He,
you know,

729
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.660
does all that Photoshop stuff.

730
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.450
He does all that computer stuff that I don't know how to describe,

731
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:25.290
but basically if you'd like to check it out at the end of the podcast or maybe

732
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:26.670
follow along,

733
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:32.210
you can go to a page called a www.themmpodcast.com www.themmpodcast.com.

734
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:44.130
No spaces.
Okay.
And there you go.
I'm hyping that for the week.

735
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.840
Um,
see,
this is why I don't hype shit now I just,
whatever flow,

736
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:51.990
I just fucking had his out the goddamn window.

737
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.270
What else did I do here?
You know what I like about San Jose is a,

738
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.890
it is actually a hockey town.
Like I'm in my hotel,

739
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:02.910
they have the NHL Channel and I was sitting there watching hockey night in

740
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:07.020
Canada,
which is Saturday night.
Um,
and I,

741
00:46:07.021 --> 00:46:08.040
what the fuck was I watching?

742
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:11.070
I was watching Toronto versus Ottawa and a that had to go do my show.

743
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.310
But coming up they had a,

744
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.160
the La kings verse to Canadians with any luck,
they fucking beat him.

745
00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.970
They beat him.
You know what I'm going to check.

746
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.960
God knows I've got nothing else to talk about.
On this fucking podcast.
Um,
no,

747
00:46:24.961 --> 00:46:25.794
you know what,

748
00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.280
let's continue this sports theme just so we can get rid of all the people who

749
00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:32.670
aren't into sports and are into other things like politics.

750
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.800
The fuck is up with that and wants to deal with people who were informed.
Um,

751
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.110
on a number of weeks ago,
I actually,

752
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:44.730
I ripped Peyton manning a new asshole and upon listening back to it,
you know,

753
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.240
I actually sounded like half of fucking retard.
I will definitely admit that,

754
00:46:48.241 --> 00:46:51.200
but I still stand by my opinions.
And uh,

755
00:46:51.201 --> 00:46:54.900
I kept bringing up a guy by the name of Terry Bradshaw who has four Superbowl

756
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.660
rings and uh,
you know,
everybody hit me with dude,
you'll need to from late 20.

757
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.720
[inaudible]
well,

758
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:05.721
they have a great article on Terry Bradshaw in sporting news magazine this week

759
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.710
or this month.
I don't really read this magazine,
but I'm,

760
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:15.860
that kid from a Nebraska was on the cover that a Dum,
Dum,

761
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.550
Dum [inaudible] Su Damo Kong sue.
I Dunno,

762
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:25.860
he's got a great fucking name and uh,
the Patriots needed defensive tackle,

763
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:27.990
but I know we're not going to draft high enough to get that guy.

764
00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:29.040
But I just wanted to read about,

765
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.720
cause I figured maybe they talk about other defensive tackles that were

766
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:35.110
available because I have no life.
Um,
but anyways,

767
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:38.350
I opened it up and Lo and behold,
there was a great article about Terry Bradshaw,

768
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:42.420
which basically backs up what the fuck I was talking about.
At least in my world.

769
00:47:42.421 --> 00:47:44.020
It does.
And uh,

770
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:49.021
and they mentioned right in the beginning it said a Bradshaw won his fourth and

771
00:47:49.031 --> 00:47:53.050
final Superbowl ring with an MVP performance for the Steelers at the rose bowl

772
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:54.370
among quarterbacks.

773
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:59.370
Only Joe Montana has that record and it's quite possibly none will ever surpass

774
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:04.660
it.
Okay.
All you Peyton manning fans out there,

775
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:09.400
do you think he's going to get five fucking rings then it'll get for,

776
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.830
I think you could possibly get three.
He's not getting four though.
All right.

777
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.870
And this is coming from fucking Terry Bradshaw,
a man who played the game.

778
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:21.610
This is what,
this is a quote from the article,

779
00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:25.120
the only thing that matters in the prose is winning the super bowl.

780
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.570
I've never had anyone come up to me in my life and say,
hey Terri,

781
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:32.530
how many yards did you throw?
Four.
How many touchdown passes do you have?

782
00:48:32.531 --> 00:48:35.950
It's all about rinks.
Does that sound familiar?

783
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.510
Go listen to the fucking February 8th podcast.

784
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:46.120
Maybe Terry listens to my podcast.
I'll fucking arrogant.
Is that,
um,

785
00:48:46.121 --> 00:48:48.160
but then he says,
uh,
he says it's all about rings,

786
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.680
but do the shit that this guy took.
You know,

787
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:55.330
I knew in the beginning of his career that this guy had a rough time in

788
00:48:55.331 --> 00:48:56.740
Pittsburgh and everybody,
you know,

789
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:00.310
basically treated him like a dumb redneck and uh,

790
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:03.870
kind of like what they did with John Rocker.
I always fought John Rocker,

791
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.210
got a bum deal because I was living in New York and they were basically calling

792
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:13.150
this guy a fucking moron,
redneck and not so many words.

793
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:17.470
And then he comes out and starts trash in New York.

794
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:22.330
And then typical media,
they get to step away like data and insight.

795
00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:23.560
Any of it,
you know,

796
00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:27.580
and all the mets fans get to act like they weren't fucking yelling shit at him.

797
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.390
I used to be doing a bit about that.
That uh,
without of the,
the,

798
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:36.790
the punchline was basically you had date rapists and wife beaters throwing

799
00:49:36.791 --> 00:49:39.160
batteries at a bigot.
That was basically,

800
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:42.820
that was my little fucking social commentary on the John Rocker incident.

801
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.730
Let me get back to this shit.
Not Supporting anything that John Rock has said,

802
00:49:45.731 --> 00:49:47.950
but you know what I mean?
It's like,
you know,

803
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:51.580
if you can gonna fuck fucking throw rocks rocks at a,
at a,
at a Hornet's nest.

804
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:57.400
Yeah.
Yeah.
I Dunno.
Did I almost just say you're going to get stung.

805
00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.750
You know what I almost just created,

806
00:49:58.751 --> 00:50:03.070
there was one of those southern fucking expressions that I love so much faster

807
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:06.850
and Turkey shit through a 10 horn.
I'll tell you that boy,

808
00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.460
that boy fuck a rock up.
You thought a snake was under it.

809
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.080
Anybody from down south can just send me a whole list of those fucking things.

810
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:16.450
Have I already done this on the podcast and I don't remember.

811
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:21.040
I absolutely love those fucking expressions that Boyd fuck mud.

812
00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.680
I don't even know what they mean.

813
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:30.590
That boy would fuck a rock if he thought a snake was under it.

814
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:34.180
How does that make any sense?
But,
but,
but what I love about us,

815
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.150
even though it doesn't make sense,
you,

816
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.040
you understand what the person is saying and there,
there's a genius to that.

817
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.400
So anyways,
um,
let me,
uh,
let,

818
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:47.300
let's read about Terry Bradshaw was the early part of his fucking career

819
00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.390
basically.
Yeah,
they were,
they were shitting all over it.
Well,
why,

820
00:50:50.391 --> 00:50:53.270
why don't we have Terry said here,
he said,
you have to understand something.

821
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:57.500
My first five years were not the best.
I had shit thrown in my face.
I was booed,

822
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:01.460
criticized,
called stupid and dumb players talking about,

823
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.510
we're saying this is a players on his teams were saying,
uh,

824
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.850
we win in spite of him.
He stutters in the huddle.

825
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.620
I had so much of that shit thrown at me.
I got bitter about it.
And my coach,

826
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:17.330
who I thought never defended me in public.
Chuck,
no.
Um,
the thing was,

827
00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:20.540
I was never his chosen one.
I had to sit back and come to grips with all that.

828
00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:23.480
And it was very painful for me.
It wasn't a storybook career.

829
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:27.380
So I take a great deal of pride and being the quarterback of the team that won

830
00:51:27.381 --> 00:51:30.350
all those super bowls.
Yeah.
And the guy never gets to fucking respect.

831
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.300
Do you know before Superbowl 13?
Uh,

832
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:38.540
Thomas Hollywood Henderson said Terry Bradshaw couldn't spell cat if you spotted

833
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:39.770
them,
the sea and the AA.

834
00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.830
So they asked Bradshaw about this and if you watch football,
you know,

835
00:51:43.831 --> 00:51:46.880
we always comes off like this guy just being all silly and joking around.

836
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:48.950
But he goes,
well,
it ticked me off.

837
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:51.860
The thing that ticked me off was nobody defended me.

838
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.480
Who came out on my team and said,
bullshit.
He calls the place,
he sets it up.

839
00:51:56.481 --> 00:51:59.210
Who defended me?
Chuck Noll didn't,
didn't defend me.

840
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.820
The only guy I know was said something was Joe Greene.

841
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:04.890
And then here I got to deal with this thing going into the Superbowl.

842
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.930
What the hell am I going to do?

843
00:52:05.931 --> 00:52:08.990
I'm smart enough to know not to get in that argument with Hollywood Henderson

844
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:13.700
through the media because it's a distraction.
Um,
I don't have time for that shit.

845
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:17.990
Okay,
so I can't spell cat.
If you spot me the c and the t,
uh,

846
00:52:17.991 --> 00:52:19.850
that's some good shit.
Congratulations.

847
00:52:19.851 --> 00:52:23.300
Then you go out and you kicked their asses.
How much has my spelling look?

848
00:52:23.301 --> 00:52:25.390
Now you're the one who had to go to prison.

849
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:33.770
He took it there.
Terry's an angry mother fucker or whatever.
I love it.

850
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.890
I love it.
You know something and he never went back to Pittsburgh.

851
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.920
I didn't even notice that shit when he was done.
He just left.

852
00:52:39.921 --> 00:52:42.890
He doesn't even talk to any of the players.
And he said,
he goes,
I mean,

853
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:46.010
it's kind of a failure of my personality.
I don't know.

854
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:50.210
It's a really interesting article because if you watch him on a,

855
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:54.470
whatever the hell this show is called,
the NFL pregame,
he still plays it up.

856
00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:58.100
Like he says,
you know there's this just this country boy,
but he isn't,

857
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.740
he's fucking sharp as a tack and a,

858
00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:03.470
he didn't like the way he was treated in Pittsburgh and I enjoy that.

859
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.220
I enjoy that considering those guys now,

860
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.140
how seriously they take their team and their fucking quarterback game four super

861
00:53:10.141 --> 00:53:14.990
bowls.
He treated them like such shit.
You know,
I just liked,

862
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:19.940
I liked when teams do that to their fucking players cause it makes Boston fans

863
00:53:19.941 --> 00:53:22.670
look better cause God knows where bunch of fucking assholes,
you know,

864
00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:25.650
kind of like when Montreal booed Patrick was out of town.

865
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.670
I love bringing this shit up and then he goes out to fucking Colorado and

866
00:53:29.671 --> 00:53:33.150
immediately wins the Stanley Cup and then like four years later wins another
one.

867
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:38.390
I love that now Montreal hasn't been a factor since fucking 1993 I love that

868
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:40.710
too.
It's over there.

869
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:45.711
Last dynasty was 1979 they dominated a six team league that spilled over into

870
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:50.100
the expansion six and then everybody got their shit together and you haven't

871
00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:53.760
heard anything from those motherfuckers sense and they're still walking around

872
00:53:53.761 --> 00:53:56.970
with their chest puffed out about some shit that they did back in the three

873
00:53:56.971 --> 00:54:00.840
stooges era.
You know,
it's fucking over

874
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:07.260
30 years ago.
It's been 30 years since you guys dominated the fucking Nhl.

875
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:10.290
All right,
to get off,
you got damn high horses.

876
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.240
All right dad out to get me a couple of emails.
Okay,
let's continue on with the,

877
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:19.080
with the podcast here.
Um,
here's a couple of,
uh,

878
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:23.090
videos if you want to watch this one that I wanted you guys to check out.
Um,

879
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.830
there's a video of your van Halen Fan.

880
00:54:25.831 --> 00:54:30.600
Go on Youtube and check out van Halen and it's a song and the cradle will rock.

881
00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.310
If you just search that,

882
00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:37.420
a bunch of videos will come up and click on this second video down and uh,

883
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:41.400
just look what David Lee Roth is wearing.
It's absolutely fucking hilarious.

884
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:43.560
But I'm telling you,
it's funny as it is,

885
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.230
there's going to be a part of you being like,
God dammit,

886
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.390
I wish I could get away with wearing something like that.

887
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:53.730
Can you imagine the amount of pussy I would get if I wore something like had the

888
00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:56.190
balls to wear something like that.

889
00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.240
For those of you who aren't near a fucking,
I'll basically describe it,

890
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:01.770
who aren't near a fucking computer right now.

891
00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:06.030
Maybe you're on a treadmill trying to work off that Burgee aid at Carl's Jr at

892
00:55:06.031 --> 00:55:08.070
two in the morning.
No one,
you shouldn't have done it.

893
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:11.370
We woke up this morning feeling like you had a fucking anchor in your stomach.

894
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:16.150
You know,
I got it.
Goes fucking sweat it off.
He's basically wearing,
um,

895
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:18.630
picture.
If you,
if you,

896
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:22.680
if you had a zoot suit made out of Spandex and all you were wearing was the

897
00:55:22.681 --> 00:55:27.580
pants.
So they basically came up right underneath your fucking chest,
right?

898
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.160
And then you remember those,
you remember those fucking,

899
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.960
and they're in their purple sparkle to all right.
And then that's it.

900
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:39.270
You don't have anything else on other than,

901
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.290
do you remember those boots that those whores used to wear an aspen in like the

902
00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.123
late seventies,
early eighties,

903
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.900
where they look like they skinned a woolly mammoth.
He has on White,
wooly,

904
00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:50.280
mammoth snow boots.

905
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:54.990
And the greatest thing is the crowd is just fucking stick cause it's early on in

906
00:55:54.991 --> 00:55:58.680
their career.
I don't know if it's from another country.
I have no fucking idea.

907
00:55:58.681 --> 00:55:59.820
I haven't watched it in awhile,

908
00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.730
but I was just remembering it and I wanted you guys just check it out.

909
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:07.520
Jesus Christ.
I told that fucking story in real time.

910
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.520
All right,
here's another one.
Another youtube video somebody sent me.

911
00:56:11.521 --> 00:56:16.521
It says a checkout Dwarf midgets killer movie tie.

912
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.020
M U.
A.
T.
H.
A.
I this is basically it's,
it's very uh,

913
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.850
very accurately,
uh,
described it.

914
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.850
It's one guy is a dwarf and the other guy's a midget or a little person as the

915
00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.520
new way class that they invented a little person and they are,
uh,

916
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.260
they're fighting somewhere.
I'm going to guess,

917
00:56:36.261 --> 00:56:41.261
and maybe the Philippines and it's a Muay Thai fight and it starts off funny.

918
00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:45.780
Then you think it's fake because the midget keeps hitting the dwarf with the

919
00:56:45.781 --> 00:56:48.790
exact same fucking punch.
The dwarf keeps trying to kneel knee,

920
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.590
neither midget and the chest and the midget keeps coming with an overhand right.

921
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:53.940
And I was kept thinking,

922
00:56:53.941 --> 00:56:58.440
why the fuck is he keeps [inaudible] fuck does he keep throwing the same punch?

923
00:56:58.441 --> 00:56:59.370
This must be fake.

924
00:56:59.371 --> 00:57:03.690
But then I realized that the boxing gloves on the midget actually go beyond his

925
00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:06.120
elbow.
So he couldn't throw a hook if he wanted to.

926
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.110
And then after that it just becomes sad.

927
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.250
There's something about the dwarf space where he just really looks like he's

928
00:57:14.251 --> 00:57:18.540
getting,
he's physically at paint.
The Megyn has,
you know,
he's still got that,

929
00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.520
that,
that,
that Christmas twinkle in his eye.

930
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.410
He seems like he's having a good time.

931
00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.870
He's got a little bit of swagger in his wattle.

932
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:29.280
He's probably getting some pussy after the shelf,
you know.
And uh,

933
00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:30.510
that was a good question.

934
00:57:30.511 --> 00:57:32.940
Would you have a lot of Midget Bang you women out there?

935
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.770
I know some guys have banked a little person,
but I was just wondering,
you know,

936
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:40.820
if you just laid down on your stomach and you just felt like that,
like that.

937
00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.010
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

938
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.560
<v 5>At Wiggle and eight year old riding you from behind,</v>

939
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:54.260
do you know how long your hair would have to be so you could actually pull it in

940
00:57:54.261 --> 00:57:57.500
that position?
Why am I being such an asshole this week?
I don't know why.

941
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:59.240
All right.
Next,
uh,
next few to video.

942
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:03.020
I'll tell you why because I don't have a fucking show and I have a show tonight

943
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:06.170
and I'm waiting to take a red eye,
JetBlue,
JetBlue,

944
00:58:06.171 --> 00:58:08.460
back to a JFK.

945
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:13.610
I'm not looking forward to going back to New York this time of year with that

946
00:58:13.611 --> 00:58:17.570
fucking weather.
I really have not missed the winter whatsoever.

947
00:58:17.571 --> 00:58:19.340
That's a big thing they asked from the east coast.

948
00:58:19.341 --> 00:58:24.140
Don't you miss the four seasons?
What?
Frankie Valli and those guys,

949
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.490
is that what you say?
Do I miss the four seasons?
No,
I don't know.
I don't,

950
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:30.230
I like it.

951
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:35.230
I like being old and being in the retirement community that is Los Angeles.

952
00:58:35.241 --> 00:58:39.950
I like it.
It's,
you know what La is like?
It's like a,

953
00:58:39.951 --> 00:58:43.010
it's like Florida for somebody who's still middle aged,

954
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:47.360
you know you go to Florida,
does it die?
That's the last place I'll go.

955
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:51.200
Go out there and get me a gate or boat,
you know?
That's what I'm going to do.

956
00:58:51.201 --> 00:58:54.590
That's how I'm going to parachute out of my life.
I'm going to

957
00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:59.270
probably get a divorce and just say,
listen,
I'm cashing in my chips.

958
00:58:59.271 --> 00:59:02.390
I can't do this.
We had kids all rights fucking over there out of the house.

959
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:05.510
What do we need to stare at each other for the rest of fucking time?

960
00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:07.120
So I sit there,

961
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.460
watch and you slowly gumming those waffles that used to be able to tear through

962
00:59:10.461 --> 00:59:12.230
and an English muffin in a minute and a half.

963
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:16.780
Now we sit here for fucking 37 minutes is I want you,

964
00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.790
I don't want to live that life with you.
Okay?
We had a great time.

965
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.980
I give you a high five,

966
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:25.490
but I'm afraid I'm going to break his shoulder and then I'll go and then I'm

967
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:29.330
going to go down to Florida and I'm just going to get one of those fucking boats

968
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:30.920
with the fan on the back.
And I'm going to give,

969
00:59:30.921 --> 00:59:34.640
I'm going to give everglade tours is they want to play some [inaudible] and some

970
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:38.990
ACDC.
I'm not going to have an affected southern accent and that's it.

971
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.850
Now I'm gonna live off my DVD money even though I won't exist anymore.

972
00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:49.220
Um,
and I'm addressed all in khaki.
Okay,
let's continue on.
Um,

973
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:52.460
the next youtube video that you can look at is,
uh,

974
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.800
there's one called a public access TV hosts bombarded with prank calls,

975
00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.530
is the name of it.
I don't know if this is the right video.

976
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:04.130
Somebody sent this one to me and I accidentally deleted it.

977
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:07.190
So I just buy him describing it.
I think this is the one,

978
01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:11.930
so look it up and it's basically a guy in public access trying to talk about gun

979
01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:16.880
control.
And it's such a low budget that,
you know,
it's not pre,
it's,

980
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:19.610
it's basically live and he puts his phone number up there.

981
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.250
So somebody calls in realized is it's,
you know,

982
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.090
realizes that it's live and tells him to go fuck himself.

983
01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.650
And then the entire audience,

984
01:00:27.651 --> 01:00:31.940
like a bunch of Goddamn children call in in all they're saying is just the

985
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:34.040
dirtiest shit that they can basically think of.

986
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.180
And of the best guys are the ones who actually start talking about gun control

987
01:00:38.181 --> 01:00:42.170
for a minute.
So this guy actually feels like he's having a discussion

988
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.040
and right as the guy who starts to engage with them,

989
01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:50.160
they tell them to go fuck himself.
So if you're an angry prick like me,
it's an I,

990
01:00:50.161 --> 01:00:54.800
it's actually a a,
it's a nice one.
So with that,
um,

991
01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:00.970
I have been on lumosity.com for all of last week,
uh,

992
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.860
trying to get my BPI score to go up,
which is,

993
01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:06.620
I don't even know what the fuck it stands for.
Basically,

994
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:10.880
the higher the number you have,
the less a moron.
I Dunno,

995
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.720
I was going to say retarded,
but I don't like using that word.
Uh,

996
01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.370
even though I've already said it five times his fucking podcast,

997
01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.810
the less dumb you are I guess are the smarter you are the higher it is.
Right.

998
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.030
I got confused in the middle of it.
I don't know.

999
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:25.530
I'm worried about my brain right now,
everybody because a,

1000
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:29.510
it's feeling fuzzy and I think a lot of it has to do with talking on my cell

1001
01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:34.511
phone too much and I'm trying to cut down on that like a cigarette smoker and

1002
01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:38.120
I've been going to this,
this website,
lumosity.com and has these,

1003
01:01:38.121 --> 01:01:42.200
these games that challenge your brain.
It's the fucking awesome.

1004
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:44.090
And they got everything out.
Any,

1005
01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:48.020
any type of any type of stuff that you could be thinking of?

1006
01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:50.630
I don't know if I talked about this last week,
so I'll kind of blow through it.

1007
01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:54.410
It's Lumosity,
l u m o s I t y.com.

1008
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.430
Somebody else else's has suggested one that was,
um,

1009
01:01:58.610 --> 01:02:01.640
I don't know how to read it because it's a website here.
That's all.

1010
01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:06.440
I don't know how to say it here.
It's,
it's www.no spaces here.
Pos,
I,

1011
01:02:06.441 --> 01:02:09.050
t.
S.
C.
I.
E.
N.
C.
E.

1012
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:12.680
So it's post it science pos it,

1013
01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:15.440
science.com.
Um,

1014
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.380
and they have these brain games and I really think in a number of years.

1015
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:22.260
That's right.
I did talk about this last week that they,
that they're basically,

1016
01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:26.670
instead of having all these,
these exercise shows at night that involve,
you know,

1017
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:28.860
getting fucking abs and all that type of shit,

1018
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:31.320
they're actually going to be selling stuff late at night.

1019
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.920
That's going to be basically crunches for your brain.
And um,

1020
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.810
I would recommend it.
It's kind of been my new thing that I do out here.

1021
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.250
I told you I've been trying to learn,
learn how to write with my right hand.

1022
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.810
I'll tell you about that shit.

1023
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:49.380
I'm a lefty and somebody who's a comedian was telling you about this book that

1024
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:50.550
he was reading that uh,

1025
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:54.000
if you actually do things with your opposite opposite hand,

1026
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:58.440
it opens up different areas of your brain.
And,
um,

1027
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:01.920
so I've been doing that,
you know,
I'm writing with my right hand.

1028
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.240
I've been throwing shit around my,
my hotel room with my left hand.

1029
01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:11.610
I'm kind of fucked up where I,
I kind of jump back and forth.
Play Guitar,
lefty.

1030
01:03:11.611 --> 01:03:14.520
I played drums,
righty.
I play sports right handed.

1031
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:19.730
I write lefthanded can use tools either hand fucking rub one out with the left,

1032
01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:22.740
but in a pinch.
Okay,
let's plow ahead.

1033
01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:24.180
So this is the type of Shit I've been doing.

1034
01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:26.640
So I've been learning how to write with my right hand and I basically,

1035
01:03:26.641 --> 01:03:28.440
my handwriting with my right hand looks at,

1036
01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:32.250
looks like my handwriting in like fourth grade.
Um,

1037
01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:38.070
it looks like it if I would,
if I was in the fourth grade and um,

1038
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:42.990
I just saw a ghost.
That's the way it looks.
It's looking very spooky.

1039
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.010
But,
uh,
I've also been trying to learn how to become a better speller.
I just,

1040
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:47.791
you know,
something like,

1041
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:52.530
I always make fun of how the fact that I'm a fucking moron and I'm like Terry

1042
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.600
Bradshaw,
I definitely play up my stupidity,

1043
01:03:54.601 --> 01:03:57.570
but there's definitely a seed of a,

1044
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.190
or maybe some people would say a deep well of stupidity that I actually have.

1045
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:06.600
And most of it,
um,
is odd.
It just laziness.

1046
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:08.161
I mean,

1047
01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:11.730
there's no reason why I should know how to spell the word restaurant at my age.

1048
01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:15.300
I've been to a bunch of them and I've tried to spell it a million times.

1049
01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:16.200
And for the life of me,

1050
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.880
I always forget if the u comes after the first day or the second a.

1051
01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.100
And,
um,

1052
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:26.520
I've tried this a number of times and I'm gonna try to stick with it as I just,

1053
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:27.780
as I,
you know,

1054
01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.890
try to type an email and rather than just hitting spellcheck and just moving on

1055
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:34.560
with my life,
I'm trying to actually make a list of words.

1056
01:04:34.561 --> 01:04:38.670
I don't know how to sell,
sell,
spell,
see how my brain's fucked up.

1057
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:42.870
Um,
and then what I do is I,
then I write,

1058
01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:47.130
I write the word properly,
like 10 times in a row.
Um,

1059
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.720
but I write it with my right hand.

1060
01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.080
So I'm kind of doing two things at once and it's fucking hilarious because I

1061
01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:56.340
kind of left this shit out and I was just thinking of the poor cleaning lady

1062
01:04:56.341 --> 01:04:56.971
coming in here.

1063
01:04:56.971 --> 01:04:59.970
Like one of the words I was learning how to spell was penitentiary.

1064
01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:05.290
So I have penitentiary written like fucking 12 times in this spooky I'm writing

1065
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:06.840
with my opposite hand.

1066
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.820
How can penmanship and I just kept thinking of the shining all work and no play

1067
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:16.200
makes jack a dull boy,
you know?
So,
uh,
I dunno,

1068
01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:21.660
trying to become a smarter human being.
Am I boring the shit out of you?

1069
01:05:21.661 --> 01:05:23.850
Because I think that last segment was a little boring,

1070
01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.420
but I'm into this shit man.
I'm sick of just knowing stuff about sports.

1071
01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.440
I actually,
you know what,
I'm going to Europe in two weeks and,

1072
01:05:30.441 --> 01:05:34.860
and I desperately do not want to come off as the typical stupid American,

1073
01:05:34.861 --> 01:05:38.730
at least I'm in shape.
Okay.
So I'm going to be re,
you know,

1074
01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:41.850
representing us nicely in that category.

1075
01:05:41.851 --> 01:05:46.060
The fact that I'm 41 years old and I'm still fucking and shape Jesus Christ and

1076
01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:47.430
was felt backwards on this chair.

1077
01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.270
I didn't understand how far away the curtains were.
I should have gone with it.

1078
01:05:51.271 --> 01:05:54.300
At least it would have been fucking funny.
Who see if I can lean back here.
Easy,

1079
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:57.760
easy,
easy.
It's not working.
Um,

1080
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.790
oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.

1081
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:06.330
Hang on one second.
Hello.

1082
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:08.040
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1083
01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.230
<v 5>Hey,
let me call you back in like 20 minutes.
Okay.</v>

1084
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:19.380
Okay,
cool.
All right.
But
um,
so anyways,

1085
01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:24.380
uh,
the fuck am I talking about?
I got a,
um,

1086
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:28.450
I got this magazine,
Scientific American because I'm like,

1087
01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.920
I can't keep reading these fucking sports magazines.
And two,

1088
01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.700
there was a guy in there,
these egg heads when they want to,

1089
01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.850
as much as I love trash and people,
if you notice,
you know,

1090
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.610
I just insult the way you look and I say fuck a lot,

1091
01:06:39.611 --> 01:06:43.840
but these guys are actually intelligent human beings and this guy was making fun

1092
01:06:43.841 --> 01:06:45.940
of people who tell stories.

1093
01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:48.340
You ever see those stories where people say they died,

1094
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:52.960
I was dead for two minutes and then I came back and then they come on and they

1095
01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:55.060
start talking about the stuff that they saw.

1096
01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.800
But this the way this scientist guy breaks the shit down.
Scientists guide that.

1097
01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:03.640
I really just say that the way this dude's just shines,
dude.

1098
01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.240
Right Dwight,
he break shit down.
Um,

1099
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.590
it's just fucking brilliant.
He basically says,
you're not dead.

1100
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:16.570
You had a near death experience.
You were in a,
uh,
um,

1101
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:21.070
a a near death state.
You weren't dead.
If you would dead,

1102
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:24.430
you're dead.
They can't bring you back from being dead.

1103
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:26.680
All right.

1104
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.180
Even if you fucking hard stops just because your heart stops the dying process.

1105
01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.100
This guy was,
the way he broke it down,

1106
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:37.180
he said it can take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of hours to

1107
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:41.110
occur depending on the conditions.
So even if somebody,

1108
01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:45.550
unless you get just fucking blown up vaporized,

1109
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.280
even if somebody shoots you in the fucking heart,

1110
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.620
your brain is still going to be firing synapses and whatever the fuck's.

1111
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:53.950
I'm too stupid to know.
What it is,

1112
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:58.150
but it still takes another couple of minutes and other stuff,
like he said,

1113
01:07:58.151 --> 01:07:59.710
can take up to a couple of hours.

1114
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.340
So these fucking people who think they're dead or not dead and they're coming on

1115
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:09.190
TV talking about the shit they saw,
like they,
like they were in another fucking,

1116
01:08:09.191 --> 01:08:12.640
I dunno universe and they weren't.
So he basically,

1117
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:15.670
Deepak Chopra is to you know,

1118
01:08:15.671 --> 01:08:18.400
is on this Larry King show describing what's going on.

1119
01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.870
So the guy basically concludes it with this when a cause one other scientists

1120
01:08:22.871 --> 01:08:25.480
was actually kind of agreeing with Deepak Chopra by saying,
you know,

1121
01:08:25.481 --> 01:08:29.230
there's some stuff out there that we just,
you know,
science,
you know,

1122
01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:33.460
has no explanation for,
and this guy says,
so what?

1123
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.800
The fact that we cannot fully explain a mystery without natural means does not

1124
01:08:38.801 --> 01:08:41.740
mean it requires a supernatural explanation.

1125
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:43.840
It just means we don't know everything.

1126
01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:48.580
Such uncertainty is at the very heart of science and is what makes it such a

1127
01:08:48.581 --> 01:08:50.110
challenging enterprise.

1128
01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:55.060
And in that moment there was a clap of thunder and I realized that science is

1129
01:08:55.061 --> 01:08:57.280
religion for intelligent people.

1130
01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.390
This guy isn't saying that.
There's no god,

1131
01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:07.120
but he's also not listening to some guy half naked dancing around a fucking fire

1132
01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.170
with a chicken foot.
You know what I mean?
So I think that's what I think.

1133
01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:14.200
I think science is religion for intelligent people.

1134
01:09:14.201 --> 01:09:17.740
And I think religion and a lot of ways is science for morons.

1135
01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:23.050
Whenever they can't explain something,
they invent stories of people having,

1136
01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:27.220
you know,
all you can eat fish coming out of a wicker basket or fucking,
you know,

1137
01:09:27.221 --> 01:09:32.190
you got to have faith.
You got to have faith.
It's a fucking cop out.
You know,

1138
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:36.490
if you went to go buy a fucking car and you go,
all right,

1139
01:09:36.491 --> 01:09:39.220
let me let the car wouldn't start up.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

1140
01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:43.540
One of these days that engine's coming back and it's going to be mad and it's

1141
01:09:43.541 --> 01:09:48.520
going to be judging you.
It's ridiculous.
You know?

1142
01:09:48.521 --> 01:09:51.490
Geez,
I don't want to get off on this fucking ramp,
but definitely check it out,

1143
01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:56.170
man.
If you want to read some cool stuff,
it's called scientific American.
And uh,

1144
01:09:56.171 --> 01:10:00.630
I dunno,
I'm kind of on this mission to,
I'm sick of being a moron.
It been,

1145
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:05.550
you know,
I'm sick of being fucking stupid.
I really am.
Um,

1146
01:10:05.551 --> 01:10:10.380
so anyways,
let's get to,
uh,
let's get to underrated overrated.

1147
01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.070
Um,
what are we 38 minutes then look at me.

1148
01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:16.790
I've really could fucking run my mouth when I want to before I get into

1149
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.730
underrated.
Overrated.

1150
01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:21.780
I gotta read this one and I'm going to need some help from you guys on this.

1151
01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:27.090
Um,
listen to this one.
Uh,
this is from some dude.

1152
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.780
Uh,
I believe he's in Italy and he said,
um,

1153
01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.660
I kill women's Libidos for a living.

1154
01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.540
All right,
here we go.
Fucking strap yourselves in for this one.
Hey Bill,

1155
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.210
I just got out of my second of my two longterm relationships,

1156
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:50.280
three plus years,
both of which eerily started and ended the same.

1157
01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:51.900
Uh,

1158
01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.260
both of these girls were well above average in their sexual enlightenment when

1159
01:10:55.261 --> 01:10:57.990
we started dating.
I'm not saying they were super freaks,

1160
01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.640
but the kind of girls that have a porno collection that can rival most guys and

1161
01:11:02.641 --> 01:11:03.990
the toys to match.

1162
01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:07.680
Also the kind of girls that while you're home visiting your parents for the

1163
01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:07.860
holidays,

1164
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.370
we'll want to sneak away from the dinner table and fucking the bathroom.

1165
01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:17.350
Okay.
Anyways.
Um,
it seems that the standards for most of these relations,

1166
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:20.790
the standard for most relationship is that you fuck like rabbits during the

1167
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:24.510
first year.
If you manage to make it past the one year mark,

1168
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:29.670
there is an exponential decay in the pussy rationing until you get married or

1169
01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:33.510
have kids at which time you're pretty much done with the sex except for

1170
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:35.730
birthdays and the anniversary.
However,

1171
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.630
the sex and these two relationships kept going strong through the second year,

1172
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.350
at which point it completely dropped off.
And I'm not just,
I don't know.

1173
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:45.390
Not Kidding,
Jay,
I'm talking just done.

1174
01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:49.200
I had to pull out every trick in the book just to get a sympathy fucking once

1175
01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:51.360
every couple of weeks.
Um,

1176
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.690
I'm in a committed relationship and love these girls.

1177
01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.600
I guess you were in a committed relationship and you love these girls,

1178
01:11:57.601 --> 01:12:00.540
so I guess you didn't fuck around.
All right.
Um,

1179
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.230
and love these girls enough to put up with the bullshit with the idea that we'll

1180
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:07.200
be able to work through the issue and get back on track.
However,
as I learned,

1181
01:12:07.201 --> 01:12:10.380
once the pussy is boarded up,
it's out of business for good.

1182
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:14.700
It's like those fucking horrific strip malls that have been abandoned since the

1183
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:15.870
80s when whatever shit,

1184
01:12:15.871 --> 01:12:19.050
boom economy in the area made those fucking people think they were going to go

1185
01:12:19.051 --> 01:12:23.550
somewhere.
So inevitably when these relationships and I end up,
uh,

1186
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:25.500
I get red,
my,

1187
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:31.070
my fucking straight a report card on how much I'm such a great guy and I'm love

1188
01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.380
so much and they don't want to lose me as a part of their lives,

1189
01:12:34.381 --> 01:12:37.650
but they're just not sexually attracted to me anymore.

1190
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:42.180
And that is the fucking [inaudible] and this is the best fucking part.

1191
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.650
They don't know why.

1192
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.420
They don't know why they're not sexually attracted to me anymore and really wish

1193
01:12:48.421 --> 01:12:50.610
they could change it seriously.

1194
01:12:50.611 --> 01:12:54.390
What the fuck no man wants to admit to himself,

1195
01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:57.480
let alone an audience that he's not getting alone,
that he's not getting,

1196
01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.570
that he's not getting it done.
Between the sheets.
However,

1197
01:13:00.571 --> 01:13:04.380
I can honestly say that I do.
All right.
I'm no fucking Ron Jeremy,

1198
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:05.520
but I get the job done.

1199
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:10.710
I would understand the plight of these women if I was a for blasting them.

1200
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.180
I don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

1201
01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:16.320
Just jumping on him like an 18 year old pounding away or wanting to do the same

1202
01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:17.310
shit over and over again.

1203
01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:21.690
But I usually make a pretty good damn effort to make sure things stay fun in the

1204
01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:26.370
bedroom.
All right.
Okay.
Last two fucking paragraphs.
Uh,

1205
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.540
let me just,

1206
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:32.540
let me just a paraphrase is he basically says that he's like a William h Macy's

1207
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:35.640
character in the cooler.
Um,

1208
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:40.410
and he's saying that he's getting really bitter and he wants to go out right now

1209
01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:43.050
and go meet a woman,
fuck the shit out of her for three months,

1210
01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:47.700
and then give her the same speech that just happened to him.
Um,
all right.

1211
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:51.570
Okay.
First of all,
don't do that.

1212
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.160
Don't deliberately go out and hurt somebody because you dated two people who

1213
01:13:56.161 --> 01:13:59.730
hurt you.
That's just,
it's,
it's bad.
They don't deserve it.
They didn't hurt you.

1214
01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:03.980
So don't do that.
All right.
Um,
I,

1215
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.700
I don't know what,
I mean,

1216
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.430
I'd have to have more details of what the fuck's going on,

1217
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:13.000
but I will tell you this from experience.
I know a lot of people,

1218
01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:19.020
they get into a relationship with somebody and that it doesn't go right.

1219
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.480
They find out that it's not what they're looking for.

1220
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:27.750
And then they go out and then they immediately basically start dating the same

1221
01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:32.110
person again.
It's not literally the same person,
but it's basically,

1222
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:37.560
you know,
like,
just to make it simple,
if a woman went out and was dating,

1223
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:41.830
met some guy at a fucking truck stop and he turns out to be an asshole.

1224
01:14:41.831 --> 01:14:45.100
He's driving a truck,
fucking a bunch of other women around the country.
She goes,

1225
01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:47.530
I'll never fucking get with a piece of shit like that again.

1226
01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.260
And where did she go?
She goes right back down to the truck stop,

1227
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:52.870
which is the same gene pool of fucking people.

1228
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:58.290
And I think it's very interesting that you met two girls who seemed like they

1229
01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:02.620
were the exact same right down to when they want it to stop fucking you.

1230
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.830
And I got to admit,
okay,

1231
01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:11.080
I guess a woman having a porn collection is healthy on some level,
but that,

1232
01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:13.450
you know,
I don't know as far as like a girl you're going to marry,

1233
01:15:13.451 --> 01:15:16.710
it's like you want your girl,
it's that fine line.

1234
01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:19.450
You want them to fuck your brains out,
but do you really want to bang,

1235
01:15:19.451 --> 01:15:24.050
have them want to fuck you and your parents house?
I mean,
I dunno dude.
I'm,

1236
01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.850
I mean,
I,
I what I,
what I would guess is I would,

1237
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.200
I would start fishing in a different lake.
It sounds to me like you,

1238
01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:35.500
you're a fucking God damn trout again.

1239
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:38.800
Can't fucking believe it.
You know,
go out in the ocean,

1240
01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:40.450
you'll catch something else.
You know what I'm saying?

1241
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:44.020
I think he got the same person again.
I mean,
but I mean,

1242
01:15:44.021 --> 01:15:46.780
I would literally have to fucking be knowing what you're doing in the bedroom,

1243
01:15:46.781 --> 01:15:51.190
which I don't want to know.
Um,
well,

1244
01:15:51.191 --> 01:15:53.110
what about you?
Do you start taking,

1245
01:15:53.111 --> 01:15:56.620
I guess you said you don't take her off cause that's another thing that happens

1246
01:15:56.621 --> 01:15:59.290
in relationships.
You know,
there's like,
you know,

1247
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:04.210
big thing with women as they like kissing and uh,

1248
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.830
guys are very focused on the,
on,
on the finish line,
the goal.

1249
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:13.120
So you know,
you're getting that relationship like we haven't had sex in a while.

1250
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:16.180
You want to have sex when he stuck getting in that fucking thing it,
you know,

1251
01:16:16.181 --> 01:16:20.320
and you just start scheduling it.
I see.
How does your day look?

1252
01:16:20.321 --> 01:16:24.220
Maybe around four.
Okay.
Okay.
We will fuck it for,

1253
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.180
you know,
and then you know,

1254
01:16:27.181 --> 01:16:29.380
you're not even self conscious so there's no excitement.

1255
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.710
You just fucking take your clothes off.
Like you're getting stripped,

1256
01:16:31.711 --> 01:16:34.770
searched on your way to serving time at fucking,
uh,

1257
01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:37.930
some penitentiary,
penitentiary,

1258
01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.820
p e n I t and t I a r y penitentiary.

1259
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.331
Sorry,

1260
01:16:46.331 --> 01:16:49.030
it's one of the words I learned this week and I was trying to remember Rikers

1261
01:16:49.031 --> 01:16:53.770
island and I couldn't at that point.
So dude,
I don't know what to tell you.

1262
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:56.260
The bottom line.
I don't give a fuck who you are,
how I'm in love.

1263
01:16:56.261 --> 01:16:58.570
You are with somebody.
After a while you're going to get sick of fucking them.

1264
01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.210
That's what happens.
Um,

1265
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:05.320
I dunno,
I dunno what's going on.

1266
01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:09.170
I don't know if you have some sort of like delayed halitosis where for the first

1267
01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:12.260
two years you have wonderful breath and then all of a sudden it's unbearable.

1268
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:14.660
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't wanna give you a complex,
but I'm just saying,

1269
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:18.230
I don't know what I would try to,
to,
uh,
meet girls in a different place.

1270
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:21.140
I would start with that.
And um,

1271
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:26.660
I dunno.
I Dunno dude.
This one is beyond me.
I've never,
uh,

1272
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.060
I mean,
part of me wants to say you'd be,

1273
01:17:30.061 --> 01:17:34.370
you're being a little too hard on yourself here.
Uh,
but whatever,

1274
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.300
go out there and,
uh,
you know,
go bang some fucking women.
You're single.

1275
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.210
Go out there banks and fuck a woman.
And as always,

1276
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:44.810
always talk to women that you think are Rati eleague always do that shit.

1277
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:46.370
The worst thing they can do is say no,

1278
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.660
but one of them is going to fucking say yes and that'll give you more confidence

1279
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:53.600
and you'll keep moving up the draft board.
Next thing you know,

1280
01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:57.440
you pull in pussy out of the first round rather than drafting like you're

1281
01:17:57.441 --> 01:18:00.650
fucking won the Superbowl last year.
You know,
having that 28th pick,

1282
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.210
praying that the female version of fucking Dan Marino is still around.

1283
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.740
That didn't make sense.
But you know what I'm saying.
Um,
anyways,

1284
01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.380
am I almost done here?
46 minutes in 46 minutes into the podcast.

1285
01:18:15.381 --> 01:18:18.980
Let's wrap this shit up here.
People with a little bit underrated.
Overrated.

1286
01:18:18.981 --> 01:18:20.900
Shall we underrated a bill.

1287
01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:25.100
Last week you got an email from a fan that recounted,
uh,

1288
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:27.500
his sister's Wiccan wedding.
Personally,

1289
01:18:27.501 --> 01:18:30.350
I think the ritual was that was discussed in the wedding.

1290
01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:32.870
His fucking mind numbingly insane,
but pardon me.

1291
01:18:32.871 --> 01:18:35.930
Has to give it up to the couple that got married.
I'll,
sorry.

1292
01:18:35.931 --> 01:18:39.680
Underrated as a having balls.
Um,
they knew their ritual would,

1293
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.140
would not be well received,
but they did not give a fuck.

1294
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.440
It was their day and they had the conviction to do what they wanted,

1295
01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:49.010
even knowing that their family and guests would not warmly receive the whole

1296
01:18:49.011 --> 01:18:53.630
jibberish chanting and bloodletting.
Okay.
So there you go.

1297
01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.970
Having the balls to a fucking annoy everyone in your family.
Um,

1298
01:18:58.971 --> 01:19:01.730
another quick thing,
a hit,
some people are traveling to Boston.

1299
01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:04.820
They know that I grew up there and I also fucking travel around the country and

1300
01:19:04.821 --> 01:19:08.120
this guy said,
hey bill,
I'm going there with my wife.
She used to,

1301
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:13.370
she used to live there,
but I would also,
uh,
you know,
so she knows where to go.

1302
01:19:13.371 --> 01:19:16.220
I'd like to know,
you know,
have you tell me where to fuck the,
I'm paraphrasing,

1303
01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:20.980
obviously.
Um,
I haven't lived there since 1995 too.
So,
um,

1304
01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:24.740
I'm going to try to tell you to go to some of my favorite place because from

1305
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:26.270
back in the day,
I would start,

1306
01:19:26.271 --> 01:19:30.710
go to Kathy's liquors on route one in Saugus right before,
you know,

1307
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:36.080
get a good six pack and yet maybe some Michelob and then,
uh,

1308
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:39.380
go up to the,
uh,
go up to the cow loon,
gets some fucking Chinese food.

1309
01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.720
Then of course,
another great liquor store out in,
uh,

1310
01:19:44.721 --> 01:19:47.240
out in the Boston areas out in Brockton,
Massachusetts.

1311
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.210
Go to Blanchard's liquor store.
I'll buy the West Gate Mall.

1312
01:19:50.211 --> 01:19:53.030
You might want to check if that's still there,
but I know the bowling alley is,

1313
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.890
that's a great place.
You know,

1314
01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.210
go out there and put on some flock of seagulls and try to talk to some chick

1315
01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:00.440
with way too much.
Uh,

1316
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:05.770
who drew a triangle of pink on both of her cheeks?
I'm,

1317
01:20:05.771 --> 01:20:08.190
I'm just fucking with you.
The penalty.
Go to a Bruins game.

1318
01:20:08.191 --> 01:20:12.750
Go and stop by the penalty box.
That's a good bar.
It's really alcohol based.

1319
01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:17.490
Stay away from the freedom trail.
Okay.
Stay away from the freedom trail.

1320
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:21.990
I don't know about you guys,
but there's nothing more boring to me anyways.

1321
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:26.550
Then the a revolutionary war.
It is mind numbingly boring.
Uh,

1322
01:20:26.551 --> 01:20:28.830
with the old weaponry.
It's like,
you know,

1323
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.330
it's like the original Atari after you saw this playstation shit we've been

1324
01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:37.020
doing for the last,
you know,
50 years.
So all you hear that shit.

1325
01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:37.883
Does she sing it again?

1326
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:39.950
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1327
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:43.900
<v 5>Wait a second.
Wait for it.
Not a fucking guy in the violin.</v>

1328
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:47.310
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1329
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:48.690
<v 5>Can you hear it?
You probably can't fucking hear.</v>

1330
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:56.270
All right.
Um,
oh,
when somebody sent me something,

1331
01:20:56.271 --> 01:20:57.990
and this is the last thing I'll tell you guys before I'll,

1332
01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:00.380
I'll tell you all they have a good fucking week as I always do.

1333
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.500
Try and to enter on a nice positive note.
Uh,
hey,

1334
01:21:03.501 --> 01:21:06.650
let me hit refresh here just to see who won this foods one in this fucking game.

1335
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:11.390
Come on,
refresh
Jesus Christ.

1336
01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:15.140
He isn't it unbelievable how quickly your fucking computer gets old.

1337
01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.660
It's like cool for the first fucking week.

1338
01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:20.780
And then you download a couple of things and then it's like,
you know,

1339
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:24.410
it's like Brad Pitt at the beginning of that movie where he played the old baby.

1340
01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:26.450
Anybody see that movie?

1341
01:21:26.451 --> 01:21:28.940
I don't think I've ever laughed so fucking hard and my life.

1342
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:33.350
And when that guy came in and he was trying to get some pussy and he hears and

1343
01:21:33.351 --> 01:21:35.240
he looks down,
it was that little old baby.

1344
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.410
You want to talk about killing a fucking woman's,
a guy's libido.

1345
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:44.240
The fuck is going on with my computer.
I didn't have the thing.

1346
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:46.280
I actually have dial up right now if you can believe it.

1347
01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:49.520
That's probably another one of the problems out right here we go.
Come on.

1348
01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:53.780
Come on.
You fucking cunts.
Two to one.

1349
01:21:53.781 --> 01:21:57.890
Pittsburg eight Oh four left.
I like it though.
I forget the name of the guy,

1350
01:21:57.891 --> 01:21:59.010
but we have a new defenseman.

1351
01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.790
Maybe that'll help us to make up for the fact that we don't have Phil Kessel

1352
01:22:01.791 --> 01:22:05.330
anymore,
even though for some reason a lot of people don't like him.
So anyways,

1353
01:22:05.331 --> 01:22:07.010
this guy,
something,
this last thing,
I'll read you guys.

1354
01:22:07.011 --> 01:22:08.690
This guy sent me something about,
uh,

1355
01:22:08.691 --> 01:22:11.840
you know I was talking about when you go into go buy things and people asked for

1356
01:22:11.841 --> 01:22:16.490
your phone number and all this fucking information and if fucking creeps me out

1357
01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.750
every time they do that,

1358
01:22:17.751 --> 01:22:20.750
I just think that they should play in the beginning of that iron main song,

1359
01:22:20.751 --> 01:22:21.584
the prisoner,

1360
01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.810
he remember that from the eighties do you remember how that thing went?

1361
01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:29.653
<v 8>You remember this?</v>

1362
01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.310
<v 5>The new number two?
What was number one?</v>

1363
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.930
You are number six most cycle left ever.

1364
01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.850
Can you imagine if your fucking dad would laugh at you like that back in the
day?

1365
01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:59.730
Be like,
son,
how many beers did you have the night?
You're just like,

1366
01:22:59.731 --> 01:23:00.880
I just had to,

1367
01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.190
all right and is fucking Dallas and the lights start dimming.

1368
01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:09.550
It's going to be over.
So anyways,
this fucking guy.

1369
01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.440
Does that make any sense by the way?
I don't know.

1370
01:23:11.441 --> 01:23:12.970
I'm fucking sitting here with one microphone.

1371
01:23:12.971 --> 01:23:17.080
No headphones in a fucking hotel room.
This is what you get.
All right,

1372
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.810
so this guy said,
Bill,

1373
01:23:19.811 --> 01:23:22.540
can you believe how much fucking information people are willing to give away?

1374
01:23:22.541 --> 01:23:25.660
For No to strangers for no reason.
He goes,

1375
01:23:25.661 --> 01:23:29.110
I got my hair cut the other day and the first thing they say to me before hello,

1376
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:33.520
or what can I do for you is the first thing out of the gate is what's your phone

1377
01:23:33.521 --> 01:23:38.050
number?
So I say,
why do you need my phone number?
She says,

1378
01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.330
so we know who you are when you come in.

1379
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:44.460
Which is bullshit because they don't know you when you come in.

1380
01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:47.320
They still have to ask what your God damn number is.
C,

1381
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:51.400
he got to love someone who actually fucking uses their brain.
So anyway,
she goes,

1382
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:53.440
he says,
I don't want to give you my number.

1383
01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:57.460
So then she scoffs in his face and says,

1384
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.620
we don't send the information out to anyone.
It's just to keep track of you here.

1385
01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:07.300
That's it.
Um,
and then she says,
uh,
then okay,

1386
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:09.700
then the guy says,
he,
the guy written,
wrote this really badly here.

1387
01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.910
So then I guess he responds to,
that doesn't make me feel any better.

1388
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:15.010
You don't need my phone number to cut my hair.

1389
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:18.310
Then this slag does this fine.

1390
01:24:18.311 --> 01:24:22.840
Whatever that sounded exactly like your exaggerated impression of a dumb broad.

1391
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:27.550
Then she goes,
how about your address too?
This is fucking,

1392
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:31.750
you know what all these corporations are sharing this information to figure out

1393
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:36.280
exactly what you buy when you buy it,
what you liked the best.

1394
01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:40.660
So they can just fucking,
I don't know what,
you know,

1395
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:46.630
Jack,
the prices of the shit up.
So anyways,
um,
she goes,
how about your address?

1396
01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:50.590
And the guy goes,
what are you going to do?
Drop the hair,
cut off at my house.

1397
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:53.880
Just cut my fucking,
uh,

1398
01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:57.400
now there's three people in line behind me in this worthless tub of come.

1399
01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:02.020
Jesus leans around me and says,
and says,
I guess to the people behind them,

1400
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:06.370
sorry,
this takes longer.
When they,
then he writes,
they,
you know,

1401
01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:11.500
don't give any information.
And then he says sarcastically.
Oh,

1402
01:25:11.501 --> 01:25:15.010
I see.
I'm the one compliment a complicating this transaction.

1403
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:18.880
And it's not even her fault.
It's her.
Oh.
And it's not even her fault.

1404
01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:22.180
It's her corporate creep bosses and all the fucking sheep that let people do

1405
01:25:22.181 --> 01:25:26.170
whatever they want.
Sorry,
this is so long.
Well,

1406
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:28.840
you should apologize to my listeners because they had to listen to me read it.

1407
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:31.270
Yeah,
man,
don't give those people your fucking phone numbers.

1408
01:25:31.271 --> 01:25:35.500
Don't give him your address.
I do.
That can,
can we get your phone number?
I had.
No,

1409
01:25:35.501 --> 01:25:39.430
you can't.
We're not going to do anything with it.
I,
that's fine.
That's fine.

1410
01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.110
I know you're not going to do anything with it.

1411
01:25:41.111 --> 01:25:42.280
I don't want you to have my phone number.

1412
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.580
What do you call me up and see how my fucking hair cuts going?

1413
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:48.850
Is it still short and you think you need an adjustment?

1414
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.500
Did I tell you that story?

1415
01:25:50.530 --> 01:25:55.120
But when I went into cvs and that guy who looked at what the peewee Herman

1416
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.400
Haircut,
there was two,
two foreigners in front of me,

1417
01:25:57.401 --> 01:26:00.390
they barely spoke English and they asked if they wanted one of those savings

1418
01:26:00.391 --> 01:26:04.620
save cards.
And they said no.
And he goes,
all right,
I'll just scan one anyways.

1419
01:26:04.621 --> 01:26:08.130
And he scans it.
So I walk up and I'm ready for this guy.
He goes,

1420
01:26:08.131 --> 01:26:11.600
do you have our little savy saved card?
And I say,
no,
I don't.
And he goes,
well,

1421
01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:13.750
I'll just scan it anyways and I got,
no,
I don't want you to do.

1422
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.790
And then he scanned it and I said,
I said,
excuse me,
what did I just say to you?

1423
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:21.360
I just said,
I don't want that.
And you scanned it anyways.

1424
01:26:21.361 --> 01:26:23.550
Why did you just do that?
And he goes,
it's all right.

1425
01:26:23.551 --> 01:26:25.950
I'll let it scan it and let and scan it.
And I go,
well,
what do you get?

1426
01:26:25.951 --> 01:26:30.860
Like half a cent for every person that you get.
You know
that,
that,

1427
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:35.370
that you get on the fucking list there.
And he goes,
no,
I don't.
It's like,
really?

1428
01:26:35.371 --> 01:26:38.250
Is that why you can't make eye contact with me?
You fucking piece of shit.

1429
01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:43.290
He probably didn't even on scan the God damn thing.
You know?

1430
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:46.050
I don't understand people that help out corporations.
I just don't,

1431
01:26:46.051 --> 01:26:50.250
have they done anything to demonstrate that they give a flying fuck about you or

1432
01:26:50.251 --> 01:26:52.950
the drinking water in your town?
Don't help those cons.

1433
01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.680
I mean you can if you want to,
but that's just,
I would just,

1434
01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.190
I think it would be a better world if these fucking pricks did know every God

1435
01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:01.800
damn thing about you.
You know,

1436
01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:04.680
pretty soon you're going to walk in there and they're going to fucking asked if

1437
01:27:04.681 --> 01:27:05.450
you can put a,
uh,

1438
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:09.480
did they can just bug you like gene Hackman in the conversation.
Right.

1439
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.540
All right,
do it.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
You know what?

1440
01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.900
I'm going to go down and listen to this lady singer songs so I don't have to

1441
01:27:15.901 --> 01:27:18.360
think there's a nice little crowd down there.

1442
01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.120
Has got to be at least 26 people down there,

1443
01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:25.110
which I think in downtown San Jose actually constitutes a mob.

1444
01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.890
Maybe somebody will get tased and shot in the abdomen.
I don't know what.

1445
01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:32.430
All right,
that's the podcast for this week.
Thank you guys so much for listening.

1446
01:27:32.431 --> 01:27:36.630
I am in currently revamping my website and I hope that everything's going to be

1447
01:27:36.631 --> 01:27:39.770
up to speed.
I recently went over,
uh,

1448
01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:43.170
10,000 people on my mailing list,
so I'm really excited about that.

1449
01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:47.490
And if you want to know what's going on,
you know,
especially like if you see,

1450
01:27:47.491 --> 01:27:48.324
you know,

1451
01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:52.710
when I switched over to a lipsin with the podcast and all that fucking shit,

1452
01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.920
if you were out of the loop,
it's cause you weren't on my mailing list.

1453
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:58.650
I'm not sure.
You know how funny is this?
How funny is this?

1454
01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.480
I how fucking hypocritical of mine.

1455
01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:03.050
I just said don't give you phone number out to these.

1456
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:06.030
<v 4>And now here I am asking for your web address.</v>

1457
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
[inaudible].
