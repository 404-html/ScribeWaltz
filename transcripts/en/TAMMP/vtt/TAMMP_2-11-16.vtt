oh,
I'm going back down the rabbit hole.

8
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:30.050
this Thursday.
I know it's supposed to be about you on Thursdays.

9
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:33.860
Mondays it's about me,
but on Thursdays it's supposed to be about you.

10
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.810
You know what I mean?
You sitting there,

11
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:40.811
you sit near with that Styrofoam Cup dragging up Cuppa Joe America don't work

12
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:50.360
without,
you know,
we sing singing those condescending socks to the working man.

13
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.280
Gai puts his fucking pants on one leg in a tab.
Joe Six pack.

14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.653
Yeah.

15
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.730
Goes to the track every once in a while has an occasional,
so again,

16
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.843
you know,

17
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.230
laughs it a racist joke every 7.2 days,
you know,

18
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.240
never questioned it.
Um,
yeah,
I'm going down the rabbit hole this week cause I,

19
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.074
you know,
I,

20
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.350
I would like a little bit credit after the Superbowl for being a fucking

21
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:24.420
gentleman as a Patriot fan.
Okay.

22
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.930
And you Bronco fans better know what I'm talking about.
I was a gentleman.

23
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.970
You know what's so funny?

24
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.500
A lot of you orange cones get your fucking heads so far up your fucking Bronco

25
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:38.390
assets that you don't even know what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.460
You think I'm talking about because you guys kicked my team's Ash,
right?

27
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:44.330
Not really kicked our ass.

28
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.000
Fucking one in the last second took the whole fucking game to win.
Right.

29
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.870
You think that I'm fucking saying that I was nice that actually rooted for

30
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:54.620
Peyton manning and the Broncos.
No,
that's not what I'm talking about.

31
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:58.220
You know what I'm talking about?
You have to,

32
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:00.800
Tom Brady went through that fucking to deflate gate thing.

33
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:04.490
Went to the entire baseball season.
Air Pressure.

34
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.130
Okay.
You know,

35
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.070
you would think if that's what happens with air pressure.
What if a certain,

36
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:17.071
someone had a certain something shipped to his certain house to a certain wife.

37
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.170
<v 0>And that certain someone is in the fucking Superbowl,
Jesus Christ,</v>

39
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.290
if they can make a fucking air pressure and eight month fucking Goddamn story on

40
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:32.290
Espn,
how long is this thing going to last answer.

41
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.950
Zero seconds wasn't able to fucking story.

42
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.130
Okay.
And you know what?
And I loved it.
It happened.

43
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.300
I loved that they did make a big fucking deal out of it.
You know,

44
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:44.380
cause I don't think they should.

45
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.780
I think we're all going to be on roids in the future.
In the future,

46
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:53.320
we're all going to be jacked.
Right?
In the future,

47
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:56.140
they're going to have like a fucking 80 enrolled or like heavyweight division.

48
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 3>Sorry,
I'm eating a Hershey's kiss.
I just had something salty.
I apologize.</v>

49
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.850
Very rude.
You know,
I'm just saying

50
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.580
what I loved about how that happened is I'm never going to lose another fucking

51
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:17.581
argument that there is a fucking witch hunt or that was a fucking witch hunts.

52
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.240
Okay.
If you're going to fucking,
you know,

53
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.350
go fucking ballistic about that Horse Shit,
you know,

54
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.890
then all somebody has to come out and serves your skus.
Doing I own.

55
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.340
Jude just makes me,
Shit.
I'm good.
How are you?
Where'd you come from?

56
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.230
And then that's it.
It's over.
It's over.
Done.
I don't know about you guys,

57
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.730
but I don't really have any more questions.

58
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.550
Take it off the board.
Now the case solved.
Um,

59
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.970
fucking unbelief.
I was a gentleman.
Oh,
it was generally me.
Not,

60
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.650
not even naming names.
You know what I'm talking about?

61
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.970
Everybody knows who the fuck I'm talking about.

62
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.590
I'm just being a fucking gentleman.

63
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.010
I'm just a gentleman right now sitting in here and some fucking basketball

64
00:03:58.011 --> 00:04:02.300
shorts.
Eaton Hershey kisses.
Just talking.
Just talking to myself.
Oh,

65
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.010
I'm having another one.
Who's a fucking annoying content.

66
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.200
Makes Hershey's kisses.
I don't fucking get it.

67
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.873
<v 4>No,</v>

68
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.970
<v 3>thank God.
We have to make sure that these kisses also doesn't make popcorn.</v>

69
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.990
Or you have to fucking unwrap each goddamn colonel popped.
Right?

70
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.730
Am I doing 80 standup right now?
Why

71
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.460
Urgent?
Urgent.
So small?
You know,
I bet they make bigger ones now for fat fucks.

72
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.520
I gotta look that up.
What should I Google here?

73
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.520
The Hershey kiss for a fat fuck.

74
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.850
I gotta do it now just to see if something comes up.
Do.

75
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:46.090
My dog looks so fucking cute right now.
She's completely just like,

76
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:48.750
she has her bed and um,

77
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.430
nobody fucking lies down on a bed like a dog.

78
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:55.250
Just cause they're pack animals and they don't need their space.
They,
they,

79
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:58.870
they liked being in each other's spaces,
laying down on top of each other.

80
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.790
She fucking,
she's laying there right now.

81
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.170
She looks like a fucking lion just laying in a cage.
Except she's got a bed.

82
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.760
There was no cage.
Surely doesn't look like a lion.
She was like a dog.

83
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.320
She's chilling.
That's what I'm trying to say.
All right.

84
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.030
How when I say Hershey kiss her,

85
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:17.110
she is the one chapter,
they have a Hershey kiss

86
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.600
<v 4>for fat.
Fuck.</v>

87
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.300
<v 3>You know there's going to be a hit here.
Hershey kisses.
This annoys me.</v>

88
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.600
Irish people taste test her.
She kisses.

89
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.960
Oh,
let me guess.
Sick gonna shit on America's chocolate.
When the fuck go Europe.

90
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.700
Is it just enough already?
You know what I mean?

91
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.060
Isn't it enough that we accepted the fact that you stole Blues Music after we

92
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:46.440
stole it and then brought it back to us?
We were nice about it.
Didn't we?
Um,

93
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.660
all right.
Albert Albert's supersized supersize Hershey's kits.

94
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:54.840
And then there's no way they're going to say for fat.
Fuck,
come on bill.
Let's,

95
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.700
let's,
let's be intelligence about this.
All right.
Hershey kiss for supersize,

96
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.230
but then they're not going to be able to say that cause Mcdonald's uses that,

97
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.900
right?
Supersize which all just means for fat fucks,
right?

98
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.240
Kisses giants,
milk chocolate,
seven ounce package images for her.

99
00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:16.370
She kits the Suez.
Supersized.
There they are.
Oh yeah.

100
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.680
You know somebody fucking complaint.

101
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.190
You know some fucking,

102
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.760
you know as people that breathe like biggie smalls,

103
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.610
that kind of out of shape,
they have sleep apnea.
Even when they're awake.

104
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:32.870
You know,
they called up the Hershey

105
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.110
kisses department,
please.
Oh,

106
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.200
you can work so much.
Okay,
I'm going to burn so many calories.

107
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.260
You know,
it's just so fucking gross to them.

108
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.680
Like it was just gross to you that they just said,
fine,
we'll make a bigger,

109
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.690
you know,
just imagine how much more aluminum foil that was

110
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.330
some poor kid fucking thrown out his back picking up those giant chocolate

111
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:05.840
fucking kisses.
They're really not that much bigger.

112
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.940
Oh Fuck,
you may have those peanut butter ones.
What am I talking about?

113
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:14.820
He achieves his Christ.
Let's,
let's continue on here.
So anyways,
um,

114
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.270
I am going to have a good time with that when I go to,

115
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:21.560
I'm actually going to Cheyenne,
Wyoming in Denver,
Colorado,

116
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.820
and uh,

117
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.820
all the fun I'm going to have in Denver wishing them a happy celebration for the

118
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.630
Super Bowl win and uh,
you know,
you know,
and I have a couple of the,

119
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.100
you know,
choice words to say

120
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.290
and you know,
the best part is as much as if I don't think I'm going to do it,

121
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.730
but if I do it as much as they boo and as loud as they boo in the back of their

122
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:53.390
heads,
they know I'm fucking right.
I challenge anyone of you guys,

123
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:57.350
send me your fucking email right now and you tell me that there isn't some

124
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.760
unbalanced fucking going after the Patriots thing after that fucking horse shit.

125
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:05.480
If the flight date is an eight month story and that fucking thing is eight

126
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:10.450
seconds.
Oh,
what a gentleman.
I didn't say shit too.

127
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.260
I alluded to it,
but I,
you know,
still not naming names,
we had protection issues.

128
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.680
Um,
it's not a story

129
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.450
anyway,
so I'm going to Wyoming and a,

130
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:29.300
I drove through it a long time ago and saw these things that look like deer,

131
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:32.240
but I knew they weren't,
you know,
so I was just like,
wow,
where the fuck am I?

132
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.380
Even though I knew I was in Wyoming,
right.
It's,
podcasts is all over the place.

133
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.140
Um,
let me,
uh,

134
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.760
so I looked up Wyoming on Wikipedia.
Who's getting here?
I went to Wikipedia.

135
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.910
I didn't even go to Wikipedia.
I just wrote Wyoming.
And Wikipedia always,

136
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.170
always comes up,
right?
It's just a great website.
You know,

137
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:53.810
you just read a bunch of things about the thing that you looked up and

138
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:55.530
afterwards you feel like you studied something

139
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.610
<v 0>and then you throw it out at a party and he'd go,
yeah,
it does.</v>

140
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.490
And then eventually you run into somebody that's an expert on it and then you

141
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:05.280
realize halfway through it and then he like,
you know,
I had fuck Yale,

142
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.430
walk away doing the,
uh,
the Wikipedia shuffle as you walk away.

143
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.470
So many ways I found out that Wyoming
is,

144
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.333
um,

145
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.710
I bet somebody there named their kid ohmic you know their first name?
Oming

146
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.190
so they can be like Wyoming.
How are you doing?
Sorry.
Jesus.
Brutal podcast.

147
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.920
All right.
This article includes a sort of a listing of the United States,
50,

148
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.700
50 United States by population density cause I immediately found out that

149
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.210
Wyoming,
Wyoming is the

150
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.870
second least densely populated state.
All right,

151
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.680
so here we go.
Let me get to the list here.
Density,

152
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.560
state ranks.
Here we go.
All right,
the top one.

153
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.540
What do you think it is now?
This is density.
This is not population.

154
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.740
This is like elbow room.
Okay.

155
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.330
Density.
Uh,

156
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:12.350
the most densely populated state is you'd never guess this and this shoot New

157
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.450
Jersey,
I never would have guessed that most densely populated was New Jersey.

158
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:22.110
That's because of all the costs that can't afford to live in Manhattan right

159
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:26.190
along the coast,
I think.
Um,
then there's Rhode Island.
It's the number two.

160
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.870
Massachusetts is number three.

161
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.230
It's all the small ones on the east coast with a white man first.

162
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:35.850
Landed right first started banging away,

163
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.180
first said to the native Americans,
what do you call that stuff back?

164
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:43.940
And you teach us how to grow it right before they took it from him.

165
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.540
Um,
Connecticut,
Maryland,
Delaware,
New York,

166
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.450
Florida.
Right.

167
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.170
Wherever you loser with a dream from the east coast.

168
00:10:55.171 --> 00:11:00.171
Fucking vacations do with going can you afford my is my cousins has a boat.

169
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.770
Uh,
Pennsylvania in Ohio,
that's the top 10 most densely populated.

170
00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:10.460
I was surprised when he was 11 was not in the top 10.
Granted,

171
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.170
I live in Los Angeles.
All right.
Least populated state.
What do you guess,

172
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.010
what do you got?
What do you got?
Alaska.
All right,

173
00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:24.011
here we go is the top least populated from a number 10 all the way down to

174
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:27.980
number one,
number one being the least densely populated.
All right.

175
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.510
Kansas and Nevada and Nebraska,
Idaho,
New Mexico,

176
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.820
South Dakota,
North Dakota,
Montana,
Wyoming in Alaska.

177
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.760
So there you go.
And generally speaking,

178
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:45.560
I guess we are a very densely populated country and uh,
you know,

179
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.370
yeah.
You'd think I would notice that the amount of traveling I've done,

180
00:11:49.371 --> 00:11:51.740
the only time I really noticed it was when I went to Asia and I was like,

181
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:53.980
Jesus Christ is a lot of fucking people over

182
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.150
<v 3>here.
You know?
That's all you do when you go to Asia.
You Go,
holy fucking shit.</v>

183
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.790
Look all these stuff.
They'd fucking stuck all these apartment buildings.

184
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.400
Look at them all.
They're all filled.
There's laundry hanging out every window.

185
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.453
Um,

186
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.220
isn't it amazing that there's a billion people in China and they all have shirts

187
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:13.990
to give a fucking thought about?
Stuff like that.

188
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.820
Like who the fuck made all those shirts?

189
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.310
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

190
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.820
<v 3>you'd take with all those fucking pee,
all those shirts that needed to be made.</v>

191
00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:23.250
What do you think that you would know?
Somebody that makes shirts.

192
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.150
I don't know anybody in the clothing industry yet.
Everybody.

193
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.350
Everybody in the fucking,
that's unbelievable.

194
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.230
As much as many rollerblades as they sold,
right?
Everybody didn't have them,

195
00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:38.220
but everybody's got a shirt,
right?
Everybody's got to cover up the junk.

196
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:40.890
Even the strippers.

197
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.630
Even strippers have to walk out with some clothes right before they take it off.

198
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.630
All right.
This article is about the u s state,

199
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:52.290
Wyoming Wyoming's estate and our mountain region of West.
We know all this shit.

200
00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:55.380
The United States [inaudible] popular.
It's a,

201
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.700
why the fuck is it?
Come on.

202
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.600
The Western two thirds of the state is covered mostly with the mountain ranges

203
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.200
and the range lands in the foothills of the eastern rocky mountains.

204
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.630
Is this God's country here?
While the eastern third of the state is high,

205
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.010
high elevation prairie known as the high plains.

206
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.600
Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city in Wyoming with the

207
00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:22.601
population estimate of this is the most populated city in Wyoming.

208
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.710
A population of 62,448 people as of 2013

209
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.790
62,448 people.

210
00:13:34.791 --> 00:13:39.230
Do you realize what a that that that is?
That's a dream.

211
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.330
It's a dream.
You know what the sad thing is?
Most people like myself,

212
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.810
I would go there and I would go crazy because there was nothing to do.

213
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.330
Look at these fucking pictures.
It's almost like a Clint Eastwood movie.

214
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.150
You don't know.
Oh my God,
look at this sunset.
Yeah,
I'd go out of my mind here.

215
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.970
Jesus Christ.
It's fucking unreal.
I mean,
have you,

216
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.970
have you run into a native American that it doesn't even know that they lost?

217
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.583
Right?

218
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.510
Like back in the day when those Japanese soldiers stayed on the fucking islands

219
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:17.770
and kept fighting,
World War Two is old faithful there.
Yellowstone.

220
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.950
Yellowstone is in fucking Wyoming.
I never knew that.

221
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.180
Ah,
man,
I wish they had the time.

222
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.720
I would drive all the way up there on the John d Rockefeller Jr memorial

223
00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:32.220
parkway.
I would go all the way up there.

224
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.130
Why I'm asking can be a fucking amazing state.
This is all like fucking like,

225
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.920
like the people that live there.

226
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.060
You've got the regular people that are from their generations,

227
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.780
generations of people that you know,

228
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.320
first went across the country and had the balls to pull up stakes from east

229
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:54.440
coast and go west and uh,
didn't have the balls to continue.

230
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.240
Like all those real men that settled in San Francisco and Los Angeles,

231
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.260
particularly Hollywood,

232
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.900
they stayed there.
Right.

233
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:11.530
And then what you have now is you have rich Fox and a rich Fox,

234
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:15.140
meaning just like business people.
And then,
uh,
celebrities.

235
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.250
Celebrities are big on going out there and buying someplace where they can just

236
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:20.900
get away and clear their head,
you know,

237
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.050
become a singer songwriter or wherever the fuck it is they want to do.

238
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.170
I'd like to do that Shit,
man.
I'd like to fucking run a log cabin out there.

239
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.320
But like one of those,
it looks like a log cabin from the outside,

240
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:37.370
but on the inside it looks like a house.
Right.
I get updated one,

241
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:38.960
not a real one with a dirt floor.
And you know,

242
00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:41.870
when some grizzly bear sticking his face through the fucking kitchen window,

243
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.170
like there is a kitchen that's just a fireplace,
right.

244
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.540
<v 4>Fuck all that.
You know what I mean?</v>

245
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.460
<v 3>I,
I,
you know,
something,</v>

246
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.420
this is what I always enjoyed most about fucking skiing cause this time of year,

247
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:59.450
I'm sure there's great skiing.
Uh,
even with global warming,
right?

248
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.270
Which we're not causing.
Evidently from the documentaries that I watched,

249
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.090
I didn't watch him.
I just saw the links and I was just like,
you know,

250
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:07.570
I'm too fucking busy.
I'm too busy.
I'm staying with the law,

251
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.780
I'm staying with my life,
you know.
Um,

252
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:17.180
but the thing that I liked most about skiing is after skiing and going down to

253
00:16:17.181 --> 00:16:20.060
the lodge and sitting by the fire and getting shit faced,
you know,

254
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.600
the whole skiing itself and worrying that I'm going to blow out my knee.

255
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.320
I fucking hate skiing,
man.
I respect the hell out of it.

256
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:30.290
I think it's an amazing workout.
But like a,
I should take a lesson.

257
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.660
I never took a lesson.
I was like,
I could skate right.

258
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:35.330
And I just started going down the blue square ones,
right.

259
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.130
Then of course you know your ego,
then it's black diamond,
double black diamond.

260
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.320
I don't wear a helmet.
It's really fucking dumb and I don't know how to fall.

261
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:45.230
And whenever I do,
one knee goes one way,
one goes the other way,

262
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.390
and it's just like,
you know what I should just do.

263
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.510
I should just buy all the ski ship Shit minus the fucking poles in the skis and

264
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:57.680
then just go do cardio like a fucking maniac for two hours.
Okay.

265
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.620
Then I put all the ski shit on our roll around in the snow,

266
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:03.380
and then I come walking into the large and just say,

267
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:07.250
I went down some quadruple black diamond.
I would like an IPA,
right?

268
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.700
And then I sit there,
a couple of snow bunnies come walking up,
right

269
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.640
little have she further and I'm in there.
Um,
but that's not going to happen.

270
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:18.500
I'm just going to go to Cheyenne and tell some shit jokes.

271
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:19.340
That's what's going to happen.

272
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.550
You're not sucks is I'm barely into that beautiful state.

273
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.650
Mark my words.
At some point I'm going to a,
I got to do a tour,

274
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.473
<v 4>uh,</v>

275
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.120
<v 3>you know,
of all I,
you know,
go from fucking Wyoming over to Nebraska,</v>

276
00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:40.740
up through the Dakotas,
through Montana,
down through fucking,
uh,
Idaho,

277
00:17:40.741 --> 00:17:42.990
back over to Yellowstone.
And then I'll fucking hit home.

278
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.060
I had to do one of those fucking runs.

279
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.173
<v 4>That'd be a fun one.</v>

280
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.920
<v 3>Cost a fucking fortunate gas.
It'd be fucking city.
There's like nine,
eight hours,</v>

281
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:54.450
nine hours drives between each of them.

282
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:57.300
I run into some comics that have done those runs out there and do that is not

283
00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:01.390
for the fucking faith of heart,
get tell you that right now.
But,
um,

284
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.960
I'm definitely gonna do that.
You know,
I'm psyched because I haven't,

285
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.740
I haven't been in Nebraska in a long fucking time.
I used to all of those things.

286
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.090
I was just watching better call Saul and when they were naming some of the

287
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:19.110
cities,
you know,
I was going like,
I fucking know those Hayes Grand junction.

288
00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:23.010
I bend to all of those.
That's on route 80.

289
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.120
Route 80 goes through Nebraska.
I'm sorry,
what the fuck am I talking about?
Let's,

290
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.140
let's back up here for a second.
Oh,
freckles flew yesterday and the helicopter,

291
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:34.390
I flew with my instructor by,

292
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:39.420
and we flew all the way up to Santa Barbara and came back and

293
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.370
was fucking incredible.
And I went along the coastline the whole way.

294
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.390
I was trying to get a,
uh,
a three point,
um,

295
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.350
I need the 3.4 on the Hobbs to have 100 hours.

296
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.510
Right.
And,
uh,

297
00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.990
ended up getting a 2.9 because we had a tail wind and I also took the coast back

298
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:04.620
rather than going along the one on one and down the four oh five who just was

299
00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:08.720
too beautiful to not do it.
And on the way back,
um,

300
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.340
you go over this,
uh,
navy airstrip,

301
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.120
which is restricted area,
but if,
you know,

302
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.040
if they don't have any planes come in and they let you fly over it.

303
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:21.510
So we were flying along the coast of it and they let us go in and they said,

304
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:21.781
you know,

305
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:24.240
and then they came back on the radio and they said they had a couple of planes

306
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.700
coming in to basically keep your eye out for it.

307
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.710
And of course my instructor finds him first and I look,
I go,
dude,
I only see one.

308
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:33.690
Where's the other one?
Where's the other one?
Where's the other one?
I'm like,

309
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:36.750
freaking out.
He goes,
no,
they're like fucking those FAA teens,

310
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:40.590
they fly like really close together.
And sure enough,
when they turned the corner,

311
00:19:40.591 --> 00:19:45.591
there was like two of them and they do this fucking sick ass approach that they

312
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:50.910
do is they come in right turn base and turn final.
And as they come in,
right,

313
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.170
one of them peels away.
Neither one of them lands on the first pass.

314
00:19:55.171 --> 00:19:56.490
They fly right over the warm way.

315
00:19:56.491 --> 00:20:01.491
One of them does a tight circle and the other does a bigger circle and then they

316
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:04.710
just fucking one lands in the other one comes in right in after him.

317
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.820
It's was fucking insane.
It was funny was the tower was going,
uh,

318
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.410
when Sierra hotel that keep uh,
traffic in sight and I'm like,
yeah,

319
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.230
keeping Traficant site wasn't Sierra hotel.
Then I'm like going like,

320
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.590
like I could do anything if that fucking thing was coming at me.

321
00:20:19.591 --> 00:20:24.420
Like this thing was like in like a,
like
not even like a Lamborghini.

322
00:20:24.421 --> 00:20:28.380
He's like in a Ferrari,
not a four.
I mean up to fucking Batmobile,
right.

323
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.300
Whatever.

324
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.420
It's more like one of those land speed fucking things they have out there in
the,

325
00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:36.000
uh,
the,
the Salt Lake,
whatever the fuck the salt flats,

326
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.590
the fucking salty dirt out there in Utah.
And I'm in this fucking,

327
00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:42.450
I was basically in a Chevy Chevette.

328
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.080
Like if it came at me like what was I going to do other than be like,

329
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.730
and then that would've been
what a way to go.

330
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.580
Um,
but when we were coming back down,
um,
we got to a point on the,

331
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.650
a lot of geography in this one.
We got along this point on the California coast,

332
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:06.610
which is called a,
I think,
I think dunes point.
I had never flown up there before.

333
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.800
And um,
there's a sick ass fucking house there,

334
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.690
right as you go up there.
It's got like a fucking,

335
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.500
a pool that's shaped like a fucking cutlass was like a sword.

336
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.560
And we will looking at that.
And is it,
as we came down a little bit further,
um,

337
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.660
we saw something splashing in the water and we looked down and it was a whale

338
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.210
coming up by breaching,
I believe is what you call it.

339
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:32.730
And we did a little loop around,
I got some video,
I'll put that up there.
Um,

340
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.170
it was fucking amazing.
And then there's just this point,
I think it,

341
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.880
maybe it's maybe that was further up and I think it was further up north.

342
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:41.200
Why don't we came around dunes point,

343
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.240
like all of a sudden you could start to see lax and then Santa Monica,

344
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.051
Culver City,

345
00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:49.870
and then downtown La was one of most beautiful flights that I've been on.

346
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.080
But the big thing was,
um,

347
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.550
I flew by lax and I made all the radio calls,
which is,
you know,

348
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.440
Bravo airspace as I've mentioned before.
And that's like the shit where,
um,

349
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.540
you need explicit permission to go into that airspace where they have to read

350
00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:11.500
your whole fucking tail number.
And,
uh,
I dunno.

351
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.380
It's like you feel like you're fucking talking to God when you talk to those

352
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:18.760
guys.
So I had rehearsed the radio call like fucking 30 times on the drive down.

353
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.081
And uh,

354
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:24.040
I was able to say it with enough confidence that he didn't sound too much like

355
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:28.810
an asshole.
And,
um,
and then let's go through and it was kind of anticlimactic.

356
00:22:28.811 --> 00:22:31.510
I had really built it up in my fucking head.
But anyway,
so I went back,

357
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:36.130
I got a 2.9,
so old freckle says 99.5,

358
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.440
um,
99.5 hours.
So,
uh,
I was supposed to fly today,

359
00:22:41.441 --> 00:22:44.290
but I was tired and I don't fuck around doing that shit.
I'm just like,
yeah,

360
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:48.340
I'm feeling tired.
I'm not feeling it.
Fuck it.
Um,

361
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.250
so anyways,
another thing that I was looking up his,
uh,

362
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.220
is beautiful as he states are,
you know,

363
00:22:54.221 --> 00:22:56.770
that I've been going to all of these states that people,
you know,

364
00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.550
consider flyover states and fucking what the fuck who's on there,
you know,

365
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:03.850
just shitting all over him even though they're absolutely gorgeous and there's

366
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:08.290
great people out there is um,
you know,

367
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:11.980
just to the drug use and that type of shit is really fucking bad at the heroin

368
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:14.650
man.
Everywhere I go is this fucking heroin problem.

369
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.180
And they keep linking it back to these,
uh,
you know,

370
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:21.820
people having an injury.
I saw this on real sports.

371
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:24.580
People have an injury and then they get like whatever they get the fucking,

372
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.870
was it percosets Vicodin.
I know what the fuck it is.
Oxy and that shit.

373
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:32.680
And then when that runs out,
they still want that high and heroin is cheaper.

374
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:37.300
And it's just like,
you know,
once again,
once again you would think,
you know,

375
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:40.900
with all this shit of talking about terrorism,
you know,

376
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:43.240
and people do and shit to this country for some reason,

377
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:47.000
you can fuck with the food supply and you can get your own countrymen addicted

378
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:51.080
to heroin.
And as long as you got enough fucking money,
nobody gives a shit.

379
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.000
It's completely flooded.
Isn't that like an act of terrorism?

380
00:23:55.001 --> 00:23:57.770
I out of my fucking mind.
How can you do that to fellow Americans?

381
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:00.230
You'll ruin in people's lives.
It's fucking brutal.

382
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.220
But it's one of the reasons why I stay out of the politics shit.
You know,

383
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:07.320
every once in a while I look at the stuff and it just,
I dunno,

384
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.270
it's like overwhelmingly depressing,
you know?
Like,
um,

385
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.600
I saw something the other day on a,

386
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.350
for some reason I was looking up Chelsea Clinton cause I saw her on TV with

387
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:20.030
Hillary and Hillary was giving a speech,
right?

388
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:23.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.910
<v 3>I,
and I was literally going like,</v>

390
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.080
there's no fucking way I can listen to that voice for four fucking years.

391
00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:36.370
I just can't,
I am not against a woman being president whatsoever,

392
00:24:36.371 --> 00:24:41.350
but you cannot sound like somebody's learning how to play a trumpet.
I just,

393
00:24:41.351 --> 00:24:44.740
I don't give us,
you could have all the answers to the fucking universe.

394
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.020
There's no,
he can't hear what she's saying.

395
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:49.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.280
<v 3>You know,
my dog's looking at me right now.
Like,
really?</v>

397
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:58.893
<v 4>MMM.</v>

398
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.730
<v 3>So anyways,
so I looked up and I was just going like,
how old is she now?</v>

399
00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:07.270
And when I started out in comedy,
she was just a kid.
And,
um,

400
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.270
<v 4>okay.</v>

401
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.511
<v 3>Yeah,
no,</v>

402
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:11.360
she was at that awkward age and it was kind of this nice unwritten rule United

403
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.550
and make fun of her wishing to the fucking awkward age.
Right.
I was thinking,

404
00:25:13.551 --> 00:25:17.690
what's she like?
12 or something like that.
And uh,
I went to go look it up.

405
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.550
You know how old she was?
Fine.
She was in her thirties,

406
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:23.780
which fucking blew my mind,
even though obviously it was 20 years ago.
Right.
But,

407
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.460
um,
but killed me is what I saw was they had a stat on our wedding.

408
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.640
Do you know her parents fucking through or a $3 billion wedding

409
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.650
like these politicians,
it's so fucking dishonest.
They don't even try to hide it.

410
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.700
It's like,
how the fuck could you afford a $3 million wedding?

411
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.000
<v 4>Okay.</v>

412
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.420
<v 3>The most money,
either one of you ever made it public service was,</v>

413
00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:50.950
was being president,
which was 400 grand of fucking year.
Dude,

414
00:25:50.951 --> 00:25:53.950
you make four to fucking grand a,
they're going to whack you in half.

415
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:55.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

416
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.430
<v 3>You going to maybe walk with 200</v>

417
00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:58.960
<v 4>okay.</v>

418
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.560
<v 3>Right.
Nowadays,
probably less than that.
Probably one 95 what a fucking,</v>

419
00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:06.340

422
00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.250

These conch go around,

423
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.130
All right.
Got Not a Hershey's kiss,

So you know,
I'm telling the truth.

424
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:23.603
<v 4>MMM.</v>

426
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.370

Just given speeches.

427
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.240
Can Imagine paid trainer granted,

429
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.310
<v 3>For a fucking hour now he got sick.
We Clinton</v>

430
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.050
<v 0>with that awful facelift that he got,
which just made his head look fucking huge,</v>

431
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.450
you know,
and he's lost all that weight and he got it.
You got to chin,

432
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.140
whatever the fuck he did do his chin.
He yanked at fucker back.

433
00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:02.730
He looked like a bobblehead version of himself.
And I'll tell you,

434
00:27:02.731 --> 00:27:06.630
his shit's Yank back.
So tidy.
Can't even clap anymore.
You know what I mean?

435
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:09.090
Either that or that's his true feelings about his wife.
Right.

436
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.010
Which you can't blame it.

437
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:15.050
You really can't blame Bill Clinton for going out and taking a cigar and,

438
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.340
and,
and putting it in that woman.
You know what I mean?

439
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.600
If like that's what he's laying next to in bed.
I mean,
I,
you know,

440
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.830
<v 3>Jesus Christ,
if,
if I was married to Hillary Clinton,
she would have to have,</v>

441
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.760
you know,
those,
those surgical mass,
that Asian people where when they get sick,

442
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:36.300
cause they don't wanna get anybody else sick cause they're fucking courteous or

443
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:40.560
because it's like nine zillion people that live next door get turned into an

444
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:42.420
epidemic.
I don't fucking know why they do it.
Right.

445
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.280
I would make her aware of one of those all the time because maybe then she'd

446
00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:48.570
sounded like a muted trumpet.

447
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.933
<v 0>Right.</v>

448
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.000
<v 3>And every once in a while she'd,</v>

449
00:27:52.001 --> 00:27:55.480
she'd hit a couple of notes that remind me of a miles Davis song and then maybe

450
00:27:55.481 --> 00:27:58.830
I could just stop myself from strangling her in the fucking Oval Office.

451
00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.693
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

452
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.440
<v 3>She reminds me like an animal that like is,
is getting eaten alive.
You know,</v>

453
00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:09.071
you've been here that like,

454
00:28:09.071 --> 00:28:13.390
just like time I saw that fucking monkey eaten that other monkey alive,

455
00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:17.950
just digging meat out of its back.
And these are like,
it's sort of like,

456
00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.190
not as sharp and not as quick as that.

457
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.850
<v 4>MMM hmm.</v>

458
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.680
<v 3>Anyways.
And they fucking that,</v>

459
00:28:24.681 --> 00:28:29.540
that Bernie Sanders guys with his fucking night Eo.
You look at and you know,

460
00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:34.220
you wonder why Bill Clinton got a fucking face lift and then you,
yeah,

461
00:28:34.221 --> 00:28:37.520
you're fucking,
he got his neck done.
Then you look at Bernie Sanders,
you're like,

462
00:28:37.521 --> 00:28:41.120
oh,
that's why Jesus Christ,
he looks like a fucking,

463
00:28:41.121 --> 00:28:44.000
he looks like a bloodhound eating a fucking Turkey dinner.

464
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.490
Jowls flopping all around February Joe.
Yeah.

465
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.430
<v 0>All right.
All of these guys,</v>

466
00:28:51.431 --> 00:28:56.410
that Jersey guy looks all fat and then everybody else just looks like an extra

467
00:28:56.411 --> 00:28:58.120
to me.
Granted,

468
00:28:58.121 --> 00:29:01.420
I have not listened to one fucking word.

469
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.850
Any of them have said,
but it's a,
it's going to be interesting.
Oh,
really?
Bill,

470
00:29:06.851 --> 00:29:08.020
you think it's going to be interesting,

471
00:29:08.021 --> 00:29:10.360
a presidential election that might Pique your interest.

472
00:29:10.361 --> 00:29:11.800
You have freckled arrogant country.

473
00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.380
<v 4>Um,
anyways,
so,</v>

474

<v 3>so what else?

I'll have fun with it.
And at the end of the day,

479
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.320

480
00:29:40.041 --> 00:29:42.310
fucking room,
matter how much I allude

481
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.070
<v 0>to,
that you could just sit back and be like,
well,

482
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.340
We won the Superbowl,

483
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.570

491
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:30.450
week.
Anyways,

Give the gift.

492
00:30:30.451 --> 00:30:34.620
Everyone is talking about.
Nobody is talking about this underwear.

493
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.580
Hey man,
did you hear about me undies?
No.

494
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.520

497
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.960
Sometimes something that says you deserve the best.

498
00:30:54.961 --> 00:30:59.310
Treat yourself and your boo.
Two a matching pair of me undies.

499
00:30:59.311 --> 00:31:04.290
Creamy the world's most comfortable underwear.
Please include the file Modo,

500
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:05.490
Modo mod out and the,

501
00:31:05.491 --> 00:31:09.330
and this underwear is coming is as comfy as it gets is coming.

502
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.620
Gross me undies are made of micro modal,

503
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:18.240
modal fabric,
meaning they're twice as soft as cotton.

504
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.180
You know what?
I'm sick of saying that.

505
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.160
I'm going to fucking look that up right now.

506
00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.160
Modal versus cotton bump up bump bar,

507
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:33.760
Dota,
Dota two to do to the bed.
Bed,
bed,
bed,
bed,

508
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.040
bed,
bed,
bed.

509
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.830
Clearly a little tonight and Botha.
Alberta is gone.

510
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.270
A men's underwear fabric types.

511
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.670
The ones considered artificial silk.
Oh,
it's artificial silk.

512
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:52.950
Holy Shit.
Wait a minute.

513
00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:57.270
Once considered an artificial silk silk,
it was once considered,

514
00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.840
considered an artificial silk.
Gross.
What the fuck is that?

515
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.870
Jesus Christ.
All of a sudden this ad cave down and it was a shredded dude.

516
00:32:05.871 --> 00:32:07.830
He looked like a diver.
I remember I was shredded.

517
00:32:07.831 --> 00:32:12.831
Greg Louganis was with these little skivvies on and his fucking package,

518
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.810
Jesus Christ.
They should have been a warning,
the package delivering on the way.

519
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:22.590
All right.
Once considered an artificial silk modal.

520
00:32:22.591 --> 00:32:27.591
Modal is a type of ray on what these to make slacks in the 70s that's softer

521
00:32:28.951 --> 00:32:33.450
than cotton and it's smooth and theft and breathes extremely well.

522
00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:36.210
They you go,
there you go.

523
00:32:36.211 --> 00:32:41.211
No more sweaty balls and extremely luxurious fabric.

524
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.790
My mistake,
excuse me,

525
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:49.510
it's cool to the touch absorbent grouse and similar in texture to silk or

526
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:52.820
cotton.
Unlike cotton,
however,

527
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:57.821
it is resistant to shrinkage and less likely to fade or pill.

528
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.810
Well,
Jesus Christ,
don't I owe everybody had fucking me undies and apology.

529
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:07.340
I'll never be a cunt again when I read this.
All right,

530
00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:11.090
the twice the softest cotton.
It's an artificial silk.
Okay,
I'll go with that.

531
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:15.590
Keeps you balls dry.
It's cool to the touch.
Uh,
and they don't just feel great,

532
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.870
feel great,
they look great to me.
Undies comes in,

533
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:21.590
tons of cool prince and styles and new designs come out every month.

534
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.340
That sounds like a lie.
Anytime they say tons,
give me a number.
Oh,

535
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:28.960
there's tons of got to right around the corner.
Just give me the money.
Uh,

536
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.750
you won't want to Miss February is limited edition designed from legendary

537
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:36.710
artists.
Keith haring.
Oh fuck he Harry.
What the fuck is Keith haring?

538
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:43.670
Hang on a second.
Keith.
The fuck is Keith haring.

539
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:46.130
He probably opens for Clinton when he fucking give speeches.

540
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.720
Can I have some over them?
Silky underwear for she sucked my dick.

541
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.230
Keith haring wasn't,
it was an American artist.

542
00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.820
This guy's fucking dead.
How the hell is he designed and underwear.

543
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:00.330
<v 5>Okay.</v>

544
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.520
<v 0>1958 to 1990</v>

545
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:07.500
he was 32 Jesus Christ.
He died young.

546
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.840
He was an American artists and social activists or of course he died.

547
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:15.600
Those are the fucking people that the government puts shit in.
Your coffee.

548
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:20.940
Who's work responded to the New York City street culture of the eighties concept

549
00:34:20.941 --> 00:34:23.790
of birth decks,
death,
sexuality in war.

550
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.400
Just she going to put this on underwear.

551
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.080
<v 5>Okay.</v>

552
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.520
<v 0>Oh yeah,
the stick figures.</v>

553
00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:31.940
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

554
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.570
<v 0>Oh yeah.
This guy had his own style.
I actually know what this guy's shit is.</v>

555
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.390
I've seen that before.
I don't get it.

556
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:41.210
I mean it looks like a fucking better version when I drew in kindergarten.

557
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.900
But then again,
a lot of modern art does it built.

558
00:34:43.901 --> 00:34:45.960
Why don't just read the fucking copy.
All right.

559
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.510
It's retro design is inspired by love making it the perfect Valentine's Day
gift.

602
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.063
Once again,

603
00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.160
Andrew Feminists is going to give you some cool music that I know nothing about,

as he does every single week.
Uh,
thank you guys for listening.

605
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.990
I hope you have a wonderful weekend.
You can't send Bronco fans.

606
00:37:31.991 --> 00:37:34.090
I'm just fucking with you.
Okay.
I don't give a shit.

607
00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:37.570
You think I'm not going to be on Roids when I'm,
you know,

608
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.090
I was going to say older.
I'm going to be 48 this year,

609
00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.770
so I should probably start taking it,
you know,

610
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.700
start showing up to gigs with no neck.
You know,

611
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.210
seeing if people fucking,
dude,

612
00:37:49.211 --> 00:37:51.490
you know what fucking Peyton Manning's neck and head look like.

613
00:37:51.491 --> 00:37:56.380
Do you remember when Steve Buschemi got stuck in that chipper in Fargo?

614
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.840
Do you remember when his leg was just sticking out with the foot?

615
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.850
That's what Peyton Manning's neck looks like.

616
00:38:00.851 --> 00:38:04.900
You just stick a head stick ahead on it.
Sorry,
I got the hiccups.
All right,

617
00:38:04.901 --> 00:38:06.370
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.

618
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.200
Enjoy the throwback podcast for the last half an hour in the wonderful music.

619
00:38:11.201 --> 00:38:13.120
I'll talk to you on Monday,
you cunts.

620
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.320
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

621
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.950
<v 6>Valentine's Day advice Billy by deer is billion.</v>

622
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.200
I know this is last minute.
I had a question about Valentine's Day.

623
00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:37.170
I am a single guy in my mid twenties rejoice.

624
00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:39.550
<v 2>Okay,</v>

625
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.050
<v 6>dude,
I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

626
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:47.250
if you're a single guy in your mid twenties and you live in America and you're

627
00:39:47.501 --> 00:39:49.690
living on your own,
please

628
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.690
drop to your knees and thank whatever gods you pray to everyday because you're

629
00:39:55.691 --> 00:39:57.250
never going to be freer in your life.

630
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.950
I know you've probably got student loans and blah,
blah,
blah,

631
00:39:59.951 --> 00:40:03.580
the stress and all that bullshit.
Fuck that.
Okay?

632
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.070
Getting never going to be freer in your life.

633
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.310
Go get three years supplies of condoms,
okay,

634
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.630
and bang away my friend.
Maybe you don't need to do it for three years.

635
00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:18.280
Maybe you're one of those guys for only three weeks,

636
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:21.760
but you need to get it out of your system.
All right?
He says,

637
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:25.610
I never really had a girlfriend for whatever reason.
Oh Jesus Christ.
All right,

638
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.180
we're going the whole other other way.
Truth be told,

639
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:32.140
my friends could name numerous reasons why I don't have a girlfriend,

640
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.230
but that's an entirely different issue.
What?

641
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:37.690
Jesus Christ as a fucking can of worms.

642
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:40.723
<v 2>They can.</v>

643
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.500
<v 6>You don't seem defensive or argumentative.</v>

644
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.860
So I don't know if it's an anger issue that,
look,
I'm so,

645
00:40:47.861 --> 00:40:50.050
I'm so sick of trying to be fucking Hannibal Lecter here.

646
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.710
Trying to guess what your shoes look like with w with the way you write,

647
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:58.090
you know.
All right.
I'm just gonna read the rest of this shit.
Uh,
as of right now,

648
00:40:58.091 --> 00:41:00.910
I am currently sleeping with three girls off.
Oh,

649
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:02.650
see you fucking have good knocking it out.

650
00:41:02.651 --> 00:41:07.060
I thought you'd like never had a girlfriend,
like in like never bagged anybody.

651
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:07.923
All right.
My fault.

652
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.853
<v 2>All right.</v>

653
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.440
<v 6>Do go fuck yourself.</v>

654
00:41:12.441 --> 00:41:15.850
You're a guy in your mid twenties and you fucking three girls right now and I'm

655
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:19.520
on this.
You need advice?
I keep doing what you're doing

656
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:25.250
anyways,
depending on what day of the week it is and how much I've drank.
Okay.

657
00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:28.280
That depends on how many girls he's banging a,
I've never lied to anything,

658
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:33.330
any of any of them about where our relationship going.

659
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.900
And although they never met each other,

660
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:41.330
each of them has an idea that I'm seeing other girls.
It's kind of a don't ask,

661
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:46.080
don't tell policy.
Um,
yeah,
dude and I,
you got to come with that.
You know,

662
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.580
you can open with that.
You know,
what are you doing?
I'm dating,

663
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:54.060
I'm playing the field.
Find people you date right now.

664
00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:58.080
A couple of people kind of see it just having a good time.
Well,

665
00:41:58.081 --> 00:42:00.800
I don't do stuff like that.
Well there's the door sweetheart.

666
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:02.830
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

667
00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.640
<v 6>Then they'll respect like that.
The honesty of that.
Some won't.</v>

668
00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:09.310
Some will actually have self esteem and walked out,
but a lot of them know,

669
00:42:09.311 --> 00:42:11.910
hang around.
Eventually they get tired,

670
00:42:11.911 --> 00:42:16.010
they're net gets weak and they'll fall right in your fucking Dick.
Um,

671
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:20.470
birthdays and Christmas are always a piece of cake because all that requires a

672
00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:24.640
quick text or a phone call or at the very most drinks at the bar.

673
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:26.200
But Valentine's Day is tricky.

674
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:30.010
Our dates consist of bar hopping and drunk sex.

675
00:42:30.011 --> 00:42:34.600
So flowers and a nice dinner would completely send the wrong message.
Dude,

676
00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:35.490
you selfish con.

677
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.310
Are you asking me how to keep banging these three chicks while getting through

678
00:42:39.311 --> 00:42:40.360
Valentine's Day?

679
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.680
Why don't you just look at the Valentine's Day like that's your pussy getting

680
00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.680
all star break.

681
00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.850
Just take three days off the day before the day after and the day of.

682
00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:50.110
<v 7>Okay.</v>

683
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:54.580
<v 6>Just say a,
what are you doing for Valentine's Day?
Um,</v>

684
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:59.110
uh,
I'm going to be a Jesus.
Where are you going to be?
I don't know.

685
00:42:59.111 --> 00:43:02.380
I don't have a good one for that one.
All right.
You know what?

686
00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:05.560
I just put myself in your shoes and I understand your problem now.
He said,

687
00:43:05.561 --> 00:43:06.670
I got to do a little bit of trouble.

688
00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:08.830
Last year one of the girls texted me and said,

689
00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.890
you know every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

690
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.040
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

691
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.170
<v 6>He said,
I knew my response couldn't be.
Yeah,</v>

692
00:43:16.171 --> 00:43:20.190
but if I get you flowers then I have to get flowers for all the other girls.

693
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:25.110
So I just post out and responded.
Yeah.
Well,
oh dude,

694
00:43:25.111 --> 00:43:26.460
you shouldn't respond to responded at all.

695
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.040
<v 7>Okay.</v>

696
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.980
<v 6>You know,
every girl likes to get flowers on Valentine's Day.
Isn't that funny?</v>

697
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:32.240
<v 7>Okay.</v>

698
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.540
<v 6>And that has nothing to do with most likely her having any sort of feelings</v>

699
00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:37.374
towards you.

700
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.710
It's just the bitch next to her in the other cubicle probably got some,

701
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.820
you know why the girl on her fucking whatever the fuck you want to call it.

702
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.270
Some guy broke my balls this week is fucking hilarious.

703
00:43:48.271 --> 00:43:52.110
It was trash and we say come off as a pompous ass because I always talk about

704
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:56.570
anybody who doesn't do comedy works in a cubicle,
you know?

705
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:59.900
And for some reason he decided to take that seriously and tell me that he

706
00:43:59.901 --> 00:44:03.560
actually works at the UN and travels all around the world.

707
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.540
If that's actually true.
Sarah,
how?
Why don't you just get on with doing that?

708
00:44:12.541 --> 00:44:15.420
You work at the UN and you travel all over the world.

709
00:44:15.421 --> 00:44:19.040
Why would you give a fuck what some absolute jackass is?

710
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.220
Say It on a fucking podcast.
How insecure are you?
Your insecurities?

711
00:44:23.221 --> 00:44:26.670
Probably a great thing because that's probably the thing that drove you to be at

712
00:44:26.671 --> 00:44:31.590
the UN.
What you travel all around the world.
You know sir,

713
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.440
good for you.
That's awesome.

714
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:39.500
I hope working at the UN and traveling all around the world fills you up some

715
00:44:40.021 --> 00:44:42.720
point where it fills you up high enough.
What?

716
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:46.590
You don't have to respond to a silly joke on some dumb ass podcast.

717
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.870
Um,
I travel all around the world.

718
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.090
Um,
you know what?
That's actually a great fucking job.

719
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.750
Do you feel like you get anything done?
You know,

720
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.320
do you sit there and wearing that headpiece next to that guy who's wearing the

721
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:08.250
water buffalo hat?
[inaudible] above doing that shit.

722
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.160
And you're sitting there trying to talk to him about how you can sell your rich

723
00:45:11.161 --> 00:45:12.330
crackers to their country.

724
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.500
Is that what you're doing when you're traveling all around the world?

725
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:19.260
I travel all around the world.

726
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.920
I can just see you on the plane with you fucking dress socks on.

727
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:32.640
You have a dash cunt.
Oh,
just sitting there.

728
00:45:32.641 --> 00:45:36.510
Or what movies am I going to watch on this flight as I travel all around the

729
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:39.690
world?
Um,
anyways.

730
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:42.860
You know something sir,
you had you,

731
00:45:42.861 --> 00:45:46.390
you had the James Bond job and then you fucking,
you played yourself.

732
00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:48.520
I don't know why you did that.
Why would you fucking,

733
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.460
that's like me responding to people on Twitter.
Why would I do it?

734
00:45:51.461 --> 00:45:55.120
I should pretend like I have better things to do.
Um,
anyways,

735
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:58.360
I want to keep seeing all these girls back to this guy,
but this,

736
00:45:58.361 --> 00:46:02.560
but at the same time,
I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's Day.

737
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.290
How to do you know what golf?
I did it.
I don't,
I'm just,

738
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.260
what is your problem here?

739
00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.150
<v 5>Okay,</v>

740
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.540
<v 6>dude.
Yeah,
you like a Gemini.
It's like you're this fucking lady killer.</v>

741
00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:15.120
Then also you kind of like,
you know,
you want to hurt anybody.

742
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:19.780
Should I get her some jam jams?
I can't even,

743
00:46:19.781 --> 00:46:23.150
I talk to the fucking UN guy.
What the hell was going on here again?

744
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:24.440
<v 5>Okay.</v>

745
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.320
<v 6>Valentine's Day got a little trouble last year.
Well,
listen,</v>

746
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.830
you're anticipating trouble.
Didn't you learn anything from last year?
You know,

747
00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:33.530
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

748
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.110
<v 5>Okay.</v>

749
00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.800
<v 6>Um,
what,
what would I write back?</v>

750
00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:42.850
I know what my response would be.

751
00:46:42.851 --> 00:46:45.640
The second I read that if it was just some girl I was banging and then they

752
00:46:45.641 --> 00:46:48.820
wrote that I would get this awful feeling in my stomach

753
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.500
and I would,
I would read it and as I got that awful feeling,
I'd go

754
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.050
and make that noise.

755
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:58.130
<v 5>Okay.</v>

756
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.791
<v 6>You know that thing,</v>

757
00:46:58.791 --> 00:47:01.310
like when you're just banging a girl and then all of a sudden she just fucking

758
00:47:01.311 --> 00:47:02.300
makes that comment.

759
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:03.980
<v 5>Okay.</v>

760
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:04.813
<v 6>You know,</v>

761
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.030
you think she's on the same page as you when she just makes that comment.

762
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.110
You know,

763
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.410
I was thinking about you today and you just feel that feeling in your stomach.

764
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:15.500
Oh yeah.
Well,
don't

765
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:23.240
fucking worst.
Uh,
you gotta be one and done,

766
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:24.440
but one had done is scary.

767
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:26.110
<v 5>Okay?</v>

768
00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:29.200
<v 6>You just gotta be honest.
I don't know if some girls,
what would I say?
You know,</v>

769
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:31.210
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day.

770
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.710
Um,
what would I text back?
Yeah.
You know,
that's what I heard.

771
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.620
You know what I mean?
You know what?
I shouldn't give you shit.

772
00:47:40.621 --> 00:47:43.170
I don't have a good response to that.
Well,

773
00:47:43.171 --> 00:47:45.720
maybe someday you'll meet a guy who wants to give you some,

774
00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.820
you want to get drunk and fuck.
Um,
yeah,

775
00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.570
I got nothing and you can't ignore it.

776
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:54.950
You know what I would've done?

777
00:47:54.951 --> 00:47:57.020
I would have ignored the text and I would have called her.

778
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:59.110
<v 7>Okay.</v>

779
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.230
<v 6>But a good three hours later,
three,
four hours,
three hours later,</v>

780
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:04.590
that's a good one.
You call her,
you ignore that text and they call it,

781
00:48:04.591 --> 00:48:08.500
she goes hell out.
And you're like,
Hey,
what's going on?

782
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.460
What are you doing tonight?
I got no plans Valentine's Day.
What are you doing?

783
00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:17.430
And he just started with that.
And then she,
well,

784
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.150
what do you want to do?
And she'll be seen.

785
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:22.750
If you're going to take it to some romantic,
you know,

786
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.640
direction you need,
don't you just keep it in the fuck buddy?
Well,

787
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.980
I figure we'd go down to a mean hammers,
whatever the fuck he call,

788
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.070
we'd go down to,
uh,
take it the face.

789
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:40.460
I have a couple pitchers of beer and see what happens.

790
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.820
Dude.
You know what?
You're,
you're,

791
00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.130
it seems to me you're not just fucking these girls.

792
00:48:47.131 --> 00:48:49.860
You're actually having like these many relationships with them.

793
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:55.580
You know,
the,
the key to have an a fuck buddy is,

794
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.630
is the time between fucking him.

795
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:04.670
And I don't give a shit how much a woman says that she can handle it.

796
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.400
Most of them can't.
Most of them can't.

797
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:11.360
If you fucking come on over there and you,
and it just,

798
00:49:11.361 --> 00:49:15.410
eventually they're going to get feelings.
They're more,

799
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.650
I dunno if they're more mature or if it's a defect.
It's just,

800
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:23.440
I just respect the fact that that's how they're wired.
So you,

801
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:27.440
if you have a fuck buddy,
okay,
let's,
let's just do the math.
Okay.
No,
no.

802
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:31.130
February is a very short month here.
So let's just say right out of the gate.

803
00:49:31.131 --> 00:49:33.020
You fucker on February 2nd

804
00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:34.750
<v 7>okay.</v>

805
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:38.600
<v 6>All right.
You shouldn't come around again till at least the 17th</v>

806
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:44.060
and progress.
You fuck.
And you leave f and l,

807
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.930
you fuck them and then you leave.
You don't bang her on the second.

808
00:49:47.931 --> 00:49:51.230
You Bang it on the second and then you bang her on the seventh year in a fucking

809
00:49:51.231 --> 00:49:54.300
relationship in their world.
You know,

810
00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.211
unless you,

811
00:49:57.211 --> 00:50:01.590
literally this second you have an orgasm as you're coming,

812
00:50:01.591 --> 00:50:04.920
you're scooping up your clothes and you walk out like half naked,

813
00:50:04.921 --> 00:50:08.670
then you just bizarre.
Just another good way to keep them at bay.

814
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.610
And why don't I just read the rest as to see what,
what his question is here.

815
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.040
He says,
I want to keep seeing all these girls,

816
00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.990
but at the same time I don't want to break.

817
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.540
I don't want any broken hearts on Valentine's date.
Yeah,

818
00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:21.990
you want to keep fucking all of them?
No.
Do what you have to have.

819
00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.430
You have to have a role evolving door.
You have to have a stable of women.

820
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.690
If you're going to live this life or you have to give into fucking rubbing one

821
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:31.790
out,
all right?

822
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.060
But you can't be a relationship guy with three different women cause you are

823
00:50:35.061 --> 00:50:37.910
going to end up hurting them.
So what you have to constantly be doing,

824
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.960
you gotta be like a college coach,
all right?

825
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:46.520
Every year you lose some top prospects,
but you're out there recruiting.
Okay.

826
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.770
See you.
So you maintain,
but it's never ending.
It's fucking exhausting.

827
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.590
But if that's the game you want to play,
that's what you have to do.

828
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.990
So that girl who says,
you know,

829
00:50:56.991 --> 00:51:01.880
every girl likes flowers on Valentine's Day right there,
you put on waivers,

830
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:07.040
okay,
for a fucking piece of ass to be named later you got,

831
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:13.040
he got to get rid of her.
Okay.
And you got to look,

832
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.630
go back and analyze what the fuck you did wrong that she felt it was okay for

833
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:21.350
her to text you cause you fucked up.
That right there shows that you fucked up,

834
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.160
that she felt that she could send that to you if you think you're just fucked

835
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:29.570
buddies.
All right?
So anyways,
he continues.
He says,

836
00:51:29.571 --> 00:51:32.840
I know that like it or not,
this shit is important to women.

837
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.610
If I take one girl out,
I'm playing favorites and setting a bad precedent.

838
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.260
Plus if she does that check in Shit on Facebook,
I'm completely fucked.

839
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:45.020
Yeah Dude,
you're doing dirt bags.
Shit.

840
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:49.970
If you're a single guy and something could happen that fucks you on Facebook,

841
00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.840
you're leading these girls on anyways.
He says,

842
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:56.510
if I take none of them out or do nothing,

843
00:51:56.511 --> 00:52:00.380
I have three irritable ladies on my hand.
Dude,

844
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:04.460
are you going to marry any of them now?
Well then let them go.

845
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.180
Why don't you have the balls to do that?
You know,

846
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.830
when a team halfway through the season,
just realize,

847
00:52:10.831 --> 00:52:14.330
do we ain't winning this shit?
Just pull a fucking Marlin's.

848
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.250
Just get rid of everybody

849
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.850
and then your fan base is your Dick and they're going to,

850
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.310
he's going to be pissed for awhile.

851
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:28.790
Um,
but then you build it back up again.

852
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:34.850
Build it back up again.
You know,
I dunno.

853
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.700
Look through it.
If you want to be in a fucking relationship,

854
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:40.550
you know there's other ways about going about it and doing this,

855
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:43.870
but you're trying to have your cake and eat it too.
Did you get you,

856
00:52:43.871 --> 00:52:46.730
you got the three women right now,
your bang in three different women.

857
00:52:46.731 --> 00:52:49.160
Where's your confidence?
You know what you're doing.

858
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:51.303
<v 4>All right,</v>

859
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:55.750
<v 6>dump to keep one at bay and then get two more.</v>

860
00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.310
Then dump the other one to get the other one.

861
00:52:58.311 --> 00:53:02.110
Just see if you don't even dump them.
You just phase them out,
phase them out.

862
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:05.620
But the new recruits that you get in,
you gotta be straight up honest with them,

863
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.660
you know,
unless you actually feel fails,
you feeling no feelings,
you know,

864
00:53:10.661 --> 00:53:15.310
don't keep coming back fucking him unless,
you know,
you get that 15 day,

865
00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:20.100
you fuck,
I'm on the second.
You fuck them on the 17th,

866
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.380
then you're into march and then banger on like the 11th.

867
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.760
<v 7>Okay.</v>

868
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:30.490
<v 6>All right.
And even then,
they can't catch feelings doing that.</v>

869
00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.800
But before you know it,
you know,

870
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.240
<v 7>okay,</v>

871
00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.170
<v 6>that's like 14,
15 days out of the year taken up.
Boy,
you,
well you got the bank.</v>

872
00:53:38.171 --> 00:53:39.730
Somebody,
this is such,
this is,

873
00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:42.910
this is really should be eye opening to women that I'm actually saying this is

874
00:53:42.911 --> 00:53:47.560
really a,
this is really awful that I'm speaking this out loud.
Um,

875
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.910
he says,
in a perfect world,

876
00:53:48.911 --> 00:53:52.960
I'll take all of them out at once and have the force and I've been chasing after

877
00:53:52.961 --> 00:53:55.540
my entire life,
but we don't always get what we want.

878
00:53:55.541 --> 00:53:59.320
Any advice from the lovely new would be much appreciated as well.

879
00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:01.840
Love the podcast.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Uh,

880
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.010
<v 2>yeah,
she probably wouldn't have been his,
uh,</v>

881
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:07.370
understanding as I was going to give you a lot of shit.

882
00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:29.643
Wow.

883
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:12.210
I've been asking some to write it.
And uh,
finally

884
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:16.570
<v 6>I haven't even read this yet,
but this already seems like gold.
This is,</v>

885
00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.600
this is the,
the
and the subject line of this email.

886
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.440
It says,
I think the guy I'm dating is a pussy.

887
00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:32.080
Hello Bill.
I am a 21 year old student.

888
00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:37.380
I began listening to your podcast recently and I heard you complaining about how

889
00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:42.130
women have not written in a while and being a woman myself decided to do so.

890
00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:45.130
It asks you for advice.
Well,
God bless you.
Uh,

891
00:55:45.131 --> 00:55:48.880
I live at home with my mom and go to college.
I recently found a very nice guy.

892
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.210
Uh,
there were college and was really into them,

893
00:55:52.211 --> 00:55:54.640
but then I started suspecting something strange.

894
00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.550
I started suspecting that maybe he was a pussy.

895
00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.240
At first I thought it was pretty harmless,

896
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:04.990
but then one night we had a house party and everyone was pretty drunk.

897
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:08.590
And a friend of mine who I haven't seen in a while was there.

898
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.610
And when everyone was way,
way,
way past drunk.

899
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:18.660
She tried to get into a fight with me and eventually pushed me down the wall,

900
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:23.320
then stole my iPhone and he was there and did nothing.

901
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.680
Jesus Christ.

902
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:30.520
I was so scared that I called my ex to come get me any did.

903
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:33.003
<v 8>Wow.</v>

904
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:37.720
<v 6>You think you're dating a pussy?</v>

905
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:42.370
I mean that right there g and he just stood there and let this other guy who

906
00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:45.310
used to hook up with you come in riding in on his white horse.

907
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:51.020
Anyways,
my ex was more of a man than the guy was dating now,

908
00:56:51.021 --> 00:56:53.150
even though the guy I'm dating was drunk,

909
00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:56.600
I felt like he should have protected me or done something,
anything.

910
00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:01.350
He did nothing and later he even confessed to me that he was scared of my drunk

911
00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:05.750
for friend and even scared of me.
What the fuck?
Right?

912
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.660
Even though he says this will never happen again.

913
00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:13.250
I have enough knowledge to know that people do do not usually change like that.

914
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:18.350
You know?
That's a really wise that you're really wise for your age of 21.

915
00:57:18.351 --> 00:57:22.550
If you,
if you were already not buying into the,
I'm going to change.

916
00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:27.740
That's a,
you're,
you're wise beyond your years.
You know,

917
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:29.960
they say that you're basically,

918
00:57:29.961 --> 00:57:32.570
your psychological makeup is done by the time you three.

919
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:37.130
So if you see some little toddler standing,
there was somebody taking his blocks,

920
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:42.050
that kid's going to be a pussy
anyway.

921
00:57:42.051 --> 00:57:46.550
So should I be upset or give him another chance?
Is this a deal breaker?

922
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:50.570
Is there no way to change a guy from a pussy to a real man?

923
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:54.110
Should I just break things off with him and if so,

924
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.040
should I remain friends with him?
Thanks bill.
And I hope you read this.
Uh,

925
00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:01.850
I love you India.
Oh,
that's nice.
Um,
all right.

926
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.130
This is the deal.
Uh,
you asking a question?

927
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.550
Is there no way to change a guy from a pussy to a real man?

928
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:12.330
<v 8>Okay.</v>

929
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:15.960
<v 6>No,
I don't think,
I think that that happens.</v>

930
00:58:15.961 --> 00:58:20.961
I think it happens way more in movies where somebody has a life changing moment.

931
00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:22.913
<v 8>Uh,</v>

932
00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:27.750
<v 6>and then they just decided I'm not going to take shit anymore.</v>

933
00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.400
But even then,

934
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:34.360
that just begins the journey of not being a pussy.
You don't just say,

935
00:58:34.361 --> 00:58:37.830
I'm not going to be a pussy and then Bam,
you're not a pussy anymore.
You have to,

936
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.040
you got to work your way up.

937
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:42.460
It's like if you were a hundred pounds overweight and you like this,
I'm done.

938
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:46.090
I'm not eating fucking ice cream anymore.
The next day you don't have a six pack,

939
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.680
you know,
it takes a fucking year or something.
You really got to turn it around.

940
00:58:50.681 --> 00:58:54.430
So,
um,
I dunno,

941
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.220
what are you looking for in a guy?
I mean,

942
00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:00.190
I think the fact that you're writing me and you're saying,

943
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:03.240
I think the guy I'm dating as a pussy,
I mean that,

944
00:59:03.241 --> 00:59:08.241
that actually hurts me on some level just because I insert myself into this

945
00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.480
story and the person I'm dating would be calling me a pussy or it could it be

946
00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:17.320
the ex,
I guess.
I Dunno.
This isn't about me.
This is about you come up,

947
00:59:17.321 --> 00:59:19.800
you'll stop being selfish.
Alright.
Um,

948
00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:22.340
I think you've totally lost respect for this guy.

949
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:24.380
And if you don't respect the person you're with,

950
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.230
eventually you're going to blow somebody else.

951
00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:28.430
<v 8>Okay.</v>

952
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.860
<v 6>You know,
if you don't break up with this guy,
that's what I'm predicting.</v>

953
00:59:30.861 --> 00:59:31.940
If you don't break up with this guy,

954
00:59:31.941 --> 00:59:34.880
you're just going to cheat on him just to facilitate.

955
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:36.230
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

956
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:38.660
<v 6>Getting out of the relationship because uh,</v>

957
00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:40.410
<v 8>okay.</v>

958
00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:43.890
<v 6>You know,
to get to that ll cool j moment,
we can just be fucking honest.</v>

959
00:59:43.891 --> 00:59:45.210
But I don't think you'll like that.

960
00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:49.020
I when something about you knowing that people don't change at your age and the

961
00:59:49.021 --> 00:59:52.590
fact that you like,
you know,
this guy's a pussy,
he's not sticking up for me.

962
00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:56.550
And the fact that he didn't stick up for you and then you took charge and say,

963
00:59:56.551 --> 00:59:59.160
well I'm going to fucking call somebody who will.

964
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.220
<v 8>Okay.</v>

965
01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:05.180
<v 6>I mean technically you should have fucked your ex boyfriend that night and he</v>

966
01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:07.210
and he shouldn't have been mad.
He should have been like any,

967
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.460
probably wouldn't have that cause he's a pussy.
I ain't,
I understand.
I mean,

968
01:00:10.461 --> 01:00:15.050
you know,
when you needed a big swinging Dick,
I mean,
God knows it wasn't me.
So,

969
01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:17.920
uh,
yeah.
Um,

970
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.490
I think if you don't break up with this guy,
you were actually fighting nature.

971
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:24.370
All right?
And

972
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:26.740
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

973
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.720
<v 6>you guys are wired to,
to,</v>

974
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:30.310
<v 8>okay,</v>

975
01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:35.310
<v 6>I know you guys aren't wired to just have kids with pussies.</v>

976
01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:39.850
You know what I mean?
You want a strong sun,
right?
You don't want like,

977
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:44.960
you know what that Pussy Dna and your kid,
right?
All that's going to kill you.

978
01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:49.730
Imagine that you have a kid with this guy and you want this kid to be like a,

979
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.930
like your ex boyfriend and it comes down and it's like this fucking little wormy

980
01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:56.650
worm guy.
Ah,
that'd be awful.

981
01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:00.680
Walking down the aisle to marry this guy with dead sheepish and you know,

982
01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:02.590
these deserve you again.
You know what dad,

983
01:01:02.591 --> 01:01:06.700
you want this guy to be the man standing down there and a white Tuxedo like

984
01:01:06.701 --> 01:01:10.780
fucking Roger Moore,
James Bond,
I think.
I think,
uh,
look,

985
01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:15.250
I don't know if this just happened and you're really upset.

986
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.340
So,
uh,
you know,
and like,

987
01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.430
and in three days you're not going to care and you get to go back to having a

988
01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:26.350
picnic with this guy because for all I know,
your ex who came coming back,

989
01:01:26.351 --> 01:01:28.330
maybe you broke up with him because he cheated on you.

990
01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:31.270
Maybe he was too much of a guy,
if you know what I mean.

991
01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:36.950
So then you said,
well,
all right,
I'm going to,

992
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.080
maybe I'm this next time I'm dating a nice guy.
He's now you dated a nice guy.

993
01:01:41.081 --> 01:01:43.210
The thing about is sometimes you date a nice guy.

994
01:01:43.211 --> 01:01:47.920
They can be so nice that they're pussies.
Alright,
and look,
I'm not,

995
01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:49.960
I'm not sitting there acting like,
you know,

996
01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.680
if I'm out with my girl in some fucking 200 pounds,

997
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:58.710
300 pounds jacked fucking 25 year old comes up and starts doing shit that I'm

998
01:01:59.771 --> 01:02:03.010
going to start swinging because I'm not,
I'm not,

999
01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:07.870
I'm not getting my fucking head kicked in just for the fuck of it now.

1000
01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.150
You know what I mean?
I mean,
it's not like just,

1001
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.960
<v 8>okay,</v>

1002
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.200
<v 6>you know,</v>

1003
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.390
straight across the board as a guy you have to fucking go and get your Goddamn

1004
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.740
head kicked in.
But this was a fucking woman.
This was a lady.

1005
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:24.990
I mean Jesus,
it's the,
it is a weird situation in defense of him were,

1006
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:28.380
yeah,
how do you get the fucking iPhone back?

1007
01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:31.260
You start wrestling with her and now you're kind of fucking throwing a girl

1008
01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:35.910
around so you're looking at that possible assault charge cause God knows that's

1009
01:02:35.911 --> 01:02:40.110
how the world worked.
Works right now.
Your honor.

1010
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:42.770
I was trying to steal a phone and he,

1011
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:47.100
this guy is salted me and you're going to be sitting there going,

1012
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:49.730
she was stealing a phone and then I can be able to get past your,

1013
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.480
you're a guy and she's a girl.
But um,

1014
01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.780
yeah,
he should have just,

1015
01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:01.040
he should've just held her by the back of her pants so she couldn't leave and

1016
01:03:01.041 --> 01:03:04.340
just stayed out of reach of her swinging.

1017
01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.880
That's what you do.
If you're in that situation as a guy,
he just reached out,

1018
01:03:10.881 --> 01:03:14.870
you grabbed by the back of their pants and you just start running in a circle

1019
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:19.160
until cops get there.
So they can't swing at you.
They're running backwards.

1020
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:20.180
I mean,
I don't know what you,

1021
01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:22.790
you gotta you got to fucking do something and he didn't do anything.

1022
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:24.740
That's the big thing that if you told them,
honestly,

1023
01:03:24.741 --> 01:03:27.910
if you told me that this was some giant guy who could kick the shit out of him,

1024
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:28.873
uh,

1025
01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:34.520
I wouldn't say that the guy's a pussy.
You know what I mean?

1026
01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.600
I mean,
what is the point of going in and getting a concussion?

1027
01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.030
Getting your tooth driven up through your fucking nose.

1028
01:03:40.031 --> 01:03:44.690
The guy's still going to leave with your phone.
You know,
that's that old,

1029
01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:47.830
uh,
Richard Pryor.
Bit Macho,
man.

1030
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.720
I'll take that knife and stick it up your ass macho man.
It's like,
no,

1031
01:03:50.721 --> 01:03:53.840
you're going to get the shit kicked out of you.
But this was a woman.
All right,

1032
01:03:53.841 --> 01:03:57.650
bill,
for fuck sakes.
Quit.
You have God damn rambling.
Wrap it up.
Um,

1033
01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:02.630
I think you know what you want to do when you should do it.
Um,

1034
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.510
you are dating a pussy.
The fact that when he was sober,

1035
01:04:06.511 --> 01:04:09.770
he said that he was scared of her and a view.
Uh,

1036
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.830
he seems like he's a little for collect and uh,

1037
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:18.210
I just can't imagine where it's going to be a stereotype.

1038
01:04:18.211 --> 01:04:22.500
But a guy like that actually putting it on you in the bedroom.
I really don't.

1039
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:26.310
He probably stares at you and the I,
am I hurting you?
Is Everything okay?
God,

1040
01:04:26.311 --> 01:04:28.680
you're so beautiful.
I mean,
come on right.

1041
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:32.730
Flip her over and wash your face in the pillows.
I'm always,
she says in ps,

1042
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:34.640
don't worry.
Uh,

1043
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.210
that I used to call a friend who pushed me and took my phone is no longer in my

1044
01:04:39.211 --> 01:04:43.770
life.
Did you get your phone back?
Well,
what happened with you guys?

1045
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.340
Now wait a minute.
What?
Like them?
Can I hear the followup here?

1046
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.700
There's so many different ways that this could be gone.
Was that like a girl?

1047
01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:55.701
Like when you thought that maybe you were a swing in another way and all of a

1048
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:57.830
sudden you broke up with her and

1049
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:47.820
I get them into the biggest,

1050
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:52.320
dumbest fucking fight last night with my girl,
right?

1051
01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:56.670
We had this great day,
everything's going great.

1052
01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:02.070
So I stay in,
I take a night off from comedy and I say,
Hey,
why don't we watch,

1053
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.980
why don't we watch a movie?
You know what I mean?

1054
01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.240
Cap Off this wonderful fucking day.
Everything's going great.
What could go wrong?

1055
01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:12.510
This is like the beginning of a horror movie where they just show like the

1056
01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:16.020
perfect family and everything's great and people are wearing like white linen,

1057
01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.600
you know?

1058
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.880
And then all of a sudden they just start showing the camera and the bushes like

1059
01:06:20.881 --> 01:06:25.470
a POV of like Mike Myers.
This is basically what happened.
So 60 minutes comes on,

1060
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.040
right?
Who doesn't want to watch that show and pretend they're smart?
You know,

1061
01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:34.240
I like it some more Morley safer comes on and you know,

1062
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:37.320
we smells like an old person.
Some old people don't smell like old people,

1063
01:06:37.321 --> 01:06:39.990
but he looks like he smells like an old person,
you know,

1064
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:46.050
smells of cigars,
ash trays,
you know,
a couple of wars,

1065
01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:48.270
maybe a date rape.
Um,

1066
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:55.020
so he's interviewing Meryl Streep,
all right.

1067
01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:57.980
The Great Meryl Streep,
and they're going through all oral,

1068
01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:01.650
oral frigging life and all the movies and all the different characters that

1069
01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:04.320
she's played.
Oh,
first of all,
they start,

1070
01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:09.240
they start the report off with Morley safer just sitting there,

1071
01:07:09.241 --> 01:07:13.760
right?
Smelling a fucking Ben Gay and Whiskey,
right.
And uh,

1072
01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:18.600
he says,
how,
you know how over in England,
you know,

1073
01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:23.180
they,
you know,
I dunno,
they make their,
their actors,
they,

1074
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.070
they award them by calling them lords and they night them.

1075
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.960
But over here in America,

1076
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:31.050
all we do is just give them the shiny statue and it's just like,

1077
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:34.920
starts off right off the bat for some reason,
just shitting on America.

1078
01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:40.380
I don't know why.
Like an Oscar is somehow beneath

1079
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.110
sir,
uh,
Anthony Michael Hall.
I mean,
or,
or Lord,

1080
01:07:46.111 --> 01:07:51.060
what it Lord of what,
what are what lease.

1081
01:07:51.061 --> 01:07:55.200
You can fucking hold our statue,
your Lord.
Of what kingdom,

1082
01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.330
that phony horse shit that you have with Prince Charles and the popper or

1083
01:08:00.331 --> 01:08:03.210
whatever the fuck is going on over there,
you know,

1084
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:08.640
look up the Rothschild's night,
you over there,
then that fucking means something.

1085
01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.560
Then you can come become part of their yacht.

1086
01:08:10.561 --> 01:08:14.130
Convoy is they go around the world figuring out how to take over another

1087
01:08:14.131 --> 01:08:18.710
currency,
right?
Then you're in with them.
Okay.
But if you're,
if you're fucking,

1088
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:23.630
you know,
Lord of this and your,
your wing man is the Duke of Elton John.

1089
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:26.660
I mean,
that's a whole thing is fucking stupid,
right?
So right off the bat,

1090
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:30.280
it's already bugging me,
but I know near hates when I talk to the TV,
right?
So I,

1091
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.213
you know,

1092
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:35.990
I keep my big fucking Yap shut and they started talking about Meryl Streep Up,

1093
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:37.460
up,
up a bog on through the whole thing.

1094
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:41.780
And then I'm the old guy there smelling of a,
you know,

1095
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:46.370
prescription meds goes,
uh,
you know,
whenever they talk about the roles you play,

1096
01:08:46.371 --> 01:08:50.090
they always say,
you know,
he played independent minded women,
very strong women.

1097
01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.600
And Merrill goes,
I know that's,
yeah,
that's what they say.
You know,
when a guy,

1098
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.550
they never say to a guy,
oh,
you're playing a strong willed character,
Yadda Yadda,

1099
01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.520
Yadda.
I let that go.
Whatever,
no biggie.
I'll take that.

1100
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:06.440
It's probably true.
The fuck do I know I'm not a Horman.
Right.

1101
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.880
But then they show her after she played Margaret Thatcher,

1102
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:15.170
and she's given a speech to a bunch of women's young girls and she's trying to

1103
01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:16.250
inspire them and she,

1104
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:20.690
she takes a quote from Margaret Thatcher who was something along the lines of,

1105
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:22.730
if you want a bunch of people to talk around,

1106
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.630
talk standing around talking about doing something,
you know,

1107
01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.230
something,
I go,
you got to talk to men.

1108
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:34.520
But if you want it to actually get done,
you got to get a woman.

1109
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:37.790
And then all the chicks go,
Woo.
Like flipping out.
Right.

1110
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:41.570
So I laughed and I'm like,
Yay.
Reverse sexism.
Right.

1111
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:47.210
Just seeing,
you know,
my,
my whole fucking theory,

1112
01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:48.950
how everybody is just a piece of shit.

1113
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.490
You just don't have the power to act out what the fuck you want to do because

1114
01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:56.060
that,
that right there,
if you flip that around as a guy,

1115
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:59.720
if you're running for president,
it's fucking over.
He can't be like,

1116
01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:01.250
let me tell you.
I'll tell you what,

1117
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:05.810
after I get you jobs and after I fixed this economy,
okay?

1118
01:10:05.811 --> 01:10:08.210
And I'm the man to do it because I'll tell you right now,

1119
01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.370
if you're looking for someone to stand around and talk about doing something,

1120
01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.610
you get a woman.
You want to get it done.
You got to get a man.

1121
01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:19.130
Here are my nuts right here on the podium.
Vote for me.

1122
01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:21.680
November 4th go fuck yourself.
Right?
You did that.

1123
01:10:21.681 --> 01:10:25.040
Your presidential campaigns over.
She does it.

1124
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:29.900
It's fucking adorable and it's just as fucking ignorant.
You know what I mean?

1125
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:34.100
What a fuck do you get off saying that we stand around and do nothing.

1126
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:38.150
Meryl Streep.
Ah,
or quoting Margaret and youtube.
Margaret Thatcher.

1127
01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.300
Let me tell you,
you bitches something.
Alright,
we faked a fucking lunar landing.

1128
01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:50.090
Okay?
You think that's just talking.
Anybody can land on the fucking moon.

1129
01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:50.900
That's easy.

1130
01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:55.700
But to pretend you did it all right and get everybody to shut the fuck up about

1131
01:10:55.701 --> 01:10:59.030
it.
That,
that,
that,
that right there,
that takes skill.
So whatever.

1132
01:10:59.031 --> 01:11:02.990
So I make that little comment and um,
did I just go with that?
That,
that,
that,

1133
01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:05.600
that,
that's the only fucking porky pig.
So,

1134
01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.330
so I make that comment and like,
you know,

1135
01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.150
I've been with Nia long enough that I can tell by the side of her face when

1136
01:11:11.151 --> 01:11:12.680
she's just thinking about like,

1137
01:11:12.681 --> 01:11:15.930
what if I grabbed everything I really cared about and walked out of this house

1138
01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:20.040
right now?
She got like that fucking mad at me,

1139
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.863
you know?

1140
01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:23.210
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1141
01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:24.530
<v 6>And I'm like,
she's just like,</v>

1142
01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:30.230
right after the story was obviously just shut the fucking thing off and uh,

1143
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:35.150
I won't happen next sale.
I'm walking to seven 11 and get some ice cream.

1144
01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:38.480
I haven't,
I've not even,
what happened was all going great.

1145
01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.180
You know,
am I be asshole there?
What am I?

1146
01:11:43.181 --> 01:11:47.270
Am I supposed to just fucking sit there with my mouth hanging open with drool

1147
01:11:47.271 --> 01:11:49.970
coming out when I watch TV?
If somebody says something Douchey,

1148
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.590
I'm not supposed to say it.
Yeah,
whatever,
whatever.

1149
01:11:54.591 --> 01:11:57.800
So I just finally just said,
you know what?
Fuck this.
I take the dog out.

1150
01:11:57.830 --> 01:12:02.600
I go around the block.
What do I do?
I'm calling my guy friends,
right?

1151
01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.170
They're all backing me up.
I'm not saying who I called.
I don't name names.

1152
01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.240
All right.
And they're all laughing their ass off and they 100% agree with me,

1153
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.830
which is all I'm looking for at this point.

1154
01:12:12.831 --> 01:12:14.420
I just want people to say that I'm right.

1155
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:18.200
I don't want to learn anything from this experience.
Just tell me I was right.

1156
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:22.160
So it can be an ignorant ass again.
I don't know.

1157
01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:24.410
Why don't you guys weigh in on that?
Am I a Dick for saying that?

1158
01:12:24.411 --> 01:12:28.850
Should I just let that one go?
You know?
Uh,
you know what she said?

1159
01:12:28.851 --> 01:12:31.400
That fucking drove me up the wall.
She goes,
why are you

1160
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:33.710
<v 8>okay?</v>

1161
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:35.030
<v 6>She didn't say intimidated.</v>

1162
01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.150
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1163
01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:38.320
<v 6>She's one of those words.</v>

1164
01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:40.540
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1165
01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:45.230
<v 6>Why are you threatened by what she said?
It's like I'm not threatened.</v>

1166
01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.400
I,
yeah,
Jesus Christ.
Then I take the bait,
you know,

1167
01:12:49.401 --> 01:12:53.030
it just sends me right over there like threatened about what?
Oh my God.

1168
01:12:53.031 --> 01:12:57.140
This person that I don't know who has never called me,
nor will ever call me,

1169
01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:00.470
who has no effect on my life.
How do you get threatened by that?

1170
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:03.570
I'm just calling it for the bullshit that is,
cause you know what?

1171
01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:05.450
This is what fucking drives me nuts.

1172
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:10.460
I can't stand when somebody tells me that they're shit sandwich tastes worse

1173
01:13:10.461 --> 01:13:14.600
than my shit sandwich.
Okay,
go fuck yourself.

1174
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:19.280
At what point am I supposed to have empathy as I'm sitting here eating the shit

1175
01:13:19.281 --> 01:13:23.120
sandwich and you're telling me how much worse yours,
yours,
this,
you know,

1176
01:13:23.121 --> 01:13:27.240
at the end of the fucking day.
You know what I mean?
Sure.
Mine might be on a,

1177
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:28.850
you know,
a better slice of bread,

1178
01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.270
which I guess would make it taste a little bit better,

1179
01:13:32.271 --> 01:13:35.330
but at the end of the fucking day,
right?
The end of the fucking day.

1180
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.370
All right,
I'm going to end up in a FEMA camp with you.
Okay.

1181
01:13:40.371 --> 01:13:45.020
You think when the next fucking a psycho comes along,
I'm going to make the cut.

1182
01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:49.880
What the fuck do I,
what do I bring to the world?
Huh?
Exactly.

1183
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.650
I'll be standing right next to you.
So go fuck yourself.
You just fucking woman.

1184
01:13:54.651 --> 01:13:57.470
Every time she sneezes,
they give her another God damn award.

1185
01:13:57.471 --> 01:14:01.250
She's still pitching.
Still fucking bitching.
You know it's rich.

1186
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.590
I remember when I did this Oscar nominated part.

1187
01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.250
Oh go fuck yourself with your wigs.
The thing just,
you know,

1188
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:10.760
that's what fucking pisses me off when I watched this shit.

1189
01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:14.620
If you want to know my perspective is from where I come from,

1190
01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:17.650
I can't bitch about shit cause everybody's like,
oh go fuck yourself.

1191
01:14:17.651 --> 01:14:20.530
You hit the lottery.
Right?
But I got to sit here and listen to you bitch.

1192
01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.040
Even if you fucking killing it,
even if you killing it,

1193
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.950
you know Yale School of drama and he's still up on the bull.

1194
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:34.540
Go Fuck yourself with your God damn yachts.
Alright,

1195
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:38.770
there you go.
That felt good.
It's probably ignoring or whatever.

1196
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:07.670
<v 2>Y'All know.</v>
