1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.980
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.770
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And I

3
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.500
<v 0>checking in on you.
What's go oh,
I got my microphone back.</v>

4
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.570
He's back from Europe baby.
He's back from Europe.

5
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:29.430
I got mine,
I got my fucking microphone there.

6
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.660
Um,
I'm fucking wound up cause I'm jetlagged uh,

7
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.491
first of all,

8
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:39.930
a lot of people sent me tweets were making sure I was okay cause I was in Italy,

9
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.360
um,
where they had that horrible earthquake unfortunately.
And uh,
devastating.

10
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
Um,
I actually had flown out like 12 hours before that,

11
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.830
but I was down on the Amalfi coast.
So I don't think I would've felt at any ways,

12
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.850
but uh,
you know,
whenever I,
it nothing happened to me.

13
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.750
So that pales in comparison to what happened to everybody else who is in the

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.790
vicinity of it.
So,
um,
fucking brutal.
You know,
it was crazy.
It was,

15
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.480
I looked it up to see when it happened and there was like a website that has all

16
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:12.300
the earthquakes,
like every day,
like every day there's like,

17
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:16.470
I forget some ridiculous number.
It was either like 30 or 700.
Either way,

18
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.630
it was impressive.
The amount of fucking earthquake sit there are.
And um,

19
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.380
you know,

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
<v 1>it just goes to show you that just things are just always moving and changing.</v>

21
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.553
Um,

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.160
I'm half in the bag right now and I don't mean Boosie cause all fucking Billy

23
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.993
Boothbay is clean.

24
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.260
He's going clean until his special.
Um,
I'm taking my special in Nashville,

25
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.410
by the way,
at the Ryman theater doing two shows,

26
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.020
October 21st is a few tickets still left.

27
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.990
If you'd like to go there and say I was there when he did the thing about his

28
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:55.230
fucking balls during the thing there with the fucking shit.
You know,

29
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.440
you could say that you were there,
uh,
or you could just say it anyways.

30
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.310
You could see no one ever says,
you know,
produce a ticket stub.

31
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.250
When you really think about it.
He say,
yeah,
it was fucking there.
What stock?

32
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.810
I was there,
JFK.
I was on the grassy knoll.

33
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.130
Oh yeah.
There was other people there.
I had declined to answer that question.

34
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.330
I smelt.
I definitely smelled gun gunshots and my ears were ringing,

35
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.040
but I'm going to stop short of saying that it took place on the grassy knoll.

36
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.670
<v 0>Um,
yeah,</v>

37
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:29.110
so I am totally fucking jet lagged and uh,

38
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.870
I've been doing a radio tour to promote all these dates.

39
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:36.871

<v 0>Getting ready to do that.</v>

42
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.310
I'm doing the makeup date finally from the Snowden days of Long Island.

43
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.960
That's going to be September 7th.

44
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:52.370
And I don't know where the fuck I go from there,

45
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:57.371
but I know I had down south going down south the man and I'm woke my wife today

46
00:02:59.381 --> 00:02:59.980
cause I was doing the

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.980
<v 1>fucking radio bubba.
The love sponge was,</v>

48
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:04.990
I think it was the first one that I did and that woke her up.

49
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.280
She's looking at me like,
Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?
I'm like,

50
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.850
go back to sleep.
That's not what I said.
I said,
oh,
I'm sorry honey.

51
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.640
Did I wake you?
She goes,
yes.
And she goes,

52
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.470
can you make me some waffles with Turkey Bacon?
And I said yes.
Okay.
You know why?

53
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.170
Cause that's how you shut these broads up.
You know what I mean?

54
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.060
You just go in the way.
What do you want?
What do you want?

55
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.450
Something with fucking sugar on it to keep your fucking menstrual flow and

56
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.120
fucking cycle.
Whatever the fuck goes on down there.
Okay.

57
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.360
That's not my part of it.
Okay.
I'm like the race car driver.

58
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.000
I don't know how to build the fucking engine when I can get that fucker around

59
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.930
the track.
I don't even know what that means.

60
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.920
Um,
so anyways,
I was making the waffles and of course all you know,

61
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.950
she likes Turkey Bacon,
which evidently you can't stick in the oven.

62
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.040
I don't like Turkey Bacon.
It doesn't taste as good as pork bacon.

63
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.990
And you don't know when it's done when his Turkey banking.
All right.

64
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.660
So,
uh,
the pan was dirty.

65
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:03.160
So I'm fucking in the middle of this radio tour and I'm fucking making,
I dunno.

66
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.560
Somehow I was at the sink,

67
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.680
I was fucking jet lag and the Greg Kid band jeopardy pops in my fucking head and

68
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.500
now I got it downloaded.
Right?
And next thing you know,

69
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:19.120
I'm fucking doing dishes like six 30 in the morning,
right?

70
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.280
Got My pajama bottoms on fucking headphones.

71
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.570
Just cracking.
Right.

72
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:30.571
Where were you when I need you all to something.

73
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.080

Anyway,

76
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.910
<v 1>it's so hard to be all alone.</v>

77
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.680
I know you're something.
Yeah.
Oh,

78
00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:58.550
Right?
And then of course she's back up,
so you still waking me up.
It's like,

79
00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:00.070

You know what I mean?
With the farms.

80
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.130

81
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:06.320

Is that what you're telling me?

82
00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:10.530
You're telling me that it's six 31 in the morning,

90
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:37.380
I don't know how to lead singers do it.
Like I would get stuck in my head like,

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:42.300

95
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.010

96
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 0>drives people fucking nuts.
I don't have fucking time cause I got shit to do.</v>

97
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.660
All right,
so as mentioned when I was under,

98
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.490
for some reason I'm pointing at myself in the fucking mirror cause I'm trying
to,

99
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.520
I'm trying to keep the fucking energy going.
I got neither,

100
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.880

Then I'm done with this shit home.

102

Holy fucking shit.

103
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.730
Good look.
Imagine a snow man.

105
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:31.670
I got to talk to myself in the mirror.

109
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:47.160
fucking human big.

110
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.530

That's how it's done.
That is fat shaming one on one.</v>

111
00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:56.010
You do it to yourself.
Okay.
The Becky head,
you know,

112
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.281
You know,

113
00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.250
tonight you're going to give yourself a couple of Oreo cookies as a reward and

114
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:03.660
the gate immediately after two bites,
at least 27 minutes of cardio,
you know,

115
00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:07.560
you're doing that.
Why wouldn't you do that?
Um,

116
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.000
so I came back to the good old us of a,
had a little contraband,

117
00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:16.310
if you know what I mean.
I ain't talking drugs,

Talking about,
you know,
uh,

118
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.510
the fucking cigar habit got me again when I was over there.

119
00:07:18.511 --> 00:07:22.050
Those mother fuckers in a casino,
you know,
uh,
you know,
you know,

120
00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:24.060
you go to fucking duty free and next thing you know,

121
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:28.530
you're down the street buying a human door and there it sits there it sits

122
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.380
laughing at me.
Oh,
shiny.
Oh God.
Damn you bill.

123
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.640
You're such a weak son of a bitch.
Um,

124
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.660
but when I got home aside from a month of male,

125
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.580
when I ordered two books,
when I was over there and I was excited,

126
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.301
one of them or not,

127
00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.880
it's going to kill me because this guy is such an underrated drummer.

128
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.080
Like I've never even heard the proper pronunciation of his name.

129
00:07:55.081 --> 00:07:57.450
So I forgive me if I fuck this.

130
00:07:57.451 --> 00:07:59.820
I'm going to fuck it up cause I'm gonna say it two different ways.
Modal,

131
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.830
modal Motel.
You see the,
the Billy Squier drummer.
Is it Bobby?

132
00:08:04.831 --> 00:08:09.810
Is it chew in ARD or shoe or not?
I don't know what blood,

And I'm reading through that and uh,

135
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.470
it's just a fucking great story and a killer drummer and a,

136
00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:25.170
it's just,
you know,

137
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.080
It's got all this killer fucking Ludwig drum kits.

138
00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:30.360
It's got all these interviews with all these guys,

139
00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:32.850

141
00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:36.511
played.

142
00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:40.620
I remember back in the day when I'd be listening to WBCN the rocket Boston,

143
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.450
they'd be like,
oh,
go check out fucking so and so down at the channel are red,

144
00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:49.350
the Tam or the Middle East or tavern,
the paradise and all that Shit.

145
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.393
And I remember thinking,
yeah,

146
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.280
what it never,
but you don't dreams die and a,

147
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.770
you get older and you learn to accept things that,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

148
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:03.360
the simple things in life,
you know,

149
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.170
a little bit of apple cider as she watched the sun going down on your nine year

150
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.410
old Prius.
You know,
those things,
you'll learn to appreciate those things.

151
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.360
You know,
you're like,
you know what,
it'll,

152
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.360
there's a lot of people out there that that day they,
they,

153
00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:16.740
they would kill to have that dream,
you know,
not in this country.

154
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.100
It's kind of hard when the people you're surrounded with that's not their dream.

155
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:22.710
That's kind of hard when they're laughing at that dream sharp,

156
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.880
that gets difficult.

157
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:27.600
But if you could somehow transport that nine year old Prius to some of the

158
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:28.800
poorest parts on earth,

159
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:32.670
why they would look at you like a king and that's what you have to hold on to.

160
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.340
Um,
I'm just encouraging my way through this fucking thing.

161
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:41.080
So then I went on this fucking,
this,
this,

162
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.900
this whole thing on WBC WBCN.

163
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.060
Like I'm fucking looking up every article I could find.

164
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.390
I ended up watching the last broadcast of,
of WBCN.

165
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:56.850
I didn't know it came out in 1968 I was born in 68 and for the first 41 years of

166
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.720
my life,
that fucking radio station was on the air.
You know,

167
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.140
they helped out Aerosmith,
they helped up all these fucking bands.
David Bowie,

168
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:05.950
all these guys,
they all these pictures,
Frank Zap,

169
00:10:05.951 --> 00:10:08.550
all these guys come to the station and I was like,

170
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:11.820
I need to know more about this shit.
Next thing you know,
I'm buying a book on it.

171
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.520
See,
I used to be in a,
I used to be in trucking.
I didn't drive a truck.

172
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.760
I unloaded the truck.
That's what I did.
I used to work in warehousing.

173
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.740
I liked warehousing.
Why?

174
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.840
Because I didn't have a desk and there was a giant square footage area.

175
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:32.190
Then if long,
as long as I was within it,
I was considered doing my job.

176
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:36.480
There wasn't somebody breathing down my fucking throat.
You know,
my neck,

177
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:39.210
I should say my throat.
I was weighed down.
My fucking neck is,

178
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.330
I'm supposed to be doing the spreadsheets,
so whatever it is,

179
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.570
those fucking poor people who sit in cubicles.
Do you ever just,

180
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:46.550
you and me just see,
you have just,

181
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.270
it would just walk by that maze of fucking cubicles.
You know?

182
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.570
If I was,
if I worked in there every Halloween you'd have to dress,

183
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.580
dress up like Jack Nicholson in the shining and just Olympia way through all of

184
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.770
them with an ax go and work

185
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.300
like fake icicles on your nose.
He couldn't do that.

186
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.730
Some somebody would blow a rape whistle or they would,

187
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:19.140
they would somehow feel it was sexist because how come a woman couldn't dress
up?

188
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.670
Why was he chasing a woman?
You know,

189
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:24.530
all the fun of it would be immediately taken away by human race.

190
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:29.010
One fucking one little fucking little to,
to,
to,
to call the human resources,

191
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:33.970
you know,
it would just all go away.
The whole thing would go away.

192
00:11:33.971 --> 00:11:34.541
And then what?

193
00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:39.541
You'd go right back to the soul crushing silent islands of 148 adults sitting in

194
00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:47.380
a maze of cubicles wondering,
pray,

195
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.800
oh B for Sunday.

196
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:54.940
Their dream to come walking through that door and get them the fuck out of that

197
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:58.440
opposite but until then continue on with his spreadsheets.

198
00:11:58.441 --> 00:12:01.150
So I used to work out in the yard,
used to work out in the warehouse,

199
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:06.070
unloading of trucks,
you know,
ups driver.
The Fedex driver,
you know,

200
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:07.450
half those guys would show up.

201
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:11.740
They gave themselves their own tattoos for whatever fucking reason.
All of them,

202
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.790
every fucking one of them had something in common was that they didn't want to

203
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:20.260
work for somebody else,

204
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:24.580
but they were too dumb to start their own fucking business.
So what do you do?

205
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:29.210
You get into trucking.
I work for you buddy,

206
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.080
but you ain't going to see me for days.
You understand?
You don't know.

207
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.870
Am I at this crackle bear,
the Myopia there,

208
00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:40.780
the days am I on a side of the fucking highway poured shop?

209
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:44.240
You got no fucking idea.
And as long as I bring that truck,

210
00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:48.240
load a cute tips in by Thursday,
9:00 AM I'm getting paid.
Don't be,

211
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:51.530
it don't matter what the fuck I did for the last three fucking days.

212
00:12:51.531 --> 00:12:55.400
And I always relate it to those guys.
I saw it.
There was,
there was a freedom,

213
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.790
yet you had stability.
Okay,
I'm getting a check every fucking week,

214
00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:01.880
but I don't get some breathing down my neck unless you work for ups.

215
00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:05.210
UPS was a motherfucker.
They always had that fucking ride along.
Douche,

216
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.640
the ice cube of ups.
Right.

217
00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:10.850
And then you will though the Kevin Hart character driving the fucking thing as

218
00:13:10.851 --> 00:13:13.880
he was reading you the riot act.
Well,
I guess in those movies,

219
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.400
Ice Cube always drives,
but you know what I mean,
the hard ass.

220
00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:19.360
And then you were like the,
uh,
the,
the,

221
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:22.850
the chicken police academy don't move dirt bag right here with a fucking scared

222
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:26.120
person when they would come along and they write you up every time.

223
00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:29.780
You didn't fucking put on your blinker,
you fucking Blanka right.

224
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.840
If you took the turn too sharp and all of that bullshit.
So anyway,

225
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:38.310
so I went down this fucking rabbit hole and I ended up buying this book on a

226
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.270
WBCN that's just coming out of him.
So when,
oh,
I knew it was gonna say,

227
00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:43.940
so when I used to fucking work brain is all over the place.

228
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.390
When I used to work in the warehouse,
I,
um,

229
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.030
<v 6>yeah,</v>

230
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.530
<v 0>I used to fucking let we still listen to that every fucking day.
Cha Lockwood,</v>

231
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:57.250
Dara,
the big mattress.
And then the lunchtime song,

232
00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.210
you know,

233
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.720
would come on and they'll be like whatever the fucking hits where that day where

234
00:14:02.721 --> 00:14:07.721
they would just put lunch in it and then mock Parenteau would come on at 3:00 PM

235
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.630
and then you knew it was almost the end of the fucking day.

236
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:13.170
And he was like the coolest guy.
He was like the rock star,

237
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:18.070
the whole fucking thing.
And I know he had some extra curricular activities.

238
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.450
I'm talking about the man on the air,

239
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.780
man on the air was a fucking rock star for three to six.

240
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:27.850
It was the fucking greatest cause he was the coolest guy.

241
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:31.510
And then you knew that the day was almost fucking over right.

242
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.510
And you knew those guys were all doing fucking blow and they would drink.

243
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:37.530
It been made you filled the hour I do is drink.
He's,

244
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.870
you guys are doing blow at work.
Why can't I get drunk on the forklift?

245
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.330
They had that sort of influence on people in Boston dom kit.
They actually want,

246
00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:46.490
I was watching.
Um,

247
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.540
<v 6>okay.</v>

248
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.640
<v 0>I think Bradley j was the guy who did the last,</v>

249
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.840
I watched so many of them and was fucking jet lag.

250
00:14:51.841 --> 00:14:56.570
I think he did the last shift on WBCN and they were talking about all the,

251
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:57.950
all the bands that they broke,

252
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:02.170
all this stuff that they did and they would say in all the fun,
all the fun,
um,

253
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.200
<v 6>okay.</v>

254
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.200
<v 0>Stuff they did for charity and they started talking about how WBCN had their own</v>

255
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:12.740
softball team called the BCN ball busters.
And I was immediately like,

256
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:17.030
no fucking way.
I went to one of those events and they go,
yeah,

257
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:21.170
one time we played this one band,
but blah,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.
And then then,

258
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.630
because there was another time we played this band and I was,

259
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.090
and they said Huey Lewis and the news and I was like,

260
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:30.430
I was at that screaming at my computer in Italy going,

261
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.620
I fucking went to that.
Right.
And they were like,
yeah,
where did we,

262
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.620
we did that and like fucking marble head.
And I was like,

263
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.500
I was screaming at the computer like they could hear me.
I was like,
no.

264
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:43.730
Is it Nickerson field in fucking a and at Boston University,

265
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.320
I believe,
when they still had a football program and I went to that,

266
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.930
I remember Huey Lewis pitched,
I remember that Bass player,

267
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.430
he showed up dressed like he was going on stage.

268
00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:58.910
He had a long leather coat and he had like the number four and then like tape on

269
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:02.270
the back of his coat.
He had his cigarette go and he was fucking hilarious.

270
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.720
And everybody was rooting for Huey Lewis and the news,

271
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:10.250
except for me and my buddy.
And we will heckle in them.
You know,
everybody,

272
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:12.080
you know,
it was wrong for them cause they were the rock stars.

273
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.410
They weren't rooting for the fucking home tab.
Right.

274
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.730
Bunch of fucking Dick Writers.
So we was sitting there and we had a couple,

275
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.583
two or three.

276
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:21.560
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

277
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.850
<v 0>you got it right.
But he's staring at his,</v>

278
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:31.700
um,
so anyway,
so I bought a book on that and,
um,
and that's it.

279
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.800
And I think,
I don't think I have anything else to fucking say.

280
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:37.190
And I still got 14 minutes left.
So this is,
this is where it becomes a quagmire.

281
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.820
Um,
oh,
I didn't mention I did.
Uh,

282
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.780
I did finally see the fucking UFC two oh two.

283
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.150
Holy Shit.
Was that worth the money?

284
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.060
I don't give a fuck if the next three UFC,
well,

285
00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:54.690
I'd give a shit three if the next to stink.
I don't give a fuck.

286
00:16:54.691 --> 00:16:58.590
That's how good tool too was.
That was,
that was just a,
and then of course,

287
00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:02.370
I don't know the names and I don't know shit about fighting.
You know?

288
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.540
I got to admit,
even when,
like when I watch,
like I'll watch,
uh,
uh,

289
00:17:06.541 --> 00:17:08.280
what's his face stare the Burger King Guy.

290
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.290
Why do I always forget his fucking name?

291
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:16.400
Conor McGregor.
There you go.
Like when he's,
when he's like,

292
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.990
what?
He's fucking doing his press conferences,

293
00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:22.150
which is just an amazing performance.

294
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.490
I don't even know what the fuck he's talking about.
Okay.

295
00:17:24.491 --> 00:17:28.420
I don't know what a fucking triangle is,
you know,
under hooks.

296
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.320
I don't know what any of that shit is.
I just fucking,
I just did.

297
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.340
It's the baddest fucking job you could possibly have.

298
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.820
What do you do for a living?
I fall can kick somebody fucking ass.

299
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.100
Fucking walking in there and like,

300
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.940
like gets the 18 hundreds bare chested just walking in and beating the fuck out.

301
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:49.120
It's the greatest thing ever.
But I've got to admit when they get all technical,

302
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.220
don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
You know?
So when he,

303
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.150
no matter what he's saying,
I don't hear what he's saying cause I don't get,

304
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.930
I don't,
I don't know anything about fighting.
You know what I mean?

305
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.700
So all I hear is I got a fucking shiny,
that's all I hear.

306
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.100
That's all what he talks.
I don't give a fuck what he's saying.

307
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:08.010
That's how I got a fucking shiny stood in that pair of shoes.
The market.

308
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.440
<v 1>I got it all fucking fucking shiny.</v>

309
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.160
So it's been a fucking pair of shoes to match all of them.

310
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.290
I'll put my fucking shiny shoes up on the fucking table.
Right?
That's all I hear.

311
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.620
You're going to do nothing.

312
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.120
<v 0>You screaming and yelling and shit.
Throwing water bottles.</v>

313
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.710
It's fucking tremendous.

314
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:32.990
No idea what they're talking about and ideas reminds me of every fucking dude I

315
00:18:32.991 --> 00:18:35.360
ever had detention with and went to summer school with.
Right.

316
00:18:35.361 --> 00:18:39.170
That fucking dude who just,
he wouldn't crack.
Even if he knew you did it,

317
00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:41.960
he wouldn't say shit.
Right.
So you,
I'm like it both of them.

318
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:47.120
So I finally sit down.
Right.
I got a fucking shiny,

319
00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:48.570
so I've down the street,
they stairs,

320
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.150
that fucking guy with a fucking shiny pair of shoes.
Shoes on.
Um,

321
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.330
I don't know why.
That's what I focused on probably cause I don't,
I don't know.

322
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.970
I haven't had a fight since like fucking seventh grade and I,
and I,

323
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.100
I was going to say,
and I lost as I recall.

324
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.570
Like you forget getting your ass kicked.
Um,
oh God.

325
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:10.470
It took a bad one.
You know when you lose so bad you can,
you can feel your hair

326
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.500
and so much my fucking head was on fire.

327
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.250
Like I could almost like close my eyes and mentally count the fucking hair

328
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:22.260
follicles.
That's how bad I lost that fight.

329
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:27.200
Holy Shit on my fucking does it.
My left here on my right here,

330
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.750
one of them was like so fucking hot and it was just ringing.

331
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.470
<v 6>Ah,</v>

332
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.860
<v 0>you never thought like your shirt could hurt you until you got into like a
fight.</v>

333
00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:40.970
Remember that somehow you fucking color your shirt would leave like these liquid

334
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.970
ligature marks on your neck.
They kind of,
that happened.

335
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.430
Um,
Jesus fucking Christ that,
that was a good one for the other person,

336
00:19:51.431 --> 00:19:56.120
not for me then that was the end of my fucking fighting.
Correct.
Um,
oh,

337
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.230
I had a bad fight in Korea.
You know,
I fucking,
uh,

338
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.270
I lost to a girl when I was in the third grade.
She was in fifth grade though.

339
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.350
Now,
and I tell you something,
that was a big deal.
Okay.

340
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:07.910
And if Conor McGregor can keep talking about how he went up a couple of way

341
00:20:07.911 --> 00:20:12.330
classes,
then I could make a fucking excuse that this,
she was in fifth grade.

342
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.240
All right.
She had me buy like,
I don't know,
six inches and above she,
she was,

343
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:20.241
if she was a big girl and I was trying to get the attention of for her sister

344
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.010
who was in the third grade and she had,

345
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:27.690
she taken the kickball from me and I playfully went up there to take it back

346
00:20:27.691 --> 00:20:30.090
from her.
But I grew up,
well I had was brothers,

347
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:32.940
so I didn't know how to fucking interact with females.

348
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:36.240
So I took it away the way I would take off my little brother I fuck and ripped

349
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:40.950
it away and she was near the school and me ripping it away caused her to careen

350
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:41.671
into the school,

351
00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:45.630
which we all know are made out of bricks because of the three little pigs story.

352
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:48.490
Right?
So it's made out of fucking bricks and she hit her head on it.

353
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.420
It started to cry and I was,
and I was like,
and I didn't know what to do.
Shit.

354
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:53.530
My wife cried last week.

355
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:56.410
I didn't know what to do then you think I know what to do 40 fucking years ago

356
00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.900
<v 1>I didn't.
Right.</v>

357
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.310
So she starts fucking crying and Outta nowhere.

358
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.820
Cause the third grade is in the fifth grade,
has had the same fucking recess.

359
00:21:05.821 --> 00:21:09.690
She came out of fucking nowhere.
She got him on a fucking no APP.

360
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:11.800
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

361
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.310
<v 1>And uh,
just proceeded to just fight.
I can't really remember what it was.</v>

362
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.800
It was just,
it was,
I just remember it was coming from above.

363
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.130
I don't know exactly what she hit me with.
It was fist,

364
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:23.350
but I don't know if they would hammer fists.
I don't know what,

365
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:26.560
but she fucking kill him.
And I,
and the only kills me is I held it together.

366
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.100
I fucking held it together afterwards.
You know where you want to cry,

367
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:33.130
but you're like,
I'm not going to cry.
You're trying to walk upright,
you know,

368
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:34.360
with your head's a little cocked.

369
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:38.120
And I was trying to just fucking walk away and um,

370
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.270
I was,

371
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.860
I was all good and I got about five feet away and then this other girl goes,

372
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.460
she shouldn't have done that to you.
And then I fucking bursted out crying.

373
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.950
<v 0>Oh,
it was a long,
sad,</v>

374
00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.760
sorted fucking tales of my flights.
Um,

375
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.220
but doing it had a lot of high.
Did you bill?
You cried after a woman beat you up,

376
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.660
you know what I mean?
Anyways,
um,
she wasn't a woman,
she was a child and so was I,

377
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.860
you know,
when I look back at it,

378
00:22:12.861 --> 00:22:16.480
if I could fucking just had a little more head movement and I went for a single

379
00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:19.900
leg takedown,
you know what I mean?
I think I could have had her,
but you know,

380
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:22.630
that shit was not mainstream back then.
So,
uh,
you know,

381
00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:25.510
I didn't get the underhooks going and there was no way to get the triangle go in

382
00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:30.100
with the,
uh,
the figure four leg lock.
So I lost that one there.
Um,
so anyways,

383
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:33.670
I watched the whole fucking fight night,
uh,
UFC two oh two,

384
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.650
I got a fucking,

385
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.620
I got a fucking pocket square for each one of my fucking suits.

386
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.533
Um,

387
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.760
<v 6>yeah.</v>

388
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.710
<v 0>Okay.
There was some guy dress like a cowboy.</v>

389
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:51.590
I remember that he came down like he looked like he was from the outback.

390
00:22:51.591 --> 00:22:53.060
Like the second you saw this guy,
you were like,

391
00:22:53.061 --> 00:22:56.840
this guy just does not give a fuck.
And He,
he fought a guy.

392
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.580
This is why I have such a respect for fighters.

393
00:22:58.581 --> 00:23:02.810
He fights this fucking kid who started off as a wrestler in college.

394
00:23:02.811 --> 00:23:05.360
He lost his first 17 matches.

395
00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:06.700
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

396
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.533
<v 0>You know.</v>

397
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.860
<v 6>Okay.</v>

398
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.900
<v 0>Jesus.
I would have been crying after three.</v>

399
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.120
This dude lost 17 in a row is a freshmen and stuck with it.

400
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.650
By the time he was like a senior,

401
00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:21.530
he was like some finalists and some national thing.
It's fucking of these,
these,

402
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.790
I'm telling you,
it's fucking amazing,
right.
I'm trying to think of like a,

403
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.800
a more fat ass fucking sport and the only thing I can come up with is that

404
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:35.500
fucking tt race in the Isle of man where those guys ride like 200 miles an hour

405
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:40.450
through the fucking woods on Ninjas and shit.
Like every,
like three,
four years.

406
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:42.940
Like somebody dies.
It's fucking,
I'm,

407
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:45.950
but like somebody died like 2014 the the guy hit a house.

408
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.100
<v 6>Okay.</v>

409
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.140
<v 0>Just don't like fucking,
I don't know how,
I don't know how fast he was going,</v>

410
00:23:49.141 --> 00:23:52.290
but he went up over a hill and landed on his front wheel and he was going right

411
00:23:52.291 --> 00:23:56.230
to the fucking house and then that was it over.
Um,

412
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.200
and there's a bunch of people standing there.

413
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:59.160
<v 6>Okay.</v>

414
00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.940
<v 0>It's incredible.
So I saw that.
I was just like,
Jesus,
Dennis,</v>

415
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.940
I tell jokes for 11,
that's like kind of pathetic when you,

416
00:24:05.941 --> 00:24:09.270
when you look at it now.
Anyways,
so this fucking,
this cowboy dude comes in,
right?

417
00:24:09.271 --> 00:24:12.450
He fights his kid who just has no quit in them.
Right.

418
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.540
He lost his first 17 matches and now he's in the fucking UFC.

419
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.963
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

420
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.160
<v 0>And he fucking beat this kid.</v>

421
00:24:18.161 --> 00:24:20.840
Like it was one of the sickest anybody who was like,
Ooh,

422
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.530
look books and better than UFC.
You got to see the way knocked this guy out.

423
00:24:23.531 --> 00:24:27.670
If you can't appreciate
you fucking jabs him in the face.

424
00:24:27.671 --> 00:24:29.830
And in the moment when he closes his eyes,

425
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:34.750
this guy fucking drops down two floors,
like a fucking cat,
you know,

426
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.930
and then punches him in his stomach.
And the dude's like,
what the fuck?

427
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.940
He leans to the right.
That guy throws this fucking Kaaba guy,
throws a left talk,

428
00:24:42.941 --> 00:24:46.360
and as his fucking head goes over to the right,
he fucking boots I'm in the face.

429
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.970
It was like matrix level fighting,
except it was fucking real unbelievable.

430
00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.420
Um,
I couldn't be the fucking fifth grade girl.
I mean,
it's just,

431
00:24:56.421 --> 00:24:59.990
it's so humbling to watch one of these events.
So then the next fight,

432
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.660
this guy who just goes by rumble,
right?

433
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.680
<v 6>Okay.</v>

434
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.431
<v 0>He's standing there,</v>

435
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:08.840
this giant shredded black dude and he's just sort of adjusting the gloves as he

436
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:10.880
was standing there.
It was so intimidating.

437
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:14.060
I just started laughing and without even thinking,
I just laughed and said,

438
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:16.880
what the fuck do you do with that?
And uh,

439
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.150
according to the one fight I've seen him fight,
evidently nothing.

440
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.520
This guy fucking,
he redefined the right there.
Fred.

441
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.620
He fucking came out.
The other guys doing a little,
yeah.

442
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.583
<v 7>Ooh.</v>

443
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.080
<v 0>Couple of fucking little,
I don't know what the fuck.
Ain't know what he did.</v>

444
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:36.460
<v 6>Okay.</v>

445
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.550
<v 0>It was a couple of little,
a little,
little fucking little,</v>

446
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.280
I don't know what the fuck he call them.
Little flurries back and forth,

447
00:25:42.281 --> 00:25:43.780
and then he kind of just reached out,

448
00:25:43.781 --> 00:25:47.110
grabbed the guy by the back of his head or his shoulder and said like,
hey,

449
00:25:47.111 --> 00:25:50.500
you know,
I,
I want to talk to you for a second.
Like,
uh,

450
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:56.430
what's his face in fucking Beverly hills cop when he kills Eddie Murphy's friend

451
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.550
Jonathan Bags,
Jonathan Banks.
Remember when eg grabs it going,

452
00:26:05.551 --> 00:26:09.480
like he just puts his arm around him like,
hey man,
do you ever,
I mean,

453
00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:11.280
have I fucked up?
I'm sorry.
And he just fucking,

454
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.250
he gives them to buy and they the fuck in here.
That's what he did with this guy.

455
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.110
He just fucking,
he's just sort of reached out,

456
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:21.170
grabbed them and then just this fucking uppercut fucking plan over fucking over

457
00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.630
the right there.
Fred,
you know,
what's a great thing?

458
00:26:24.631 --> 00:26:28.380
If you still have it recorded,
you got to see Bruce buffer his face.

459
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.210
It's the fucking greatest reaction ever.
He's sitting on this side.

460
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.600
That's what I like about it.
When you watched the knockouts in slow motion,

461
00:26:37.601 --> 00:26:40.680
you can sometimes see Rogan or somebody just the,

462
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.340
their jaws down like on the floor.
Just,

463
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.630
it's one of the sick knockouts I've ever seen.
And then,
uh,

464
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.260
I dunno,
I know there's a couple of hours.
I was pretty fucking jet lag.

465
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:56.940
And then of course I woke up.
Conor McGregor comes out,
right?
Nate Diaz,

466
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.870
and I'm not going to lie to you,
I was rooting for Nate.
All right.

467
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.150
I like nick.
You know what I mean?

468
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:07.020
But I also knew when he went in there that there was the only fucking way he was

469
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:08.970
gonna win that fight was if he knocked him out.

470
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.340
T K O got him to tap a choked him out.

471
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:13.410
That's the only fucking way for cause at the end of the day,

472
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:17.880
it's a fucking business.
It's a fucking business.
Okay.

473
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.720
And nobody makes them money like Conor McGregor when he comes fung,
I got off,

474
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:23.680
fuck it.
Pair of shoes that batch every pocket.

475
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.820
So when he starts fucking going off and all the money's got coming in there

476
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:30.000
looking like 1 million bucks and they'll knows fucking Irish guys.
So

477
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.130
that's the sound of fucking billions of dollars.

478
00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:37.350
Just raining down on the UFC.
You got an,

479
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.060
you got to knock the guy out or it's fucking over.
So the fucking fight stock,

480
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.960
he starts kicking Nate and the fucking leg,
every one of those.

481
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:50.130
I was just going that with that I would quit.
I would quit again.
I would,
I would,

482
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.780
I would write an apology to his entire family for stepping into the fucking,

483
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:55.950
and Nate's just,
you know,

484
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.610
taking you in the back of his fucking leg is getting bruised up.

485
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.700
It's fucking brutal.
Just the sound of it,
right?

486
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.250
Anybody else have an older brother and he just laid on the couch and you're

487
00:28:05.251 --> 00:28:09.120
watching a deputy dog or some shit.
He just comes over and just punches you.

488
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.440
He's not a pro.
He's just your asshole older brother.

489
00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:15.840
And he punches you in the side of the leg there.
Well,
that was it.

490
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:16.890
Your Day was over.

491
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.790
This guy's taking a professional foot to the fucking leg like 50 times.

492
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:22.540
It seemed in the first round anyways,

493
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.750
he got like knocked down like one or two times at first round.

494
00:28:24.751 --> 00:28:29.010
So obviously he loses that one all right there it gets not down in the second

495
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:29.844
round.

496
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:35.050
And this is how I saw the fight and this is somebody who is not ever had a

497
00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:39.450
professional fight and lost his last amateur bout in the seventh grade and got

498
00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.800
beat up by a girl in the third grade.

499
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:43.830
So you know that you have to take what I'm saying.
Seriously.

500
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.260
I thought from the second half.

501
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.750
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

502
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.250
<v 0>Of the uh,
second round,</v>

503
00:28:49.251 --> 00:28:52.610
halfway through the second round is most people say to the end of the fight.

504
00:28:52.611 --> 00:28:56.480
I mean,
I thought he pretty much,
Nate pretty much

505
00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.360
won the fight.
You know,
it's,

506
00:29:01.361 --> 00:29:04.600
the problem was he got knocked down the first half of the second round,

507
00:29:04.601 --> 00:29:08.170
so you're going to lose that round.
All right.
But he definitely won round three.

508
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.440
I thought he went round forward.

509
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.280
I thought halfway from round forward to the end of round five.

510
00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.900
Conor McGregor was going for like this country stroll and kept looking at the

511
00:29:16.901 --> 00:29:21.130
fucking clock and his mouth was hanging open and Nate just kept coming.
I mean,

512
00:29:21.131 --> 00:29:22.060
one point he would like,

513
00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.330
he was walking away for like the 10th time and Nate's like giving him the finger

514
00:29:25.331 --> 00:29:30.160
and shit.
Like,
what the fuck are you going?
Um,
but I don't know,

515
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.220
the end of the day Nate was bleeding like a fucking civ.

516
00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.160
I think a lot of that's just because he's got all that scar tissue and shit.

517
00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:38.860
He always sends a bleeding.
But the fucking guys like a maniac.

518
00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.700
The more he bleeds,
the more you find,
the more you,
you can't kill it.
He starts,

519
00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:47.380
he moves forward.
He just keeps going forward.
So I dunno,

520
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.430
I would've been surprised beyond,
even though it was for Nate,

521
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.840
if they actually said Nate won the fight,

522
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:55.030
I would've been shocked if they gave it to him.
Um,

523
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.950
because he did get knocked down three times.

524
00:29:56.951 --> 00:30:00.580
And also Conor McGregor makes them all that fucking money.
And,

525
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.630
but when they gave it to con or else it didn't feel right,
you know,
and,

526
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.480
and you know something kind of talk shit afterwards he goes,
surprise,
surprise,

527
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.080
the fucking king is back or some shit.
It's like now,
now,

528
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:15.100
now you looked a little nervous when they went to the judges.

529
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.010
You did not look confident.
What's so fucking ever so don't,

530
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:22.270
don't fucking do that shit now.
So unbelievable fucking fight.

531
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.830
This is something he knows nothing about.
Funny.

532
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:25.420
But I know when I see an unbelievable fight,

533
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:30.410
so thank you to both of them and I can't wait for the fucking third one.
Um,

534
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:30.911
you know it's funny,

535
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:34.800
I watched the whole thing when my wife was like sleeping and shit
and she like,

536
00:30:34.801 --> 00:30:39.150
she was so,
I was so,
I couldn't really like yelling shit.
And um,

537
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:40.840
<v 6>okay.</v>

538
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.180
<v 0>I remember laughing my ass off so many fucking times.</v>

539
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:47.290
It was so many funny moments in that like when they were waiting for the
decision

540
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.890
and you said,
you said Nate goes,
it goes,
I won that Shit,
mother fuckers.

541
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:55.540
<v 7>Okay.</v>

542
00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.640
<v 0>Fucking guys the best.
Right.</v>

543
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.390
And then I like when when the rumble guy won and he said,
hey,

544
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:04.540
I want to fight you next.
And they cut to the champion,
right?

545
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:07.540
And everybody bows them and they do the whole thing on ice champion everything.

546
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:11.890
And when I first saw him,
I was like,
is that Rondell Sheridan?

547
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.770
Did he make it as a comedian and get bored?
And now he's dominating the,

548
00:31:16.771 --> 00:31:20.320
the fucking UFC.
They went on him so quickly and then they cut back.
Oh,

549
00:31:20.321 --> 00:31:22.900
that's not Rondell Sheridan.
And um,

550
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:24.330
<v 6>okay.</v>

551
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.610
<v 0>And when I saw the guy who was the champion,
of course,</v>

552
00:31:26.611 --> 00:31:28.080
I don't know his fucking name either.

553
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.590
What was hilarious to me is I found like the one disadvantage of having a black

554
00:31:34.381 --> 00:31:37.950
belt in mixed martial arts is you're so good at fighting.

555
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.640
Everyone around you is too scared to say your button.
Too many buttons up.

556
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.760
I don't know.
It's like the guy never wore fucking izod before.
It's like,
dude,

557
00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:48.630
what are you doing?

558
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:53.630
I never seen that many buttons on a Polo shirt and this son of a bitch,
he fuck,

559
00:31:53.631 --> 00:31:58.350
he been the bomb.
You know,
that's how he got his black belt.
He didn't quit it.

560
00:31:58.351 --> 00:32:01.190
The fucking yellow belt.
This guy kept going and you know what he,

561
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.360
he applied the same things that he learned.
What?

562
00:32:03.361 --> 00:32:06.300
He went up the martial arts ladder with those buttons.
He goes,

563
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:08.760
I'm not stopping at the ground floor.
I'm taking this to the end.

564
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.060
How many buttons are there?
I'm going to fucking button all of them.

565
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.170
God dammit he did it.

566
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:14.620
<v 6>Okay.</v>

567
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.660
<v 0>All right.
I think I'm done with this whole fucking thing here.</v>

568
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.710
Pet peeves of the UFC.
Alright.

569
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.930
Pet peeves is when they cut to actors in the crowd and they ball up their fists

570
00:32:22.931 --> 00:32:26.020
like their fighters.
It's like,
dude,
we get it.
You're at a fight.
What do you do?

571
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:30.490
What if you had a baseball game?
Would you mind mine?
Like being at Bat,

572
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.960
I hate when people do shit like that.

573
00:32:31.961 --> 00:32:35.080
Especially if you're not a professional fighter.
Stop.
Stop balling up.
You fuck.

574
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.830
Oh,
if you played a fighter in a movie and you start balling up your fist,

575
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:42.080
what are,
what are you doing?
You know,
I swear to God,

576
00:32:42.081 --> 00:32:44.810
if I'm ever lucky enough to get close enough and if I ever get big enough that

577
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:45.920
they put the camera on me,

578
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.800
I'm going to keep it real and I'm not going to ball up my fist.

579
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.000
I'm going to imitate a ringer

580
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:50.983
<v 7>rolling.</v>

581
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.690
<v 0>I'm going to blow a kiss and do that stupid little hard thing that they do and</v>

582
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.030
that's going to be it.
I'm going to do a little wave,
you know,

583
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:05.270
representing.
Um,
it is always funny too,
when they,
when they cut to somebody too.

584
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:08.510
Did you see when they cut to Kanye West?
That's the funniest shit ever.

585
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.670
There's nothing more humbling if you think you're a fucking the,

586
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.260
you're the shit if you go to a professional fight.

587
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.260
Did you see the attorneys trying to smile and the camera's on him?

588
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:21.290
You could see his fucking brain turn it going.

589
00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.070
And after watching the fucking Nate Diaz,

590
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:29.840
Conor Mcgregor fucking epic fight that it was right.

591
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.850
That should have been a movie.
It was such a great fight.

592
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:34.040
And then they cut to Kanye west and the smile on his face,

593
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:38.070
you could see is his brain.
It was turning to just go on and,
and,
and why,

594
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:39.350
why do I talk so much shit

595
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.960
again on stage with a leather kilt and I rhyme stuff.

596
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.570
He's fucking guy's a gladiator's,
right?
Um,
any theirs.
And I'm telling you,

597
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.110
almost every UFC that I've ever seen,
there's always that guy.

598
00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:56.530
They always cut to somebody in the crowd that's usually talking shit.

599
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.980
And they try to smile their way through it and that they can't.
You see it.

600
00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.220
It's undeniable.
It's undeniable.
Um,

601
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.280
anyways,
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

602
00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:08.250
I got a couple of advertising things.
I have to,
uh,

603
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.170
I got to fucking read here at this point.

604
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.040
I'm calling him a Greg and I got a fucking shiny suit.
I got a pair of shoes.

605
00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:18.910
I got a whole fucking closet full of shiny suit and I got a pair of walking

606
00:34:18.911 --> 00:34:22.750
shoes to match all of them.
You're going to do fucking nothing.

607
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.800
That's one of the great fucking lines ever.
When Nate was yelling at him,

608
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.860
St Bloke,
and he goes,
you're going to do fucking nothing.

609
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:35.120
I would love to be able to say that to another man and fucking really believe it

610
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.910
because in the,
no matter how hard I said at the back of my head,
hey,

611
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:39.740
you know he's,
he's definitely going to get you a lot,
Bill.
I mean,

612
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:42.980
you gotta who's getting it?
You've got a huge head.
All right.
That's a big target.

613
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:47.930
It's hard to miss.
All right.
Do you think,
uh,
what's his face ever spark?

614
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.160
Ted Kennedy,
his giant fucking squash.

615
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.450
I would tell you that time I fucking met him.
Well,
too bad.

616
00:34:56.451 --> 00:34:59.090
I'm not going to tell you.
Oh,
come on with the fucking password.

617
00:34:59.091 --> 00:35:03.200
It's my computer at this point.
You know.
Can't you just fucking Kathy,

618
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.750

Look at me through the fucking camera at this point.

619
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.600

664
00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:01.020
that radius and then you know what you have.
You have a screenplay,

665
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.010
then you get that fucking guy who they always attack his family and he's coming

666
00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:09.300
to kill him.
Right?

helping the people out of the fucking rumble.

694
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:37.780

We can't end on some sad shit like that.

695
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.460

<v 0>out in the streets there is violence and now there are a lot of built we can't</v>

700
00:39:53.811 --> 00:39:55.280
listen to anymore.
You're singing all right,
whatever.

701
00:39:55.281 --> 00:39:57.200
I'll sing to myself on the fucking elliptical.

702
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.370
So I tried to look less like a fucking snowman.
Jesus Christ.
What happened to me?

703
00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.220
What happened to me?
I was doing so well.
How bill,
you know what you did.

704
00:40:04.221 --> 00:40:09.170
You know what you did is you ate a bunch of shitty food for days upon end,

705
00:40:09.171 --> 00:40:12.560
you got fat the same way everybody gets fat and now you're trying to act like

706
00:40:12.561 --> 00:40:16.040
you don't understand how it happened.
Okay?
Like you weren't there when it went,

707
00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.910
when it went down,
you reached out.
You could have grabbed an apple,

708
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.960
you could have had a banana,

709
00:40:20.961 --> 00:40:23.420
you could have got a salad and you reach right past those.

710
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.250
He went to the fucking whatever the fuck you wait.

711
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.630
<v 3>Okay.</v>

712
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:29.930
<v 0>Goddamn dope.
All right.
That's it.
That's the pie.
Okay.
Whatever.
All right,</v>

713
00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.793
here's some music.

714
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:31.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

715
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.040
<v 0>I don't know what it's going to be.
I know.</v>

716
00:40:34.041 --> 00:40:35.330
I'm sure if somebody is going to like it,

717
00:40:35.331 --> 00:40:38.110
somebody else's going to complain about it,
but I can tell you this right now.
I,

718
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.310
I,
I don't give a shit.
Okay.

719
00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.790
I'm tired of jet lagged.
I'm catching a cold and I'm fat.

720
00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.860
All right.
That's,
that's the report here.

721
00:40:48.861 --> 00:40:51.440
Reporting live from the Thursday afternoon podcasts and joy.

722
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:56.150
The greatest hits from a yesteryear and a podcast gone by.
Go fuck yourselves.

723
00:40:56.151 --> 00:41:00.800
Your cuts.
I'll talk to you on Monday.
Have a nice weekend.
Oh Jesus.

724
00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.100
<v 3>What do you check?
Is it TV is don't wait to</v>

725
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:13.743
put sad

726
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.930
no motherfucking ticket night.

727
00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:00.160
<v 1>Oh,
by the fucking way.
Not by the way people.</v>

728
00:42:00.161 --> 00:42:01.900
This is by the fucking way,

729
00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.700
which you know that I'm about ready to tell you some shit that I believe in
baby.

730
00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.870
Uh,
I'm at,
I'm at Logan Airport,

731
00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:16.210
Edward Lawrence Logan Airport.
I finally learned that,

732
00:42:16.211 --> 00:42:20.140
but Logan Airport has a,
as named after Eddie Lawrence Logan,

733
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.190
there was some sort of fucking a military person who fought in the Spanish

734
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.130
American war and that they used to have a statue of him before they had to make

735
00:42:27.131 --> 00:42:30.730
the airport even bigger because people are fucked it,
you know,

736
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.580
so I go there,
okay.

737
00:42:33.581 --> 00:42:37.150
And I go through security and they got the giant fucking microwave.

738
00:42:37.151 --> 00:42:41.380
They want me to stand in with my legs spread doing the Jay z symbol.

739
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:46.540
Right.
Well,
the Sammy Hagar from the 51 50 tour,

740
00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.890
depending on what generation you are,
a business,

741
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:52.090
depending on what side of the tracks you from.
All right.

742
00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.220
This podcast is for everybody.
Um,

743
00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.730
I'm sure someone in the village people did it there.

744
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.210
You see that reached out to the gay community swell guy.

745
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.490
Pat Myself on the back here.
So anyways,
I say I'm not fucking,

746
00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.650
you know,
I'm opting out.
All right,
sir.
Can you go stand over there?

747
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.450
I didn't even like standing over there.

748
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.300
I used to work in a fucking dental office when I would take an x ray,

749
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.610
somebody's tooth,
one little fucking thing.

750
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:23.170
And we put that camera right up to the side of the jaw week,
put a led vest,

751
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.650
all their vitals right down to their dick or who ha.

752
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:32.140
And then I left the fucking room,
stood behind a wall that had lead in it,

753
00:43:32.141 --> 00:43:36.850
and I pressed the fucking button.
Now I'm supposed to stand there.

754
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.550
You know,
like I'm just going into prison.
They do everything,

755
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:43.400
but you have your bend over and spread your fucking ass cheeks.
I'm like,

756
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:47.030
I'm not fucking doing it.
And I know what people are saying.
Well Bill,

757
00:43:47.031 --> 00:43:50.900
you talk on his cell phone,
right?
That's fucking radiation.

758
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.980
You fly in an airplane,
right?
That's fucking radiation.

759
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.450
I understand that.

760
00:43:56.451 --> 00:44:00.950
I am getting radiated throughout the course of the day in the way I live my

761
00:44:00.951 --> 00:44:04.040
life.
I understand that.
Okay.

762
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.870
But I don't need to get extra radiated.
So if there's a way to opt out,

763
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.060
believe me,
if there was a way to opt out of flying on a fucking airplane,

764
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:18.080
a viable way,
aside from just saying,

765
00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:19.250
fuck this business,

766
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.570
I'm going to buy an old bus and just drive around and that'll be my miserable

767
00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:26.150
life,
I would do it.

768
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.510
But the fact that I can just stand there for an extra five,
10,

769
00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:32.310
15 fucking minutes,
you know,

770
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.930
and rather than stand in that microwave,
I could just go over and just have some,

771
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:40.890
you know,
sort of cute male person,

772
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.680
pat down my ass with the back of his hands.

773
00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.860
Do you have pretty sensitive areas?
Uh,
I would much rather do that.
Okay.
And then,

774
00:44:53.861 --> 00:44:56.020
you know,
people giving me shit about it,
saying it's stupid,

775
00:44:56.021 --> 00:44:59.770
it's fucking pointless and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Well,
so anyway,
anyways,

776
00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:04.150
I met Eddie Lawrence,
Logan Airport,
Edward Lawrence,
and um,

777
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.910
I'm standing there,
I'm waiting,
you know,

778
00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.630
and whenever you want to get fucking patted down,
they wait for fucking ever.

779
00:45:10.631 --> 00:45:12.220
They'd make it take extra long.

780
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.100
I'm convinced that they do it just so you just say,
fuck it.

781
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:18.130
I'm going to go into the toaster.
All right.
But I don't give a shit.

782
00:45:18.131 --> 00:45:22.030
I was get to the airport early because I know the game that they're running over

783
00:45:22.031 --> 00:45:25.930
there.
Oh,
the lovely Nia.
Everybody.
Oh,
are you?

784
00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:29.760
Come over here talking to the microphone.
How you'd been,

785
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.130
we couldn't hear you last week.
Oh,
I've been great.
Thanks for asking.

786
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.170
Great to be back.
Are you reading from a script?
Oh,
who just woke up?

787
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:41.830
I am great.
Thank you for harassing.
Where's the Real Nia?

788
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.860
Who is a sexy robot that was replaced?
Listen to this shit.

789
00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:46.570
I'm telling this story about,
you know,

790
00:45:46.571 --> 00:45:50.470
I always opt out of doing the Jay z thing where they radiate everything,

791
00:45:50.471 --> 00:45:54.850
but you fucking taint at the airport.
Yeah.
You know,
you fucking,

792
00:45:54.851 --> 00:45:59.260
you have your hands like the whole sign.
Isn't that what it is?
Yeah.
So,

793
00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.910
um,
I'm standing there waiting,
right?
And I'm staring down some baldheaded Douche.

794
00:46:03.911 --> 00:46:07.240
Who knows?
First of all,
they always have some chick there and she just goes,

795
00:46:07.241 --> 00:46:12.160
you know,
what are they,
what are they,
what do they say?
A male.
Oh,
what is it?

796
00:46:12.161 --> 00:46:16.480
What they say,
male pat down or whatever they say,
male support.

797
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:21.670
I'll five.
Whatever the fuck they say,
and it's typical chick voice where it,

798
00:46:21.671 --> 00:46:25.720
it can,
it can only carry you guys aren't good at yelling.

799
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:26.783
Yes we are.

800
00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.053
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

801
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.830
<v 1>No one hears it.
No one hears it.
All right,
go ahead.</v>

802
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.540
You know I've got the microphone away.
Yell male support aisle for yell at.

803
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:41.570
I want to hear it.
I wanna hear it.
That's good.

804
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:45.530
That has a sense of fucking urgency.
All right then.
You know what?

805
00:46:45.531 --> 00:46:47.030
They don't put their fucking heart in it.

806
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:52.390
They just go a mail pack down house screaming like there's something going down

807
00:46:52.911 --> 00:46:54.560
or whatever.
But you got to communicate.

808
00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.220
You've got to communicate to those bald fatties guys down there.

809
00:46:58.221 --> 00:47:01.730
We're going to put the back of their hands on my ash there.
They don't,

810
00:47:01.731 --> 00:47:02.451
they don't get it.

811
00:47:02.451 --> 00:47:05.750
They have a whole little system that they're talking to each other that you was

812
00:47:05.751 --> 00:47:08.660
fucking side.
He want here,
not yours obviously.
All right,

813
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.760
well listen to this shit.
Listen to this shit.
Let me,
let me get to the point.
Hey,

814
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.060
go get timeout.
Timeout.
Get another microphone.
Get another microphone.

815
00:47:17.061 --> 00:47:21.140
Hang on a second.
We're actually going to pause the podcast part of the podcast.

816
00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.240
All right,
so the magic of hitting pause or something I never do on this thing.

817
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.370
Actually hit pause there.
Uh,
so anyways,
this is the deal.

818
00:47:28.371 --> 00:47:31.180
So I'm going through security after all these people

819
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.510
<v 8>kill me.
Laguna,
you're already getting rid of the itching anyways man.</v>

820
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.220
<v 1>So why not stand there and have literally have your entire body budget tank lit</v>

821
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:43.520
up,
right?
So fucking standing there and this lady is going to,

822
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.940
you know,
and I'm like,
they're not hearing you.
They're not here.

823
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.920
And then she goes,
circuit.
You stand over.
There I go.

824
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:52.930
I'm going to stand right in and you'd watch my wallet.
Okay,

825
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:56.560
you can stand right there.
All right.
So anyways,
this fucking,

826
00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:01.810
this Asian kid comes up.
Fat Asian Kid,
one of the rare ones.
Why?

827
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:05.830
Why?
Like like,
like,
like,
like a white elephant.
Why is that relevant?

828
00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.400
Because AGP great shape.
They eat great.
I don't know what it is.

829
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.670
There were fucking awesome shape there.
And every once in awhile you see one,

830
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.000
you see a fat Asian,
you're like,
Holy Shit.
Right?

831
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.630
I don't mean like he's a fucking did it on purpose to sumo wrestle.

832
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.860
This is just a fact.
Sumo,
sumo,
Samoan,
whatever the fuck it is.

833
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:28.300
This fat Asian kid comes up and relevant to the story,
but it is for the comedy.

834
00:48:28.301 --> 00:48:32.560
It is.
Oh,
I see.
All right.
Sorry.
Come on.
Listen,

835
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:35.480
I trashed waspy fucking white people on this.
Oh,
you did?

836
00:48:35.481 --> 00:48:39.380
Did you talk about Nantucket?
Yes I did.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Yeah.

837
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:43.990
See you just hate him and it's crawling hate anybody I don't have hate in my

838
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:48.670
heart.
All right,
shut up.
Listen.
So this,
this,
this,
this person.

839
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.910
This fat kid comes up.
All right.

840
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:57.280
And The lady and the Lady's,
cause he couldn't even,
here he goes.
He's like,

841
00:48:57.281 --> 00:49:01.870
what it,
hey.
He's like,
what?
And I want to be like,
how old are you?

842
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.340
That's what the fuck she's trying to say.

843
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:08.470
And he goes 13 and she goes,
all right,
come over here.

844
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:11.560
And she had him go through the old school one.
Yeah.

845
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:18.070
So basically you want me to stand in something that could kill a 13 year old.

846
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.380
That's what the fuck I'm supposed to do.

847
00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:24.760
He know I'm the white weight on the way out on the way back twice,
two times,

848
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.601
two times that.

849
00:49:25.601 --> 00:49:29.410
Four Times a month I'm going to stand in this thing that can kill a 13 year old.

850
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.430
I'm sure I can't kill it.
Maybe like can affect his like um,

851
00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:37.930
puberty or his growth or something.
I think women sucked his dick.

852
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.240
I have a dick to what?
Cause my Dick's all down.

853
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.100
You're taking old 30 grown your ball.

854
00:49:44.101 --> 00:49:48.040
They're like down between your knees cubes.
No one that cares about it anymore.

855
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.500
Like it's just kinda like out of commission.

856
00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.180
I think women can avoid that full body thing by saying that they're pregnant and

857
00:49:55.181 --> 00:49:55.901
they won't let you go.

858
00:49:55.901 --> 00:49:58.030
They won't make you go in there if you say that you're pregnant.

859
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.050
Women always have the,
I'm just a girl excuse.

860
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:06.640
That's the girl things that guys have to do.
But stick with the thing here.

861
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:10.150
If that fucking thing.
How old are you?

862
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:15.280
13 get over here at him from getting like chest hair or something.
But you,
yeah,

863
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:17.050
you're old.
Like they don't care about you.

864
00:50:17.051 --> 00:50:20.620
It's the youth of tomorrow that we're concerned about.
Oh,
there you go.

865
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:25.090
I sat there and I,
I man,
I almost,

866
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.940
I'm not even a,
it's,
this isn't about me whether I feel like I'm older,
not,

867
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:32.760
I know I'm old.
I'm talking about submarine bed.
Um,

868
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:38.030
I almost high five myself.
I actually,
I burst out laughing,

869
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:42.910
extra laughed cause I wanted fucking marry mumbles to be like,
Eh,

870
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.470
it Mary mumble.
Yeah.
What are you laughing at?

871
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.600
I'm laughing cause I'm doing the right thing.

872
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.960
If that fucking thing isn't safe for a God damn 30,

873
00:50:50.961 --> 00:50:54.770
I could see if it was a bit and making some little baby crawls through there.

874
00:50:55.660 --> 00:51:00.050
It's a fucking kid.
Probably knows more about computers than I do and they like,

875
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.420
yeah,
no,
don't think so.

876
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.613
<v 3>Come over here.</v>

877
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:19.940
[inaudible]

878
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.100
what's going on the

879
00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:10.800
<v 9>Monday morning
and once again,
I am in an airport</v>

880
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.540
on my way to a is a big week for me.

881
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.760
This is the week leading up to my,
uh,
to my standup special,

882
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.760
which will be this Sunday night,

883
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:27.900
August 31st on a comedy central.

884
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.650
I can tell I'm reaching for ship,
even order set,

885
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.240
when you're talking to somebody on the phone,

886
00:52:33.241 --> 00:52:37.410
you can tell if they're talking to you as a talk and give their looking around

887
00:52:37.411 --> 00:52:41.280
their desk,
you know,
you're talking to them and then they get there.

888
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:46.370
They start doing a sentence like I'm doing right now or it takes a real long

889
00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:51.360
time to say it.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

890
00:52:51.361 --> 00:52:53.730
What the announcements.
Um,
anyways,
yeah.

891
00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:56.940
So this is what I got going on this week.

892
00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:01.400
If any of you podcast's listeners actually have a radio,
um,

893
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.750
I'm going to be doing a ton of radio this week and um,

894
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.370
why don't we just start this whole fucking thing over again?

895
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:15.510
This is unreal.
I think I'm in the crossroads here.

896
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.130
Okay,
great.
Number six,
it 1130.

897
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.500
Now the guy with the deep voice is waiting.

898
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:27.740
It's going to be his turn in a second.
We got it.

899
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:31.950
And it's a small jet,
a small jet.
So if you have a role on you must check it.

900
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:37.350
That's what's going to be mean about fucking 45 minutes.
Um,

901
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:41.520
I like those little jets.
I don't mind.
They don't bug me.
Um,

902
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.890
anyways.
Uh,
yeah.
So this week coming up,
um,

903
00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:50.740
shoes can see in the top of my myspace page.
My one hour stand up special.
Geez.

904
00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.730
Good Lord.
Okay.
All right.
Anyways,

905
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.160
just ridiculous.

906
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:08.550
What are the 10 flights leaving at the same time?
Oh,
Jesus.
Danny,

907
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:13.020
where are you?
Um,
all right,
let's try it again.
Okay.

908
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:17.190
I have a my one hour stand up special coming out.
It's like getting heckled.

909
00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:24.780
Who is talking?
Okay,

910
00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.190
here we go.
I have my one hour standup special this Sunday,

911
00:54:29.191 --> 00:54:33.420
August 31st at 11:00 PM on comedy central called,
why do I do this?

912
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.350
Please watch it if you get a chance.
Okay.
And this week leading up,

913
00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:38.670
I'm going to be doing a bunch of media.

914
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.410
So if you have a radio in your car or whatever and you want to listen to me tap

915
00:54:43.411 --> 00:54:46.680
dance,
I got some big radio shows coming up tomorrow.

916
00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:51.330
I'm going to be on the Bob and Tom Show.
Uh,

917
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.420
I dunno.
I mean those guys are all over the country,

918
00:54:54.421 --> 00:54:57.150
so I don't know when it's coming on.
Whenever the Bob and Tom Show comes on,

919
00:54:57.151 --> 00:54:58.380
I'm gonna be on that show tomorrow.

920
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:04.140
And then I fly in to New York and later on that afternoon I'm going to be on

921
00:55:04.141 --> 00:55:08.390
Sirius satellite radio and it's going to be a,

922
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.640
I'm going to be on the Jim Breuer Breuer unleashed the p Ellie Lenny market and

923

924
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:19.770
And then right after that show,

925
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.800
I'm doing one hour of my own hype for my special this Sunday on Sirius satellite

926

938
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:22.740

957
00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:47.080
And I think,
uh,
some more serious satellite shows,

958
00:57:47.081 --> 00:57:49.180
but I'd dug just realizing this is getting fucking born.

959
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:52.900
I'm doing a bunch of radio.
Okay.
That's what I'm doing.
So anyways,

960
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:57.250
if you new to my page,
this is what I do.
I do podcasts once a week on Monday.

961
00:57:57.251 --> 00:58:01.690
I try to be funny,
give people something to laugh above the first day of work.

962
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:05.530
And I actually got a nice email from somebody reminding me to let you guys know

963
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:10.300
that you can actually subscribe to this podcast on iTunes.
I'm,
I keep her,

964
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:14.230
I've never said that,
I don't think,
but you can subscribe to it.
And a,

965
00:58:14.231 --> 00:58:16.270
this person says you don't have to read this out loud,

966
00:58:16.271 --> 00:58:20.410
but I love the podcast and subscribe on Itunes for probably a year now.

967
00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:25.360
Um,
I listened to it every Monday at the gym.

968
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.920
I think that's really cool.
So does that mean you're listening right now,

969
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:32.950
you're on the treadmill,
you're on the elliptical.

970
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.780
Is there a some really sweaty,
hairy person to the right of you?

971
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.030
You know those Robin William Forums and no matter how far away you get from
them,

972
00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:46.900
that arm hair,
sweat somehow still hits you.
You haven't had that.

973
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:48.850
You have a gun like played like fucking uh,

974
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:53.110
he played one on one pickup basketball.

975
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:56.050
There's always that other guy and the other team that just sweats profusely.

976
00:58:56.510 --> 00:59:00.910
Oh wait a minute.
They all right.
They actually did that.
They did a skit on that,

977
00:59:00.911 --> 00:59:05.050
didn't they?
In the cable guy,
which I think is a very underrated movie.

978
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:09.670
And if you want to talk about overrated,
I saw tropic thunder.

979
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:13.840
I don't know what the big fucking deal was about that movie,
but Jesus Christ,

980
00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:17.920
just a regular movie.
You don't want to think it was,

981
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:22.950
I think it was because it had so many inside and the industry was so excited

982
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:28.850
that they understood the jokes that they were like extra laughing.

983
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:30.560
I see that every once in a while.

984
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:34.080
I was talking about that with Joe to Rosa this morning.
How it's so much.

985
00:59:34.081 --> 00:59:38.210
Sometimes you go into these,
uh,
these comedy clubs and a comedian,

986
00:59:38.211 --> 00:59:42.560
I'll make a joke that's really inside and then there's always that comic at the

987
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:46.310
back of the club has got to be like,
ah Ha.
Ah Ha ha ha.

988
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.320
They're not even laughing.
They might want to be like,
I get it.
I'm in the loop.

989
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:56.490
But,
uh,
that's what I felt like that movie was it just a,
I don't know.

990
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:01.520
I don't know what the big fucking deal was.
First of all,

991
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:03.470
that movie was about 20 years too late.

992
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:07.550
They should have made that movie in 1988 when everyone was going to go see those

993
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:10.160
movies,
you know?
Um,

994
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.210
but for me just being a little comfy movie reviewer here and whatever,

995
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.130
you know what I mean?
I shouldn't,
I should get mad at them.

996
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.010
They just tried to make a funny movie,
but everybody else told me it was awesome.

997
01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:20.750
All right.

998
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:25.750
I just tried to talk over that guy on the speaker and I immediately became a

999
01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:28.730
loud guy on the cell phone and some lady just shot me a look.

1000
01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.210
So I'm not to bring it down to my,
uh,

1001
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:37.510
my bill burr in the evening.
Late night DJ voice here.
All right,

1002
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:41.050
let's get to the podcast questions here before I get on my,
uh,

1003
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:45.430
what I like to consider my private jet.
I'm actually flying US air and uh,

1004
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:50.300
for those of you don't travel USA was the Danny Baldwin of airlines.

1005
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:54.770
You know what I mean?
It's a reputable airline but just doesn't really,

1006
01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.230
it doesn't get a lot of big parts,
you know what I mean?

1007
01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:00.830
It was good and trees lounge,
but a

1008
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.480
us,
there's just one of those like,
you know,
you know,
like,

1009
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:09.370
like,
uh,

1010
01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:14.060
remember that Sitcom like Caroline in the city where it was just one of those

1011
01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:19.061
shows that was just on for like fucking eight years and he had no idea why and

1012
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.050
you'd forget that it existed.

1013
01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:23.810
And then every once in a while you'd be home on a Friday night going through a

1014
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:24.680
breakup or something.

1015
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.980
And all of a sudden you click through and they would be Caroline in the city and

1016
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:32.230
you just think like,
really,
they're,
they're still making these things.
That's,

1017
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:37.010
that's what US Airways is.
I've got US airways.
Like,
you know,

1018
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.610
I just thought that they did that they were tired,
you know what I mean?

1019
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:46.210
Like they went in the Poconos or,
uh,
whatever the word.

1020
01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:47.620
What's up with the fucking said that.

1021
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.620
What's that circuit that all those Jewish comics used to play in upstate New

1022
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.750
York?
You know what I'm talking about?
Or is it in Pennsylvania?

1023
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.880
I never did the Borscht belt.

1024
01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:02.140
I thought USA US airways was like hanging out with TWA and Eastern Airlines.

1025
01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:07.310
You guys old like me.
Do you,
do you remember Eastern Airlines back when,

1026
01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.130
when airlines,
airlines had specific routes,

1027
01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:14.630
they had dominance and uh,
this is,
this is pretty,
before they broke up,

1028
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:19.130
the monopoly of what they consider to be a monopoly was back in the day.

1029
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:23.640
They used to have.
Uh,
they used to just like if you were,

1030
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.210
if you weren't living on the east coast and you wish you knew were going to

1031
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:31.250
Disneyland or Disney world,
I guess that's the one that Florida get.

1032
01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:36.090
Her only option was eastern airlines or you jumped in a station wagon with wood

1033
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:38.190
paneling.
There was no internet.

1034
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:42.430
I think you could take a pesto on the plane to do,

1035
01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.170
you just have in your pocket and as long as you didn't wave it around,

1036
01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.200
no one gave a fuck.
Like,

1037
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:51.740
I mean there were no metal detectors like in the late sixties if you can believe

1038
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:52.704
that.

1039
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.120
Like you could literally just walk right up to the ticketing agent with your

1040
01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:59.550
briefcase,
you know what I mean?
Oh,

1041
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:01.800
those were the days I missed out on him though.

1042
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:05.520
He could bang the stewards and stewardesses were actually hot and you could

1043
01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:09.390
actually call them stewardesses.
All right.
There's a woman with a tank top on.

1044
01:03:09.391 --> 01:03:13.830
I just caught her smelling her armpit and then the inside of her white feeder.

1045
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:19.230
And it's funny because she was standing behind me online and I was like,
I mean,

1046
01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:22.380
she's just looking like the all American girl,
right.
But she also has boots on,

1047
01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:27.200
so she was a little slutty.
So it's like perfect.
She'd be a great mom and a,

1048
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:30.870
maybe she takes it in the age.
So I usually don't,
I usually don't go for those.

1049
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.800
You don't go for the blue humor,
but,
uh,

1050
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:40.110
I just kind of ruined her for me on some level.
Not really.
You know what I mean?

1051
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:44.790
Just saying on a first date,
one of those first,
uh,
you know,

1052
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:47.700
imaginary dates that I'm having with the right now as I sit across from her.

1053
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:49.590
I didn't,
I didn't need to see that.
You know what I mean?

1054
01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.760
Now she's probably going to order the fucking lobster and she's really gonna

1055
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.260
Piss me off.
Um,
anyways,

1056
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:56.970
I was actually talking about something interesting in the,
Oh yeah,

1057
01:03:56.971 --> 01:03:59.370
back in the day.
Yeah,
you could,
you could bang the stewardesses,

1058
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:04.230
you could call them stewardesses and poem.
Poland.
They touch,
you know,

1059
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:07.320
drinking was acceptable.
You could fucking smoke cigarettes.
I don't even smoke.

1060
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.730
It's just something funny about that,

1061
01:04:08.731 --> 01:04:13.731
like everything was seemed to be like a lounge in the late sixties early

1062
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.130
seventies you know what I mean?
The goddamn free for all.

1063
01:04:17.131 --> 01:04:20.520
It's pre herpes pre aids.
That's something you need it.
You need,

1064
01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:25.521
you needed a bottle of Jack and a and some penicillin and you in a briefcase and

1065
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:31.260
you were good to go.
I think I might have talked about this on a,

1066
01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:36.150
on a on a previous podcast,
but back in the day Pan Am airlines.

1067
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:41.220
I feel like I'm talking about old rock groups,
grand funk,
railroad,
airlines,

1068
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:42.690
Pan Am airlines.

1069
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:47.190
Back in the day when you flew first class into New York City,

1070
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.160
the metlife building used to be called the Pan Am building.

1071
01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.370
I think I knew I already told this story,
but just for people who are new,

1072
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.900
bear with me.
He used to fly in first class.
You've landed JFK,

1073
01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.820
you got off,

1074
01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:05.060
you got on a helicopter and then you flew in a helicopter to the top of the Pan

1075
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:10.230
Am building in Manhattan and then you got out like fucking James Bond.

1076
01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:14.790
You took the elevator down,
jumped in a cab and,
and,
and you went back,

1077
01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:19.830
you know,
you to your hotel,
you know,

1078
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.580
probably at least one other stewards.
Those were the Goddamn days.

1079
01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:28.480
Those were the days.
Those were the days.
You know what I mean?

1080
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.210
Those big ass fucking cars,
people used to drive to damn damn.
You know,

1081
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:37.360
I help them when they come in with,
with hydrogen or whatever the new energy is.

1082
01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.590
I hope they go back to big cars because if you're not polluting the environment,

1083
01:05:41.591 --> 01:05:46.591
there's no reason not to have a trunk that you could put Billy Batson.

1084
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.380
You know what I'm saying?
All right.
That's my little fucking,

1085
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:53.370
if editorial for the week,
let's get onto the podcast questions.
Shall We?

1086
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.260
All right.
Question number one.
Bill,

1087
01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.150
did you ever have any car trouble when you used to drive from Gig to Gig?

1088
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.530
Yeah,
I did.
I used to,

1089
01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:06.860
I drove an 83 Ford Ranger and um,

1090
01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.830
it had it,
it had overheating issues and I uh,

1091
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.830
I learned a lot about how to fix cars back then cause I basically,

1092
01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:19.060
it had a four cylinder,
you know,
no computer chip,
you know what I mean?

1093
01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:21.420
Back in the day you had to be a moron not to,

1094
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:26.290
not to know how to do like basic stuff.
And the engine was also,
you know,

1095
01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.970
was,
was facing forward.

1096
01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.140
There wasn't sitting sideways like some slot on a horse trying to pretend like

1097
01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:36.190
she hasn't banged everybody on the prairie.
Um,
it was,

1098
01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:40.240
it was faced front to back.
So everything was really was really easy to get to.

1099
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:44.140
Even with a four cylinder,
there was enough room,
distributor cap was right there.

1100
01:06:44.141 --> 01:06:48.760
And uh,
yeah,
I had to,
uh,
I never missed a gig though.

1101
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.640
I never missed a Gig,
but I definitely had to drive with the heat on.

1102
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:54.790
You remember doing that?
You'd drive it like 50 miles an hour.

1103
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:59.410
I had black vinyl seats.
Picture that.
There's a,
there's a picture for you,
right?

1104
01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:03.220
A redhead wearing jeans and a and is,

1105
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:07.540
I'm going to kill on stage shirt with black vinyl seats.

1106
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:08.950
Um,

1107
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:14.530
with my watching the needle go up and I had to,
uh,
I'm sorry,

1108
01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.950
I just got distracted cause there's some little baby was the creepiest looking

1109
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:22.450
stuffed little doll I've ever seen in my life.
It looks like one of,

1110
01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.450
ah,
fuck.
What is the name of that movie?

1111
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.350
Let's hit Sarah Jessica Parker movie for the kids.
Eyes were all wide.

1112
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:31.450
That's what the dog looks like.

1113
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.690
Why don't I keep thinking that movie's called Gotcha.

1114
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:42.280
Gatica it doesn't begin with the g
the chip.

1115
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:46.300
It's the something,
the job,

1116
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:50.500
not that [inaudible] Dennis leary show.
Uh,
what the fuck is it?

1117
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.120
The,
it's the something and it begins with a g,

1118
01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:57.590
right?
God dammit.

1119
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.550
That would have been great if I just had that reference at the top of my head.

1120
01:08:00.551 --> 01:08:04.870
I could just fucking blow right it,
but I didn't.
So anyways,

1121
01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:05.690
you know what,

1122
01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:09.220
actually that brought up a memory too of driving over to Dane Cook's house way

1123
01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:14.221
back in the day with my drum kit in the back as he played guitar to go play some

1124
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:18.680
green day and something else.
Who else was big back then?
It was like 94.

1125
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:24.260
Who's the guys who sang that song?
Uh,
pretty fly for a white guy.

1126
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:26.060
We didn't play that song but it was another son.

1127
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.750
It was just a horrific set list and we had a great time,

1128
01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:33.600
but I had to drive over to his house with the fucking heat on.
Um,

1129
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.140
and I was probably listening to Alison Change Jar flies.
There you go.

1130
01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.520
There's my pre Kurt Cobain killing himself memory.

1131
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.860
Well that might've been post April 94.
Who knows.
All right.
Um,

1132
01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.620
somebody asked me another question.

1133
01:08:51.621 --> 01:08:55.460
Was the micro bigly a incident at the last ONA show?

1134
01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.880
The confirmation that comedians need to forever stay away from those events?

1135
01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:06.530
Uh,
what did you say to Mike when he called you about,
about it?
Um,

1136
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:08.450
it was a confirmation.

1137
01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:10.970
Now it was a confirmation cause I was actually going to do that Gig,

1138
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:15.050
but I couldn't get out of this other gig that I was doing in Denver and it was a

1139
01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:19.070
fucking nightmare.
But,
um,
no I don't,
I don't think it's,
it's confirmation.

1140
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:19.940
I think,
uh,

1141
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.980
I think it's still a cool event and I just think,
you know,

1142
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:29.780
it's like life every once in a while you're not paying attention and you hit a

1143
01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:33.980
pole.
While I had a dream about that last night,
I had a dream last night.

1144
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:38.981
I saw an old guy swerving a big old car and slammed into a telephone pole and I

1145
01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:44.180
kept driving a lot of shit for reminding me of stuff on this podcast.

1146
01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:46.430
It's really weird.
I'm very reflective.
Okay.

1147
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:48.980
What did you say to Mike when he called you about it?
First of all,

1148
01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:53.270
Mike called me up and the sound of his voice,

1149
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.490
he literally goes,
did you hear what happened?
I thought a comedian died.

1150
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.600
I thought somebody died the way he said it.
And I was like,
oh my God,
who died?

1151
01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.140
Right.
And He,
and then he started telling me the story.

1152
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:08.690
I just laughed and I was like,
dude,
it doesn't even count.

1153
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:12.380
Getting booed on a show like that is like a,

1154
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:17.570
it's like getting the standing ovation after a v e t set.
You know what I mean?

1155
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.160
It just,
it just happens to everybody so it loses its value.

1156
01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:27.920
Uh,
I dunno.
I thought it was,
I still laughed.
It's funny.

1157
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.410
What are you going to do?
It's kind of a rite of passage now.

1158
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:34.510
It's like he can now go out and get the standup comedy forces,

1159
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:39.140
the Special Forces Tattoo on your arm.
All right.
And uh,
so now,

1160
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.060
um,
I don't think so.

1161
01:10:41.061 --> 01:10:44.270
Like I love Olin and I love those guys and I really liked the fans and

1162
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:46.640
everything like that,
but every once in a while it's a little crazy,
you know,

1163
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.810
every once in awhile I have too much to drink.
Right.
It happens.
No big deal.

1164
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.940
Alright.
Um,
anyways.
Okay.
And then his overrated,
underrated,

1165
01:10:56.030 --> 01:11:00.170
overrated.
Facebook underrated my space podcast.
Thank you very much.

1166
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.790
All right,
uh,
next question.
If you ever had a roommate,

1167
01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:08.270
what's the most annoying thing that they ever did?
Uh,

1168
01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:13.380
I feel like Coby Brian Right now,
naming names here.
Shaq did it.
Um,

1169
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:18.930
I lived with,
uh,
Robert Kelly who,
well,
I had the CD out.
Let me,
uh,

1170
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.830
let me hide his,

1171
01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:23.640
his product here before I talk about the annoying thing that he used to do.

1172
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:27.990
Robert Kelly has a new CD called just the tip.
It's absolutely hilarious.

1173
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:33.090
I was listening to what the other night and a son of a bitches,
a funny pastor.

1174
01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:34.620
Then,
uh,
if you want to buy it,

1175
01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:36.750
you can actually click on his picture right on my page.

1176
01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.190
Bald headed dude with just the tip of his head as you get it.
Anyways,

1177
01:11:41.191 --> 01:11:43.920
I lived with him and he had this annoying habit of right before he went out to

1178
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:44.754
do shows.

1179
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:50.180
He would clean his ears and somehow the cleaning of his ears was in the middle

1180
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:54.960
of his whole getting ready and he would always forget to take his dirty,

1181
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:56.850
filthy q-tips off of the sink.

1182
01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.750
I think it did it on purpose after awhile and then I would walk in there and see

1183
01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:04.040
Bobby Kelly's earwax.
Um,

1184
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.420
wow.
Okay.
Some girl just walked by.
I swear to God I saw on Hollywood boulevard,

1185
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:13.140
light skinned black girl with the biggest ass I've ever seen in my life.

1186
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:17.730
I'm wearing white sweatpants.
I say pink on the back.

1187
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:23.570
Her hair is picture Halle berry with like a partial Mohawk in the back.

1188
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.740
It's bleached blonde.

1189
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.800
And then where it swoops up on the left side is pink and her semi mullet in the

1190
01:12:31.231 --> 01:12:35.370
back is also pink.
I want a dog is pick.
Yes.

1191
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:39.630
So it's the same person and that's her sidekick.
The big ass twins.

1192
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.350
Oh my God.
I gotta take a picture and that's fucking hilarious.

1193
01:12:43.351 --> 01:12:47.580
How often do you see the same freak and I both wearing pink.

1194
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:53.850
Wow.
Now kids are coming over to pet their dog and was a white dog that they dyed

1195
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.090
pink and she has earrings that are little stars.

1196
01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.670
Everybody has a drink.
Okay.
You know what they look like?

1197
01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:07.050
Extras and a weird science.
You don't.
If they did like the black version,

1198
01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.520
which I swear to God,
you can get made.

1199
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.430
It's weird science except it's black.
We love it.
All right.

1200
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:18.420
Um,
long rambling podcast question for you,
Bill.

1201
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:22.110
You talk of saying too much porn or whatever,

1202
01:13:22.111 --> 01:13:26.280
fucked up videos on the Internet and how you feel your soul is pixelating away.

1203
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:31.500
I think this is unfortunately how I feel about stand up as much as I love it.

1204
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:36.000
I don't know that it even matters if it's clean or dirty.

1205
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:39.240
It's like when you were saying in your blog about Seinfeld's comedy,

1206
01:13:39.241 --> 01:13:44.241
how you don't think people realize that he's actually kind of angry because of

1207
01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:49.170
the way he packages it to where you're going with this company moves me and gets

1208
01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:53.190
me in my soul.
But it seems unavoidably cynical and negative in nature.

1209
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.670
You have to constantly prick and Nag,
scrutinize people's life.

1210
01:13:57.830 --> 01:14:00.570
I should have had an editor on this one.
I guess my question is,

1211
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:05.190
this is what I should have read.
Can a comedian or even a comedy fan be happy?

1212
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:11.740
Uh,
does life as a comedian scar you and make you formerly okay.

1213
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:15.400
Fundamentally an okay person front.
Okay.

1214
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:20.401
Does basically you saying are you an unhappy negative douche and that's what

1215
01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:27.361
makes you become a comedian or are you a wide eyed jack ass and then you become

1216
01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:33.130
a comedian and then that makes you when I get an asshole,
um,

1217
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:36.120
for me it was a little bit of both.
Um,

1218
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.730
I had a lot of anger that I wasn't even aware of and then I got into stand up

1219
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:42.060
comedy and uh,

1220
01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.980
has a wide eyed jack ass and eventually,
um,
I think if,

1221
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:49.970
I don't know,
my team has kind of caught up with me.
You know what,

1222
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.640
this is how I look at it because I don't think it's specifically just a standup

1223
01:14:53.650 --> 01:14:58.480
thing.
If you're fucking up your life and you're 20 years old,

1224
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.290
it's not that bad cause you haven't had time to veer too far off the road.

1225
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.360
And even if you did,
you're only 20,

1226
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.380
so your other high school classmates did just finishing up their sophomore

1227
01:15:08.381 --> 01:15:11.260
beginning of junior year in college.
So no matter what,

1228
01:15:11.261 --> 01:15:14.380
they're not making six figures,
they don't have a big house,
they don't have kids.

1229
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:17.680
You don't feel like the too far behind and you feel like you can right the ship,

1230
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:20.920
but when you get older and you still fucking up,

1231
01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.420
that's when you know,
it's kind of like when they launch this,

1232
01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.520
like one of those probes to go to Mars.

1233
01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:32.350
If they're off by literally a centimeter by the time it gets to Mars.

1234
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:36.040
You know what I'm saying?
It's like,
it's like 40 miles off track.

1235
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:37.810
I don't know the fucking numbers.
I never looked it up.

1236
01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:42.040
I don't want you to discovery channel,
but uh,
you know what I'm saying?

1237
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.180
That's why I think as you get older,
like that kind of stuff happens.
Um,

1238
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.420
but also,
yeah,
there are a lot of people who are negative.

1239
01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:53.830
I'm trying not to be that way,
but uh,
you know,
it's a battle.

1240
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.060
I haven't drank and fucking 11 days and,
uh,

1241
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:02.200
I can't say that I don't miss it and,

1242
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:06.700
but I also kind of miss it just certain certain times.
I miss it.

1243
01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.540
Now I'm starting to get the sweat.
So let's fucking move on before I,
okay,

1244
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:13.150
let's get into the underrated overrated.
This has been like a big,

1245
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:15.330
a big topic on the podcast.

1246
01:16:15.331 --> 01:16:19.570
Everybody likes people like talking about shift that they think is that they

1247
01:16:19.571 --> 01:16:21.970
love and nobody else loves.
So they think it's underrated.

1248
01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:26.950
And then people also like the overrated shit.
Like I just said,
tropic thunder.

1249
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:30.030
Fucking overrated.
Alright,
I gotta watch my language on that.

1250
01:16:30.031 --> 01:16:32.170
Allow surrounded by people.
All right.
Underrated.

1251
01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.000
Figuring things out for yourself.

1252
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:40.110
My friend installs home theater system and a lady paid him 50 bucks to come over

1253
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:45.070
and fix this high tech,
universal remote.
It turns out the batteries were dead.

1254
01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.990
So basically what he's saying is,
why don't you use your fucking brain?

1255
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.560
He had down Twan wasn't me,
Kirsten again.
All right.
Uh,

1256
01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:58.270
people being nice lady hit my car in the parking lot and actually left the note.

1257
01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:02.410
You know what?
That's an old school classy thing to do.
But you know what?

1258
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:05.380
When you leave the note,
you're nervous because you might,

1259
01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:09.620
you might be leaving it on the car up the neck,
dude,

1260
01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.950
which is going to sue you for the hell of it.
All right,

1261
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.100
I gotta wrap this podcast up.

1262
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:15.770
I'm getting surrounded by people and they're all looking at me like I'm a
maniac.

1263
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.110
All right.
More off overrated stuff.
Starship troopers,
Mitch Mitchell,

1264
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:26.180
drummer of the experience.
You,
those of you who don't know,
uh,
overrated,

1265
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:30.800
every band that has come out in the new millennium
racing mufflers.

1266
01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1267
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.900
I don't get that because you're going two miles an hour and those things and it

1268
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:40.130
makes them sound like you going 80 miles an hour,
which really just,
you know,

1269
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:44.630
kind of lets the audience know that the Rappites already in the hat.
Oh,

1270
01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:47.480
it just sounds like it's going fast even when you're not going fast.

1271
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.980
Journey's new lead singer.
Yeah,
I heard that.
Some Karaoke guy.

1272
01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:56.510
Oh God,
you had a baby.
But that's not sitting behind me on the flight.

1273
01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:02.420
Um,
can we get a little core form rag over there please?

1274
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:06.530
All right.
Uh,
overrated.
Kim Kardashians.
Oh,

1275
01:18:06.531 --> 01:18:10.850
did something last week.
Yeah.
Underrated black chicks.

1276
01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:13.600
Um,
I didn't know they were underrated.

1277
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:17.443
I've always loved them.

1278
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.670
I might be the only guy walking watch and track track and field.
Um,

1279
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:27.980
what else?
Uh,
you know what needs to be getting everybody going ape shit up.

1280
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:31.240
I don't get is the Jonas brothers do the Jonas brothers,
man,
that's,

1281
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:35.150
that's par for the course.
There's always going to be the INSYNC,

1282
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:40.220
the Keith Partridge.
It's a market.
You know what I mean?

1283
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:44.030
And uh,
I get it.
They definitely suck in that type of thing,

1284
01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:47.180
but I can't stand when people flip out about that stuff when they act like

1285
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:51.230
people who are 28 actually listening to the Jonas by the citizen.

1286
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:56.260
It's a bunch of girls who like writing their names and glitter and drawing

1287
01:18:56.421 --> 01:18:59.600
unicorns.
They listened to them.
Okay.
And uh,

1288
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.850
I think the only guy who was in poofing up his hair,
um,

1289
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:08.330
is the one that's going to be the breakout star and could possibly have a live

1290
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:13.400
past the age of 19.
But those other two guys with the poofed up hair,
you know,

1291
01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:13.551
it's,

1292
01:19:13.551 --> 01:19:16.100
I don't know if it's cause they wearing tight jeans and they tuck their shirts

1293
01:19:16.101 --> 01:19:16.940
in him,
but I'm telling you,

1294
01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.060
they're going to have weight problems when they get older.
You can see it.

1295
01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.470
They can see the Krispy Kreme,
you know,
they're going to be doing those.

1296
01:19:24.471 --> 01:19:28.370
Where are they now?
And then they're going to come on stream screening,
but they,

1297
01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:32.030
oh my God,
what happened?
And that guy,
I can't believe how big his head is.

1298
01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:37.040
All right.
Um,
what am I going,

1299
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:38.780
uh,

1300
01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.210
Japanese baseball players though?
This is the guy right in back.
Okay,
here we go.

1301
01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:48.710
Um,
overrated Dave Matthews band concerts.

1302
01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:54.350
Wait,
did I read the shit last week?
No,
I don't think I did.

1303
01:19:54.351 --> 01:19:57.440
Dave Matthews band concert,
which is a way of time to say that because,
uh,

1304
01:19:57.950 --> 01:20:00.230
the saxophone player passed away.

1305
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:05.750
Just brutal cause he died on an ATV accident as you want to buy a dirt bike too.

1306
01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:10.860
So I kind of freaked me.
Uh,
I went,
wait a minute.
I swear to God,

1307
01:20:10.861 --> 01:20:15.290
I read this last week.
Overrated.
Have you ever performed,
Oh,

1308
01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.970
here's a question.
You've never performed anywhere in upstate New York.

1309
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.050
You're in New York City all the time,
but I've never seen you play all many.

1310
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.000
I've actually played Albany.

1311
01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:28.290
I plated on the Montreal Comedy Festival tour

1312
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.660
and we did,
uh,
we,
we played at the egg,

1313
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:39.750
which is a theater up there.
He played at the egg and a,
it was cool.

1314
01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:43.140
It's definitely cool,
but I think I did some sort of club up there,

1315
01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:44.820
but it was a long time ago.
I gotta tell you something.

1316
01:20:44.821 --> 01:20:49.821
I've driven the 87 north out of New York so many times that I get sick to my

1317
01:20:49.891 --> 01:20:50.880
stomach when I do it.

1318
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.570
And that's why I never played Syracuse or Albany or Poughkeepsie.

1319
01:20:55.410 --> 01:21:00.230
Um,
my agent was telling me that I might be going there soon,
so,
um,

1320
01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:04.860
I didn't mind nobody.
I didn't love it.
It seems like a lonely,

1321
01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:07.990
forgotten city though,
you know,
to be the capital city.

1322
01:21:07.991 --> 01:21:09.810
It's kind of like Sacramento in California.

1323
01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.890
That's a weird thing with states where like Illinois,

1324
01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:17.700
where you think Chicago would be the Capitol Capitol,
but it's Springfield,

1325
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:23.160
Springfield and then Michigan.
What do you think it is?
You think it's Detroit?

1326
01:21:23.161 --> 01:21:26.360
It isn't a toy and saying,
you know,

1327
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.840
like Massachusetts is Boston.
Did you know what it is?

1328
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:36.110
It just really shows you how a city used to be the place to be.

1329
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:41.280
And then another city just took it over like I've been,
Albany was unbelievable.

1330
01:21:41.281 --> 01:21:44.130
And like 1840,
you know what I mean?

1331
01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:48.900
A bunch of chicks walking around just twirling their umbrellas and stuff.
But uh,

1332
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:53.130
it's over.
Same thing with like Pennsylvania.
There's another one.

1333
01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.850
Do you think it would be Philadelphia or Pittsburgh?
Harrisburg,

1334
01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:01.740
you know,
Maryland.
It's not Baltimore,

1335
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:04.430
Annapolis where things are,

1336
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.110
and I'm showing you how much I've done the road that I actually know this shit.

1337
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:11.940
Um,
all right.
There's a couple more questions here,

1338
01:22:11.941 --> 01:22:15.690
but I've got to get on my flight here,
so I apologize for cutting it short.

1339
01:22:15.691 --> 01:22:18.240
I'll read those other questions the next week.
Once again,
everybody,

1340
01:22:18.241 --> 01:22:21.660
thank you for listening to my podcast.
Please,
please watch my special this week.

1341
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:26.140
Why do I do this?
Comedy central 11:00 PM.
Uh,

1342
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.440
and uh,
I think that's it.

1343
01:22:28.441 --> 01:22:33.441
This week I'll be at the stress factory in New Jersey and after that I will be

1344
01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:41.430
at the,
uh,
I'm doing umass Amherst and Massachusetts,
Amherst,

1345
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:44.280
Massachusetts with Charlene Murphy the next weekend.

1346
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:47.580
I'm doing the punchline at San Francisco.
The weekend after that,

1347
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.470
I'm doing the funny bone in Richmond,
Virginia,
so if you want to,
I want,

1348
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.110
I got a new website coming up this week,
hopefully.
Um,

1349
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.510
so I take one last look at the old bill burns calm because the new one's coming.

1350
01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.950
All right.
Thanks to everybody who podcasts.

1351
01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.440
<v 3>What's your finger?</v>
