It's almost Friday.
Ah,

You're going to get dead fucking checked at fucking Douche is going to come by

6
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:32.150

right?
Poke his head and your cubicle.

7
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.620
Wait a fucking envelope down.
Right?

8
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.710
And he's going to be talking you and you're not going to hear him.

9
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:42.380
You just going to be sitting this smile.
Or maybe it's a lady.

10
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.640
Maybe it's the web woman.
Maybe she's coming along with their sensible shoes.

11
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:51.110
You know,
she doesn't have a heel on it,
right?
She's taking it back.

12
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.480
You know,
tell me what to do with my body.

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.540
How come guys don't have to walk around in high heels?

14
00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:00.740
Why do women have to ruin their feet and they're fucking lower backs?
You know,

15
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.740
that's like one of those fucking stories that like with this stupid ass fucking

16
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.550
election would actually become like a national story,
some dumb shit like that,

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.250
you know,
complete fucking clickbait horse shit.
Who gives a fuck?

18
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.130
You know,
I dunno.

19
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.160
I Dunno how people sit down and watch these conventions my entire life.

20
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:28.340
I've never been able to get through one.
They are so fucking cringeworthy.

21
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.140
It's so phony.
It's so fake.
The fucking smiles,

22
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:37.640
those maniacal,
Eh,
like just totally in your head.

23
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.360
You know the candidates at this point,

24
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.450
they have to be completely fucking exhausted.

25
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.470
They don't want to answer any more fucking questions and they still have like

26
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:53.420
another 90 days of this shit that they have to go through.
You know,

27
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.930
you know,
like when a team goes to the Superbowl,
right?

28
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.890
And you've got the two weeks right before and they just fucking sit there.

29
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:05.120
All fucking they report is run out of questions and they're just sitting there.

30
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.880
That's two weeks of that shit in those players.
They go nuts.

31
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:12.881
Just doing that is fucking Kobo over guy fucking my Yana for it's only eight 30

32
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:16.490
at night.
This is fucking calm over dude in the clam there.

33
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.100
They just keep answering the same fucking questions.

34
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.180
It's going to be easier for Trump.
You know what I mean?

35
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:24.950
He just has to just make up some shit.

36
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.170
Listening to Trump give his speech is no different than fucking listen to me do

37
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:34.040
this podcast.

38
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:38.360
He might as well just be laying there and his fucking underwear is fucking boxes

39
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:41.740
and just talking to the American people,
just whatever the fuck he's thinking.

40
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.580
He just says it and then like fucking,
you know,
whatever.

41
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:48.950
20 minutes later somebody corrects him on Twitter.

42
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.800
That APP has been all the time.
Every time I put out a podcast,
somebody goes,

43
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:55.400
hey man,
not trying to be a dick,
but just let you know.
You know?

44
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.160
You know,
the George Bush thing,

45
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.730
I thought they were just making fun of George Bush dance and I didn't know he

46
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.680
was doing it at the fucking,
it's some,
you know,

47
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.460
the police officer's funerals and memorial service.
You know,

48
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.910
I thought Lewis Hamilton was the upstart driver.
They're like,
no,

49
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.370
it's actually Nico Rosberg since every fucking week I'd do that,

50
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:16.690
but I'm just some shithead.
I'm not actually running for office.
Um,

51
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.470
oh,
you're not bill.
Thank you for bringing that up.
We didn't fucking realize it.

52
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.730
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
yeah,
you,

53
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:27.970
you truly are a fucking patriot.
If you could sit through those things,

54
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:32.440
especially this election.
Cause uh,
I see.
I can't fucking do it.
I can't,

55
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.490
uh,
oh my God.
Rudy Giuliani,
God I,

56
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.890
how many fucking was going off Jesus Christ.
What the fuck was he?

57
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.920
What was going on with them?
I love always voice kept going up.

58
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.680
Like he thought the crowd was going to go with them and they didn't really,

59
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:48.730
they kept clapping,

60
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.990
but he kept increasing his energy and his passion and nothing happened.

61
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.810
At least when Howard Dean got going crazy,
when,
hey,

62
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.160
when he did that thing that he was reacting to the energy,

63
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:03.940
at least he was fucking connected to those people.
Rudy,

64
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:06.210
I don't know what he was doing.
Yeah.

65
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.780
I'll tell you the worst fucking image you could ever picture is Rudy Giuliani,

66
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:13.060
Bang and Hillary Clinton.
I mean,

67
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:17.080
just imagine that with his fucking that look on his face when he was screaming

68
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.070
about the cops.

69
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.420
And then Hillary when she fucking does that smile where eyes get all wide.

70
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.810
All right,
I'm going to ruin your fucking day.
Picture her bent over.

71
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:30.270
Put the fucking eyes all wide net crazy smile and hid behind like I jacked guy

72
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.040
guy just fucking banging away.
There you go.

73
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.450
That's on your fucking hard drive.
Now.
You can never erase that.

74
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.070
Um,
oh shit.
Look at me.
They're just there.

75
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.770
It's another one for the MMP fucking Photoshop right there.

76
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.420
I looked for that one tomorrow on fucking,
I guess today,

77
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.860
if you listen to it tomorrow for me on the old fucking Twitter,

78
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.960
Twitter sphere.
Um,
I had such a great time this week.
You know,

79
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.190
not having to go in the fucking writer's room has been awesome.
Uh,

80
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.020
getting caught up in all the shit,
you know,

81
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.840
around the house and all that type of stuff.
It's just,
it's just a fucking,

82
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.460
only being a comedian is the greatest fucking job.

83
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.110
It's the greatest fucking job you could ever fucking half just go on stage,

84
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.520
act like a fucking idiot.

85
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.890
And then afterwards hang out with a bunch of co comics and then you go,
Oh,

86
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.500
then you wait 24 hours,
do it all over again,

87
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.410
apologize for the yarn.
And all of a sudden,
um,
you know,
I dunno,

88
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.840
there's just something about listening to my voice.
It just puts me to sleep.

89
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.670
That's how I got to sleep every night,
you know?

90
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:44.410
Then I just start talking out loud,
you know,
I'm saying.

91
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.200
And in the rain,
just st 20 minutes later,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm asleep.
Um,

92
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.710
anyway,
so Monday night,

93
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.520
as I mentioned last week I did a,

94
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.800
I was going to be doing the goddamn comedy jam and a,

95
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.330
I busted out the old fucking John Bonham get up.
And,
uh,

96
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.620
for the first time ever I played my Ludwig 71 green sparkle fucking kit,

97
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.950
add my,
my drum teacher swung by the house.

98
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.490
He tuned the fucking things up so they sounded great.
And I'm like,

99
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:14.870
I don't know how they're going to sound in the room.

100
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.430
The fucking two year anniversary of Josh Adam Meyers show the Goddamn comedy
jam,

101
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.610
uh,
which is now become a fucking pilot on comedy central.

102
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:25.520
The show is just blowing up.
So happy for all those guys.
Uh,

103
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.690
they had it at the Roxy down on sunset strip.
Now

104
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.830
you got to understand,
I am a Phi came of age in the fucking eighties.

105
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.510
Uh,
meaning I didn't get laid till the 90s.

106
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

107
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.650
<v 0>Um,
anyway,
yeah,
it was a hotel.
It was a rough one for me.
Right.</v>

108
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.740
But basically I'm the fucking,

109
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.550
just the bands that were going on that were,
you know,

110
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.080
the sunset strip was total the fucking hair metal.
You know,

111
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.830
the beginning of the metal with fucking a Randy Rhodes,
you know,

112
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:05.560
when he joined Ozzy and all,
all those fucking guys,

113
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.580
and then it went into the hair metal and then guns and roses pulled that out in

114
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:13.510
the end and then fucking,
uh,
who Kay Warren and all those guys,

115
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:18.511
all of that shit happened on the sunset strip out here in fucking la.

116
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:23.950
And I used to always read about the whiskey,
the Roxy,
the rain ballroom.
You know,

117
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:26.740
back when I used to read,
hit fucking per ray.

118
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.780
Anybody used to read hit parade,
a magazine.
I fucking love that magazine,

119
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.363
you know?

120
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.190
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.950
<v 0>They used to put all the curse words in there and everything.
I would,</v>

122
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.431
you know what?

123
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:42.431
I would actually buy one of those off of fucking Ebay just to read it,

124
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:45.800
just to see.
I already read about all of those fucking bands.

125
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:49.280
I knew everybody's name.
I knew the names of every fucking drummer.

126
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.120
I used to watch all the videos.
I used to watch the headbangers ball,

127
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.800
Randy Rockman.
I used to watch the top 10 countdown.
That was hilarious.

128
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:00.380
It was either like Janet Jackson or some hair metal.

129
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.400
I used to think Janet Jackson was,
was was like fucking pussy music.

130
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.190
But these guys who will wear lipstick and had their hair,

131
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.990
I'll tee stuff like some desperate soccer mom trying to fall in the last dick of

132
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.750
a life.
I thought that that was fucking guide music.
You know,

133
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.790
Britny Fox.
I've always brought that up.
The girls school,
all that Shit,

134
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.403
you know.

135
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.640
<v 1>Okay</v>

136
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.390
<v 0>poison.
Every rose has it's thorn,
all of that Shit.
Right.</v>

137
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.490
I got into,
I was into all of that.
Then I started working in a warehouse and uh,

138
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.670
I worked with these fucking burnouts that were,
they weren't burnouts,

139
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.290
they've smoked weed,
but my world,

140
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.300
that meant you were fucking burnout out back then,
you know,

141
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:41.570
cause back then that was considered was bad.
If you smoke weed,
it was illegal.

142
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.290
We didn't realize that it actually helped with you fucking memory back then.

143
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:48.050
We thought that not your memory,
it helps with Alzheimer's,

144
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:49.850
whatever the fuck that claim and who knows.

145
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.980
<v 0>You know,
the whole fucking weed thing,
it's,
it's,</v>

147
00:08:52.981 --> 00:08:55.080
it's like the global warming battle.
I just,

148
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.300
it's going to go back and forth and back and forth.

149
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:02.430
And then eventually booze bags like myself will finally give and be like,

150
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.940
all right,
all right,
you guys were right about the we kind of way people,

151
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:09.120
all the corporations finally went like,
ah,
you know what,
Eh,

152
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.510
global warming is happening and it is because of us,
but a,
you know,

153
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.250
it's too late to fix it now.

154
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.980
Um,
so I started working with these guys and they,
uh,

155
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.230
played in a band and like I came from more of a jock town.
Right?

156
00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:27.620
Everybody just fucking played sports or you just,
you know,
I don't know.

157
00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:30.830
Stood in the corner on a fucking wall during a party,
you know,

158
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.940
it was basically it.
Those are your only two options town I was in.
And uh,

159
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.880
these kids were from a couple towns over and everybody over there and play

160
00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:40.760
played instruments and these guys came,
I worked with them.

161
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:42.860
They were playing guitar and they playing the shit that was on the radio.

162
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:47.270
And I didn't,
I,
I didn't.
They were all my agents and he could fucking get that.

163
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:50.390
Good.
That's amazing.
And that's right.
Then when I bought my first drum kit,

164
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.220
it brought out I was 20 years old when I started playing fucking drums.

165
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.780
I haven't done everything late in life.
I was always fucking,

166
00:09:56.781 --> 00:10:00.790
I had day late and a fucking dollar short.
Right.
And,
um,

167
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.010
I had this,

168
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.930
I bought a five piece Slingerland kit at the time it was,

169
00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:11.590
I bought it in 1988,
I think,
and it was like 10 years old.

170
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.210
It was all Bonham sizes,
but it was more like the five ply once.

171
00:10:16.211 --> 00:10:18.060
It wasn't a three ply shelves.
So it was,

172
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.330
they were already starting to fucking make them too heavy.
But,
uh,
it was,
uh,

173
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.830
black and it had a,
Oh God,
I can't remember the fucking sizes.

174
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.980
It was,
Whoa,
it had an 18 inch floor,
Tom,
a 24 inch kick.

175
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.380
And then what the fuck was the rack?
I think it was like a 13.

176
00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:43.260
It was really weird sizes.
And then later I ended up,

177
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.740
I went down to Al Drewes,
this shop in Woonsocket,
Rhode Island,

178
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:50.040
I believe that's where it was.
And I found a 16 inch floor Tom,

179
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.560
which was fucking unbelievable.
That matched my kit.
Even the badges said Niles,

180
00:10:54.561 --> 00:10:57.720
Chicago,
Niles,
Illinois.
Sorry.
MMM.

181
00:10:59.060 --> 00:10:59.893
<v 1>And</v>

182
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.690
<v 0>you know,
there was no fucking Ebay back then.
I didn't know he,</v>

183
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.930
there was no way to track down all of this shit that people had lying around the

184
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:08.490
house.
I just went into that place.

185
00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:11.310
They had all these old drums and they happen to have that and I fucking bought

186
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:15.920
that.
Yeah.
Dang.
I was nine by 13,
10 by 14,
13,

187
00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:20.600
14 and 18 and a 24 kicks.
So then I got the six 16 inch.

188
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.660
So now I add,
um,
I had a six piece kit,

189
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:27.190
which I thought was the shit.
Then I got some Roto,

190
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.080
Tom's put them on the other side of the high hat cause I was watching Alex van

191
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.290
Halen cause it was all about having the biggest fucking kitchen could possibly

192
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:35.124
have.

193
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.380
And then along came out guns and roses and a guy named Steven Adler and he

194
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:43.680
showed up a little four piece kit,
right rack,
Tom floor,

195
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:46.230
Tom and his fucking ride sitting in between the two,

196
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.560
which was just shit.
And he got more music out of that.

197
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:54.670
Then half these fucking guys with double bass drum kicks to Tom's above each

198
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:58.240
base drama,
two floor toms.
Right.
And um,

199
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.830
<v 1>okay.</v>

200
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.080
<v 0>That just completely changed my life.
So long story short,</v>

201
00:12:03.081 --> 00:12:05.420
I used to always read up on all that.
I try to do,

202
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.760
I'll try to figure out how to spin the sticks,
all of that shit.

203
00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:11.750
And back in the day all I could do was watch MTV and try to figure this shit
out.

204
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:13.430
Or You just listened to the records.

205
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.700
And we had an even better than the kids in the 70s because there was no fucking

206
00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:18.810
MTV.
Maybe he caught him on a,
I don't know,

207
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.800
Dick Clark fucking show with some shit.
So,

208
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.170
but all you stab you hear about was,
you know,

209
00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:29.120
if you wanted to fucking make it in rock music back then you had to be down

210
00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:32.570
there.
So here we are,
fucking almost Jesus Christ.
30 years later,

211
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.120
I finally get the fucking go down there on a Monday night and I got to play

212
00:12:38.121 --> 00:12:41.990
drums at the Roxy was,
was fucking incredible.
And I sucked.

213
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.300
When we practice,
like on Thursday,

214
00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:48.530
I sucked on Sunday and then during sound check I was only okay.
And I was like,

215
00:12:48.531 --> 00:12:50.990
God damn it.
I had all these friends come it down and go,

216
00:12:50.991 --> 00:12:53.870
wouldn't you fucking know cause you know I hadn't played and played since March

217
00:12:53.871 --> 00:12:57.980
and I'm a comedian,
so I already sucked even when I was playing.
And uh,

218
00:12:57.981 --> 00:12:59.180
so went out,
did my set,

219
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:03.050
dressed his fucking bottom and I sat down behind the kit and I don't know what

220
00:13:03.051 --> 00:13:06.590
happened.
I just took it,
I don't know,
just kind of Ah,
fuck it.
Right.

221
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.480
And I ended up playing for me.
I played great.
I the most fun.

222
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.440
I was the loosest that I've ever been at a,
it was fucking hilarious of playing

223
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.140
the song.
And uh,
Dave Cushner who,
uh,

224
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:26.170
does the music for a f is for family and also was in velvet revolver.

225
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.940
He was playing the song too when he always,
you know,

226
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.800
fucking around and shit makes me laugh.

227
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:33.830
So I had this stupid fake mustache glued to my upper lip.

228
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.940
Eddie was making me laugh and I knew I couldn't smile.
It was going to come off.

229
00:13:37.941 --> 00:13:40.050
So then half of it was fucking flapping.

230
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.100
He started laughing and then the thing literally floated off my face and we're

231
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:47.270
only halfway through the first song.

232
00:13:47.271 --> 00:13:50.510
And then I had this stupid bad Dan around the fucking John Bonam wig.

233
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.090
That thing came off.
Then the hair was in my face.

234
00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:57.050
I look like the chick from the ring and my sunglasses started fogging up.

235
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.770
So it's funny,
I was,

236
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.330
I was on a green sparkled kid dressed as John Bonam when we were playing ACDC.

237
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.850
None of it made sense.
So of course it was,
you know,
working,

238
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.910
cause you know,
we just fucking around.

239
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.270
So then we did highway to hell and in the end that was the encore.

240
00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:17.210
We did highway to hell.
And then everybody,
we are bringing everybody out.

241
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.770
Bert Kreischer,
um,
who fucking destroyed.
He opened,

242
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.240
he did a red hot chili peppers.
Give it away now.

243
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.790
And not only did he come out just wearing the sock,

244
00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:32.390
he talked to everybody in the band into doing that.
Um,

245
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.290
I was not out there for that.
And,
uh,
then Margaret showing up,

246
00:14:36.291 --> 00:14:38.520
she fucking killed it.
Uh,

247
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.310
Harlan Williams saying eyes without a face.
He fucking killed it.

248
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.850
And,
uh,

249
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.850
then Ron white went up and sang Leonard skittered get me three steps.

250
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:54.980
I hope somebody took video of this shit.
So I had to follow all of that.

251
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.820
And uh,
fortunately,
uh,
it was a great crowd.
And uh,
so anyway,

252
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:01.340
so in the end they brought everybody out to sing highway to hell and they kept

253
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:04.820
me on drums.
By then my hairs,
that wig is in the face.

254
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.010
I can't see through the fucking sunglasses.

255
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.630
And in the end they just wanted me to keep doing like the symbol wash thing as

256
00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:13.870
the introduced everybody,
you know,

257
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.360
another round of applause for everybody and I forgot and I couldn't see.

258
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:20.000
So I kind of stopped playing and I kept hearing the guitars.

259
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.070
It was a cluster fuck,
but it was hilarious and a,

260
00:15:23.071 --> 00:15:26.180
I want to thank everybody that came out and um,

261
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.060
I have to tell you that's the best sounding fucking drum kit I've ever played in

262
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:36.980
my life.
26 inch bass drum.
And the way my teacher,

263
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.300
uh,
tuned it up and the way they miked it up,
it sounded fucking unbelievable.

264
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:44.190
And what I loved was everyone in the band was saying how great the fucking kid

265
00:15:44.191 --> 00:15:48.450
sounded.
And uh,
I dunno,

266
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.530
I have to figure out,

267
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.710
I swear to God I have to figure out a place where I can just set that fucking

268
00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:58.010
thing up.
That's the goal.

269
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:00.920
That's what sucks about having a fucking does no place to play.

270
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.530
When you play drums,
you have a fucking guitar,

271
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:06.570
you can turn down your ramp is no way to do it.
And you know,

272
00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:09.800
it was fun as those electronic kits are,
I know I'm just talking drums on this,

273
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:13.340
but who gives a shit?
I barely ever talk this much about drums.

274
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.400
They got these drums.
Like if you live in an apartment,
right?
The way it goes,

275
00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:23.060
if you still want to play is you buy a set of v Drums,
all right?

276
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:26.240
Those are the best electronic drums as far as I'm concerned,
that are out there.

277
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:29.690
You buy that mid level one,
so it's not that much money.

278
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.820
There's always ones used on Ebay.

279
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.210
And then what I used to do was I would put foam down on the floor than just

280
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:42.140
build the little two by fours and plywood.
Just build a little drum riser,

281
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.600
okay?
Put carpet on that form and then another layer of carpet.
Okay?

282
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.360
And then you put the drums on top of that,

283
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.960
and then what you do is you go downstairs and you meet your neighbor.

284
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.600
You tell him,
hey,
I played drums.
I'll only play during,
this is what I used to.

285
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.570
I say,
I'm stand up.
I worked nights,
all right,
I'll play during the day.

286
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.840
Only Monday through Friday if I'm going to play.
I played during the day.

287
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.900
If whatever reason,
if you're ever home during those times,

288
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:13.310
here's my phone number.
Just call this number and I will immediately stop.

289
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.100
I mean that's,
that's just the best you could fucking do.

290
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:18.650
I told this story before,
then the guy ends up being a cunt,

291
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.733
<v 1>you know,</v>

292
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.640
<v 0>one time out of the 5,000 times I played,</v>

293
00:17:24.641 --> 00:17:29.641
he ended up being home sick or some shit or he had a vacation and he called up,

294
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.820
right.
I pick up the phone,
I'm like,
hello.
And he just goes,
can you knock it off?

295
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

296
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.830
<v 0>Like right out of the fucking gate.</v>

297
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

298
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.810
<v 0>And I was like,
all right,
Jesus,
quite I was,
I was younger then.</v>

299
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.330
Now it would have been like,
dude,
hey.
Yeah,
you don't fucking say that.

300
00:17:43.331 --> 00:17:47.440
Like you said it to me 50 fucking times.
You can't,
I gave you my number.

301
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.280
I couldn't be any nicer.
Right.
I'm going to stop,

302
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:53.350
but go fuck yourself and please call me again if I bug you.

303
00:17:53.351 --> 00:17:56.370
And I would have laughed at them and I would have left it at that.
But anyways,

304
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.263
um,

305
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:58.200
<v 1>yeah,</v>

306
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.260
<v 0>three Olli is,
is you're not playing drums if you're on an electronic kit.</v>

307
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.780
I can't explain it.
It's weird because if you play an electric guitar,

308
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:04.800
you really playing guitar.

309
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.420
But there's just something about those electronic drums.
I Dunno.
I think,

310
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.180
I think most dramas would agree with me.
There's something that you play.

311
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.660
You can sit down on electronic drums and you're like,
I,

312
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.990
how have I not fucking toward the world is one of the greatest drummers of all

313
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:25.410
time.
This sounds,
I sound incredible on this fucking thing.

314
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.200
And then what happens is then you sit down,

315
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.850
bind a real kit and you actually have to make the sound happen rather than just

316
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:36.840
fucking hidden somewhere on the pad and getting a nice snare sound or fucking

317
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.810
bass drum.
Then all of a sudden you get on a real kit.
You're like,
oh,

318
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:42.660
that's right.
That's right.

319
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.970
I'm not one of the greatest drummers of all time.
It's the exact opposite.

320
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.330
I'm one of the worst fucking drummers that ever fucking lived.

321
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.730
This is an embarrassment.

322
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.990
I should be on an electronic kit cause at least so she could turn down.
Um,

323
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.660
so anyways,
um,

324
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.300
<v 1>okay.</v>

325
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.140
<v 0>I can't stop thinking of how fucking unbelievable those fucking drum sounded.</v>

326
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.960
I'll do they sound,
it's so fucking good in,
in between.

327
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.880
We played if you want blood and then when they bring in everybody out,
like

328
00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.930
I was just,
I,
I still had to keep playing them.
They sounded so fucking good.

329
00:19:17.931 --> 00:19:22.730
Play to that beginning beat to in my time of dying back bed to do well but don't

330
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.560
get it.
They just found it.
Oh the son of fucking amazing.
That's killing me.

331
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.020
I swear to God,
I swear to God.

332
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.410
Why the fuck did I build a gym out of my well,

333
00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:37.250
cause I didn't want to be a fat fuck cause that'd be hilarious if I built a drum

334
00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:39.680
room instead and I put those things out there,
nobody get hurt.

335
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.410
And then I did work out and I got fat and I started looking.

336
00:19:42.411 --> 00:19:45.140
You ever see those awful pictures of John Bonham when he had the fucking wife

337
00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:49.040
Beater on Jesus Christ and he's like 27 years old back then.

338
00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:53.430
Like people just looked so fucking old.
I don't know why.

339
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.960
I don't know what was going on back in the day,
you know,

340
00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.460
like they just showed that fucking lunatic,
that fucking lunatic.

341
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.060
John Hinckley who shot Ronald Reagan.

342
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

343
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:11.070
<v 0>Shod.
Brady in the head totally altered that guy's life.
Quality of life.</v>

344
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.300
I forget how many fucking people he's shut.
They just let that guy out and oh,

345
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:15.841
by the way,

346
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:20.250
he was obsessed with Jodie foster cause he kept watching her and taxi and uh,

347
00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:23.790
yeah,
I think she was like 13 years old in that fucking thing.
Yeah,

348
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:27.510
let's let that guy out that,
that's a good thing to do.

349
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.390
Jesus fucking Christ.
The guy's been in there for 35 fucking years.

350
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:34.290
What's he going to do?

351
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.320
You're going to go go work at one of those yogurt shops.
I mean what,

352
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:40.500
what exactly is

353
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.340
the guy has no fucking resume.

354
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

355
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.130
<v 0>You,
you don't do,
you can imagine</v>

356
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.980
<v 1>that guy's fucking resume.
What it must be like.
It would just be like,
all right.</v>

357
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.760
He,
Mr Hinckley,

358
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:59.170
let's see here in a c was 25 when he got arrested.

359
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.670
1980,
81.
Let's see.
So let's just say,
let's say he was a go getter.

360
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:06.970
He got his first job at 16.
So he would have had nine years on his resume.

361
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:13.090
That takes us back to about,
uh,
about 1972,
let's see,
in 1972,

362
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:17.770
a,
you had a job stocking shelves in a grocery store.

363
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:21.820
He did that for a couple of years.
Uh,

364
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:25.150
you got a job at a bowling alley.
It's going to be all 70 shit,
right?

365
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.650
<v 0>And uh,
then you shot the president</v>

366
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.880
and then there's a,
what's it 35 year gap.

367
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:41.710
Okay.
Shot the president.
1981.

368
00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:45.880
And now you,
uh,
you want to work here at staples.

369
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.570
Tell you what,
we're going to put this in the bin.

370
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.890
I'm going to have a manager look at it.

371
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.460
I want to thank you for coming in and not,
no,
no,
no,
don't,

372
00:21:53.461 --> 00:21:56.320
there's no reason to contact us.
We'll uh,

373
00:21:56.321 --> 00:22:00.640
we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
I don't understand that.

374
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:02.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

375
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.470
<v 0>This is what I think they should do.
They should fucking transfer it.</v>

376
00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:10.800
Hinckley to wherever the fuck John Charlie Manson is.

377
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.173
All right.

378
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.130
Then you stick them in side by side cells and then they just host a reality
show.

379
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.241
You don't.

380
00:22:18.241 --> 00:22:21.420
Neither one of them is seeing the outside world for roughly the same time.

381
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.810
Whatever Charlie Manson's got like 10 12 years on it.
But at that point,

382
00:22:24.811 --> 00:22:28.460
once you up to 35 fucking years,
you know,
Oh,
I've been in for 47 years.

383
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.890
That doesn't fucking make a difference.
All right?

384
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.960
You just have just fucking talk locally,

385
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.290
locally and just have him talk about just,
you know,
random shit.

386
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.160
You just show them a video.
Give him a little glimpse of the outside world.
Hey,

387
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.960
Charlie Manson.
What'd you think about lady Gaga is meat dress?
You know,

388
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.890
whatever the fuck's going on in the world.
I don't know.
All right,

389
00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:50.790
that's a bad idea.

390
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.463
<v 1>Okay.</v>

391
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.260
<v 0>It was that a good reality show.</v>

392
00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:01.490
We've taken some of the most infamous criminals of the past 50 years,

393
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.760
stuck them all in a circle of cells and your eyes won't believe what happens

394
00:23:09.001 --> 00:23:10.700
next.
Um,

395
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.860
you know what's funny is I could probably get to at least a second level of

396
00:23:13.861 --> 00:23:18.861
pitching that show strong interest before the whole thing fell apart and they

397
00:23:18.871 --> 00:23:19.800
realized like,
well,
wait a minute.

398
00:23:19.801 --> 00:23:22.390
How the fuck are we going to get transferred this guy to the other prison.
Ah,

399
00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:25.650
the overhead's too high,
you know?
All right.

400
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.220
There's always a moment with every podcast where it goes off the fucking rails.

401
00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:31.620
And I'm going to go out on a limb and say,
it's this moment right here.

402
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.180
This is the moment right now where I wonder what the fuck am I gonna talk about

403
00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:37.014
next?

404
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.400
Do that guy 60 fucking years old now.

405
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:47.710
He spent from 25 to years old in a fucking nuthouse and they're gonna if they

406
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.200
gonna let him out.
Now

407
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.210
we're fucking job.
[inaudible] is a 60 year old.
Yeah,

408
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:02.600
you got any yard computer skills.
He sitting there.
Now what are those?

409
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:07.550
I mean those giant things from the $6 million man now.
Now they're like,
dig you.

410
00:24:07.551 --> 00:24:10.460
They wait like fucking three pounds.
Now.
You know,

411
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.760
he probably thinks it's a plastic book.

412
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.330
Um,
I don't know what they said.
They're going to fucking try to monitor this guy.

413
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:26.120
What the fuck is wrong with it?
I just,
I don't understand it

414
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.290
or understand that.
I think it is another thing too.

415
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:32.870
If you're going to fucking give a guy 35 fucking years,

416
00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:35.960
just put them out of his fucking misery.
Right.

417
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:43.470
Wow.
What would you rather do?
Would you rather spend 30 years in a 35 years?

418
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:48.500
25 to 60 no one had 60 you getting out or they can give you the old right there.

419
00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:51.720
Fred,
you know your choice.

420
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.850
I think I choose a firing squad fire to go out.

421
00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.720
Fucking get electrocuted,
you know?

422
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.190
Or have you put me down like some old collie with little fucking injection.

423
00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:07.320
I don't want that shit.
Who would want that?
I don't

424
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.490
just fucking have me in front of a firing squad.
Right?

425
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:18.520
Hey can we not the face just fucking center mass.
Boom.
Done over.
All right.

426
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.630
Here we go.
Did I mention,

427
00:25:19.631 --> 00:25:22.930
I can't remember cause I started this podcast a couple of times here that I

428
00:25:22.931 --> 00:25:26.410
mentioned.
I got some new dates coming up.
Okay.

429
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.540
I've mentioned the European dates.

430
00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:32.170
I got some new dates coming up that are going on sale this Friday and I'm very

431
00:25:32.171 --> 00:25:34.870
excited about this because these are the shows.

432
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:39.460
These are the shows that I'm doing is I'm getting ready to do my fifth hour long

433
00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:43.870
stand up special.
Very proud of that.
My five year five special anniversary.

434
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.440
Okay,

437
00:25:57.301 --> 00:26:02.301
This is the makeup show for that show that I canceled a due to weather out on

438
00:26:02.501 --> 00:26:07.360
long island,
um,
earlier this year.
Back in January,
I believe.

439
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.840
I'm finally making that one up.

440
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.130
And then on September 8th,
I'm in,
uh,

441
00:26:15.131 --> 00:26:19.510

445
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.700
let's see,
the next weekend I'm swimming with great white sharks.

446
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:44.040
I'll tell you about that later of Jesus getting over a fear.

447
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.920
Stupid Thursday,
September 29th,
I'm in Madison,

448
00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:53.430
Wisconsin at the Orpheum theater.
October 1st.

449
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.030
Holy fucking shit.
Okay.

450
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.810
Does that say all Maha Nebraska?

451
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.400
It's just going to be my triumphant return to no,

452
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:07.120
I have not been in Nebraska since.
Yeah.
Since I was always doing college cakes.

453
00:27:07.121 --> 00:27:11.270
I don't,
I can't remember the last time I was there.
The Orpheum theater.

454
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.620
Okay.
That's going down on October 1st all right.

455
00:27:15.621 --> 00:27:17.240
This is when we're getting down to crunch time.

456
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:22.190
We're getting closer to the special Thursday,
October 6th I'm in Atlanta,

457
00:27:22.191 --> 00:27:26.180
Georgia at the Fox theater Friday at top.

458
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.350
October 7th I'm in Gainesville,
Florida.
All right.

459
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.520
What the fuck?
What a God damn Yankee like me be doing down in Gainesville,

460
00:27:34.521 --> 00:27:38.990
Florida and Friday,
October 7th.
Well,
I'll tell you what,
boy,
out to tell you what.

461
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.460
Yeah,

462
00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.900
that's because on October 8th the Lsu Tigers are playing the Florida gators down

463
00:27:44.901 --> 00:27:48.880
there on the swamp.
I cannot fucking wait to go to that game.
Uh,

464
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.630
I love both those programs and a,

465
00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:53.570
I've always been a dream of mine as a sports fan to always to go into that

466
00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:57.560
stadium before they tear it down.
He gave him some new flashy new one that,
fuck,

467
00:27:57.561 --> 00:28:00.680
it looks like everybody else's.
I just want to see the layout,

468
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.910
like that whole section of that weird wall where it just says the swamp.

469
00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:08.420
Like what the fuck was that one of those multipurpose stadiums that they,

470
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.840
they used to be able to spin it around and to make it a baseball diamond.

471
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.680
And then after awhile it just broke and they said,
fuck it.
It's a football field.

472
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.470
I have no idea.
But I want to go see that.

473
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.070
A very unique looking stadium and their fans are fucking awesome.

474
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.910
And a as it's SCC football.
And then from a Saturday,

475
00:28:25.911 --> 00:28:28.130
October 15th to Thursday,

476
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:33.200
October 20th I'm going to be in Washington DC at the national theatre.

477
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.420
Now what's great about that is,
uh,

478
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.040
I'll be doing probably a couple shows at night.
Oh,
it's a theater.
Oh No,
actually,

479
00:28:40.041 --> 00:28:42.320
no.
Maybe I'll just be doing one at night.
I don't know what I'm gonna be doing,

480
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.090
but I'm,
that's the crunch time.
I'm working every single of Saturday,

481
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:51.050
Sunday,
Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
doing a little residency,

482
00:28:51.051 --> 00:28:55.640
I believe is what they call before I get ready to do my special.
And,
um,

483
00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.010
I never write my shit down and this time there's a few things that I think I'm

484
00:29:01.011 --> 00:29:05.150
actually gonna try writing out and then improving on it and just seeing how it

485
00:29:05.151 --> 00:29:07.460
goes on this special just to try something different.
You know,

486
00:29:07.461 --> 00:29:08.810
I'm always trying to do something a little different.

487
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:13.520
Kippy giving you the same old bill every fucking special.
Right.
So,
uh,

488
00:29:13.521 --> 00:29:18.350
I'm very excited about that.
Uh,
I'm ridiculously excited about the,

489
00:29:18.351 --> 00:29:21.830
uh,
European tour coming up,

490
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.520
not excited about the long flight and um,

491
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.590
you know,
the lovely Nia will not be going with me to those fucking shows.

492
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.510
I'm just doing it cause it's a thrash.

493
00:29:32.511 --> 00:29:36.590
I mean it's all right for me cause I get that they at the high doing the show,

494
00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:40.030
but she's just going to be getting fucking,
hey,
you like this city.
All right.

495
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.710
Is another one you every fucking day.
I think that would get a little old,
but uh,

496
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.900
so any who um,
I think that's it,
right?

497
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:52.750
Does that my little half hour did I do my little fucking penance for the week

498
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:57.370
here?
Huh?
Oh,
I'm seven seconds underneath.
Um,

499
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.810
thank you to everybody once again,

500
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:01.650
they came out to the goddamn comedy jam and thank you to Josh,

501
00:30:01.651 --> 00:30:03.730
Hannah Myers and all those guys for letting me,

502
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:08.150
they get to play at the Roxy Dude dressed as John Barn and plaintiff's 71 Ludwig

503
00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:12.970
at me fucking,
you know what I mean?
That's,
it's,
that's some shit.

504
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:16.390
Someday when I'm fucking old and I'm staring at the wall still drinking,

505
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:20.230
of course I'm going out like Peter O'toole,
right.
Still fucking drinking.

506
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.500
I'm just going to have the greatest smile on my face just thinking about shit

507
00:30:23.501 --> 00:30:27.340
like that.
Like I fucking did that.
That was so much fucking fun.

508
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.260
And uh,
it was just great.
I will do that show as long as they fucking do it.

509
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:37.120
And uh,
so that's it.
And um,
yeah,
that's it.

510
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:39.910
Now I'm off to Ireland next time I talked to you.

511
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.490
I don't know when I'm going to be,
I don't know where I'm going to leave me,
lady.

512
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:44.710
I think I'm going to be over in a,

513
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.480
I think I've already done the three dates in Ireland.
Maybe or maybe not.
I Dunno.

514
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.540
All I know is I think I drive from Bristol to Manchester,

515
00:30:56.051 --> 00:30:57.610
England.
And if I have time,

516
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.280
I have to pay my respects that John Bonham's grave and I have to do it in a row.

517
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:05.620
I got to do it.
No fucking selfie.
None of that bullshit.

518
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:11.030
Uh,
you know,
tried to do an a class he fucking way.
You know what I mean?
I always,

519
00:31:11.031 --> 00:31:13.720
I remember because I went to Elvis' house one time and I just felt bad.

520
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:16.300
I went there to actually laugh,
like,
oh,
get a bit out of this.

521
00:31:16.301 --> 00:31:19.330
And I went to his house,
Graceland,
and I just felt bad.

522
00:31:19.331 --> 00:31:23.860
I just felt like I was intruding on the guy's personal life and,
uh,

523
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.180
not what they had like a gift shop across the street with like Elvis cuckoo

524
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:28.541
clocks.

525
00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:32.770
Like that guy's one of the most exploited fucking entertainers of all fucking

526
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:33.221
time.
I mean,

527
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:36.370
the guy's been dead for almost 40 years to still making money off his fucking

528
00:31:36.371 --> 00:31:41.170
image.
Um,
then in the end,
you walk by his grave in the back.

529
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.150
It's just like a bunch of people just walking by and yammering and saying dumb

530
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:50.440
shit and that just the sound,
a fucking flip flops and poverty just walking by.

531
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.210
It was just bad.
It's like,
wait,
what are we doing here?

532
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:56.891
What are we doing it?

533
00:31:56.891 --> 00:32:00.340
They're like an Elvis said the three TVs cause the elites the lock to watch all

534
00:32:00.341 --> 00:32:03.310
the fucking games and the TVS are all fucking out of date,

535
00:32:03.311 --> 00:32:05.920
but she knows something.
When I went in there into his house,

536
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.740
I really saw how fucking like,
yeah,

537
00:32:08.741 --> 00:32:12.910
this must have been the only place that this guy could go to escape how famous

538
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:13.421
he was in.

539
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:17.650
He must have been really nice for him to be here and just be able to chill and

540
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:18.280
relax.

541
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.970
And it's just really fucking ironic that this place that was so peaceful for him

542
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.340
is that we're all traipsing through it.

543
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:29.860
I'll try to stretch our heads and look up to the fucking the upstairs so maybe

544
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:33.910
you can see the toilet that he fucking collapsed from,
you know,
it's really bad.

545
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:40.090
All right,
I guess I'm going to end on that.
Right.

546
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:45.190
And I commend anybody who really honestly sits there and watches these

547
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.830
Republican and Democratic National Convention.
So at this point,

548
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:52.460
if you can actually sit through there,
I didn't watch it,
but did,
uh,

549
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.240
did the fucking guy there?

550
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.253
<v 2>MMM.</v>

551
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.370
<v 0>Bernie Sanders.
Did he,
did he</v>

552
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:03.660
just completely flip flop and endorsed Hillary?
Is that what he did?
I mean,

553
00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:04.680
just how can I just,

554
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.830
nothing I just don't understand is how you can sit there watching somebody in a

555
00:33:08.831 --> 00:33:11.110
debate,
trashing somebody and trashing,

556
00:33:11.111 --> 00:33:13.780
have been trashed from trash them saying why they think they're going to be

557
00:33:13.781 --> 00:33:17.500
awful.
And then when the person they say is going to be awful beach them,

558
00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.170
they then just do a fucking 80.
It'd be like,

559
00:33:20.171 --> 00:33:24.610
I think this person that I said soft is going to make a great president and as

560
00:33:24.611 --> 00:33:25.930

Have you ever been in the wine aisle at your local store?

572
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:07.001
Just staring at the massive selection of wine with no idea which bottle of booze

573
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:08.444
to choose from?

574
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:12.860
Most of us go with the bottle that has the best looking label and hope that it's

575
00:34:12.861 --> 00:34:14.120
going to be good.

Ooh,

637
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.870
Ooh.

638
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.440
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?
This is below par.</v>

639
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:35.050
It's the Monday morning podcast and this is the third attempt at trying to be

640
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.530
remotely amusing musing on this thing because a,

641
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.150
I've been on vacation the last week and um,
to what?

642
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.610
Happy and I'm too relaxed.

643
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:47.500
Had a great time down there and talk at one of the,
uh,

644
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:52.960
one of the whitest places on the planet.
It's not that,
it was funny,

645
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:55.680
I just literally had to pause when I said one of the,
what is things,

646
00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.190
because someone of color was coming by and for some reason I thought that it was

647
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:03.460
going to be viewed as racist.
Like I was actually going like,
yeah,

648
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:06.700
it was really white.
It was awesome.
It was actually,

649
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.500
it was so white.
I believe my level of whiteness was actually offensive,

650
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.420
if you can believe it.
And uh,
yeah,
very.

651
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.690
I can't explain the welfare.
It's,
I don't know.

652
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:28.060
I was staying out in Wisconsin,
which is even more snooty than a Nantucket.

653
00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:32.620
But,
uh,
if you ever get out there is a little a tip I'll give you,

654
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:37.750
take a trip of the
fucking brewery out there,

655
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.150
the hell,
the name of it.
Uh,
Cisco,

656
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.330
Cisco brewers and make their own beer,

657
00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:47.320
wine and vodka out there and uh,
go on their website.

658
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:51.010
If you're a big vodka drinker,
cisco.com I believe,

659
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:55.450
but just look up Cisco Brewers,
CIS.
See,
oh,

660
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.930
I'm telling you this shit is smoother than grey goose.
It's,

661
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.830
it's unbelievable.
I guess the island's sits on an aquifer.

662
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:08.490
The amount of times people told me that in the last week at just some point,

663
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:15.010
it would come up.
Uh,
you know,
this island sits on an awkward for,
and like you,

664
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.810
I was like,
what the fuck is an aquifer was on vacation,
so the fuck wasn't there.

665
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:24.520
It was more like,
oh,
and what might an aqua Fairbury be?
Evidently,
uh,

666
00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:26.920
you know,
I don't know what it is.

667
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:28.570
I was going to go on the Internet and I was going to look it up,

668
00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:33.340
but as far as I could tell from the drunk people and their boat shoes,

669
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.320
and they're a tiger woods shorts,

670
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.550
they was saying that a Nantucket was formed from a glacier.

671
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:45.010
And Somehow,
uh,
I don't know what sits on fresh water in the water,

672
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:50.011
trickles under all kinds of bedrock and shift from Massachusetts and shift that

673
00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:52.420
just really killed the cleanness of the water.

674
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:57.220
They fucking comes from Massachusetts and shit.
It's like really fucking clear.

675
00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:02.560
But it,
yeah,
it goes right underneath the ocean.
And I guess it comes right up.

676
00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:05.440
And,
uh,
that's how they make their pod cut tastes so good.

677
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.600
I learned that the trick it all my life and I had no idea that the cleaner the

678
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:14.800
water,
the smoother and more pure your,
uh,
your heart stuff is.

679
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.550
So maybe that's why all those hillbillies and make a moonshine up in the

680
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:22.990
Appalachian trail,
you know?
Yeah.
They've talked to somebody,

681
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:24.510
not 10 people I know,
who've,

682
00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:29.511
who've walked the Appalachian trail somehow got Lyme disease and uh,

683
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:32.470
you know,
I'm all up for an adventure.

684
00:41:32.471 --> 00:41:37.130
But when you get like a disease that they did an episode about on little house

685
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:41.960
on the prairie,
you know what I mean?
Basically some 1800 shit,

686
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.200
you know what I mean?
You get,
Hey,
it's,
I'll look the other way.

687
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.690
I mean we've all la put the gun to our head,
you know what I'm saying?

688
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.610
That's how modern disease,

689
00:41:49.611 --> 00:41:54.080
but you get like typhoid fever for the plague.

690
00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.540
Okay.
What's fucked up man?
I was reading this book on the population and uh,

691
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.700
I think I talked about this.
I can't,

692
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:06.620
I can't remember last week I was doing podcasts from a bathroom in this cabin I

693
00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:07.190
was staying at,

694
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.600
cause it's the only place I could get some sort of cell phone service.

695
00:42:09.601 --> 00:42:13.100
But through reading this book about population

696
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.080
and basically I think medicine,
medicines,
what really fucked us over.

697
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.940
A lot of people think it's dumb people fucking and creating more people.

698
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.660
That's really caused the population problem.
But it isn't.

699
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:31.750
It's smart people giving dumb people penicillin that has caused the population

700
00:42:32.781 --> 00:42:36.620
explosion.
And A,
I can't stress to you enough,

701
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.090
having traveled as much as I had truly.

702
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.120
How many people need to die in an avalanche for us to ever save the polar bears?

703
00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:50.331
I know.

704
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:53.990
What the fuck I'm talking about going to God Damn Sunburn on my brain here.

705
00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.570
All right.
Now if you're new to my page,
man,
I've got a big thing coming up here.

706
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.900
Uh,
I was saying last week,
my special was coming out on August 23rd.

707
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.860
They just moved the date.

708
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:06.450
I have my own one hour stand up special coming out on comedy central on August

709
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.790
31st.
All right.
And,
uh,
it's called,
what do I do this?

710
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.000
And it's actually coming on after one a day and pokes specials,

711
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:16.280
which is great cause he has like 9 million fans.

712
00:43:16.281 --> 00:43:21.200
So if a third of them hang around,
it's going to be a great thing for me.

713
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.870
Um,
yeah,
August 31st and this week my CD comes out.

714
00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:30.440
We'll be in stores,
uh,
have the same name.

715
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:34.190
It's basically a CD of the specialists coming out on 31st and it's September,

716
00:43:34.191 --> 00:43:37.940
the DVD will be coming up.
So look for all that in stores.

717
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:41.240
I'll have more information this week and I'll be putting something up on my

718
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:44.120
website as far as,
uh,
they give you all that information.

719
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.660
But let's get down to the podcast questions because my flight's going to be

720
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:51.170
leaving here soon.
My flight to Charlotte and then on to La.

721
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.080
I don't know why I got the connecting flight.
Seemed like a good idea.

722
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:59.150
It's something stupid.
All right.
A bill with all,
uh,

723
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.900
the latest postings.
What the fuck did my laptop just doing?
What are you doing?

724
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.270
How did I hang on?

725
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.630
You know that when you try to click on something and then it selects it and then

726
00:44:08.631 --> 00:44:12.620
just starts going 90 miles an hour down the page.
All right,
bill,

727
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:18.340
with all this posting of late of a spontaneous crowd members heckles and

728
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:21.590
interruptions,
it's getting me wonder about,

729
00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.880
wondering about a couple of things or I butchered reading that question that

730
00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:29.810
basically saying in the last month I put a couple of postings on youtube and on

731
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:34.760
my myspace page of people yelling out random shit during my shows.
Uh,

732
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.010
her question is,
you seem,
or his question,
I don't know who sent this.

733
00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:41.280
You seem to be pretty nice generally to these people,

734
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:44.430
even if they're being a dick,
but I'm sure that's always,

735
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.870
that's not always the case.

736
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:50.400
Have you ever offended someone to the point of them trying to fight you or made

737
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:54.240
someone cry or something else really awkward?
Um,

738
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.190
actually,
you know what,
the two people heckling me,
the lady going,
thank you.

739
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.220
And the guy who's in the crowd who was blind,
neither,

740
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.990
neither one of them will be in malicious,

741
00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.200
which is why I wasn't being malicious back to them.
You know what I mean?

742
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.320
That's Kinda how I work.
If someone's being a dick to me,

743
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.920
I become a nuclear to them cause you have to out get them.

744
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:18.330
You know what I'm saying?
It's weird.
You've got to be,

745
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:21.330
you got to go 10 times meaner than they're ever going to go.

746
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.450
You know what I mean?
It's like that untouchable.
They bring a knife,

747
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:28.530
you bring a gun,
you know,
they make fun of you fucking head.

748
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.790
You talk about their mothers,
Regina cancer or something.
I know it's disgusting,

749
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:36.810
right.
But I,
you know,
I don't make the rules.
That's how it works.
All right?

750
00:45:36.811 --> 00:45:39.660
You want to change the standup world.
You go do the late show,

751
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:43.560
you go do the third show,
Saturday night and the middle of fucking nowhere.

752
00:45:43.561 --> 00:45:48.561
And you tell me that vaginal cancer does not seem like a viable means of self

753
00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:52.650
defense.
I'm not wishing that on anybody,

754
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.870
but I'm not above bringing it up

755
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.690
and wishing it on a crowd number.
I Dunno.
And it's hypothetical,
mother.
All right.

756
00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:02.170
That was brutal.
Um,
anyway,

757
00:46:02.171 --> 00:46:05.130
so you've ever offended someone to the point of them trying to fight you?
Uh,

758
00:46:05.131 --> 00:46:09.100
yeah.
I had one girl chase me around the state and one time and uh,

759
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:10.420
I didn't know what to do,
you know,

760
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.550
cause she was abroad and if I hit her I'm going to go to jail.

761
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.320
Which is a funny thing about that,
you know what I mean?

762
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.470
It's like they getting up there and they got a glass and they want to smash it

763
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:22.440
over your head.
You know,
I'm not trying to be a dick,

764
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:25.440
but at the end of the day that is,
you know,
the average woman is,

765
00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:29.640
weighs over a hundred pounds,
you know,
upwards of 150.
You know,

766
00:46:29.641 --> 00:46:33.870
the average brought out there,
you know,
they got some,
uh,
titties.

767
00:46:33.871 --> 00:46:38.670
They might be pushing one 60.
Who knows,
right?
You start swinging the glass.

768
00:46:38.671 --> 00:46:41.670
You know,
I never took a physics class,
but you can really fuck somebody up.

769
00:46:41.671 --> 00:46:46.470
But for some reason,
because they have a vagina cancer free,
of course.

770
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:50.790
Um,
all of a sudden now I have to stand there.
There's really,

771
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:55.380
there's really no way to get out of it without looking like a tool.

772
00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:01.170
Either stand there and you let some girls smash you over the head
and be,

773
00:47:01.171 --> 00:47:04.680
you run away and you look like the biggest fag ever.

774
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:09.330
Or see you blast them in the face and uh,
you know,

775
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:13.320
then you look like,
you know,
you look like a wife beater rather than no.

776
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.030
There was another adult who they,
rational brain who was,
you had a glass,

777
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.010
which is considered a,
is that attempted murder.

778
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:26.580
If you smash you,
I know if you smash a bottle over,

779
00:47:26.581 --> 00:47:28.650
somebody said that's assault with a deadly weapon.

780
00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:32.770
I do know as is if you bumped into somebody with your car,

781
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.070
I learned that.
How the one,
I'll tell you that story here in a minute.

782
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.740
Basically what happens is lady came up on stage so I didn't know what the fuck

783
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:39.574
to do.

784
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:44.440
So I just picked up the mic stand and I put it between her and myself sort of

785
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:47.830
alligator arm that didn't have it extended way out because that would seem to

786
00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:50.380
hostile.
So I kind of had it,
you know,

787
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:52.600
I didn't want to have it up against me because that would defeat the purpose.

788
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.640
So I kind of had halfway,
you know,

789
00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:57.040
so it was like I was extending an olive branch in a way,

790
00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.670
and I basically backed up in a circle and she was so drunk.

791
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:05.440
She kept following me until,
uh,
let me see.

792
00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:07.840
I think she got tired.
It was danger fields where it happened.

793
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.700
And of course there's no security there,

794
00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:14.701
so they probably just sitting there laughing and their ocean's 11 ways to cloak

795
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.550
from waist length,
red coats,
math.
Fucking,
why am I even trying to be funny here?

796
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.510
Too Fun to relax.
That'd be funny.
Next week.

797
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.700
I already forgot the story that I told you I was going to tell you.
Jesus Christ.

798
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.200
Let me go back here a second.
What the fuck is,

799
00:48:29.201 --> 00:48:31.660
I was talking about being on stage,

800
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:37.180
somebody chasing you all the car thing,

801
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:42.370
but that's all right.
What time?
I was in a car.
Right?
And that was driving.

802
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.230
Isn't that unbelievable?
Yeah.
I know.

803
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.530
I'm living in an amazing license driving down the street.
And,
uh,

804
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.530
I put on my left directional to get into the left lane.

805
00:48:50.531 --> 00:48:54.280
So there's this lady in the left lane,
but there's enough room for me to get in.

806
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:59.140
But she does the Kentucky thing.
She stomps on the gas.
Right.
So,

807
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:03.130
you know,
try not to let me in,
you know what I mean?
And then drives,
you know,

808
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.870
to basically cut me off.
She doesn't let me.

809
00:49:04.871 --> 00:49:08.860
And so when I get behind her I'd be better.
So she beats at me.
So I'm like,

810
00:49:08.861 --> 00:49:11.710
what the fuck I'm right.
You cut me off.
I'd be back at her.

811
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.600
And then she just snapped.

812
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:19.140
She just slammed on the horn and held it all the way up to this red light,

813
00:49:19.991 --> 00:49:23.920
which is like a football field away.
She just went like,
Eh,

814
00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.220
like a half a mile staring at me.

815
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.970
I could see her BDI staring at me in the rear view mirror,

816
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.710
came all the way up to the red light.

817
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.560
And the second she stopped,
I just be real quick.

818
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.920
I went just to piss her off just so I get it last,
you know,

819
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:47.350
the next thing you know,
I just see her reverse lights come on
and she fucking,

820
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.120
she backed into the front of my car really lightly and I'm like,

821
00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:53.440
what the fuck is this girl doing?

822
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:56.380
And then I see are reaching into the glove box and I was like,
oh my God,

823
00:49:56.381 --> 00:49:59.860
she's got a gun.
And there was somebody behind me so I couldn't get out.

824
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.620
And I'm not gonna lie to you.
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

825
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:05.690
So she jumps out of the car and you know,

826
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.330
I rolled down my window like a crack because I'm so scared.
Right.
You know this,

827
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.180
this psycho lady.
I'm like,
what's your problem?

828
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:17.300
She ended up having a pad and a piece of paper and she wrote down my license

829
00:50:17.501 --> 00:50:21.430
plate number.
Then she jumped in the car and she drove away.

830
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:25.450
Unfortunately somebody saw it and they said,
hey,
was it a friend of yours?

831
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:28.760
Cause that's how lightly she hit me.
I said,
no,
that was some psycho.

832
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.370
And the person gave me their business cards,
which I kept.

833
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.770
So because I'm a fucking Moron,
oh,
I just completely forgot about it.

834
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:40.370
And next thing you know,
I'm on the road and all of a sudden I get a phone call.

835
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.391
Yes.
Hello.

836
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:45.650
This is a officer's shepard calling from the Elsa Gundo police department

837
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:51.020
investigating a,
a hit and run possible assault with a deadly weapon.

838
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.490
Basically what she did when she backed her car into my car and then said I rear

839
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:59.840
ended her.
Um,
but I had the business card so I was able to get out of it.

840
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.540
And,
uh,
you know,
who knows,
who knows what would have happened,
you know,

841
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:06.230
I could have gone to jail and uh,

842
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.860
some would have tried to rape me and then I'd have to kill him.

843
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.390
And then I'd be like Tom Selleck in that really bad movie,
you know,

844
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:20.330
that's why I like Shawshank redemption.
That's the only one with a dude actually.

845
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.290
They show what would happen if an accountant goes to jail.
You know,

846
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.130
he doesn't start lifting weights and somehow take over the jail.

847
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:32.060
Now you know what happens?
He gets fucking raped and he gets raped for years.

848
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.440
And that's why you always want to have a fucking alibi,
okay?

849
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:40.640
Especially if you're having a bad marriage.
If you're going through a tough time,

850
00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:44.930
whenever you go out,
always make sure you got a friend with you,
okay?

851
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.600
Because if you don't,

852
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.950
someday when someone does you the favor of lacking that fucking chick that

853
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.210
you're sick of a,
they're going to blame it on you.
And then you know what?

854
00:51:56.211 --> 00:52:01.190
You're going to get raped repeatedly.
Um,
unless you're good at math,

855
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.960
you know,

856
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.320
and the wardens a piece of shit and your shiny shoes or whatever the fuck that

857
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.920
plays out.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Look,
all I know is this,

858
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.070
I got a special coming out August 31st called,
why do I do this?

859
00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:16.010
Please do me a favor.
Tell as many people as you know,

860
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.700
and even people you don't know,
just bugged people.
Just tell them to watch.

861
00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:22.880
It's August 31st buy cds coming out this week,

862
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:26.530
August 31st comedy central.
And then,
uh,

863
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.620
my DVD comes out in September.
I don't know why it's happening like this,

864
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:31.640
but that's the way it's happening.

865
00:52:31.641 --> 00:52:35.990
So please watch that and then come out and see me cause I've already written a

866
00:52:35.991 --> 00:52:40.210
whole new hour cause cause I'm a shit.
That's why I'm at the shit.

867
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:43.220
You know who's getting killed on fucking,
I'm on my way to be in the shit.

868
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.110
I'm trying to be the shit.
All right.
That's why we're not,

869
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:47.600
that's the real reason why I wrote another hour.

870
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.610
Actually that's not the real reason.

871
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:52.910
The real reason why I wrote it because I'm so fucking paranoid.
Once my material,

872
00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:57.180
it has been out there that you know that's a big nightmare.

873
00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.380
Being onstage telling a joke and having a whole crowd going,

874
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:05.830
you already did do and TV fuck and then I just started bombing and then somehow

875
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:11.840
it spreads across the Internet.
No one ever goes to my shows again.

876
00:53:11.841 --> 00:53:13.730
I got to move back in with my parents.

877
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.760
Then again I'm working in a warehouse again.
I'm loading trucks,

878
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:21.260
you know what I mean?
Catastrophizing,
I believe is the thought process.

879
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:27.030
Okay,
I'm going to wrap this thing up.
I'm going to be at a,
the comedy works.

880
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.980
These are the gigs in August and we'll get the comedy works in,
uh,
Denver,

881
00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:35.610
Colorado,
uh,
starting this Thursday.

882
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:39.810
I think that's July 31st through a Saturday night,
August 2nd.

883
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.050
And uh,
go to my website,

884
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.380
[inaudible] dot com to get all the information.

885
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.640
I'll be at the Miami improv somewhere around August 12th.

886
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.040
I don't have a fucking dates in front of me that they sitting right there in the

887
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:57.570
myspace page.
You can say it.
And then after that,
I believe I'm doing,

888
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:01.980
I'm doing the stress factory in New Jersey,
New Jersey.
Sorry,

889
00:54:01.981 --> 00:54:05.210
I got the hiccups now.
Um,
I'm trying to think of like,

890
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.580
I remember any more podcast questions.
Somebody asked me a great question.

891
00:54:09.450 --> 00:54:14.100
I didn't copy it,
but it was a copy and paste it where I can read it right now.

892
00:54:14.101 --> 00:54:15.510
What the fuck was it had something to do.

893
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:20.130
What is the most overrated thing ever saw in your life and what do you think is

894
00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:24.780
the most underrated?
And uh,
that's too big a topic.

895
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:29.190
Just come up with one answer.
I'm going to answer even more of it next week.

896
00:54:29.191 --> 00:54:34.191
But the shit off the top of my head that I could say was the most overrated shit

897
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:37.920
of all time.
Uh,
let's see,

898
00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:40.320
Josh Hartnett the strokes.

899
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:46.020
Tony Manda rich and he old sports fans out.
They remember that guy.

900
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:50.550
The incredible bulk scale was an offensive line and they put him on the cover of

901
00:54:50.551 --> 00:54:54.390
sports illustrated.
I Dunno what they thought he was going to fucking do,
but,
uh,

902
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.320
he didn't do it.
Uh,

903
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.600
what else was overrated?
Same.

904
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:07.260
Not,
not being famous.
Just that TV show fame.
Everybody seems to love that show.

905
00:55:07.261 --> 00:55:09.660
Bruce Springsteen.
I don't get it.

906
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:12.900
I don't fucking get it.
You know,

907
00:55:12.901 --> 00:55:17.470
the guy sells at giant stadium 19 times in a row.
So a,

908
00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:21.840
it's gotta be me,
but I'll tell you,
I don't,
I don't get it.

909
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:26.310
I don't,
I don't fucking get it.
So I guess that's not an underrated,

910
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.070
that would be what?
How about a good,
here's a good one for you guys.

911
00:55:29.071 --> 00:55:30.390
Why don't you guys answer me this one.

912
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:36.410
What's the most popular thing that everybody was into it then you didn't get,

913
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.490
okay,
I'm not,

914
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:43.080
I'm not trashing Bruce Springsteen like he's fucking in sync or a boy band.

915
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.990
You know what I mean?
I'm talking about like,

916
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:49.200
like you know those fucking plastic.

917
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.910
See through cogs that everybody seems to be wearing now.
Crocs,

918
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:59.280
you know I don't get it.
Can one person to wear shoes like that?

919
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:00.960
It's fucking Mario Batali.
Okay.

920
00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:03.210
And I'll let you can make pasta to the well method.

921
00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.210
He shouldn't be wearing those pocket.
Thanks.
Okay.

922
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:12.090
I didn't care if you're on hell's kitchen,
just the worst fucking show on TV.

923
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.430
I just can't believe the widows.

924
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.480
People sit there and they let that guy yell at them.

925
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:19.650
It's bad enough you got to go.
Yes chef.
You know what I'm saying?

926
00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:24.140
But you want a war or something?
Fucking guy.

927
00:56:24.141 --> 00:56:28.240
It makes tuna tar tar.
Get over yourself.
I ever had a child.

928
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:34.210
We just allowed themselves to be yelled at by a fucking chef to that level.

929
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:36.220
That kind of looks like an Inchcape.
Bobby Kelly.

930
00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:42.040
I know Bobby Kelly losing weight.
You guys should go and coverage.
And by the way,

931
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.370
look great.
Last time I saw him this,

932
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:48.610
I'm looking at the after picture of Bobby Kelly Walker by that he will get to,

933
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:51.400
cause I have faith in them.
Um,

934
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:56.200
what else the fuck was I talking about?
Oh yeah,

935
00:56:56.201 --> 00:56:59.590
the shift that everybody's into that,
that I just,
I just don't

936
00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:05.350
let them get,
you know,
I'll tell you something that's really fucking underrated.

937
00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:09.010
Water
water's really underrated.

938
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.970
Water's one of the most underrated things of all time.

939
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:17.680
There is no reason for coke,
soda,
these fucking sports drinks,

940
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.240
electrolytes and all that shit.
They,
they did just drink some water.

941
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.880
I'll tell you what else is underrated.

942
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:30.270
If you eat a banana and apple and an orange and then later on day you just have

943
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:35.910
a house salad,
you will be as regular as a fucking race horse.

944
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:41.410
How these stupid shows on commercials,
they giving people pills,

945
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.460
at least fucking old people.
You know,
it was bottled down working anymore.

946
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:50.140
It's like if they would just eat some fruit,
you know what I mean?

947
00:57:50.141 --> 00:57:52.090
He's been fruit and then have a fucking salad.

948
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.420
And I'm telling you moon river,

949
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.450
any flesh fans out there?
Um,

950
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.640
what else?
What else is fucking a,
I'll tell you.
You know what?
I'll you,

951
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:10.000
the one thing that ever lived,
lived up to the hype was the Ipod.

952
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.710
The iPod is one of the few things,
you know what I'm saying?

953
00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.860
They never lived up to the heights.
And speaking of hype,

954
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.780
I'm going to see Batman this week.
And uh,
as far as I know,

955
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.180
he's ledger lives up to the high plan,
uh,
playing the joker.

956
00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:30.311
I think it was fucked up.

957
00:58:30.311 --> 00:58:35.311
Somebody had the amount of people who came up to me with theories as to why he,

958
00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:35.580
oh,

959
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:39.130
because people thought he'd killed himself rather than he sort of took the wrong

960
00:58:39.131 --> 00:58:43.510
stuff the wrong time.
You know what I mean?
Rung them out.
You know,
he told me,

961
00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:48.040
he goes,
you know,
like,
you know what?
I know why.
I know why.
I don't know why.

962
00:58:48.041 --> 00:58:51.640
I know why he killed himself.
He was,
he was losing his hair.

963
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.550
Can you fucking believe that it was one of the dumbest?
They're like,

964
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.450
like he couldn't affair of like,
he couldn't,

965
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.850
he couldn't afford a fucking hair plugs.

966
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:08.320
I'll get one of those John Travolta wigs.
You know what I'm saying?

967
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:12.070
What would you shave your fucking head?
Take a nod from me.
You know what I mean?

968
00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:18.340
How would you kill yourself?
You know,
I just,
I don't,
I don't buy that.

969
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.700
The guy didn't kill himself.
He just,
unfortunately,
I don't know what happened.

970
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:26.840
I'm like,
I'm going to try to act like I'm trapper John m d here,
you know,

971
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:31.220
which I'm not obviously haven't even played a doctor on TV,
have I?

972
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:34.690
No,
I haven't.
I like it.

973
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.180
I like how it only took me eight seconds to run meant and we threw my whole

974
00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:43.040
fucking acting career.
Um,
so anyways,
what time is it here?

975
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:47.510
Oh,
Shit.
All right,
my plane's going to be born here in a few minutes.
Um,

976
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:52.010
once again,
uh,
thanks to everybody who came out to my shows in Pittsburgh,
please,

977
00:59:52.011 --> 00:59:55.040

978
00:59:55.041 --> 00:59:58.880
why do I do this on comedy central?
Uh,

979
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.840

I believe on August 4th and fifth.

980
01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.330
Uh,

981
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:11.020
you guys really seem to be liking these random videos that I've been making a

982
01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.670
different kind of tape and every step that I do and if,
uh,

983
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.830
if I'm basically is what I'm going to do is if I buy just go off on a risk

984
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:23.270
that's kind of specific to that city or if I have a good back and forth with

985
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:23.691
somebody.

986
01:00:23.691 --> 01:00:28.340
It's a great way to give you guys some new laughs without me having to burn any

987
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:32.960
material.
You know what I'm saying?
Yo.
You know what I'm saying?
Um,

988
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.120
all right.
That's it.
You guys all have a good week.

989
01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:39.740
Thanks to listen to my podcast and I'm working on a new website and I will be

990
01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:44.390
putting all of my blogs up there.
Okay.
That's why I haven't blogged in a while.

991
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:48.650
I have been blogging,
but I have not posted any of them because,

992
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.250
uh,
evidently the Facebooks,

993
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:57.110
the myspace and the fraudsters,
they own anything you post up there,

994
01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:01.610
they own.
Like,
I can still make a book of my blogs,
which is what I'd like to do.

995
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.020
But so can they,
and uh,
you know,
I don't like working for free.

996
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:10.870
I don't know about you guys,
but I don't like doing that.
So you know,

997
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.930
I'm just going to start the whale blog on my space from here on out is I will

998
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:17.450
just put something,
you know,
hey,

999
01:01:17.451 --> 01:01:20.000
I wrote a blog and then I'll just put a link to my website.

1000
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.870
That's how I'm going to do with,
because uh,
yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

1001
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.590
I'm blogging,
blogging from me,
blogging and make you guys laugh.

1002
01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:31.880
I'm not blogging to give fucking Rupert Murdoch some more free content.

1003
01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:37.240
All right.
And that is it.
You guys all have a good week and a,

1004
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:41.150
I will talk to you later.
Please go out and buy my CD and stores this week.

1005
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:45.500
I believe it's August 4th.
I really wish I had the date.
I don't fucking know.

1006
01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:49.220
August 4th to August 5th.
Just look forward.
Why do I do this in stores?

1007
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:54.140
Tell me what you think then that keep those podcast questions coming and let me

1008
01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:54.800
know.
Uh,

1009
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.710
let me know some of the shit that you think is overrated or you think is an

1010
01:01:57.711 --> 01:02:00.430
underrated.
And the one thing that I dunno,

1011
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.870
people are just totally fucking into when you're not,

1012
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.700
which might be the same thing as saying something's overrated.
I Dunno.
They go,

1013
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:08.190
why don't you

1014
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:10.480
<v 5>send me the definition of overrated too?
All right.</v>

1015
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.880
So I see them through a crystal.

1016
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.330
Hey,
he's a sweet sound,

1017
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:27.690
bouncing around the never ending coal,

1018
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.300
the crystal

1019
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.620
bouncing around the room

1020
01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.373
or

1021
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.650
bounce around

1022
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:59.570
[inaudible].
