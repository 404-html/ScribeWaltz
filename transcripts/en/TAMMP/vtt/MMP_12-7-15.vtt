00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.041
Hey,

2
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:05.520
what's going on is bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:09.810
Monday,
December 7th,
2015.
Okay.

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.030
<v 1>Oh,
the</v>

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.490
<v 0>weather outside is frightful,</v>

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.120
but she'll who hustled delightful.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.580
So if you know fucking minds back your legs bad.
Sorry.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.620
Hey,
it's December everybody,
but December to remember.

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
Um,
happy holidays.
Oh,
it's the holiday season.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.880
So Merry Christmas.

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
I don't give a fuck if you find that offensive because then you're kind of

12
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.650
shitting on my religion.
Um,

13
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.850
is merry Christmas still offensive to people?

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.720
I can't wait for somebody to wish me happy Hanukkah and I'm going to blow a

15
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:49.554
gasket.
How

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.880
dare you say something Nice from your religion?

17
00:00:56.881 --> 00:01:00.420
How fucking dare you?
Um,

18
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.610
I kind of fucked up this shit with my Christmas shopping where you know who's

19
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:05.700
getting hurt when you're married.

20
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.060
It's all about getting your fucking wife something that's going to keep her

21
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:13.770
fucking Yap shut for maybe two,
three days.
Who's kidding?
Who?

22
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.760
You know what I mean?
Are they ever really happy with you?

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.740
I'm asking
you know,
something.

24
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:27.420
Let's try to spin this in a positive way if you have a wife.
Okay.

25
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.430
If you're a gay dude and,
and you know,
you feel like you're more the dude,
right?

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.210
And you're,
you're Fuckin your,
your,

27
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.060
your husband is always pitching a fit of just everything.
You know what I mean?

28
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.180
And you're just sitting there going,
what the fuck is with this too?

29
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.280
Why can't he just fucking,
can you just,

30
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.490
can you get a run together of four days of just being generally happy with me?

31
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.611
Okay.

32
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.611
If anybody's in that situation and you have figured out a way to somehow get

33
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:58.470
that to get that person to the fifth day,

34
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:02.820
could you please email me and tell me what your strategy is?
I don't give a shit.

35
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.940
Male females.
I think there's some bitchy guys and out there,
you know,

36
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:09.540
I'm sure women deal with that.
Some Moody Motherfucker,
I should talk,

37
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:11.850
I'm pretty fucking moody,
but generally speaking,

38
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:14.280
I like to think I'm in a good mood,
but I'm just saying,
you know what I mean?

39
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.810
So anyway,
so I go out,
um,
you know,

40
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.530
and I got my wife the gift and on,
you know,
the gift,
you know,

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.460
everything else is just to fill up the space underneath the tree.
You know,

42
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:30.600
he'd get her some fucking sweatpants,
you know?
No,
no,
no.
I just,
you know,

43
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:32.790
I forget you could wear,
I'm hanging around the house.
I'm not,

44
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:37.490
I'm not saying you got to go to the gym,
you know,
you get,
uh,
uh,
you know,

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.120
some mittens,
you know,

46
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.320
some beef Jerky is sticking in the stock and you're just trying to flush it out.

47
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.420
At that point,
you've already dropped a ton of cash.
Right.

48
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.210
And God knows what the fuck is she going to,
what's she going to get for you?

49
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.740
One of those pumps to fucking pump up that sports illustrated football.

50
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:57.740
You got like fucking 15 years ago when your team won a championship.
Well,
what,

51
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:00.890
what the fuck?
I can't even like,
I'm trying to think.

52
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.180
The last time I heard a guy friend of mine get excited about whatever the fuck

53
00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:09.500
he got for Christmas,
you know what I mean?
What,
what would the broad still,
okay.

54
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.590
They expected something big from their husband and then they go out and they

55
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:17.240
blow the cash on all the kids don't give a fuck about you.
You know what I mean?

56
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.420
You liked that fucking third shift night security guard or the house that,

57
00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:25.490
that's basically what it is,
you know?
I mean,
if she could,

58
00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:28.490
if she could build a little fucking outhouse,
you know,

59
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.310
right next to the front door and you could just sit in there all night with a

60
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:34.310
clipboard,
checking people in and out and say walk in and out of the house,

61
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.100
you know,
wearing a little uniform.

62
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.520
<v 0>Uh,
good afternoon Mrs me,
how are you?</v>

64
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.980
I'm really being overdramatic right now.
My,
my situation isn't that bad,

65
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:51.680
but you know what,
if you exaggerate for comedic effect.

66
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.310
So anyways,
so I got the,
I got the big gift out of the way.
I get the big one,

67
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.230
you know,
the one that,
you know,
won't make her sulk until Valentine's Day,

68
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.880
generally speaking.
All right,
I don't give a fuck how cool your wife is.
Okay.

69
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.680
Is this the slide into sulking?
You know,
just the way,
like those mid eighties,

70
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.010
Jaguar's always had fucking electrical problems.
It's the same fucking thing.

71
00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:20.950
They can't help it.
It's,
it's a design flaw.
Um,

72
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.430
Jeez,
I'm going hard this week.
Um,
what am I trying to say here?

73
00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:29.770
So I went and I got the big thing and I kinda just,
I dunno,

74
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.370
I just felt like,
because I got the big one out of the way so early,

75
00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:38.870
I had all of this fucking time.
Now all of a sudden it's December 7th.

76
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.380
There was only fucking whatever,
salad table.
Our Shopify days,
love Lords,

77
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.550
you know?
Um,
unless you going to shop Christmas morning and I guess you got 18,

78
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:50.480
but at that point,
what are you doing?

79
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:52.280
Picking Lemons off you'd fucking neighbors tree.

80
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.733
<v 2>MMM.</v>

81
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.480
<v 0>So I got to get some shit done,
but I have to hype my,
uh,</v>

82
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.930
my cartoon that's coming out.
F is for family.
This is the big push.

83
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.000
In fact this morning it starts,

84
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.480
I'm going to go do some radio here and um,

85
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.330
I'm going to New York City next week and then I come back out here to la and I

86
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:17.410
do a whirlwind tour of um,
you know,

87
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.731
doing some press.

88
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:22.930
So I'll definitely be going into ob and Jimmy before everybody asked,

89
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.470
they always add,
you go,
you go,
go,
go,
go,
go.
Why wouldn't I,

90
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.010
when have I not,
um,
bill,

91
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.470
maybe they were asking because they want to hear you on the show.
All right.

92
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.090
You know,
fair enough.
Fair enough.

93
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.330
So,
um,
today I'm doing the podcast,
then I'm doing,
um,

94
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.740
doing,
uh,

95
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.630
the press and then I have to do a little bit of Christmas shop and I got to

96
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:53.300
fucking knock it out over the next three days.
I got to get the dino,

97
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.810
I got to flush out the cast here.
Right.
It's like I got a Shitty fucking script,

98
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.153
you know,

99
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.180
and I already signed on the movie star that isn't selling tickets in the movie

100
00:06:03.181 --> 00:06:03.931
theater anymore.

101
00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:07.920
So I got my fucking lightening rod of fame and now I just got to flesh it out

102
00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:10.390
with shift that's going to prop it up.
That's going to compliment it.

103
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.900
You know what I mean?
So that's what,
uh,
that's what my goal is and I'm

104
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.873
<v 3>okay.</v>

105
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.540
<v 0>You know,
I'll tell you another year without kids.
It's starting to fuck with me.</v>

106
00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:24.930
But I gotta be honest with you after watching that whole fucking don't even

107
00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:28.560
watch it.
I got in the car,
my wife Listens to and fucking pee.

108
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.380
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.691
<v 0>Morning,</v>

110
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:36.691
but comes a collectic that was the electric eel band doing their version of ACDC

111
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.700
back in black on a viola.
You'd like to download that,

112
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.970
that's available@gofuckyourself.com.
Um,

113
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.090
so I,
you know,

114
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.230
she had on NPR and a gun in the car and I was driving down the street and that

115
00:06:52.231 --> 00:06:55.470
was,
I guess it was some big global warming summit.
And at this point,

116
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.910
not even the corporate cons can't deny that we're having an effect.

117
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.980
And now that they finally came around and said,

118
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.290
<v 3>okay,</v>

119
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.590
<v 0>yeah,
we are affecting it.
They then quickly said,</v>

120
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.450
but at this point it's too late.

121
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:15.890
So basically we might as well continue on what we're doing.

122
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.240
And it's just like what?

123
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.500
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

124
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.600
<v 0>I mean that's the same thing.</v>

125
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:24.380
Like I remember when Pete rose finally admitted that he was gambling on baseball

126
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.850
after 20 fucking years.
No,
I know.
I never gambled on baseball.

127
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.880
I never gambled on baseball.
I never gambled on baseball.
Five years later,

128
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:33.760
I'd never gambled on baseball.
10 you'd never go back?

129
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.310
I never got another big one then I know where he just goes.
Yeah,

130
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:41.450
I gambled on baseball.
Okay.
There now.
Now let me in the hall.
It's like,

131
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:43.550
wait a minute.
Wait,
wait,
wait a second.

132
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>

133
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.610
<v 0>No,
he was already rounded.
Second ticket,
he was go into the hall,
Helmet,
flew off,</v>

134
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:53.120
right.
Going to slide in head first to third,
um,

135
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.500
same fucking thing.
So that just made it so it's just going to get worse.

136
00:07:56.501 --> 00:08:01.501
And they just sort of nonchalantly talked about the helacious world in the

137
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:06.190
future that our children and our children's children are going to have to live

138
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:08.220
in.
And I was just kind of made me feel like,
you know,

139
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.160
maybe it should end with me.
So that's uplifting.

140
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.850
Oh,
jingle bells,
jingle bells,

141
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.930
jingle all the way.
Um,
we don't like that song.

142
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:24.931
We feel that there's sexual undertones jingle all the way as in going all the

143
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:29.470
way.
Uh,
you know,
the snow is white,
you know,

144
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.830
tactically speaking.
So is your ges,
if you were to draw it,
it's more of a,

145
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:40.630
uh,
who's your cream pie sort of color?

146
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.380
Oh my God.
What am I doing?
I'm talking about not having children.

147
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.190
I'm comparing snow to jazz.
This is just,
what is this?
You know what this is?

148
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:52.090
It's fucking entertaining to listen to somebody slowly going off the rails

149
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:57.000
during the holidays.
I got to tell you,
it's gotta be a fun thing.
Oh,
I did a,

150
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:00.390
a,
I did a podcast.
The,
uh,
I'd hit that podcast,

151
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.480
which is that true actually a drummer podcast.
And,
uh,

152
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.510
if you saw some of the guests that they've had on their,
um,

153
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.610
professional fucking drummers,
you know,
of the highest order,
you'd be like,

154
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:15.330
well what the fuck did they have this clown coming on there for?
I'd say,

155
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:18.060
you know,
every once said,
one of the great things about being a comedian,

156
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.511
you know what I mean?

157
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:21.090
Every once in a while they just bring you on some shit that you have no business

158
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:25.560
being on sticky on a food channel is some shit like that,
but it's uh,

159
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:28.800
it's called Id.
I'd hit that a podcast.

160
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.830
I want to thank Dave for having me on there and we talked about,
um,

161
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.350
talks about everything.
Man,
I'm a little bit about drums,
but uh,

162
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.620
I just got done doing a flight,
flying a helicopter and obviously,
uh,

163
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.140
and I've been soloing everybody.
I fund.

164
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:49.140
The thing about once you get your license,
you know what I mean?

165
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.790
And then you can legally solo,
there is that pit in your stomach of like,
dude,

166
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:57.030
you're really gonna let me go up there by myself.
You know,

167
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.290
this is whole weird thing when you learn it and get your pilot's licenses,

168
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.650
like you get to a certain point when you start getting a little cocky and you

169
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.100
stick in.
Like,
when is this guy going to solo me?
Dude,
I'm fucking ready.

170
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.910
When the fuck is this going to happen?
I could do this.
Look at him.
He's his feet.

171
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.940
Everything is off the controls.
I'm flying this fucking thing.

172
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:17.460
I'm bringing it in right on the numbers.
I'm doing this shit.

173
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.480
When the fuck is this guy going to solo me?
And then one day they go,
all right,

174
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:23.750
you're ready.
And then you're like,
you're really,
really,

175
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.430
Paul's shrink right up when he a fucking gut.
So,
um,

176
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.170
you know,
I got my license in the end of end of May and um,

177
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.050
I had not done a solo flight since,
um,

178
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.630
I was still a student just being,
you know,

179
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:47.340
combination of busy with a travel on the road and editing the F is for family.

180
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.670
And then also I didn't want to solo until I took the advanced auto rotation

181
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.620
class,
which is what I did in August and September.

182
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.400
Then I had my big run coming up to the New York City gigs.

183
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:59.490
So now I finally had the time.
And uh,
I did three flights last week.

184
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.900
I did one with an instructor and then the flight I did with the instructor,

185
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:08.100
I did it twice,
um,
Solo.
And uh,

186
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.510
I can't say it was fucking awesome.
I flew up the seven 10.

187
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:16.050
And actually this time I added dodger stadium and data.

188
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.090
I fly in the right hand side,
right?

189
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:23.091
So I just did a right orbit over dodger stadium and then flew over to the rose

190
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:29.120
bowl,
did a right orbit.
So I'm working on the field,
um,

191
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.900
Cross del Monte at midfield and then went back to long beach.
And,
um,

192
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.570
I did fuck up one time with the radio calls cause that's the big thing.

193
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:42.080
It's the radio calls.
I,
uh,

194
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.940
thought I was talking to Long Beach Tower,

195
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:47.310
but I was actually still talking to the La Basin,

196
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:51.210
which is just basically this big giant area where everybody's flying around.

197
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.550
I swear to God,
Dude,
you get at listening,

198
00:11:53.551 --> 00:11:55.800
but he came here with some people are saying like,

199
00:11:55.801 --> 00:11:59.220
those fucking people have been flying forever.
You get a hand,

200
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.750
no hands have 1.5 you're like,
what the fuck did you just say?

201
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.520
These fucking people who fly around mumbling into the Goddamn fucking radio.

202
00:12:08.521 --> 00:12:13.230
It's just like,
I don't,
for the life of I speak,
I had Nancy l,

203
00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.450
you know,
I fucking enunciate every,
you know,

204
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.930
I did base and traffic.

205
00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:23.931
This is helicopter one Sierra hotel flying northbound.

206
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.110
I fucking enunciate everything.
I go slow.
He's fun guys.
How has [inaudible]

207
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.590
I,
you know what I listen to at that point,
I just listened for the number.

208
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.010
I am go 1.5.
I'm like,
all right,
I'm going a thousand feet.

209
00:12:38.011 --> 00:12:40.860
He's at 1500 even if that's fucking assholes flying right at me,

210
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:45.660
he's going to be 500 feet above me.
But if I just have 1000,
all right,

211
00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:48.120
you're at the same level as me.
I have no fucking idea where you're at.

212
00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:50.160
So then I either go up or down 300 feet.

213
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.490
So anyways,
doing something like that,

214
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.790
really just as far as flying,
um,

215
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.930
just sent my confidence through the roof and like,

216
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:07.050
it's just like starting the thing up and shutting it down to the whole fucking

217
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:09.870
thing.
Just doing the whole thing.
Um,

218
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.060
<v 3>yeah.</v>

219
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.740
<v 0>And uh,</v>

220
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.000
you would think that that would make my confidence just in general go through

221
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:19.720
the roof,
you know,
flying a helicopter solo.

222
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:20.623
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

223
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.710
<v 0>You know,
over the city of La with all that fucking traffic that's up there.</v>

224
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.750
I was able to do that twice last week for about the collectively two hours by

225
00:13:29.751 --> 00:13:30.584
myself,

226
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.930
yet I'm going to make lasagna today and I'm nervous to make the noodles from

227
00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:37.910
scratch.
Does that make any fucking sense?

228
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

229
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.920
<v 0>Well,
you know,
I'm not gonna I can't possibly die doing that.
It just,</v>

230
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.730
it just doesn't make any fucking sense.
Right.

231
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.450
I don't want to talk about,
all I know is f is for family is coming.
Uh,

232
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.150
December 18th the same day.

233
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.080
It's like the 15th installment of Star Wars.
Okay,

234
00:13:58.081 --> 00:14:00.350
so you got a choice to make.
Alright.

235
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.800
And I'm obviously going to lobby for the F is for family side.

236
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.840
Okay,
now picture this.
All right?

237
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.870
You can either stand in fucking like a four mile line next to some jerk off

238
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:21.961
dress like Boba Fett of fucking Shabaka and people acting out light saber fights

239
00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:23.920
and all of that fucking thing.

240
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:27.730
Chevron is homeless people come up to you or hit you up for money and then

241
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:29.080
fucking,
you know,

242
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.310
e entertainment down there high or Billy Bush data down are the a bunch of jerk

243
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:33.611
offs.

244
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:37.600
You don't realize in three days they could walk in like a fucking gentleman and

245
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:41.290
just sit down and watch this movie.
It's not going anywhere.

246
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.370
<v 3>Okay?</v>

247
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.810
<v 0>You could get involved in that shit show or you could just sit in the comfort of</v>

248
00:14:47.811 --> 00:14:51.230
your own home.
Yeah.
Maybe pour yourself a glass of heck.

249
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:53.030
Nog was some fucking bourbon in it.

250
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.120
You know it just sit down and binge watch all six episodes of this cartoon.

251
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:01.880
Get the fire going.
You know what I mean?
Turn on the heat.

252
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.200
Whatever the fuck you want to do.

253
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:09.070
Eat a pot cookie and the privacy a and sit there in your underwear.

254
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.970
Do whatever the fuck you want to do.

255
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:15.350
Or You could go down to the goddamn movie theater and stand in a fucking know.

256
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:18.680
Maybe we have to go down there the night before.
You know,

257
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.870
whenever the fuck they gonna do.
I mean to,

258
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.820
I don't understand why there's still making those things other than money.

259
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.530
Darth Vader is dead.
Right?

260
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.240
He took off the how many deep dive of the good side one.
It's fucking over you.

261
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:36.050
You keep going.
But what happened before the before?

262
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.570
What about after the,
after
you know,

263
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.460
listen,
the original hand solos like seven years old.

264
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.790
Okay.
The original Luke Skywalker,
he's well into his sixties you know,
it's,

265
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.450
it's over.
Okay.
Star wars people.

266
00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.040
When he just gonna to admit that it's fucking over.
It's like my generation.

267
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:05.210
Can you really sit down and watch sesame street once Jim Hansen was gone and

268
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:07.820
here in that weird voice coming out of Kermit the frog.
It,
it's,

269
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:12.230
it's a fucking rep to fucking rap.
You know what I mean?
You know what?

270
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:15.500
I like sesame street.
I like when there's skating around on the fucking ice.

271
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:19.490
Just how weird that looks.
I'll fucking tall.
They all are.

272
00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:22.880
Who knew Burt was like six,
eight.
I had no fucking idea,
right?

273
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.140
Just out there skating around.

274
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.900
But what I love is he's not fucking saying anything as

275
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.260
far as I know.
I've never been to it.

276
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:33.710
I've just seen the commercials and they just sort of skate around.

277
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.650
I don't understand how they don't think that's going to scare the shit out of

278
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:42.350
children.
And I have a great idea.

279
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:47.351
Let's have fucking eight foot puppets skating around with the exact same look on

280
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:51.980
their face and their eyes don't blink for fucking an hour and a half playing

281
00:16:51.981 --> 00:16:55.550
weird circus music.
You want to take your kid to that?

368
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.730
Plus we all know that paying for shipping sucks.

369
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.190

What are you gonna do?

but cooking at home means eating healthier and saving money instead of ordering

390

those expensive takeout meals.
All right.
Hey,

it's so overwhelming.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.320
Should I use this burner or should I use that burner over there?
Don't worry.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.500
I'm psyched that they lost another one.
And you know why?
You know,

427
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:32.390
why am because right now I know all of sports talk radio is completely ignoring

428
00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:36.080
the fact that for the past two weeks,
Tom Brady has been driving a rental car.

429
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.110
All right.
The fucking Maseratis in the shop,

430
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.650
the Lambo is getting some rims put on it,
right?

431
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.800
Everybody thinks they're out there beating the patriots.

432
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.430
Who the fuck is he throwing too?
If one more fucking page,

433
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:53.630
you receive a twisted their ankle.
I was going to be out there,
you know,

434
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.830
Tom Looking at me with his steely eyes in the huddle.
I had that look of doubt.

435
00:25:57.831 --> 00:26:02.270
Like please don't throw it to me.
Um,

436
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.070
I just,
I,
you know,
I got,
I have too much shit to do.

437
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:09.380
I want to listen to sports talk radio today cause she yeah,

438
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:11.870
all this shit that they're going to be talking about.
First of all,
you know what?

439
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:16.400
That dead gut wrenching bears loss.
Oh my God,

440
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:21.050
it's another balding white male.
I really felt for that kicker.
Um,
you know,

441
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:23.780
but I also liked the fact that he had the balls to just walk around without a

442
00:26:23.781 --> 00:26:24.800
helmet on being like,
yeah,

443
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:27.800
this is what I look like at God knows as a fucking kicker.

444
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:31.130
I make enough money to get a hair transplant,
but you know what,

445
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.600
I'm playing the hand.
I was dealt to me that said,

446
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:38.900
confidence to me said that thing.
It was going right to the fucking uprights.

447
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:43.870
And what did he do?
He fucking hooks that tank
and it goes into overtime.

448
00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:48.430
So you know,
every fucking guy on sports talk radio today is stating the obvious.

449
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.760
<v 3>Well tell you right now,
you could not give tips or second</v>

450
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.160
week.
I mean

451
00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.730
<v 5>you start doing that shit.
I mean you,
you got to hit that.
You got to hit that.</v>

452
00:27:03.731 --> 00:27:08.110
I mean I'll be,
I'll be,
oh,

453
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.120
come on up.
Let me keep them all the culture.

454
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.050
The parents I could not confidently say did.

455
00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:15.450
If I get in with field goal range it,

456
00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.550
I'm not going to go for it on fourth down after,
after that.
Just way.

457
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:23.140
<v 3>Okay.
I'll tell you right now who vote your head coach,
you peers.
Hey,</v>

458
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.630
we'd be really concerned about the kicking game because if you kicking game,

459
00:27:26.631 --> 00:27:31.380
he's not firing on all cylinders.
If you're not on the same page,
okay?

460
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.010
He can't dig down deep and strap it on.

461
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.870
<v 0>You're not going to win aging.
Aging the football league.
Um,</v>

462
00:27:40.871 --> 00:27:44.510
so you know what the Patriots right now,
they're already results.

463
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.610
I had to worry a little Evelyn.

464
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

465
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.860
<v 0>They've lost two in a row.
It's fucking great.</v>

466
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.730
I hope they talk all kinds of shit about the team.
I am psyched.

467
00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.750
I'm psyched that we have two losses right now.
It's fucking perfect.

468
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.870
And as was slowly getting more healthy,
Edelman's going to come back.

469
00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.980
Bronx going to come back am and Dola we'll go back to being the third fucking

470
00:28:05.981 --> 00:28:10.780
choice,
right.
You know what I mean?
We'll get our running backs back.

471
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.340
Hopefully we'll get a couple of offensive fucking Lyman back.

472
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

473
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.060
<v 0>And uh,
we'll go into the playoffs.</v>

474
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.120
Healthy maybe even as an underdog or at least not with the [inaudible] do an

475
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:27.270
undefeated record is a fucking albatross around your goddamn neck.

476
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:30.300
Everybody gets all amped up.
Everybody wants to fucking knock you off.

477
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.540
Look at that fucking game with the saints yesterday that the panthers played.

478
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.570
There's no fucking way that game is that fucking exciting.

479
00:28:36.571 --> 00:28:40.140
If the parents are the painters come in with one fucking loss,
I'm telling you,

480
00:28:40.141 --> 00:28:43.920
it gets people extra amped up.
I taped that game.
I saw the highlights.

481
00:28:43.921 --> 00:28:47.840
I'm going to watch it today.
Um,
I like,

482
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.180
I can't even tell you how much I'm rooting for the panthers to go undefeated

483
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.720
unless they played the patriots in the Superbowl.
But I don't,

484
00:28:53.721 --> 00:28:57.380
I don't think we match up well against him.
But,
um,
we do.

485
00:28:57.381 --> 00:28:59.620
Obviously you have the experience,
but um,

486
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.940
I want to see a team go on to feed it,
you know?
Well,

487
00:29:04.941 --> 00:29:07.080
I mean there's a couple that I don't,
but uh,

488
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.020
anybody else other than like two fucking teams.
I don't want to see that.
Well,

489
00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:11.854
is it too,

490
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.520
I would give a shit if the giants did.

491
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.390
<v 3>Okay.</v>

492
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.510
<v 0>Well,
I give a shit if the Jetson,
I wouldn't give him a five maybe.</v>

493
00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.710
I don't think I would see Anna would bug me.
Seattle.

494
00:29:26.711 --> 00:29:31.090
It just bugs me one more fucking talking chimp on TV.

495
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.830
<v 3>Does she go to team to know what you wanted towards the play offs?</v>

496
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.060
<v 0>One Guy said that and then 50 people have said that.</v>

497
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:44.780
I'm literally sitting on a day right now,
Chelsea Hog.
She's a one team.
It's like,

498
00:29:44.781 --> 00:29:49.070
I got it.
I got it.
We get it.

499
00:29:49.071 --> 00:29:53.840
They were in the fucking super bowl the last two fucking years.
We get it.
Yeah.

500
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.200
Yeah.
They know what they're doing.
Who doesn't know that?

501
00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:01.790
Who wouldn't rather play a team with this shitty or fucking coach with less

502
00:30:01.791 --> 00:30:05.180
exposure.
Really?
Is that a team that could possibly be dangerous?

503
00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.640
Thank you for that analysis.

504
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.331
<v 5>Tell you right now,</v>

505
00:30:09.331 --> 00:30:13.500
I mean they were like one play away from winning two times in a row.

506
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:14.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

507
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.420
<v 5>And I'll tell you right now to do not be fooled by the Seattle Seahawks record.</v>

508
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:23.740
Okay?
They did get,
they got it through a slow stack.
They've had some injuries,

509
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.020
they had a lot of,
they lost a lot of talent,

510
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.390
but I'm telling the team is starting to come together.

511
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.870
They are starting to Gel and I'm telling you there's an excitement building in

512
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:34.420
Seattle then I'll tell you right now,
I wouldn't want,
right.
Joe

513
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.920
<v 0>is a big thing about Seattle.
If they play on the fucking road,
I mean it's,
it's</v>

514
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.830
<v 5>plea.
I tell you,
I healthy Marshawn lynch comes back and healthy and rested.</v>

515
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.060
<v 0>We got it.
We get it.
Who doesn't know that there were a good team?</v>

516
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.970
My thing is,
if they're on the fucking road,

517
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:53.610
there's no way they make it to the Superbowl.

518
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.050
If they have to go on the fucking road,
they're not going to make it.

519
00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.071
You know what I mean?

520
00:30:57.071 --> 00:31:02.071
The only way Seattle is truly like Seattle is if they're playing in their own

521
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:06.760
fucking stadium and they have all that extra help from that stadium that makes

522
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:11.680
their fan sound louder than they really are.
And I know I'm being a cunt,
but hey,

523
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:15.640
I'm a patriots fan.
If you guys are going to question our entire legacy,

524
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.960
cause we'd stole some signs and let a cuts hair with of air pressure out of a

525
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:23.110
fucking ball.
I mean,
you know,

526
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.310
you play every fucking game,
every hour,
every home game with that stadium.

527
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:31.450
I'm not going to break your balls back.
Fucking unbelievable.

528
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.420
They were stealing signs.
Yeah,
that's what she would do

529
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.760
anyways.
I'm telling you,

530
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.710
watch the Baylor Baylor bears.

531
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:45.100
You Watch when you see four people sending in signals simultaneously,

532
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:48.580
you realize everybody's fucking non on now it's just the patriot.
Okay.
Okay.

533
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.400
Santa Claus exists.
He's up there right now.

534
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:54.490
But those little fucking Elvis making a toy for your little fucking birdhouse

535
00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.350
doing for you to stick your fucking head in right to their little hole.
Um,

536
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.390
anyways,
but,
uh,
I'm loving the panthers man.
Uh,

537
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.620
watching them go on to feed it and it's also how great is it to watch Cam Newton

538
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:10.410
come into his own and he is like,
you know,
when Brady and Peyton Manning,

539
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.710
you're gone.
And,
uh,
I could the next wave please.

540
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:19.630
What Andrew Luck,
uh,
Steve,
Mary Ot,

541
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.880
whatever the fuck his name is up there in Seattle.

542
00:32:21.881 --> 00:32:24.530
I never know the names anymore.
I used to know the names.

543
00:32:24.531 --> 00:32:28.570
They used to collect football cards.
The guy was in two Superbowls in a row.
Uh,

544
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:31.870
what is,
what does the name Raymond Genie?
The fuck is his fucking name.

545
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.240
All I know is easy.
All I see is one story or another,

546
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:37.280
but I want have fucking boy scout.
He is,
I actually think he's still in there.

547
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:37.601
He's in the,

548
00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:41.000
we billows at this point and he's a football player and he actually got into

549
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:45.020
scouting after he started playing football.
That's how good a person he is.

550
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.900
Hardy called timeout last week to help an old lady get back up to a chair and

551
00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:50.860
the fucking upper deck.

552
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.820
That's the kind of person that's what this kid is made up of.

553
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.230
And I'll tell you right now,
Dan is contagious in the locker room.
Um,

554
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.480
the fuck is his now.
I can't,
I can't even fucking remember.
You know,

555
00:33:04.481 --> 00:33:07.780
you got that kid Jamieson down in Tampa.

556
00:33:07.781 --> 00:33:12.670
You got the other fucking dude there on uh,
titans.
But Cam Newton's a dude,
man.

557
00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.200
You know that guy.
He's the fucking belt.
We know this.

558
00:33:17.201 --> 00:33:18.100
What are you gonna tell us right now?

559
00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:20.920
Seattle is not the fuck is this a team that no one wants to run into when the

560
00:33:20.921 --> 00:33:21.754
fucking playoffs?

561
00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.160
That's another thing that they always said until you already know this is a

562
00:33:24.161 --> 00:33:26.590
torch.
17 and nobody wants to play.

563
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.850
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

564
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.120
<v 0>Like what's funny is they always say that nobody ever says,</v>

565
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:36.400
I don't want to play them.
Can imagine if a coach said that after a while.

566
00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.810
What do you got next week?
Oh,
we got the fucking,
uh,

567
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.550
we got the two and seven Jag was,
I'll tell you right now,
I don't want to play as

568
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.700
a coach.
Why don't you want to play him?

569
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.610
Cause they're the 217 that I don't want to play.

570
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.330
Why would you want to play the amount of money they make per game?

571
00:33:56.331 --> 00:33:58.970
I would fucking play anybody.
I'd take an ass kicking.
Go ahead.

572
00:33:58.971 --> 00:34:00.140
Beat the shit out of me.
I don't care.

573
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.450
Do you realize the Gucci ice bags that I can fucking buy for my body afterwards?

574
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.050
I'm fucking played a second.
My Boston Bruins,

575
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:11.660
my beloved Boston Bruins are uh,

576
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.850
working their way through a west coast trip right now.

577
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.250
I had to come from behind twice,

578
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:21.560
gets Edmonton and Calgary to get one point.
But uh,

579
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.610
you know the plane ride the plane.
All right.
I'm liking watching them.
Um,

580
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:30.040
and I got to tell you,
I keep threatening to do it,
but I have to do it.
Um,

581
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.570
because of a certain team.
I'm not going to try and drink some here,

582
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.190
but I'm going to get,
I got to get the NBA package.

583
00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:41.780
Um,
even if they don't break the record of undefeated,
the undefeated streak,

584
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.580
which I really would love for them to do.
Um,
you know,

585
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:47.510
come on man.
Stuff Korea,

586
00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:49.640
you get you gotta I gotta start watching this guy every night.

587
00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.940
Like back in the day,
you know what sucks is it didn't have the NHL package.

588
00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:55.970
So as much as I got to watch Wayne Gretzky,
I didn't get to watch the guy.

589
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.390
You know what I mean?
There was no national fucking game of the week.

590
00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:01.790
I had to wait till like Edmonton played the Bruins.

591
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.760
<v 2>MMM.</v>

592
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:05.721
<v 0>You don't want,</v>

593
00:35:05.721 --> 00:35:09.470
I'd have to watch the fucking highlights and you'd have to score like five

594
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:13.500
fucking goals for Bob Lubell the actually even talk about it because all they

595
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:16.670
would show is basically Bruins highlights and unless there was a bench clearing

596
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:17.481
brawl,
you wouldn't see it.

597
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:22.481
But the fact that you could watch somebody of Steph Curry's greatness night in

598
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:23.391
and night out,

599
00:35:23.391 --> 00:35:26.990
like the fact that as a sports fan that I'm not fucking doing that because I

600
00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:30.090
don't want to drop 100 bucks is a,

601
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:33.530
that's an excusable as Paul [inaudible] you would say from the verse,
he effect.

602
00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:37.310
It's unacceptable.
It's fucking unacceptable.

603
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.740
So,
um,
anyways,

604
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:44.640
I'll let still a story about the lady.

605
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.860
So anyways,
I um,
as you guys know,

606
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:53.970
I've been driving a Prius for a long fucking time for a long fucking time.

607
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:56.790
I got it in 2007.
All right.

608
00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:01.350
And the great thing about driving an eight year old paid off Prius is that it's

609
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:05.010
an eight year old pay off,
paid off,
Prius.
It's taken all the hits,

610
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.070
it's taken all the lumps.
It looks like a fucking prize fighter.

611
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:10.260
10 years after its fucking retired,
you know,

612
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.660
and you just see the scar tissue around the eyes.

613
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:16.290
You see the nose has been broken.
He can fucking park that thing.
Anyways.

614
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.483
So anyways,

615
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.410
for years I've had that and I've had the old 68 f 100,
you know what I mean?

616
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:27.600
So the Goto thing was,
um,
my Prius.

617
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:30.480
But if my wife needed the car and I had to drive to,

618
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.200
it became a situation because,
uh,
you know,

619
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:37.020
I don't want someone to steal my truck.
It's a classic car,
you know,

620
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.670
some asshole out here might take it.

621
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:42.690
So that was it always like questions of where I could take it at night.

622
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:48.150
And a lot of times I would end up just taking a cab.
So finally,
we've,

623
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:52.590
uh,
decided I actually went out and I got my wife,
you know,
I got her,

624
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:57.240
I got her a car.
All right.
Nothing too fancy.
But nonetheless,

625
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:01.470
it's fucking knew and she loves it,
right?
So now I drive the old car,

626
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.430
smart fucking move.
She drives to new one.
She's a happy,
she's all cushy.

627
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.910
You know what I mean?
He keeps them cushy.
He keep them happy.
All right?

628
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:11.100
And then when they come at you breaking your fucking balls,

629
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.590
he just fucking tear open the curtains.

630
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:17.040
It pointed the car with your eyebrows up.
That's

631
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.580
really what is the problem.
And then they get mad.
Do you know to do that?

632
00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:28.470
Just to bring it?
Yeah.
You tell.
Yeah.
You Dope.
Um,
so anyways,

633
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.930
you know me.
Okay.
And I'll go to big point of fucking doing that shit.
So I got,

634
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:37.830
you know,
I got a nice comfortable,
sensible fucking car,
you know,

635
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:40.850
with a couple of gadgets on it or whatever.
Right.
So anyway,

636
00:37:40.851 --> 00:37:42.510
so we decided we're going to take it out last night.

637
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.850
We're going to somebody's birthday fucking party.
And uh,

638
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.320
for whatever reason my wife goes,
hey,

639
00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:51.321
can we stop off at the supermarket and get flowers and I go fluff for what?

640
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.860
She goes,
well I feel weird,
you know,

641
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.830
showing up at a birthday party without like bringing anything.

642
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:03.660
I just feel like weird.
I go,
so why would you even get a flowers?

643
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:10.110
Like what was she sick in the hospital that somebody die,
you know,

644
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.560
what are you going to flowers fudge cause we just shut up and let's just go to

645
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:17.400
the supermarket cycle.
Fine.
I go,
you are driving,
right?
So she drives,

646
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.420
we could take her car and I said,
hey,
should we take the fucking beat up praise?

647
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.750
She goes,
no,
I want to drive.
The new guy said,
all right,
fine,
we'll do that.
Right?

648
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.020
So we drive down the fucking street and uh,

649
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.690
we pull into the grocery store and I'm immediately thinking,

650
00:38:30.691 --> 00:38:33.990
don't park next to anybody.
Please don't park next to anybody.
And Lo and behold,

651
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:38.170
she does it.
She goes,
okay.
She goes,
I take it.
You're not going in.
I've got no,

652
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:38.741
I'm not going in.

653
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:42.250
I'm going to come stand in line watching you hold flowers and then pay for them.

654
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.820
I'll never forget that.
I'll never get that six minutes back in my life.

655
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.930
I'm going to sit here and look at the scores on my phone.
So she says,
fine.

656
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.280
She goes into the grocery store and all of a sudden this dude fucking pulls up

657
00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:57.210
and he's piece of shit.
Beat up fucking card.

658
00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:02.220
It looks like a dinner roll just to classic four door sedan and his fucking wife

659
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:08.650
is in the passenger seat.
Now we're faced opposite ways,
you know what I mean?

660
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.800
We pulled straight,
uh,
we pulled in,
you know,

661
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:16.510
did that thing where there's two parking spots and you pull past the first one

662
00:39:16.511 --> 00:39:19.510
and into the next one.
So now it looks like you backed in,
but you drove into it.

663
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.750
They came in from the other side and parked right next to me,

664
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.640
like me and the lady,

665
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:28.150
we're going to start shooting the shit and she just opens the door until she

666
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:32.650
hits the car,
looks at me and closes the door.
It doesn't say anything.

667
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.390
<v 3>Okay.</v>

668
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.370
<v 0>Okay.
And I'm like,
what the fuck?</v>

669
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.730
So I want to open the door and say some,

670
00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:42.760
but the fucking dudes there and I'm so fucking mad,

671
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:47.650
there's no way for me to communicate to the woman in any sort of tone where he's

672
00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:51.430
not going to then have to fucking do will.
Yo,
what's your fucking problem?

673
00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.250
Okay.

674
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:58.250
And I just sat there and I just decided to just not say anything.

675
00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:00.700
<v 3>Okay.</v>

676
00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.000
<v 0>Because I've done it before and it gets you nowhere.</v>

677
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.350
All they do is they go fuck you and give you the finger and you get into a big

678
00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:11.280
fuck.
You fuck you screaming and yelling.

679
00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.720
They still open the fucking door into your car like what do I do?

680
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.810
So they fucking walked in there and it literally just like ruined my fucking

681
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:25.120
evening and I just was thinking like,
can you have anything nice?

682
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.300
Can you fucking have anything nice?
The fucking animals,

683
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.330
this people out there that literally when they get out of their car like that,

684
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:33.130
that's completely acceptable to them.

685
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.710
<v 3>Okay.</v>

686
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.950
<v 0>Cause it's all about them getting their fat ass out of the fucking car.</v>

687
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:41.160
That do they know that they've opened the door far enough when they hit your

688
00:40:41.161 --> 00:40:45.180
fucking car?
I had some women do that to me like,
like two,

689
00:40:45.181 --> 00:40:47.820
three years ago when my priests was actually still kind of new.

690
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:52.050
I was actually doing a phoner or I had a conference call and sit in my car.

691
00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:55.410
She pulls up next to me.
It just opens a door into my car,

692
00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.000
like poem then closes the door,
walks into the bank and I'm like,
what the fuck?

693
00:41:00.001 --> 00:41:02.340
But I'm on a conference call,
right,
talk and talk and talk,

694
00:41:02.341 --> 00:41:06.690
and she comes walking back from being in the bank,
opens the door,

695
00:41:06.691 --> 00:41:10.740
boom into my car again.
So I go,
I tell everybody on the phone,
I go,
hang on,

696
00:41:10.741 --> 00:41:15.360
I should have hit mute.
So I put the window down.
I go,
Hey,
I go,

697
00:41:15.361 --> 00:41:16.530
you just opened your door.

698
00:41:16.531 --> 00:41:20.760
And then my car on the way in and on the way out she just goes,
well,

699
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:25.750
did it leave a mark?
And I go,
I don't know.
Why don't you look,
wake and I,

700
00:41:25.751 --> 00:41:29.340
I said something,
something that I told it will wake up.
You know what she did?

701
00:41:29.341 --> 00:41:30.240
She goes,
she gives me,

702
00:41:30.241 --> 00:41:34.040
she stares at me for half a second and then gives me the finger and fuck you

703
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.740
like I'm the asshole.

704
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:41.900
And all I did for the rest of that conference call other than to apologize for

705
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:46.070
people,
for,
you know,
having them listen to that.

706
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:47.690
And then me of course looking like a lunatic.

707
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:48.950
You don't want him getting into business with,

708
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.493
<v 2>okay.</v>

709
00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:56.580
<v 0>All I could fantasize about doing was fucking following her home and just</v>

710
00:41:57.671 --> 00:42:01.350
absolutely destroying her car and I would lie to you,
it has point.

711
00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.180
I didn't think about taking a fucking extension cord,

712
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:09.010
wrapping it around her neck until right before she passed out and then let her

713
00:42:09.011 --> 00:42:09.820
up.

714
00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.560
<v 2>Okay?</v>

715
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.160
<v 0>That's how fucking annoyed I was.
You know what I mean?
Which is why yesterday,</v>

716
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.910
I'm a couple of years older and I was just like,
Bill,
don't say anything.

717
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.090
Because at the end of the day that if they did any damage,

718
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.550
they're not going to pay for it.
It's not going to stop.

719
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.930
She's not going to change,

720
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.280
and all you're going to do is possibly get into a situation where the other guy

721
00:42:29.281 --> 00:42:32.730
calls you out and says,
come on out here so I can beat the shit out of you,

722
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.790
and you're not going to get out of the car.
You're not going to fight this guy.

723
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.310
You have 47 years old.
You're going to go out there.

724
00:42:38.311 --> 00:42:41.730
You either going to lose or you're going to win and get sued and you're going to

725
00:42:41.731 --> 00:42:45.150
lose.
So you just have to sit here and fucking take it.

726
00:42:45.151 --> 00:42:46.860
And I sat in that fucking car

727
00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:52.810
just looking at their car,
thinking of like,
I just wanted to fucking like,

728
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.350
you know,
if the car was more of a piece of shit,

729
00:42:56.351 --> 00:42:59.290
I would just open the car door until they have fucking door.
But it's a new car,

730
00:42:59.291 --> 00:43:01.420
so I can't,
I can't do that.
Then I'm like,
what am I going to do?

731
00:43:01.421 --> 00:43:04.390
Am I going to kick the door?
Am I going to do it when they're not here?

732
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:05.380
That's a pussy move,

733
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.593
<v 2>you know?</v>

734
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.730
<v 0>I just,
it was,
there was no way to win.
So now I'm in a fucking mood,</v>

735
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.920
so then we drive over to go to the birthday party.

736
00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:14.330
It's the wrong fucking address.

737
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.840
Now I'm in more of a fucking mood by wife is fill in the fucking tension.

738
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.750
So I'm fucking trying to drive over to where we're supposed to be and all of a

739
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:24.020
sudden I can't make a left.
I'm going to pissed off mode.
Fuck you.

740
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:27.110
I'm taking a left,
as I go through the intersection and make a left,

741
00:43:27.111 --> 00:43:28.880
they look over to the right,
what's sitting there.

742
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.710
I'll fucking police car was fucking cops sitting right in.
And I'm like,
fuck,

743
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.180
you know,
I drive.
And of course he stomps on the gas way,

744
00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:40.670
overreaction to fucking drive.
Right.

745
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:44.240
But I was literally fucking 10 feet away from the guy turns on the fucking

746
00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:45.074
lights.

747
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:50.520
So I pull over and he goes,
uh,
dino,

748
00:43:50.521 --> 00:43:54.410
why I pulled you over?
No,
he walks up,
he goes,
do you know you can't,

749
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.190
you made a left back there at the light.
You know,
you can't do that.
I was like,

750
00:43:58.191 --> 00:44:02.380
yeah,
yeah,
I did.
I did know that.
I saw the sign and I did it anyways.

751
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.830
I was mad cause this woman opened the door into my new car.
Uh,

752
00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.890
and he goes,
I let me see your registration and you know,

753
00:44:09.891 --> 00:44:12.230
we're giving them the fucking shit and everything.
So he goes back,

754
00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:13.440
<v 2>okay,</v>

755
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.590
<v 0>you know,
I've got to break down a don't of cops when it comes to shit like that.</v>

756
00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.310
Do you know why I pulled you over?
We'll go blow.
Why?
Cause I,
yeah,
I know why.

757
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.020
I know why.
You know why and I know that you know,
then I know why.

758
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:26.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

759
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:30.970
<v 0>Oh,
I know.
You know,
so I just say,
yeah,
yeah,
I know why.</v>

760
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.090
Because I did that and I knew I wasn't supposed to do it.

761
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.350
I did it anyway because I was in a bad mood and they end up coming up to the car

762
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:41.130
and he was just like,
all right,
you know what?
I'm not gonna write you up,

763
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.200
but don't do that again.
And I said,
you gonna let me go.
And he goes,
well,

764
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:48.360
do you want me to give you a citation?
I'm like,
no.
He goes,

765
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:50.850
well then don't do it again.
I said,
all right,
thank you.
Thank you.

766
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:56.330
I put in the glove box and then I drove away and I looked at my wife and I did a

767
00:44:56.641 --> 00:45:00.920
fist pump and I went white.
Um,

768
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.420
I did do that,
but it did cross my mind that she was probably thinking like,

769
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:09.120
cause I want to be like,
you know,
I wanted to brag.
I see that you just be honest.

770
00:45:09.121 --> 00:45:12.990
And I know she's sitting there giving me those,
uh,
black lives matter eyes,

771
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.710
so I couldn't brag in that moment or what a fucking great move I just made,

772
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.190
you know?
Does that make any sense?
All right.

773
00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:24.210
Let me get to the questions for the week.
Uh,
I didn't do this right.

774
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:26.820
I do this every fucking week with my stupid combination.

775
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:30.260
I can't talk and do my combination the same fucking time.

776
00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:35.261
Just I just need you guys to be quiet and there it is.

777
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:40.350
There it is.
Okay.

829
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.550
here's an opportunity to do something nice for some people,
uh,

830
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.580
during the holiday season.
All right.
Children's hospital information.

831
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:57.910
A comedian Steve Sumome,

a lot of his free time there.

834
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.530
Uh,
he's had the chance to meet some great kids.

835
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.620
It's really rough spots and Steve's goal is to keep them in good spirits and

836
00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:15.760
make sure they have as much fun as any kid should have.
During this time.
Uh,

837
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:19.270
there were a few kids in particular has become particularly close with as they

838
00:49:19.271 --> 00:49:22.060
need some serious help.
So here we go.
Um,

839
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:23.980
there's a kid William who's battling cancer.

840
00:49:23.981 --> 00:49:25.480
His mother is recovering from cancer.

841
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:28.660
His father was recently in a car accident and is on disability.

842
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:30.940
This is not a good times episode.

843
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:34.690
I swear to God this is actually happening to somebody,
uh,
that no,
no.

844
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:37.450
Live as soon,
soon they're going to be homeless.
All right,

845
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:41.140
so the money raised will go directly towards paying their rent and making sure

846
00:49:41.141 --> 00:49:44.680
they have a home at least through the holidays.
Um,

847
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.840
the kid with cancer is only four years old.

848
00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:51.460
He suffers from a rare disease called Ald last week.
Oh God,
this is brutal.

849
00:49:51.461 --> 00:49:54.490
Last week he received a second bone marrow transplant.
Uh,

850
00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.770
this Christmas when he wakes up in the hospital,

851
00:49:56.771 --> 00:49:59.590
we want to have them surrounded by toys.
And,
uh,

852
00:49:59.591 --> 00:50:03.730
I have no doubt that Santa is real and I'm actually have a home to go back to.

853
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:07.060
So now I got all the sadness out of the way.
Um,

854
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.450
I'm going to share a link on Facebook and Twitter,
you know,
donate a dollar.

855
00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:13.750
Whatever you can do.
We've already raised 1000 bucks.

856
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.900
Our goal is only three grant.
Uh,

857
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:20.910
the new goal is somewhere north of 10 grand if we can so they can actually stay

858
00:50:21.791 --> 00:50:23.880
there for the entire year.
Um,

859
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.670
all the money will go directly to the quality of life.
Um,
items for the kids.

860
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:32.120
No middle man.
We'll give updates and a whatever you guys donate.

861
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.200
I'm going to try to match,

862
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:37.520
unless she fucking sent some ridiculous amount of fucking money that I,
you know,

863
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:39.830
what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I'm out and I'm going to go bankrupt here.

864
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:43.270
All right,
but I'm going to throw on a sizable bottom money to,
uh,
wait,

865
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.800
do we have the fucking link?
Oh,

866
00:50:45.801 --> 00:50:49.430
we're going to share the link on Facebook and on Twitter.
All right,
there we go.

867
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:52.340
Sorry about that guys.
I usually don't do stuff like that,
but it is a,

868
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.640
it is a great thing to do.
Um,
and unlike a lot of charities,

869
00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:57.920
this is actually going to go directly to the people that need the help,

870
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.850
which is what I've always said here on this podcast as opposed to going into the

871
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:06.550
pink twat infrastructure and getting reduced and then spitting out,
you know,

872
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.120
a couple of coins on the other side.

873
00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:11.090
This is actually going to go directly to this,
uh,
this wonderful family.

874
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:15.860
All right.
All right,
here we go.
Questions for the week?
Uh,

875
00:51:15.861 --> 00:51:17.300
hockey and football bill,

876
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.210
who's your on to dog pick for the Stanley Cup this year?

877
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:24.320
All the Boston Bruins were going to gel right after the all star break.

878
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:29.370
Uh,
the underdog.
Well you can't say the kings or the Black Hawks.

879
00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.320
Guys have so fucking busy.
I can't give you an intelligent one.

880
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:37.700
I would underdog would be,
uh,
maybe the Canadians,

881
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.810
they definitely have the goaltender,
but I just,
I don't believe in the east,

882
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:44.690
the eastern conference.
Um,

883
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:47.280
<v 3>yeah,</v>

884
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.300
<v 0>I guess in underdog,</v>

885
00:51:48.301 --> 00:51:51.000
what I would say it would be the Dallas stars if they had enough in the tank to

886
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:53.490
get past,
well you figure,
hopefully with any luck

887
00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:58.300
the Blackhawks and kings would face each other and they'd knock wanting one or

888
00:51:58.301 --> 00:52:01.220
the other out.
But I don't think that's going to happen.
They probably would be,

889
00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:05.700
you know,
top two seeds.
So you'll probably have to go through both of them.
Uh,

890
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.770
yeah.
Maybe Dallas Stars,

891
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:10.820
Dallas Stars in the West and then I would say the fucking Canadians in the tub

892
00:52:10.821 --> 00:52:15.620
out that.
Yeah,
there's two safe pics.
All right.
Um,
some people think Casey.

893
00:52:15.621 --> 00:52:18.580
Oh,
how about the Superbowl's?
Some people think Casey's d could,

894
00:52:18.581 --> 00:52:21.590
they could get them far.
Casey's not winning shit.

895
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.130
Then I went in the fucking super bowl.
Cincinnati is not winning it.

896
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:28.850
Then I went in there.
I think it's coming in the west.
I think if the packers,

897
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.713
I dunno,

898
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.280
how do you not say the fucking Carolina Panthers?

899
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:39.050
I know they're like a young team,
but like I believe in Cam Newton swagger.

900
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.830
I don't think it's an act like that dude in Seattle is always jumping up and

901
00:52:42.831 --> 00:52:45.920
down,
screaming and yell and say,
and I'll fucking Grady is,
to me,

902
00:52:45.921 --> 00:52:48.330
that's a massive inferiority complex that he,

903
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.370
that he compensates with a huge fucking ego.
Right.

904
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.700
I think Patrick painters sins every bit is good.
Is Sherman,
you know,

905
00:52:55.701 --> 00:52:59.430
he doesn't need to jump around.
He just fucking does his job.
Um,

906
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:04.620
maybe he's got to scream like that because it's so loud in that stadium.
Um,

907
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.360
anyways,
I liked the panthers.
I believe in Cam Newton.

908
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.230
I don't think he's afraid of the fucking moment.
I just think that,
yeah,

909
00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:13.280
<v 5>droid.
No,
you go ahead.
We'll go over that.</v>

910
00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:15.860
Go to coffee as you enter your new moon.
Moomoo

911
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.090
<v 0>even though they were undefeated and not really like an underdog.</v>

912
00:53:19.091 --> 00:53:21.640
But I think in a lot of ways people are gonna think that they're an underdog

913
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:25.000
because Seattle,
you got to respect them.
They weren't there the last two fucking,

914
00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.240
and who's kidding who,
if they handed it off to Marshawn Lynch,

915
00:53:28.241 --> 00:53:31.090
where we really going to stop him again?
You know,

916
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.250
they fucked it up.

917
00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:37.900
They screwed the pooch last year slash Malcolm Butler make one of the great

918
00:53:37.901 --> 00:53:40.150
defensive plays of all fucking time.

919
00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:43.850
I'm still wasn't a bad call as far as,
uh,

920
00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:47.950
considering it 60% of the time it was a touchdown.
The other 40%,

921
00:53:47.951 --> 00:53:49.360
it was like incomplete passes.

922
00:53:49.361 --> 00:53:51.250
That was the only interception of the Goddamn year.

923
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.260
<v 2>MMM.</v>

924
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.720
<v 0>And I would feel bad for Pete Carroll,
but,
uh,
as a patriots fan,</v>

925
00:53:57.721 --> 00:54:00.400
because he doesn't get shit for being a fucking cheater,
uh,

926
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:03.240
and we do then I don't,
I don't have any sympathy for them,

927
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:07.770
so fuck 'em all sneaky Pete.
He could get in there again.
Um,

928
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.820
<v 2>okay.</v>

929
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.541
<v 0>Yeah,
I,
so I,</v>

930
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:14.660
I still think in a weird way that the panthers are an underdog just because a,

931
00:54:14.661 --> 00:54:18.650
they are a young team.
Um,
and I'm going to be safe.
I have no fucking idea.

932
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:22.820
What do you want me to say?
Tampa,
do I really,
I don't believe in anything.

933
00:54:22.821 --> 00:54:27.350
I think that the,
uh,
the Patriots are in trouble unless we get healthy,
obviously.

934
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.070
Uh,
I mean we lost to the Broncos without fucking Peyton manning.

935
00:54:31.071 --> 00:54:34.500
So I think that kind of lets you know where we're at right now.
Um,

936
00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.490
so I dunno,
I don't fucking,
I don't fuck guys and I don't watch it to that level.

937
00:54:40.491 --> 00:54:42.140
I have no fucking idea.
What else did he ask me?

938
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:43.993
<v 2>MMM.</v>

939
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.730
<v 0>I Dunno if I'm,
I'm really becoming a panthers fan though.
I liked the panthers.</v>

940
00:54:48.731 --> 00:54:53.620
I'd like to saints,
I don't know what it is.
So fucking set the NFC south,

941
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.400
I don't know what to fucking teams those are,
but I,

942
00:54:55.401 --> 00:54:58.630
I really liked both of them and I'm liking the fact that Tampa Bay's getting

943
00:54:58.631 --> 00:54:59.464
good.

944
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:00.653
<v 2>MMM.</v>

945
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.741
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

946
00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:04.350
I like New People that are good and I just always liked the saints because they

947
00:55:04.351 --> 00:55:06.660
suck my whole life and I love that fucking city.

948
00:55:06.661 --> 00:55:11.640
And I also think the superdome's is one of the original domes out there.

949
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:14.030
One of the great ones.
And uh,
I,

950
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.240
they refurbished the whole thing and it's the shit now it's got the Mercedes

951
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.920
Benz emblem on the side of,
it's so many,

952
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:23.520
that stadiums or the jobbing.com and these fucking horrific names,

953
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.590
they get the Mercedes Benz emblem on it.
That's,
it's the shit.
So anyways,

954
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.330
there you go.
How about that?
I danced around that.

955
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.790
Just should I just exposed myself for how little football I've watched this
year.

956
00:55:34.791 --> 00:55:39.330
But fucking busy.
I've got this cartoon coming out,
man.
This is my shot.

957
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.600
All right.
Ah,
car shopping.
Billie or Billie?

958
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.930
I'm shopping around for a car for my wife as well.

959
00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.070
Me and my friends were talking about what the first question should be for the

960
00:55:52.071 --> 00:55:56.450
salesman.
Do you have a first question?
Uh,
yeah,
I'll steal with my brother says,

961
00:55:56.451 --> 00:56:00.950
yeah,
whatever his name is.
Hey Randy,
what's the real price on this car?
He goes,

962
00:56:00.951 --> 00:56:04.550
I feel like it sets a precedent for the whole wheeling and dealing my top

963
00:56:04.551 --> 00:56:08.570
choices.
How much under our invoice can you sell me this car?

964
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.950
Uh,
I've paid under invoice.
It's not a crazy thing.

965
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.980
Lots of times.
Um,
oh,

966
00:56:15.981 --> 00:56:18.920
you're saying like before the options you've paid under that,

967
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:22.070
but what the fuck were you buying and when did you buy it?
I've never done that.

968
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.430
My big line is what's the out the door price and buy out the door.
I mean,

969
00:56:27.431 --> 00:56:30.010
everything.
The warranty,
the tax,
everything,

970
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:34.750
the final number that I'm paying you and I,
and I just have the number.

971
00:56:34.751 --> 00:56:38.230
I just go.
I always do.
What I always do is I always go,

972
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:43.630
I always pitch like two grand above.
Is it called steaks?
What not,

973
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:48.550
not the,
not the one after all the options.
It's that first number before the ad,

974
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:53.170
the options.
I always,
I always go to grand,
um,

975
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.850
above that number and I'm probably still getting fucked.
I always get like,

976
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:02.680
I always get half a dick fucking thrown my way.
I always do,
you know?

977
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.990
Um,
I always get fucked a little bit,
but I actually enjoy the process.

978
00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:12.850
Like I have fun with it.
Um,
each time I get fucked a little bit less like I did,

979
00:57:12.851 --> 00:57:16.420
I did real well on this one I felt.
And uh,
but who knows,

980
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.790
you always feel like you're going to turn around and see them all laughing,

981
00:57:18.791 --> 00:57:22.120
slapping each other on the back,
and then they're going to quickly stop and,
uh,

982
00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:25.780
but you know,
sharpen a pencil as you look at him,
you know,
you know,

983
00:57:25.781 --> 00:57:29.900
after you leave.
But,
uh,
I,
I would just,
I dunno,
uh,

984
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.020
read up on it and watched some youtube videos.

985
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.120
I had a lot of fun this time cause I didn't give a fuck and I wasn't trading in

986
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.150
the Prius.
So I just kept saying that.
He just kept saying,
listen dude,

987
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:43.180
like we'd like to buy this car but we don't need to.

988
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.050
I mean I can get in that car right there and it drives great man.
It's a Toyota,

989
00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:50.920
you know,
I've kept it maintained.
It's all beat up.
I can park it.

990
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:52.960
Nobody's going to steal a fucking eight year old Prius.

991
00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:57.310
It's God damn gem out there.
So I had the guy laugh and so I go,
look,

992
00:57:57.311 --> 00:57:59.870
this is what I want.
Right?
So he goes and he fucking,
you know,

993
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.820
grab acids with his manager,
comes back,
he's not even close.

994
00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:06.490
So he comes back with this big grin on his face.
He goes,
nuts area and this,

995
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:11.500
this is a great deal.
This is a great deal.
And I just go,
Pho,
pho,
you,

996
00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:14.590
I mean,
I'm not gonna lie to you at this point.
If you look around the table,

997
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:18.700
you're the only guy smiling.
Then he kind of like,
Hey,
I go,
I can't pay that.

998
00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.840
I can't pay.
I got to check in my pocket right fucking now I will.

999
00:58:22.841 --> 00:58:26.530
I will and I to tell him life too.
You know and you always got to send your wife.

1000
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.650
If you bring your wife is a good thing cause they think it's a weakness,
right?

1001
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.760
Okay.

1002
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.970
You got to get your wife on the same page and at some point you got to tell your

1003
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:37.780
wife to screw.
Okay?
You do it in a respectable way.
But with the,

1004
00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:42.220
with the Dash Archie bunker,
be like honey,
guilt,
go uh,
do me a favor.

1005
00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:44.580
Could you just go a cold look over the cars over there,
Bubba,

1006
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.590
you make it look like he got this old school fucking relationship.

1007
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:50.920
Like she actually has dinner prepared when you come home.
All right?

1008
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.890
And as much as your wife isn't going to like in that moment,
that feeling,

1009
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:58.420
it works good for you in the negotiation because now it gives you this guy the

1010
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:00.430
perception debt.

1011
00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:04.030
You actually are making decisions and your relationship cause they buy on the

1012
00:59:04.031 --> 00:59:07.170
fact that the emotion of the female,
but I like it

1013
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:12.010
right when you send them off,
it just speaks like,
look,

1014
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:15.340
I want to get this car for my wife.
All right,
but I'm not a dope.

1015
00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:20.560
This is what I'm paying.
Okay,
this is what I am paying.
I willing to pay this.

1016
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:24.110
If you get me this number,
I'm going to buy this car today.

1017
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:27.410
You're going to make a sale and you're never going to have to look at this car

1018
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:31.670
again.
That's the deal.
That's my number.
Okay.

1019
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:37.700
Do my brother's amazing at it.
He always comes in his,
his line is,
he comes in,

1020
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:38.571
you know,
just,

1021
00:59:38.571 --> 00:59:42.980
he always gets the guy's name and I feel like that gives him power.
It'd be like,

1022
00:59:42.981 --> 00:59:46.460
what's your name?
And I gotta be like a Steven.
And he goes,
Steve,

1023
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:47.720
and you see this right here.

1024
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:51.380
This is a large coffee and extra large coffee as he says,

1025
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:53.150
you know why it got this?
He goes,

1026
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:56.780
cause this is going to be a long negotiation until I'm going to get what I want.

1027
00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:03.100
He comes hard right out of the fucking gate and he's like a fucking a comic that

1028
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:07.460
never stops writing.
I used,
when we were kids,

1029
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:12.490
we used to go down to a car dealerships and pretend that we were going to

1030
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:17.681
fucking is way back in the 80s we used to pretend that we were going to a buy a

1031
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:21.890
car so we could test drive all these cars.

1032
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:24.260
And my brother used to just fuck with all these salesmen.

1033
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:27.640
I used to do with him and I still with another one of my one on another,

1034
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:31.910
one of my friends one day we skipped school high school and we went down and we

1035
01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:35.390
said that we were seniors in high school,
which we were.
We said we were,

1036
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:39.560
we were stepbrothers.
It was hilarious.
You know I had like fucking fire engine,

1037
01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:44.420
red hair and my bought,
my buddy was like fucking six to you know,

1038
01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.140
look like a movie star doll,
tall,
dark,
handsome.
We look nothing alike.

1039
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:51.950
So he said we was stepbrothers and initially the salesman looks at us like,

1040
01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:54.590
what the fuck?
And we said that a,

1041
01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:58.760
we were both going to be going to the same college next year and that our

1042
01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:01.520
parents were going to buy us a,
uh,

1043
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:05.300
buys a vehicle to share and they're both really busy.

1044
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.630
And they told us to come down and,
uh,
pick out a car.

1045
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:12.350
So immediately they thought that we were a couple of fucking rich kids and that

1046
01:01:12.351 --> 01:01:16.180
we didn't know shit.
So,
you know,
we went down,
we took out a Christ low laser.

1047
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.520
I remember we took out the Chrysler laser and I think that that guy actually

1048
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:22.010
knew no,
the Lebaron,
it was like the Lebaron.

1049
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.860
I remember the big deal was it had a digital speedometer,

1050
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:28.250
which we thought was fucking amazing.
And like fucking 1986 or seven,

1051
01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:31.910
whenever the fuck we did it.
So,
um,
my biggest thing,
and,
and,

1052
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.910
and the thing that I learned is when you go in there,

1053
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.670
you have to be prepared to walk.

1054
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.110
You have to know the number that you're going to pay.
And,
um,

1055
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.880
and to definitely go in there and have fun and,
uh,
when that,

1056
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.120
when the salesman tries to buddy buddy with you and do all that type of shit,

1057
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:52.550
I mean,
I don't list a couple of different ways you can play it.

1058
01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:55.440
You can laugh along with them or you can just kind of stare back at them.

1059
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:59.450
It just literally do.
My brother would literally just be like,
uh,
like Steve,

1060
01:01:59.451 --> 01:02:02.450
I'm not here to try to like,
you know,
listen to jokes.

1061
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.800
Like this isn't a funny thing here.

1062
01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:06.860
I know what goes on down here and I don't want to be a part of it.

1063
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.870
You understand?
This is what I'm paying

1064
01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:14.150
and in like to the hub is this is an extra large coffee.

1065
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.830
Do you know why I got this?

1066
01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:19.850
Because this is going to be a long drawn out negotiation.
I get what I want.

1067
01:02:19.851 --> 01:02:24.470
I said,
fucking classic.
Um,
all right.
So once again,

1068
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.500
I really didn't give you any information.
I'm still learning what to do,

1069
01:02:27.501 --> 01:02:30.650
but I used to be really intimidated by it.
But this last one,

1070
01:02:30.651 --> 01:02:33.080
somewhere in the middle of the negotiation,
my wife's car,

1071
01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.270
I actually really started having fun and realize the power that I had.
And,

1072
01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.490
um,
I just said,
I'm not paying any more than this.

1073
01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.780
I'm not paying any more than this.

1074
01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.460
And then I got the number that I wanted and then I,

1075
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:51.040
I went and then when I went to get the warranty,

1076
01:02:51.041 --> 01:02:54.670
they tack that on and I was like dope.
And then they tacked on the tax out.

1077
01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:58.120
So I ended up getting fucking two right there,
Fred.
So I still got fucked.

1078
01:02:58.930 --> 01:02:59.763
<v 2>But now I know,</v>

1079
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:04.450
<v 0>I know for the next time it's like bombing is a comedian.
So I had him,</v>

1080
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.250
I had him dead to rights and we let off the hook.
So I still,

1081
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:13.510
I still,
I've still got fucked.
Um,
but you know,

1082
01:03:13.511 --> 01:03:18.160
at least this time I had fun.
Um,
so watch,
watch out for that.
I would just say,

1083
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.970
you know,

1084
01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:21.970
no the number that you want and make sure you just say the out the door price

1085
01:03:21.971 --> 01:03:25.570
and make sure that you say that this includes the warranty and all the bullshit.

1086
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.800
And the tax,
everything.
This is the final fucking number.
I walk out,

1087
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:32.920
I get the car.
You washed it,
the whole God damn thing.

1088
01:03:32.921 --> 01:03:37.700
This is the number you have to say that repeatedly,
repeatedly.
Um,

1089
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.960
and that's where I fucked up.
All right.
You know what?
I'm man enough to admit it.

1090
01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.240
All right.
Thanksgiving Pie.
Oh,
Billy.
Oh,
speaking of which everybody,
I made the,

1091
01:03:46.241 --> 01:03:50.920
uh,
the pie crust video like promised the pie crust video has been made.

1092
01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:56.090
Um,
I dressed up like a baker.
Um,

1093
01:03:56.450 --> 01:04:00.340
we went all out so that things should be edited and done in the next couple of

1094
01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.550
days.
So hopefully at towards the end of the week,
um,

1095
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:08.350
you can watch old Billy freckles fucking make a pie crust and you can maybe a,

1096
01:04:08.351 --> 01:04:11.650
I dunno,
maybe show another side of yourself.

1097
01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:17.350
Maybe you have that beautiful woman,
you know,
the Sally to your hairy,
right.

1098
01:04:17.351 --> 01:04:21.360
All of a sudden see you was something else.
All of a sudden there's Mistletoe,

1099
01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:21.641
you know,

1100
01:04:21.641 --> 01:04:24.820
she had a slice of pie to sugars going through the roof or emotions are a little

1101
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.420
options.
Know what she's thinking.
You move in.
And next thing you know,

1102
01:04:28.421 --> 01:04:30.100
she decides to spend her life with you.

1103
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.980
<v 2>All right?
That poor woman,</v>

1104
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:36.831
<v 0>you guys ever hear that?</v>

1105
01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:41.120
Tears for fears a women woman and chain women had chains for a woman and change

1106
01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.130
something like that.

1107
01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:45.950
My drum teacher was telling me about because Phil Collins plays drums and he

1108
01:04:45.951 --> 01:04:47.780
plays his great drum fill in the end.

1109
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1110
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:52.240
<v 0>You know both like a minute left to something where he just goes over the bar</v>

1111
01:04:52.241 --> 01:04:55.720
line and ends on the endo one and it's just classic fucking awesome.

1112
01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:56.620
Phil Collins Drum,

1113
01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:02.400
drum fill to that song is the most pandering fucking song I've ever heard of my

1114
01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:07.560
fucking life written by a guy to women in general.

1115
01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.550
It's just like we are not get enough pussy at the end of your fucking show.

1116
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:14.643
<v 2>Ah,</v>

1117
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.330
<v 0>when he starts singing,
so free</v>

1118
01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:20.120
<v 3>her.
Okay.</v>

1119
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:24.250
<v 0>Okay.
And at one point he just starts going,
man,
a stone,</v>

1120
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.960
no stone men or stone

1121
01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.690
unfucking believable manage shit.
It's just so fucking,

1122
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:40.050
I listened to that song blown away by Phil Collins Drumming while laughing

1123
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:44.650
hysterically.
The way he says men are stone.

1124
01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:46.780
He sounds like he's going to start crying.

1125
01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:48.050
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1126
01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:51.620
<v 0>You know what I mean?
I don't know.
I mean,
I got a lot of nerve,</v>

1127
01:05:51.621 --> 01:05:54.680
all the sexist shit that I say,
but it just,
I don't know.
But I mean,

1128
01:05:54.681 --> 01:05:56.120
it's another reason why I fucking do it.

1129
01:05:56.150 --> 01:06:00.470
There's nobody policing the other fucking side,
but I guess it is a guy doing it,

1130
01:06:00.471 --> 01:06:01.304
so I dunno.

1131
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:03.933
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1132
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:06.980
<v 0>I don't,
he's a weird looking guy anyways.
Even though he's a fucking rock star,</v>

1133
01:06:06.981 --> 01:06:09.380
you still had to fucking distilled to put the whole fucking,

1134
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.470
please get me some pussy out there.
Anyways,
Thanksgiving Pie,

1135
01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:15.830
Billy boy begged a couple of Pumpkin pies after being inspired by your recent

1136
01:06:15.831 --> 01:06:19.190
podcast that was invited to a friend's house for Thanksgiving and there happened

1137
01:06:19.191 --> 01:06:21.350
to be a really cool girl there.
Well,
let me tell you,

1138
01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:25.070
it didn't hurt that I was the guy who made the pie.
That's what I'm telling you.

1139
01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:26.840
That's what I'm telling you.

1140
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:29.930
This is weird thing about women where they want you to be a guy,

1141
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:31.550
but as much as a fucking,

1142
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.510
if you just show that on some level that she can all see you're not afraid to

1143
01:06:35.511 --> 01:06:37.880
look like a pussy.
I don't know what it is.

1144
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.360
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1145
01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.770
<v 0>It melts them a little bit.
He goes,
uh,
the compliments started building up.</v>

1146
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.340
I brushed them off like it was no big deal.
That's the way you play it.

1147
01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.550
You Go Patrick Peterson,
you don't go Richard Sherman like that was fun,

1148
01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.330
but you don't do that shit.
It is.
Yeah.
You know,
it's my job.
It's what I do.

1149
01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.520
So questions came in like,
do you bake?
A lot were answered with,
no,

1150
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.810
this was just a first attempt.
Hopefully they'll,
they'll get better.
Ah,
Dude,

1151
01:07:06.811 --> 01:07:09.840
you're crushing it.
Good man.

1152
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:14.760
He goes to which the crowd responded with,
get Outta here.
Oh my God,

1153
01:07:14.761 --> 01:07:17.010
it's great.
Uh,
let's do,
it's just real.

1154
01:07:17.011 --> 01:07:21.660
And I'm in the fish are jumping into the boat at this point.
I love this guy.

1155
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.610
He goes talking to the girl later was much easier and came off totally

1156
01:07:26.611 --> 01:07:29.670
competent.
Uh,
I would though I thought would say natural.
Uh,

1157
01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:33.030
what girl doesn't want to know slash data guy who could pull that off.

1158
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:37.260
Thanks for the assist.
Somebody scored a goal at night.

1159
01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.680
He's eaten up.
It's going on a little bit of a run.
See that?

1160
01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:43.200
I'm telling you right now,
all of that stuff member,
that bit he used to do.

1161
01:07:43.201 --> 01:07:45.570
What do you have fig?
How guys always say that?

1162
01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:50.280
Anytime you do anything remotely like that,
I'm telling you right?
Fuck it.

1163
01:07:50.281 --> 01:07:54.740
Who gives a shit what?
What your guy friends are saying,

1164
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:56.490
okay,

1165
01:07:56.490 --> 01:08:01.350
I'm telling you right now it's women love that shit.

1166
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.480
They love that shit.
If you have a garden,
oh,
make every guy in the podcast,
right?

1167
01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:09.410
And I'll be like,
oh,
just make feel uncomfortable as a man.

1168
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.570
Do you ever fucking garden?
Right?

1169
01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:15.060
If you fucking know how to bake,

1170
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:19.250
what is something else?
You know what I mean?

1171
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:22.490
If you actually learned how to sew when you sewed a button back on your shirt,

1172
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:26.060
I don't know how you weave that into conversation.
I don't have those skills.

1173
01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.650
But if they knew that you know how to,

1174
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:32.651
so like they just find that the last thing they want is another chance to talk

1175
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:38.840
to another fucking guy sitting there with the bud tall talking about why the

1176
01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:42.980
Patriots,
it's good that they're 14 and to basically everything that I do.

1177
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.620
Yeah.
The last thing they did,
Doug,
no book,

1178
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:52.490
GL dog.
Oh,
he's on my fantasy team.

1179
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:56.600
Like that's literally I item,
I can't speak for women,

1180
01:08:56.601 --> 01:09:00.560
but I would think that them hearing that is literally like you approaching a

1181
01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:04.160
woman where you're like,
oh my God,
she's beautiful.
And as she walked up,

1182
01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:05.840
she's going like,
oh my God,

1183
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:10.790
the real housewives car dash had no shoes on sow and you just Amelie's as good

1184
01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.750
luck.
Your Dick just fucking starts looking the other way.
Like,
Nah man,

1185
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.190
I can't tell.
I mean I do it.
It was good.
No,
but you know

1186
01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:22.580
one and done when it's done.
This is not a home and home.
Okay.
All right.

1187
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.220
Girlfriend had sex with another guy.
Oh Geez.
You use a pill.

1188
01:09:28.221 --> 01:09:33.020
I'm a huge fan of yours from the country of Georgia,
not the state.

1189
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.590
All right.
I know where that is in eastern Europe.
Um,

1190
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:39.890
is that that cluster of countries?
Uh,

1191
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.460
well that's the one that rush every once in a while when they get annoyed,

1192
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:45.320
they drive a couple of tanks until it isn't,
it

1193
01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.660
isn't that every country over there in the eastern block.
All right,
here we go.

1194
01:09:50.661 --> 01:09:54.830
So here's my story.
I have a girlfriend.
We know each other almost.
Oh,

1195
01:09:54.831 --> 01:09:59.180
I love these guys.
We know each other almost five years and we've been friends,

1196
01:09:59.210 --> 01:09:59.990
all of these,

1197
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:03.890
all of these times until we discovered our mutual love and affection.

1198
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:08.440
Is there anything better than the way fucking people in Eastern Europe speak?

1199
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:11.030
Are they first of all,
and they speak in English with this tremendous,

1200
01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.450
it's amazing.
I wish I could be bilingual.
I just don't have the fucking patients.

1201
01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:18.230
Um,
and I also love that they don't have the word for the,
so they don't use it.

1202
01:10:18.231 --> 01:10:21.500
And it just makes everything sound so much for so much more direct.

1203
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.970
We've been friends all these times until we discovered our mutual love,

1204
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.040
affection four months ago.
And now she is my girlfriend.
I study in Poland,

1205
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:35.330
she studies in Germany,
so that means we don't see each other frequently,

1206
01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:39.710
but we had our business time a lot.
I think that's means banging each other.

1207
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:45.130
A few days ago my girlfriend told me that she was on MD m a oh,

1208
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:48.410
that's a drug I guess,
but to be clear,

1209
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:53.530
drug did not pulled the trigger for her to make such a thing.

1210
01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:59.230
I'm sorry man.
I'm trying to help.
I'm trying to go with your English era.

1211
01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.640
I don't know.
I know Mtma isn't,
isn't that?

1212
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:06.170
Well DMTs at one that makes you fucking go into another dimension.

1213
01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:11.210
I know an MDM a is,
I don't want to know.
Anyways.
Uh,

1214
01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:16.180
my girlfriend told me she was on MD a the previous night and had sex with a

1215
01:11:16.181 --> 01:11:17.650
random fucking guy.

1216
01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.390
She was crying and shaming herself on the phone telling me that she is wrong,

1217
01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:25.930
loves me.
I'm the special one for her and she told me that.

1218
01:11:25.931 --> 01:11:30.880
Now it's my decision how our relationship will go on.
Bill,

1219
01:11:30.881 --> 01:11:33.760
I want to hear your advice on on these point.

1220
01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.710
The thing is that I really love her and my love is higher than that fucking

1221
01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:42.910
sexual act,
which she had with that random fucking dude.
Bill,

1222
01:11:42.911 --> 01:11:47.911
I want to hear your advice and what would be your approach in my position?

1223
01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:50.650
Fuck you and eat a bag of shit.

1224
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:56.920
Ps lovey from Georgia country,
not the state.
And sorry for my grammar mistakes.

1225
01:11:56.921 --> 01:12:00.090
Dude.
You crushed your fucking English.
I can't do that.
I,

1226
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:04.210
I could barely write that well in my own my own language.
All right.

1227
01:12:04.211 --> 01:12:08.680
What to do here,
what to do,
what to do.
Um,
all right.

1228
01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:11.980
Obviously my gut just says you got to get rid of her.

1229
01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.880
Uh,
you know,
when you're not around,
she's going to be on drugs,

1230
01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:18.310
going to raves and fucking a random guy.

1231
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:20.263
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1232
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:23.640
<v 0>She does give points for actually telling you that.</v>

1233
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:29.130
Uh,
I,

1234
01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.350
I mean I,
I don't,
I don't know what to do.
This is hard.

1235
01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:36.500
This is hard because you said that you actually love her and to the level that

1236
01:12:36.501 --> 01:12:38.000
you could look past that.
But Dude,

1237
01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.310
I would say watch casino and see deniros relationship was Sharon Stone.
I mean,

1238
01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:49.520
do you have a potential for getting involved in that?
Um,

1239
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:56.930
I don't know if you can forgive somebody for that.
Uh,

1240
01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.660
okay.
But if it happens again,

1241
01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:02.150
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1242
01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.700
<v 0>Um,
you guys don't live near each other</v>

1243
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:10.820
and then she goes to raves and does drugs and fuck somebody.

1244
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:16.160
Um,
dude,
I think he had the very least.
You need to take a break.

1245
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:23.390
I think maybe you should just take a break and be like,
I need to sort this out.

1246
01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.820
And when she says why,
and it'd be like,
well,

1247
01:13:25.821 --> 01:13:30.260
because what you did fucked me up so bad that I had to send an email to a

1248
01:13:30.261 --> 01:13:33.950
podcast on the other side of the planet to try and get advice.

1249
01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:38.530
That's why.
So,
um,

1250
01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.750
you sound like you're young.
She sounds like she's young.

1251
01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:49.120
God knows his plenty of fish in the sea that wouldn't do fucking whatever the

1252
01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:50.810
fuck she just did.

1253
01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:53.123
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1254
01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:59.100
<v 0>I gotta put this back in your court,
dude.
Like,
just being aware,</v>

1255
01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:03.700
I'm sitting and the fact that there's does distance between the two of you.

1256
01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:07.030
I just don't see this thing working out.
You're in Poland.

1257
01:14:07.031 --> 01:14:09.460
She's in Germany and while in Germany goes to a party,

1258
01:14:09.461 --> 01:14:13.090
does drugs and fuck somebody else.
Um,

1259
01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.190
<v 2>okay.</v>

1260
01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:17.270
<v 0>I Dunno.
That's just sounds like the tip of the iceberg do.</v>

1261
01:14:17.271 --> 01:14:21.760
And I think you got to pull the cord.
That's what I would say as a friend.

1262
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:25.780
And I think if I was in that situation,
you would say that to me too,

1263
01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:31.360
because you weren't emotionally involved in it.
However,
people are human.

1264
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:35.950
They do make mistakes.
Uh,
you know,
this woman better than I do.

1265
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:40.450
If you feel like it's worth it,
give her another chance.

1266
01:14:40.451 --> 01:14:44.500
But I would sit on this thing for about at least six weeks.

1267
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.391
Uh,

1268
01:14:47.391 --> 01:14:51.920
I wouldn't have contact with her and I would just try to get yourself back into

1269
01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:54.440
you and not the US mode.

1270
01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:58.280
And after six weeks or something,

1271
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:00.243
<v 2>I dunno.</v>

1272
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.810
<v 0>I think you really got to like,
uh,</v>

1273
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:08.250
you gotta you gotta you gotta this isn't one of those.
Wow.
All right.
You know,

1274
01:15:08.251 --> 01:15:09.350
all right.
Shake it off.

1275
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:11.743
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1276
01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:17.000
<v 0>That's what I would do.
Okay.
And like say,
what the fuck do I know?
Uh,</v>

1277
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:21.970
and I'm sorry that that happened to you,
man.
That's fucking brutal.
Um,
you know,

1278
01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.940
I've been there and I've made both decisions.

1279
01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:30.630
I've stayed in it and then got burned again and I have walked and then thought,

1280
01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:32.254
what if,

1281
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:38.230
so a lot of suctioning around the holidays to have Jesus Christ.
Anyway,

1282
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:43.240
just plow ahead.
A girlfriend wants me to quit.
God,
quit job.
Dear Bill,

1283
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.030
I'm going to very strange yet fortuitous situation.

1284
01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:49.870
My girlfriend and likely soon fiance inherited a large sum of money.

1285
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:54.200
She has asked me to quit my job and travel with her for a year.

1286
01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.710
I'm pretty sure in my girlfriend inherited a large summit.

1287
01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.360
She's asked me to quit my job and traveled for a year.
No,
no,
fuck no,

1288
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.333
<v 2>no,</v>

1289
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:14.220
<v 0>no,
no.
Well,
yeah,
your fucking mind.
Wait a minute.
What kind of job do you have?</v>

1290
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.400
Right.
Let me finish this.
This is amazing.
Of course.
However,

1291
01:16:17.401 --> 01:16:19.200
I don't want to leave my job permanently.

1292
01:16:19.201 --> 01:16:23.340
I have a great job in his set in sound engineering and I'm not sure it would be

1293
01:16:23.341 --> 01:16:28.140
available to me after a year long absence.
Yeah,
it seems like a no brainer,

1294
01:16:28.141 --> 01:16:32.730
but I'm definitely apprehensive.
Can you help me weigh the pros and cons?
Thanks.

1295
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:33.500
Yeah.

1296
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:38.500
You're going to fucking throw your God damn career away for one fucking year on

1297
01:16:38.871 --> 01:16:39.651
the God damn dude.

1298
01:16:39.651 --> 01:16:43.070
You're going to spend a fucking year on the road with the same person.

1299
01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:44.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1300
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.330
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1301
01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:47.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1302
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.550
<v 0>Johnny Appleseed did it Solo.
Marco Polo did it solo.
I'm telling you.</v>

1303
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:52.690
Take a fucking hint.

1304
01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:55.873
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1305
01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:58.850
<v 0>Do bands travel like that for a fucking year?</v>

1306
01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.720
They traveled the world for a fucking year,
living their dream,

1307
01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.160
not quitting their jobs and most bands don't make it through and then not even

1308
01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:11.060
involved in an intimate like,
you know,
couple thing.

1309
01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:14.310
It's a business relationship and they don't even make it,

1310
01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:17.400
I think to save your fucking relationship.
You don't go,

1311
01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:21.660
you're going to be fucking sick of each other and you're going to have no

1312
01:17:21.661 --> 01:17:26.370
fucking job to go back to.
This could be the end of your relationship.
Just say,

1313
01:17:26.371 --> 01:17:28.950
listen,
I would love to go to it,
but like,
I mean,
don't say this,

1314
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:33.090
that other shit I just said,
but dude,
just do a Connie.
Not for nothing.

1315
01:17:33.091 --> 01:17:38.010
I don't work at a fucking,
you know,
a juice bar.
I'm an engineer,

1316
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.710
okay?
I'm designing bridges and Shit.
All right,

1317
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.380
I got a job here that is going to,

1318
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:49.460
that's going to make us financially secure for the rest of our fucking lives.

1319
01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:53.580
And I know that you just inherited a large sum of money,
but Jesus Christ,
we're,

1320
01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.040
where can we put that?
We're going to put that legitimately,
safely,

1321
01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:01.490
that we are 100% guaranteed.

1322
01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:02.750
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1323
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:06.140
<v 0>To not lose it in the future.
I know in my country,
stick it in the stock market.</v>

1324
01:18:06.141 --> 01:18:09.200
You might as well put it on a crap table.
I know you stick it in a bank.

1325
01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:12.020
They're going to give you a half percent interest in for all you know,

1326
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.160
that bank goes under,

1327
01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:16.130
it gets bought out by a bigger bank and everybody's too big to fail.

1328
01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.400
And you're in that fucking line standing there next to a farmer with you.

1329
01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:24.260
Little fucking,
you know you a little book like Johnny Depp in,
uh,

1330
01:18:24.261 --> 01:18:29.261
that fucking drug movie that he made the fuck was it called Jesus Christ.

1331
01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:33.530
I saw it twice and it gives those people all that,
all that money.

1332
01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:37.760
And then they gave him a little fucking book and he goes,
I gave him a,
you know,

1333
01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:39.680
he goes,
I gave him fucking whatever,

1334
01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:43.400
10 million in cash and they gave me a book with a number on it.

1335
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:47.180
And what's hilarious is that cash represents gold that you can't claim anymore.

1336
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:49.180
So you just basically gave them a bunch of piece of pit.

1337
01:18:49.181 --> 01:18:50.420
I'll fucking thing is a lie.

1338
01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:54.500
The only thing that you can count on is money still coming in.
All right.

1339
01:18:54.501 --> 01:18:57.320
And that's what you get with your engineering job.
So I would not quit it.

1340
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:59.060
I would not.
I would say,

1341
01:18:59.061 --> 01:19:03.710
let's see if you want to take a couple of long vacations.
Absolutely.
But uh,

1342
01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.410
you know,
this is my career.

1343
01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.060
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1344
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:11.510
<v 0>And you know,
if she gives you shit,
it would just be like,
listen sweetheart,</v>

1345
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:16.220
if I,
if I had,
if I didn't have a career,
if I had nothing going on,

1346
01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.240
I would do this in a second.
I would love to see the world with you.

1347
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:25.280
I would love to spend 365 fucking days with you in a row.
Oh my God.

1348
01:19:25.281 --> 01:19:29.610
Doesn't that sound like fun?
Um,
to,

1349
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:34.690
nobody is meant to spend that much at that amount of time with one another.

1350
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:36.720
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.520
<v 0>There,
there just is.
Nobody is</v>

1352
01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:39.750
<v 3>okay.</v>

1353
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:40.560
<v 0>There's not a,</v>

1354
01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.330
there's nobody I fuckin know other than myself that I could spend that amount of

1355
01:19:45.331 --> 01:19:47.770
time with 365 days.

1356
01:19:47.771 --> 01:19:50.460
And really the only reason why I could do with myself is I don't have the option

1357
01:19:50.461 --> 01:19:53.220
of leaving myself less.
I try and meditate.

1358
01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:54.900
You don't float across the fucking room.

1359
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:58.770
You don't get that wonderful feeling of leaving your body and then you start

1360
01:19:58.771 --> 01:20:00.570
thinking,
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it,
I'm throwing it.

1361
01:20:00.571 --> 01:20:03.870
And then that ruins the meditative thing and then you have sucked right back

1362
01:20:03.871 --> 01:20:08.700
into yourself.
All right.
All,
all right.
You know what does a podcast,

1363
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:12.090
