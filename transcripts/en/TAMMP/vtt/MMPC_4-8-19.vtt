coming up on next week.
This Saturday.

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.830
Everybody thinks the big story this week.
The big fucking story.

13
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.330
What are they talking about?
Oh,
oh,
the fucking NCAA finals game.

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.680
Oh,
baseball's done.
The way all the NHL playoffs are starting,

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.700
that'd be A's right around.
Everybody thinks those are the big story.

16
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:57.430
I would Trump fired somebody else.
Oh,

17
00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.080

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.700
<v 0>Somebody fucking stepped on somebody's toe and Canada and didn't apologize.</v>

20
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.340
<v 0>Now they've been canceled.
Canadian Twitter.</v>

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.110
Everybody thinks those are the big stories.
Those are not all right.

23
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.540
I,
I'm ashamed of volume.

24
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:22.340
If you think that these stories are bigger than the fact that all freckles has

25
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:27.020
gone 19 weeks without drinking and coming up this weekend,
that's 20 weeks.

26
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.040
Two zero baby.
I'm almost halfway fucking there.

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.540
Just like that.

28
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.750
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.490
<v 0>the man shut it down.
So there you go.</v>

30
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.950
While you a motherfuckers out there trying to say,

31
00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:46.120
I was one of you that I needed this whole gang of people that help me fucking

32
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:50.020
walk out of a bar like Kellen Winslow after that fucking Miami Dolphin game.

33
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:51.880
I don't need you fucking people.

34
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.470
I get control when I decide.

35
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.840
When I say it's over,
it's fucking over.

36
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:04.670
And they sang about booze.
All right.

37
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.370
<v 0>A Bose has no respect for fucking alcoholics.
He sees you.
He sees you weak.</v>

39
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.330
It's like when Tyson would win it,
the whole fight and the fucking stare down.

40
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:18.930
That's the best.
That bottle of booze staring at you.
Fucking gay people now me.

41
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.730
<v 0>I'm a tougher breed of an alcoholic and what's known as a binge drinker.</v>

43
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.970
It's the switch man.
Flip it on a flip it off.
Okay.
And I'm the,

44
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.240
I'm the man touching the socket.
I ain't know what I'm saying.
I'm just psyched.

45
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.920
I'm like halfway through.
I'm not trying to make funny you fucking a people.

46
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.420
I feel bad for a people,
you know.
Everybody gave a shit what they,

47
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.820
what they had to say and about all of their stories.

48
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:54.080
Pre nine 11 and then after nine 11 it all went to hell.
Right?

49
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:58.850
Then it was all about supporting the troops.
You know,
the first responders.

50
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.580
Now it's all the way down to like fucking mailmen and mail lady say they're all

51
00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:03.414
in front of Ya.

52
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.600
Everybody forgot I brought our fallen heroes,

53
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.960
the raging alcoholics and all of their goddamn stairs.
Man.

54
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.420
Ben,
I remember that pre fuck.
What the fuck?
I can't even talk anymore.

55
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.060
Pre nine 11 how many fucking movies did they make about alcoholics?

56
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.350
<v 1>Okay,</v>

57
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.150
<v 0>Eh,
Ali's fucking movies.
All right.
I can't think of any right now.</v>

58
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.530
Barfly yeah.

59
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.210
<v 0>Leaving Las Vegas.
Oops,
I did it again,</v>

61
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.790
right?
Was that the soundtrack?
Britney spears ward a soundtrack to a drunk booby.

62
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.210
I figured out what the fuck it was.
Right?

63
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:50.211
But that was all these fucking movies about these alcoholics and how they gay

64
00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:54.540
code and do this and they couldn't do that.
And they get all fucking,
you know,

65
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:57.660
and they're there.
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
People.

66
00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:00.320
I'm just trying to fill up an hour while annoying a circuit,

67
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.600
certain segment of the population decided today I decided it was going to be

68
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:08.100
alcoholics.
Come on.
We've all lived with one.
Ah,

69
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.480
they're fucking excuses.
Always blaming the bottle.

70
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.550
It's like 20% wasn't you?

71
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.790
The silver and I'm staring at right now.
20% of that fucking shit wasn't you.

72
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.620
It's all in the bottle.
Like a little Janie.
You just put it right bay.

73
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.920
But Babe Adelabu fucking Bourbon.

74
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.050
Is it print Sally?
Fabulous.
He,
oh,
that movie's like offensive,

75
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:37.980
I think to the Middle Eastern people.
You know what I mean?

76
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.040
It's a weird one,
right?
Hollywood thinks that we're,
we're,

77
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:48.870
we're magical and fly on carpets.
All right,
well I can see.
Well,
you know,

78
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.460
that's not really trading like a human big,
but,
uh,

79
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:53.670
it's a lot better than they treat a lot of people in Hollywood.

80
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.790
Some other groups and trade a little bit worse.
Uh,

81
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.800
anyways,
I don't know.
Why do I comment on things?

82
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.550
I don't,
I,
you know,
I just see shit and I immediately think,
hey,

83
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:15.240
I have an opinion.
I haven't read up on anything.
God Damn,
I'm,

84
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.680
I'm having a great time right now because we are uh,
we are on episode nine,

85
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.360
number nine of season four,
episode family.

86
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.600
And uh,
I can't tell you what's happening,

87
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:33.601
but some people end up in this city that I had to do some research on.

88
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.410
I found out all this cool shit about it.
You know,
you know,
you don't me.

89
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.080
All right?
You don't know me.
You think you know me and I think I know me,

90
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:44.770
but nobody knows what the fuck's going on with me.
All right?

91
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:49.630
But I like,
you know,
this might surprise a lot of you guys.

92
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.100
I am not a fan.
I can't say I'm not a fan,

93
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:56.470
but I don't give a fuck about a level cities.

94
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

95
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 0>Right.</v>

96
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 1>Any city that you two tours too.
I don't give a shit about it.
All right.</v>

97
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:06.590
At that point is blown out this cheesecake factories and fucking Dick Sporting

98
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.430
goods all over the fucking place.
It's all been devoured,

99
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.620
paved over those giant store windows that look like tropical fish tanks.

100
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.790
Now you know those things.

101
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.930
<v 0>I like going to those fucking ones that you know,</v>

102
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.410
the people that are in to you to have to drive from.

103
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.870
Why doesn't John Cougar Mellencamp error come to my city?

104
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.730
Um,
is there a reason why that guy always acts like he's a farmer?

105
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.460
Wasn't even like the glee club or something.

106
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:44.370
He's always acting like he's in the fucking west side story or some shit.

107
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.720
Ryan owners scare crow blown to plow.
Yeah,

108
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:50.400
you fucking play the Ukulele.

109
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.220
Stepped back like you were out there at fucking picking Avocados.

110
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:54.810
Whatever the fuck is.
You pretend that you did

111
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.550
say it at your job or horse should all make a rat.

112
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.340
He was the voice of the farmers long before all of these fucking stupid comic

113
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:11.970
started becoming the voice of fucking different causes.

114
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.110
You had this stupid musicians,
musicians doing it right.

115
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.520
What I love is no matter how much somebody,

116
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:22.350
when they're going to loan their celebrity,

117
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.070
what are you doing for this cause?
Famous person.
Well,

118
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:29.880
I am loaning by celebrity rehab.

119
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.980
Not going to use it for me in this moment and this moment I'm going to loan it

120
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:39.230
out to the common people.

121
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.770
The people have come to my movies and people ask for autographs,

122
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.290
<v 1>okay?</v>

123
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.940
<v 0>The people that I walk past,</v>

124
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.310
<v 1>okay.</v>

125
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.640
<v 0>At airports,
uh,
my way to buy a private jet,</v>

126
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.060
I am loaning my celebrity.
Whenever somebody loans they're slip,

127
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:56.220
it still ends up just just being about the celebrity,
isn't it?

128
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.663
<v 1>You know,</v>

129
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.160
<v 0>glows.
Those fucking comedy horror.
You see it,
those fucking things,
right?</v>

130
00:08:04.161 --> 00:08:05.690
They're always up on the stage

131
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.350
then ever out in the crowd with the real fucking people.

132
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:12.350
Are they rubbing elbows with America?

133
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:13.660
<v 1>Okay?</v>

134
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.780
<v 0>You don't look into the eyes staring at that fucking</v>

135
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.260
<v 1>yeah.</v>

136
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.170
<v 0>Post fucking,
what do you call Invisalign?
Dentition.</v>

137
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.340
You don't even know what you're talking about anymore.
You know,
it's,

138
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.260
it's fucking point.
You don't even,

139
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:27.450
you don't even know what the fuck you looking at.

140
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.040
God bless people who are dating right now with Invisalign,

141
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.460

You don't know.
You could be married off fucking troll.

142
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.020
You don't even know.
You don't even realize it,

143
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.713
<v 1>Huh?</v>

144
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.780
<v 0>There should be something you shouldn't be allowed to fix yourself until after</v>

145
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:48.190
you find love and you know what you're doing both people a favor.

146
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.900
So then you know it's real.

147
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.330
All these people in these fucking commercials late at night,
right?

148
00:08:54.331 --> 00:08:57.500
I'm laying in bald son of a bitch,
top of my head,

149
00:08:57.501 --> 00:08:59.720
ice cold against that fucking pillow,
right?

150
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.240
And I'm watching the TV at every five fucking seconds.

151
00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:09.620
They got some fucking con coming out of a pool,
right?

152
00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:13.990
With his fucking hair.
I'll wave it around.
He's playing fucking bad mitten.

153
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.270
<v 1>Okay?</v>

154
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.360
<v 0>Live in this active lifestyle.
And everybody's always like,
well,
Gee,</v>

155
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:22.020
I can't fuck a one.
I can't go for a swim unless I have hair plugs.

156
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.130
I can't play Badmouth.
That's not what it's about.
It's not about being active,

157
00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:31.830
but showing that you can be active and you're not wearing a wig and it's not

158
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:33.300
going to come flying off.

159
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.370
<v 1>Okay?</v>

160
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.180
<v 0>That's what used to happen back in the day,
people would get a wig.</v>

161
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

162
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:40.801
<v 0>You know,</v>

163
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.860
you decided you were getting a wig and then what you had to do was you had to

164
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:47.280
leave town,
okay.
And show up wearing your wig

165
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.250
and hope that they all bought it and all of a sudden you had a little more

166
00:09:52.251 --> 00:09:52.881
confidence.

167
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:56.120
You talking to these beautiful check and everything's going fucking great,
right?

168
00:09:56.121 --> 00:09:57.500
You're nervous on the first date.

169
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.740
You feel yourself sweating underneath your fucking toupee,

170
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.160
literally trickling down the back of your skull,

171
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.490
going into the back of your shirt and all you're thinking is,

172
00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:08.270
thank God I wore a fucking sport coat.

173
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.643
<v 1>All right,</v>

174
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.700
<v 0>cause I am sweating my fucking pits off right now,</v>

175
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.563
you know?

176
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.203
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.730
<v 0>And you fold them for a while then one day.
You know what I mean?</v>

178
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.630
You get a little boozed up,
you get a little sloppy,
you know,

179
00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:28.690
put the fucking tape on,
right.
Whatever you do.
I don't know how it sticks there.

180
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.930
I don't know if it's a little fucking,
I should look at that up.

181
00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:34.180
I should look that up one day.
How to fucking put away God,

182
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.200
how to glue it to the top of your head,
but then,
then,
then,
then all of a sudden,

183
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:39.880
all the advertising I'm going to be getting,

184
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.680
it's going to be like filos paint rollers with wig glue and that.

185
00:10:44.681 --> 00:10:46.510
Now get your second roller for free

186
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.030
just in case she got some alopecia down there and your pube area,
we can get you,

187
00:10:52.031 --> 00:10:55.120
we can give you a fucking pube wig.
A two for one,

188
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.620
two for one fucking wig down there by your pubes and up there on top of your

189
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:04.390
head.
We'll even throw in some eyebrows for you.
Um,

190
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.120
yeah,
you went to a new fucking town and then one day something happened.

191
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:10.510
You had to get involved in something,

192
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.400
some fucking four alarm fire and all they got is one fire house.
Next.

193
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.850
They know you're in the bucket brigade,
you start sweating.

194
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

195
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.660
<v 0>Maybe one of the amber,
Zara embers,
whatever you say,</v>

196
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.410
fucking flies away from the fire and lands on top of that to pay.

197
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:28.030
And then it's like,
oh my God.

198
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

199
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.520
<v 0>I thought watching those people screaming from that burning building was the</v>

200
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:35.940
most incredible thing I was going to see tonight until I saw your fucking wig

201
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.030
catch on fire.
Pull it off your fucking head.

202
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.840
And you went from 26 to 48 right in front of my eyes.

203
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.830
Who is his outlet outside or Honda's carpet bagger.

204
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.900
Do you guys were a big deal?
It was back in the day when a stranger moved to

205
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.210
cause you know there was no way to vet anybody.

206
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:00.250
He didn't know what the fuck was coming to town.

207
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.410
<v 0>You know,
is this a serial killer?
Is this person wanted,
is this a war criminal?</v>

209
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.190
Did this person escaped from jail?
Did they just robbed a bank?

210
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

211
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.590
<v 0>Are they a scientologist?
Are they a a Mormon?</v>

212
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

213
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.670
<v 0>Are they a Jehovah's witness?</v>

214
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.860
Who is this guy and what the fuck's going on with this?

215
00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:27.680
This something not right about them.
I can't figure out what the fuck it is.

216
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.920
And then we're all gossiping about you.
Assists smile on your face.

217
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.590
What is your buddy killed somebody I know something about something about him.

218
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.380
Something in his eyes
seem like there's something in his eyes.

219
00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:40.650
I don't know what the fuck's wrong with them.

220
00:12:40.651 --> 00:12:42.410
Is something going on with that fucking guy?

221
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:43.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.000
<v 0>Then everybody starts talking and shit.
Nick.
See No,</v>

223
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.900
people are drinking who we are.
Get fucking random.

224
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.470
I lock this town before it came.
When you get you walk down this tree,

225
00:12:54.471 --> 00:12:58.340
not worry about some motherfucker was somewhere.
Look on his face.

226
00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.280
We are a string them up.
Right.

227
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.220
And then they fucking go down and they grabbed the mother fucker or they write

228
00:13:04.221 --> 00:13:07.010
as they put the rope around his head and he's screaming and yelling and he's

229
00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:11.870
like,
alright,
I've got a wig.
I got her fucking wagon.
That was it.

230
00:13:11.871 --> 00:13:13.380
And they took it off and all the towns,

231
00:13:13.381 --> 00:13:17.450
people laughed at him and they tarred and feathered the top of his head.

232
00:13:17.451 --> 00:13:20.750
The tide is fucking arms behind his back and they slapped that horse in the ass

233
00:13:20.751 --> 00:13:23.870
and he was on the way to the next fucking town.
And that's the way it was.

234
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.620
That's the way America was back in the day,
you know.
And you know,

235
00:13:27.621 --> 00:13:31.040
it's difficult as that is,
it is a part of our history.

236
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.670
It is kind of funny that people used to live a life like that.

237
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:36.710
<v 1>Okay?</v>

238
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.590
<v 0>And you listened to what people complain about today and it all pales in</v>

239
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:40.424
comparison,

240
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:42.130
<v 1>okay?</v>

241
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.671
<v 0>To Ryan,</v>

242
00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:47.120
out of town on a horse she can't fucking control with the top of your skull,

243
00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:50.120
tarred and feathered.
Alright,
this has been another episode.

244
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:51.700
<v 1>Okay,</v>

245
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.960
<v 0>what are those fucking history,</v>

246
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:55.930
those fuck ever listen to one of those fucking history podcast,

247
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.800
they tried to say that there was an entire field of skulls and bones still

248
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:00.820
existing in Russia.

249
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.340
He usually go there and it's really intense fucking talking and all.

250
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:07.510
It took me like two fucking Google searches to be like,
yeah,

251
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:08.620
that field doesn't exist.

252
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.910
Even if that wasn't true,
I want the guy was so fucking intense.

253
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.470
It just annoyed me.
It's like,

254
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:23.620
why are you taking on the intensity of this battle as though you fought it?

255
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.020
You didn't fight this fucking thing.
All right,

256
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.580
so why don't you bring your voice up a couple of fucking octaves still way you

257
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.940
normally talk and these people,
they came in Yangon.
Hey Gay fucking shit.

258
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.470
Like Tianya VFE this man beat this guy to death with a femur.

259
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.460
Um,
if you're going to beat somebody death with,

260
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:46.120
with a human bone,
you'd think he'd want the femur.
Yeah,

261
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.410
I think he'd want the femur.
If you could,

262
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.210
if the guy was far enough away and you could get sort of extension.

263
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.360
All right.
Other than that,
I,

264
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.290
you gotta go humorous.
Okay.
It's the second biggest bone.

265
00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:04.810
It's an easier thing to swing.
It's better.
You know,

266
00:15:04.811 --> 00:15:07.390
you can kind of also jab somebody in the face with it.

267
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.080
Famers a little too big for my tastes.
You know,
ladies,

268
00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:14.610
you might go with the radius and Ulna.
You don't come in a little nunchuck thing.

269
00:15:14.611 --> 00:15:16.300
You can put some chains between the two of them.

270
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.390
This is all things we're going to have to deal with in about,

271
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.410
I guess 30 years with global warming.
Um,

272
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.680
there's the world goes to hell in a fucking hand basket.

273
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.800
You know what's great about if you don't watch the news,

274
00:15:29.801 --> 00:15:31.090
you think everything's fine.

275
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.640
<v 1>Okay?</v>

276
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.540
<v 0>It's a great experiment because I spent a lot of time paying attention to the</v>

277
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:40.530
news periods of my life and all I did was get freaked out and nothing changed

278
00:15:40.531 --> 00:15:43.980
and nothing got better.
But if you don't pay attention

279
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.700
and he just sit there and you just,
I dunno.

280
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.120
<v 1>Okay,</v>

281
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.590
<v 0>watch sports.
You can't even watch sports cause they drag it into that shit.
Now,</v>

282
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:59.240
every fucking five seconds somebody's dying or something and they're bringing a

283
00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:03.050
troop out of fucking firefighters.
You know,
I don't know.
Something.

284
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.650
There's always something.
Hey,
what do you enjoy in the game?

285
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.240
Will let us remind you how lucky you are.
We know how lucky we are.

286
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.810
How many fucking times,
Ladies and gentlemen,

287
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.840
a direct your attention to section two oh three some guy who got attacked by a

288
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:25.780
fucking pack,
a wild fucking toads,
Assam Shit.

289
00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:29.620
Now I got to sit there and look at this fucking guy with his work comp coverage

290
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:30.454
face.

291
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.220
It's one of them stories makes you hold your kid a little,
little closer,

292
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.570
hug them a little tighter.
Um,

293
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.923
<v 1>okay.</v>

294
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.280
<v 0>Anyways,
I'm going to fly a cello copter tomorrow.
Can't wait,</v>

295
00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:47.040
haven't done that in a minute.
And uh,

296
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.380
they'll do that early in the morning and then I'm going to go in and I'm gonna

297
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.350
start working on this fucking script.
That's what I'm going to do.
Bill,

298
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.210
how's the pull ups coming?
We know you've been,

299
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.960
your shoulders have been slowly disintegrating and you've been trying to build

300
00:17:00.961 --> 00:17:05.430
them up.
Um,
I actually lat pull downs,
I'm up to 120 pounds,

301
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.830
you know,
which is huge.

302
00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:12.240
Coming back from rotator cuff fucking injury when you're in your 50.

303
00:17:12.241 --> 00:17:16.110
So all I need to do is be able to do like three sets of 15,

304
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.770
and then I ought to be able to try one or two pull ups with my own body weight.

305
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.430
That's what I've been told.
All right,
so

306
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.100
I got a ways to go but a little bit of daylight there cause I got that bet with

307
00:17:29.101 --> 00:17:32.450
Versie
the pride of New Jersey.

308
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:33.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.020
<v 0>All right.
The Newark Native,</v>

310
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.060
the uh,
the Trenton Teetotaller,
um,

311
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.680
that I won't be able to do 10 pull ups when I'm 70.
Okay.

312
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.270
So He's,
he's out of his fucking mind cause I will do fucking,

313
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.540
I'll do that stem cell shit into my shoulders just to fuck win that bet.

314
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.550
And stem cells is basically,

315
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.140
it's a hair transplant for your fucking shoulders.
Right?
Isn't that how it works?

316
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.761
It's so funny.

317
00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:06.490
All these fucking people doing all this shit to try it live longer.

318
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.020
You know what I mean?
It's like I was trying to tell me,

319
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:11.050
he asked me the other day like,

320
00:18:11.051 --> 00:18:13.390
when do you think the perfect time to be born was?

321
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.720
And um,

322
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.660
I would say somewhere in the 1940s.

323
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.350
So you miss out on World War II,

324
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:31.120
you miss out on the Korean conflict and he got Vietnam.

325
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.510
Right.
But if he can somehow get out of that,

326
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.600
as far as,
you know,

327
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.690
you got to live in some great decades.

328
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:43.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

329
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.880
<v 0>You still got to enjoy the four seasons,
you know,
things get,</v>

330
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.880
didn't get too fucked up until like the late sixties.

331
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.400
Then I gotta I gotta be honest with you though,

332
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.910
being born in the 60s and being a kid in the 70s,

333
00:18:58.911 --> 00:19:01.560
a teenager in the 80s and in my twenties and my nineties,

334
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.690
that's a pretty good ride.

335
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.490
Maybe everybody thinks that because they young,
I dunno.

336
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.450
I'm just sick of these fucking people coming up to me who aren't scientists

337
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:16.920
telling me when the world is going end.
Um,
it's like I get it.
I get it.

338
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.660
I got it.
Shit is fucked up please.
For the love of God.
Um,
I have a kid.
All right.

339
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.990
I'm trying to block that out because that's all my God,

340
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:29.220
this podcast just took a dark fucking turn.
Oh,

341
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:30.640
maybe I could sing your song.

342
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.230
The Sun will come out tomorrow and it will be a little hotter than fuck and

343
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:38.520
yesterday

344
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.170
and then you're done.

345
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.430
Gr Liverpool keeps winning and sodas,
Man City.

346
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.180
This has been one of the most boring things I've ever watched in sports because

347
00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:53.030
knowing that these are the two best teams and they're never going to fucking

348
00:19:53.031 --> 00:19:55.130
play each other in some sort of series.

349
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.520
<v 0>To figure it out.
This is like,
Hey,
you know,</v>

351
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.140
I'm going to shadow box over here.

352
00:20:02.141 --> 00:20:05.170
Well I'm shadow boxing over here and somehow we're fighting each other.

353
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

354
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.900
<v 0>I Dunno,
I just don't fucking understand that game.</v>

355
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.320
Now I get the game.
Now I understand it more.
I just don't understand.

356
00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:17.780
Like that's how you decide who's the fucking champion.

357
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:20.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

358
00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.461
<v 0>Everything else.</v>

359
00:20:21.461 --> 00:20:24.640
Just the top two fucking people at least go out and kick the shit out of each

360
00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:28.030
other and the web is left standing.
Wins.
Not In soccer.

361
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

362
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.840
<v 0>Not In soccer when fucking trip and somebody makes them roll around that you</v>

363
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:37.790
think you literally think they're on fire.
Um,
but anyways,

364
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:41.590
I'm still rooting for Liverpool.
I'm basically rooting from man,

365
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.610
not for Liverpool,
the beat Man City.

366
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.700
Cause they're not going to play each other now anymore.

367
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:50.450
I'm just rooting for Man City.
Not Win against an opponent that isn't Liverpool.

368
00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:54.920
While Liverpool wins an opponent that isn't man city.
Oh,
that's exciting.

369
00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:59.600
I can see why the world is into this game.
Then I get me some hate mail.

370
00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.720
All right.
Oh look who's here.
I'll,

371
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.310
<v 2>oh,</v>

372
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.240
<v 0>all set.
But crewed up.</v>

373
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:13.370
Hiring used to be hard and it was so much harder for a woman.

374
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.410
Multiple job sites.
Forget about transitioning people.

375
00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.060
They had the hardest time hiring people,
multiple job sites,

stacks of resumes,
a confusing review process.

435
00:25:18.201 --> 00:25:20.390
but he'll sit in that fucking traffic to go to the beach.
Won't yet.

436
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.900

I bought those Bruins.
You liked that play in Tampa.
Again,

465
00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.580
we're playing Tampa Bay so smart.
This is what we do in the first,

466
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.960
the beginning of the game would come out.

467
00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:26.200
We show them what we can do and then once they start thinking of,
fuck,

468
00:27:26.201 --> 00:27:29.770
I don't want to meet these guys in playoffs.
We just fucking chill.

469
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:33.250
We just chill and let them score like four or five,
six fucking goals.

470
00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.970
And now we got Tampa right where we want them.
Okay?

471
00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.900
They one more goddamn games and scored more fucking points than anybody since

472
00:27:40.901 --> 00:27:44.050
1995 when these fucking Goddamn,
you know,

473
00:27:44.051 --> 00:27:47.920
blue and white cuts from the sunshine state really think that they're going to

474
00:27:47.921 --> 00:27:49.720
fucking skate their way to the Stanley Cup.

475
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.890
I got news for you after we get done playing patty cake with the fucking Toronto

476
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.970
Maple leafs.
God Damn fucking asses.
All right,
we're going to be there,

477
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.150
right?
I would next round maybe two rounds.
Yeah,
but they ever fucking record.

478
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.003
All right.

479
00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

480
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.070
<v 0>Right.</v>

481
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.440
And then we're going to beat somebody else and then we're going to be there.

482
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.640
All right.
And we're going to do the exact same fucking thing,
you know,

483
00:28:12.641 --> 00:28:14.260
and we'll lose four games straight to you.

484
00:28:14.261 --> 00:28:17.500
And then your heads will not be barely be able to get your fucking helmets on

485
00:28:17.501 --> 00:28:18.760
and then you're going to get the old right there.

486
00:28:18.761 --> 00:28:23.761
Fred from my peck in the West having watched no hockey this year,

487
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.560
I'm going to pick the Nashville predators.

488
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.940
They got kind of close to the last few years.

489
00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.400
Everyone's writing them off this year.
Hey,

490
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.030
why not them about the San Jose sharks.
How about for once?

491
00:28:37.031 --> 00:28:40.810
How about for once they fucking pushed through the San Jose Sharks?

492
00:28:40.811 --> 00:28:42.940
Don't win the fucking Stanley Cup this fucking year.

493
00:28:42.941 --> 00:28:44.230
I know Carlos has got to get healthy.

494
00:28:44.231 --> 00:28:47.860
Why don't they just fucking turn the names to the fucking dolphins?

495
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.330
You know the poor purposes be timely.
Score a goal.

496
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:54.930
You make that little fucking noise.

497
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.870
You know they should change the logo to a dolphin and then they and the dolphin

498
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:04.380
with its little flippers retape that stick back together that the fucking,

499
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.450
the shark bit naff.
I think that that's half the problem.

500
00:29:08.451 --> 00:29:11.600
It's their fucking logo is the referee see it and then they just start calling

501
00:29:11.601 --> 00:29:13.550
slashing cause they see a stick been broken.

502
00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:17.090
And obviously that's must have been what happened,
right?

503
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:22.870
Brooklyn Nets made the playoffs in the Houston Rockets scored a 27 hit 27 three

504
00:29:23.691 --> 00:29:27.120
pointers tonight.
Um,

505
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.660
none of these teams could fucking beat the fucking 83 Milwaukee Bucks.

506
00:29:32.661 --> 00:29:37.520
But you know,
but it's a different game.
Dodgers,
a score and a bunch of runs.

507
00:29:37.521 --> 00:29:40.370
There's a lot of stuff happening.
I missed all of it.

508
00:29:40.371 --> 00:29:43.580
I had family town family down for bad Logan.

509
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.293
<v 1>MMM.</v>

510
00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.560
<v 0>All right.
Where do we go from here?
No booze in 19 weeks.</v>

511
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.810
You know what a fucking break up that was.

512
00:29:53.811 --> 00:29:56.090
Thank God I'm not a fucking week alcoholic.

513
00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

514
00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.640
<v 0>They're fucking fine.
40 people listen to my stupid fucking stories.</v>

515
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.220
Like those people that have been sober for like 30 fucking 40 years.

516
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

517
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.891
<v 0>Oh,
boring.</v>

518
00:30:07.891 --> 00:30:12.480
And their stories at that point is sitting there till in drunk stories from

519
00:30:12.481 --> 00:30:13.710
fucking back in the day.

520
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:15.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

521
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.730
<v 0>Oh,
I remember there was origin Howard here,</v>

522
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.070
judge or lectured.

523
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.830
I don't know where it's coming back from a sock hop.

524
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
I'm buying gold and I went to the whites only found and I took out a flash.

525
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.450
All right.
Buying gold?
A dear Billy throwback.

526
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:36.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

527
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.710
<v 0>Was listening to an old podcast where you said you were going to buy gold</v>

528
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.660
because the economy was unstable.
Oh yeah.
It was a little unstable.
Yes.

529
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.100
10 years ago.
Yeah.
I would say it was a little unstable.

530
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:51.500
I'd say I had my finger on the pulse a year after the big fucking crash,
uh,

531
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.430
two years at that point.
Um,

532
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.620
did you ever buy gold to stash away in case our currency crashed?

533
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.230
Why would I say that on the podcast?
Uh,

534
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.350
I think some people are treating bitcoin in the same way.
Thanks.

535
00:31:04.351 --> 00:31:06.060
And Go fuck yourself.
Ah,
yeah.

536
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:10.050
I thought about doing that and then until I found out how fucking difficult it

537
00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:12.540
is to buy gold coins.

538
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

539
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.910
<v 0>It's very hard to get your hands on some gold.
And then what?</v>

540
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.150
And then I just realized,
you know,
if I have a fucking gold coin,

541
00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:22.710
what am I going to do with it?

542
00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.030
So say the dollar crashes and nobody has any money,

543
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:31.350
then I'm walking down the street with a bag of gold coins.
Nobody has any money,

544
00:31:31.351 --> 00:31:32.490
they can't pay anybody.

545
00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:35.220
And that is a guy from the sandwich store going to fucking show up,

546
00:31:35.221 --> 00:31:36.390
also known as a deli.

547
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.560
Is he gonna show up at the Deli and I'm going to come walking in as he's not

548
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:44.220
getting paid and then I have a gold coin and going to get me fucking changed for

549
00:31:44.221 --> 00:31:49.080
that.
Does that,
he told me we'll get some silver coins and are worth as much.

550
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.220
Yeah.
I don't,
I,
you know something,
I don't need that fucking headache.

551
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.113
<v 1>MMM.</v>

552
00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.540
<v 0>You got gold coins,</v>

553
00:31:58.541 --> 00:32:01.960
which you want to do is trade that in for some fucking cyanide pills.
Okay.

554
00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:05.620
And then when everything goes to shit and people are coming up your driveway

555
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:10.360
that,
you know,
like your written that fucking movie us,
Eh,

556
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.470
you just fucking,
you take your,
uh,
you kill me pills.

557
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.330
I think that's the way they do it.
You know,

558
00:32:19.331 --> 00:32:23.640
get a flat screen TV and on all four walls of every fucking room you have,

559
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.030
just blow out the fucking ozone layer as much as you can.

560
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:28.740
And when the shit goes to hell,
you know,

561
00:32:28.741 --> 00:32:31.920
just watch it on all your TVs and you know,

562
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:35.850
when you recognize the helicopters surveillance footage and you're like,
oh fuck,

563
00:32:35.851 --> 00:32:37.560
that's my house.
So they right outside,

564
00:32:37.561 --> 00:32:41.720
then you take your pills or you get a panic from,

565
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.640
<v 1>okay,</v>

566
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.990
<v 0>you build a panic room.
Yeah.
But they could still smoky out.</v>

567
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.210
I would think.
There's always a way in.

568
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.780
I think what you do,
I liked the underground shit.

569
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.690
I think that's the way to go when people take,
you know,

570
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:04.300
basically in all his shit things that they,
um,

571
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.720
unload from those fucking ships down at the wharf and then they stick them on

572
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:11.420
the back of a truck,
18 wheeler chassis,
you know,

573
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:16.250
those things up from the second season of the wire and they find all those

574
00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:20.330
fucking poor people in there.
Right.
Spoiler alert,

575
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.070
the second season of the wire from fucking 15 years ago.
Um,

576
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.730
I liked the people,
they,
they get those things Barry.

577
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:29.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

<v 1>okay,</v>

580
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:32.911

581
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:36.740
is you got to dig the hole yourself because if you hire a contractor with a

582
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.300

<v 0>Oh Shit.</v>

589
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.470
Nah.

Let's say that's the way you dress,

590
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.190
the way you kill your wife.
You know,
cause they always say they never,

591
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.770
they never dig lower than like six feet.

592
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.933

596
00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:25.581

597
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:30.581
Or they just dump it in the woods just shoddy of all the fucking times to not

598

599
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.220
You know,

600
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.910
in a crime of passion,

601
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:48.290

That's what you do.

608
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.540
You go cool hand Luke times like fucking three.

609
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.423

611
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.170
Can you imagine digging a fucking hole for somebody that you know you're going

612
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:31.390
to kill you?
Not In the middle of digging that all gone.
Fuck am I doing?

613
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:38.500
Why don't I find it another fucking so why don't I just,
you know,
fight the guy.

614
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.360
Well I just let it go,
you know,

615
00:35:43.361 --> 00:35:46.480
go have a couple of fucking beers or something like that.

616
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.050
<v 1>Okay,</v>

617
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:53.050
<v 0>I'm going to kill this person and then risk going to jail for life and then</v>

618
00:35:53.181 --> 00:35:56.180
having to join.
Then at that point,
you know,
then what do you do?

619
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.100
You're a white dude.
You just killed somebody.

620
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.380
Now you gotta go through the pain in the ass,

621
00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:05.660
a fucking go into the prison library and Cram it on Adolf Hitler.

622
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.830
So you can come off as a legit Nazi and join the fucking Arie and brotherhood.

623
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.310
And then you've got to listen to the head dumb shit every fucking day for the

624
00:36:13.311 --> 00:36:14.480
rest of your life.
You know,

625
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.830
you'd think an AA meetings bad when you just a binge drinker.
Man,

626
00:36:18.831 --> 00:36:22.430
why do you fucking try that shit?
What just happened in my head?
Phones.

627
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.800
Everything was good.
Now I can't hear myself.
Hello?
Hello?

628
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.310
Is it still going?
What happened?
I literally just moved.

629
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.970
Oh God.
Don't don't do this to me.

630
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.800
Sam is such a fun time and then all of a sudden I can't hear myself.
Oh the,

631
00:36:39.801 --> 00:36:43.520
I see what happened.
I moved in.
The wire turned the volume down.

632
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.020
You guys were all panicking there.
Oh Christ.
This fucking guy with no producer.

633
00:36:48.021 --> 00:36:52.700
He's not going to be able to figure it out because my fucking laptop is losing

634
00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:53.534
its charge.

635
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.780
No fucking I can't move over here cause my headphone cord is too short.

636
00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.371
You know you wouldn't,

637
00:36:58.371 --> 00:37:01.360
you wouldn't think that I'm 10 years into this podcast listening to this and

638
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.590
these,

639
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:06.590
these fucking technology fucking problems be fucking person that I started out

640
00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:09.380
with the started doing a podcast.

641
00:37:09.381 --> 00:37:14.381
They fucking build some Howard stern level studio or some version of it.

642
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.233
You know what I mean?

643
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.180
I'm like the native American of fucking podcasting,
you know,

644
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.320
they just lived the same way.
Essentially.

645
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.830
Least that's what the history books say.
You know,
they just fucking,

646
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.570
this is how you kill a deer or this is how you use all of it.
All right?

647
00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.670
You want it these fucking,
you know,
it's fucking hilarious.

648
00:37:37.671 --> 00:37:42.320
All these fucking douchebag white people out there fucking with this stupid

649
00:37:42.321 --> 00:37:46.370
ideas about minimalism acting like they came up with that shit.

650
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:53.230
What the native Americans can the fuck this mother fucking God damn fucking sue

651
00:37:53.381 --> 00:37:57.770
the fuck came up with the,
now I don't do this anymore.
That's it right there.

652
00:37:57.771 --> 00:37:59.750
It goes to floor number four and then that's it.

653
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.830
Who the fuck came up with this stupid fucking magnet?

654
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:11.320
Fucking plug on the God Damn Apple Computer.

655
00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.480
Stupid fucking cons.

656
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:15.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

657
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.780
<v 0>Have you ever seen the apple building,
by the way?</v>

658
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.960
There's so many fucking companies.
They're just out of control then.
Fuck.

659
00:38:23.961 --> 00:38:27.640
It looks like the Pentagon.
No,
it doesn't build to circle.

660
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.010
The Pentagon is a 40

661
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.030
I just realize as far as shapes gold,
how dumb that sounded.

662
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

663
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:42.030
<v 0>I saw this round building.
You know what it looked like to me,
the Pentagon.
Hey,</v>

664
00:38:42.031 --> 00:38:46.680
who went to summer school for math almost every fucking year.
This guy,

665
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.510
this guy who's a fucking stupid fucked up

666
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.560
fucking assholes.
Stupid magnet.
You want me to fucking times.

667
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.300
I bet a replug that thing.

668
00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:02.301
And do you want me to stand as a person living in a first world country that

669
00:39:02.851 --> 00:39:05.130
that's the most difficult thing I have to deal with.

670
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.490
I can't imagine the sad person that makes us fucking plug.

671
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.083
<v 1>MMM.</v>

672
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.040
<v 0>How funny is it that they go after comedians for jokes and all these fucking</v>

673
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.983
yeah,

674
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.860
Goddamn company sampling like sweatshop labor and that's all fine.

675
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.360
That's all fine.
Well,
if we made the computer year,
they'd caught $90 million.

676
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.070
No they wouldn't.
They wouldn't.

677
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:32.770
If you actually paid people and you paid and gave them benefits and you took it

678
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:36.930
out of your end,
you don't anybody to say that?
Well,

679
00:39:36.931 --> 00:39:40.530
we could make shirts here,
but they cost $700 each.
It's like,

680
00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.010
how little are you paying people to sell these things together?

681
00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.810
Cause they're not going to take a pay cut because they going to stay on their

682
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:53.920
yacht with their mountain of cocaine and they're fucking horse.

683
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:55.710
<v 1>Okay.</v>

684
00:39:55.710 --> 00:40:00.570
<v 0>That's the biggest problem with the fucking world is horse will fuck anything if</v>

685
00:40:00.571 --> 00:40:01.410
it has money.

686
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:03.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

687
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:05.380
<v 0>Maybe of Horseheads standards.</v>

688
00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:08.710
All of these fucking guys wouldn't be fucking doing whatever I'm doing.

689
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:09.970
Whatever it takes,

690
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:15.590
doing whatever it takes to get a fine piece of fucking pussy that never did

691
00:40:15.591 --> 00:40:20.591
anything other than suck my dick sit next to me on my yard with my fucking name

692
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.050
stitched into the fucking seat.

693
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

694
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.840
<v 0>Oh,
is there anything better than when a yard sinks other than the crew?
Oh,</v>

695
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.280
it's just my favorite thing ever.
It just doesn't happen enough.

696
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.440
Just doesn't happen enough.
You know?

697
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.130
Can you imagine that you're sleeping in the bowels of that thing,

698
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.150
like the things you had to do to get that fucking yard and all of a sudden you

699
00:40:43.151 --> 00:40:47.500
start taking on water and the radio isn't working and for the first time in

700
00:40:47.501 --> 00:40:49.480
years you're thinking about a higher power.

701
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:54.990
And all the sins you have to fucking confess to how fast are you fucking

702
00:40:55.811 --> 00:41:00.030
yammering is you start to feel the water coming up around you fucking

703
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.520
sheepskin fucking slippers.
Whatever the fuck rich people have,

704
00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.810
everybody can have sheepskin bill sheepskins gets not expensive.
All right.

705
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.030
Probably some endangered species of baby seal.

706
00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:14.910
Fucking slippers would've been a better reference.

707
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.530
Whatever next podcast,
I'll get it.
Next podcast.
Um,
yeah,

708
00:41:19.531 --> 00:41:23.700
so I got into conspiracy theory and all of that type of shit,
but I got into the,

709
00:41:23.701 --> 00:41:26.880
I got into the scary part of a conspiracy theory.

710
00:41:26.881 --> 00:41:30.030
I was reading about shit that was actually happening and then people's theories

711
00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:32.740
about it.
I wasn't reading about,
you know,
shape shifters and,

712
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:36.540
and fucking the government actually has a flying saucer in,

713
00:41:36.541 --> 00:41:40.770
in the area of 51 or whatever the fuck it,
all.
That shit was just like,
Oh really?

714
00:41:40.771 --> 00:41:41.670
Okay,
whatever.

715
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.030
I got more into the economies and banking and Nah,

716
00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.520
uh,
you know,

717
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.790
corporate greed and uh,

718
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.950
<v 1>okay.</v>

719
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.010
<v 0>Politicians and our,</v>

720
00:41:56.011 --> 00:41:59.880
the whole fucking thing works and offshore accounts and just all of this crap.

721
00:41:59.881 --> 00:42:03.920
I get into that stuff.
I didn't get into late,
you know,
who were actually aliens,

722
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.870
uh,
that were dropped by a fucking flying saucer and they're watching us.

723
00:42:08.871 --> 00:42:12.410
It's a big experiment.
I didn't get into that.

724
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:17.260
The government has time machines and uh,
the former youth going to come with it.

725
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.290
I never got to like fucking crazy shit,
build a burg and stuff like that.

726
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:22.220
That did fascinate me.

727
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.070
I did get into that shit and then after a while I just became this fucking

728
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:28.460
person who wouldn't stop talking about it and I had no the fuck out of everybody

729
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.140
and I had enough of a need to be like that.
I said,
all right.
All right,

730
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.340
I'm with you guys.
Back to the ignorant masses.
I went back,

731
00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.780
not that I was informed,
but it was part of the other thing.

732
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.140
I just got back to the ignorant masses and supposedly ignorant conspiracy

733
00:42:44.141 --> 00:42:48.830
theorist,
ignorant meeting.
Just uninformed.
Not Stupid.
All right.

734
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.430
I went back to the ignorant masses.

735
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.490
Hey ladies,
laser John.
By the way,
out.

736
00:42:56.491 --> 00:43:00.730
Sabato was attacked by a pit bull and survivor of Rah Rah,

737
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.540
Rah and blossom.
Uh,

738
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:08.250
he's wearing a pink dog collar for Teddy Cancer.
Um,
all right.

739
00:43:08.251 --> 00:43:12.600
The goal,
the age of TV sucks.
All right,
deal.

740
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:17.230
Dear Billy Tube.
I know they've dubbed this the golden age of television.

741
00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:21.490
Well,
they would have to accurately call it the second golden age of television

742
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.810
because the first golden age,

743
00:43:22.811 --> 00:43:26.230
I believe was back in the 1950s and the people who called it the golden age

744
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:30.670
where the white people making the television for other white people.
Right.

745
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.330
Uh,
but I eat,
an person says,
I really hate it.

746
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.470
Of course I enjoy some of the shows that are coming up or overall,

747
00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.830
I don't enjoy the experience.

748
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.340
I hate having to select a show on a menu.

749
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.410
It makes it that much easier for me to change it.
15 minutes.

750
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.640
And if I'm not impressed,
dude,
I'm with you.
I'm going back to reading.

751
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.440
I like it better.
I pick up a book,
I read a little bit,
I get sleepy,

752
00:43:59.441 --> 00:44:03.970
I go to sleep done over,
over the,

753
00:44:03.971 --> 00:44:07.180
these fucking streaming services,
you know,
God bless him.

754
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.550
I know the kids love him and I'm old enough for me.

755
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.810
I find it overwhelming and I keep saying,
oh buddy,
am I going,
you know,

756
00:44:13.811 --> 00:44:16.480
some of these streaming things,
it reminds me of a,

757
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.480
Robin Williams made this movie called Moscow on the Hudson,

758
00:44:19.481 --> 00:44:24.190
which I'm sure is on Netflix,
Amazon,
fucking apple,

759
00:44:24.191 --> 00:44:25.450
all these Disney,

760
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.580
all these fucking places that stream HBO and there's a scene he from Russia.

761
00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:33.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

762
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:34.850
<v 0>You know where the stereotype was?</v>

763
00:44:34.851 --> 00:44:38.090
Everybody had to stand in line and the black market sergeants at the lamp here.

764
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.553
Um,

765
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.713
<v 1>okay.</v>

766
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.010
<v 0>And there weren't a lot of choices.
So many defects.</v>

767
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:48.690
The first time he goes to a supermarket and he sees all the choices he has,

768
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.100
he gets so overwhelmed that he faints.
Well,

769
00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.750
that's basically,
I mean,
I don't faint,

770
00:44:55.751 --> 00:44:57.730
but when I go on like a streaming service thing,

771
00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:02.770
I get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of choices that,

772
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.693
uh,

773
00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:09.240
most of my time on the streaming service I spend scrolling through shit.

774
00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:15.610
And in the end I just go,
you know what?
Fuck this.

775
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.310
It's literally like,
do you know,

776
00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:24.020
like when you got to do your taxes in for an entire year,

777
00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:27.980
you just through every your seat into this box and there's no organization to it

778
00:45:27.981 --> 00:45:31.070
whatsoever.
And then one day you got to open it up and you just,

779
00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:35.540
you don't even know where the fuck to begin.
Uh,
that's how I feel.
So,

780
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.433
um,

781
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.830
I am a big believer now and getting back,

782
00:45:41.831 --> 00:45:46.480
I'm just going to try to get back into reading and I walk away from my phone
now.

783
00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:50.230
I tried for a couple of hours each day.
I just,
I just haven't,

784
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.490
you know,
shut off or somewhere else and I gotta be honest.

785
00:45:54.491 --> 00:45:56.310
I'm not missing anything.
I've never

786
00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:57.790
<v 1>okay</v>

787
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:59.350
<v 0>had any sort of urgent</v>

788
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.960
call or anything or any opportunity that I missed.

789
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:06.810
And it's Kinda nice to just sort of fucking walk away from it.

790
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.020
And then when he come up to your phone after a couple hours is kind of exciting

791
00:46:10.021 --> 00:46:13.470
because you have all these fucking text messages so he can get right back and

792
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:16.860
get a nice hit of the crack.
It's kind of Nice.
It's kind of a nice thing.

793
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:22.930
Um,
so if you've noticed a change in me,
um,

794
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.850
as I explore being sober,

795
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:31.450
I want you guys to know that I promise you I will continue to get more and more

796
00:46:32.841 --> 00:46:33.674
preachy

797
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.080
I'm going to be doing,
I just feel like for me,

798
00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:46.081
reading and being conscious of a higher power,

799
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.800
how many people have said that while we're in like fucking red bottom shoes?

800
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:56.510
Um,
that's one of my favorite characters out here in Hollywood.

801
00:46:56.511 --> 00:47:01.511
The caring whore used to be the horror with a heart of gold.

802
00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.100
Now it's the caring whore.

803
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:05.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

804
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:10.120
<v 0>You ever heard of the giving tree?
The sequel is the caring whore.
All right.
Uh,</v>

805
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.250
slavery in Libya.

806
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:17.550
I'm gonna alone by Botox faced celebrity influencer.

807
00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

808
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.710
<v 0>Instagram page to this cause cause I just feel that guy just so totally just</v>

809
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:29.040
like,
hey,
I gotta tell you something.

810
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:29.980
I was listening to Howard stern

811
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.180
<v 1>the other day and he was doing this fucking thing about one of these bachelor's</v>

812
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:35.320
shows.
And this guy had,

813
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.260
I had never heard anybody say this because I learned this back when I was at

814
00:47:38.261 --> 00:47:42.490
Emerson College.
Vocal fry vocal fry.
Basically.

815
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:46.400
It basically occurs when you're not pushing enough air through your voice box

816
00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:50.050
and it causes you to talk like this.
And it's really weird because when people,

817
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.430
when they start to get more intense,

818
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:54.040
they're still not pushing enough air and it just gets louder and it's really

819
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:54.940
fucking annoying.

820
00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.690
He's want to take a firehose and jam it down their fucking throat.
Um,

821
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.570
so anyways,
um,
okay.

822
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.300
<v 0>He was talking about this person on the show,</v>

823
00:48:06.301 --> 00:48:10.020
this guy who add vocal fry and they were some,

824
00:48:10.021 --> 00:48:13.170
I don't know how the fuck they did this,
but they started playing

825
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:16.340
lamb of God and I love that band,

826
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:22.630
but they were just playing the singer singing without any of the instruments and

827
00:48:22.701 --> 00:48:24.500
just,
just his vocal track.

828
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:30.370
I was fucking dying laughing because it fits perfectly with the band and the

829
00:48:31.401 --> 00:48:33.260
band is fucking awesome and I love it.

830
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.170
But when you just take that guy out by himself,

831
00:48:36.171 --> 00:48:40.070
like I was fucking punching the steering wheel.
I was laughing so hard.

832
00:48:40.071 --> 00:48:43.840
So if you guys can somehow find that I haven't,
I'll do a little search.

833
00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:46.130
You'll see if it's available to save you some fucking time.

834
00:48:46.131 --> 00:48:49.790
If you drive any new car here.
Let's see here.
Um,

835
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:54.820
how were stern lamb of God vocal track?

836
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.490
Let me see if this comes up.

837
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

838
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:04.540
<v 0>MMM.</v>

839
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.040
<v 1>Okay.</v>

840
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.790
<v 0>Ban.
It doesn't,
Oh fuck you.
It was,</v>

841
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.050
it was the one of the great,
I dunno,

842
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:17.930
I'm sure somebody who knows how to search better than me.
Um,

843
00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:22.110
I'm going to start sharing my seeker,
um,
slavery in Libya.

844
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:23.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

845
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.900
<v 0>Uh,
dear Billy elect.
Um,</v>

846
00:49:26.901 --> 00:49:31.901
have you heard about how much of a fuck show Libya is ever since the Hillary

847
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.170
Clinton brought down Kadafi how did she do it?

848
00:49:36.171 --> 00:49:38.250
I didn't know she did that they had,

849
00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:43.820
that's the latest thing to blame her for a,
they had a complete breakdown in,

850
00:49:43.821 --> 00:49:46.160
they're already suffering society.

851
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:47.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

852
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:52.160
<v 0>Um,
all right.
They have open air slavery.</v>

853
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:55.730
Oh,
you got to hate when it,
when it goes outside,
you know,

854
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.440
as long as it's inside,
I think,
you know,
open air slavery,
Jesus,

855
00:50:00.441 --> 00:50:05.150
I could get contagious and it's got so bad that the u s troops had the pull out

856
00:50:05.151 --> 00:50:09.380
because it wasn't safe for them.
Now,
the person gave me a link,
but it was to,
uh,

857
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.850
the Washington Post and then I got to read like half an article and they got me

858
00:50:13.851 --> 00:50:16.430
interested in.
Then they're like,
hey man,
if you want to read the rest of us,

859
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.610
why don't you subscribe?
Oh my gosh,
your dollar big boy.
Um,

860
00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:23.600
so I had to go to some other site and try to figure out what the fuck's going on

861
00:50:23.601 --> 00:50:28.240
there.
He said,
it makes no sense that we do this shit other than

862
00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.040
<v 1>someone powerful controls our armies to help their business interests.</v>

863
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.420
Uh,
you know,
you had such a great point to make and you left out some word.

864
00:50:37.421 --> 00:50:40.840
It makes words.
It makes no sense that we do this shit

865
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.790
<v 0>other than</v>

866
00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:50.690
someone powerful controls our armies to help their business interests.

867
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.660
Yeah.
Well Libby is saying that is bullshit.

868
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.690
They're saying this is just a smear campaign,

869
00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:02.310
which the world is so fucked up right now.
I would actually listen to that.
Like,

870
00:51:02.311 --> 00:51:05.970
okay,
well now are we using this as an excuse to invade them?

871
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:10.090
But it seems like we're leaving.
I Dunno.

872
00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.440
Are these people that are being enslaved,

873
00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:21.570
are they lucky enough to be being enslaved on land that has a lot of oil

874
00:51:22.511 --> 00:51:26.710
underneath it?
Because if it does,
the calvary is common,

875
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:32.080
which is regular earth with dirt underneath it.
Uh,
yeah,
they're in trouble,
man.

876
00:51:32.081 --> 00:51:34.450
It's fucked up.
I,
it's,
well this is one of the stories.

877
00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:37.040
I read a little bit about it.
That's why I try not to,
uh,

878
00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:42.910
look at this shit,
which I know,
isn't that what he's supposed to do?

879
00:51:42.911 --> 00:51:46.210
He's supposed to stay informed and try to help fellow human beings.

880
00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:52.510
Um,
I dunno.
I gotta be honest with you.

881
00:51:52.511 --> 00:51:53.620
It was super depressing.

882
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.860
The pictures and everything that I saw it and it just makes no sense to me that

883
00:51:56.861 --> 00:52:01.840
I get lucky enough to be born where I am and how I look.

884
00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.260
Not Saying I'm good looking and saying I got lucky enough to be born a white

885
00:52:05.261 --> 00:52:09.960
dude and
what the fuck wrong thing that they do.

886
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:13.170
They're born in different parts of the world.
Look different.

887
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:17.110
Nobody fucking wants him in the air.
The refugees,
I dunno.

888
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:22.750
It's a fucking shame.
I have no idea how to stop it.

889
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:28.420
Um,
if anybody has any suggestions.

890
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.000
Um,
by the way,

891
00:52:31.001 --> 00:52:35.320
I'm still trying to set up a charity for a fucking local high school.

892
00:52:35.321 --> 00:52:37.390
I can't believe how fucking difficult it is.

893
00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:42.810
Trying to find a fucking place to do it where I can also dictate where I want

894
00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:50.100
the money to go.
Finding an ice school to do a charity,

895
00:52:50.101 --> 00:52:53.890
it is not that difficult,
but finding one that's that,
that you can actually say,

896
00:52:53.891 --> 00:52:56.020
okay,
now this is just going to go to this,
right?

897
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.050
This isn't going to go to the teacher's lounge.
Fucking

898
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.100
we bank for spring break.
All right.

899
00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:07.050
Wife won't let me drive.

900
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

901
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:12.190
<v 0>A buddy.
I got to tell you something right now.
MMM.</v>

902
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.270
The uphill battle you're going to have with me to this next paragraph is shit

903
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:21.200
that I'm going to read is trying to somehow win back my respect.

904
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.840
All right.
Why won't let you drive?

905
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:28.520
The only way I respect in this situation is if you're a fucking raging alcoholic

906
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:33.480
missing at least two,
if not three limbs.
Other than that I,

907
00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.400
I dunno.

908
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:40.520
Did you lose your balls in a farming accident that John Cougar Mellencamp right,

909
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.220
right.
A fucking song about your testes.
All right,
Bill.

910
00:53:43.221 --> 00:53:44.990
I'm in a very strange situation.

911
00:53:44.991 --> 00:53:48.770
My wife and I have seven years have not been getting along very well.

912
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:54.380
Um,
then the last year or so it's gotten worse.
Well,
you need to work on it,

913
00:53:54.381 --> 00:53:59.330
dude.
You got to work on it.
It's hard,
man.
Marriage is work.
Uh,

914
00:53:59.331 --> 00:54:03.740
we argue all the time mainly because she starts fighting fights over everything.

915
00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.690
She doesn't respect me at all and she's always comparing me to other guys she

916
00:54:08.691 --> 00:54:11.180
works with.
Ooh.
Yeah.

917
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.840
I was already a red flag when she fights over everything.

918
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.840
This sounds like miss directed.

919
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

920
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.030
<v 0>I would say topic anger.</v>

921
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.750
She is mad at you or maybe she's mad at herself from Mary when she does,
I dunno.

922
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:25.951
Anyways,

923
00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:30.951
last month someone backed into me in a parking lot and dented my car a bit.

924
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:37.140
She told me it was my fault for not being a responsible enough driver,

925
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.470
even though it happened while I was 10 feet away.

926
00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:42.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

927
00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:44.410
<v 0>In the already parked car.</v>

928
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

929
00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:49.410
<v 0>What?
So now when we go places,</v>

930
00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:53.700
she demands to drive because I'm not a strong enough driver.

931
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.380
This clearly,
this is to clearly emasculate me.

932
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.780
I'm planning on filing for divorce,

933
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:03.330
but I have to get my affairs in order to first,

934
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:08.670
do you have any advice on how to deal with this in the meantime?
Thanks.

935
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:10.200
All right.
This is a hail Mary.

936
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.190
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

937
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:17.030
<v 0>they hail Mary is,
you got to,
this is possibly,</v>

938
00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.680
might have to do with the way you conduct yourself and your business.

939
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:27.880
And that's why she lost respect for you.
And she wants you to fucking man up.

940
00:55:27.881 --> 00:55:32.290
So she's pushing your buttons to see if he got any man in.
Yeah,
I might be wrong.

941
00:55:32.291 --> 00:55:35.860
She might just say in order to be banging somebody work.
All right,

942
00:55:35.861 --> 00:55:39.520
but the Hail Mary here,
you know,

943
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:45.520
I don't know.
I think you got to fuck the shit out of.
You got to put one on her.

944
00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.710
You got to dicker down,
dude.
That's what you gotta do.

945
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.300
Okay,
you got it.
You got to bring that fucking,
uh,

946
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:03.090
you know,
back from overseas.
Dick.
That's what you got it.

947
00:56:03.091 --> 00:56:04.960
You got to come at her with that.

948
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.890
If that doesn't get her fucking motor running again,
then I think this is a wrap.

949
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:12.490
But um,
yeah,

950
00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:17.491
it's some point a long time ago you should have put your foot down and Ben like,

951
00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.250
shut the fuck up.
I'm driving my own car.

952
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.270
If you don't want know,
sit in the fucking back seat.

953
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:27.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

954
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:30.190
<v 0>Deploy the airbag before we even go if you want.
I don't give a fuck.</v>

955
00:56:30.191 --> 00:56:32.900
I'm drive and go fuck yourself.
Um,

956
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:34.990
<v 1>okay.</v>

957
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:36.260
<v 0>All right.
Well you filed for divorce.</v>

958
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.760
It doesn't seem like there's any kids or whatever,
but it's just like,

959
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:42.810
I would just,
I'd sit down and I'd ask her and be like,
can I ask you a question?

960
00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:46.650
Like,
why?
Why are you fucking mad at me all the time?

961
00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:49.260
And I gotta be honest with you.
Start,
stop being,

962
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:55.400
stop being such a bitch.
Jesus Christ your fucking car.

963
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.450
What do you like an accountant and she's like a up and coming MMA and you're

964
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:05.980
worried she's gonna kick the shit out of you.
Then I understand that
bad enough.

965
00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:09.220
She's driving your car,
you don't have to put you in a fucking triangle,
right.

966
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:15.070
Or worst spinning back fist.
Oh,
that'd be the fucking worst,
right.

967
00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:18.010
By the kitchen island.
You know,
whack your head on the corner of it.

968
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.960
Wake up covered in fruit loops in a broken cereal bowl.
You can't have that.

969
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.280
Can't have that.
Um,
yeah,

970
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.840
that would be my instinct.
I would stand up for myself and I would,
uh,

971
00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.230
you know,
do you remember when that dude in that movie?

972
00:57:35.231 --> 00:57:39.490
Fuck that chick on the stairs.
You remember the one I'm talking about,
right?

973
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:43.950
That history of violence.
Yeah.
You got to come with the hitman.

974
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.700
He was,
uh,
he was coming.

975
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:56.990
He was given to the family man.
Dick.
Up until then,
I'm all overrated.
Uh,

976
00:57:56.991 --> 00:58:00.800
responsibilities.
All right.
Overrated.

977
00:58:00.801 --> 00:58:04.970
Underrated for the week.
Uh,
overrated responsibilities.
Uh,
Bill,

978
00:58:04.971 --> 00:58:09.971
I've started streamlining my life and I don't do and deal with shit.

979
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.000
I don't,
uh,
I don't deal with shit.

980
00:58:14.001 --> 00:58:18.530
I want to what you guys do.
Voice Tech sees things.

981
00:58:18.531 --> 00:58:22.970
I've started streaming my life and I don't do and deal with shit.
I want to,

982
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.540
I don't even know where to go with that.
Do I have to fix this?

983
00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:34.650
I started streaming living my life.
I don't do shit.
I don't want to.

984
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

985
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:39.270
<v 0>I don't do or deal with shit.
I don't want to,
I think is what he's trying to say.</v>

986
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:44.510
I recently changed companies and have a job that is lower on the totem pole but

987
00:58:44.671 --> 00:58:47.880
pays more on the fuck.
Did you do that?

988
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.950
I used to think I wanted to be a boss.
I don't.
Good man.

989
00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:57.300
Smart man.
I want to make money and have flexible hours.

990
00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:00.720
Have have flexible hours.
He wrote it twice.
He's so committed to this.

991
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.850
Fuck your big goals.
Bill,

992
00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:07.260
burr key podcasting and find yourself a nice rocking chair.

993
00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:08.993
<v 1>MMM.</v>

994
00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:13.490
<v 0>Well I dunno why my goals should fucking affect you.</v>

995
00:59:13.491 --> 00:59:16.610
I like how the fact that I have big goals.
I don't have big goals.

996
00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:22.540
I got a little freckled red goals.
When they're my goals,

997
00:59:22.541 --> 00:59:26.830
they're mine.
How dare you,
how I'm living my truth.

998
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:32.680
Um,
keep podcasting and find yourself a nice rocket chair.
Dude.

999
00:59:32.681 --> 00:59:36.160
If you don't fucking think that I'm not trying to work towards that.

1000
00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:41.050
I've gotten way,
way,
way more fucking busier than I ever wanted to be.

1001
00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:45.160
Everyone had to be.
I wanted to do all this shit that I'm doing,

1002
00:59:45.161 --> 00:59:47.530
but I had no fucking idea how much time it took.

1003
00:59:47.531 --> 00:59:51.430
And now that I know that I am stepping back,
I am assessing the situation.

1004
00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:53.943
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1005
00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:56.310
<v 0>As Fun as my life is this,</v>

1006
00:59:56.311 --> 00:59:59.040
there's nothing better than being at home with my wife and my kid.

1007
00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.250
My funniest thing my kids doing now,
right there is a

1008
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:03.703
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1009
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:08.170
<v 0>Is when she knows she's going to bed and all the things she tries to do to</v>

1010
01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:12.730
extend her time up.
Like,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll brush teeth,

1011
01:00:12.731 --> 01:00:16.060
brush teeth,
you know,
uh,
close your doors,
close your doors.

1012
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:21.100
[inaudible] we read a book,
we book.
Oh,
we book.

1013
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:27.340
She goes,
oh.
And then he just sit there,
go,
no,
honey,
it's time to go to bed.

1014
01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:32.370
Tired,
go to bed.
And then she tries to cry,
but she's not crying.
She just goes,
ah,

1015
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.430
like fucking Lucille Ball.
It's hilarious.
Um,

1016
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:40.240
but we still give it a little bubba with the in and when she sees that,

1017
01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.400
that's her scotch for the night,
you know?
Um,
anyways,

1018
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.243
<v 1>uh,</v>

1019
01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.930
<v 0>yeah.
Believe me,
dude,
believe me,
if I,</v>

1020
01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.750
if I could figure out a way to get off the fucking wheel,
it's not how it works.

1021
01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.820
So it's not how it works,

1022
01:00:56.821 --> 01:01:00.060
then I can have a bunch of fucking people retiring at 50.

1023
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:04.330
They keep,
well,
they want to keep making money.
What they do is like,
all right,

1024
01:01:04.331 --> 01:01:07.150
we're going to keep,
they keep taking a bite out of your ass.

1025
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.630
You know,
the only way you weren't tired.
Fifties.

1026
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:14.360
If you have some disease and you know,
you're gonna be dead at 54,

1027
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:18.520
that's the only way I see how to do it.
You know,
and there's all downsides.

1028
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:22.190
You laugh,
go live in a fucking trailer and,
and,
and then what?

1029
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:27.410
As they constantly come up with new ways to fucking tax people,
my nest egg,

1030
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:30.590
they'll,
they'll go after it.
It's fucking Lee.

1031
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:32.300
They little this literally Americans right now,

1032
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:34.940
co-signing signing on taxing fellow Americans,

1033
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.490
70% on fucking earned income.

1034
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Honest fucking Americans as they look the other way on $20 trillion in untaxed

1035
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:49.750
evil fucking non tax paying American cons money sitting in the fucking Cayman

1036
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.760
Islands,
that's too much of a hassle.

1037
01:01:52.761 --> 01:01:55.250
They don't want to take the fucking bag all the way to the curb.

1038
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.360
They're going to sit on the couch and fucking picker some regular dude off.

1039
01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:04.220
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,
anyways,
I don't.
Good,
good for you buddy.

1040
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:08.390
If you can figure out how to do it,
if you can figure out how to do it.

1041
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.200
And I would say one of the biggest things you want to streamline your life is do

1042
01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:17.201
not have a woman in your fucking life because they cannot stop buying shit.

1043
01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.940
It's,
it's insane.
It is fucking insane.

1044
01:02:22.941 --> 01:02:27.470
And whoever came up with the mall is a fucking genius because that shit is just

1045
01:02:27.471 --> 01:02:32.471
visual fucking crack to most women just walk and meandering around those things.

1046
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.050
What do they about this?
Does this look cute?

1047
01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.070
They encourage you thought you should get it.
You are so,
oh my God,

1048
01:02:40.071 --> 01:02:44.520
you should totally get that.
I guide tie dye.

1049
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.360
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1050
01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.480
<v 0>fucking dopes.
And all they do is sit there saying that they should,
you know,</v>

1051
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:50.561
hey ladies,

1052
01:02:50.561 --> 01:02:54.640
maybe you should earn the same amount as a man to see what the same job.

1053
01:02:54.641 --> 01:02:58.210
When you can show yourself to be a little more fiscally responsible,

1054
01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.493
what do you want to make?

1055
01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:05.050
Can you imagine if I said this at a woman's college?
God,

1056
01:03:05.051 --> 01:03:07.480
I Miss Doing College gigs.
Um,

1057
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:10.060
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1058
01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.640
<v 0>ladies,
maybe,
you know,</v>

1059
01:03:12.641 --> 01:03:16.750
if he didn't fucking buy something off of Amazon every fucking two days,

1060
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:20.010
<v 1>okay,</v>

1061
01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.710
<v 0>maybe then maybe then Uncle Sam will give you more money.</v>

1062
01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:27.030
I don't even know if that's even fucking true that they make less money.
I Dunno.

1063
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:30.170
I could tell you right now,
if they got paid by the world word,

1064
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:33.660
they fucking run the world.
Ah,
Jesus Bell.

Let's not start to,

1065
01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:38.340
let's not do this.
Let's keep it happy.
Okay?

1068
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.050
Do you know?
I never had the balls to try a Cadbury egg.

1069
01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1070
01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.060
<v 0>I was always confused.
I thought it was a real egg.</v>

1071
01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.440
I didn't understand that there was some sort,
I would guess some sort of custard.

1072
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:01.761
All right.

1073
01:04:01.761 --> 01:04:05.150
We're going to end this podcast by finally finding out what the fuck it was so

1074
01:04:05.151 --> 01:04:08.620

<v 1>Okay.</v>

1078
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.190
<v 0>What is in them?</v>

1079
01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.600
I got to be the dumbest person on the fucking Internet.

1080
01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:24.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1081

Okay,
thank you.
I can recreate.

1086
01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:49.490
An egg is a chocolate confection produced in the shape of an egg.

1087
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.840
All right,
so it's just a desert.

1088
01:04:50.841 --> 01:04:54.620
They have it in the shape of an egg originating from the British British

1089
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:57.230
chocolate tier Cadbury.

1090
01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:02.940
You make chocolate.
Oh,

boy.
I like chocolate a.

1091
01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.190
The product consists of thick chocolate shell.
Okay.

1092
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.930
It is what we need.
Housing,

1093
01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:14.320
the sweet white and yellow fondant filling.

1094

<v 1>Okay.</v>

1095
01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.000
<v 0>Okay.

<v 1>fondant?</v>

1097
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.920
<v 0>Sounds like it would come out of a fountain.</v>

1098
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.810
It'd be a bunch of chicks dip and shit into it.

1099
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:30.580
Fondant technologies,
wait a minute.

1100
01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:37.230
Found out is the most popular cake decoration topping.

1101
01:05:37.231 --> 01:05:39.240
It can be colored and easily shaped.

1102
01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:44.610
What the fuck is what is in fondant?

1103
01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.840
Fondant?
I spelled it wrong.

1104
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:56.900
Phone is a type of icing.
It's icing

1105
01:05:58.930 --> 01:05:59.681
fondant.
Kim.

1106
01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:04.270
Refer to two types of sugar base pace used in preparing decorating cakes,

1107
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:05.620
pastries,
confections.

1108
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.100
I said fucking word again.
Confection.

1109
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:16.910
Feel like a fucking don't want us a sleuth right now for desserts.

1110
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.780
Fondant filling,
which mimics the album in it.

1111
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:23.800
<v 1>Okay,</v>

Owl Boom,</v>

1113
01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:29.800
and I spelled it right.

1114
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:34.660
M e n n m.
A N

1115
01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:41.030
album man,
the white of an egg.

1116
01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:44.960
Okay,
let's put this in layman's term.

1117
01:06:44.961 --> 01:06:49.961
A Cadbury creme egg is a chocolate dessert produced in the shape of an egg

1118
01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.200
originating from the British chocolate guys.
Cadbury.

1119
01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.310
The product consists of a thick chocolate shell housing,

1120
01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.090
a sweet yellow icing filling,
which mimics the

1121
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.830
egg yolk white.
Now though the white egg,

1122
01:07:06.831 --> 01:07:11.831
white and yolk of a chicken egg there,

1123
01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.410
now I know what the fuck it is.

1124
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.590
Should I do an Instagram video of me actually eating one of those fucking
things.

1125
01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.930
Good.
God Almighty.
Who would the fuck thought of that?

1126
01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:29.180
It's kind of creative.

1127
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:30.840
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1128
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.620
<v 0>Then they had the fucking,
it was always threw me off.</v>

1129
01:07:32.621 --> 01:07:35.200
I always thought it was a fucking egg,
but you know what,
then good.
You know what?

1130
01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:39.080
Hat's off to those chocolate tiers because you fooled me for fucking 30 years.

1131
01:07:39.081 --> 01:07:42.320
I thought it was a fucking egg.
All right.

1132
01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.220
I know you're never going to get those fucking four minutes back.
William.

1133
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:50.600
I apologize.
I'll do a benefit for all of you,
okay.
For your living your truth.

1134
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.890

The exciting conclusion to premiere league soccer.

1138
01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.500
Well,
the two best teams are on a collision course to not play each other.

1139

Um,
