00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.920
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.540
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Dan.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.280
<v 1>Ah,
uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.223
<v 0>yes.
Checking out here.</v>

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.770
Just checking in on Ya dumb officially out of ways to say that and there's a

6
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.280
hole in this little hole in the wall in this fucking room.

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.320
These guys fix the pipes because there was galvanized piping in here and uh,

8
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.750
I never got this whole fixed.

9
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.050
Just fucking realize that that's how fucked up my house is.

10
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:32.861
You know what I realized?

11
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:36.880
I talk about my house so much that there's somebody sitting there going like,

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.800
eventually he's going to run out of money probably right when the house is 98%

13
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:43.750
fixed and I'm going to swoop in and buy it.

14
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.390
And he's gone in and redone everything,

15
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.900
redid everything I'm speaking of which I got the epoxy floor put in on my gym.

16
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.740
I went downstairs to look at it.
I was like,
oh boy.
Oh boy.

17
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.040
What'd you look at?
Dead floor.
You can eat off.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
And I went in there,

18
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.360
boom,
ba boom,
ba was bubbles.

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.950
So they got to add another layer because you know my floor is not level at all.

20
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.020
His fucking shed.
We've got to float the floor.

21
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:16.940
That's going to cost you all this money.
Maybe you fill in the cracks,
but

22
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.200
now the grand out the window say I don't even care anymore.

23
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.500
I just laugh now.
When contractors come up to me,
what do you,
what do you want?

24
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:27.334
What do you like?

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.940
It's like that old Robin Williams story that if you just walked up to him at

26
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:33.100
some point you said,
hey man,
I'm Robin.
I'm a comedian.

27
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:37.210
He would just write you a check for 100 bucks.
They,
sorry.
Sorry.

28
00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:39.550
If I riffed on some of your shit,
my apologies.

29
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.850
This is what I do now with contract to show up.
Yeah,
I want to,
yeah,
I know.
Well,

30
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.030
how much time can I just go into my pocket?
Oh,
do I need the checkbook?

31
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.070
Do I got to write numbers on a piece of paper just never ends.

32
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.000
It never ends.
And meanwhile,
meanwhile,

33
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.440
as I wait for the gym to be made,

34
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.760
I am sitting in the writer's room doing f is for family and two things have

35
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:05.650
happened.
I'm,
I'm putting on writer's room.
Wait,
my gym is in fucking made at,
uh,

36
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.690
you know,
I'm fucking,
uh,
I felt like the last,

37
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:13.570
I don't know if I've talked to you guys about my fucking left leg,

38
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.270
my hamstrings tighten up.
You know,

39
00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:19.020
you ever see the guy run down the first base line and I'll say,
hey,

40
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.320
starts fucking hoppin.
Oh,

41
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:23.700
that guy in the Celtics and game one year run it up the court.

42
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.290
He just fucking collapses.
I was like,
oh,
did I,

43
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.470
did I literally pull a hamstring doing stand up because God knows I haven't been

44
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:36.850
working out.
And um,
and you know what,
I ended up figuring it out.

45
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:40.210
What it was is a,
it's from sitting down in the fucking writer's room.
Like,

46
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:43.270
I guess sitting is not healthy.

47
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.370
It's one of the most unhealthy things she could do.

48
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:50.371
I guess you body's not designed the way that we set the way that we've made

49
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:53.470
chairs.
Just plop your ass down,
whatever it is,
blood flow.

50
00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:58.150
I don't know what the fuck it is.
So all fucking Billy Budd cheeks here.

51
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.860
Now I've got a problem with my fucking sciatic nerve on my left side.

52
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.580
So I literally had to have my lovely wife buy one of those foam rollers,

53
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.863
right?

54
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.000
It's just how all the way up is from Siddiq all right.

55
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.010
And you,
you literally,
I looked up some lay on the fucking internet who had like,

56
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.490
I looked up the proper way to do it before I did it because I know that you can

57
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:25.420
fuck you body up.

58
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.850
Like people get these things and they just start rolling around on them.

59
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.830
And I immediately learned first thing,

60
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.050
you don't want to roll over joints as all this shit and is all this proper form.

61
00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:34.420
So I went through about two or three videos.

62
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.540
So I got to somebody who all the comments were like,
oh my God,

63
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:40.570
your form's perfect and all that.
So I was,
I was watching this woman.

64
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So basically what I do is I sit down on the thing and then cross my legs is she

65
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.700
says cowboy style,
not lady like cowboy style,

66
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.500
which is basically like if I was wearing a skirt,
my balls would be hanging out.

67
00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:00.310
Right.
Sorry for the visual.
Um,

68
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.120
you sit like that and then you sort of put your weight on one side and you,

69
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.410
and I got to tell you,
dude,

70
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.930
the fucking pain that I was in,
it isn't like a,

71
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:14.910
uh,
it,
it isn't like a,
like a severe pain.
It was like the,

72
00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:19.180
if you had an older brother and you know when he would be fucking with you and

73
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:23.710
he,
I sorta start twisting your arm,
you'd be like,
ah,
like that,

74
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:28.330
that type of a fucking paint.
And um,
I got to tell you that the,

75
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:33.210
the foam roller is a goddamn game changer when,
if I didn't have to go in.

76
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.700
But the thing is I kind of work it out and it's fine.
Hey,
work it out,
you know?

77
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.190
But then I go and I'm in a writer's room all day,

78
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:42.400
so I keep trying to stand up and that type of shit and I'm feeling like it's two

79
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:46.360
steps forward and one step back,
but I'm at least moving in the right direction.

80
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.680
So I just putting that out there.
If you do,
um,

81
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.740
have any of those types of problems,
uh,
get one of those.

82
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.870
This has been working for me.
I should say.

83
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.700
I'm not a doctor and I don't play one on TV,
but this has been working for me.

84
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.220
And if you're young,
uh,
I would start doing yoga is soon.

85
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.280
She can,
it's,
I'm telling you,
I,
I've known this forever,

86
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:13.180
but I just get bored with Shit.
I'll do yoga and be like,

87
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:13.991
I'm just going to do Joe.

88
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:18.130
Good give we book a day and then I just get burned out and then I'm like,

89
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:20.500
you know what?
Fuck Yoga.
You know,

90
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.550
I get mad at yoga rather than myself for being totally fucking obsessed with

91
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:28.120
shit for like 10 days until I just,
you know,

92
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.440
I did that with chipotle a long time ago when I lived in New York City.
You know,

93
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.530
if you have a move to New York City,
which I hope you do,

94
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.050
everybody should try fucking live there.
It's great.
You know,

95
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.000
until you get into your thirties and it's like,
oh,

96
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:42.420
am I going to be one of those cat people?
I gotta get Outta here,
right?

97
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.410
I want some space,
you know?
Um,
but when you live there,

98
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.280
you know,
you start ordering out does how it works and you move there,

99
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.430
you're fucking terrified.
Like,
how the fuck am I going to afford to live here?

100
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:57.320
And you fucking eat spaghetti every fucking night,
right?

101
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.260
And then you start making a little more money and every once in a while you take

102
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.680
a cab and you're like,
oh my God,
I'm taking a cab.

103
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.390
This is fucking amazing.

104
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.420
And then he'd get back to your apartment and you have all this guilt because you

105
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:10.670
blew all that money.
And you could have just spent,
you know,

106
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.850
whatever the fuck it was back in the day,

107
00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:16.220
it was like a dollar 25 to take the subway.
Yeah,
I know.
That's how old I am.
Um,

108
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.790
and then you start making it a little more than money.

109
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.700
Then all of a sudden you start ordering out,
right?
He started ordering it out.

110
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.310
You start to get to know all the restaurants and all that type of shit.

111
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.790
And then when she had the money to order out,
what immediately happens is,

112
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:32.840
is this a radius within which that they'll deliver and you burn out every

113
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:35.870
fucking restaurant around you and then you become,

114
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.560
then you're officially in New Yorker when you're living in Manhattan and you're

115
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.020
bitching that there's no good restaurants in your neighborhood.

116
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.920
There's no good to town and you can't get good Italian.
I don't understand why.

117
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.840
I mean,
there's so many people here.
It'd be the foot traffic.
Alo,

118
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.390
why don't they put in it an Italian fucking restaurant?

119
00:06:51.391 --> 00:06:53.540
And he started flipping out like,
whatever your favorite food is,

120
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.870
you bitching that it's not there.
Um,
so whatever.

121
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.790
So this chipotle ends up opening up after I tried every fucking restaurant 15

122
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:05.990
times in my little fucking three block radius.
And I went to that fucking thing.

123
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.960
Like I swear to God,
I went there like,
I dunno,

124
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.910
maybe 11 days in a month.
I will never forget how I felt that last time.

125
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.200
I felt like I was at the end of like a food eating contests where you were just

126
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.770
telling your jaw to keep moving up and down with the rest of your body was like,

127
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.240
can we just a puke now?
And um,
I don't think I've ever,

128
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:30.020
I don't think I've been this sense chipolte lay and Thai food.

129
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.560
It was a Thai food restaurant down the street.

130
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:35.540
And I remember I ordered it and it was delicious.

131
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.330
And then it sat in my fridge for two,
three days and I said,
hey,

132
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:39.320
you know what I think I do.

133
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.530
I'll do what I'm going to eat that three day you'll Thai food,
see how that does.

134
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.470
And I got food poisoning.
And,
um,

135
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.100
rather than being the mature person and taking the responsibility on my end,

136
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.010
I blame Thai food.
I was like,
Fuck Thai food,
I'm never eating Thai food again.

137
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:58.340
And I didn't eat that for like 10 years.
And then,
uh,
you know,

138
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.010
eventually became back.
We were a,
we were able to smooth things over,
you know,

139
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.910
like guns n roses,
you know what I mean?
It was exact same thing,

140
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.470
exact same trajectory I had with Thai food,
um,

141
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.890
band members and guns and roses head with axl rose and now they're all back

142
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.710
together and evidently the fucking shows have been great.
Um,

143
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.030
they played in Mexico City the other night and uh,

144
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.730
I would have loved to have gone down to that,
going to that show,

145
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.130
had a great time,
then get kidnapped,
you know,
when that'd be great.

146
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.460
Mexico City scares the shit out of me.
And He,
Mexico people,
Mexicans,

147
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.220
real ones,
real ones.
I don't mean the one's here in la.
I mean,

148
00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:40.490
the real fucking deal.
You're in Mexico,
you know what I mean?
Like,

149
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.580
I'm German Irish,
but I don't live in Deutschland or fucking the,

150
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.580
the emerald aisle.
You know what I mean?
I lived in Massachusetts,

151
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.780
I went to friendly's.
You know,
I'm not a crowd,
right?

152
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.990
So let me,
let,
let me ask you this,
because it's right there.

153
00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.910
It's fucking a quick plane right away.
There's all these beautiful places to go.

154
00:09:00.911 --> 00:09:02.920
And then there's all these other fucked up places to go.

155
00:09:02.921 --> 00:09:06.730
I don't know where to go.
I don't know where to go.
Um,

156
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.270
and uh,
you know,

157
00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:15.271
all they show about you guys is the fucking drug cartels peeling people's faces

158
00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:19.600
back.
You know,
and I know there's no fucking way all of Mexico,

159
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.840
everybody's just walking around,
peeling off each other's faces.

160
00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:25.420
I know there's no fucking way that that's happening.
I know there's,

161
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.373
it's like here,

162
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.130
I bet people outside of this country think everybody walks down the street with

163
00:09:30.131 --> 00:09:33.940
a fucking gun on their hip.
You know,
when they don't have money for a tall,

164
00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:37.270
they shoot the guy in the toll booths.
And then some stage coach comes in,

165
00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:39.650
I don't know what the fuck they think.
Right?
Or they think we're and,

166
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.490
and we're all 300 pounds and we're on fucking meth.

167
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.363
<v 1>Right?</v>

168
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.520
<v 0>We don't know where England is.</v>

169
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.970
I'll let shell like that snobby European shit where they just think they're so

170
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:52.790
fucking cultured.
You know what I mean?

171
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.490
With their little ass fucking countries over there that's driving own.

172
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.080
Am I going to fucking Europe?
I love when they say shit like that.
You know,

173
00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:02.420
you guys don't know about the fucking world.
It's like neither do you.

174
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.690
You don't know what the fuck's going on over in Asia.

175
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:06.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

176
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.260
<v 0>You know what's going on,
right?
And your little fucking area,</v>

177
00:10:09.261 --> 00:10:12.290
but you're a little area for me would just be the east coast.

178
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.900
But for you it's like 15 different fucking countries.

179
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.530
Belgium and fucking Luxembourg.
I mean,

180
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:21.930
you can walk through those two countries so you can sleep,

181
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.680
walk through those two countries from fucking Amsterdam and ended up in France

182
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:27.090
and be like,
Whoa,
what happened?
I'll have shit.

183
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:31.080
I got to go to work and then jog back.
Um,

184
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.190
having said that,
I'd love to go to both places.
Oh,

185
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:39.790
the big phony covered his fucking tracks.
I was gonna go to your show in Belgium.

186
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.990
But after you talked about how small we were.
No,
I'm not going,

187
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.320
um,

188
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.180
controversy on social media today when one person in Belgium took offense.

189
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.600
Um,
so anyways,
they redoing the fucking floors again.

190
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:56.010
So I ended up getting bubbles.

191
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

192
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.180
<v 0>B is four bubbles over that.
Sesame Street,
bubbles,
bubbles,</v>

193
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:04.510
bubbles,
it painful.
Probably Hoopla.

194
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.720
Some of that was that fucking guy with the puberty voice harmonizing.

195
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.930
I think it was supposed to sound like a beach boy type thing,
but it didn't,

196
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:14.840
it was just fucking,
he used to make me like angry when I was a kid.

197
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.690
See if I can find that for you guys and I'll start playing it.

198
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

199
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.100
<v 0>Um,
so anyways,
as always,</v>

200
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.570
I never let myself get too out of shape and I need to drop about 10 pounds.

201
00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:30.050
So I'm Oh fucking,
uh,

202
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.540
freckles here despite the fact I,

203
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.200
the gym isn't made yet and I got to go to work every day.

204
00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:40.130
I'm going to try to lose two pounds a week back up to one 80.

205
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.550
Everybody and I been eating well the last couple of days and always the first

206
00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:46.810
couple of days.
The fact that the just eat well you drop a couple.

207
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.250
So I got on the scale yesterday,
said one 77,

208
00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:52.580
so I must have ate like a fucking tuberous shit the night before when I got on

209
00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:56.730
at one eight about [inaudible] 78.
So I'm just going to go back down to one 68.

210
00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.470
Um,
he right around the time for my birthday and uh,
you know,

211
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.930
two pounds.
That's easy,
right?
A couple of push ups,
you know what I mean?

212
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.480
I'll go on my stupid foam roller.
Oh my God.
I,
I,
you know what,
I'm so fucking old.

213
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:14.040
I think I have to bring it to work.

214
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.840
<v 0>How fucking hilarious.
I said I'm going to walk in with that thing at work and,</v>

216
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.990
and I'm going to walk in to a room full of comedy writers.

217
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:26.070
Does he drew understand the pounding that I'm going to fucking take.
Let me get,

218
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.900
oh,
that's going to actually fuck up our work for today.

219
00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:31.830
Cause they're going to spend the first two hours trashing me.
Um,

220
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.970
and what am I going to do other than fucking take it?
That's it.

221
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.360
There's nothing I can fucking do.
Oh,
by the way,
by the way,

222
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:43.500
is I'm all over the fucking map here.
Did you fucking see that?

223
00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:45.810
Shameless fucking Hillary Clinton

224
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.670
trying to pander to get the African American vote.
She's on some radio show.

225
00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:55.070
I just watched a clip.
I had to shut it off.
Forgive me.

226
00:12:55.071 --> 00:12:58.130
I don't know what radio show it is,
but she's sitting there.

227
00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:01.130
She goes and she's trying to get the black vote and she,

228
00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:04.640
they asked you what's something you always carry around with you?
And she said,

229
00:13:04.641 --> 00:13:05.750
hot sauce.

230
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.180
The Clintons are the fucking,
I swear to God.

231
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

232
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.600
<v 0>Can't you just see both of them on a used car lot to one of those cheesy local</v>

233
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:22.970
commercials?
Do they had the fucking devil?

234
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

235
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.970
<v 0>I remember when Hillary Clinton ran for fucking,
uh,</v>

236
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.330
Senate after eight years of being in the White House to fucking Yankees said
one,

237
00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:35.230
four world series.
She never showed up,
never said a fucking thing.

238
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:39.520
And then all of a sudden she's running for fucking a Senate in New York,

239
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.160
shows up with a brand new Yaggie head and goes,

240
00:13:42.161 --> 00:13:46.840
I've always been a Yankee fan.
And then this big grand,

241
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:51.430
like I said it now they're going to like me.
This is how out of touch she is.

242
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.370
She literally thinks that she just has to say,
I carry around hot sauce

243
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.740
and all,
all black people are going to be like,
oh shit.
Oh,
I can relate to that.

244
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.970
What's she gonna do next?
You get to go to fucking Chinatown,

245
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.850
which I always carry around soy sauce.

246
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.413
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

247
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.900
<v 0>go down south.
You know,
I love guns and my cousin's,
sorry,</v>

248
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.040
sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.
Um,
hot rods.

249
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.800
I've always liked hot rods.
Fucking shameless.

250
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.130
This is the thing about like when you're at her level of fucking wealth,

251
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:34.570
which is really,
I don't know how you explain it.
You know,
when her husband,

252
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:34.961
you know,

253
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:39.670
had the highest office in public office and you only is president,

254
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.140
you only make four,
500 grand a year.

255
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:43.450
Somehow they through their daughter a $3 million wedding.
I mean,

256
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.190
how does the math work there?

257
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.910
<v 1>Okay,</v>

258
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:51.730
<v 0>they are the fuck she is the fucking devil.
I'm telling you.
You know,</v>

259
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.200
oh my God,
what a fucking selection this year.
Can you fucking believe this shit?

260
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.450
A reality show star.

261
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.140
You know who's sitting there with that fucking,

262
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.840
I don't know what the other guy's name is now talking about the size of their

263
00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:09.490
hands to heaven had did size of your dick debate running for office.

264
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.340
You got Hilary.
You fucking write it.
I'll say it.
She doesn't give a fuck.

265
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.600
This is why I gotta be honest with you.

266
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:21.800
Why I like Republicans better than Democrats because the Republicans at least

267
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.480
have the decency to just show,

268
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:27.200
to openly show you that they don't give a fuck about you and Democrats.

269
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.770
They actually tried to act like they give a fuck how people about people who

270
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:33.920
work for a fucking living.
They don't did the same fucking people.

271
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.920
They just lie about it.
You know?
I swear to God,

272
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.970
if Bernie Sanders would just fucking gold the hallway,

273
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.650
you know what I mean?
Don't stop and Kuwait,

274
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.880
you got to go all the way to Baghdad with these fucking bankers.
Okay?

275
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.930
That's what you gotta do.

276
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.470
You gotta tip over the statue when you got to have all those top level bankers

277
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.210
swinging at the end of a rope.

278
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.490
That's the only way to stick out a start over again.

279
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.060
That's my candidate.
None of them are saying that.
So it's over.

280
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.670
And I know you're thinking bill,
you don't know shit.

281
00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:10.310
And you read conspiracy theory and you know what I say to that?

282
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.140
You're absolutely right.
Okay.
All right,
let's move on.

283
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.340
That was,
uh,
that was,
uh,
that was political comedy right there,
if you will.

284
00:16:20.341 --> 00:16:24.410
If you're wondering what that was supposed to be,
she goes to little Italy.

285
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:27.830
What do you always have in your purse?
A jar of Marinara sauce.

286
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.000
Who's your favorite singer?
Dean Martin.

287
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.630
Oh my God.
Did you see the house?
She looked like she rolled her eyes.

288
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:41.590
I don't want to put like shit on her that,
that's what she fucking did.

289
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.220
That's how out of touch she is.
Hillary Clinton thinks black.

290
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.280
All black people walk around with hot sauce in their purse because white people

291
00:16:50.281 --> 00:16:52.980
don't know how to season food.
Uh,

292
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.400
I'm not saying there aren't some black people to do that,
you know what I mean?

293
00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.293
But you know,

294
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.630
that would also be people who aren't white who look at white people and think

295
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.350
we're all in the upper 1% standing on a yard shooting the shit with one of the

296
00:17:04.351 --> 00:17:08.640
Kennedy's and they're fucking weird in Brendan inbred dentition.

297
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.720
I never understood the Kennedys.
I,
they,
they're from like the nose up.

298
00:17:12.721 --> 00:17:15.690
They're really good looking people,
great hair,
you know,

299
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.400
nice fucking big five head,
you know,
it looks great on TV,

300
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.710
decent eyes,
you know,
and then you just get to that,
you get to those,
those,

301
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.570
I mean it was getting hot.
They look like from the nose down,

302
00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:29.940
they look like Clint Howard.
I don't know what it is.

303
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.650
There's something going on with that family.
You can't,

304
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:35.730
<v 1>yeah.</v>

305
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.990
<v 0>You know what it is,
is they still look ethnic.
They feel look at,
um,</v>

306
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.670
<v 1>yeah.</v>

307
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.750
<v 0>If you look at like,
like white people from like,</v>

308
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.570
like look at Joe Dimaggio,
you,
he's probably considered a good looking guy.

309
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.130
That guy is fucking deck.

310
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.260
I Dunno what happened once everybody got all mixed up like all the fucking Nash

311
00:17:57.261 --> 00:18:01.490
and I was getting mixed up like dino started streamlining the looks and people

312
00:18:01.491 --> 00:18:05.390
are way better looking now.
Don't you think then when you look back in the day,

313
00:18:05.391 --> 00:18:09.470
I mean Jesus Christ,
Babe Ruth every once in Lou Gehrig was a good looking guy.

314
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.140
You know what I mean?
But Babe Ruth that I was a mess.
Joe Dimaggio mess.

315
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.890
I guess they weren't all bad looking.
I don't know.

316
00:18:18.891 --> 00:18:20.840
I'm just saying when you look at the shit back then,

317
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.850
like an Italian guy looked a hundred percent fucking,
I don't,

318
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:26.551
you know something.

319
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:28.640
And when I went to Italy they were better look in the back then,

320
00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:32.420
I don't know what the fuck it was.
We allegedly had better food back then.

321
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.200
People were shorter.
I don't know what it was.

322
00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:38.720
Did you ever notice that when you look back and when you really look at those

323
00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:39.470
old pictures?

324
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.560
I love looking at old pictures and it's like that George Carlin bit,

325
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:43.790
when you look at an old picture and you're like,

326
00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:47.360
everybody in that picture is dead.
And for some reason in a morbid way,

327
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:50.960
it's like fascinating.
When I look at those old pictures,
I just,

328
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:54.440
that's what I think a God damn it.
There was some fucking ugly ass people,

329
00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:01.060
you know,
and you know,
it was a game changer was uh,
three things.
Polio,

330
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.890
vaccine,
penicillin and braces.

331
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.970
Those three fucking things could just hide so many fucking imperfections,

332
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.130
you know what I mean?
And once you get braces,
Jesus Christ,

333
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:21.270
if you just brush your fucking teeth in remotely,
keep yourself in shape.

334
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.680
You know,
you throw on some nice clothes.
People have no idea where you came from.

335
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.713
<v 1>You know,</v>

336
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.180
<v 0>back in the day,
people,
they saw it on your teeth,
told the whole fucking story.</v>

337
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:37.840
You just smile and be like,
hi,
I can,
I can see you're going to have tuberculosis.

338
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.580
You live in a damp Dag fucking apartment with no fucking windows.

339
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:45.310
You saw it in their fucking teeth,
right?
I don't know about it.
Heard.

340
00:19:45.311 --> 00:19:47.620
What's his face?
Jp Morgan had like Rosacea.

341
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.300
Is that how you say they're all over his face?
He was just all fucking angry.

342
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.150
Those old school rich guys,
you know,
he used to walk around with top hats,

343
00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:59.950
just like the penguin harm while walking down the street.
Um,

344
00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.310
is this a podcast every morning?
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm talking about?

345
00:20:03.311 --> 00:20:05.650
Let me,
let me do some advertising here and then I'll uh,

346
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.800
I'll get to more babbling here in a moment.

Hot Sauce.
A shameless fucking shameless.
She looks in,

348
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.550
bred her fucking teeth.
There's something going on with Tara on the sub.

349
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.340
Go with you.
See how Bill Clinton collapse now it's like he's a,

350
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.590
like a marionette puppet.
He has his mouth open.

351
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.250
That's how he made it.
But that smiling with his mouth open.
Oh,

352

I'm going to fix it.
I don't know.

They do set ups,

They do fucking,

They do all the upper body stuff and they walk around with their fucking chicken

358
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:01.390
legs.
But still you're always working on the outside of your body.

359
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:04.450
What about the inside man?
Well,

<v 0>I still don't get that.
I really don't.</v>

423
00:24:33.211 --> 00:24:36.420
I don't understand that that the fucking 40% of the tickets go on sold.

424
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.740
So like when the patriots,
everybody wants a Patriot's ticket's,

425
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:41.670
only 40% of those tickets go and sold.
I,

426
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.200
I really don't understand that part of it.
This is why I lose advertising.
Um,

427
00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:48.000

I still have two more.
We're not,
I can't do two.

458
00:26:34.681 --> 00:26:39.150
I'll do two more later.
Let's go back to here.
Um,
the fucking,

459
00:26:39.151 --> 00:26:42.900
how about the Saint Louis Blues?
Me in Saint Louis,

460
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.610
meet me yet the fair,
um,
I miss game three.

461
00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.690
I was convinced that a,
once they blew game to that,
that was fucking it.

462
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:58.150
Um,
but I was actually able to watch game four and um,

463
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.390
I worry when I turned,
I actually turned it on mid second,
mid second period.

464
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.140
And um,

465
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:06.750
<v 1>yeah,</v>

466
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.510
<v 0>I got to tell you that these are not your fucking dance.
St Louis Blues,</v>

467
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.870
you know,
they were down,
they came back,
they went ahead.
They just,

468
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.920
they just,
it's actually you're watching Chicago losing their composure.

469
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.150
Chicago trying to draw them into fights and stuff like that.
It's unbelievable.

470
00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:27.700
Now.
I'm not counting,
I kind of am cotton Chicago.

471
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.530
I don't think that they are going to come back from this one.

472
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.420
I think a St Louis Blues are a got their eye on the prize or whatever.

473
00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.510
I think they got the series and um,
just the way they're playing,

474
00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.490
just all the shit that they,

475
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.780
I've seen them go through all these years and never answered the bell and just

476
00:27:43.781 --> 00:27:48.280
fucking implode and lose the fucking series there.
This team does not do that.

477
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.980
And,
uh,
it's fucking great to see,

478
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.200
but it's also great watching the Blackhawks to like,
you know,

479
00:27:53.201 --> 00:27:56.290
what I love about them is you can see like their,
their,
um,

480
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.890
like Patrick King and you could just see the guy gives a fuck.

481
00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.940
That's the ego win one championship.
And that'd be like,
yeah,
you know,

482
00:28:03.941 --> 00:28:04.571
fucking whatever.

483
00:28:04.571 --> 00:28:08.740
But the guys who give a fuck and they want to win as many as they can,

484
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.420
he can't put a price on those guys.

485
00:28:10.421 --> 00:28:14.620
So as much as it's kind of bizarre watching Chicago being down three to one

486
00:28:14.621 --> 00:28:17.980
after this success over the last five,
six years,
um,

487
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.980
watching how much they give a fuck,
who is that?
And I mean,

488
00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:25.390
I'm so bad with the names down,
so out of the fucking loop,
who's the guy,
uh,
uh,

489
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.520
Patrick Sharp,
get fucking trade it.
Who was,

490
00:28:27.521 --> 00:28:30.360
the guy was fucking crosscheck and everybody at the end of the game and it was a

491
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.310
go the guys at dirty piece of shit.
It's like,
no,
he isn't.
He gives a fuck.

492
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.180
He gives a fuck,
you know,
going to the penalty box.

493
00:28:37.181 --> 00:28:41.650
He's fucking screaming at people dropping the F bomb.
I loved every second of it.

494
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.200
Um,
oh man.
You know,
you know what?

495
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.780
I shouldn't even say the Blackhawks arrived the keys.

496
00:28:46.781 --> 00:28:50.250
You know the fucking Black Hawks right now.
I like this no fucking way.

497
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.800
These guys are going to beat us next game.
You know that.

498
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:54.930
That's what they're saying.
Fuck this shit.

499
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.860
All we need to do is when this next one get it back into our building and then

500
00:28:58.861 --> 00:29:01.830
the pressure will be on them.
That all,
fuck if we don't,

501
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.130
we don't win this one then.
Now we're looking at a game seven.

502
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.300
That's how fucked up three to one is.
You always think like,

503
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:14.160
Oh man was sitting pretty and it's just like,
no,
we're not.
We're not.

504
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:16.770
We have to win this next game.
If we lose this next game,

505
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:21.060
then all of a sudden all of the fucking pressure is dumped on us for the next,

506
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:25.200
for the rest of the series.
Um,
it's,
I dunno,

507
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.430
it's fucking a,

508
00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.520
<v 1>okay.</v>

509
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.190
<v 0>I Dunno.
I actually believe it or not as bad as I am at math,</v>

510
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.760
like seven game series numbers like fascinate me.
Like if you go down,

511
00:29:34.761 --> 00:29:39.230
oh to like the Boston Celtics and it's this weird thing where if you just think

512
00:29:39.231 --> 00:29:42.430
look,
which is down two games to none,
it doesn't seem that bad.

513
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:43.510
A hole to crawl out of.

514
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:48.040
But when you do the math and be like we have to win four of the remaining five

515
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:52.630
games,
you're like what the fuck?
How the fuck do you do that?

516
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.630
And you know when I say the [inaudible] 86 mets,

517
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.600
cause I remember that we won the first two games in New York City and I was just

518
00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:05.080
like Oh my God,

519
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.010
all we got to do is when to one of the next four they got to win four out of the

520
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:12.310
next,
I'm sorry we got to win two out of the next five.

521
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

522
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.210
<v 0>That's all we had to do.
Oh,</v>

523
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.900
we had to deal with with two out of the next five to one four to five and they

524
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:19.933
fuck,

525
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.100
they came back and they won game three and four and Fenway,

526
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.560
if I remember this correctly,
the first two games wasn't a down there.

527
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.720
I don't,
I know what,
I can't remember that.

528
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.390
I just remember we won the first two games and I want to say they came here

529
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.780
and then what that would do if they were here.
Then we went down there,

530
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.280
don't game six and seven went down there.
Game six certainly was and seven was,

531
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.890
wait,
wait,
hold on.
A fuck.
Should go.
It goes home.
Home away.
Away.

532
00:30:56.510 --> 00:31:00.440
Oh my way home.
No,
maybe it was his three in a row in Boston.

533
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

534
00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.530
<v 0>Maybe it was three in a row and bottom.
They might've gone to three.
Two,</v>

535
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:06.643
<v 1>yeah.</v>

536
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.970
<v 0>Oh God.
What a shit show.
We won game five were like,</v>

537
00:31:08.971 --> 00:31:12.060
finally we had games six one we blew that and then we were up three.

538
00:31:12.061 --> 00:31:14.370
Nothing gave seminar.
It can be,
it can be all,
but just like fucking that.

539
00:31:14.371 --> 00:31:15.780
So I really shouldn't say this is over.

540
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.470
All I'm saying is you've got to watch game five and you watch how the fucking

541
00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:22.350
black hawks come up.
I know that they lost a lot of guys,

542
00:31:22.351 --> 00:31:23.610
but they still got tapes.

543
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.660
They still got a fucking dog a k days still God fuck.

544
00:31:27.661 --> 00:31:29.840
And the other guy and the other fucking guy,
right?

545
00:31:29.841 --> 00:31:34.610
You got enough guys left data like we're not losing this fucking game.
Um,

546
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.200
blues.
You know what is,
I think it's a must win.
You have to meet just saying,

547
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:44.050
this is how fucking wishy washy I am after I just say,

548
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:46.390
I think the blue got this one.
I'm,
I'm not thinking like,

549
00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:47.710
thank God they got to close your mouth.

550
00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.380
<v 1>Okay,</v>

551
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.670
<v 0>I got close.
My Jesus Christ,</v>

552
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:55.080
I hope in new Gingrich looking coach fucking gives them that speech.
Um,

553
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.820
speaking to which the Boston Celtics,
I'm calling it right now.

554
00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:03.750
Hot before you get to fucking excited.
I'm going Joe Willie name.
It's right now.

555
00:32:03.751 --> 00:32:08.610
I guarantee fucking t you the Boston Celtics.
You're going to go into the garden.

556
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.540
There's going to be all those championship banners hanging from the fucking

557
00:32:12.541 --> 00:32:13.950
rafters,
right?

558
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.860
All of a sudden you're not gonna have that cool breeze blowing over your head

559
00:32:16.861 --> 00:32:18.600
like you feel down in your Omni Center.

560
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:23.160
Whatever the fuck the hawks play right from your lack of goddamn championships

561
00:32:23.161 --> 00:32:27.420
down there.
Um,
the Boston Celtics,

562
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:32.460
I am me who doesn't play hoop?

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.590
The Boston Celtics are going to win game three.

566
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.860
If I don't understand why you have to wait till fucking Friday.

567
00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:45.930
I'm actually going to be on the road.
Were you going to be bill?

568
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.340
I'm going to be in Saint Louis,
the original home of the Atlanta Hawks,

569
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.110
the Saint Louis Hawks and who beat him in 1958 for the NBA Championship.

570
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.220
The Boston Celtics.
You like dead.

571
00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.850
The synergies all going to be there.

572
00:33:00.851 --> 00:33:04.750
They're going back to Boston where all those championship banners are.

573
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.600
Old Billy red face is going to be in Saint Louis,

574
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.930
the original home of the hearts where we beat them in 1958 and I'm telling you

575
00:33:10.931 --> 00:33:15.130
right now,
you take all your money,
you steal from your mother,

576
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.020
you put it on the Celtics,

577
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.620
and I guarantee you you're going to come away a winner.
And if you lose,

578
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.610
I don't want to hear you crying to me because I take no responsibility for this.

579
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.903
All right?

580
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.380
You're responsible for your own fucking actions are the most fucked up thought.

581
00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:33.620
<v 1>Okay,</v>

582
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.390
<v 0>I had the most fucking fucked up thought the other night and I,</v>

583
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.390
and you happen to have like a fucked up thought and then you did,

584
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:42.830
you go to Google it and you thinking like a bunch of people going to agree with

585
00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:46.430
you and then you're just like,
no,
you know what?
I'm just a fucking moron.

586
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.660
You know that postpartum depression,
you know,

587
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.630
women have a baby and then they just fucking have this unbelievable level of

588
00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:58.520
depression.
Um,
I whatever,
for whatever reason,

589
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.510
was hearing a story about it and I was listening and listening and I was

590
00:34:02.511 --> 00:34:06.380
thinking like,
you know what?
As much as that is a thing,

591
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.710
uh,
I bet 17%,
I dunno why it came to that number,
but in my head,

592
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:16.810
17% of women that get postpartum depression,
that just,

593
00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.260
that's what I was thinking.

594
00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.370
Like it's a real thing for 83% of them,

595
00:34:24.371 --> 00:34:29.371
but 17% of them are just mad now that they have a kid and they can't go out and

596
00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:31.960
go do Jello shots whenever they want to.

597
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.420
And then it just being a bunch of fucking babies about it.

598
00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.650
That's what old not doctor [inaudible] was thinking.

599
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:44.100
And then I looked it up and there was all this fucking shit about dumb men like

600
00:34:44.591 --> 00:34:46.150
me that thinks shit like that.

601
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:52.170
So you know what's great is I only thought that thought for about three minutes

602
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.780
and then I went and looked it up and I was like,
oh,
all right,
I'm a moron,

603
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.680
I'm a moron.
I wonder if there's any male,

604
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:04.150
if there's male male,
can males have that shit?

605
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.390
Don't even bother doing studies.
They don't give a fuck about us.
They just,

606
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.230
we don't,
we die eight years before women on average,
and they,

607
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:17.590
nobody really cares.
They,
why does this keep happening?
They don't give a fuck.

608
00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:20.740
Yeah.
It's a guy.
I'll make another one.
All right.
Um,

609
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:25.220
male post partum.
Oh my God.
There is this

610
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.710
facts about men depression.
Oh,

611
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:31.850
give me a fucking break.

612
00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:34.400
You didn't go through and he's fucking sort of physical thing.

613
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.050
The kid has guys who want to the game anymore.
Um,

614
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.170
men's depression research is only beginning to understand men's unique

615
00:35:44.171 --> 00:35:47.620
experiences of depression.
Yeah.
You,
why?
Why do you think that is?

616
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:53.220
Because we're told to shut the fuck up and plow through it.
Uh,
blah,

617
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:57.730
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Research is lagging even further as for PP and d,

618
00:35:57.731 --> 00:36:01.840
whatever that is.
I don't know what that is.

619
00:36:01.841 --> 00:36:06.370
Postpartum Notre Dame,
I don't have no idea.
Um,
in terms of depression in general,

620
00:36:06.371 --> 00:36:07.204
if you're a man,

621
00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:11.590
you're more likely than a woman to try and hide your depression or to withdraw

622
00:36:11.591 --> 00:36:15.220
from others.
This only worsens your system.
Oh,

623
00:36:15.221 --> 00:36:18.040
paternal posts post natal depression.

624
00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.240
Oh my God,
you should see the pictures of these fucking people.

625
00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.290
This guy's sitting there.
He's,
he's clearly an actor and he's just looking down.

626
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:31.060
Holding is like pinching his nose between his eyes.
Okay.

627
00:36:31.061 --> 00:36:35.020
In this picture we want you to look depressed.
All right?
You know that statue?

628
00:36:35.021 --> 00:36:38.260
The thinker.
Okay.
I want you to do the same pose,

629
00:36:38.261 --> 00:36:41.830
but don't think I want you to pinch the top of your nose.
That's it.
That's it.

630
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.540
Close your eyes.
Think of something painful and all right,

631
00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:48.640
that's it.
Here's 50 bucks.
Go get you something to donuts.

632
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:54.100
Classic symptoms of depression.
Depressed,
sad mood.
All right,
let's,

633
00:36:54.101 --> 00:36:57.730
I'm going to take this test.
Uh,
depressed,
sad mood.

634
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.090
Ah,
no,
I don't have that.

635
00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.130
Loss of interest or pleasure.
I don't have that either.
Significant ways.

636
00:37:06.131 --> 00:37:10.060
Loss or gain.
Fuck,
I'm putting on weight.
I have this shit.

637
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.020
Trouble sleeping and oversleeping.
Oh No,
I thought it was the booze.

638
00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.300
Restless feeling and inability to sit still or slow down.

639
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.170
Yeah,
I definitely got that fatigue.
Loss of energy.
Tower tired all the time.

640
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.540
Absolutely.
I thought that was,
cause I drink every night.

641
00:37:25.541 --> 00:37:26.710
And you only get four hours sleep,

642
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:32.070
worthless or guilty feelings check a impaired concentration at difficulty making

643
00:37:32.771 --> 00:37:35.350
decisions.
I got half of that.

644
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.340
Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.
Yep.

645
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:45.010
Um,
suicide options is always right there,

646
00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:50.050
right?
It's such an easy one.
You dislike,
you know,
or I could just kill myself.

647
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:55.180
No,
but then you know what if,
uh,
what of the Bruins rebuild it.
I miss it.

648
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.440
You know what I think I'll stick around.
Um,

All right.
And you know what,

709
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:41.770
that's the first half of the podcast here.
And,
uh,

710
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.680
I want to thank all the African Americans who are listening to this and I want

711
00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:48.470
you to know that,
um,
you know,

712
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:52.550
my favorite guilty pleasure is soul food.
Uh,

713
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.130
Eddie Asians listening.
Um,

714
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:01.820
I don't know.
I uh,
I really respect mixed martial arts.

715
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.650
Good.
Try to appeal to everybody.
Germans,

716
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:11.710
I don't hold you responsible for why you picked one bad guy.

717
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.620
You know,
you had a bad fucking couple of years.

718
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:20.450
All of a sudden the wrong guy got in there.
You,
it happens eventually.

719
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.980
It happens to every country.
I mean,
I think at this point,

720
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.570
hasn't there been a mass murdering maniac?
I'm,
you know,

721
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.970
haven't the Germans made enough unbelievable sports,
sedans,
Porsche's,

722
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.450
you know?
No,
you don't think so.

723
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.550
They got nice clothes,
so don't they?
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,

724
00:42:40.551 --> 00:42:43.730
I don't know what to do.
Thank you.
Jeremy.
I you guys during the World Cup.

725
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.150
How about that?
It's just funny that I like listening.

726
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:52.040
If there's something funny to me of a bunch of Germans in public,

727
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.550
in a stadium,
you know,
singing along and shit that no,

728
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:58.090
there's no way that's never not going to be creepy anymore.

729
00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.660
So there's just something hilarious about it.

730
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:03.380
So I always root for you guys to get to the later rounds,
you know?

731
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.180
And as you like when Germany,
whatever they're playing like Brazil,

732
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.300
it's impossible to not pictured the ghost of fucking Adolf Hitler's sitting up

733
00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:18.821
there hoping for a do over Jesse Owens embarrassed them and you know,

734
00:43:20.171 --> 00:43:24.680
you think he's not up there best two out of three.
Um,

735
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:25.603
right.

736
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.140
Please enjoy this music and we're going to start blogging and play some greatest

737
00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:33.030
hits from a Monday morning podcast gone.
Bye.
Thank you everybody.

738
00:43:33.031 --> 00:43:35.950
You have a great weekend,
your cuts.
And uh,
once again,

739
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.320
thank you to everybody who's been watching.
F is for family.

740
00:43:38.321 --> 00:43:39.760
We are having a great time writing these things.

741
00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:43.990
And last night we had a great event with Netflix.
Netflix.

742
00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.250
Keep it weird.
They did this thing.
They hijack that hippy fucking thing.
Yeah,

743
00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:50.890
they're corporation.
You know what I mean?
They do want to.
Hillary Clinton does.

744
00:43:50.891 --> 00:43:55.030
You know what's the one thing you have on you at all times?
Netflix.
Oh,

745
00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:58.960
I always have a bag of weed and my purse,
man,
everybody's running for office.

746
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.840
All right,
that's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
I've talked to you on Monday.

747
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.670
<v 3>Hello.
What's going on Monday morning.</v>

748
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:55.310
<v 4>And as she can tell by the sound of my voice,
uh,</v>

749
00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:01.440
I got about two hours sleep less last night I was sitting in the continental

750
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:06.790
terminal in Newark Airport.
I just had an Omelet,

751
00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:13.690
fucking three cheese and a got damn piece of toast and a,

752
00:45:13.691 --> 00:45:16.810
I was trying not to get mad at the guy making the fucking ex,

753
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.610
but I did order toast with it,
you know?
And uh,

754
00:45:21.611 --> 00:45:23.200
I don't know if this has been your experience,

755
00:45:23.201 --> 00:45:26.650
but my experience is when I go into a breakfast establishment,

756
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.380
every time you order something,
hang on a second.

757
00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.620
Okay?
Yeah.
Got It.
Got It.
Got It.
Got It.
Got It.

758
00:45:38.621 --> 00:45:43.140
I got it out of that.
We know,
we know.
We know we have to get on the airplane.

759
00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:48.460
Got Up
please.

760
00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.960
All old people.
Do we have a lamp and get on first?
We know how it works.

761
00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.300
Shut up.
Okay.
Anyway,
so when I order,
uh,

762
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:04.330
anytime I go out to breakfast place right now,
I ordered toast.

763
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.860
He gotta get toast with your eggs.
You know,
you're a fucking communist.
Okay.

764
00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.300
Perfect sense fucking reason.

765
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:14.920
They always make the goddamn x first and then they go,
oh shit,

766
00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.970
I didn't make the toast.

767
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:21.160
So then either they give you the eggs and you eat the fucking eggs without the

768
00:46:21.161 --> 00:46:21.994
toast,

769
00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:26.820
which once again is unamerican eat the toast with the fucking ax.

770
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:29.200
It's supposed to arrive at the same time.
Okay,

771
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:32.590
so you did just give you the goddamn eggs and he can fucking eggs.

772
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:35.950
And then they go,
oh,
by the way,
he or she tells,
you know,

773
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:38.980
have you ever give you ordered like a hot fudge Sundae and it gave you the

774
00:46:38.981 --> 00:46:41.800
fucking ice cream.
And then once your daddy get me ice cream,

775
00:46:41.801 --> 00:46:45.160
then they came over with the,
with the fuck,
but they could shout out a hot fudge.

776
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.960
You know,
when you hold your nose,

777
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.330
you get to fucking throw it down like Yeager muster,
you know?

778
00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:54.040
So this fucking Douche bag makes the goddamn eggs.
All right.

779
00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.120
And then realize,
oh,
you white toast with that.
Yeah,
he had toast with that.

780
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.720
Do you read the next line on the fucking order slip?
You would've seen it.

781
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.400
You know,
it's not like it's,
it's,
it's a lot of reading.
It's not war and peace.

782
00:47:06.401 --> 00:47:11.260
It says three cheese omelets and underneath it it said white toast.
Right.

783
00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.610
So what,
what does this guy do?
He ops it,
keep the fucking eggs

784
00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.140
with him while he waits for the toast to be done and he's making some sort of

785
00:47:22.541 --> 00:47:27.430
Turkey sandwich.
And a needless to say,
I get,
I get the egg.

786
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.450
Oh,
it's just loud.
Fucking going to be screaming at her cell phone near me.

787
00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:36.790
You know,
I tried to pick up fucking part of the airport where no one would come.

788
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.610
Okay.
She got on a tracks,
it got 11 old person and attracts,

789
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.350
um,
you know what I mean?
What are they doing?

790
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.840
Are we union up in 1940 Olympics?
Uh,
anyways,
yes.

791
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:55.120
That's what this fucking guy does,
right?
He gives me my
long story short,

792
00:47:55.121 --> 00:47:58.990
I get my eggs,
my eggs are fucking cold and now my post is as hot as hell.

793
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.090
And uh,
you know,
that's an element,
you know what I mean?

794
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:07.780
Goddamn home and the pilot fucking days going to go.
You know,

795
00:48:07.781 --> 00:48:10.390
when you can't get your breakfast to coincide on a temperature,

796
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.350
it's just really annoying.
Um,

797
00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:17.750
<v 5>but you know,
Jesus Christ,</v>

798
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:30.510
what is he even saying?
Amazing

799
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.290
<v 4>to people with really foreign sounding names.</v>

800
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.530
She said that last name too is if there's another guy named Barack Obama and the

801
00:48:39.531 --> 00:48:44.220
fucking airport,
um,
oof.
Jesus.
I'm going to move it.

802
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:50.390
Oh God.
It's not a special announcement when you have an announcement every three

803
00:48:50.391 --> 00:48:54.710
seconds.
Oh,
should I keep my bag with me?
Oh,

804
00:48:54.711 --> 00:48:56.570
I was going to leave it down the fucking street.

805
00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:02.840
You cannot take a pistol onto the plane.
Even if you're in first class.

806
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:05.300
What?

807
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:10.280
I can't stand these fucking announcements like some God damn child can be five

808
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:15.010
seconds telling me what I can and can't do.
Just tell me what I can't do it.

809
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:15.844
That's what I don't like.

810
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.030
That little hot Stuart are sitting over there playing Sodoku.

811
00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.640
I'm trying to attract a man.
Show the cheese,
the classy flight attendant.

812
00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:30.140
She's not a Sky Horn and she's in the puzzle copy mean she doesn't drink.

813
00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:35.210
But you'd be surprised.
I bet she gives a good blow job.
Oh look at me.

814
00:49:35.211 --> 00:49:37.850
Give you a little sex joke.
I just stay away from that material

815
00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.540
cause it's so easy to get a laugh.

816
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.980
I get chuckling in your cubicle right now people.
Um,
all right.

817
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:50.450
Your collective cubicle.
Anyways,
that's my fucking three cheese on with,

818
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:51.640
with the,
uh,

819
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:56.570
delayed white toast story slash Tourette's over the fucking announcements.

820
00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.450
Um,
if you do it on my page,

821
00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.140
this is the Monday morning podcast hosted by me.

822
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:06.430
Next week I'll have a guest house,
I'll be sick and uh,

823
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.600
some feature I call up his myself and he'll complain about the bay.
Oh,
he bought.

824
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.190
Um,
so anyways,
I do one of these every week.
I uh,

825
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:18.680
answer questions and I uh,
you know,

826
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:22.670
people send me questions and Oh,
speaking of that,
um,

827
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:26.540
I want to apologize to the person that I trashed last week for asking me where

828
00:50:26.541 --> 00:50:29.840
exactly they send the questions to.

829
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.370
Evidently somebody hacked my account and got rid of the place where it says add

830
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:35.660
friends,
send a message.

831
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:39.770
So I imagine that would be confusing even though he did still send me an email,

832
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:44.540
but I want to thank uh,
the two or three people gave me the heads up.
Um,

833
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:49.130
I'm trying to think who the fuck would hack my account so I couldn't add

834
00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:53.870
friends.
Um,
shortlist would probably be other comedians.

835
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.360
Uh Oh hang on a second.

836
00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.680
Hang down while I thought that now they,

837
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.710
they're telling the agent people what they can and can't do when they get on
the,

838
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.410
on the flight.
Uh,

839
00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.320
no shop in chopstick allowed in the common area.

840
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:14.480
Um,
you know,
there was not only racist,
it was also hacky chopsticks bill.

841
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:19.481
You couldn't come up with a more original fucking artifact from the Orient.

842
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:25.490
You know what,
I can't,
I'm actually at a loss.
We had chopsticks these,
these,

843
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:30.050
these,
these are the hacky references I have from the Far East chopsticks,
Sushi,

844
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.940
which are kind of the same thing.
They go hand in hand,
a Kabuki.

845
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:40.760
Um,
and then that one guy who stood in front of that tank at Tiananmen Square,

846
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.730
um,
oh,

847
00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:48.750
Buddhist monks protesting whatever the fuck it is giant is doing to them.

848
00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.040
You know what China is doing to,
uh,
to back.

849
00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:53.860
They're doing the same thing with these fucking people in the year we afforded

850
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.860
doing over the announcements.
That's what it's like living at the bet.

851
00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:02.290
Constant announcements over your head.
They no plane,

852
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.820
no Tibet monk,

853
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:08.360
no Gregorian chant from 1230 to one 30.

854
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:13.310
All right.
Was that a sense of enough?
I hope so.
Okay.
Uh,
anyway,
so people send me,

855
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:14.510
uh,
whatever.

856
00:52:14.511 --> 00:52:17.840
They send me questions and I answered them to the best of my ability.

857
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.080
People send me conspiracy theory.
Uh,

858
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.000
somebody sent me a great link,

859
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.660
but I'm sitting here in the airport and I can't open that shit without having to

860
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:30.110
pay for fucking Internet,
which is I refuse to do,
cause I'm already doing it.

861
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:36.660
I'm already doing it on my Goddamn fucking place out in California,

862
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.630
but whoever it was at,
send me that thing.

863
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:40.060
I really wish I could stay in and do that.

864
00:52:40.061 --> 00:52:44.510
That that conspiracy theory thing was hilarious and all this stuff about nine 11

865
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.720
Hitler.
And,
uh,

866
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.120
what I loved about it was the usual,

867
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.510
the usual categories of conspiracy theory.

868
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:58.370
But somehow everything came back to blaming Jewish people,

869
00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:03.410
literally to the point that this website was actually trying to suggest that you

870
00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:08.411
wish people were actually financially backing Hitler and his whole movement.

871
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.960
I mean,
I dunno.
It was just fucking,
it was hilarious.

872
00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.870
There's about shit,
another announcement.

873
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:24.320
How do people get locked in the airport?
You know what I mean?

874
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.350
How do you get separated?
Like,

875
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.110
this place is on fire and everybody's fucking running.
Everybody has cell phones.

876
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:36.140
I don't understand the need to still paid somebody tangent into [inaudible] and

877
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:42.040
Philip Rivers and who the fuck is,
oh,

878
00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:43.900
he's the quarterback for fucking San Diego.
I forget.

879
00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:47.620
I can't even come up with a fake name.
I said Philips second.

880
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.410
That was a good fake name.
And then I panicked.

881
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:55.140
I don't want to rivers rivers see a hotheaded quarterback.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.

882
00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:57.810
That's not the hot headed quarterback.
That's his.
Uh,

883
00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.140
that's the braggadocious one.
Who was the original?

884
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:04.470
Who's that fucking quarterback for?

885
00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:09.450
The charges were screaming at that reporter.
Fuck was his name.

886
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:14.180
Number one draft.
Ryan Leaf.
We taste so many.

887
00:54:14.181 --> 00:54:18.380
You brought up there who listened to this podcast and you're not into,
uh,

888
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:23.040
sports.
You still should go on Google,
Google,
Ryan Leaf,

889
00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:27.570
r y a n l e a f.
Oh wait,
Google it.

890
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.710
And uh,
you know,
if you thought your husband was an asshole and I had a chance,

891
00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.450
you know,
and sort of would berate you.

892
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:37.230
You got to see when he yells at this report,
it's awesome.

893
00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:41.880
No one gave off the date rape but better than Ryan Leaf.
Um,

894
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:46.690
one of the great characters,
one of the great busts in NFL history.

895
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:51.450
Anybody else moves?
Tony Mander rich set his fucking name.

896
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.130
Who's The guy being credible?
Woke up at 400 pound guy on roids.

897
00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.360
The packers picked up,

898
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:01.900
he showed up with his muscles and his acne and uh,

899
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.240
I dunno what happened next and ran,

900
00:55:05.241 --> 00:55:07.290
they gave him an uppercut and just ended his career.

901
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:10.740
I don't really never really did shit.
Oh wait.
Oh,
okay.

902
00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.290
Todd Marinovich.
That's the other guy.

903
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:18.290
That's the guy thought I confused it with the guy from USC who's dad was making

904
00:55:18.821 --> 00:55:23.410
a run for forties.
As a toddler.
I was at least timing them in the 40.
Um,

905
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.650
I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about this point.
I'm gonna have to sleep.
Um,

906
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:31.200
so anyways,
let's get on with the podcast questions.
Oh,
but before I do,

907
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:35.700
I'm fans of my radio show that I do with that Joe to Rosa,

908
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:40.920
um,
who's in my top,
uh,
46 on my space.
If you look,

909
00:55:40.921 --> 00:55:44.970
he's the second one over.
Uh,
we do a radio show on Xm two o two once a month.

910
00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:49.290
It comes out on a Saturday.
The next one we have is going to be on Saturday,

911
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:53.760
may the 24th.
We just prerecorded it.
Uh,
we had a great show.

912
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.380
Me and Joe both have incredible tempers and we scream at each other and that's

913
00:55:58.381 --> 00:56:01.380
the show.
And uh,
actually the show is a guest.

914
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:06.330
We had an anger management therapist come on to analyze our anger and try to

915
00:56:06.331 --> 00:56:09.150
figure out why were a couple of psychos.
And uh,
I got to met Nan.

916
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:12.660
She got right around by defenses.
She got in real close.

917
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:17.010
She was like right in my grill emotionally.
And uh,
it was fucking uncomfortable,

918
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:21.150
but I think it may for some good radio.
Um,
so please check that out.

919
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:23.350
And uh,
what else?

920
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:28.380
I'm going to be at a xannies in Chicago on May 14th through that Sunday.

921
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.100
I think I don't have my calendar in front of me.
This is gonna be real sketchy.

922
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:37.750
Um,
but the date should be right there.
You can click on it and uh,

923
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:41.140
find out where I'm going to be case you don't understand how fucking computers

924
00:56:41.141 --> 00:56:43.750
work.
All right.
What else?

925
00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:48.160
I got out Caroline Caroline's comedy club in,
uh,
New York City.

926
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:53.220
I'm gonna be there from May 29th to June 1st and Joe Rosa we'll be featuring and

927
00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:58.450
uh,
in June I'm going to be in a,
the fucking,

928
00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.840
my good night's comedy clubs,
Raleigh,
North Carolina,

929
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.080
and I'll be at the punchline in Atlanta,
Georgia,

930
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:09.380
Atlanta as the brothers calling.
Um,

931
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.820
when the hell am I going to be there?

932
00:57:12.821 --> 00:57:15.040
Something like fucking June 19th or something.
I Dunno,

933
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.520
I don't have the stuff in front of me.
Okay.
All right.

934
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:21.220
I'm in a bad mood or rite aid.
Cold eggs and fucking hot toast.

935
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.520
It's enough to make anybody in fucking irritable.
Um,
God,

936
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:28.170
I can't wait to get old and dress like dad.

937
00:57:28.171 --> 00:57:33.171
Look at this fucking mess set on a pink Hoodie with lime green slacks,

938
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:38.700
Capri slacks that cover all the varicose veins down who calves and no socks and

939
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:46.070
then some sort of Michael Jackson loafers,
southern guy.

940
00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.810
He looks like
the guy would say he murdered his wife.

941
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:53.170
You know,
he's probably got a bottle of peroxide even though,

942
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:54.020
so I'm able to be murders.

943
00:57:54.021 --> 00:57:56.650
Said why if there was go with the peroxide then I talked about that last week.

944
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:58.031
You know what I mean?

945
00:57:58.031 --> 00:58:02.350
Like that's going to help you fucking London lady over here with a pants suit.

946
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:07.590
You know,
I should talk right now I have on tracks sneakers,
track snickers.

947
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.450
Is that actually a fucking brand of sneakers?
I don't know what it is.

948
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.930
They're Russ silver with a red Nike swoosh.

949
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:18.910
It was probably sewn on by a fucking three year old in Bangladesh.
And,
uh,

950
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.620
I have on jeans and a suede leather coat.

951
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.520
Um,
yeah,
I guess I'm looking like an asshole to her,

952
00:58:27.521 --> 00:58:30.160
but they have another person sitting here some up and coming comedian doing a

953
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:31.870
podcast and then actually making fun of me.

954
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:35.440
I want to do that fucking area and look inside.
Go over there.

955
00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:40.060
Why would you wear a fucking suede jacket with some tracks?
Sneakers,

956
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:44.710
unless you stole the jacket and you had to get the fuck out of there quickly,

957
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:48.460
but enough about theories.
All right,
let's get it home with the,
uh,

958
00:58:48.461 --> 00:58:52.780
the podcast questions of the week.
Um,
okay.
Bill,

959
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.020
you said you love shit that is not meant to be funny,

960
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.950
but you find it to be that way.
Uh,

961
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:04.980
we try to read that sentence in a pace that will actually make sense and it

962
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:08.170
really awkward pauses in it.
You know what I mean?
Like if you,

963
00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:12.250
if you take the most basic sentence and you pause in a weird area,

964
00:59:12.251 --> 00:59:14.200
people don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.

965
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:19.230
And I think I just started to read it at an even tempo one t won't.

966
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:23.020
All right,
Bill,
you said,

967
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:26.330
you said you love shit that is not meant to be funny,

968
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:31.220
but you find it to be that way.
Say now it makes sense.
It made sense to me.

969
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:34.490
I got lost the first time I ran it.
Just why not read?

970
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:39.080
Cause I just get confused and it just really holds a mirror up to my stupidity

971
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:43.940
and if I'm alone,
it's a very scary moment.
Um,
okay.

972
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.750
So what is your favorite movie that you find funny that is not meant to be
funny?

973
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:52.370
Um,
there's so much shit I can't even start.
You know what?

974
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:54.500
This is really the little stewardess haven over here.

975
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:57.410
Now there's three stewardesses sitting there.

976
00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.470
This looks like the beginning of a porno.
You know,

977
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.860
like all I need to do is just walk into frame and next thing you know what's

978
01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:06.470
going to be on baby.
Um,
okay.

979
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:10.120
What is my favorite movie that I find funny that's not meant to be funny.
Um,

980
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.600
there's too many of them.
You know,
roadhouse.
He never seen row house.

981
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:19.670
Some of you youngsters out there,
you got to see stars.
Patrick Swayze,
I believe.

982
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:22.240
That's why I have his picture there.
Um,

983
01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:27.420
roadhouse is basically about a boss.

984
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.490
Fuck my cell phone's going to die,
get damaged.
Let me get quickly here.

985
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:36.910
Roadhouses about a rough and tumble bar and they can't seem to get a control

986
01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:41.930
over it.
So they hire this bouncer from,

987
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.860
I don't know where,

988
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:47.180
but he basically has a reputation on the bouncer circuit.

989
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:48.560
That's what I love about it.

990
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:52.700
Like there's this bounce their circuit like Comedians,
you know what I mean?

991
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:54.860
Like people are out there like going,

992
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:59.690
Oh did you hear Chris Rock's new hour and 45 like there's like the Chris rock of

993
01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:03.620
bouncers out there,
you know like who's your favorite bouncer?

994
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.670
Like up and coming bouncers have a favorite fucking bouncer.

995
01:01:06.671 --> 01:01:09.860
It's money where they bring in,
they bring in Patrick Swayze,

996
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:14.861
all 138 pounds of him with his feathered mullet to come in and clean this

997
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.700
fucking bar up.

998
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.930
And two of my favorite scenes in there is when after he gets hired,

999
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:25.420
he gets into his Mercedes Benz and they're playing this music and then,
and then,

1000
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:29.700
and the show him,
I can put it on the ray ban glasses,
it's horse shit.

1001
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.880
And at one point he slide the cassette tape.

1002
01:01:31.881 --> 01:01:34.520
It like that with some fucking amazing,

1003
01:01:34.521 --> 01:01:37.400
I guess it was an amazing option at that point.
And uh,

1004
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.180
there's that moment and the moment when he leans against the bar and this really

1005
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:45.860
bad white blues music is playing and he's doing this weird sort of fucking head

1006
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:50.570
nod to the music that's supposed to imply that he's tough.
Um,
I dunno,

1007
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.020
my cell phone's going to die,
can't explain it,
but a Roadhouse,

1008
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:57.610
any movie that has Clint Howard in it.
And uh,

1009
01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.370
I signed Fox News to be fucking absolutely hilarious.

1010
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.570
Just the fact that people actually look at it like it's an actual news and these

1011
01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:08.870
people are journalists and uh,
and you know,

1012
01:02:08.871 --> 01:02:11.970
Bill O'reilly's always fucking hilarious screaming at people if the,

1013
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:14.510
and then just making over the top comments.

1014
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.440
Like the Second Amendment is the most important amendment out there,

1015
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:22.990
the right to bear arms.
If anything taught us that it was hurricane Katrina.

1016
01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:27.910
He actually fucking said that.

1017
01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:32.740
And then a nice drum and then started talking about who against the kind of

1018
01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:37.200
cover his tracks.
But he got the message out there.
All right,

1019
01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:41.620
let me answer this next question really quickly before my cell phone down.
Uh,

1020
01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.640
I was wondering if you're into comic books or how you fucking whore.

1021
01:02:45.641 --> 01:02:49.860
Nobody cares.
Your announcement.
Jeez.

1022
01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.370
And Shit on the concourse.

1023
01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.550
Why don't you repeat it a third time?
All right.
Uh,

1024
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.060
I was wondering if you were in comic books and if you were at all,
uh,
blah,
blah,

1025
01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:04.720
blah,
blah,
blah.
Who are your favorite ones?

1026
01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.840
I was in the Spiderman and um,
there was actually one of my favorite comic,

1027
01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:14.460
which is a kid who was a comic book with Spiderman and this guy powerment uh,

1028
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.020
this black guy,
this black superhero.

1029
01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:20.890
And he had this yellow shirt,
you know,

1030
01:03:20.891 --> 01:03:25.000
they always dress very flamboyantly and somehow there was a fire in a building

1031
01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:28.810
and he saved the fire,
the firemen.
So it was just a really cool one.

1032
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:33.870
And quite like the movies they make about a comics and it's,

1033
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.410
no,
I don't because most of them ended up being a chick flicks.

1034
01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:40.300
You know what?

1035
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.360
You should ask that question to Keith Robinson cause he's the one who really

1036
01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.530
fucking called,
uh,
it's not special.

1037
01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:53.180
Not a special announcement.
Every five fucking seconds.
Uh,

1038
01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:58.870
no one's going to abandon their luggage.
Okay.
All right.

1039
01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:02.610
It's time to wrap this fucking podcast up.
All right,

1040
01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:05.320
I'm going to go over there and go hit on these stewardesses and see if I can

1041
01:04:05.321 --> 01:04:09.400
make that fantasy come true.
Can even hear me.
