00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.680
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:06.090
It's the Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:09.660
Sorry for the fucking March 2nd I got to tell you something.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.770
Oh,
I'm coming out of the gate this week people.
I just fucking,

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.400
I just did like eight minutes.
A great fucking eight minutes.

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.710
A great fucking riff.
The whole God damn thing.

7
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.790
And then I looked down in the fucking God damn stupid ass fucking thing isn't

8
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:24.624
even on.

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.030
You know why this is the exact same fucking device I had the Olympus ls 10 now

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:35.031
it's the Olympus 14 and wouldn't you fucking know they couldn't just leave well

11
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:36.324
enough alone.

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.920
They got to add like 20 fucking steps and some stupid broads fucking voice in

13
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.930
there telling me what I know I'm doing.

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.860
So I fucking riff for like eight fucking minutes and I find out the thing is

15
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.570
even fucking recording.
I fucking,
I hate technology.

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.830
Okay.
I absolutely,
if I don't understand,
why do we keep going forward?

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.110
All right,
we got enough shit.

18
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.170
This is as comfortable as it's going to fucking get one.

19
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.870
Can we just have the shit and this is how it fucking works.

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680
And when you figure something out that's,
you know how it fucking works.

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.970
Jesus fucking Christ.

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.990
I told you guys and I fucking will never stop bitching about these things.

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.120
I fucking,
uh,
was talking on my podcast saying how,
you know,

24
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:24.020
I needed a new pair of fucking headphones one week,
right?
So,
uh,

25
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.600
some fucking personal listens to the podcast.

26
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.260
Ended up sending me a pair of fucking wireless fucking headphones,

27
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.850
wireless fucking headphones.

28
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.280
And I gotta tell you I've never had no fucking problems with something in my

29
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.990
life.
You fucking sitting there my whole life headphones fucking work.

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.380
You plug them into something that's charged the headphones.

31
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.860
Now the amount of fucking times I sat there with my phone listening to fucking

32
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:46.694
music,

33
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.540
my phone is charged and then the headphones went out and I couldn't listen.

34
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:53.180
It's just fucking,
why did you add that step?

35
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.780
Electronic Pencil sharpeners and all that shit.

36
00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:59.300
And now it's just something that's going to fucking,
that drives me up.

37
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.400
The other one,
the other pencil sharpener.

38
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.370
You could buy a pencil sharpener once and you'll,

39
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.800
you're gonna have to think of 100 fucking years and little kids could walk up

40
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:11.450
your eyes with yesterday.
She was my grandfather's,
well he used to,
you know,

41
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:14.630
fucking sharpened pencils and then,
and when he built stuff,

42
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.230
when we still had good warden,
this country,
right.

43
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.440
It wasn't all wet because it was brand new fucking trees.
It was old shit.

44
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.220
Oh my God,
I was in such a great fucking mood.

45
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.690
It's completely changed the whole fucking vibe of this God damn thing.
Anyways,

46
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.860
let me relax.
Calm down.
Let me try to get back to where I was.

47
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:37.720
I was in such a fucking great mood cause I'm back out here in Los [inaudible]

48
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.970
Congolese.
We make sure this thing's recording.

49
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.100
Let me make sure everything's okay.
And the Goddamn nerve center here,
you know,

50
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.810
fuck.
Anyways,
I'm back out here in la.

51
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.590
It's so fucking awesome cause I was just in New York City,
right?
I uh,

52
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.930
I flew back there and I did night at too many fucking,

53
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.860
and I gotta tell you that show lives up to its name.

54
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.790
I was standing backstage in the green room and I couldn't believe how many

55
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.860
people fucking came back there.
Jon Bon Jovi,

56
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.210
Steve Will Shemi,
Chris Rock,
Louis C,

57
00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:20.020
K on and on and on and on and on.

58
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.260
<v 0>I think one of the guys with the long hair,</v>

60
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.510
I think he might've been the keyboard player for Bon Jovi.

61
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.980
I don't know who the fuck he was was amazing.
Right?

62
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.520
I have my autograph book out.
No Kid.
Anyways,
uh,

63
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.610
will forte.
I got to uh,
got to talk to him and uh,

64
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.870
you know that guys,
one of my favorites.
And last night I actually watched his,
uh,

65
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.650
his new show last man on earth and it's so fucking funny.

66
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.480
It's just a Goddamn it,
I said such nice things on at the last fucking time,

67
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:52.780
you know,

68
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.260
now I'm just trying to remember what the fuck I said because of this stupid ass

69
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:59.410
fucking record.
And let me just fucking just speak from the heart here.

70
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.970
Like that guy is so fucking original.
Any,
he commits so hard to everything.

71
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:08.890
He does have such a fucking huge fan of his.
And,
uh,

72
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.990
I talked to him briefly backstage.
I'm going to try to get him on the podcast.

73
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:16.440
I just want to find out how the fuck he got something this original on a major

74
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:19.590
network.
They usually freak the fuck out.

75
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.430
Like they always say they want to do something new.
You know,

76
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:25.530
they always say they want to do something new,
but in the end,
you know,

77
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.280
they fucking cut it down and everybody gives him shit.
But I get it.

78
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.190
I get it.
You know what I mean?

79
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.190
Everybody's brave with somebody else's fucking money.

80
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.440
But when it's your money and your job on the line,

81
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:40.680
you're going to go with what has worked in the past.
I'm sorry,

82
00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:45.330
my voice is still cracking so I get what the fuck they do.
You know what I mean?

83
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.411
I got the,

84
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.590
I got this whole new bit that I'm going to be doing about fatties and fucking

85
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:53.220
ugly people who are bitch,
Moan and complain that beautiful people are in movies.

86
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.320
It's like,
yeah,
you know what?

87
00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:58.440
Why don't you go put your fucking million dollars up and go put some troll up

88
00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:01.170
there.
Let me give me a fucking break.
It's what it is.

89
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.950
Do you think I sit here wondering why is a balding redheaded male?

90
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.120
I'm not a fucking love interest in a movie.
I don't.
I get it.
You know why?

91
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.330
Because of WHO's my fucking zillion dollars,
I wouldn't cast me either.

92
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.940
Everybody fucking bitch moaning and complaining.

93
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.000
Get on a treadmill and shut the fuck up.
All right.

94
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.760
We're all out there eating salad.
You think we want to do it?
We don't.

95
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.490
It's part of the fucking business.
You know?

96
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.970
Why don't they just slow down the fucking NBA and glow or the rim so he can play

97
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.960
in that toe.
Fucking unreal.
Anyways,
let me plow ahead here.

98
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.910
Oh,
that's going to be a fun chunk of material I got.
I got,
oh Jesus Christ.

99
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.590
I got to vent on that one tonight.
I'm going up.
I'm fucking talking about that.

100
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:42.320
I can't wait to see that.

101
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.360
That's me rubbing my hands together with the microphone on my head.
Anyways,

102
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.460
the last man on earth is a is absolutely,
uh,
you know,

103
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:51.990
you don't want you to searching for a new show.

104
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.750
I still been searching ever since.
Breaking bad went off the year,

105
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:55.920
you know what I mean?
Just trying to,
you know,

106
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.060
I saw the killing killing was great and I blew through that cause it's fucking

107
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:03.500
Netflix,
right?
They've got all of them.
They turn you into a junkie,

108
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.910
right?
Instead of just giving you a little bit a week,

109
00:06:05.911 --> 00:06:09.320
can you keep your habit and in control like the networks,
fucking Netflix.

110
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.520
You just sit there,
you know,
you'll lose a Wiki your life.
Um,

111
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.580
so anyways,
I gotta watch this and then I got,

112
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.640
I got to get caught up on better call Saul because I was overseas when it came

113
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.600
out.
And uh,
I'm really bad with,
with,
you know,

114
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.710
looking shit up on the Internet and trying to find out where to watch it.

115
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.830
I want to watch it legally.
Um,

116
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.570
if anybody knows where I can watch like the first two episodes,

117
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:37.490
because I'm now taping the series,
I'm really excited.
But,
uh,

118
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.150
I'm going to do one little spoiler thing on last man on earth.
All right.

119
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.210
It's going to go down here and about to fucking,
well,
I'll do the,

120
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.900
it's going down right now.
All right.
So it's fucking stick your fingers in your,

121
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.890
I'm going to time this out perfectly.
10 seconds.
I'm going to say it all right.

122
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.020
In three,
two,

123
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.930
one Kristen Schaal is also on it.

124
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:00.800
She absolutely fucking kills it and blew me away with their acting and I'm just

125
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:01.910
so fucking site.

126
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.620
Whenever I see a standup comic or Comedians in general showing this industry

127
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:09.230
that we are actually can really be good actors,
they fucking kill it.

128
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.830
I absolutely love the show.
Please watch it.
All right,
done.
Okay.
Anyways,

129
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.410
I'm plowing ahead here.
Uh,
so all right,

130
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.610
I'm over the technology thing.

131
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.440
I'm actually in such a fucking great movie after it being back in New York,
uh,

132
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.840
which I loved,
you know,
taking the subway and shit.

133
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:28.580
I miss doing that stuff and seeing,
you know,

134
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.480
fucking neurotic people and crazy people and uh,

135
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.790
I dunno,
you know what I miss most about living in la?
This is going to be weird.

136
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.780
You know what?
I missed Puerto Ricans,
you know what I mean?

137
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.810
They just don't have any Puerto Rican self here.
I don't know what it is.

138
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.180
Not that there's anything wrong with Mexican people,
but you know,

139
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.900
La could use some Puerto Rican if fucking women are gorgeous.

140
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:53.840
I was on the subway or in a restaurant was like God damn,
look at her.

141
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.960
And I was like,
that's right.
Puerto Rican women.

142
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.690
That's what's been missing from my day to day plus New York.

143
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.120
You know what I mean?
Not everybody's not hiding in cars.
You know,

144
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:08.450
they're fucking on the subways and shit walking down the street.

145
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.310
A bunch of cutie pies.
I Dunno.
Anyways,

146
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.160
so,
but you know what I do love about living out here.

147
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:19.120
I love when it's like the level that has been studied.

148
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.130
It's been snowing back on the east coast to just drop into that and actually be

149
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:27.350
excited to see snow.
You know,
skipping down the street,

150
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.130
wanting to make a snowman and shit and everybody else has totally miserable.

151
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.390
There's nothing more fun.
And everybody back east.
You probably at this point,

152
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:40.220
if you're,
you know,
over the age of 22 or 23 you have that douchebag,

153
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.340
east coast friend that moved to southern California or someplace warm and you

154
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:49.220
know what we do,
right?
You know we do.
We just wait for a couple to,
we,

155
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.950
we time it right?
Not during the holidays,

156
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:56.120
during the holidays were on radio silence cause that's when we were missing the

157
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:58.280
winner.
Right?
All the fucking went,

158
00:08:58.281 --> 00:09:01.000
all the fucking Christmas songs are all about snow right here.

159
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.450
Sleigh bells ringing.
Link.
Thank.

160
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.460
Thank tingling to it's fucking snowing and ba Ba ba Ba ba right.

161
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.490
Giddyup Giddyup Giddyup let's go.
Let's look at us though.

162
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.300
Told you I was in a good mood.
The wonderland ups know a fuck.

163
00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:18.250
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

164
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.210
You know I'm going to have native Americans relate to that fucking Christmas

165
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:25.044
music,
right?

166
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.520
Is White people are in the and Giddyup Giddyup Giddyup let's go.

167
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.360
You used to live here,
then we can emit it.

168
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.000
Fucking Jana side yellow.

169
00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.940
Now we have a fuck house where you use to fucking laid,
bup,
bup,
bup,
bup,
bup,

170
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.930
Oberlo you know,

171
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:45.931
the nerve of us to write such happy songs on the same land that that fucking

172
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:47.500
horror happened.

173
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.170
Oh,
you know,
Dasher and dancer and Prancer and Vixen,

174
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.750
the Cherokee,
those sue,
the cro and Apache.
Where did they go?

175
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.650
Go.
Um,
anyways,

176
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.060
uh,
so you know the deal.

177
00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:11.650
So we love to fucking call up in January and February.

178
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.180
The best time to do it is right at the end of January when these poor cons back

179
00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:19.830
east,
now they've got another month that they shit,
right?

180
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.580
It's just desolate,
right?
You've already the high of a New Year,

181
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.360
you've already fucked up your New Year's resolutions and you just coming out

182
00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:29.880
right with the,
a fucking ice scraper

183
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.540
every fucking goddamn morning.

184
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.250
Then that's when we call acting like we don't know what we're doing.

185
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.210
What's going on?
Don't know why.
Yeah,
yeah.
About them.

186
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:46.320
Bruin says starting to finally fucking play,
you know,
a seed or whatever.

187
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.080
What I,
they got to rebuild kit.
So,
uh,
you know,
what's going on.
But back then,

188
00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:54.990
right?
You do the whole fucking thing.
Oh Geez.
Bloggers,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.

189
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:59.730
And then that's when he get to hit.
Ah,
Oh,
what out here?
Yeah.
I don't,

190
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.390
you know,
I haven't looked.
I think it feels like about like 68 degrees.
Yeah.

191
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:06.060
I'm standing out here wearing a hoodie and Pajama bottoms,

192
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.080
taking my dog for a walk.
Probably going to go on a hike a little bit later,

193
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.910
get a breakfast burrito.

194
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.930
I fucking love it.
I absolutely love it.
And then when I got to go back,

195
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.850
you know,
you visit winner,
it visited for a few days,
you know,
you fucking,

196
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.160
you know,
get yourself a hot chocolate,
you go skating or whatever.

197
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:30.250
You do your little fucking thing.
I love watching people back east,
dig it up,

198
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.220
dig it out there,
fucking cars,
you know,

199
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:37.060
and just talk every fucking year just talking about how sick of this,
the snow,

200
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.470
you know,

201
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.080
and I always want the person on the other side of the microphone would be like,

202
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:45.620
yeah,
but it's winter.
Yeah.
People just do it.
And then the summertime,
oh my God,

203
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:50.020
it's fucking he way.
But yes,
so sour.
It's sour.
You understand

204
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.130
there's too many fucking people.

205
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.300
We've put too much fucked up shit in the air and you were going to have crazy

206
00:11:57.301 --> 00:12:00.990
weather.
It's going to be crazy cold and it's going to be crazy.
Fucking hot.

207
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

208
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.680
<v 0>What would you rather do?
Like I was thinking the other day,</v>

209
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.280
would you rather have global warming or to have it go back to the Ice Age?

210
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.883
You know,

211
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.420
would you rather have the fucking the water and I'm not saying whether we're

212
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:17.400
creating it a,
not all the,
you know,

213
00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:20.280
I think that without a doubt you can't have 7 billion people not having an

214
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:25.080
effect on the planet.
I know we are.
I went to Asia,
I saw it,
I breathe it in.

215
00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:29.670
I held that tobacco with my fingers.
I just sounded like fucking Al Gore man.

216
00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:33.780
When he ran for office and he was trying to talk to people down to Carolina,

217
00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:38.560
going like,
ah,
ah,
I till the land,
I held that the grass,

218
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.760
some fingers sitting there.

219
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.430
Why the fuck would you ever say that we were in a suit and wingtips but you're

220
00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:48.330
dirty people staring at you.
Like what the fuck is this guy talking about?
Huh?

221
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.850
What's he have a garden in the backyard of his fucking villa?
Um,
no,

222
00:12:53.851 --> 00:12:58.050
I just saw what
the direction we were.
Fortunately,

223
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:01.050
the population over here is,
uh,
we're keeping it at bay,

224
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.530
but just the amount of shit that we buy.
I think a,

225
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:07.170
we create more waste or whatever,
but I will tell you this dude,

226
00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:10.380
like the air quality over there was devastating.

227
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.550
Fucking devastating.
Like I felt like I was smoking five packs a day.

228
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.840
Like I had this scratchiness in my throat when I was in Hong Kong and it got

229
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:20.340
even worse in India.

230
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:23.060
And I'm not shitting on either country and I'm not shitting on the people there

231
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.680
because I love both countries and the people were awesome.
But you know,

232
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.580
you got to admit the fucking air quality is a,

233
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.590
it's horrific.
And right there that's,

234
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:36.060
that is too many people having an effect on the,
yeah,

235
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.550
it happens.
There's too many at one fucking thing.
That's why you know,
these,

236
00:13:40.551 --> 00:13:43.050
these goddamn diseases,

237
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.290
all of this shit that we think of fucking evil and all of that,

238
00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:50.940
the a bolas and size,
all of that shit is,

239
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.190
is it's there for a reason.

240
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.070
So what's the great thing about nature is it's all there.

241
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.870
It all serves a fucking purpose.

242
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.210
And the purpose of that shit is to keep us in line.
You know what I mean?

243
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.790
That's what it is.
But the fatal flaw is,
uh,

244
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.630
in nature is us,
it's us.
We're too fucking smart for our own good.

245
00:14:12.631 --> 00:14:15.360
So rather than fucking,
you know,
a bunch of us dying off,

246
00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:18.240
like what happens to every fucking God damn animal?

247
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.750
Something happens if a disease doesn't run through that,

248
00:14:21.751 --> 00:14:25.500
that species of forest fire gets him.
You know,

249
00:14:25.501 --> 00:14:28.470
we came up with medicine and all of this shit and there's a bunch of people,

250
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:30.360
like I told you,
I should not be here right now.

251
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.590
I should've died of an apparent in a ruptured appendix when I was in the sixth

252
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:35.730
grade.
All right.

253
00:14:35.731 --> 00:14:40.680
But they got modern medicine and here I am just taking up space,

254
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.020
right?
I try.
I get a Prius,
I recycle the water bottles,
but you know,

255
00:14:46.021 --> 00:14:47.370
they just throw them in the ocean.

256
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:52.790
I'm just another con that shouldn't be here walking around taking his shit that

257
00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:56.120
ends up in a lake.
Right.

258
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.620
I didn't know where the fuck I'm going with this shit.
But,
um,

259
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.160
the fuck I totally lost my train.
I said,
I'm so fucking stupid.

260
00:15:06.161 --> 00:15:09.580
I shouldn't even be like if I,
if I actually had to live off the Goddamn land,

261
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.270
I would be walking through the woods tracking something to halfway through it.

262
00:15:13.271 --> 00:15:14.320
I would get distracted,

263
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:19.000
forget what I was hunting and I would starve to death.

264
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.830
Right.
Isn't that how it works?
I don't know how it works.
But anyways,
um,

265
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.370
I love it.
I love that it's fucking snowing back then.

266
00:15:27.371 --> 00:15:29.170
There's all kinds of shit going on.
I didn't like that.
Uh,

267
00:15:29.171 --> 00:15:32.770
that ice rink back in Massachusetts collapsed.

268
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.220
Thank God there was no kids out there skating or anything like that.
Um,

269
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.770
you know,
Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ,

270
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.390
that would have been fucking brutal.

271
00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:45.620
But there's all this shit going on back then.
I don't,

272
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:47.020
I don't understand how this works,

273
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:52.021
but there's been so much snow that I guess they have in this problem.

274
00:15:52.241 --> 00:15:55.270
My heart goes out to everybody back there cause I've had water damage in my

275
00:15:55.271 --> 00:16:00.271
house and it is a fucking nightmare is a fucking nightmare.

276
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.450
But basically there's so much snow up on the roofs and then it starts to melt

277
00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:06.910
during the day and then at night it freezes.

278
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.920
So then what happens is during the day when it starts to melt again,

279
00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:15.040
for some reason I guess it melts down at the surface,
which makes no sense.

280
00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:18.250
I figured that'd be the coldest or whatever.
The snow at the top trickles down.

281
00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:21.370
Somehow it gets underneath this better ice and then there's no,

282
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:25.990
it can't run off the roof and it's so eventually just gets absorbed into the

283
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:28.890
roof and starts leaking down.
So they're doing this thing with,

284
00:16:28.891 --> 00:16:32.560
it's starting to clear off the roots and roots and they put these salts socks up

285
00:16:32.561 --> 00:16:37.180
there.
They never had that shit when I was a kid.
I never heard of that.

286
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.440
I guess you'd take a tube sock,

287
00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:42.100
you fill it up with some of that rock salt and then you just lay it down on the

288
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.780
roof and somehow,
I don't know.
I love that.

but there's a bunch of cons back then because everybody's house is um,

291
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.200
you know,
getting water damage.

292
00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:58.210
They're in a panic and the charging thousands of dollars to go up there.

293
00:16:58.211 --> 00:17:01.060
Can you imagine fucking doing that?
That fucking piece of shit.
People,

294
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:05.380
some old person who doesn't want to go up there or just in general,

295
00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:07.270
if you've got some kids and stuff,
I mean,
you know,

296
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:11.320
you don't go up on the roof anyways if you've got a wife and kids,
right.

297
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.300
But the fucking,
you're not going up on a snowy roof in these fucking assholes.

301
00:17:28.031 --> 00:17:28.810
If I was president,

302
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.890
I would find out who the fuck was doing it and I would audit all of them.

431
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.490

436
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.380

437
00:25:22.381 --> 00:25:26.070

<v 0>um,

440
00:25:30.361 --> 00:25:31.710
I was gonna have a big announcement about,

441
00:25:31.711 --> 00:25:35.850
I'm gonna start doing a podcast every random Thursday,
maybe like twice a month.

442
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.740
I don't know how I'm going to do this and I also need a name for that one.

443
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.453
<v 1>MMM.</v>

444
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.960
<v 0>I have a hell of a time trying to come up with that shit.
I'm not good at that.</v>

445
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:46.210
I'm going to run my fucking mouth.
All right.
Here we are.

446
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:51.130
I'm on bill burr shows.
All right,
here we go.

447
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.800
For those of you who are at your cubicle right now,

448
00:25:53.801 --> 00:25:56.170
and you got to pretend that you're working and you're actually on a phone call,

449
00:25:56.171 --> 00:26:01.060
I'll read you the dates that we got up here so far,
um,
that are on sale.

450
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.000
All right.
April 10th.
I'll be in Miami Beach,

451
00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:08.350
Florida at the Fillmore,
Miami beach at the Jackie Gleason theater.

452
00:26:08.351 --> 00:26:11.140
And I played this place before and I didn't go upstairs.

453
00:26:11.141 --> 00:26:15.310
They have Jackie Gleason's office up there with a bunch of stuff that he had a

454
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.310
leftover,
you know,
that he would have morning he died.
They just kept it there.

455
00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:21.130
It's a little shrine.
And I didn't know about that until after I left.

456
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.070
And I remember someone was like,
Hey,
did you go up and see it?
And I was like,

457
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.480
I was fucking pissed.

458
00:26:25.481 --> 00:26:29.500
I didn't cause I used to love watching the honeymooners and I love the Jackie

459
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.060
Gleason show.

460
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.893
<v 1>MMM.</v>

461
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.960
<v 0>Anyways,
April 11th I'll be in Tampa,</v>

462
00:26:34.961 --> 00:26:36.910
Florida at the Ruth.

463
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.640
<v 0>Echo read hall.
Ruth Eckerd hall.
I don't know the fuck you say that.
Um,</v>

465
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.980
for two shows.
April 11th.
All right.

466
00:26:44.981 --> 00:26:47.770
And then the southern tour starts for some reason,
Miami,

467
00:26:47.771 --> 00:26:51.670
I mean a Florida is not considered part of the south even though they were part

468
00:26:51.671 --> 00:26:54.370
of the southern tour.
Last time we did a,

469
00:26:54.371 --> 00:26:57.880
we did Tampa and then we went up to Tallahassee,
the Florida state,
I believe.

470
00:26:57.881 --> 00:27:01.510
So anyways,
April 18th,
I'm going to be in Savannah,
Georgia.

471
00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.850
Um,
April 19th,
Knoxville,
Tennessee.
It fucking kills me.

472
00:27:06.851 --> 00:27:08.800
Then I'm going there and it's not football season.

473
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.720
That's on my bucket list to go to a Tennessee volunteer game,
man.
See that?

474
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.120
Purina cat chow and zone,
that checkerboard thing.

475
00:27:16.121 --> 00:27:20.560
Watching everybody go one notch down there.
Having a sec.

476
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.380
Football mother fucker.

477
00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.470
Chattanooga,
Tennessee.
April 20th,
Memphis,
Tennessee.

478
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.920
April 21st.
And I know what you thinking.
How come you didn't go to Nashville?

479
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.580
Because that's not what this tour's about.
Everybody goes to Tennessee,

480
00:27:36.581 --> 00:27:40.060
goes to Nashville and then every cut in Tennessee who doesn't live there?

481
00:27:40.061 --> 00:27:43.510
It's got to drive over to Nashville.
Guess what?
This sick of going to Nashville,

482
00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.350
Knoxville,
Chattanooga and Memphis.
All right.

483
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.470
April 26.
I'll be in Huntsville,
Alabama.
All right.

484
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.010
April 27th,
Jackson,
Mississippi.

485
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.440
All right.
Um,
may

486
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.290
was it May 1st Evansville,
Indiana.
Well that's not the south.
Ah,
whatever.

487
00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:11.260
We always got throw one wildcard in there.
Who the fuck goes to Evansville?

488
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.860
Nobody.
All right.
Um,
the,
just to let you know,
there's,

489
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.690
there's going to be some more dates in there.
Um,
we got some,
uh,

490
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.600
I think,
I think I got at least one other Mississippi date.

491
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.320
I'm so fucking excited about this.
I apps,

492
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.130
I have to tell you guys how much I love the fucking south.

493
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.770
Have I ever told you that?
Huh?

494
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.210
All the old cars you see the fucking people know how to fix up driving around

495
00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:37.540
out there.
All the great barbecue,
all these fucking awesome places to eat.

496
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.480
The fucking music.
I absolute,

497
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.010
I fucking love it down there and I um,
I can't wait to go down there.

498
00:28:45.011 --> 00:28:49.450
So anyways,
uh,

Actually.

Tampa and Miami beach are all on sale and a,

502
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.940
I might as well keep going here for people who aren't in the south.
Uh,

503
00:29:03.941 --> 00:29:08.860
I'm playing the Wilbur and a Boston,
Massachusetts.
I'm doing a whole week.

504
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.280
I'm doing a week,
Ron Belper at the Wilbur.
Alright.

505
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.500

that's all I'm gonna tell you that,

508
00:29:27.131 --> 00:29:30.010

you know?
Uh,

509
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.640
cause I'm going to be fucking seen a bunch of friends I love that's going to be

510
00:29:33.641 --> 00:29:35.800
so fucking awesome.
Yeah.
That's what all comes down to.

511
00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.360
It's all comes down to the fucking friends.

512
00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:40.690
I see that I meet on the road and the fucking cigars.
I smoke,

513
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.770
although I've been keeping that in line this year.
Uh,

514
00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.800
going easy on the cigars going EEG.
And the last date I have here,

515
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.900
June 26th and 27th,
um,

516
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.220
I'm going to be at the Mirage Casino and Las Vegas and my new hours coming

517
00:29:55.221 --> 00:30:00.080
together.
I just did 92,
many stars and I was backstage going,
what do I do?

518
00:30:00.081 --> 00:30:03.350
Do I do a couple of leftover bits?
Um,

519
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.630
do I do a couple of leftover bits from my last special that didn't make it or do

520
00:30:08.631 --> 00:30:11.840
I go with some new shit?
And I just said,
fuck it.
I'm going with my new shit.

521
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.110
Fuck it.
I'm not doing another special for another year and a half.

522
00:30:15.111 --> 00:30:19.340
Like I won't come up with another 10 minutes.
I know I can do that.
And uh,

523
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.400
I don't know.
That's my philosophy.
Fuck that.
You go hard,

524
00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.480
come out with your best shit and just have faith that you're going to come up

525
00:30:26.481 --> 00:30:31.310
with something else.
Um,
I hope I did the material justice.
It was a,

526
00:30:31.311 --> 00:30:34.610
it was a really fun,
it was a really fun set.
And,
uh,

527
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.930
there was somebody famous in the crowd that was just fucking nothing,

528
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.230
just got nothing,
which always fucking kills you.
Like they're famous.

529
00:30:42.231 --> 00:30:46.700
They know things,
you know.
But anyways,
so that I'm,
I'm really excited about that.

530
00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:50.150
And uh,
like I said,
uh,
Jason Law,
Paul Versey,

531
00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.940
I got the whole fucking crew coming around again.

532
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.310
Now we got coach coming out,
uh,
j law heads,
Hall of fame,

533
00:30:58.311 --> 00:31:01.840
uh,
high school basketball coach.

534
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.730
Dad's coming along and uh,
we got it all worked out,

535
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.290
couldn't get the same bus driver,
which sucks.
He's,
uh,

536
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.290
I dunno,
I think we thought what was going to be in May at first,

537
00:31:12.291 --> 00:31:14.330
but now it's going to be in April and he's driving a band,

538
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:18.160
def Leppard actually through Canada,
so he can't be there.
But that stinks.

539
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.130
So we'll get him next time.

540
00:31:19.131 --> 00:31:21.200
But he recommended somebody that hopefully we're going to get,

541
00:31:21.201 --> 00:31:24.560
we'll have a good time,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and all that bullshit.
So,

542
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.780
um,
I need a name for the tour.

543
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.010
I'd love to hear your suggestions and um,

544
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:36.110
let me see what else.
You know what the easiest way to do it?
Just send it to the,

545
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:39.950
um,
which I don't fucking have of course,

546
00:31:39.951 --> 00:31:43.310
because I'm a dumb fuck.
Oh,
this,
this podcast.
You know what?

547
00:31:43.311 --> 00:31:45.620
This was a good podcast right up til the light.
It just did.

548
00:31:45.621 --> 00:31:47.360
The whole fucking thing just went off the rails.

549
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.670
How dumb is it that I don't even know?

550
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.630
I don't even know what the Twitter handle is for my own fucking podcast.

551
00:31:53.631 --> 00:31:57.410
He realized how fucking not even sad at this point.
Don't,
don't you guys?
Yeah.

552
00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.910
Built.
Yeah.
We expect that out of you.

553
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.170
We expect that lack of professionalism at the m m

554
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.040
<v 1>okay.</v>

555
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.670
<v 0>Podcast.
Is that what it is?
What is it?</v>

556
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:14.430
Oh,
go fuck yourself,
Bill.
You,
you suck.
You just fucking suck.

557
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.570
I'm the worst.
I don't even know what it is.

558
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.590
Somebody find it and then fucking tweet me it so I know what my own God.
Damn,

559
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.980
I can't even find the thing.
I follow it.
It should be coming up.

560
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

561
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.260
<v 0>Is it at the M and podcast?</v>

562
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.320
I'm sorry you guys have to listen to this.
There it is.
I got it.
All right,

563
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:38.630
so at the m m podcast,
um,

564
00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.070
if you could just tweet me your ideas for the name of the southern tour and um,

565
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.350
I already know some of you are going to be a little wacky with your ideas

566
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:51.080
slapping on the knee there,
um,
for that or the Thursday podcast.
Um,

567
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.890
even if I don't use what you have,
I'll,

568
00:32:52.891 --> 00:32:56.550
there will be a nice jump off point for me and I'm,

569
00:32:56.551 --> 00:32:57.690
I can actually come up with something.

570
00:32:57.691 --> 00:32:59.460
I'm going to come up with a real cool tour poster.

571
00:32:59.461 --> 00:33:02.870
I'm going to sign all of the posters and a,

572
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:07.200
I'll be out there during the southern tour.
Uh,
you know,
shaking hands,

573
00:33:07.201 --> 00:33:10.200
kissing babies and all that shit.
And,
uh,
all I ask you guys,

574
00:33:10.201 --> 00:33:13.740
you just tell us where to go get some drinks and where the cool places are to

575
00:33:13.741 --> 00:33:18.360
eat.
Um,
and we do not want to go to any chains.

576
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.650
We want to go to the fucking spot.
And if the spot is the shit,

577
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.720
the local mom and pop places to shit,

578
00:33:24.721 --> 00:33:29.550
I promise you I will not tell anybody about it because you know,

579
00:33:29.551 --> 00:33:31.380
as much as the food network and all of them,
you know,

580
00:33:31.381 --> 00:33:35.190
they have their heart in the right fucking place.
Uh,

581
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.450
you know,

582
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.410
they end up blowing up the place and then every dose like me comes to town,

583
00:33:40.411 --> 00:33:40.681
you know,

584
00:33:40.681 --> 00:33:44.730
with my fucking flip flops and a brochure and then you can't get a seat there

585
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:47.730
anymore.
So I won't do it.
I won't do that to you.
But uh,
if you could let us know,

586
00:33:47.731 --> 00:33:50.670
that would be fucking tremendous.
Um,
so anyways,

587
00:33:50.671 --> 00:33:52.900
I just mentioned that I'm trying to keep my cigar smoking.

588
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.010
I'm trying to get it under control and it's actually scary how many I've already

589
00:33:57.011 --> 00:33:59.200
smoked this year to actually count them.

590
00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.880
I smoked 13 so far.
And uh,

591
00:34:03.881 --> 00:34:07.750
that is a lot.
So I'm thinking last year where I didn't even pay attention,

592
00:34:07.751 --> 00:34:11.740
I easily smoked over a hundred fucking sick guys.
I must have every three,

593
00:34:11.741 --> 00:34:15.400
four days,
I would think.
So sometimes I go,
you know,
and then,
you know,

594
00:34:15.401 --> 00:34:18.700
sometimes they go like 10,
12 days,
but then I go on like a three day run,

595
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.900
but I was hanging with versa or something like that.
And uh,
I know it's bad.

596
00:34:22.901 --> 00:34:27.010
I know I got to stop and there was a,
you know,

597
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.990
Leonard Nimoy passing away,
his last fucking tweet is,
uh,
don't smoke.

598
00:34:31.991 --> 00:34:36.460
I wish I didn't.
Something like that.
Live long and prosper and uh,

599
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.690
you know,
the guy was like fucking 83,
84 years old.

600
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.470
And even then if you're laying on your deed,
think,
you know,
as a young person,

601
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:48.070
he'd be like,
Oh man,
that's a great run.
I'd love to fucking live that long.

602
00:34:48.071 --> 00:34:52.780
But when you fucking facing it at 83 84 and it's still too early,

603
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:58.240
you know what I mean?
I just think if,
if you die because of your lifestyle,

604
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.320
I think that's a tough one to get over when you lie in there.
You know,

605
00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:04.450
it's one thing if you just,
you know,

606
00:35:04.451 --> 00:35:06.580
something tragic happens and that that's not yours.

607
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.210
But if you are actually shoveling something India fucking mouth that caused you

608
00:35:10.211 --> 00:35:13.210
to die earlier and spend less days on earth,
I mean,

609
00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:14.200
that's gotta be a motherfucker.

610
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.220
And just the fact that the guy 84 still had a little bit of regret about that.

611
00:35:19.901 --> 00:35:21.010
That was really an eye opener.

612
00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:25.880
So I was trying to do one cigar week this year,

613
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:30.020
which is still 52 fucking cigars.
Right?
That's fucking ridiculous.

614
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.460
That's still unacceptable.
So anyways,
so right now we're about nine weeks in.

615
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.840
I should be on cigar number nine and I'm already up to 13 should be all the way

616
00:35:37.841 --> 00:35:41.740
into April.
So I'm actually going to take this month off.

617
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:43.650
I'm not going to smoke any,

618
00:35:43.651 --> 00:35:46.990
although a buddy of mine's coming to town Friday and they already said we're

619
00:35:46.991 --> 00:35:50.250
going to smoke.
Well,
maybe you have to number 14 oh Geez.
That's a rough one,

620
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:54.870
you know?
MMM.
Anyways,
I got to get this thing under control.

621
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:59.600
I'm really good at like,
I don't have any cigars in my house anymore.
Uh,

622
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.410
the,
the fucking human door is shut down.
Yeah.

623
00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.400
Whatever the fuck he call humidifier.
Oh,
that's for fucking singers.

624
00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.250
Humidors for fucking gap.
There you go.
Yeah.
That's shut down.

625
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.270
I'm not fucking using that thing anymore.
And uh,

626
00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.860
I've been booze and way less you once in a while.
I got to shut it down.
But uh,

627
00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:23.030
anyways,
let me talk about the goddamn comedy jam,
everybody.
So last week I had,

628
00:36:23.031 --> 00:36:27.200
for the fourth time I did it.
This is my favorite fucking show to do.
And uh,

629
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:30.680
this time we did a guns and roses paradise city.

630
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.210
I dressed up like Steven Adler,
one of my favorite drummers of all time.
And uh,

631
00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.901
it was really cool.

632
00:36:35.901 --> 00:36:39.570
I watched a bunch of old guns and roses videos just to see how,

633
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:43.640
what he dressed like and just watch how he played,
uh,

634
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.670
to do maybe a mini impression of him,
which I don't think I did.
I,
cause I'm,

635
00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:50.910
I'm not comfortable enough playing in front of them.
Uh,
Pat Club.
Yeah,

636
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.890
playing live like this point to actually throw in a little bit of an

637
00:36:53.891 --> 00:36:56.980
impersonation of the drummer.
I'll,
I'll get to that level of comfort,

638
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.140
comfort because that's what I'm working on each time.

639
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.730
Each time I play a little bit better,
but I'm still at the point of like,

640
00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:08.860
oh my God,
don't fuck this song up.
Um,
which I always do,
which I always do,
but uh,

641
00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:13.030
this is what was the best that I played.
And I'm not gonna lie to you,

642
00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:17.440
man for a bunch of comedians.
We fucking killed it for a professional band.

643
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:22.360
I Dunno.
But,
uh,
it was so much fucking fun.
And,

644
00:37:22.361 --> 00:37:27.100
um,
I think I tweeted a couple of pictures of me dressed to Steven Adler,

645
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.050
you know,
it's fucking hilarious though,
was uh,

646
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.260
he wore like a lot of like tank tops and shit like that,

647
00:37:32.261 --> 00:37:33.340
which I wasn't going to wear.

648
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.990
I'm too fucking self conscious about my pasty torso.
So,
uh,

649
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.980
he wore some vests and shit like that,

650
00:37:38.981 --> 00:37:43.000
so I just had a white t shirt and I bought like this leather vest and a,

651
00:37:43.001 --> 00:37:45.580
with the wig and the sunglasses.
It looked funny.
Right.

652
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.070
But I gotta tell you at one point,
you know,

653
00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.190
I was at home by myself and I had the t shirt on.

654
00:37:51.191 --> 00:37:54.980
I had on the leather vest and I put the sunglasses on it.
And before it,

655
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.200
before I put the wig on,
I looked in the mirror and I looked like rob hello.

656
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.780
You know,
not to say he doesn't look good in a vest.

657
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.670
I'm just saying I shouldn't shit on him.
Um,
yeah.
I,

658
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.790
I cannot pull off a fucking leather vest.
That is,

659
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:21.200
that is a spa you need,
you need hair to pull that off.
All right.

660
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:24.980
If you don't,
you just,
I can't even tell you what I fucking look like.

661
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.560
I look like somebody output.

662
00:38:27.561 --> 00:38:31.280
Chino would have talked to and cruising back in back in the day in that fucking

663
00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:32.290
movie.
Um,

664
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.820
I would have bursted out if it wasn't so shocking.

665
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:42.040
How fucking silly I looked.
Um,
oh yeah,

666
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.980
it was bad.
It was bad.
But anyways,
I put the fucking wig on,

667
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.810
which was actually a woman's wig,
you know,

668
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:50.530
it's hard to find is a fucking heavy metal,
long blonde wig.

669
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:53.470
They just didn't have them,
was all black hair,
brown hair.

670
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.320
And then they had a one that was actually the right consistency,

671
00:38:56.321 --> 00:38:58.570
but it was his whitish kind of hair looks stupid.

672
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.860
So I had to fucking comb the thing down.
I looked fucking ridiculous.

673
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.280
I looked fucking ridiculous.
And everyone like,
you know,

674
00:39:05.281 --> 00:39:08.980
it was funny was when I came walking out,
uh,
the drummer in the band,

675
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.830
nick,
who plays Bass when I sit in,
he never,
he when he gets to see like,
well,

676
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.980
however I'm dressing up is as I walk out on stage and I saw him,

677
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:22.720
that's the hardest.
I saw him laughing.
So I knew it was a,
uh,
it was a good thing.

678
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:27.610
So then I just went up and I did a set and I basically was defending and add

679
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.900
Steven Adler saying that he shouldn't have been kicked out of guns and roses and

680
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:34.180
I knew all this nerdy shit about him.
So,
uh,

681
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.890
the crowd really enjoyed it and all the while I was reading his autobiography

682
00:39:38.891 --> 00:39:43.000
and I got as much as I love
Steven Adler,

683
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:46.210
I got to tell you when I read the fucking,
the book,

684
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.790
there was that fucking junky thing where he was not taking response.

685
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.960
That's like not once in the book did he say like,
all right,

686
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:56.200
I'm going to admit on this day or on this Gig,

687
00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.940
I was too fucked up to play and I played really sloppy.
It was just,

688
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:04.210
he always had some sort of a fucking reason.

689
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:08.020
But what I liked about the book was because I read slashes book and I still felt

690
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:13.021
like he was trying not to piss off axle because the chance of a reunion was

691
00:40:13.151 --> 00:40:17.290
still there.
And Axel,
so fucking I guess touchy or whatever.

692
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:20.650
What I did like about Adler's was he didn't give a shit and it seemed like he

693
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:23.290
didn't give a fuck either.
When he was in the band,

694
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:26.470
he had this great story of one night they went out to play,

695
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:30.710
they went out to play live and uh,
acts,

696
00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:33.790
it goes out to sing and the monitors were fucked up and he was just like,

697
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:36.760
fuck this show and walked off stage after two or three songs.

698
00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.050
And as he was walking by Adler,
he gave him shit and was like,

699
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:43.840
well axle maybe if you showed up for the fucking soundcheck,

700
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.040
things would sound right,
you know,
actually said.
Then I,
whenever I,

701
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.790
whenever I see shit,
whenever I read stuff about that band,

702
00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:53.800
cause I fucking love that band.
It was just like,
I don't know,

703
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:58.790
it's just awful watching how everybody just fucking let that guy spin out it.

704
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.040
At least it seems that way,
right?

705
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.440
You're like how I've read so many of those books actually think I know what

706
00:41:02.441 --> 00:41:04.630
happened in the band.
I'm going to shut up now.
I sound like a total nerd.

707
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.550
But anyways.
Um,

708
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.420
is there anything else I wanted to talk about this week before I get into your

709
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:14.380
questions?
Uh,
my momentarily mentioned that,
uh,

710
00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.720
the Bruins are starting to play better.

711
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.920
Thank God I mentioned native too many stars.

712
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:27.280
Uh,
what else?
What else?
I think that's it.
I think that's it.

713
00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.550
Um,
all right,
let's get into,
let's get into the,
uh,

714
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:34.830
the old questions here for the week.
All right,
drummer.
You know,

715
00:41:34.831 --> 00:41:38.610
I've seen this before.
Somebody sent this to me and said,
hey,
bill,

716
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.450
this article has been going around all week.
I'm sure someone sent it to you.

717
00:41:42.451 --> 00:41:44.730
It's about how drummers are more intelligent.

718
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:50.490
How's it feel to be the exception?
Uh,
he says,
just kidding.

719
00:41:50.491 --> 00:41:52.350
Go Fuck Yourself.
So obviously he's shitting on me.

720
00:41:52.351 --> 00:41:57.351
So there's this new study that claims that drummers are actually more

721
00:41:58.321 --> 00:42:01.380
intelligent than everyone.
So right there,
that's fucking ridiculous.

722
00:42:01.381 --> 00:42:05.550
That's not true.
But it's basically,
it says that,
uh,
because,
well,

723
00:42:05.551 --> 00:42:09.030
let me just read this thing.
Um,
according to a collection of studies,

724
00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:11.250
drummers are super smart dude.

725
00:42:11.251 --> 00:42:14.400
A variety of factors relating to being in the rhythm section.

726
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.600
So would that mean like the bass player and the rhythm guitarist or were the

727
00:42:18.601 --> 00:42:19.290
piano player,

728
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.770
whatever fucking you makes up your rhythm section would all be smarter.

729
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

730
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.890
<v 0>I Dunno,
the news comes courtesy of Pauli.</v>

731
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.710
Mick does it gives it to the fact that I can't even spell up.

732
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.860
I can't really say I'm a drama.
It's just a hobby.
Um,

733
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:36.790
who have compiled a series of reports from Oxford and Harvard.
Ooh,

734
00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.320
<v 5>Ooh,
universities.</v>

735
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.213
<v 0>So name a few.</v>

736
00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.150
What they found was that the dude at the back of the band isn't the head

737
00:42:42.151 --> 00:42:43.950
scratcher that you might think he is.
In fact,

738
00:42:43.951 --> 00:42:46.970
he's more likely to be the smartest of the mall.
For examples,

739
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:51.900
researchers at Stockholm's Karolinska Institute found that the drummers who kept

740
00:42:51.901 --> 00:42:55.960
a tighter rhythm also scored better on 60 question,
uh,

741
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.940
intelligent test.
This is a reflection of better problem solving skills,

742
00:42:59.941 --> 00:43:02.340
which creates a positive impact on those around them.

743
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.060
Or they just a smart person who decided to play drums.

744
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.610
So naturally they would score higher.
I don't know that I buy into that.

745
00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:13.700
I think that that's a,
uh,
it's,

746
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.870
I think this article is a reaction to all the,
the,
the drummer jokes.

747
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.120
Um,
you know,

748
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:24.130
for those usual that aren't in play music or whatever musician on as I guess is

749
00:43:24.131 --> 00:43:28.610
what you'd fucking call it.
That was,
you play music.

750
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:33.320
Hey,
for those of you play music,
um,
there's a brunch,

751
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:37.310
a drummer jokes like,
uh,
what do you call somebody who hangs around musicians,

752
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.820
a drummer,
you know,
um,

753
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.180
how do you know there's a drummer at the door than knocking speeds up?

754
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.750
I guess that's one of,
we're talking about our timing or whatever,
but like,
it's,

755
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.320
there's a lot in like drummers that are fucking morons who just bash shit in

756
00:43:51.321 --> 00:43:52.790
there.
They're not actually musicians.

757
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.680
So I think that this is a reaction to that to say

758
00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.750
<v 5>[inaudible] lead singer,
really good</v>

759
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.460
<v 0>tourists.
You know,
I think that that's just what this is.
So do I buy into it?
No,</v>

760
00:44:03.461 --> 00:44:06.160
I don't.
I don't,
I think that there's,
um,

761
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.680
you know,
I think that there's super smart people that decide,

762
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:12.740
<v 1>okay,</v>

763
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.230
<v 0>that are whatever,
get into music.
Some of them are drummers,</v>

764
00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:19.080
some of them play the fucking oboe.
But I don't think,
uh,

765
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:21.591
I gotta admit,
you know,

766
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:26.360
I've met a ton of drummers and it's just like meeting people.
Some are cool.

767
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:31.330
So assholes,
some of smart,
you know,
I think it's just a,
yeah,

768
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.080
I don't buy

769
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.770
<v 2>into it.
All right.
Whatever.
There we go.
All right.
How to not wreck your eyes.</v>

770
00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.210
<v 0>Okay,
Bill,
you are 100% correct.
Finally,</v>

771
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.910
if your eyes are trying to adjust for flicker,
it wears out.
Where's the amount?

772
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.770
Big Time.
Well it sounds very medical.
Um,

773
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.500
for this reason you never need,

774
00:44:50.501 --> 00:44:54.070
you never read or study under a single fluorescent bulb.

775
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.540
A buddy of mine lost his pilot qualification this way with only one fluorescent

776
00:44:58.541 --> 00:44:59.200
bulb.

777
00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.730
Your eyeball kills itself trying to dilate and constrict and an impossible

778
00:45:03.731 --> 00:45:04.511
speed.
Oh yeah.

779
00:45:04.511 --> 00:45:07.540
Cause it Kinda like flickers cause I don't understand fluorescent bulbs.

780
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.830
And I also don't understand why whenever I go to home depot I accidentally buy

781
00:45:11.831 --> 00:45:15.800
those every fucking time.
I look all over the box.

782
00:45:15.801 --> 00:45:19.280
I can't seem to find where it says fluorescent anyways.
Oh,
what,
what,

783
00:45:19.281 --> 00:45:23.430
what does a regular light called?
It's not fluorescent.

784
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:27.730
What's the good one?
The nice warm one that makes my eyes go right.
Ah,

785
00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:33.160
I can see.
What does it make your eyes bill do bill.
Ah,
okay.
Anyways,

786
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.680
my,
uh,
my buddy's eye doctor told,

787
00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.050
told him that if would have to study under fluorescent,

788
00:45:38.051 --> 00:45:42.240
make sure it's at least two bulbs.
All you'll wreck your eyes.
Uh,

789
00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.960
as he did his hope.
This helps.
Well,

790
00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.620
you know what can help if somebody helped me fucking read that God damn thing.

791
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:53.640
Um,
all right,
franchise.
This is hilarious.

792
00:45:53.641 --> 00:45:57.120
I'm finally allowing enough time to get through all the goddamn reads and now I

793
00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:02.080
have nothing to say about any of them.
Alright.
Franchise Bill.

794
00:46:02.081 --> 00:46:04.420
Not sure if anyone asks you.
Uh,

795
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:10.060
not sure if anyone's asked you think before.
Once again,

796
00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:15.820
people not proofreading.
I already have a difficult time reading out loud bill.

797
00:46:15.821 --> 00:46:20.260
Not sure if anyone's asked you what you think before,

798
00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:23.830
but if you could own a current sports franchise,

799
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:25.870
which would it be?

800
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.830
Or if you had to create a franchise for any sport in any city,

801
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.220
which would you pick?
What would you call the team?

802
00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.350
What city could really use a team in particular in a particular sport?
Thanks.

803
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:44.240
Um,
all right,
let's see here.
So I think somebody asked me this before,
all right.

804
00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:45.074
If I could,

805
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.053
<v 2>hmm.</v>

806
00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.800
<v 0>If I could own any sports team,
I'm like most sports fans,</v>

807
00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:54.801
I would want to own a sports team from the city that I'm from in back in the day

808
00:46:54.991 --> 00:46:59.490
when I was growing up,
I would then go to be the greatest owner of all time.

809
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.830
And not only would we win a championship,

810
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.800
we would win the most championships of in the sport.

811
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:10.130
And during the time that I own the team,
you know,
um,

812
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:15.170
but unfortunately that dream has died for me because not only do I have the

813
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:15.661
money,

814
00:47:15.661 --> 00:47:20.540
but every Boston team has gone out and won championships and uh,

815
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.880
you know,
so I,
I can't really,
I,

816
00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:28.070
am I going to be a better owner than Robert Craft?
No,

817
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.860
the people over at the Red Sox,
right.
The Bruins,
the Celtic I,
you know,

818
00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.130
what am I going to do?

819
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.260
I guess right now the team that I'm most concerned about will probably be the

820
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.980
Boston Celtics and I would want them to win a bunch of championships so they

821
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:49.900
stay out in front of the Lakers.
Um,
cause the Lakers have,
you know,

822
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:54.160
they've just won so many goddamn championships since the 70s.
It's insane.

823
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:56.220
And of course they count that one from the,
the,

824
00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:01.270
the Ba or whatever the fuck it is,
which is so fucking ridiculous.

825
00:48:01.271 --> 00:48:03.160
But such a classic La thing.

826
00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:06.250
I actually think it's funny that they do it because everybody out his pad and

827
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:09.400
their resume,
you know,
no one's a fucking waitress.
They're all an actress.

828
00:48:09.401 --> 00:48:12.100
Everybody's a director and that type of shit.
Sorry.
You want to see,
you got,

829
00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:13.450
you got 16.

830
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:18.610
We won an NBA championship before there was an NBA.
Oh,
did you?

831
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:22.600
How'd you do that?
Because we're in La.
Um,

832
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.990
so maybe that one I think,
but um,
I think,
um,

833
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:30.580
if I had to own any team,
I would,
it would probably be,

834
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:35.170
be a team in a city that I love,
a team that was probably great when I was a kid.

835
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.610
But isn't any more,

836
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:41.560
I would maybe a the turn the Pittsburgh pirates around or the Baltimore Orioles

837
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.650
even though they had a great year last year.
Um,

838
00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.070
let me see.
That's a damn good question.

839
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:51.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

840
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.210
<v 0>It's a damn good question.
I think,
uh,
I don't know.
There's so many fucking teams.</v>

841
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:58.360
I hate after awhile if you watch enough sports,
you fucking hate all of them.

842
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:03.160
You just like you a team,
let's say just stink every God damn year.

843
00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.281
I Dunno,
you know,

844
00:49:07.281 --> 00:49:12.281
back in the day I was thinking like a owning a Canadian hockey team cause they

845
00:49:13.641 --> 00:49:16.340
haven't had the cup there and so long it'd be cool to bring it back.

846
00:49:16.341 --> 00:49:20.150
Obviously it wouldn't be the Canadians and maple leaf fans are such fucking shit

847
00:49:20.151 --> 00:49:23.390
talking [inaudible] I wouldn't want them to see any success either.

848
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:25.100
And I gotta be honest with you.

849
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.940
We always lose to them and the gold medal game in the Olympics and then they'd

850
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:31.910
talk all this fucking shit.
You know what?
Fuck all those teams,
fuck them all.

851
00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:37.100
But if I had to pick one,
uh,
maybe I bring Edmonton Back Calgary.

852
00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:39.890
I like there was a time,
believe it or not,

853
00:49:39.891 --> 00:49:43.580
that I actually used to like Vancouver before we played them in the finals and

854
00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:46.190
then I fucking hate and but enough of them have left that,

855
00:49:46.191 --> 00:49:47.510
I think they have a new personality,

856
00:49:47.511 --> 00:49:51.650
but they still have the [inaudible] twins there.
Um,

857
00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:55.010
who I don't even know what,
why would I not like them?
What?
Cause they're good,

858
00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.040
I dunno.
Yeah.

859
00:49:58.041 --> 00:50:01.520
I think I would just be a hometown thing or like the Pittsburgh pirates or

860
00:50:01.521 --> 00:50:03.890
something like that or maybe bring a championship to Cleveland,

861
00:50:03.891 --> 00:50:07.250
I think would be great to make the browns.
Yeah.
Maybe I'd take the browns.

862
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:09.420
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

863
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.201
<v 0>I make the Browns,</v>

864
00:50:10.201 --> 00:50:13.800
but I would tell people to stop fucking eating dog biscuits in that type of
shit.

865
00:50:13.801 --> 00:50:15.240
That would be,
that would be the trade off.

866
00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.660
You have to come to the game dress like a human being.

867
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:20.490
You don't go there and humiliate yourself.

868
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.970
<v 6>Gold boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.</v>

869
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:27.920
<v 0>Thinking you're actually affecting the defense of the other team.
Like,
oh my God,</v>

870
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.760
fuck this 360 pound tackle that's going to be pulling that I have to fucking get

871
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:38.450
crushed by to force the run back to the inside.
Fuck all that.

872
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.800
There's a fan account and eaten a dog biscuit barking at me that's really

873
00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:46.940
messing with my focus man.
Um,
or you know,

874
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:49.370
maybe bring a football team to la,
but you know something.

875
00:50:49.371 --> 00:50:52.930
I don't think they deserve it.
All right.

876
00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.340
Fucking southern California fans.
All we have to San Francisco and Oakland,

877
00:50:57.341 --> 00:51:00.590
they're fucking horrific.
Not all of them,

878
00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:05.270
but just that they're a horrible fucking people who bring violence to the game

879
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:08.570
and they,
they beat up people who wear different uniforms.
I mean just,

880
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:13.590
I mean somebody gets shot at like a fucking 40 niners Raiders like preseason

881
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.200
game.
And what those fucking assholes at the dodger game did.
Did that family,

882
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:21.410
that father with a family where they had a couple of kids at guys,

883
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:26.120
he's brain dead.
Basically.
It's got permanent brain damage.
He took the,

884
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.590
they took this,
these kids dad away.
What does kids right there?

885
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:33.860
There's no excuse.
You saw that he was a father,
so fuck all of them.

886
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:37.990
They don't deserve a fucking team.
There you go.
Um,

887
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:41.330
that answers,
that answers your question.
All right.

888
00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:46.010
Name change or not?
All right.
This is a crazy one.

889
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:47.270
Hey,
yo,
belly.

890
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:51.920
I have heard you talk about isis a few times on the Monday morning podcast,

891
00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:55.430
so I thought I'd ask your opinion on something that's been bothering me for a

892
00:51:55.431 --> 00:51:56.264
while now.

893
00:51:56.270 --> 00:52:00.770
My husband and I had our child in the fall of 2013 throughout my pregnancy.

894
00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:04.430
We spent a lot of time trying to come up with the perfect name and tried to make

895
00:52:04.431 --> 00:52:06.830
sure it was a name that no one could make fun of.

896
00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:08.200
<v 1>Okay,</v>

897
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.460
<v 0>and why don't you just go with Susan?</v>

898
00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:12.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.220
<v 0>Kathy,
Karen,
all the classics.
No one's going to give you shit about those.</v>

900
00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:17.140
After months and months of debate,

901
00:52:17.141 --> 00:52:22.141
we finally settled on the name Isis after the Bob Dylan Song.

902
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:25.800
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

903
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:30.800
<v 0>I don't understand what happens to two parents between being a child and being</v>

904
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.510
picked on and bullied and all that type.
There's just something about it.

905
00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.640
When you become a parent,
you just forget and you buy your kids stupid clothes.

906
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.560
Please beat the shit out of me clothes.

907
00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.780
And then you give your kid a name like Isis.
Let's just say Isis.

908
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:51.660
The terrorist group didn't exist.
All right.

909
00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:56.580
Isn't that Lego?
That's I guess when I was a kid,
isis was,
I got to look this up.

910
00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:01.980
That was like a,
there was some superhero that was a woman.
All Mighty Isis.

911
00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.350
Isis.
Isis,
right?

912
00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:05.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

913
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.610
<v 0>Well,
because people who like named their kid like Thor.
All right.</v>

914
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.090
Isis woman.
It's my search.

915
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:14.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

916
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.010
<v 0>Hero.</v>

917
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.540
This is going to put me on an FBI fucking watch list because Isis and heroin and

918
00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:19.383
the same thing.
Yeah.

919
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:21.150
<v 4>MMM.</v>

920
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:28.060
<v 0>Images for Isis.
Woman Hero.
Isis TV series 75 76.
I remember that.</v>

921
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:31.630
She go all mighty isis.
Isis,
Isis.
And then she,
it was like,

922
00:53:31.631 --> 00:53:36.630
it was a rip off a wonder woman.
Isis.
DC comics.
Here we go.
Um,

923
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.203
<v 4>here we go.</v>

924
00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:43.470
<v 0>My slow ass Internet.
Hey,
we go.</v>

925
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:47.430
Isis is a DC comics superhero.
God Damn,
look at her.

926
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:54.010
Holy Shit.
I swear to God,
man.

927
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.490
There's any woman look better than a woman that a guy draws.

928
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:02.110
Um,
all right.

929
00:54:02.111 --> 00:54:07.111
Isis is a DC comic superhero as well as a separate Egyptian goddess also living

930
00:54:07.931 --> 00:54:09.400
in the DC universe.

931
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:14.730
The recent superhero character is modeled closely after the main character of

932
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:16.240
the secrets of Isis,

933
00:54:16.241 --> 00:54:20.380
a live action American Saturday morning television program that served as the

934
00:54:20.381 --> 00:54:23.110
second half of Shizam.
I remember that.

935
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.150
<v 4>Okay.</v>

936
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:25.470
<v 0>Shizam Isis hour,</v>

937
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:29.580
the television character appeared in the late seventies DC comic publication.

938
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.570
Yeah,
I remember this shit.
So that to me that,
that,
that's what it was.

939
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:38.280
Um,
all right.
Let me go back to your question here.

940
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:43.080
So a well as you know,
a few months ago after a few months after she was born,

941
00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:47.730
this stupid terrorist group who just so happens to go by the name Isis is all

942
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:50.850
over the news.
Isis is actually a beautiful name.
I shouldn't be making fun of it.

943
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.781
Um,

944
00:54:51.781 --> 00:54:56.340
I don't know all of the political aspects of the group and I really don't care.

945
00:54:56.341 --> 00:55:00.570
All I know is that a year later these people are still all over the news and

946
00:55:00.571 --> 00:55:05.360
don't seem to be going away anytime soon.
I don't know.
These terrorist groups,

947
00:55:05.361 --> 00:55:07.200
it kind of like boy bands,
you know what I mean?

948
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:10.440
They're fucking hot for a couple of summers and then they just kind of go away,

949
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:12.770
you know?
Like,
um,

950
00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:14.600
<v 4>okay.</v>

951
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.220
<v 0>But like,
like Hezbollah is like fucking the backstreet boys at this point,</v>

952
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.110
you know,
in Isis is like a,
not the Jonas brothers,

953
00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.960
Jonas brothers like Hezbollah,
right?

954
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.760
Oh,
the al Qaeda.
I'd say they're more like the al Qaeda and Isis is like a,

955
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:36.610
isis was the,
wherever the f those fucking people are.
Whoever the new one is.

956
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:37.990
Right.
That's who they are.
Okay.

957
00:55:37.991 --> 00:55:41.170
All I know is that a year later these people are still all over the news and

958
00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:44.650
don't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.
We tried ignoring it,

959
00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.230
but every time we have to tell someone our daughter's name,

960
00:55:47.231 --> 00:55:49.390
we either get a weird confused look.
Oh,

961
00:55:49.391 --> 00:55:53.800
we get someone who tells us she should start going by her middle name.

962
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.303
<v 4>Wow.
Okay.</v>

963
00:55:56.710 --> 00:56:00.280
<v 0>Who'd say that to a mother?
We have thought about,</v>

964
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:04.570
I guess I'm old enough that when I,
when I heard Isis,
when I heard that,

965
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:07.980
well just to let you know,
when I heard Isis,
the terrorist group,

966
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:12.960
I laughed at the name cause I was thinking like that's that superhero that was a

967
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:14.130
rip off a wonder woman.

968
00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.153
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

969
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:17.431
<v 0>Anyways,</v>

970
00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:21.420
we have thought about having her go by her middle name until all this blows over

971
00:56:21.421 --> 00:56:24.660
but she just doesn't look like anything than an isis to us.

972
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.540
So we decided that would be too weird.

973
00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:30.960
One solution we have thought of is to change your name to something that is

974
00:56:30.961 --> 00:56:35.430
similar to isis so she can still use the nicknames shortened version of our

975
00:56:35.431 --> 00:56:39.060
current name,
but we won't have the word Isis tied to her legally.

976
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:43.680
So my question is this,
do we have,
do we let everyone else win?

977
00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.650
I'll go through all of the legal and financial burdens of getting her name

978
00:56:46.651 --> 00:56:51.651
change or do we keep her name as it is now continued to put up with all the side

979
00:56:52.021 --> 00:56:53.550
comics and dirty looks and help.

980
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.060
Who would think that someone would name a little girl.

981
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:58.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

982
00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:02.930
<v 0>After a terrorist group,
what state do you live in and hope the terrorist group,</v>

983
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.230
Isis doesn't turn out into any bigger deal than it already is.

984
00:57:06.231 --> 00:57:08.990
Thanks to the advice and as always go fuck yourself.
Um,

985
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:13.310
I say you stand strong at this point.
That's what I say.

986
00:57:13.311 --> 00:57:15.350
I say you stay with the name.
It's actually a beautiful name.

987
00:57:15.351 --> 00:57:20.210
That's a beautiful name for a little girl.
Isis is a beautiful name.
Um,

988
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:28.150
I dunno.
I Dunno what to tell you.
You know,

989
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:30.640
cause then it's like,
all right,
so we are going to be stubborn and then

990
00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.750
yeah,
I will show you what a fucking situation,
cause then it's like

991
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:40.640
your kid's going to be young enough.
They'd be switch it.

992
00:57:40.641 --> 00:57:45.220
Now it's not going to remember,
but if you go too long,
that would be weird.

993
00:57:45.221 --> 00:57:49.630
If all of a sudden somebody changed my name to like chuck.
Hey Charlie.

994
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.180
Charlie.
Oh yeah,
that's right.
This my name.
Hey,
how are you?
What's going on here?

995
00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:56.140
That'd be weird.
Um,
yeah,
that's sucks.

996
00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:58.850
That's sucks.

997
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.300
And it also sucks that they're making isis out to be this huge fucking deal.

998
00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:04.190
You know what I mean?

999
00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:08.420
That we're focusing all these billions of dollars on this little ass fucking

1000
00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:13.130
group,
right?
And meanwhile,
over here,
you know,
you have people that took,

1001
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.160
took control of the food supply.
And from what I've read,

1002
00:58:16.161 --> 00:58:20.930
if essentially turned it into poison,
isn't that terrorist behavior right here?

1003
00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:22.910
He can't focus on that.

1004
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:26.450
You can't focus on bankers and all these fucking concept about that shit.

1005
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.221
I swear to God,

1006
00:58:28.221 --> 00:58:31.460
I don't understand why we can't just fucking build shit in this country,

1007
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:36.410
fix our own fucking shit.
It look,
you know,
electric cars,
you know,

1008
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:38.060
the batteries and shit that they're gonna do.

1009
00:58:38.061 --> 00:58:42.920
Just as much damage to the environment is oil and gas are,
you know,
they are.

1010
00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.430
But here's the deal,
if we do,
if we fucking switch over to that shit

1011
00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:51.020
and then we don't use oil,
they fucking go bankrupt.
And if they go bankrupt,

1012
00:58:51.021 --> 00:58:54.290
all these cons that are literally on our side can't fund the money into these

1013
00:58:54.291 --> 00:58:57.590
terrorist groups and then they fucking go away.
Right?

1014
00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:01.550
And then you can have a kid named Emma,
you know,
Hezbollah

1015
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.230
as he batting next,

1016
00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:12.140
Hezbollah Saunders his ball or soccer.
Um,
alright.

1017
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.080
Yeah.
So I don't know.
That's,
that's,
that's sucks.
I actually,

1018
00:59:15.081 --> 00:59:16.760
you know something I Kinda gave you shit in the beginning.

1019
00:59:16.761 --> 00:59:20.370
I actually feel really bad for you.
Um,
because you love your kid.

1020
00:59:20.371 --> 00:59:23.950
You love the name,
then that's all one thing.

1021
00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:28.510
<v 4>Um,
I don't know.</v>

1022
00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:34.620
<v 0>I don't think isis is going to be around too long.
I just think that they're a,</v>

1023
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:41.250
the two desperate,
you know what I mean?
The two desperate for attention,

1024
00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.180
just the shit that they're doing,
they're really kind of Hacky,

1025
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.810
cutting people's heads off light and people on fire.

1026
00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:52.560
It's always some sensational fucking thing.
You know what I mean?

1027
00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:56.790
Like if they were a comedian,
they would just be,
they'd have a catch phrase,

1028
00:59:56.791 --> 00:59:57.980
I feel like.
Oh,
they did.

1029
00:59:57.981 --> 01:00:01.500
They'd wear the same clothes every time they went on stage and the fucking,

1030
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:05.610
you know,
they did try and too hard to be evil.

1031
01:00:05.611 --> 01:00:09.420
I feel that they think they're actually going to,

1032
01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.250
they're going to last.

1033
01:00:11.251 --> 01:00:15.900
They fucking allegedly a man who knows once it goes through all the fucking

1034
01:00:15.901 --> 01:00:17.460
propaganda on all this shit,

1035
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:21.230
that person they threw off the roof was allegedly a gay guy and they were thrown

1036
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.190
off because he was getting just like fucking animals.

1037
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.890
I just don't think they're going to lie.
I think he,

1038
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:29.990
I think even they are too fucking insane to last is what I'm hoping.

1039
01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:32.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1040
01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:36.560
<v 0>You know,
and um,
I dunno,</v>

1041
01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:38.180
that's a rough one because I think my whole life,

1042
01:00:38.181 --> 01:00:42.080
I will remember the name has Bulla,
I will remember the name Al Qaeda.

1043
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:47.060
Will I remember Isis though.
I,
you know there's a big boy band out right now.

1044
01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:51.960
I don't know the name of it.
Oh Man.
That's a motherfucker.
I don't know.

1045
01:00:51.961 --> 01:00:55.170
I don't know what to tell you.
You know what?
I might have to phone a friend.

1046
01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:00.150
What do you guys think?
Let's take a vote.
All right.

1047
01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:03.150
You got three things.
Come up with a name for my southern tour.

1048
01:01:03.151 --> 01:01:05.130
Helped me come up with a name for my southern tour.
Should say,

1049
01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:08.970
help me come up with a name for the Thursday podcast.
Um,

1050
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:14.690
the Thursday,
Monday morning podcast.
Um,

1051
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.520
and to help this woman make this decision.
Ah,
that's fucking blows.

1052
01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:23.910
Imagine if you had a kid,
you just named them Eddie,

1053
01:01:23.911 --> 01:01:27.600
some regular name and then there's some new terrorist group over there and Eddie

1054
01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:28.860
somehow stood for something,

1055
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:30.893
<v 4>you know,</v>

1056
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:36.370
<v 0>eviction of,
you know,
fucking know in the Lopers except it worked with Eddie</v>

1057
01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:45.250
anyways.
Um,
any way shit.
Anyways,
uh,

1058
01:01:45.251 --> 01:01:46.630
so that's a podcast for this week.

1059
01:01:46.631 --> 01:01:48.880
Everybody came out right in about an hour this week.

1060
01:01:48.881 --> 01:01:51.430
I'm psyched that my Bruins is starting to play.
Well again,

1061
01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.790
you don't try to stay ahead of the fucking path is

1062
01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.430
<v 4>mmm,</v>

1063
01:01:57.930 --> 01:01:59.760
<v 0>I'm really a,
I don't know what to tell you.</v>

1064
01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.230
I'm actually thinking about that sports question again.

1065
01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:09.340
I would like to start an upstart league,
an upstart basketball league.

1066
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.960
There's just too many fucking teams already.

1067
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.110
I would like to do that and bring a team back,

1068
01:02:14.111 --> 01:02:18.550
have bring back like the Rochester royals,
you know,

1069
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:20.630
that'd be fun.
You know,

1070
01:02:20.631 --> 01:02:24.200
something actually thinking about that now that rethink this question.
Um,

1071
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:28.340
seeing how fucking awesome the fans are.
When I went to a Oklahoma thunder game,

1072
01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.560
is that right?
Is it the thunder?
I can't even remember some sort of weather.

1073
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.030
I don't watch hope.
Wow.
My brain is fried.
Um,

1074
01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.860
yeah.
Oklahoma City Thunder.
Yeah.

1075
01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.520
Just seeing how fucking awesome their fans were and just the stadium that they

1076
01:02:45.521 --> 01:02:47.500
built,
which was just bare bones.

1077
01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:50.650
Nothing crazy like the staple center in some of these other places.

1078
01:02:50.651 --> 01:02:54.040
And the place was so fucking loud because,
uh,

1079
01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.830
you don't have all that wasted space of luxury boxes and everything.

1080
01:02:56.831 --> 01:03:00.280
So it's really contained and it's like super loud.
Um,

1081
01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.370
I think it would be fun to,
uh,

1082
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.070
bring a professional team to a place like Rochester or something like that.

1083
01:03:06.071 --> 01:03:10.300
I think that it would be really bad ass now that I rethink it.
And A,

1084
01:03:10.301 --> 01:03:14.110
I'm psycho into fucking college hoops right now.
Um,

1085
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:18.740
and I actually kills me when I was in New York.
I didn't,
I,
I last second.

1086
01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:21.860
I looked up to see when Saint John's was playing in the game was already going.

1087
01:03:21.861 --> 01:03:24.320
It was down at Madison Square Garden.
Then it could have fucking gone.

1088
01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.730
A fucking bugs me anyways.
All right.
I'm,
I'm okay.

1089
01:03:28.731 --> 01:03:31.880
My came in like a lion and went out like a lamb,
by the way.
March 2nd.

1090
01:03:31.881 --> 01:03:34.930
This is my 23rd anniversary as being a standup comedian.

1091
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:38.750
Live in the dream coming up on a quarter century.

1092
01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:42.320
What am I going to buy myself for my 25th anniversary?

1093
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.260
Um,
all right.
That's the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.
Um,

1094
01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.860
I hope it doesn't keep snowing back east even though it makes me laugh,
but,
uh,

1095
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:56.450
that is it.
I will talk to you guys soon.
Uh,
rest in peace,
Leonard Nimoy.

1096
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.990
Um,
and thanks for the advice on smoking.

1097
01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:04.120
I will try to fucking quit a little bit.
You know,

1098
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.430
G G C..
