00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.910
Hey,
what's going on is filled bar and it's a Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:10.830
December 9th,
2013.
How you doin?
How are you?

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.700
How's your weekend?
How's your Christmas shopping?
Oh my God,

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.730
there's throwing people that buy four.
There's not enough time.

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.920
What am I going to do?
You know what you're gonna do.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.650
Just bake them a fucking cake.
All right?

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.690
You'll walk right up and you mush it right in the fucking cunt.
Happy holidays.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.110
Fuck all you.
You know,
that's the only reason why you like me.

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.590
You're going to judge me on my goddamn gifts leg.
Got a gift for you.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.280
It's right there.
You got frosting in your pubes.
All right.

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.280
Who else does that for you?
Nobody.
And now you know,

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.170
now you know who really cares about you.

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.850
I'm sorry.
I'm going to grumpy fucking mood.

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.270
I'm having a great time over here still.
It's still in Europe.
Um,
uh,

15
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
I'm in the Emerald Aisle,
Ireland.
I'm in Dublin,
Ireland tonight.

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
Hi Kay.
Tighty Tiki to,
uh,
just landed this morning.

17
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:03.510
I already called the opening Anthony guys to announced the second annual Patrice

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.560
O'Neal comedy benefit.

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.430
All of the proceeds goes to his wonderful family.

20
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:14.040
He's loving family and a,
we're also going to give some money for,
um,

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.730
victims of strokes.
It's just a great,
great benefit,
um,

22
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.660
that we're doing again this year because so many people wanted to come last year

23
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.740
we only did one show so people still want to come out and uh,

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.830
but also a bunch of other comics were like,
what the fuck bill?

25
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:32.130
How come you didn't ask me to be on it?
And I was like,
well listen,
you know,

26
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.210
I tried,
I did my God damn best.
All right,

27
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.140
so we're doing it again this year and I'm just going to keep fucking doing it,

28
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.220
uh,
hopefully as long as we can because that's what Patrice was doing when he was

29
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.270
taking care of his family.

30
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450
So where his friends and we're stepping up and Goddammit,

31
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
why don't you just help us step up by buying a fucking ticket?
Well,
we will belt,

32
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.583
but forest,

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.830
why don't you tell us about all the wonderful talent it's on the shell.

34
00:01:55.831 --> 00:02:00.000
Well God damn it.
I'm gonna.
All right.
We have the wonderful Jimmy Norton,

35
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.710
Nick Depaulo,
David,
Tell Collin Quinn Dane Cook talent,

36
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.790
myself,
Rich Vos,
Bonnie Mcfarland,
Keith Robinson,
Robert Kelly,
big J.

37
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.410
Awkward [inaudible] Harris.
Stan.
Okay.
You think there's a pet a show out there?

38
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.240
Well then God damn it,
you go to it.
But if you don't come on down Tuesday,

39
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.310
February 18th,
2014 tickets are on sale right now.

40
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:26.860
We'll have the link if you follow me on Twitter.
Um,

41
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.100
I got that up there already and it's for a wonderful,
wonderful cause and um,

42
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.730
it's becoming this great thing now or we're just going to be celebrating.
Um,

43
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.120
just our great friend and how funny he was in his unbelievable work and it's now

44
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.120
also becoming kind of like a reunion thing.
It's,

45
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:45.510
it's really become a great thing.

46
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:48.990
So we'd love you to come down and share the experience with us while raising

47
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:51.850
money for a wonderful costs.
They you go and,
um,

48
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.140
some of you have bitched to me going like dope.

49
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.620
Why is it on a fucking toes day?
You know,
I got school next day.

50
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.590
I understand that,
I apologize,
but you know,

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.460
if you want a great lineup of Comedians,
um,

52
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.450
<v 1>okay.</v>

53
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.811
<v 0>You know,</v>

54
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:12.460
to do what benefit Tuesday is the night when the most guys are in town.

55
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.140
Most people have gigs on Saturday nights and that type of shit.
Um,

56
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.270
so most people are out of town.
So Tuesday night is,

57
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.820
is the night I picked because you know as much as you want to go to this thing,

58
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.120
stand up comics want to be on the show because we all love the guy.

59
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:31.420
So that's why it's Tuesday night.
I know it's a bit of a pain in the ass,
but hey,

60
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.290
it's a god damn charity.
You're going to bitch about charity.

61
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.010
All the comics are working for free.
Okay,
so go fuck yourself.

62
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:40.910
One person who complained about that,
that it,

63
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.550
it annoyed me so much that I felt like I needed to address it.
All right,
Sarah,

64
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.660
we are now onto the podcast.
Oh my God.

65
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:53.890
The place is that banner.
Thank Dave.
Stayed.
I can't remember if I,

66
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.060
if I just did this on opiate Anthony,
but even if I told you about it last week,

67
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.890
I w I need to warn you guys.

68
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.940
I went and I saw the Sistine chapel.

69
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

70
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.830
<v 0>And it is the Sistine Chapel.
I thought it was the 16 as in one,</v>

71
00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:10.664
six.

72
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.320
And I was sitting there with the lovely Nia as we were standing in fucking line.

73
00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.870
That wasn't even that bad,
that bad,
because it was the winter time.

74
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.613
<v 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.140
<v 0>and basically this is the deal when you go in to the,</v>

76
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.030
the Vatican,
I guess the,
the,
the ass end of the Vatican.
Okay.
And I'm going to,

77
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:35.200
I'm going to really sidestep the easy joke there.
Okay.

78
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.540
With all due respect to all the victims,

79
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.150
when you go into the anus of the Vatican,
you have two options.

80
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:48.950
When you go into the Sistine Sistine Chapel,
you either go left,
you go right.

81
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.630
<v 0>Okay.
If you're wired like me,
go to the right,</v>

83
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.470
you'll go right into the Sistine chapel.
All right?
But if you're an unlucky,

84
00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:00.460
dumb cunt,
like myself,
you go,
Ooh,
right.
Left,
right?
Eh,
fuck it.

85
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:05.020
I'm going left and I went left.
And uh,
you go through the whole Vatican

86
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.870
<v 1>mmm.</v>

87
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.830
<v 0>Museum and within there they have every vestment,</v>

88
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.980
every fucking spatula,
every light bulb,

89
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.710
every fucking priest ever used.

90
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.150
And you're walking through it and it just keeps saying Sistine Chapel,
Sistine.

91
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.900
Even though I still thought it was 16 cause I'm a fucking idiot,
right?

92
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.800
So in every other room the ceiling is painted.
So you walk in,
you're like,

93
00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:36.630
is this it?
Is this,
is this,
this,
this date?
No,
no,
keep going,

94
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:40.230
keep going.
Basically by the time you get through all this shit,

95
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:41.260
you don't even care anymore.

96
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:44.640
And then you walk in there and it's ridiculously small.

97
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.950
It's not nearly as big as they make it look on TV,
don't.

98
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:50.340
And they make it look like it's,
you know,

99
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.320
would like take up the whole ceiling of your living room.

100
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:56.910
Just that one picture of God sort of a gingerly touching the other guy's finger.

101
00:05:56.911 --> 00:06:00.980
It,
it's just this little fucking thing that you could cut out of the ceiling and

102
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.430
put on your arm,
bring it to all your friends house.
One weekend.

103
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.600
Is that from this,
this 16 chapel Joe?
Yeah,
it is.

104
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.250
So,
uh,

105
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.120
and you know what's worse is once you get in there and then you look in and you

106
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.800
start going,
oh my God,
it's sent that pray with them.

107
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:19.070
You know what the fuck y'all all the guards who are standing there just sit

108
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.060
there.
Shushing people.

109
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.073
<v 2>Sure.</v>

110
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.620
<v 0>The whole time you're in there.</v>

111
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:28.720
And that's when the standup comic in me slash control free kicks in.
You're like,

112
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.020
right.
You know what?
Fuck you.

113
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:35.021
Fuck this stupid picture and you silly outfits from 300 fucking years ago.

114
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.040
All right,
you got every God damn thing in this museum IX,

115
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.450
you got every fucking shoe that'd be gold plated.

116
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:47.900
What are you got everything about the Catholic church in here except for the

117
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.260
rape murder and the fucking pedophilia.

118
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.630
<v 3>I didn't have the balls to say that because they're their own country.</v>

119
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.360
There are a sovereign state as they say.

120
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.440
So as much as I wanted to say that aside from Bousquet do,

121
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:09.590
I didn't have the balls to say that or the wherewithal to think of that in that

122
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:13.580
moment when I was being shushed.
Um,
I didn't know what happens.

123
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.700
Like what happens if you say something like that when you're on the Vatican

124
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:20.180
grounds?
Do they just kick you back into Italy?

125
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.981
You know what I mean?

126
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:26.330
Or did they take you down into some dungeon and basically treat you like they

127
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:30.630
treated a lot of little boys?
I couldn't resist.
Sorry.
Um,

128
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.040
that's great.
No,
a bunch of fucking Jesus freaks are going to know.

129
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.200
If you're a Jesus freak and you're still listening to this,
you're,

130
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:41.000
you're an asshole.
All right.
What?
You're an asshole.

131
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.070
You know what?
You know what I think.
Anyway,
so let's plow ahead.
So,
so I,

132
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:47.930
I mentioned I said 16 chapel to Nia.

133
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.800
What did I say too?
I said,
you know what?
This fucking line is so long already.

134
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.760
Forget about in the summertime.
So,
you know,
we should do,

135
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.990
we should open a bar across the street and I go,
we should call it the 17 chapel,

136
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.300
you know,
and she's looking at me like,
what are you talking about?
I'm like,

137
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.330
you know 16 chapel and the cross streets,
17 chapel,
you know,
you,

138
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.500
you get fucked up cause your feed a swung from standing in the line for so

139
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:18.550
goddamn long.
Did you just sort of cocked her head?
She's like,
Bill,

140
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.900
you've realized it's the Sistine Chapel.
You realize that.

141
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.960
And I just smiled at her and then she just started laughing at me just realizing

142
00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:30.930
what a fucking idiot that she's decided to spend her life.

143
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.800
And I'd love to tell you guys that that was just a joke that that's just a silly

144
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:43.920
fucking anecdote.
It isn't.
It's 100% fucking true.

145
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.420
I kind of knew it was 16 but it just became 16 in my head.

146
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:54.180
I have that same disease my dad has where for John Elway's entire career,

147
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:59.250
he called John on way and you'd be like dad,
Elway,
Elway and be like,

148
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.050
[inaudible] what does it I'm way anyways,
so this just this John on,
wait,

149
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:08.820
I'm telling you this guy,
he can run,
he can pass dad.

150
00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:11.850
It's Elway.
I heard it just,
no,
let me finish.

151
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.510
Let me finish this guy.
You know.

152
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.170
So I,
I think I inherited that from him.
I,
I don't,

153
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.440
I don't know if I don't hear well,

154
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.250
I'm so wrapped up in my own thoughts as Neil would suggest.

155
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

156
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.800
<v 3>But either way,
somewhere along the line,
if it came to 16 chapel,</v>

157
00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:33.020
to me that's his even makes sense to be the 16th.

158
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.590
Every time I think I've hit like the bedrock of my stupidity.
Right.

159
00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:43.820
Some else,
something else comes along.
Um,
anyways,

160
00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:47.720
but since then I have left Italy.
Sadly,

161
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.130
I left Italy.
Uh,

162
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.660
the food was fucking unreal and uh,
you don't kill me.

163
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.760
Oh Shit.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Little bit with this around here.
Oh,
is that,

164
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.060
is that my shirt?
Making all that fucking noise.

165
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:04.160
I thought that was just in my ear.
God dammit.

166
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.050
How about now?
Is that better now you can move around.
There we go.

167
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.510
I'm literally laying here with a fucking pad of paper under my recorder.

168
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.710
This is so stupid.
I Dunno.
I'm just,
I'm not funny sitting down.

169
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.720
I gotta be laying down or standing up.
All right.

170
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:22.880
And I'm not walking around for an hour and a half in a fucking

171
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.420
hotel room.
I can't believe all of that had that scratch or anything.

172
00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:29.650
I thought it was in the headphones.

173
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

174
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.150
<v 3>Thought there was a bug in there,</v>

175
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:34.760
like in star trek when they crawled into that guy's fucking year.

176
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.020
Remember they drop those little maggots in there.
It was terrifying.
Um,
anyways,

177
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:43.910
plumbing ahead.
So I leave at a,
and I fly up to,
uh,

178
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.280
I'm on my way to Glasgow,
so I have to connect in Amsterdam.
And as you fly up,

179
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.820
I saw the entire west coast of Italy who's insane and I just watched that World

180
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:59.180
War Two documentary and I was thinking of all that stuff,
you know,

181
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:04.181
the soft underbelly of the Nazi Europe and they came in here and rather than

182
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:06.260
going into this one part,

183
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:09.170
they came in the southern part and they had to fight to the fucking mountains.

184
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.900
And that's all I'm thinking.
And you look down and from the air,

185
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.620
so much of it like a,
it's really impressive.

186
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.740
Like even though I'm sure there's a zillion people over there,

187
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:21.380
like how much of it is still those green fields?

188
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.790
So when you look down it looks like World War Two,
um,
footage.

189
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.500
Except now it's in full color.

190
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.410
Like I half expected us to start dive bombing and strafing some poor bastard

191
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:37.490
trying to run into the fucking tree line and a,

192
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:42.400
you fly over the Swiss Alps and then right on up.
And uh,

193
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.870
I was just fucking incredible.

194
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.300
I haven't Goddamn face pressed up against the glass

195
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.720
like some eight year old on his first trip.

196
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:55.630
I really am a geek for this travel stuff,
man.
It's,
it's,
it's awesome.
So,
um,

197
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.090
landed in Amsterdam,
get all the way up to Glasgow connected,

198
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:05.770
no fucking problems,
no nothing.
And um,

199
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.670
people,
Scotland that they coolish they cool is how you show up.

200
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.230
The fucking lady checking me and was going to my show that night.

201
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.300
Or there's a guy checking me in,
but the other,

202
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:19.960
the other lady who was working there,
you know,
most countries should go into,

203
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.890
they're looking at you like you're a fucking terrorist.
You know?

204
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.780
Even though you look like Ron Howard,
they always go,
where are you staying?

205
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.540
I don't fucking know.
What are you going to call me?

206
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.290
And where I was staying in a fucking hotel.
How long are you here?

207
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.320
I'm here for a day.
Oh really?
Well,

208
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.960
he only here for a day for oh cause they're going to blow the whole fucking

209
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:44.800
place.
That what do you think?
Do you think I'm here for gates?

210
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.880
You see the sad clown in front of you?
What do you think I'm doing here?

211
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.770
Um,
just as pasty as you,
you dumb fuck.
Let me in your country.
Right then.

212
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:57.640
I liked that.
Then I liked that at all over up in Scotland.

213
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:00.670
They don't give a fuck.
You're like,
oh that step freckled cut.

214
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.500
I'm going to see tonight at the fucking the shit shack down the straight.
So,
uh,

215
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.730
anyways,
went down,
did the uh,

216
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.690
did the show work with this hilarious guy,
Gary Little opened up for me.

217
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.930
The guy was a fucking riot,
great guy.

218
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.770
And a afterwards I hung out with him and uh,

219
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.560
Kevin Bridges and a bunch of fucking,
you know,

220
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.290
drank whiskey,
Scotch,

221
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.080
whatever the fuck we were drinking and just had a great night talking comedy and

222
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:33.850
all that type of thing.
So,
uh,
I want to thank everyone who came out to that show.

223
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.460
It was just great,
man.
It was amazing.
Like,

224
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:38.830
seriously when I was on stage and like Scotland,
I didn't,

225
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.910
I didn't feel like I was outside of the United States except a couple of times I

226
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.660
set a couple of dumb things,
but uh,
you know,

227
00:13:46.661 --> 00:13:48.880
they thought they would get or whatever.

228
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.650
Making fucking baseball references stupid.
Right.
So that one went great.

229
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.000
Next day,
kind of had a little bit of a delayed flight,
flew down to Amsterdam.

230
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.900
That one was awesome at a bunch of people came in from Germany and Belgium

231
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.470
telling me I should do shows there so maybe I'll add those to the next time.

232
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.700
It was just awesome.
And uh,

233
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.210
actually spent an extra day in Amsterdam and I was trying to be mature enough to

234
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:17.680
not go down.
Sorry,
I gotta move this fucking thing.

235
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.130
I was trying to be mature enough not to go down to the red light district.

236
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.713
You know,

237
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.070
Maria across the street where I was staying from was the Vincent Van Gogh
Museum.

238
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:27.761
So I'm like,
all right,

239
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:32.761
I'm going to give museum another chance because I get anxiety when I go into

240
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:39.280
museums because I go in there and it's all this smart shit in there.

241
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.790
And I could give a fuck after the first exhibit.

242
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.430
Like I literally just want to run through the place and get out of there.
And um,

243
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.530
but I went to the Vincent Van Gogh One and I absolutely it,

244
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.150
<v 0>I loved that.
And for the first time I think actually appreciated art.
And I,</v>

245
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.690
and I hate to say this,
I think half of the reason was I went by myself.

246
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.630
There was nobody else there,
so I didn't have to,

247
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.560
I'm always like 20 miles ahead of anybody who I go to a museum with.

248
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.160
You know those fucking people you go to a museum with and they actually get the

249
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:10.994
fucking,

250
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.160
the headphones and the recorder and they just go from exhibit to fucking

251
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:19.910
exhibit.
They got to watch every God damn film

252
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.850
and I,
I don't,
I should respect people like that,
but I don't,

253
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:30.260
I hate them.
So anyways,
I went to the Vincent Van Gogh Museum.

254
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.210
It's insane.
They just have his paintings hanging on the fucking wall.

255
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.150
That just sound dumb.
I don't know.
It was always a zillion miles away to me.

256
00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:44.900
Right.
So I'm looking at him and as amazing as they were,

257
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:49.250
I was still in and out of there in 35 minutes and that includes going to the

258
00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:50.084
gift shop.

259
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.040
I walked in and the first thing I saw was he drew a picture of like,

260
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.880
he was taking this art class and he had to drop like a picture of like the

261
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:02.480
skeleton or something like that,
a painting,
draw a picture,

262
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.610
paint the fucking human skeleton.

263
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.190
So we painted it and in the end he put his cigarette and his mouth as like a

264
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:14.750
fuck you to his teachers.
So immediately I liked this guy.
I like this guy.

265
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:18.440
He's not some goody two shoes,
right?
Even Ganti saying these homework,

266
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:21.500
he's not that guy,
right?
He's the guy.

267
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:24.530
He's going to have to fake id and go get you some booze in the fucking late

268
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:29.480
1880s so I looked at all of his shit and I really liked it.
They go,

269
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.600
that's as deep as I can say.
I didn't really like his chalk period.

270
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.910
Please pay with chalk or whatever.
The black and white shit I wasn't into,

271
00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:42.530
but the thick paint with the lines,
I was into that.
It was great.

272
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:45.560
The further you step back,
the more it looked like,
what the fuck he was painting.

273
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.220
Then when he got up close look like a bunch of lines.
How do you do that?

274
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.960
You know,
he can't stand 40 yards away with a long paintbrush.

275
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.080
They didn't have that technology back in the 1880s.
They didn't,

276
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.590
don't even tell me they did.
You know,
they look closely at his paint.

277
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:03.590
He had a bunch of sand and leaves in it.
The guy was out of his mind.

278
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.960
The only thing I don't like is a,
he cut his ear off.

279

Although some people would say love is the most important thing in life,

283
00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:19.490

it's not worth,

284
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.123
<v 1>I dunno.</v>

285
00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.150

She like Mister Blonde and Marvin national at the same time.

292
00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:49.920
to say that I pretend to be stupid and um,

293
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.780
<v 3>I just started laughing.
I was like,</v>

294
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:53.940
if that person ever heard me try to read out loud,

295
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.190

361
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.503
<v 1>MMM.</v>

362
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.510
<v 3>What else did I want to talk about?
Oh,
when I was over in England,</v>

363
00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:58.010
I really saw this crazy story.
Um,

364
00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.070
but I went to London.
Yeah,
yeah.

365
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.333
<v 1>MMM.</v>

366
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.200
<v 3>They had a marine over there,</v>

367
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.170
guy named Alexander Blackman and he just got jailed for life,

368
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.230
for murder of an Afghany and surgeon.

369
00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.213
<v 1>Uh,</v>

370
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.780
<v 3>it's unreal.
Basically what happened was,</v>

371
00:22:18.781 --> 00:22:23.580
I guess they shot this insurgent guy and this guy,

372
00:22:23.581 --> 00:22:27.000
Alexander Blackman walked up to him.
Let me,
I gotta get the quote here.

373
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.050
What exactly did he say?
Oh,

374
00:22:31.051 --> 00:22:34.050
he just walked up to the insurgent as the guy was laying there,
I guess,

375
00:22:34.051 --> 00:22:37.950
wounded and he shot,
he shot him in the chest and said,

376
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.760
shuffle off this mortal coil.
Sorry.

377
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.090
Shuffle off this mortal coil.
You can't,

378
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.670
it's nothing you wouldn't do to us.

379
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

380
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.050
<v 3>And for some reason,
the fucking jerk off behind a mat of camera in his helmet.</v>

381
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.550
And they filmed that.

382
00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.320
So now Britain has to act like they don't care that he did that.

383
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.610
Now they have to act like they give a shit and that that's conduct unbecoming of

384
00:23:04.611 --> 00:23:06.800
a good fucking soldier.
Uh,

385
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.860
if anybody can find a four second moment in any war in history where that,

386
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:18.310
that doesn't happen,
you know,
that's talking about all on the other side.

387
00:23:18.311 --> 00:23:21.250
When they catch these guys,
when they catch y'all guys,

388
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.910
they skin them alive and cut their fucking heads off show as far as I'm

389
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:27.340
concerned.
That guy got off easy.
Fuck him.

390
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.790
Am I the only guy who saw it as saving private Ryan?

391
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.130
What apple would they let that guy go?

392
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:38.140
He came right back and started killing that guys just set them over there to

393
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:42.730
kill the other guys and evidently he didn't do it in the proper fucking way.

394
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.690
<v 1>Uh,
yeah,</v>

395
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.320
<v 3>he saved the British people money.</v>

396
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.800
You don't have to feed that guy porridge anymore.
Right?

397
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.860
It's war.
You train these guys to murder people.
He goes out,

398
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.330
he does his fucking job.
He murders this guy and now what?

399
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.940
Now you've got to act like you're outraged because it was filmed.

400
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.350
That guy got fucked over.

401
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.690
He got fucked over the same way the 49 is dead when they played the saints.

402
00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.270
Uh,
look,
I am not,
I don't,
I'm not pro war.
I'm not,

403
00:24:21.271 --> 00:24:23.190
but I'm also not a fucking moron.
Okay.

404
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.220
You can't train people to do some shit like that and stick them in those

405
00:24:29.581 --> 00:24:33.390
hellacious fucking environments where that really are no fucking rules

406
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.430
regardless of whatever convention Geneva Convention or whatever bullshit that

407
00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:41.010
you signed.
Give me a fucking break.
All right?

408
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:42.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

409
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.090
<v 3>I don't think what that guy did was,</v>

410
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:46.880
I don't even think within the context of war.

411
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

412
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.710
<v 3>I mean morally is it right or wrong?
Me Morally wars in right.</v>

413
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.190
I don't understand how I can,

414
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.580
if he's actually was pinned down and he fucking shot that guy in the head,

415
00:25:00.581 --> 00:25:03.490
they give him,
they give him a metal.
I don't know.

416
00:25:03.491 --> 00:25:05.220
That whole thing is fucking stupid.
They,

417
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.760
so the guy has to do at least 10 years and uh,
personally speaking,

418
00:25:09.761 --> 00:25:12.520
I hope they send them to,
I was saying this an opie and Anthony this morning.

419
00:25:12.521 --> 00:25:16.060
I hope they send that guy to the Goodfellows jail,
you know?

420
00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.240
Oh,
took,
don't put too many onions in the sauce.
Right.
Okay.
Now we can eat.

421
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.610
All right.
You know,

422
00:25:24.611 --> 00:25:27.340
it'd be great if everybody around the world just quit every army.

423
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.020
That would be perfect.

424
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.730
And then you just let these fucking nerds with their ties right in their beards

425
00:25:33.731 --> 00:25:36.940
and shit.
Just let them have it out.
Right.
There's a fucking hacky thought.

426
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.060
Am I writing the lyrics to a hippie sauce?

427
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.210
<v 0>Oh,
the loser.
Proud.
Sorry.</v>

428
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.790
Oh fuck.

429
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.250
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

430
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.250
<v 0>Oh my God.
This is fucking tour.
Let's talk is going to be the death of me,
man.</v>

431
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.530
I swear to God.
No,
it is.
I'm want to tough,

432
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.890
tough my way through it because I just read the fucking knew Bobby or book

433
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.370
highly recommended,
highly recommended.

434
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.190
I'm thinking of everything he said in that book,
and it's keeping me going.

435
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:06.380
I'm just focusing on tonight's game here in Dublin.

436
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:10.040
I'm not thinking about how I have to fucking connect in a fro.

437
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.850
One more fucking time,
all the way over to Goddamn Helsinki.

438
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:14.990
I'm not thinking about that shit.

439
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:19.490
That fucking flight might as well be 20 years in the future.
That's bullshit.

440
00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.600
I wish.
I wish I believe in that.
Um,
anyways,
what else?

441
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.570
Well,
I guess I just brought up NFL football.

442
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:28.460
I did not watch a second of it yesterday.

443
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:32.030
I'm on the other side of the planet and uh,
I don't know.

444
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.440
When I was doing was trying not to get sick,

445
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:37.400
I guess I've been eating like shit and uh,
although I did get some,

446
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.840
I got some friendly emails from some Cleveland Brown fans notifying me that the

447
00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:46.800
Patriots won.
Uh,
here's one.
Hey,
you red haired.

448
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:50.670
Fuck.
Uh,
I haven't you guys exhausted the red haired angle.

449
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.760
This so many other things about me that are stupid looking that you could make

450
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:58.280
fun of.
You know,
Jesus Christ enough with the fuck.
I get it a day.

451
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.070
A red balls.
I've only fucking times,
you know,

452
00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:05.850
I got a gigantic forehead.
You know,
I'm not going to help you guys out.

453
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:10.740
You figure it out.
You're one trick ponies.
All right.
Hey,
read.
Yeah,
you read head.

454
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.380
Fuck.
Hope you're proud of the Patriots.

455
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:16.500
Win nothing like cheating all day to get what you want.

456
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.720
Tom Brady's is sissy piece of shit.

457
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.630
Oh God,

458
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.260
I don't understand how people watch NFL football every week and they don't see

459
00:27:28.261 --> 00:27:32.100
what's going on and they start blaming the other team.

460
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.230
You know,
didn't you see when the Patriots played the fuck in a,

461
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.580
who the hell do we play there?
We end of the gallery of k.

462
00:27:40.581 --> 00:27:43.390
Remember we played that fucking game and the end of the game?
Uh,

463
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.730
they didn't call the interference.
I mean,
how is everybody

464
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.210
fucking league loves to a breed.

465
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:53.740
He gave me nude fucking these patient adherence cools you fucking full sheet

466
00:27:53.741 --> 00:27:58.330
blue.
It's,
it's,
it's happening to everybody.
All right.

467
00:27:58.331 --> 00:28:00.460
You stupid fuck browns fan.

468
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:06.150
Did you notice that the NFL settled out of court?
Did you notice that?

469
00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:10.630
That they settled out of fucking court to those,
those fucking,

470
00:28:10.631 --> 00:28:12.970
those hits?
Do you understand that?
Do you understand that?

471
00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:14.380
They're all about making money.

472
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.063
<v 2>Okay.</v>

473
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.060
<v 0>If drew Brees is out,
if Tom Brady is out of Peyton manning is out,</v>

474
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.590
they lose fucking money.

475
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.030
So they are ridiculously protecting all of those quarterbacks.

476
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.480
And like in all sports,
the stars will get even more calls.

477
00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.660
All right.
You Dumb Brown cuts.
Okay.

478
00:28:37.661 --> 00:28:40.900
And as far as the pass interference calls,
if you're mad at that,

479
00:28:40.901 --> 00:28:42.310
don't get mad at the Patriots.

480
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:47.440
Get Get mad at Jim or say and Peyton manning who bitch Moan and complain and

481
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.790
then fucking Rsa spearheaded changing the rules of coverage.

482
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.970
You combine that with the fact that the NFL has hit their saturation point where

483
00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.600
there's no more sports fans left to watch the NFL,

484
00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.530
so now they have to get people the casual fan of the person who doesn't give a

485
00:29:05.531 --> 00:29:08.920
fuck.
Okay.
If you don't give a fuck about the sports,

486
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.650
that's the sport that you know is on in the background.

487
00:29:11.651 --> 00:29:14.410
The way to get people's heads to turn his scoring,

488
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.480
so everything is about scoring now.
Okay.

489
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.350
That pass interference call when I was growing up was called coverage.

490
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.570
That was great coverage two years ago or a year ago,

491
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.190
maybe two and a half years ago.
That was great coverage.

492
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.110
Now that's considered pass interference.

493
00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.560
It's absolutely fucking ridiculous.

494
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:40.780
It's a travesty I've said every week on this fucking podcast than it used to be.

495
00:29:40.781 --> 00:29:44.950
The thing to do and bay in,
in professional sports in America anyways,

496
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.060
is to hit the curve ball.
Now it is trying to cover a fucking receiver.

497
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:50.783
<v 2>All right?</v>

498
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:56.260
<v 0>You can't it,
you can't hit him anymore.
You can't touch them.</v>

499
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.180
You can basically run next to them.

500
00:29:58.181 --> 00:30:00.880
But I think you have to hold your breath because you're not even allowed to

501
00:30:00.881 --> 00:30:04.660
breathe on with this fucking point.
And now they got this thing,
you know,

502
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:05.860
you can no helmet to helmet.

503
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:10.000
So now they hit low and now guys like Gronkowski just got his knee blown out

504
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.110
because the other guy in Cleveland like two years,
two years ago,

505
00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:17.440
that would have been a dirty hit.
Why did he hit him so low now?

506
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.700
Because of that settled out of suit thing.
You can't,
you know,
helmet the helmet,

507
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.910
uh,
had settled on a court thing.
It came fucking talk.
I'm so jet lagged,

508
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.460
they got to go low then all you fucking constantly internet.

509
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.320
Who's sitting there saying that Gronk Kowalski's made out of glass.

510
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:34.060
That's just so really,

511
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.840
you could take a defensive back going full speed into the side of your knee.

512
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:44.030
You can handle that.
You fat fucking cunts.

513
00:30:44.031 --> 00:30:47.770
I'm glad your dreams didn't come true.
How do you like that?
That's right.

514
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.240
I came with no gloves,
no gloves on.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

515
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.960
I can't even speak this fucking week.
What else did I see?

516
00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:00.940
A rose Rosebowl tailgate legend,
that awesome fucking comedian,

517
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:03.890
uh,
Joe Partner and asked me if I saw the Bruins penguins games.

518
00:31:03.891 --> 00:31:08.830
So I actually watched some of the highlights of that and uh,
you know,

519
00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:13.840
that was very out of the,
uh,
out of character
by,
uh,

520
00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.290
Sean Thornton.
I don't obviously don't condone that.
I don't think he does either.

521
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:22.140
I don't know why he did that.
You know,
I know Marshawn just got hit more Shan,

522
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.190
however the fuck you supposed to say it now.
Uh,
but yeah,

523
00:31:26.191 --> 00:31:29.730
I don't condone that either.
Although I did find it funny.
All the penguins fans,

524
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.600
not Joe,
but the other one's talking about dirty heads,
you know,

525
00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:36.150
as they look the other way with the absolute fucking

526
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.380
<v 2>okay.</v>

527
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.710
<v 0>Just some of the filthiest talking people ever have played for the penguins and</v>

528
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:46.260
they just look the other way.
You know,
Matt Cook,
I'll Sam Samuelson,

529
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.141
all of those guys,

530
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:51.580
the amount of fucking careers those cuts ended and none of the penguins fans had

531
00:31:51.581 --> 00:31:54.340
any problem with it.
They got old Samson in their ring of honor.

532
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.800
Now I'm going to bitch about Sean Thornton and I'll,
uh,
fuck.
Uh,

533
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:00.700
but having said that,

534
00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:03.640
I don't condone whether it happens to my team or my team's doing it.
That's,

535
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:08.440
that's,
that's dirty play,
you know,
and he should be punished.

536
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:12.040
Uh,
but I mean,

537
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:13.820
it's the only time I've ever seen him do something like that.

538
00:32:13.821 --> 00:32:17.240
Now if he does it again,
then he's a dirty piece of shit,
which I know he's not.

539
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.190
Gonna.
All right.
Um,
all right,
with that,

540
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.780
what else can I talk about?
What should I do here?
Overseas sports.

541
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:31.130
I went to a premiere game,
Premier Football League game yesterday.
I went to,

542
00:32:31.131 --> 00:32:34.160
I said,
no,
first average,

543
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:38.930
and then I guess arsenal was heavily favored and uh,
it was an incredible,

544
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.130
it really was the,
um,
I guess the club itself,

545
00:32:45.131 --> 00:32:49.840
I guess you would call it a,
I don't like naming names on the podcast,

546
00:32:49.841 --> 00:32:54.480
but a,
they hooked me up with tickets through the promoter.
And um,

547
00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.330
we sat basically the best seats in the house,
like the club seats,

548
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.830
the leather seats.
They gave me a little blankie for her,

549
00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.950
went out there in case I got cold.
I took a picture of it with the Hashtag cozy,

550
00:33:05.951 --> 00:33:09.940
smug cunt.
And uh,
I went out there and it was,
it was great.

551
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:15.070
Listen to everybody's singing the songs and shit.
But if,
if I lived in England,

552
00:33:15.071 --> 00:33:19.450
I would definitely pick a team and I would go to the pub and learn all the songs

553
00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.650
and then I would go sit in the upper deck because who wouldn't want to get shit

554
00:33:23.651 --> 00:33:27.460
faced?
Standing up the whole game singing songs.
It looked great.
So anyways,

555
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.360
it was zero,
zero or nil,
nil.

556
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:35.020
The exact fucking reason why Americans do not watch soccer or football,

557
00:33:35.021 --> 00:33:38.260
whatever the fuck you want to call it.
And then finally,

558
00:33:38.261 --> 00:33:42.310
but it was still beautiful fucking game to watch.
It really is.

559
00:33:42.311 --> 00:33:46.150
It's a lot like cocky to be honest with you.
Except there it's,
you know,

560
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:50.230
it's on grass.
Long story,
short arsenal,

561
00:33:50.231 --> 00:33:55.231
finally fucking scores and the whole stadium breaks into this song about

562
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.630
arsenal.
Uh,
I dunno,
they have,
again,
it gets back in the day.

563
00:33:58.631 --> 00:34:02.260
They used to always win one to nothing.
They go,

564
00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.320
they score one goal and then like a bunch of cuts.
They just would,

565
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.310
I'll go back on defense and you couldn't score on them as the whole crowd would

566
00:34:09.311 --> 00:34:12.040
sing this song in a one nothing arsenal and you,
you know,

567
00:34:12.041 --> 00:34:14.470
you got to fucking lose and all this shit's so anyways,

568
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:18.370
so they go up one nothing with like two minutes left and they all start singing

569
00:34:18.371 --> 00:34:20.260
the song,
the whole fucking stadium,

570
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.410
except for this one little corner that was for Everton.

571
00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.770
And they get into the second verse,

572
00:34:26.771 --> 00:34:30.610
doll places singing and they got their scarves out.
Hold it up,
going nuts,

573
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:36.340
big glow in fish and chips,
looks on their faces having a hell of a fucking time.

574
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.190
And when they're in the middle of the second verse average and scored,

575
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.460
Oh did it take the wind out of their fucking sales?

576
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.480
They went to the average that people are going fucking insane.

577
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.320
Somebody lid off like a little smoke bomb that had this blue smoke.

578
00:34:55.321 --> 00:34:57.870
That was the cover of Everton,
I guess you're not supposed to do it.

579
00:34:57.871 --> 00:35:02.490
The cops all came running over and uh,
I dunno,

580
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.690
they just told him to knock it off in America.
They would drag like two rows out,

581
00:35:06.691 --> 00:35:09.090
beaten with clubs.
But uh,

582
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.660
and then all the blue smoke just kind of went all over this one part of the

583
00:35:12.661 --> 00:35:16.890
stadium and that's how it ended one to one.

584
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.290
And I had a great fucking time and a,

585
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:23.340
I highly suggest it if you are highly recommended,
if you come over to England,

586
00:35:23.341 --> 00:35:27.330
you definitely got to go.
Ah,
you got to go to one of those,
one of those games,

587
00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:29.970
premier league games.
It was fucking tremendous.

588
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:35.220
And I planned on going into many more and uh,
hopefully in the future.
But,
uh,

589
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.830
this is something that I found that was interesting was,
um,

590
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.570
all the maniacs go does the soccer games and the rich countries go to rugby.

591
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.810
Who would've thought,
right?
The posh cons as they call them,
go to rugby,

592
00:35:49.811 --> 00:35:51.670
I guess in England.
That makes no sense to me.

593
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.610
I would think that rugby would be like,
is it like an elitist sport?

594
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.460
I get that.

595
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:05.120
I was even talking to the cab driver this morning was I'm going in Ireland.

596
00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:06.090
He was going,
yeah.
A lot of people,

597
00:36:06.091 --> 00:36:10.430
they go on to become doctors and something like that.
Like those guys do.

598
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.390
I don't fucking know.
Is this,
is this even remotely?
Fuck it.
I would say any,

599
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:19.030
I have no idea.
I've been on a plane every fucking day for the last four days,

600
00:36:19.031 --> 00:36:23.170
so I don't know.
Uh,
what else?
How far into this podcast?

601
00:36:23.171 --> 00:36:25.870
I always a time for the,
how are we going?
Not yet.
Not yet.
Oh,

602
00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:30.100
Jesus Christ Robinson.
Robinson Cano got traded.
He traded,

603
00:36:30.101 --> 00:36:34.780
he signed with the Seattle fucking mariners for more money.

604
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.860
Why would,
why would you do that?
Well,

605
00:36:39.861 --> 00:36:43.230
how would you go for playing second base with the New York Yankees?

606
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.320
He's going to get $190 million.
No,

607
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.890
240 million.
I'm going to go play for the Seattle fucking marriage.

608
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.850
What the fuck are the Seattle mariners thinking,

609
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.190
given up all that God damn money.

610
00:36:57.191 --> 00:36:59.110
Then they learn anything from the Texas Rangers.

611
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.160
Give it a $200 million contract to a fucking shortstop.

612
00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:07.250
You're going to give a tour to $40 million contract or a second baseman.

613
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.900
You know I didn't rub it in with Paul Versey.
I know he's fucking devastated.

614
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.620
He was trying to say,
I'm not mad at him.
You know,
he's got to take the money.

615
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.030
It's a difference of $50 million.
I get it.
I get it.
Yeah,

616
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.430
I need to get it.
That is a total slap in the face of the New York Yankees.

617
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:25.880
<v 2>Okay.</v>

618
00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.970
<v 0>What?
I'm supposed to happen to the Yankees,
you know?</v>

619
00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:30.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>

620
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.330
<v 0>I Dunno.
Good on the Yankees to fuck him.</v>

621
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.050
Don't pay him on a fucking $190 million and he leaves.
Go ahead,
leave.

622
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.920
Go out to Seattle.
I have a good time losing Robbie.

623
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:43.670
Um,
yeah,
I don't think he's going to do shit out there.

624
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.430
Although Seattle's talking a bunch of shit.
You know this,
well,

625
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.600
we're not done yet.
We're going to,
we're going to over pay for even more people.

626
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.250
Um,
she what the Yankees created and then the red sox supported.

627
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.630
Oh,
by the way,
big congratulations to the Seattle Seahawks fans for once again,

628
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.500
screaming mindlessly,
Eddie crowd screaming meter.

629
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.660
Whatever the fuck you doing out there.
Uh,

630
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.800
congratulations on the plaque that was awarded to you that you'll probably have

631
00:38:12.801 --> 00:38:15.690
for like another two weeks before somebody else decides they're gonna.
Yeah,

632
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.120
break the record.
Is any crowd failed yet?

633
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.740
Will they set their minds to screaming for the sake of fucking screaming?

634
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.490
He does have a lot of Seahawks fans think that I'm shitting on their team.

635
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.870
I'm not,
I have money on you Khan to win the Superbowl.

636
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.620
In fact,
if you guys do not win the Superbowl year,

637
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:40.030
I feel it's a monumental failure because I don't see anybody else in your way

638
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.100
who is in your way.
Nobody.
It's yours to fucking lose.

639
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.380
You got the best God damn defense in the NFL.
Defense wins championships.

640
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.480
You think you can't handle Peyton manning?

641
00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:54.563
<v 1>Huh?</v>

642
00:38:55.610 --> 00:39:00.350
<v 0>And that fucking hat box,
head of his,
actually he got to be wearing a top half.</v>

643
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.470
You could put a top hat on his head and it would like,

644
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.040
you could just pull it all the way down.

645
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.600
The Brim would be resting on his shoulders.
So what does that mean?

646
00:39:08.601 --> 00:39:10.580
Bill is not a good quarterback.
Now it does it.

647
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.070
It doesn't mean he's not a good court.
That's a hell of a point in just made.

648
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.440
I am.
Can I really just for one week,
just not shit on Peyton manning.
Um,

649
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.720
anyway,
I think you guys are going to win it,

650
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:25.300
but that's stupid loudest crowd thing.

651
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.890
I swear to God and I,
and in my heart of hearts,
I know this,

652
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.180
that real Seattle Seahawks fans were there at the game.
They don't participate.

653
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.990
I know they don't.
The same way when I go to a red sox game,

654
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.710
I don't sing sweet Caroline.
I don't buy the pink hats.

655
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.340
I don't buy any of that horseshit.
I don't even wear a red sock shit.

656
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:49.960
Now when I go to a fucking game,
it's gotten so ridiculous.
So

657
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:54.610
that's stupid.
Loudest crowd record.

658
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:59.590
What it should be done is secretly they should be recording crowds.

659
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.320
If you really want to figure out which one is the loudest,

660
00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.610
if you're going to throw out the acoustics of the building inside versus outside

661
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:09.730
versus stadiums,
deliberately designed to be louder.

662
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:11.903
<v 1>MMM.</v>

663
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.210
<v 0>Because if you tell everybody and people were coming down there with those</v>

664
00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:16.830
fucking bull horns,

665
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:18.643
<v 1>all right?</v>

666
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.620
<v 0>They Seattle fence fucking grow up.</v>

667
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.733
<v 1>Okay.</v>

668
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:28.980
<v 0>Keep Your Ryan the price.
They'll blow out your voices.</v>

669
00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:32.370
You got to win the Superbowl this year.
Okay.
Then you can scream and yell there.

670
00:40:32.371 --> 00:40:33.204
What are you going to do?

671
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.410
Try to break your own record and give yourself another fucking plaque.

672
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.030
Oh,
everybody gets a ribbon.
Um,
all right.

673
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.350
That's my little cunty fucking bullshit for this week.
Uh,
what do we got here?

674
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.950
Let's continue on with some,
uh,
some emails for this week.
Fuck.

675
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.820
Am I getting a cold that Jesus Christ,
a little facts for the podcast.

676
00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.410
Hello,
Bill.
How are you doing?
Uh,

677
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.190
I was at your show in Amsterdam last week and it was a great show.

678
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.250
Hope you enjoyed your time at hall.
And I did.
I had a great time.
Oh,

679
00:41:05.251 --> 00:41:09.210
I didn't mention,
I tried not to go down to the red light district,

680
00:41:09.211 --> 00:41:13.860
but I had to do it,
you know,
how do you not look at hookers in windows?

681
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.490
It's unreal.
So I went down there by myself,

682
00:41:17.491 --> 00:41:20.340
like a total fucking creep and uh,

683
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:23.803
I looked at him

684
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.780
and it's a,
it's fascinating and sad and all of,

685
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.960
and I actually saw one guy walking out when I was across the street and shit.

686
00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:40.130
And it's just like,
that guy just fucked a woman,
paid money and fucked her.

687
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.270
It's just the most bizarre thing ever.
But they're a,
they're really good looking,

688
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.010
you know,
as far as like a woman you got,

689
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.940
that was one unbelievable fucking gorgeous woman and she was so good looking.

690
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:56.270
She wasn't even looking out her window.
She was just sitting at a little desk,

691
00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.350
you know,
just like,
look,
you know,
you want to fuck me?
No,

692
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.320
you take your money out and knock on the door.

693
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:07.110
But I'm not going to stand here at the fucking window.
All right,

694
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.930
let's fucking recording keeps moving around here.
Um,

695
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:12.500
<v 2>okay.</v>

696
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.890
<v 0>And I also saw a skating rink when I was out there and they were playing this</v>

697
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:19.370
fucking insane music and say was skating around?

698
00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:20.760
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

699
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:25.500
<v 0>Almost like this polka music.
I got to upload the video.
I swear to God.</v>

700
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.190
All of that shit just sounds like Hitler youth music to me.
I don't know why.

701
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.060
Let me see if I can play some of this for you.
I'm trying to find this video.

702
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.380
I sent it to everybody.
I knew it was called it Hitler on ice.

703
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.440
Hope you can hear this.

704
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.390
So this shit's going on is people are skating around.

705
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.110
I just came upon this walking by myself and Amston.

706
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:52.903
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

707
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.780
<v 0>Oh God.
Sorry.
Anyways,
let's get on with this thing.
I said,</v>

708
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.150
where are we?
Anyhow,

709
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.970
I wasn't sure if you're being sarcastic when you stated Holly didn't have

710
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:13.250
slavery.
I wasn't.
I didn't think you had,

711
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.980
I didn't think you guys had slavery and a bunch of people corrected me.
Oh,

712
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:20.840
that's right,
because I was in the,
all right,

713
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.270
let me set this up right before I read this email.

714
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:28.770
Basically I was in Holland on December 5th and that was,
uh,

715
00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.620
I guess that Santa Claus is birthday.

716
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

717
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.560
<v 0>Not In Holland,
I guess just officially.
That is Santa Claus is birthday.</v>

718
00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:41.420
Santa Claus was a legendary led,
allegedly Jesus bill,

719
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:46.420
allegedly a real person.
They don't know where he lived at all that.

720
00:43:46.421 --> 00:43:49.660
It's very Jesus like,
but allegedly he's a real fucking guy.

721
00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.200
December 5th is when he was born and they celebrate by dressing up like Santa

722
00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:01.600
Claus and essentially putting on blackface.
But it's supposed to represent,

723
00:44:01.601 --> 00:44:05.290
he's gone down every chimney in the city.
So he's got sit all over his face,

724
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.780
you know,
and as Neil was saying,

725
00:44:07.781 --> 00:44:11.590
so would it be sort of strengths rather than put all over their fucking face?

726
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.290
It's black face.
So I was asking them about it and go,
well,

727
00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:21.070
you guys not doing it like an offensive way.
I mean,
you guys didn't have slavery.

728
00:44:21.071 --> 00:44:24.850
Right?
And they had this day at this big laugh.
And I thought that,

729
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:30.340
oh no,
they,
they all in like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
And I thought they meant like,
no,
no,
no,

730
00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:34.530
we're so against,
don't put that shit on me.
I guess.
Uh,

731
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:38.130
I guess I was wrong.
So here we go.
Here are the facts.
Uh,
he goes,

732
00:44:38.131 --> 00:44:41.010
since you are like me most of the time,
pretty unformed.

733
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.390
It could be that nobody told you that shifts from Holland transported about half

734
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:49.740
a million slaves during the transatlantic slave trade in the 17th century.

735
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.240
I check this shit out at Wikipedia,
so it must be valid.
That's hilarious.
He goes,

736
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:58.320
actually the slave trade was one of the reasons that Holon flourished in the

737
00:44:58.321 --> 00:45:01.680
golden age as we call it.
So yeah,
we did play a role in this,

738
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.000
not really part of our history.
We're proud of,
uh,

739
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:09.180
you might ask yourself why I wrote a to tell you this.

740
00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:11.850
It's because I'm a con likes to tell people they're wrong.

741
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:16.350
I don't think you're a con.
I think that's great that you informed me of that.
So,

742
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.160
so they go all righty then.

743
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

744
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.060
<v 0>Well,
why would they go up like that?
Well,</v>

745
00:45:23.061 --> 00:45:26.180
I guess because they couldn't make it diagonally across some Africa.
Right.

746
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.550
Although if he goes straight across,
she kind of,

747
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.140
<v 2>okay,</v>

748
00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.160
<v 0>where are you at this point?</v>

749
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:32.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

750
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.200
<v 0>You went straight across.
She'd be like in Aruba,
maybe north of that.</v>

751
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.950
I don't fucking know cause a mill.
I'll bill,
you know,

752
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.980
do you have to reinforce every three minutes?
How dumb you are on this podcast?

753
00:45:44.981 --> 00:45:48.780
I'll fuck you.
Fuck you with you,
with your brain.

754
00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.100
Um,
oh,
this is a reply to that 22 dating 16 year old.

755
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:58.560
Oh No,
it isn't.
Is it or is it a reply to it?

756
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.540
Anyways,
a few weeks ago somebody wrote in and was saying that my eh,

757
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.530
same way he was 22 or whatever,
I forget,
I'll fucking old.
He was all,
he knows.

758
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:11.760
His 16 year old sister was dating a 22 year old.
What should he do?

759
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.640
Uh,
so I think somebody is responding to that.

760
00:46:14.641 --> 00:46:19.110
I'm guessing because it says re 22 dating 16.
Uh,
okay.

761
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:24.140
My Dad started dating my mom when he was 22 and she was 15 gross.

762
00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:31.350
Um,
his dad told him he could get in trouble and advised him to stop.

763
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.510
My Dad told him no,

764
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:38.340
it is legal as the age of consent is 14 or something here.

765
00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.730
Yet,
you know,
when you're fucking somebody that that young,

766
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:46.130
you probably want to be a little more specific.
No,
it is it,

767
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.050
the legal age is like 14 or something,

768
00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.120
40 16,
whatever.
Split the difference.

769
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:58.590
She's 15 and then you fucking arrested.
He said anyways.
He said,
uh,

770
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.600
they ended agreeing,
uh,
they ended up agreeing to go ask a lawyer.

771
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.150
Whoever was wrong,
had to pay.

772
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:11.130
My grandpa paid the lawyer fees and my parents have now been married for almost

773
00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:15.960
30 years,
but if some 22 year old wanting to date my 15 year old daughter,

774
00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:19.740
I wouldn't have it.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Absolutely.

775
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.340
I don't even think that that's a great thing that your parents stayed together

776
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:24.174
like that.

777
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:27.900
Did your mom even get to see what was out there before she ended up with your

778
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:30.610
dad?
Jesus Christ

779
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.890
first restaurant she walks into.
She's just like,
this is the best food ever.

780
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:40.570
It's never going to get any better than this.
I guess that's good for you.
Right?

781
00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:44.380
So you don't feel like your mom's a whore,
but why would she be a whore?

782
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.170
Why can't she go out and do what guys do?
I'll tell you why,

783
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.280
because,
well,
what would we do?
What it takes skill.
If I mentioned that before,

784
00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:00.610
this podcast,
a guy getting laid,
that's a skill.
All right,

785
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.160
a woman getting laid.
It's just gluttonous behavior.
It's not even this.

786
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:04.723
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

787
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.870
<v 0>Where is the challenge?
There is none.</v>

788
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:14.810
You can out of the fucking bar right now and have a entire bar on one if you

789
00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:16.550
wanted to.
Right?

790
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.450
What is impressive as a woman,
you know for guy,

791
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:25.210
if you get a two on one that's like,
you know the fucking brass ring.

792
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:27.480
What is impressive for a woman?

793
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:31.460
What are you gonna have like a 15 on one and what is impressive about it that

794
00:48:31.461 --> 00:48:36.430
she could fucking physically take it?
Oh Jesus.
Bill.
That was just,
wow.

795
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.980
That was a whole nother level of ignorance.
All right,
let's,
let's plow.

796
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:43.380
Let's just plow ahead after that fucker.
One 48 minutes in a,
uh,

797
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.100
Billy [inaudible],
Billy Red Corp Coppola,
Francis Ford Coppola,

798
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:50.520
Billy Red Coppola.
All right,
I'll go with that.
Uh,

799
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.950
are you going to check out any foreign films while you're overseas?
Dude,

800
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:55.690
I can't even read advertising.

801
00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:00.340
Do you think I want to fuck a watch a film having to look up and down like I'm

802
00:49:00.341 --> 00:49:01.870
fucking texting while driving.

803
00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:05.380
The earliest thing I want to do that listening to my stuttering voice in my
head.

804
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.180
Uh,
you gotta check it out.
Any foreign films while overseas?
I suggest you do.

805
00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:14.050
It's a trip.
Seeing the cultural differences.
I lived in London and France.

806
00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:17.230
It would check them out from time to time in case you don't make it.

807
00:49:17.231 --> 00:49:19.350
Here's what you're missing.
A test,

808
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:25.540
a derivative,
Benny Hill style slapstick,
derivative money,
python,

809
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:30.100
dryness,
derivative theater,
drama,
the occasional deck and more tips.

810
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.190
Some of it's great though,
so maybe you'll get lucky.

811
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.160
I don't know what any of that means.

812
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:39.640
I guess there's a lot of tits occasionally show somebody deck and they do a lot

813
00:49:39.641 --> 00:49:43.750
of Monty python,
Benny Hill type humor.
Well,

814
00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.280
I've already seen the originals.
You know,

815
00:49:45.281 --> 00:49:46.540
why the fuck would I want to go see that?

816
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:48.520
Thank God I have something better than that,
don't they?

817
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.820
What are those fancy films that comes out at Cannes?
Zed Con Film Festival.

818
00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:59.920
Wrath of Khan.
Uh,
all right,
Bill.
Where's Lenny Bruce?
Bill,

819
00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:04.820
I'm not a standup comic.
I'm not even a huge comic Geek.
I am,
however,

820
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:09.400
a freedom of speech Geek and comedians are the most important people when it

821
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:12.340
comes to this.
So why aren't comics who,

822
00:50:12.341 --> 00:50:16.450
for the most part operate independently louder about what's going on?

823
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.950
I just read about a blog by a girl bashing Kurt Metzger.

824
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.950
I don't,
oh,
he's fucking hilarious.
Uh,
he goes,
uh,
I didn't know who he,

825
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.650
but I looked him up and he's really funny.
He makes good points about that stuff.

826
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:35.480
The blogger just completely labels him a completely labels him things he's not

827
00:50:35.481 --> 00:50:37.670
just because she can understand his context.

828
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.120
You are outspoken about this and I've been honest when asked,

829
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.070
but why aren't people louder?

830
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.750
They were just speaking very vaguely louder about what bloggers bitching about

831
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:51.890
comedy or bitching about social issues.
He goes,

832
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:54.740
I don't mean to single out so and so or so and so,

833
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.700
but they're in big positions to speak out against the stifling of the art.

834
00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:02.540
It doesn't anyone want to go down as the guy who stepped up and articulated what

835
00:51:02.541 --> 00:51:05.120
they believe.
It doesn't have to be malicious,

836
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.600
but with some charts and graphs you could explain it to people.

837
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:13.130
Like that Blogger Jim Norton debated.
I was just going to bring Jim Norton up.

838
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.110
Yeah.
That they're missing the point.

839
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.613
<v 1>MMM.</v>

840
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:22.470
<v 0>Well,
you know,
there is also you,
you kind of hope it just goes away.</v>

841
00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.830
If you talk about it,
then they get like more hits.

842
00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.910
It's really just like a lazy reporting.
Um,

843
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:35.370
I saw when Jim debated that blogger or come out show,

844
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:36.690
uh,
what the hell was it called?

845
00:51:36.691 --> 00:51:41.040
They're a totally biased and uh,

846
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:45.250
you know,
I thought she was,
you know,

847
00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:46.960
for all the ignorance that she was,

848
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:48.880
<v 1>yeah.</v>

849
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.880
<v 0>Talking about like the general terms with which she defined standup comedy and</v>

850
00:51:54.101 --> 00:51:55.600
Comedians and all that.
Like,

851
00:51:56.610 --> 00:52:00.100
especially talking about how angry comics where I thought it was really ironic

852
00:52:00.101 --> 00:52:04.090
that she was sort of the epitome of all of that and she seemed very angry.

853
00:52:04.091 --> 00:52:08.290
She spoke very generally about standup and really had no idea what she was

854
00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:10.990
talking about.
And um,

855
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.610
I thought I said that.
Did I say that on the fucking podcast?
I don't,

856
00:52:15.611 --> 00:52:20.020
I don't give a fuck about,
look,
if somebody wants to go to a comedy club,

857
00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:20.890
I've said this before,

858
00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:24.550
if they want to go to a comedy club and take a comedian seriously,

859
00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.580
they are well within their right to do that.

860
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:32.910
But just because they decide to take a comic seriously does not mean that that

861
00:52:34.571 --> 00:52:39.571
comic now like meant what they said in the joke.

862
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.110
It doesn't make the joke not a joke anymore just because someone decided to take

863
00:52:44.111 --> 00:52:45.220
it seriously.
So,

864
00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:47.243
<v 1>mmm.</v>

865
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.050
<v 0>I can only speak for myself.</v>

866
00:52:49.051 --> 00:52:52.740
The only reason why I don't talk about it because I think it's silly

867
00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.570
considering all the other shit that's going on.

868
00:52:56.571 --> 00:52:58.190
And then also to sit there and act like,

869
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.700
I can't remember the last time I heard a rape joke.

870
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:06.530
Like to sit there and act like that's what's going on.
I mean,
I,

871
00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:10.540
I don't,
I don't fuck it.
I that the,
I've already talked about this.
So,
uh,

872
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.300
you know,
where's Lenny Bruce?
That's the navy of thing.

873
00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:18.970
That's a Lenny Bruce moment to fucking say that.
I mean,

874
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:21.220
I guess what you're saying with the freedom of speech,

875
00:53:21.221 --> 00:53:23.860
but the bloggers have freedom of speech.

876
00:53:23.861 --> 00:53:28.320
They have the freedom to get pissed off about it.
And uh,

877
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.320
I don't know if anything,
they're probably helping comedy.

878
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:36.380
Maybe a lot of rapists wouldn't come down to the comedy clubs because they

879
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.050
didn't think that there'd be any humor for them.
You're not when,

880
00:53:39.051 --> 00:53:42.800
it's just nice to know that there's enough comics out there that have the

881
00:53:42.801 --> 00:53:46.820
brilliance to understand that rapist before they're caught.
You know,

882
00:53:46.821 --> 00:53:49.610
they like to laugh too.
So there you go.

883
00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.300
Everybody makes out alright.

884
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:55.760
Accidentally dating a high school chick day or bill,

885
00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:01.190
wait a minute.
Accidentally dating a high school chick.
All right,
it can happen.

886
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.060
She's super hot.
You're so psyched.
She's just going to blow you.
You know,

887
00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:09.470
she looks older than her years.
I'm already making excuses for this guy.
Uh,

888
00:54:09.471 --> 00:54:13.730
I'm a 24 year old expatriate Australia that now lives in Europe.

889
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.010
It's every bit the sexual buffet,

890
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.550
that teen titty comedies of the 80s promised.
All right,

891
00:54:19.551 --> 00:54:22.960
this is already getting creepy cause you said accidentally dating a,

892
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.950
a a a highschool chicken.
You just use the word teen.
Okay,

893
00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.700
that seems so,
it doesn't seem so accidental.
One sentence in,

894
00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:36.530
please don't be creepy and continuing.
However,

895
00:54:36.531 --> 00:54:41.531
I've recently started dating a certain lady and she's that in every sense of the

896
00:54:42.441 --> 00:54:43.660
words,
smart as a whip.

897
00:54:43.661 --> 00:54:46.750
Caustic is hell and yet warm when you're both alone together.

898
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:50.650
So here's the backstory.
I've been here a few weeks.
I arrive at this,

899
00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.180
at this House party.

900
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:56.140
I don't even make it past the front hall and I meet this girl.

901
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:59.740
Everything goes great.
We Hook up and we've been dating for a few weeks.

902
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.500
Fast forward a bit and she breaks off plans,

903
00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.950
casually mentioning that she has to study for her.

904
00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.330
He writes it in this other language,

905
00:55:08.331 --> 00:55:12.800
the rough equivalent to the American sat sats that don't get me wrong,

906
00:55:12.801 --> 00:55:17.410
the subject of school has come up.
Example,
what subjects was she interested in?

907
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.660
Et Cetera,
et cetera.
However,
this is where the language barrier,

908
00:55:20.661 --> 00:55:21.920
it can be a bit of a bitch.

909
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:26.210
The Germans and the French can also refer a university as school.

910
00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:30.380
And I naturally assumed she meant university back home.

911
00:55:30.381 --> 00:55:35.140
We graduated 16 to 17 years old.
Oh,
oh gee.
Gee.

912
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.690
So to bring this thing full circle of wondering what,
uh,
I'm wondering,

913
00:55:40.691 --> 00:55:43.860
do I bring it up,
break it off with this chick.
Wait,
dude,

914
00:55:43.861 --> 00:55:45.120
you didn't even say how old she was.

915
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.160
Germans or the French also referred to university.
His school.

916
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:50.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

917
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:55.150
<v 0>And I naturally assume she meant university.
That code.</v>

918
00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:58.130
We graduate 16 to 17 years old.
So how old is she?

919
00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.380
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

920
00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.960
<v 0>Uh,
what are you doing dude?
You don't tell me how old she is.</v>

921
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:07.080
All right,
I'll continue with it.
So to bring things full circle.
I'm wondering,

922
00:56:07.081 --> 00:56:08.340
do I break it off with this chick,

923
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.220
which I think can be a dick move,

924
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:17.520
given that we've already had enough explorative sex to make HBO look like Dora

925
00:56:17.631 --> 00:56:22.070
the explorer and it's a lever now would look like I've been leading her on slash

926
00:56:22.071 --> 00:56:26.980
using her or do I stay with her and risk our relationship becoming strained by

927
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:30.640
the different cultural gap?
For example,
uh,
for example,

928
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.930
she's dealing with the high school shit that I've long since resolved myself.

929
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:40.000
The essentials.
I liked this girl a lot.
We've got a lot in common literature,

930
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:41.170
arts,
sports,
booze,

931
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:45.760
and she doesn't find the fact that I collect pre seventies playboys.

932
00:56:45.761 --> 00:56:46.594
Creepy.

933
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:47.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

934
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.620
<v 0>A huge fucking plus given the woman I've dated.
Oh,</v>

935
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.330
do what the f when did I start attracting like sex offenders.

936
00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.680
So you have this weird collection of porn.
You're not telling me how old she is

937
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:04.250
because she's in high school,
still lives with their parents and his French.

938
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:09.200
They can be temperamental as fuck dude.
How old are you?
Oh,
he's 24.

939
00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.130
What is the age of consent and how old is she?

940
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:17.980
I don't know what you're saying here,
sir.

941
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:27.310
How old is she?
I'm not commenting on that.
Do what I need.
I need numbers.

942
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:33.000
Uh,
right,
right back dude.
Right back.

943
00:57:33.001 --> 00:57:35.520
Let me know how old you are because I don't know what the fuck you're asking me

944
00:57:35.521 --> 00:57:40.470
there.
Um,
anyways,
is that,
oh,

945
00:57:40.471 --> 00:57:43.860
I gotta I gotta do the other half of the fucking goddamn reads here.

946
00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:48.360
That'll maybe I'll tell you a quick little story or something for your bedtime

1047
01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.900
that London thing,
you know,
I already know.

but those amazing,
great crowds and everything.

1051
01:04:34.821 --> 01:04:38.840
And then London just as far as like just all the American comics that have come

1052
01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:42.710
over and gotten their breaks in London,

1053
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.240
you know,
from the bill Hicks's to uh,

1054
01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.840
Patrice O'Neil and um,
I dunno,

1055
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.760
that was really definitely a s a special,

1056
01:04:52.761 --> 01:04:56.390
that was one of those weekends as I was doing it.
I was,

1057
01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:01.220
I was like really nervous before the shows and shit.
Like,
um,

1058
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.880
I did not,
I'm not taking any of this trip lightly and this has been an amazing,

1059
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:09.790
just an amazing thing,
man,
to be able to go all through Europe here.
And uh,

1060
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:13.220
I know I'm only here for like a day and that type of stuff.
But,
uh,

1061
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.960
this is the beginning of many,
many,
many tours for me over here.
And,
uh,

1062
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.320
I'm hopefully going to be saying the same thing about Australia.

1063
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:23.800
I know it got Canada coming up in March and a,

1064
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:26.050
I just want to thank everybody who's been coming out to the shows and I've had a

1065
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:30.220
bunch of standup comics overseas coming up to me and that's like the biggest

1066
01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:31.850
compliment you can get.
People,
uh,

1067
01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.650
comics coming out to shows and coming up and saying that they actually liked

1068
01:05:34.651 --> 01:05:39.440
what you do.
So it's really cool.
And uh,
met a bunch of cool fans too.
Um,

1069
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.360
they had a couple people where the hell wasn't someone night in London.

1070
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.210
Somebody actually got me a cigar,
which is great.

1071
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:48.780
Please don't bring me any more cigars because our,

1072
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:51.490
I'm trying to cut down on that habit,
but I got to thank this dude.

1073
01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:55.390
Jimmy came and gave me a cigar.
Uh,

1074
01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:59.380
it's just been great meeting the fans and that type of stuff and people getting

1075
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:02.600
the DVDs and shit.
So a,
so really nothing funny.
I just want to,

1076
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:04.720
I'm only halfway through this tap way tonight.

1077
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:09.580
I just want to thank everybody who came out and,
uh,
it's been great.

1080
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.420
I'm too fucking immature to reach shit like that.

1081
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.290
I'm sure you have wonderful chocolate covered berries.
All right.

All right.
You can go fuck yourselves.
