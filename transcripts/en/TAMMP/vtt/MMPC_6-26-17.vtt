00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
Hmm.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.</v>

3
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:07.890
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
June 26,

4
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.460
2017 what's going on?
How,

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.003
how you doing?

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.820
How are you doing this fucking Monday morning?

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.360
God is global warming and making your raw fish hot.

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.560
Um,
climate change.

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.610
Let's give it a nicer name.
So

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.760
what are we going to use?
F was a euphemism.
Photosynthesis.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.960
Jesus Christ,
the,
the photosynthesis fucking police.

12
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.000
There's nothing people enjoy more on the internet other than jerking off to

13
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:54.320
people sold into the sex industry.
Sex slow.
What do they call it?

14
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.250
A human trafficking is fucking,
um,

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.920
correcting somebody.
Jesus fucking Christ.

16
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:03.980
The amount of gold I give you half God for fucking bid.

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.300
<v 1>A pasty fucking dope.
Like me.
Make some mistake every once,</v>

19
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:12.850
every fucking five minutes on a podcast.

20
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.270
All you fucking cunt cannot wait to go on the Internet and just read me the riot

21
00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:23.840
act like,
like Europe or some sort of fucking award.
And in,

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.090
in the science industry,
you know,
whatever the fuck they call it,

23
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.460
the science circuit.

24
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.680
So they always call a radio guy.
Say that yacht day.
Yeah.
Yeah.

25
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.730
We are working the circuit.
You mean doing the road?

26
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.310
I didn't realize there was a circuit.
Um,

27
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.190
everybody fucking common at me.
Photosynthesis Yard.

28
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.000
I think you met Paula nation laughing my ass off.

29
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.230
You know Jesus fucking Christ.
Let me leave and let me look it up right now.

30
00:01:56.231 --> 00:02:00.880
Paul [inaudible].
Dot,
dot dot.
Dot.
Paula nation.

31
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:04.600
Why is I've ever been a ball player named that pollination is the process by

32
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:08.770
which pollen is transferred to the female reproductive organs of a plant.

33
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.810
Thereby enabling fertilization to take place.
Like all living organisms,

34
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.010
seed plants,

35
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:19.160
ever singer may single major goal to pass their genetic information onto the,

36
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.050
all right,
well how the fuck does it get there?
Well,
it's pollination.
Oh,
I see.

37
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.070
I said photosynthesis.
All right,
so that's what I thought photosynthesis was.

38
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.820
Okay,
here we go.
Photo synthesis.
That doesn't have a good spring.

39
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.380
Paula nation
photo

40
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.750
<v 3>whoa</v>

41
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.930
<v 1>synthesis.
That's how you have to bring them up.
Now.</v>

42
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:43.390
Batting number 22 Oh

43
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.660
<v 3>oh</v>

44
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.020
<v 1>this is,
that's more like the MMA</v>

45
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.470
fighting out of the red corner.

46
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.560
You can see that.
Guess what?
We would just read definition

47
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.800
<v 4>fighting out of the red corner,</v>

48
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.920
the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight.

49
00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:04.754
It's a design,

50
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.130
<v 1>um,
from carbon dioxide to water and water.</v>

51
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.340
The process by which green plants in some other organisms,

52
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.750
you sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide,

53
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.410
carbon dioxide and water.
What does synthesize me?

54
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.410
See this is what happens.

55
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.610
Are they using auto tune synthesize,

56
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.020
s y s y s sort of synthesize.

57
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.090
You know what I meant?
All right.
Sin.
Sin,
the SIS synthesize.
All right.

58
00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:45.890
The combination of ideas to form a theory or system.
Well,

59
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.550
that doesn't sound like the definition.
They were looking for synthesis.

60
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.530
Synthesis.

61
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.420
<v 1>Oh,
come on.
You fucking cunt.
Plural.</v>

63
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:59.250
Synthesis to formation of a chemical compound through the combination of a

64
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:00.780
simple compound of elements.

65
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.090
See Multi you guys that knew that I used the wrong word.

66
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.370
You couldn't fucking tell me what all this shipment.

67
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.420
You don't unless you own a lab coat,
right?

68
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.790
Photosynthesis.
The process by which green plants and some of the organism uses.

69
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.820
Use Sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water,

70
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.680
like digest them and turn them into something edible.
So some con right now,

71
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:26.030
like you,

72
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.863
<v 4>yeah,</v>

73
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.560
<v 1>shut up.
All right,
there you fucking beaker redone.</v>

74
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.990
Can't fuck you when you're black framed glasses.
All right.

75
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.820
Least I own my work.
Unlike you and the science industry,

76
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.550
who owns your shit and what do they use it for?

77
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.940
You're out there trying to feed plants using sunlight,
right?

78
00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:49.940
And all of a sudden they come up with a new way to send our magic.

79
00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:53.420
Mike says what?
I'm starting to call our missiles,
Magic Mike's.

80
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.940
That's what we have in this country.
We,

81
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:58.790
we got the top of the line fucking missiles,
you know,

82
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.920
like the Mercedes and the Ferrari's in f one top of the line.

83
00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:08.060
We got the magic Mike's.
We shoot them into city a only kill the bad people,

84
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.940
right?
Then all these terrorist groups,
they like the fucking,
uh,
the,
uh,

85
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.470
who's the guys in the orange cars this year,

86
00:05:15.471 --> 00:05:19.220
that fucking cars blow up every God damn fucking race.

87
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.680
One of the Goddamn drivers,
cause you know what?
Fuck you guys,

88
00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:22.550
I'm taking a race off.

89
00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:27.440
I'm going to go drive the Indy 500 he left Formula One to drive a fucking Indy

90
00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:30.560
five,
either an Indy car race in America,

91
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.090
the Mclaren Honda.
It's their like the terrorist group.
You know what I mean?

92
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:38.270
You don't know what the fuck's going to happen,
but we got the magic mix.

93
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.900
Magic bikes,
photosynthesis,
um,

94
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.580
Paula nation,
whatever you guys got me.

95
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.910
I'm the fucking,
what's that guy?

96
00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:53.430
[inaudible] the Guy Yardi you said blow me like a cello or whatever.

97
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:56.820
I don't think I've ever related to a rapper more in that moment,
you know,

98
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.960
is as I am.
That's what it took.
You know,

99
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.540
not talking about this and talking about that.

100
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:06.560
It's the fact that dead poor bastard.
Dot.
A cello was a wind instrument.

101
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:07.281
I was like,
you know what?

102
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.940
This sounds like the kind of person that I went to summer school with and you

103
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:13.190
know what?
I bet he has other talents.

104
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.410
<v 1>Other than being able to memorize all you fucking cons out there where they were</v>

106
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:21.020
able to memorize what photosynthesis was versus Paula nation.

107
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.690
Can I ask you a question?
Seriously.
In all seriousness,
this,
where did it get you?

108
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.490
Huh?
Other than getting to be some content,
a cocktail party,

109
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.870
you know,
what are you as social life,
you can talk photosynthesis and fashion.

110
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.100
Um,
you know,
by the way,
thank you for correcting me.

111
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.500
I don't know how it's going to affect my life,

112
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:46.660
but there was just something about the joy that people took him in and

113
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.960
correcting me that I,
I took umbrage with that.
I use that correctly.

114
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.680
Or is that the wrong you word?
You know what?

115
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:56.920
You know what I like about Twitter is I don't even have to read anymore.

116
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.320
I'll just say shit that I think is right and you guys can correct me.
All right?

117
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:03.900
I'll learn things.
You guys can feel better about yourselves.
You know,

118
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:05.470
at dad tickets say Yah,

119
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.190
it's a little fucking do they call a little surf and turf.
So to scratch my back,

120
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.030
I scratch your back.

121
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.410
I Dunno what you see book Beyonce says she's got a Gig at the fucking Hollywood

122
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:22.480
bowl.
That was probably what?
A fucking talented family,
you know what I mean?

123
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.930
That's how talented that family is.

124
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.740
Like she can't even get anybody to look at her at the Thanksgiving table because

125
00:07:28.741 --> 00:07:32.490
they're fucking oldest sister sold out the rose bowl.
You know what I mean?

126
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.060
She's like the fuck up of the family cause she only sold out the Hollywood bowl.

127
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.930
Honey,
honey,
honey,
quiet down.
Quiet down.

128
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.080
Your sister is talking about what it was like to be singing bootylicious as the

129
00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:55.950
stealth bomber flew over the stage.
Okay.

130
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.980
Um,
was that wrong to do that?

131
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:06.180
Speaking of pollination,
will this get the beehive after me?

132
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.860
Yeah.
It was funny about all of those fucking groups.

133
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:13.130
This so up the ass of the artist.
I swear to God she would fucking,

134
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.830
she wouldn't take her God damn shoes off to run across the street and make it

135
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.870
fucking emergency call on one of those old telephones back in the day.

136
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:22.310
Let's just say there wasn't cell phones.

137
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.010
If she saw one of you guys sit on the side of the road,

138
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.030
she would give a shit about you.
What's another one?

139
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.770
Who's another one's got a big following,
you know,
that was it.

140
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.370
It's the beehive

141
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.480
as it Mariah Carey have one.
You know what I mean?

142
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.580
I don't know what it is.
It's just,
I dunno what,

143
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.540
there's something about acting like a complete asshole and treating people like

144
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:51.490
shit that just women can't get it up a certain type of woman.
They can.

145
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:56.300
They can't get enough of it.
What is it?
Why?
You know,
something

146
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.640
<v 6>I always wanted if,</v>

147
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.940
if more women were like Rhonda Rousey of the current champion that I don't know

148
00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.420
the name of,
my apologies.
Um,

149
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.880
if more of them took like MMA could actually beat the fuck outta you,

150
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:12.840
would they just not walk around being mean to each other as much,
you know,
guy,

151
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:15.790
I think that's the only reason why guys aren't as mean as women are because

152
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.180
personally speaking anyways,

153
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.080
because I know that 90% of guys can beat the shit out of me.
Right.

154
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.100
At the very least land,
a couple to my,
you know,

155
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.910
and I fucking bruise like the Irishman.
I am,
you know,
stop the fight,
you know,

156
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.630
two punches in.
I don't need that shit.
So I tried to basically,

157
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.930
you know,
mind my ps and qs.
What does that stand for?
High.

158
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.920
You're fucking brainiacs.
Um,
what does it stand for?
Let me find out.

159
00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:43.221
Like you know,

160
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:47.660
and I have to fact check everything so I don't get fucking get people at my ass

161
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:48.920
again.
Mine.

162
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.760
<v 1>Your p's and q's minding your ps and qs.</v>

163
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.220
P n Q origin

164
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.990
or is it yeah,
it's PS and qs.
Not P and Q.
Mind your p's and q's.
You fucking cunt.

165
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.730
How do you not say that without you fucking cunt.

166
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.213
<v 5>Okay.</v>

167
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.370
<v 1>What does mind your p's and q's come from?</v>

168
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.840
This is going to be a very special educational podcast.
It's just going to be me.

169
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.500
All right.
Okay.

170
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:22.990
If you've ever been told him mind your p's and q's,

171
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.510
it might have struck you as a rather odd thing to do.

172
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.070
Well that's a nice way saying it was annoying.
I think anytime soon we say,
hey,

173
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:34.490
mind your p's and q's.
I,
my immediate thought was,
who the fuck is this guy?

174
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:37.880
<v 5>Okay,</v>

175
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.860
<v 1>tell me to mind these things.
Uh,</v>

176
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:43.660
I won't sit some eighties comedy telling me to mind these things.
Uh,

177
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.050
the concept seems reasonable enough,
behaving,
behaving well,

178
00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:50.840
not giving offense,
but quite,

179
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.490
but quite what the letters p and Q have to do with this is a little more

180
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.310
mysterious.
Why not B and d?
O Jesus.
Here's something.

181
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.700
Why not be a,

182
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.120
can you just fucking get a whole entry?
All right.

183
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.000
<v 5>Okay.</v>

184
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.470
<v 1>Yeah,
there's a whole fucking,
this guy's just,</v>

185
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.320
you know what some funny about these fucking assholes who write for a living.

186
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.090
They just can't get to it.

187
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.150
They feel if they don't take up a whole fucking page or bill,

188
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.640
maybe there's people out there that enjoy reading.
Maybe it's sad.
Okay,
I'll,
I'll,

189
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.870
do you know what?
I'll take the ride.

190
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.220
Why not be in d or m and m m n n or any other combination.

191
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:31.811
Sadly,

192
00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:36.430
as it often is the case with the more intriguing terms in the English language,

193
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.850
there is no definitive answer to the,
Oh,
well what the fuck?

194
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:41.520
<v 5>Okay.</v>

195
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.480
<v 1>No one knows what it means.</v>

196
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.330
This last meeting were like Trenton,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

197
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.500
<v 5>Okay,</v>

198
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.600
<v 1>mean queen and not queen.</v>

199
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.240
<v 5>Okay.</v>

200
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.590
<v 1>What the best possible manners.
Mind your dancing.</v>

201
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.430
I Dunno.
The Oxford dictionary doesn't even know the answer.

202
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.360
You know what's funny?
They don't even have the fucking answer yet.
They still,

203
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.940
they still couldn't.
They couldn't keep their mouth shut.
Could they?

204
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.330
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

205
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.700
<v 1>I bet somebody else has one.
Somebody at this point see Internet.</v>

206
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:16.780
Somebody's going to take a guess.

207
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.720
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

208
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.121
<v 1>All right.</v>

209
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:24.110
What does it mean ever been told to mind your p's and q's every yes,

210
00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:25.070
yes.
That's why I'm here.

211
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.940
What's your working in mechanical printing press at the time?

212
00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:34.200
Chances are you are fairly subtly being told to mind your manners,

213
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.940
but what exactly are your p's and q's?
The short answer is no one really know

214
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.530
why is it that?
Why?
Why is it dead right there?
Mind your p's and q's.

215
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:48.480
What does it mean?
And then boom,
nobody knows.

216
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.960
<v 5>Okay.</v>

217
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.360
<v 1>What,
what kind of a fucking ass you ever been told to mind?
Your p's and q's?</v>

218
00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:57.900
Well,
you work in a printing press.
Fucking two paragraphs.

219
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.450
You know what I did is because this is delving into the world of people that

220
00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:05.810
like to know shit.
So even when they don't know shit,

221
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:09.950
they still have to fucking write three paragraphs on it.
All right?

222
00:13:09.951 --> 00:13:13.580
Fuck all of this.
Fuck all it.
There's,
I was just frustrating.

223
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.610
Um,
anyways,
and I am actually,
no,

224
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.840
before I looked up those things before I remembered that you guys corrected me.

225
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.620
You know,
maybe you guys weren't being assholes.
Maybe just trying to help me out.

226
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.440
You don't snakes,
I'm hanging around a socialite,

227
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.063
<v 5>you know,</v>

228
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.910
<v 1>social,
as far as I can tell,
it's just a way,
well,
red gold digging whores,</v>

229
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.620
you know,
like how did you get there?
You got to be married to somebody rich.

230
00:13:39.621 --> 00:13:41.900
If you just Wa,
if you just pleasant to be around,

231
00:13:41.901 --> 00:13:44.120
you don't really have a fucking job.
I mean,
somebody is going to be bring,

232
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.540
bringing home the Bacon,
right?
Bringing home the Bacon.

233
00:13:48.541 --> 00:13:52.710
Where did that come from?
You know,
I mean unless you're,
unless you're a farmer,

234
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.390
I don't know.
You let you your work in a,
unless you're a butcher,

235
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.110
I was 20 fucking paragraphs.

236
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.580
A later point is nobody really knows.
Um,

237
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.650
anyways,
I'm actually uh,

238
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.680
relieved believe it or not because I did the big Papi roast on a,

239
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:14.881
what was it,

240
00:14:14.881 --> 00:14:19.881
Thursday night and thank Christ it went about as great as it could have gone.

241
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.680
I am not a big fan of doing rose.

242
00:14:22.681 --> 00:14:24.930
You know what the last roast I did was I did the portray.

243
00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:29.760
So Neil roast like 15 years ago or something.
Whenever the hell that was,

244
00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:30.630
that was the last time,

245
00:14:30.631 --> 00:14:33.570
cause I never understood doing one unless you were friends with the person.

246
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.463
Right.

247
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.480
But I always like is always see guys like Lenny class it dead.

248
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:44.100
And uh,
Dennis Leary,
uh,
you know,

249
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:47.310
they're always hanging out at red sox games,
getting up in the broadcast booth.

250
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:49.560
And I'm like,
I would love to fucking do some shit like that.

251
00:14:49.561 --> 00:14:53.510
I need to do more Boston shit.
So this thing came up and I'm like,
ah,

252
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.810
why did it have to be a roast?
And Nia chimed in.
She's like,

253
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.140
so I said,
yes,
I'll do it.

254
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:06.500
Then I had no time to fucking right cause that was dealing with a bunch of other

255
00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:10.940
shit.
And uh,
all of a sudden it was a few days away.

256
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.290
And um,
I dealt with that race,
that race,

257
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.480
that roast the way this country dealt with a y two k,

258
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.090
you know what?
We waited until the last second.
Then we were like,
oh my God,

259
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.090
what are we going to do?
Like we treated it like a fucking giant term paper.

260
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:30.550
That's what I did.
Um,

261
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.750
and it was a wraith to Thursday when I was trying to say a race to the finish

262
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:39.810
line,
a race against time.
Um,

263
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.450
and I actually figured out how my brain works when it comes to those fucking

264
00:15:45.451 --> 00:15:48.220
things.
It's the same way it works for Standup,

265
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.690
but for some reason you think like a roast.
I have to sit down and write jokes.

266
00:15:51.691 --> 00:15:55.290
That's not what I needed to do.
I needed to put my daughter,

267
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.170
I had to put my daughter in the stroller and walk around the block.

268
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.440
And then I had to,
uh,

269
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.500
I smoked a cigar by myself on the back porch and I just kept thinking of shit

270
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.990
and I would just videotape myself saying it.

271
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.790
And then I had all these videos and I forget if I told you this guys,

272
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.390
you guys this on a,
Oh,
sorry,
on Thursday,

273
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.990
but I just watched the videos and I just spliced together every good one,

274
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.720
just transcribed them.
And then I had the block of everybody,

275
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:35.070
right?
I had poppy Gronk,
Pedroia,
Josh Wolfe,

276
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.450
Lenny Clack,
Sarah Tiana,
Anthony Mackie,

277
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.990
and everybody that was on the fucking thing and I just would put them underneath

278
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:47.723
each name.

279
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:53.050
And then I just then made a new document and I just took the best of the best,

280
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.450
slid him over,
then I put them in the best possible order.

281
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.200
Then I went in order of person and then I smoothed it out and um,

282
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.900
and it all worked.
Thank fucking Christ.

283
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.380
The only way to make fun of David Ortiz was to just to make fun of how he looked

284
00:17:12.381 --> 00:17:14.750
in the fact that he was a DH.
That's all I had.

285
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:18.740
And I made fun of the Dominican Republic a little bit.
Um,

286
00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.280
and that was it.
That was it.
So I don't know if this video,

287
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.600
I know Gronk fucking killed per joy.
You're killed.

288
00:17:28.601 --> 00:17:32.440
He told this fucking hilarious story about poppy not knowing his first name was

289
00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:35.080
Dustin.
Somebody said to him like,

290
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.160
poppy was in the batter's box,
not the batter's box.

291
00:17:39.161 --> 00:17:41.800
He was on like the on deck circle and pudge.

292
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:44.620
Roya was stepped out of the batter's box.

293
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:48.310
The umpire called time out of something,
and the catcher just said hello to Dee,

294
00:17:48.311 --> 00:17:49.144
said,
hey,
what's up?

295
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.420
And when Dustin walked over to poppy to talk to him,
poppy said,
he goes,

296
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:57.360
what the fuck did that guy just say to you to fuck did that guy just call you?

297
00:17:57.361 --> 00:18:01.620
He's,
he said,
he said,
what's up Dustin?
Hey,
Papi was like,

298
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:05.490
what the fuck does that mean?
He goes,
ah,
that's my first.

299
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.530
It's my first name Bob.
He was like,
Oh yeah,
like he didn't even know

300
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.910
his name was peewee.
So joy is like,

301
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:21.930
dude,
it's my first name.
They introduced me every time I go up to bat,

302
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:25.710
I've been going up to bat like 10,000 times.
I bad in front of you.

303
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.870
Every time I come to the plate they say,

304
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:31.440
now batting number 15 Dustin Pedroia.

305
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.960
And it just,
it never clicked with them.

306
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.780
There's another guy I would have gone to summer school with Petrolia guidance.

307
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.590
Like I think podria got it the worst.
He was hilarious.

308
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:45.090
He just kept sitting there like,
dude,
what the fuck ever.
You know,
it was just,

309
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:46.050
I think he got,
you know,

310
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:50.370
speaking of 11,000 it was like 11,000 short jokes for him.
So there,

311
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:52.080
there is clips of it up on the Internet.

312
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.470
It wasn't the greatest organized thing was the first time they did it and they

313
00:18:57.631 --> 00:18:58.680
didn't know how to do a roast.

314
00:18:58.681 --> 00:19:02.360
And you can't have people filming at it because Oh,

315
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.480
roast is so over the top.
And that's how people get in trouble and they,
you know,

316
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.420
they take shit out of context and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

317
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.590
It's completely fucking over the top.
So,
uh,

318
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.280
you know,
I don't know why,
I don't know why they let they let people film.

319
00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:21.100
I don't know why things happened.
Why did things happen like that?
But anyways,

320
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.570
I had to go on dead last in everybody fucking killed.

321
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.610
Lenny went up first killed Adam Ray went up dressed as a Yankee fan named Tony,

322
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.780
and he just told everybody in the crowd to suck his dick and kept trashing.
Yeah.

323
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.460
<v 5>Okay.</v>

324
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.180
<v 1>Big Papi and then bragging about the Yankees 27 championships.</v>

325
00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:43.240
And the crowd loved it while they were born and they also so loving it.

326
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.690
He was fucking hilarious.
Um,

327
00:19:46.691 --> 00:19:51.100
Anthony Mackie killed Sarah Tiana fucking destroyed probably at my favorite joke

328
00:19:51.101 --> 00:19:54.670
in the night.
And then,
uh,
fuck,

329
00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:56.980
eh Gronk went up,

330
00:19:56.981 --> 00:20:01.880
killed then [inaudible] and then I had to go up last.
And,

331
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.530
uh,
it's one of those things as you sit there,
you know,

332
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.690
you're kind of losing angles as you go.
So I tried to do,

333
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.720
I tried to just go like a unique way.

334
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.500
So with Gronk I knew everybody was going to say he was stupid.
So I was like,

335
00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:20.560
all right,
I'm going to say smart,
I'm going to go that way with it.

336
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.840
By the way,
by the way.
Um,

337
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.800
he actually was commenting on how he hates going to concerts and everybody sits

338
00:20:29.801 --> 00:20:33.250
there fucking looking at the concept to their phone,
you know what I mean?

339
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.360
How's fucking stupid?
That is,
I love everybody thinks that that guy's dumb.

340
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.370
You know,
like you can make it to the NFL,
memorize the playbook and all of that,

341
00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:43.900
all that fucking shit.

342
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.620
You got to learn and then go out on the field against the top athletes on the

343
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:52.270
planet and make split second decisions and reactions to how they're reacting to

344
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:56.980
you and people feel that you can actually get there and just be this big dumb

345
00:20:56.981 --> 00:21:00.340
guy.
I knew he wasn't going to be done when I met him and he wasn't.

346
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:02.230
So that was a,
uh,

347
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.530
that made the shit that I was going to say about him even better.
I mean,

348
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:08.950
I did one dumb joke about him being dumb,
but I had to get through it.

349
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:12.880
I had to do like fucking 10,
12 minutes.
So anyways,
it uh,
it went great.

350
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:15.120
And my favorite part about it was a,

351
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:16.790
<v 7>okay</v>

352
00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.090
<v 1>poppy yelled,
fuck you with me.
I've at least three or four times</v>

353
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.860
and I just kept going,
fuck you too man.
It's a roast.

354
00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:28.610
Do you want it to get roasted?
Here we go.
And uh,

355
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.340
he was such a fucking great guy.

356
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.410
The Guy Really is a rock star man.
His whole vibe is a fucking rock stuff.

357
00:21:36.411 --> 00:21:37.340
So when I finished,

358
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:42.730
he got up off the chair and came over and gave me a big fucking hug and uh,

359
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.770
and thanked me for doing it.
Just,

360
00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:48.380
it just really like one of the great fucking people I've ever gotten to do

361
00:21:48.381 --> 00:21:52.760
something like that for.
So,
uh,
what was funny is I had,
I had just as much,

362
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.330
I think I had more jokes about Lenny Clark than I did about poppy just cause I

363
00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:59.540
knew him,
which is why I always feel like if you're going to do a roast,

364
00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:02.360
you should know the person.
And,
um,

365
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.340
<v 7>okay.</v>

366
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.710
<v 1>What's hilarious is,
uh,</v>

367
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.810
Lenny has been clean and sober for like a quarter of a century and a,

368
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.520
all of my jokes were about him just being a fucking,
you know,

369
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.670
complete mania.

370
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.970
I talked to him basically like he wasn't sober like he had been sober for,

371
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.730
and he was,
you know,
the best guy about a great sport about itself.

372
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.850
Anyways,
long story short,
um,

373
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.730
I got through it and I told you once I got through that Gig,
my,

374
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.600
the whole rest of my year fucking nothing

375
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.410
<v 8>easy,
easy,
easy,
easy peasy.</v>

376
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.620
<v 1>Everything's in my wheelhouse.
It's the weirdest fucking year from me.
I,</v>

377
00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:43.900
all the crazy shit I had to do this month.

378
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:45.940
<v 7>MMM.</v>

379
00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.300
<v 1>Oh,
this year was all in this month.
All of this stuff of just,</v>

380
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.910
um,
I haven't thought,

381
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.040
<v 7>okay,</v>

382
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.690
<v 1>I haven't sat worried thinking,</v>

383
00:22:55.691 --> 00:23:00.400
how the fuck is this going to go this many times in one month since back when I

384
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:01.870
first started out doing standup,

385
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:06.310
which basically every show I was going up thinking like,
ah,
fuck,

386
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.270
commit to your shit.
Get that first laugh,
ride the wave,

387
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:15.760
don't go over,
say good night.
Get the fuck out of there,
you know,

388
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.030
so,
um,
that's it.
And I'm ready to go to the summer.

389
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.500
The next night we all went to the game,

390
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:25.330
got to see the retirement ceremony and uh,
it was great.
Man.

391
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.920
Jim Rice was there,
Carl Yastrzemski,
uh,
Veritech,

392
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:32.500
Pedro Martinez,

393
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.550
<v 7>MMM Pedroia</v>

394
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.180
<v 1>came out.
And uh,
I got to see the whole thing,
man,
they took the,</v>

395
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.590
you don't want covered it.
Got to see when they were first put 34 up there.

396
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.630
<v 7>And um,</v>

397
00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.750
<v 1>I got to admit though,
part of it was sad.
It was like,
fuck,
it's over.
It's over.</v>

398
00:23:52.751 --> 00:23:56.360
Now he's part of the history of the Boston red sox.

399
00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.930
<v 7>And,
Uhm,
I dunno</v>

400
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.700
<v 1>though.
I think you know all those ceremonies,
man.</v>

401
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:05.500
They was just remind you that you're going to fucking die.
Oh,

402
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.290
now he's too old to play baseball.
He's too old to fucking play.

403
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.910
And I'm like 15 years fucking older than he is a 10 years older than him,

404
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:19.100
you know.
See and call you a strip ski coming out with all white hair.

405
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.733
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

406
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.790
<v 1>I should have known that was coming.</v>

407
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:24.950
That guy played until he was like fucking 40.

408
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.360
<v 7>Okay.</v>

409
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.210
<v 1>Oh my God,
I'm on nine years older than when that guy retired.</v>

410
00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:31.790
Maybe you played like to like 43.
I don't fucking know.

411
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:33.770
This is getting depressing.
How do I get out of this?

412
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.950
How the fuck do I get out of this?
Oh,
I know.

413
00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:41.710
Let's talk F1 and fucking Moto GP.
Pete,
Pete,
Pete.
Um,

414
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.050
<v 7>okay.</v>

415
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.440
<v 1>All right,
so race number,</v>

416
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:50.441
fucking eight or nine of the f one a season in Azerbaijan is that he said

417
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.690
Azerbaijan by Jan,
whatever.

418
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.200
Just east of Georgia and I don't mean fucking Georgia United States,

419
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:06.770
the country,
Georgia and I guess it's in Asia,
eastern Europe.
I was getting,

420
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:08.930
it's always weird,
Georgia and all the way over there.

421
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:11.960
You don't know where the fuck they're at.
One of the coolest cities.

422
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.753
<v 7>MMM.</v>

423
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.170
<v 1>On the f one circuit using that word circuit.
Uh,
just a beautiful city.</v>

424
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:20.240
I would love to go there,
but I definitely looked up like,

425
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:25.040
is that like a one of those places I shouldn't go?
Should I have like a Canadian,

426
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:27.380
a fucking flag on my backpack?

427
00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:32.381
Should I speak in an Irish brogue helped when I go there?

428
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.220
Um,
seem like it was pretty safe.
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

429
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:40.550
I had a great time.
What?
Crazy God damn fucking race.

430
00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:42.890
Congratulations to Daniel Ricardo,

431
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:47.900
who I think might be the best driver in f one considering he doesn't have the

432
00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:50.240
best engine and he's always on the fucking podium.

433
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:55.790
Any drink champagne out of his fucking shoot.
So,
you know,
God bless you.

434
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.490
And I don't know about this Lewis Hamilton guy.
I was a fan.

435
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:00.890
I think he's a fucking great driver,
but I dunno.

436
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:01.750
<v 7>Okay.</v>

437
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.100
<v 1>They said he didn't hit the brakes.
Phil,
you guys don't watch too.</v>

438
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.530
They were under caution and the fucking safety car was out there.
You know,

439
00:26:08.531 --> 00:26:12.310
guys always complain that the safety car drives too fucking slow,
you know,

440
00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:13.640
which cools off their tires.

441
00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:16.920
Then they don't have any grip and then they slam into the fucking wall are into

442
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.870
each other.
Right.
So anyways,

443
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.890
Hamilton was complaining that the fucking guy was driving too slow and then for

444
00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:28.540
whatever reason he hits the brakes really hard and Sebastian Vettel rear ended

445
00:26:28.541 --> 00:26:30.100
him and he was like,
what the fuck?

446
00:26:30.101 --> 00:26:34.390
And then he federal pulls up alongside of them,
slammed his cars and like,

447
00:26:34.391 --> 00:26:38.670
you know,
tire to tire and a,
he got a ten second penalty for that.

448
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.770
<v 7>And UHM,
I dunno,</v>

449
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.060
<v 1>I of view it it</v>

450
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.080
<v 7>and they said to Hamilton,
didn't slam on the brakes,</v>

451
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:49.770
but I kind of viewed this as one of the,
the ball don't lie.
You know,

452
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:52.980
they say that basketball when there's some piece of shit file bullshit,

453
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:56.260
file guide flops,
you go up there and you miss the foul shots.
They,

454
00:26:56.261 --> 00:26:57.360
we see the ball.
Don't lie.

455
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.650
Well only a after that thing they said Hamilton and slam on the brakes.

456
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.310
Hamilton and slam on the brakes and Vettel was guilty of slamming into them and

457
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:06.690
they only gave him a ten second penalty,

458
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:09.960
I guess they said they should have been more,
uh,
so be basically,

459
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:13.470
he has to drive into the fucking pits and sit there for 10 seconds as everybody

460
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:17.790
keeps going and then drives back out again.
But Hamilton after that,

461
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.990
uh,
that fucking thing that goes around his neck or whatever outside the car,

462
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:25.350
that thing came loose.
So he had the fucking Poland anyways,

463
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.600
which fucked him over and Vettel still beat him.

464
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:31.200
So I looked at that like the ball don't lie and Hamilton,
fuck,

465
00:27:31.201 --> 00:27:34.530
I didn't like how he fucking said Deeks says to his team,
say,

466
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.360
bolters said slow down.

467
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:41.390
He should slow down to help me path federal go fuck yourself.

468
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:46.790
What about last year when the team called you up to slow down for fucking a Nico

469
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.630
Rosberg and you're like,
Nah,
I'm good.
You were out there driving for yourself.

470
00:27:51.631 --> 00:27:54.870
You know what that guy reminds me of?
He reminds me of a couple of comedians.

471
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:57.210
I'm not going to fucking mentioned their names when I was on there.

472
00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:00.330
One my way up with them and they were these fucking people.

473
00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:03.630
They were happy if you got something as long as they had more and they would

474
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:06.600
literally stab your mother in the eye if they could get an inch forward.

475
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:09.430
That's what I got out of that fucking shit.
Okay.

476
00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.110
<v 1>He should slow down.</v>

477
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.280
Go fuck you got a fucking Mercedes Benz engine that isn't enough for you.

478
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:19.570
I still like Lewis Hamilton,
but that was kind of girly.
That was kind of girly.

479
00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:23.020
I thought,
you know what I made,
I might be out of my fucking mind.
Yeah.

480
00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:23.830
I don't like that shit.

481
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:28.760
This is why I don't like about f one is basically the fucking Mercedes and,

482
00:28:28.761 --> 00:28:30.040
and the Ferrari's.

483
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.130
<v 7>Okay.</v>

484
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.280
<v 1>Okay.
If you don't root for either one of those other teams,
every other team,</v>

485
00:28:34.281 --> 00:28:38.330
it's like they're out there driving around in a [inaudible] z 28.
Okay.

486
00:28:38.331 --> 00:28:42.260
And Ferrari and Mercedes,
they're driving around in a corvette,
c o six.

487
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.760
Seeing that lance stroll,
he was like 10 seconds ahead of,
uh,

488
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.230
<v 7>a boat us.</v>

489
00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.460
<v 1>What happened to him at the early part of the race?
Well,</v>

490
00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:54.121
there were times when the race,

491
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:55.740
everybody fucking hate each other in the beginning.

492
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:59.250
So he had to go and he was immediately a lap down.
He's a lab down.

493
00:28:59.251 --> 00:29:01.920
He does his stroke arrays.
Shit like a fucking movie.

494
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.370
Just flies through the entire fucking field.

495
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:06.800
<v 7>Okay.</v>

496
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.590
<v 1>I mean Daniel Ricardo did the same thing,
but he sees in the red bull thing,</v>

497
00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:12.470
they got like an inferior engine.
Like they won't give him one of those Mercedes,

498
00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:15.980
they won't sell a guy a Mercedes or a Ferrari engine cause he knows he,

499
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.720
he'd be too much of a problem.

500
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.760
That's why I think he's the best driver out there cause he's driving around a,

501
00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:25.700
basically a fucking c 28 and he's always up on the podium.
So anyways.

502
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.273
<v 7>MMM.</v>

503
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.570
<v 1>For Cindy and my fucking team there,
I don't know what's going on with them.</v>

504
00:29:31.571 --> 00:29:34.840
They got this whole Ricky,
Bobby,
Ricky,
Bobby shit going on,

505
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.230
slamming into each other.
What the fuck is wrong with them?

506
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.320
<v 7>Okay.</v>

507
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.790
<v 1>Esteban.
Oh Khan in Sergio Perez.</v>

508
00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.890
<v 0>They basically took each other out of the race.</v>

509
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:46.720
They would have been on the podium.
One,

510
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:50.170
possibly two cars and for half a fucking second.

511
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
What is it t have the Haas team?
The fucking American team.

512
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.440
Magnuson was like in third place.
All right.

513
00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.500
Two of the Williams.
It was the craziest fucking race.

514
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.120
Like the front of the race was Daniel Ricardo like both Williams,
Martini,

515
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:11.620
Martini racing,
whatever the fuck you say it.
And uh,
Magnuson.

516
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.670
Then of course they all just get run down.
They all get fucking run down.

517
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.710
Both tests was like 10 seconds behind stroll with like 10 laps to go and he

518
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:25.150
fucking caught him right at the finish line to get second place.

519
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.510
Um,
so that's it.

520
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:33.370
I can no longer route for fucking Ferrari and I can't root for a Mercedes

521
00:30:33.371 --> 00:30:35.920
because I feel like I'm rooting for the Yankees or the red sox.

522
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.200
Same reason why I root for the red sox.
It's cause I'm from Boston.

523
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:42.010
What am I supposed to do?
But like,
you know,
they both blow to what?
$1 million,

524
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.360
but not this year.
The Yankees have it.

525
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:46.690
But I'm just saying generally speaking throughout history,
right.
So I can't,

526
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.310
I can't like pylon

527
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.760
pull a Kevin Durant or Lebron down to Miami or the big three in Boston,

528
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.740
two out of three anyways.
Um,
I can't fucking do that.
So my team,
my teams,

529
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:03.910
I like,
I like the force Cindy India team and I liked the uh,

530
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:06.460
the Williams racing team.
That's the coolest looking car,
I think.

531
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:09.400
I liked that college,
you know,
red,
white and blue.

532
00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.870
I guess they used to dominate though.
I got to read up more on the sport.

533
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:17.020
I don't get how you used to fucking dominate.
Then every bend you just suck.

534
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.083
You know?

535
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.930
<v 1>I don't get it.</v>

536
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.800
It's not like other sports where you got athletes getting old and dying,

537
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.370
not dying,
retiring,
I should say.
I mean,

538
00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:32.970
if you know how to make a fucking engine work at that level,

539
00:31:32.971 --> 00:31:34.320
shouldn't you just know how to do it?

540
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.663
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

541
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.340
<v 1>I know.
I know the driver does count for something,
but gee,</v>

542
00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:41.830
I don't fucking know what I'm saying.
I don't know shit about this stuff.

543
00:31:41.831 --> 00:31:45.580
I just know it's fun to watch.
I guess red bull won like three in a row.
Like,

544
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:47.470
I don't five,
six years ago,
and then all of a sudden,

545
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.880
what engine where they using then bold,
look it up,
Bill.
I'm afraid to,

546
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.030
I'm afraid to look it up and I'll be like fucking p's and q's and no one will

547
00:31:55.031 --> 00:31:59.680
have an answer.
So I watched that today.
And then I also watched the,
uh,

548
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:03.070
the Moto GP race,
which was fucking insane.

549
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.590
Both races were great.
The Moto GP race was even fucking better.
Like,

550
00:32:08.591 --> 00:32:11.910
is crazy is that race was sit,
they have a problem with that,
uh,

551
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.750
as or by Jan race where,

552
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:17.050
because it goes through a city that you don't have those cranes to lift the cars

553
00:32:17.051 --> 00:32:20.980
out of the way in this fucking debris all over the track.
Um,

554
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.150
they actually had a red flag and everybody just pulled in and just stopped.

555
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:28.960
There's all these guys were running around the track picking up shit from other

556
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:32.500
cars that is smashed into each other.
As crazy as that race was,

557
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:36.220
the Moto GP race was,
was the shit.
Valentino Rossi,

558
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.910
he's like 38 fucking years old.
He ended up winning the thing.
Um,

559
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.970
just imagine all the bullshit that was happened.

560
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.480
F One with them bumping into each other.
They're doing it on motorcycles,

561
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.980
going like 150,
200 fucking miles an hour.
Um,

562
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.210
you know,
the,
the guy I liked the best on the,

563
00:32:56.211 --> 00:33:00.260
I mean I always root for Valentino Rossi just cause he's old and I relate and I

564
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:02.690
want them to keep winning.
So it doesn't make me feel like,
you know,

565
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:06.230
when he retires.
But God,
there's another guy.
Um,
I liked that.

566
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:10.460
Johann Johann Zarko,
that guy's a fucking lunatic.

567
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.520
And I also liked the color,
the bike,
the black and the yellow,
whatever they got.

568
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.640
Um,
I liked him,
I liked,
and then I also like,
uh,

569
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.360
the Ducati team,
I liked that.

570
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.100
I say his last name Dove,

571
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:27.310
the dove is coc z CEO.
So I can't say it,

572
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.660
I can't say someone's got to say,

573
00:33:29.661 --> 00:33:33.650
I've got to watch another 15 races to be able to pronounce that.
D.
O v I.
Z.
I o.

574
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.770
So
xeo.

575
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:41.771
So Doe Dovi Dovizioso Dovizioso Sad.

576
00:33:41.831 --> 00:33:45.640
I said
German,
Irish,
like we usually have two syllables,

577
00:33:45.641 --> 00:33:49.490
one syllable fucking last name.
I can't,
that's,
that's too many fucking hills.

578
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:55.830
Dovizioso Andrea Dovizioso Gratzi prego.

579
00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.840
Uh,
just an incredible fucking race.
Mac Mac has was in there too.

580
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.800
Um,
and then that fucking lunatic,
the,
the British guy,

581
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.160
cal crutch low.
I don't know where the fuck he came from.

582
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.850
That guy rides like Aluna the way he wrote Yo Zarko I like them.

583
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:18.250
They're out of their fucking mind.
Um,
so I'm uh,
I'm,

584
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.140
I'm all in on both of those races.
They're so fucking easy to watch.

585
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.660
20 something lapse.
And then the,
uh,

586
00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:27.230
the one today with the cars was like watch like 50 fucking lapse 51.

587
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.510
It's a good God damn time.
And then after that I take my daughter out.
You know,

588
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:37.100
lot of people when they want to get their babies to fall asleep,
a lot of dads,

589
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.740
what they do is they put them in the car and they drive around and it's

590
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:41.900
hilarious because the movement makes them go to sleep,

591
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.960
but then you get to a red light and they wake up and they start crying again.

592
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.430
That's why I am a big proponent of the stroller.
All right.

593
00:34:49.431 --> 00:34:51.980
Cause you can keep that fucking thing.
If he has a red light,
you can keep it,

594
00:34:51.981 --> 00:34:52.880
you know,
if you walk in.

595
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.230
And also it's a great way to prevent the dreaded dad bod.

596
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.560
Okay.
All you fucking guys out there,

597
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.700
you throw him in the car and then you drive around,
you know,

598
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.560
then they fall asleep.
And then what do you do?

599
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.720
You hit the drive through because you're tired.
You know,

600
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.411
Arby's,

601
00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:15.650
we have the meats and then you get that fucking sandwich that Osa has a pig on

602
00:35:15.651 --> 00:35:19.310
it.
The pork,
the spare ribs or whatever the fuck they put on there.
The ribs,

603
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.690
the Hoff,
the Hoff.
Um,

604
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.900
yeah,
I've been just walking around my neighborhood and she falls asleep.

605
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:30.980
And then,
uh,

606
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:34.640
I just keep walking throughout her whole nap and went through the fucking

607
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:39.180
poacher,
went to the supermarket,
knock out some errands and she's asleep.

608
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:40.980
He just keep it fucking moving the whole time.

609
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:46.080
You throw the groceries on the bottom of the
stroller and that's it.

610
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.080
There's a little dad tip for you.
If you got it,
you got a better one.

611
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:49.914
I don't know what to tell you.

612
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.260
I do the elliptical while she's still sleeping in the morning.

613
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.940
And then I take a for a trip around the neighborhood.
You got to do it.
He can't,

614
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:00.120
you can't do the car thing.
Then he got to go out and walk.

615
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:04.020
Put on your track suits,
right.
Track shoes,
your dad's socks,

616
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:07.500
you fucking Jean shorts.
Whatever the fuck you got going on.

617
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.140
You're a true religion.
Jeans.

618
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.230
I love that.
I never gave into that fed.

619
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.620
Those were the z Cavariccis a fucking last decade.

620
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.350
Giant stitching with the fucking,

621
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.380
you want to get lucky boy fucking or shoe on the back.

622
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.400
Uh,
there was always something funny about a horse shoe on the ass pockets that

623
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:37.401
always to me was more gay pride parade than a fucking alien fogging chicks over

624
00:36:38.491 --> 00:36:39.960
there.
But they fuck,
they loved them.

625
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:45.870
They loved them and speak in a fucking the gay pride parade.

626
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.260
He know it's slowly making a comeback.

627
00:36:48.261 --> 00:36:51.590
And I love it cause I never had a problem with it is rollerblading.

628
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:56.680
Rollerblading is slowly making a comeback.

629
00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.950
I loved it.
And I used to go down the beach with my short shorts on.

630
00:37:00.951 --> 00:37:05.540
Skating backwards.
Kidding?
Little boy.

631
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:09.470
Short true legend boy shorts.
I did it.
We share.
We all did.
Ah,

632
00:37:09.471 --> 00:37:11.900
there's the Photoshop for the week,
but you know what?

633
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.200
There is no fucking true religion boy shorts that good luck with you on that
one.

634
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:19.160
Fuck.
Oh mmm no,
I liked it.

635
00:37:19.161 --> 00:37:23.660
I used to play fucking in New York and out in Santa Monica down in Venice beach.

636
00:37:23.661 --> 00:37:27.620
I used to play roller hockey,
hockey and uh,

637
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.660
Jesus Christ catching an edge never hurt more than when you were on in a fucking

638
00:37:32.661 --> 00:37:36.470
parking lot.
You had to go elbow pads,

639
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.330
you had to do it elbow and knee pads.
You just had to fucking do it.
You know,

640
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.910
out there address like robocop because when you went down,
you work,

641
00:37:43.911 --> 00:37:47.540
you were fucked.
I'm,
the only thing that sucked is the hockey gloves.

642
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:50.960
He didn't have that thing and I actually broke my wrist or broke a bone in my

643
00:37:50.961 --> 00:37:55.550
wrist.
I used to his eye his,
oh my God.
Way Back.
Way,
way,
way back.

644
00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.020
Way Back in the fucking day.

645
00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.430
I used to play two one to rollerblade hockey at the,

646
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.510
on the top of parking garages in West Hollywood.

647
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.920
Um,
I used to play in with three other comics.

648
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:18.670
It was me and Dane Cook and it was versus the we all Boston comics versus

649
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.060
[inaudible] and rest his soul.
Uh,
Pete coming.

650
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.850
And,
uh,
I remember we used to,

651
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:30.970
I remember playing the day of the Superbowl just laughing at how insane the

652
00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:36.010
fucking weather was that it was 80 degrees out.
We went out there,

653
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.960
had a great fucking game,
super,
super highly competitive fucking game.

654
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.860
And we used to play at the top of the parking garage because for whatever reason

655
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:48.190
on like the Sundays or whatever,
they would just never,

656
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.210
there wouldn't be enough people,

657
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:52.240
no one at a park on the roof because the car would get all fucking hot on the

658
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:55.510
inside.
And we would play up there and sometimes someone will park up there,

659
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:58.750
but no one would ever rat us out in only a couple of times.

660
00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.820
Did the ball ever go over the edge?
That I remember,

661
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:03.010
but we always had like an extra one.
But,
uh,

662
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.490
we do that all the time and it was a great time and,
uh,

663
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:10.270
I never understood why the whole fucking fad went away.

664
00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:14.020
There was one homophobic joke,
one homophobic joke killed the,

665
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:18.370
and what's the hardest thing about rollerblading?
Telling your parents,
telling,

666
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.550
telling your parents that you're gay.
That one little joke,

667
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:25.090
the whole fucking thing.
The whole thing went away.
I never understood it.

668
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.920
I got to the point,
I was the one that the guy who took his break off,

669
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.110
that was like a big thing.
When you lived in New York,

670
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.730
you had to be cool yet to take your break off and learn how to stop the other

671
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:37.564
way.
Like,
yeah,

672
00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:42.310
why would I want to be able to stop quick when I'm skating out in traffic with

673
00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:45.980
cabs and shit?
I can't believe I never died.
Um,

674
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.430
I had a couple of really close calls,
so fucking stupid.

675
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:52.150
I would never do that again.
I just chalked that up to uh,
being young.

676
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:57.130
Like I still lived in New York and I was close to Central Park Park Park Park,

677
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.420
and I was going to go roller blading.
I would,
I would at this my age,

678
00:40:01.421 --> 00:40:04.810
I would walk to the park carrying my fucking roller blades.

679
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.900
I have no shame about it.

680
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.700
I know a lot of people are embarrassed that they rollerbladed.

681
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.190
I have no fucking shame.
No shame.

682
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:19.510
If I lived closer to a boardwalk,
I would own a pair and I would go out there.

683
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:22.720
It's so much more fun than doing the fucking elliptical.

684
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.460
It's better exercise.
You know,
you put on your wireless headphones,
right?

685
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.620
You tie is tee tee shirt off at the waist and you know,
you go out there and you,

686
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.770
you have a good time.
Maybe you have some tassels on.

687
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.350
I don't know why I am.

688
00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.190
I think it's hilarious that everybody got all fucking weird about it.
Um,

689
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:47.771
as you could tell,

690
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:51.190
I haven't read any advertising and I haven't done any fucking questions because

691
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:55.570
a,
I'm recording it early and I still haven't gotten my materials for the week.

692
00:40:55.571 --> 00:41:00.430
Let's hit refresh.
See if they came in.
Let's see.
Nothing,

693
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.040
nothing,
nothing.
No advertising,
no nothing.
All right,
I'll keep talking here.

694
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.250
I'll keep talking.
I'll read the ads and then I'll do the fucking,

695
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:15.460
I'll do the fucking,
uh,
what do you call it?
Uh,
do the questions.

696
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.540
All right.
Um,
all right.
No Dad Bod,

697
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:24.400
Ernie talked about that.
Oh,
Billy.
No Fun.
Billy.
No Fun.
Billy.
No Fun.

698
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:27.790
Didn't drink until Friday night.
Um,

699
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.850
took my nephew to the game and after I dropped him off,

700
00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:35.851
I went back into the city and I had a two home pores and a fucking,

701
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.620
uh,
an s in a cigar,
but then I didn't drink last night.

702
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:43.490
And today I had one course late just because they made the old stubby bottles

703
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:46.310
again and I just had to add one and it was fucking delicious.

704
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.360
But I don't count that.
I just had one.
I didn't get fucked up.
Um,
anyways,

705
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:56.480
so I've been doing that shit.
Got To drinking back under control.

706
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:59.660
And um,
I'm going to find out this week,
by the way,

707
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:02.660
if there's going to be a season,
three of f is for family,

708
00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:07.580
so I'm a little nervous,
um,
to find out.
So,

709
00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:09.020
uh,
if you haven't watched it yet,

710
00:42:09.021 --> 00:42:13.940
it would really help us if you guys would watch this week to give a nice little

711
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:17.480
boost.
You know,
I know there's a ton of good shit out there.
Ain't no blood line.

712
00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:20.660
Came back and it was something you guys are working your way through Fargo or

713
00:42:20.661 --> 00:42:24.240
better call Saul.
But uh,
if he could just give us just,
you know,

714
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.680
watch one episode,
something,
anything will help.
Um,

715
00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.970
cause we're going to find out this week.
And um,
so anyways,

716
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.840
I went to the red sox Friday night.

717
00:42:33.841 --> 00:42:37.310
Saturday I came home and the angel's game was on against the red sox cause you

718
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:41.330
know,
I get the angels feed out here and now back into watching baseball.

719
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:47.020
I'm watching racing and I actually watched the end of the BCA eagles versus the

720
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.310
Edmonton Eskimos.
I watched a CFL game,

721
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.530
I gotta tell you it was highly entertaining because the BC eagles fucking

722
00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:55.670
defense sucks.

723
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:57.623
<v 7>MMM.</v>

724
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.180
<v 1>One of those high scoring games or whatever.</v>

725
00:43:01.181 --> 00:43:04.690
They tied it up and then you know what?
Like tighten it up.

726
00:43:04.691 --> 00:43:06.100
It's like no time left.

727
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.510
The Edmonton Eskimos go out in the first fucking play.
They gave up,
I don't know,

728
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.590
a nice 80 yard meter,
whatever the fuck they call it,

729
00:43:15.591 --> 00:43:19.280
a kilometer of whatever they call it up there a pass.

730
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.430
And then they lost the game,
kicked a field goal and it was over.

731
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:26.840
And I know a lot of people,
shit on the CFL.
It's on Tsn.
It's good shit.

732
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.940
You know,
I look at it this way,

733
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
this is college players that weren't good enough to make it,

734
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.940
you know,
into the end,
into the NFL.
But any,

735
00:43:38.941 --> 00:43:42.170
any one of those CFL teams could beat the best fucking college team out there

736
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:46.050
cause it's made of college.
All stars like the NFL,
it's college,
all stars.

737
00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.530
The NFL is just the best of the best college.
All stars.

738
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.520
The CFL is all the call jol stars that could not make it to the NFL.

739
00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:55.700
So it's still competitive football.
They got that giant field.

740
00:43:55.701 --> 00:43:59.920
I actually enjoyed it.
Um,
I dunno,

741
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.880
I always watched like the Edmonton Eskimos just because like way back in the day

742
00:44:02.881 --> 00:44:05.810
though,
we seem like Doug Flutie and Warren Moon or some shit.

743
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:10.450
We're always on those teams,
but you know,

744
00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.210
I dunno,
BC Eagles came back,
so I was like,
I gotta I gotta Watch these,

745
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.710
I'm going to root for these guys and they fuck the game up.
Um,
all right.

746
00:44:17.711 --> 00:44:19.870
I don't know what else to talk about.
I'm running out of shit.

747
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:24.970
A congratulations to the lady and in Australia who breastfed in Durham,

748
00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:30.060
in parliament.
I don't know why that was a big deal,

749
00:44:30.061 --> 00:44:34.170
but evidently it's a deal.
I don't know.
I have to be honest with you.

750
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.220
My whole fucking life,

751
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:38.520
I've never heard one guy ever say that he had an issue with breastfeeding in

752
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:40.530
public.
I don't know what the fucking problem is.

753
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.633
<v 7>MMM.</v>

754
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.880
<v 1>I think it's more for like guys that don't have kids yet and it like grosses him</v>

755
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:48.631
out cause they're like,

756
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:52.110
I want to be sticking my face in there and now there's a baby there and that

757
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:54.840
weirds me out and it makes my chubby go away.

758
00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.690
I don't know what the deal is.
I also don't think I,
but I'd be honest with you,

759
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:03.330
I don't think you should be breastfeeding while you're fucking,
you know,

760
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:06.240
working for your district,
you know,
can,

761
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:08.550
can we have your 100% focus here?

762
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.180
<v 7>Okay.</v>

763
00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.013
<v 1>You know,
I dunno,
I,</v>

764
00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.560
but I guess guys could go up there and adjust their balls and said,

765
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:15.810
talking about laws.
I Dunno.
I Dunno why.

766
00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:18.630
I don't know what the big deal is about it.
Uh,

767
00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.460
I've seen it my whole fucking life,

768
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.510
but I also don't know why it's treated like somebody just landed on Mars and

769
00:45:24.511 --> 00:45:28.830
came back.
You know,
anything women do is now,
it's just like,

770
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:33.090
it was so afraid.
It was so groundbreaking,
you know,
they try to act like,

771
00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.980
you know,
they were,
they weren't brave heart.

772
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.390
So like you fed a baby cause it was hungry.
Um,

773
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.970
ah,
Brian and I just shift to talk about royal blood has a new album out.

774
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:47.790
Everybody.
No,
I didn't download their first one.

775
00:45:47.791 --> 00:45:50.910
I just downloaded that hit and I played my drums to it a thousand times and I

776
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:54.450
still suck at it,
you know,
then something,
something to do.
But,

777
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:59.370
but blue gotta fucking work it out.
Wham,
Bam,

778
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:02.660
Bam.
Blow blow,

70.

779
00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.300
[inaudible] he did the cabbage do the blue.
However the fucking song goes.

780
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:10.880
I don't even know the words.
Um,
Wale.

781
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.370
Why did it,
why did a ball,
uh,

782
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.760
royal blood has a new album out and it got good reviews.

783
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:21.120
So I'm going to download that shit cause I have a fucking,

784
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:24.990
I got a little rehearsal space.
I was over there today,
was over there today.

785
00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:29.670
I got my fucking life down.
It's perfect.
Wake up in the morning.
I work out.
Right.

786
00:46:29.671 --> 00:46:31.770
Why the kids sleeping?
My wife's sleeping.
Then I run over.

787
00:46:31.771 --> 00:46:33.180
I played drums for a fucking hour.

788
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.620
I come back like a champ and make everybody breakfast.
You know,

789
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.010
I get my bull shit done and then in the afternoon I,
uh,

790
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.450
take my fucking precious little baby girl for a walk.

791
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.140
That's it.
That's it.
But you know what?

792
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.700
My wife will still find something to complain to me about something.

793
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:55.890
I'll ask something,
there'll be something I'm doing wrong.

794
00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:01.290
I just feel like I would like it better.
If you,

795
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.410
I feel like for me.
Uh,
all right.

796
00:47:04.411 --> 00:47:07.050
This is the last thing that I've got to hit pause until this fucking shit comes

797
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:11.010
in.
Uh,
the questions here,
come on man.

798
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:14.460
Send the fuck questions.
Refresh button.
Hit the refresh button.
Bill,

799
00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.550
hit the refresh button.
Nothing.

800
00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:24.910
Wait a minute.
I'm an asshole.
Oh,
it was in the wrong account.

801
00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.370
What an asshole.

802
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.640
What an that this the kind of guy doesn't know the difference between

803
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:32.260
photosynthesis and pollination

804
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.370
fighting under the blue corner.
Here we go.
Ah,
well Lo and behold,

805
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:42.880
there it is and we go out.
It's time for some advertising.

806
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.070
I was just going to give you guys a fun bit.
Baseball fact.

807
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:49.420
Remind me when I come back,
he can't,
but I'll,
you know.
All right.

808
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.530
Oh

809
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.620
<v 9>Dotomi Andy's me undies.</v>

810
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:58.621
They used to be two all star games due to to to days [inaudible] between 1959 in

811
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.750
1962

812
00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.770
<v 1>and everybody went up to play their balls hurt.</v>

813
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.680
They didn't know what to do cause it's so tomato wall data and have far,

814
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.080
that one sucked.
I got to take two on that one.
I tried to give you the all state,

815
00:48:13.081 --> 00:48:16.290
there was two all star games in 1959 60,

816
00:48:16.291 --> 00:48:21.120
61 and I believe 62,
um,
I might as well give it to you now,

817
00:48:21.121 --> 00:48:23.580
right?
Might as well tell it to you.
Why not?
You know,
why it is,

818
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.140
do you know why they had to all star games now?
Because you know,

819
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.000
people couldn't afford to travel.
So they had one on the east coast,

820
00:48:30.001 --> 00:48:34.530
one on the west coast.
It wasn't that,
it wasn't heavy.
Okay.

821
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.630
It turns out that uh,

822
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.110
playing of the second game was intended to increase the amount of money going to

823
00:48:40.111 --> 00:48:43.890
the players pension fund.
Uh,
as a person says,

824
00:48:43.891 --> 00:48:45.900
I wish there was a need or reason than that,

825
00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:50.901
like gambling demands or trial formation of an allstar league,

826
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:53.190
which would be made up of two teams of all stars.

827
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:56.970
They played each other a hundred times a season,
but nope.
Pension Fund.
That's it.

828
00:48:56.971 --> 00:49:01.500
And everybody realized by 1962 or so that the arrangement was dumb.

829
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:05.340
Uh,
the public at large is finding a second all star game,

830
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:09.510
something of an anticlimax like playing a second world series in Brazil.

831
00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:13.560
So 1951,
1960,
61,

832
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:19.080
1959,
sorry,
60,
61.
They played to all star Games.
There you go.

833
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:23.850
And I learned that this weekend when I saw a pennant from Fenway about the 1961,

834
00:49:23.851 --> 00:49:27.000
all star games and they called the Cincinnati reds by the way,
the red legs,

835
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:30.240
which I had never heard of either.
Hey Bill,
why don't you get to the advertising?

836
00:49:30.241 --> 00:49:33.120
Because that was some of the most boring shit I've ever listened to in my life.

837
00:49:33.121 --> 00:49:37.320
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Fair enough.
Ah.

838
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.060
<v 9>Doto me,
Andy's me undies.</v>

839
00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:44.010
Mind your fucking cues and ps to do to to me undies.

840
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.330
Me undies.

841
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:51.010
<v 1>I can't fucking sing it this week I got nothing this week my brain is fried for</v>

842
00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:52.690
rhinos.

843
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.700
Roast for y'all because I thought if I was ended with peas and gave me some

844
00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:58.670
around me,
undies mean Andy's mine.

845
00:49:58.671 --> 00:50:02.910
Your fucking p's and q's to do to me undies.

00:59:01.681 --> 00:59:05.850
cancer patients and what happens to these people and they're going to go to jail

990
00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:13.700
children's cancer fund.
All right.
Let's see.

991
00:59:13.701 --> 00:59:15.090
In a rare of a vibrate,

992
00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:20.090
each of the charities charge where the subject of extensive reporting by CNN in

993
00:59:20.091 --> 00:59:21.020
2013 I,

994
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.620
cause I remember this story and in each instance none of the four charities

995
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:25.454
would comment.

996
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:29.510
We were ordered out of the building at the cancer fund of America in Knoxville,

997
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:34.280
Tennessee.
Oh,
on the Tennessee voluntary,
uh,

998
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:35.850
and worthy object of an abyss,

999
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:39.780
of an obscene gesture by the CEO of the breast cancer society.
Am I,

1000
00:59:39.781 --> 00:59:42.200
that's usually,
that's usually a good sign that it's bullshit.

1001
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.760
If you're raising money for cancer to help kids stricken with cancer and you're

1002
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:50.600
the CEO and you give the finger of media which is going to help promote,
yeah,

1003
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:51.590
that's probably a good sign.

1004
00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:56.030
The Cancer Fund of America is run by James rendered senior,
his son,

1005
00:59:56.031 --> 00:59:58.520
James Rental Junior.
This is all alleged,
by the way,

1006
00:59:58.521 --> 01:00:02.840
before these scumbags allegedly start to sue me for reading.

1007
01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:06.230
This is the CEO of the breast cancer society and other charity.

1008
01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:10.790
The child's cancer fund of America is run by Rose Park and the ex wife of the

1009
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:12.660
elder James Reynolds,
he is,

1010
01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.680
he's also the CEO of the Fourth Charity Cancer Support Support Server Services.

1011
01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:22.260
<v 7>Oh Wow.
Wow.
Well,</v>

1012
01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.570
<v 1>if they're doing dirt,
I hope they get caught and they go to fucking jail.</v>

1013
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.110
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1014
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:31.320
<v 1>Jesus Christ,
man,
that is like some sociopath shit.</v>

1015
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:34.490
Jesus Christ.

1016
01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:37.880
<v 7>Oh my God.</v>

1017
01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.880
Are you going out buying like a fucking buy yourself a raptor like a fucking,

1018
01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:49.020
<v 1>what could you,
here's something for you.
What could you by yourself</v>

1019
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.350
with,
with cancer?

1020
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:53.680
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1021
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.830
<v 1>Shit that was supposed to go to,
to help kids.
What could you by yourself?</v>

1022
01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.300
Oh my God.
That at that is that,
I mean that is just,
yeah,
that's just,

1023
01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.450
that's on another fucking level.

1024
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.320
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1025
01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.830
<v 1>I think even bankers would be like,
really do Jesus Christ.</v>

1026
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:14.250
<v 7>How about a little fucking little bit of tact?
Something.
Um,</v>

1027
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:18.930
<v 1>all right.
Transgender habits.
Hey,
Billy muffin top.
Oh,
that's so true.</v>

1028
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.790
I listened to Andrea had a few months ago,
maybe even a few years ago.

1029
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:28.020
Oh Jesus.
Sorry.
Losing credibility.
I can't remember.
It was last month or 2010.

1030
01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:30.210
I heard his segment.
You might be interested in,

1031
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:34.920
I believe it was this American life,
but they asked a transgendered man.

1032
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.450
Uh,

1033
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.550
<v 5>okay.</v>

1034
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.810
<v 1>I don't know what that mean.
A woman becoming a man.
I get it.
I think,
uh,</v>

1035
01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:46.560
if there was any interesting changing,
well he talked about after his transition,

1036
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.930
he was now more into science,

1037
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:54.390
was way more interested in sex and wasn't able to access his emotions as much

1038
01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:58.940
anymore.
Oh.
So those are basically guy things.

1039
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.030
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1040
01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:00.990
<v 1>That's kind of interesting.</v>

1041
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.850
I would think way more interested in sex because you're finally a sex.

1042
01:02:03.851 --> 01:02:04.684
You want to be

1043
01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:05.530
<v 5>okay.</v>

1044
01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:09.190
<v 1>Science.
That's really interesting and weren't able to access your emotions more.</v>

1045
01:02:09.191 --> 01:02:12.670
I Dunno.
I have no idea.
That's,
well,
there you go.

1046
01:02:12.671 --> 01:02:16.750
So maybe I wasn't wrong thinking that somebody's habits changed a female

1047
01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:20.670
privilege.
Hey Man,
I love your podcast.

1048
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.910
Hope your family's doing great.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1049
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:26.460
Wasn't that Nice of you?
My family is doing great.

1050
01:02:26.461 --> 01:02:28.230
My daughter is awesome and my wife,

1051
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:31.590
I have a whole new level of love for watching a BMR awe.

1052
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.820
Have a read at this article when you get a chance.

1053
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:41.430
Um,
okay.
Female nurse found guilty of dangerous driving,

1054
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.840
causing death to be sentenced.
Do I want to read this?

1055
01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:47.850
There weren't any kids involved in this.
This,
this con.

1056
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:50.880
We already saw a potential scam.

1057
01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.301
Okay.

1058
01:02:53.301 --> 01:02:57.350
Be Seen or is found guilty of dangerous driving causing death sentence to 90

1059
01:02:57.351 --> 01:02:58.400
days in jail.

1060
01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:02.180
The families of two young people are angry over a dangerous driving sentence,

1061
01:03:02.181 --> 01:03:07.030
giving the woman who killed them,
okay.
The be seniors found guilty of data.
Okay?

1062
01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.800
Causing death of two people's been sentenced to 90 days in jail

1063
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:18.380
and Alina Hesi Mobic was driving at high speeds through pet pit meadows.

1064
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:21.360
And October,
2010 she ran a red light,

1065
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:26.361
jumped a concrete median and slammed into a car carrying Becky Dyer 19 and

1066
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:34.161
Johnny d all Avera 21 the couple who were on their way home from a concert where

1067
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:38.850
killed instantly along with the 90 day sentence.

1068
01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.390
Hesi Mobic also received two years provoked probation,

1069
01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:45.810
120 hours of community service in three years driving probation.

1070
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:47.190
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1071
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.680
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1072
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:54.980
She will serve her sentence intermittently between Tuesdays and Thursdays around

1073
01:03:54.981 --> 01:03:59.170
her work schedule.
Oh my God.

1074
01:03:59.171 --> 01:04:02.230
What a joke.
Diyers.
Mother.
Debbie said,

1075
01:04:02.231 --> 01:04:05.560
this sentence is not showing the public that our justice system actually is a

1076
01:04:05.561 --> 01:04:08.140
justice system.
It's actually a legal system.

1077
01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:11.020
It's not going to deter other drivers from doing the same.

1078
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:12.460
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1079
01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:17.200
<v 1>Oh my God.
D all of errors.
Mom,
Audrey echoed the same sentiment.</v>

1080
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.270
Six years is a long time.

1081
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:24.290
She's put everybody through and she's only getting a little bit here.

1082
01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:26.600
A little bit there.
It's wrong.
Yeah.
That's terrible.

1083
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.890
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1084
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:29.330
<v 1>That's fucking terrible.</v>

1085
01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.410
That's fucking horrible.

1086
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:35.350
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1087
01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.860
<v 1>You know at some point when you're driving that fast,
you do.
I mean,</v>

1088
01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.970
I think those laws are all going to change.
I know they have with drunk driving.

1089
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:44.500
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1090
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.160
<v 1>I think because she wasn't drunk in jails are all filled up,</v>

1091
01:04:48.161 --> 01:04:50.800
at least in this country.
Like I don't understand that.

1092
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.660
But I mean,
your life should be tremendously effective if you were,

1093
01:04:56.661 --> 01:05:00.470
if you were driving that fucking fast and then killed two innocent people.

1094
01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:02.590
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1095
01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:05.420
<v 1>I think the whole,
well,
she's never committed a crime.
She's a nurse.</v>

1096
01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:07.720
She's a productive member of society.

1097
01:05:07.721 --> 01:05:10.660
I think a lot of that goes out the fucking window.
Well,

1098
01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:13.810
she did something tremendously stupid.
And now two people are dead forever.

1099
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.810
So at the very least you can do 90 straight days in,

1100
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.230
what do you say there and,
and,
yeah,

1101
01:05:20.231 --> 01:05:22.110
I guess you'll have to figure out what you're going to fire.

1102
01:05:22.111 --> 01:05:26.470
You gonna find another job after that.
What kind of cool job does she have?

1103
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:27.880
I have to be on jail.

1104
01:05:27.881 --> 01:05:32.881
I've been in jail on Tuesday and Thursdays because I killed two people on

1105
01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:36.760
Tuesday.
I go to jail for the woman I killed on Thursday.

1106
01:05:36.761 --> 01:05:40.450
I go to jail for the guy I killed.
So I can,

1107
01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:43.550
I work like Monday,
not Wednesdays.

1108
01:05:43.551 --> 01:05:47.680
So there'll be like so tired from being jail from one day.
Um,

1109
01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.480
can I work like Monday,
Friday,
Saturday and a half day Sunday?

1110
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:58.240
Uh,
that's,
yeah.
That's disgusting.
Fucking disgusting.
All right.

1111
01:05:58.241 --> 01:06:02.950
My girlfriend is becoming a feminist.
Hey there,
daddy bald,

1112
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:07.120
freckle.
First of all,
English is isn't my mother tongue.

1113
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:10.000
So sorry if I fucked up a bit.
All right.
I was wondering why that

1114
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:17.300
I can just see you googling daddy bold,
freckle and just mashing them.

1115
01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:18.600
That's what I would've done.
All right.

1116
01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:23.010
And I'm 33 years old and I'm an 80 in an 18 month relationship with a terrific

1117
01:06:23.011 --> 01:06:25.800
girl.
After four rather unsuccessful relationship,

1118
01:06:25.801 --> 01:06:30.360
I finally had the feeling she could be the one.
Um,

1119
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:33.300
she has her flaws like every person,
but hey,
so do I.

1120
01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:37.140
But when it comes down to the important features like honesty,
moral values,

1121
01:06:37.141 --> 01:06:40.170
similar lifestyles and interests,
she really is my match.

1122
01:06:40.171 --> 01:06:43.230
And to top it all off in bed,
it never gets boring.

1123
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:47.670
Do this is your second language.
This is great.
She's more on the submissive side.

1124
01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:51.530
Maybe you just fucking with me.
And he deliberately wrote a bad insult.
Um,

1125
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:56.130
she's more on the [inaudible] side.
If you understand wink in some things,

1126
01:06:56.131 --> 01:07:00.270
sometimes get wild,
gross,
gross.

1127
01:07:00.271 --> 01:07:03.360
I now have no sympathy for you,
but in a very nice way.

1128
01:07:03.361 --> 01:07:07.110
He tries to say after our sexy time session gross,

1129
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:11.340
we lay next to each other.
Comp.
Ah,

1130
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.950
completely out of breath,
feeling like nothing can touch his sounds cheesy,

1131
01:07:16.951 --> 01:07:21.300
but it's really beautiful.
Why did you go into all that detail?
Oh my God,

1132
01:07:21.301 --> 01:07:22.470
that was disgusting.

1133
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:26.490
They would tell you guys how much I can't stand watching people kiss in public

1134
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:29.460
on film Marina.
It's,
it's the grossest fucking thing ever.

1135
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:39.240
Keep your intimacies to yourself.
Uh,
now we have a long distance relationship.

1136
01:07:39.241 --> 01:07:43.230
We are far away,
but we still eat.
You see,
still see each other quite often.

1137
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:49.030
Five times per year,
but then usually weeks at a time too.

1138
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:53.590
What the fuck just happened?
What the hell?
What just happened?

1139
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:59.730
Was there a jump in time here?
Was there some time travel going on here?

1140
01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:04.080
She lives in Europe and has been hanging out with these feminist activists girls

1141
01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.520
and she's bringing up the topic of sexism,
et Cetera.
More and more lately now,

1142
01:08:08.521 --> 01:08:13.140
I was raised by a proud mother.
Oh Geez.
This is there.
Any other kind,
proud,

1143
01:08:13.141 --> 01:08:16.670
strong woman and could not imagine dating a girl that has,

1144
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:22.180
has values of women out of the 1950s I like confident,

1145
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:22.821
proud women.

1146
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:25.700
This is what he always sets himself up to be a good guy that can hold their own.

1147
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:28.610
But even though I am not a chauvinist by any means,

1148
01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:33.890
I think the modern feminist movement,
similar to Vegans,
annoying the living,

1149
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:37.970
annoys the living hell out of me.
I get that there is sexism in this world,

1150
01:08:37.971 --> 01:08:40.070
but I don't see the huge problem in it,

1151
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:44.210
especially since the western societies have made such progress in this field in

1152
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:47.630
the past decades.
Yeah.
I mean,
I don't know.

1153
01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:50.460
You keep talking yourself back into the hole there.
Yeah.

1154
01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.980
Like a total psycho 100% feminist maniac.
Yeah.

1155
01:08:54.981 --> 01:08:55.910
You don't want to be around that.

1156
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:59.960
It's literally like being around a conspiracy theorist after awhile as far as,

1157
01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:02.900
they're never going to shut the fuck up about that topic and it's gonna drive

1158
01:09:02.901 --> 01:09:05.180
you nuts after awhile.
Um,

1159
01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.500
do you realize that every day 40% of women are going to be throwing stats at
you?

1160
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:14.270
Like someone who plays fantasy football.
Anyway,
he says today,

1161
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:18.050
my girlfriends sent me a link to an article about how pornography objectifies

1162
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:21.050
it's discriminates women.
Then she wrote,

1163
01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:24.770
I've been thinking a lot lately and I'll have to change some things in the

1164
01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:27.200
future,
especially in our sex life.
Yeah,
dude,

1165
01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:29.870
this relationship is over a now.

1166
01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:34.370
I tend to agree with now I tend to agree with this auto button.
Nevertheless,

1167
01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.080
I furiously,
your pied,
Hey,

1168
01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:39.650
if you're going to turn it to one of the these nonstop nagging feminist,

1169
01:09:39.651 --> 01:09:44.651
please tell me now so I can even move the fuck further away from you and your

1170
01:09:45.651 --> 01:09:50.510
victim seeking miserable friends.
Yeah,
dude,
you're kind of an asshole.

1171
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:52.220
You're kind of an asshole.

1172
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.473
<v 7>MMM.</v>

1173
01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:57.330
<v 1>Slash a bit of a control freak,
I think.
I Dunno.</v>

1174
01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.870
But then you're cool with her moving away.
I don't know.
I can't read you.
He goes,

1175
01:10:00.871 --> 01:10:02.790
then things escalated quickly.
Yeah.

1176
01:10:02.791 --> 01:10:06.300
You think we got into a big fight and haven't communicated since?
Yeah.
Dude,

1177
01:10:06.301 --> 01:10:10.080
it's so rapid.
It was already a rap.
It was already a wrap.
You know,

1178
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:14.130
if you just imagine if you got into something.
Okay.

1179
01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.700
And then you came home and whatever your new fucking way of thinking was,

1180
01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:22.020
you told your wife or girlfriend that she needed to adjust some things in the

1181
01:10:22.021 --> 01:10:25.170
bedroom.
I mean,
try that one on for size.
Yeah.

1182
01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.550
What it is is she's grown in a different direction and she needs to be,

1183
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.360
uh,
you know,
I don't know.
She's,

1184
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:37.550
we was with a different type of guy,
not you.
Now Bill,
this is a girl.

1185
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:42.200
This girl is great and smart and TB.
H I don't know what that means.

1186
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.430
I am all for women's rights and see sexism on a daily basis and totally

1187
01:10:46.431 --> 01:10:49.370
understand some of the way I would stop fucking making yourself out to be the

1188
01:10:49.371 --> 01:10:54.140
hero.
I'm not one of these guys,
but I'm not one of these guys.

1189
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:58.130
So leave me the fuck alone with this stuff and if this stuff will interfere with

1190
01:10:58.131 --> 01:11:00.740
our sex life and changed the woman that I have learned to love,

1191
01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.870
I don't know where this will leave us.
What do you think of this?

1192
01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:06.140
Am I being too non empathetic here?
It's been,

1193
01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:09.860
I don't think you're an empathetic person.
Um,

1194
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.590
I would say that,
uh,
yeah,
I,
this is a wrap.

1195
01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:17.130
This is not the kind of woman you're looking for.
Um,

1196
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.720
and this is a major change in her.
All right.
I mean,

1197
01:11:21.721 --> 01:11:23.820
I don't know what goes on between the two of you,
but if she's going to be like,

1198
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:28.020
hey,
watch this and we need to change some stuff in the bedroom,
like the,

1199
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:31.980
the relationship as you know,
it is over and uh,

1200
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:36.870
and it's long distance.
I mean,
yeah,
it's,
it's a fucking rap.

1201
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:41.790
I would walk away.
Um,
all right.
Fucked up at,
at pet shop.

1202
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.320
Last one here.
Fucked up at the pet shop.

1203
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:52.610
He's where's dad goes pet shop boys.

1204
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:57.270
That's right.
And I fucked up at pet shop.
How's it going?
Oh,
Billy Bordeaux.

1205
01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:02.090
Bullocks.
Um,
love the podcast.
Congrats to the guy.

1206
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:03.150
Thank you very much.

1207
01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.673
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1208
01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:07.370
<v 1>All the great work on F is for family bag east.</v>

1209
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.980
Haven't laughed at anything so hard and long time old.
Billy.

1210
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:14.270
I fucked up recently,
but no one knows I've done anything wrong.

1211
01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:18.140
I work in a pet shop,
we sell rabbits and mice,
things like that.

1212
01:12:18.141 --> 01:12:20.480
And my job is to feed them and clean their cages.

1213
01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:21.800
I already don't like where this is going.

1214
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.440
Not the most exciting thing in the world,

1215
01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:26.890
but I love animals and they look so sad a lot of the time,

1216
01:12:26.891 --> 01:12:29.840
so I try to make their lives a little better by looking after them the best I

1217
01:12:29.841 --> 01:12:33.860
can.
That's what I would do if I worked at a pet store.
Long Story Short,

1218
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:35.480
I'm fairly new,

1219
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:39.830
so the first day I was taught how to tell the male rabbits from the female

1220
01:12:39.831 --> 01:12:43.670
rabbits.
Turns out you have to feel for the testicles,

1221
01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.110
which wasn't that hard as a lot of the rabbits had really big balls like holy

1222
01:12:48.111 --> 01:12:52.880
shit and I was pretty confident that I could do it in the future.
God,

1223
01:12:52.881 --> 01:12:56.900
these are weird this week.
Fast forward to Monday,
turns out I cannot do it.

1224
01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:02.260
We've got a whole load of new Lionhead rabbits in with massive for making it

1225
01:13:03.861 --> 01:13:06.290
almost impossible to locate the balls.

1226
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.530
We'll just flick them between the legs.

1227
01:13:09.531 --> 01:13:12.410
If the rabbit turns around like what the fuck was that for it?
She has a pussy.

1228
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.810
You fucking flicking between the legs and the thing collapses,
you know,

1229
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:21.380
and lays there for 30 seconds while his other friends laugh at him.
Uh,

1230
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:25.130
that is a male and the ones laughing.
Well,
women laugh at that shit too.

1231
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:30.350
Anyways,
at that stage it was just me and one of the student,

1232
01:13:30.351 --> 01:13:33.230
part time workers who probably had just learned to locate his own balls,

1233
01:13:33.231 --> 01:13:37.910
let alone someone else's.
Uh,
why is this a big deal?
Well,
I can tell you,

1234
01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.520
I,
I think you can figure out,
we can,

1235
01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.030
why we can't put the males in with the females bill.

1236
01:13:44.031 --> 01:13:45.770
I seriously don't know what the fuck happened,

1237
01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:49.960
but I went home that evening having no idea if I was going to arrive back into

1238
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:54.260
work with double the number of rabbits.
I know that's not how gestation works,

1239
01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:57.770
but fuck it.
Uh,
what would you do if you were in my situation?

1240
01:13:57.771 --> 01:14:00.890
I just started working here and I really like it,
but I have no idea how.

1241
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:05.210
Explain how I fucked this up so badly.
Thanks.
Well,
what happened?

1242
01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:11.290
We've got a whole new low of new line,

1243
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:15.030
had rabbits in with massive for making it almost impossible.
So what is this,

1244
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.120
what is the problem here?

1245
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:19.090
You're worried that you're going to put them in with the wrong ones and a taf

1246
01:14:19.091 --> 01:14:23.590
fuck.
Oh my God.
I just dropped my fucking laptop on my foot.

1247
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:29.080
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
Um,
I don't know what the problem is,
sir.

1248
01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.720
What I would do is I would come clean before you have 7,000 rabbits and they got

1249
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:37.390
to feed them to the snakes.
That's what I would do.
All right.

1250
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.590
How hard is it to find fucking balls?

1251
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:48.700
I'd put on a glove and I go,
you're like underneath them.

1252
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:52.780
You know Dennis had done it,
a Buddhist about it up.
I don't know.

1253
01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:55.180
I don't know why you're out of my,
I'm out of my element.

1254
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.000
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know how to find rabbit balls.

1255
01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.450
I would definitely come clean and say that you think you fucking messed up

1256
01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.590
because a,
the fact that you're running from this problem like that guy in Fargo.

1257
01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:09.250
Ah,
gees.
I'm going to get you the numbers like you're doing that right now.

1258
01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:10.840
All right?

1259
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.790
And I'm afraid you're going to end up blaming the fucking college student.

1260
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.280
All right?
So I would just come clean.
Say that you fucked up.

1261
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.860
I don't think they're going to fire you over it.
You know what I mean?
Uh,

1262
01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.310
that's what I would do,
and I would learn how to find rabbit balls.

1263
01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.880
I would get into an Atlanta business.
All right?
Okay,
there you go.

1264
01:15:27.881 --> 01:15:32.140
That's the podcast for this week.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1265
01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:34.000
If you'd like to contribute to this podcast,
