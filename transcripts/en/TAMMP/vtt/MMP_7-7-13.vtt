1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:07.710
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday for Monday.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.660
Um,
July 8th how are you?
How is it going?
Wow,

4
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.200
this sounds really good to me.
I hope it sounded this good to you.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.730
I think I nailed it.

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.050
What's up with these levels is fucking phenomenal.
Some too.

7
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.610
She's now going to Twitter me or tweet me whatever.
Ooh,

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.770
truly like the treble was a little too high.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.520
Ah,
so was your mother when she was pregnant with

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.350
you fucking drunk.
Fetal cont years later.

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:43.590
Just walking around criticizing people and you know what?
It's not your fault.

12
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:47.760
It's because your mother,
first of all,
she was a horse.
Spread her legs,

13
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:50.230
no protection.
All the leaves,

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.300
leaves are brown and her legs.

15
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.530
I spread my legs as bay head.

16
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.590
Oh,
I could sing that whole song and annoy the shit out of you.

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.320
That's why I want to hear from next week people's whose mothers were whores and

18
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:13.980
they drank during pregnancy.
I want to hear what you think about world events.

19
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.150
That's what I want to hear.
Is that what you want to hear it?
Yeah,
it is.

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.290
It is what I want to hear.
It's my podcast.
It is what I want to hear.
Um,

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.910
I'm loving Twitter and I fucking hate it by the way.

22
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:29.880
I got to stop reading comments.
It's always people fucking correct.
And you,

23
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.200
you know,
I got this European tour coming up and someone was saying,
hey,

24
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.080
you're doing any of the smaller cities.
And I was like,
no,

25
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:38.430
just pretty much all I said,

26
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.690
all the capitals and it was like 10 countries and one fucking country.

27
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:44.960
It wasn't the capitol.
And I got like 20 people.

28
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.550
<v 2>Oh,
[inaudible] Stuart lose not Blair's go.
He jokes</v>

29
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.730
<v 1>and it'll probably just be a nice,</v>

30
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.260
they probably actually in reality in their heads when they were typing it,

31
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:59.260
they were actually going like,
I'm not trying to be Douche,
just letting you know.

32
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.380
It's not Glasgow and Edinburgh.
I'm just trying to help out.

33
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.770
This is just me over here in the back over here in my corner of the Internet,

34
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:09.160
just trying to help out.
That's probably how they were typing it.

35
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.530
But I'm such a negative Douche that I hear it in my head is,

36
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.573
<v 2>oh,</v>

37
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.030
<v 1>that's how I hear it.</v>

38
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.570
That's basically how I hear anybody telling me that I'm doing anything wrong or

39
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.800
you like me.
Isn't that exactly everybody,
all of a sudden,

40
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.300
no matter what language they're speaking,
like some fucking Asian person,
right.

41
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.510
Or some Asian motherfucker,
right.
To keep it clean.

42
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.680
I'm call back to a special,
whenever the fuck I did that one,
um,

43
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.960
came up to me and we speaking out,

44
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:44.080
got her done Mike and see if he was up there speaking Asian,

45
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.210
if he was talking in his native language,
Korean,
whatever.
And it sounded like,

46
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.140
you know,
you know,
I thought,
I thought that was like right.

47
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.170
I would hear that like that if he was talking to somebody else.

48
00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:59.980
But like if he felt I'd pulled into his parking spot,
it would just be like,

49
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.040
oh dog.
Which is just immediately sound like this guy.
He's a content,

50
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.190
you know,

51
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.190
even if I stole his spot and even if I knew he was right and I was wrong in the

52
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:17.290
moment,
I'm such a Dick that I,
I would,
I would,

53
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.770
I would block out that voice in my head going,
you know,
this guy's right,

54
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.030
this guy is right,
you know,
insulted them a little bit,
a little bit,
you know,

55
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.150
you kind of took his spot.
I would still block that out.

56
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.380
But the only thing that I can take positive out of it is as far as any sort of

57
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.720
like level of maturity that I have gained throughout my adult life is,

58
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.430
uh,
I,
at least now I recognize that I do that and I,
I'm actually,

59
00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:48.520
I've gotten good enough that within 10 minutes of actually whoever I just called

60
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:49.710
the cunt and driving away,

61
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.090
I actually Kinda admit out loud in the car going in the car to myself going
like,

62
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:58.950
you know,
like I was right pill,
you kind of worry you were kind of the Douche.
So,

63
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.580
you know,
I try and get on your bad side,
but just next time let's try to,

64
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.440
you know,
try to hear the other person try to apologize.

65
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.620
Um,
so anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

66
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.310
I like seeing it that way.
This is the Monday morning podcasts.

67
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:20.490
Like when they say the Ohio State University,

68
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.980
which is one of the funniest bragging things ever.

69
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.760
You bragging about a state school when you fucked up in high school and you live

70
00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:31.890
in Ohio and you can't go to any real university.

71
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.610
Then this is the college that you end up at.

72
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.070
Oh,
they love that one in Michigan.
But University of Michigan,

73
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:46.010
that's a state school too,
right?
Those are such weird schools.

74
00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:48.890
Like University of Michigan,
right?
It's,
it's a state school.

75
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.510
So anybody did a keg stand instead of studying for math goes in and they live in

76
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:57.620
Michigan.
You end up there.
It's why their stadium.
That's where the fucking state,

77
00:04:57.621 --> 00:05:02.590
he was so big,
you know,
bad banana.
Yay.

78
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.730
100,000 fucking people.
Do you think it's because the football programs,

79
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.420
is that good or it because that many people got a c in math in Michigan?

80
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.520
That's my question for you.
But if you,
if you live out of state,

81
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.120
it's like nine zillion dollars and you gotta be like a fucking,
you know,

82
00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:22.340
half a physicist to get in there.
And you know,
it's funny,

83
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.200
I don't even know what a physicist does.
Do they study?
Physis

84
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.620
oh,
look at that over there.
Is that a physicist?
I Dunno.

85
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.240
How would you know I'm a physicist wants to do,
sorry.

86
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.300
The fuck is a fist as that physics,
are they the ones who study the inertia?

87
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.460
Um,
wow.
This is new level of ignorance.

88
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.840
Do you like that about this podcasts that rather than seeing me grow as a
person,

89
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:55.740
I'm,
I'm slowly regressing.
You know,
maybe you were already ahead of me.

90
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.610
Maybe you were a couple steps behind me.
Now they,
all of you,

91
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.140
it's like I'm that guy.
Like it's a foot race.
Right?
And I came out of the tracks,

92
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.770
uh,
out of the blocks,
sprinting,
you know,
now grabbing my sign.

93
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.960
You guys are just going around me,
you're still going to come.
And seventh,

94
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.520
you're not winning a medal,
but you beat me.
Right?

95
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.480
Makes you feel better,
doesn't it?
Well,
what does that say about you?

96
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.970
When we come back,
we'll be talking.
Um,
I went for a bike ride.

97
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.460
Go ahead and laugh.
It's a great thing to do.
I'm trying to keep the weight down,

98
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.450
you know,
because I read somewhere on the Internet,
you know,

99
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.000
and it was typical research on the Internet where you have a question and you're

100
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:41.870
just like,
ah,
you know,
why is the moon round?

101
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.010
Why is it round by the way?
Why if it wasn't just a block out there,

102
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.720
what would happen?
Ah,
Jesus,
he's 80 standup presence.

103
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.870
A presence premises is that I'm just throwing out here.

104
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.780
That would probably still work in the outer reaches of fucking Iowa.
Um,

105
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.180
any question you fucking have,

106
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.290
you go Google it on the Internet and then immediately you click on basically the

107
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:13.550
first fucking website you find you'll read it and you just take that as law.

108
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.040
At least I do.
That's what I do.
So one time,
I don't know how I came across this,

109
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:24.041
but they said basically every pound of fat on your body is another five miles of

110
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:28.040
capillaries that you have.
Your heart has to pump,

111
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.260
which is why even just be in five,
10 pounds over can significantly.

112
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.140
I did use that word and I did pronounce it correctly,
Sig,

113
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.410
that's five syllable word,
and everybody decrease your lifespan.

114
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.853
<v 0>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.300
<v 1>You know,
I mean,
how would you like it if every day,
right?</v>

116
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.170
You had to drive an extra five,
10 miles to work.
That's probably not a big deal,

117
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:54.050
but who's a pound overweight?
You know,

118
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:56.030
who's two pounds overweight after a certain age,

119
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.450
everybody's at least 10 15 pounds over.
Right.

120
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.920
What's 15 times five real quick?
That's 75 people.

121
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.200
What does he had to go an extra 75 miles to and from work everyday.

122
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.430
What kind of a fucking mood would you be?
Huh?

123
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.650
How much would your kids be running for their lives when you came walking up the

124
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:18.830
door,
up the path to the door.
That's what yeah,

125
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.970
is doing every time.
It beats when you're that fucking heavy.

126
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

127
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.870
<v 1>Just that heavy.
If forget about these ticket time bombs,</v>

128
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:31.170
then I'll walk around 30 pounds overweight,
but there's still lifted weights.

129
00:08:31.171 --> 00:08:36.090
Do it.
I'm alright.
You know,
touch my gut dude.
It's fucking Charlotte.
Yeah,

130
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:40.800
it's because you're fat.
You're fat is calcified.
It's so entrenched there.

131
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:44.370
It has squatter's rights right in front of your stomach.
You dumb fuck.

132
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.170
I love fat people who sit,

133
00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:51.171
they skiff fucking fat and then they tell you how fucking the hard their stomach

134
00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:54.630
is and they think it's like abs.
It isn't.

135
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.620
It's the fat is fucking jammed in there so tightly.

136
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.210
Like back in the day when they used to pack people into subway sneezed at
levels,

137
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.750
literally a job.

138
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.940
Your job was the fucking just leaning on the people and pack them in.

139
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.880
You know what I mean?
Oh my God.

140
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.570
That was the worst time in society for claustrophobic people slash the greatest

141
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:22.200
time ever for perverts.
You know,

142
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.780
it's just the entire spectrum.

143
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.500
Complete Fair to absolute ecstasy depending on who you are on that subway train.

144
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.180
But anyways,
that's what it is.

145
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.840
It's all you fatties out there who sit there and your fucking stomach is harder

146
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:43.890
than your head.
That's not abs.
That's not you.
Like,

147
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:46.770
oh well you know I'm so fat.
Every time I do is sit up in bed.

148
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:48.480
It's like I got a 45 pound,

149
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.310
you know weight number that you'd do that back in the eighties you put like it

150
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:57.420
wasn't enough to do set up.
She always had to add weight.
If you're doing dips,

151
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:00.000
they had that shit that literally looked like it was hanging like a fucking

152
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:01.620
metal tea bag hanging off of you.

153
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.800
You put the chain around your waist and then you'd hang weights off of that go.

154
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.440
He's fucking Dell and depths with like fucking two 25 hanging off his balls kid.

155
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.550
Right?
All that dumb shit.
That's what,
that's what fat people ethic.

156
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.930
They think I know a lot pap fat people right now.

157
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:20.730
Like why you always coming down or not?
So I'll tell you why.

158
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:24.420
Cause this kick a ginger day and I've never seen a fat person come to my rescue.

159
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.050
You don't give a fuck about me.
I don't give a fuck about you.

160
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:32.550
That's how it works.
Fatty.
All right with you.
Swollen face.

161
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.593
Um,

162
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.550
this is so unnecessarily mean right now.
I don't even know how I got onto this,

163
00:10:42.551 --> 00:10:46.450
but I,
I have to see it through because I got an hour to do here.
People.

164
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.200
All right.
The fuck I was talking about pack.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

165
00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:54.130
So I think these fat people with the hard stomachs,

166
00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:58.300
they feel like when they just sit up in bed,
you know,

167
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:03.650
and they make that noise as they go to sit up and it just said,
right.

168
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.520
They think that's like,

169
00:11:06.521 --> 00:11:11.290
that's why their stomach so hard rather than it's just jam packed with Syrup,

170
00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:13.900
a new get in pancake batter

171
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.330
and all that other fucking gooey shit.
You know that they eat.

172
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.650
I'll tell you right now,
I think they should just get all those,

173
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.570
just get all the fatties and just get them out of the fucking country.
You know,

174
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.010
you bringing us down,
we've had it,

175
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.900
we had it with your kind.
They should stick all the fatties on a fucking island.

176
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.780
I want to run for political office at a very low level preaching like,

177
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.750
like what sounds like racism or nationalism,
but it,
it kind of affects,

178
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:53.710
everybody likes this fat people in every,
every race except the Asians.

179
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:55.930
It's very few Asians.
Every once in a while you see a fat Asian,

180
00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.010
you just know he's hanging out with like Americans.
You know what I mean?

181
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:04.000
It's like there's no way you got fat eating a fucking great diet that you guys

182
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:06.970
have over there.
I don't know what it is over there,
but like,

183
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.680
people are in fucking shape and Asia,
you know,

184
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.060
I don't know about the Russians,
all that vodka that they're sucking down.

185
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:17.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

186
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.823
<v 1>Um,</v>

187
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.880
how many more people can I offend in the first fucking 10 minutes as podcasts?

188
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.320
I'll 12 minutes in.
Okay.
That's okay.

189
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.870
So I've got a new 10 minutes to offend people.
Um,

190
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.510
yeah,
I think they should just run for office.

191
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

192
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.170
<v 1>And just,
just be like,
I get the fatties out of town.</v>

193
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.870
I get those fucking people,
uh,
yields people.

194
00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:40.610
You say hello and they don't say hello back.

195
00:12:40.611 --> 00:12:43.220
They just smile and it's a fake smile.

196
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.620
I know I've talked about this in my podcast.

197
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.000
There was somebody when I lived in New York,

198
00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:51.560
used to do that and I fell for it like the first 67 times I'd be walking down

199
00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:52.640
the hall and this

200
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.940
would be walking the other way with her fucking kids and always just be,

201
00:12:58.941 --> 00:13:02.330
I'd be like,
Hey,
good morning.
Or Hey,
after I,
you know,
hello or good afternoon,

202
00:13:02.331 --> 00:13:04.460
whatever the fuck you say.
Right.
Big fucking wave.

203
00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:08.690
A fellow human being being polite,
how are ya?

204
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.760
Alright.
And she would always do the same thing.
She tilts her head to the side,

205
00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:17.490
like she was gone.
Aw.
And then she do this smile,
which she,

206
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.540
she wouldn't show any teeth,
just like the Jay Leno smile.

207
00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:23.900
And then her eyes would,
would like squint up.
Like she was looking into the sun,

208
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.510
big stupid red lipstick.
And every fucking time I was just like,
oh,

209
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.860
what if I just fucking punched her right in the face,
made her kids cry.

210
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.400
And I just laughed.
I didn't laugh.
I just walked away.

211
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.700
You know?
I'd still be effected.

212
00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:42.890
That'd be a part of my soul that I lost when I did it.

213
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.230
But I'll tell you in that moment,
and nap catcher,

214
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:48.850
right as she closes her eyes,

215
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.293
<v 0>you know,</v>

216
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.960
<v 1>like a fucking off Samuelson move.</v>

217
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.160
Don't even drop the glove keeping on and it just blast or right in the face.

218
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.010
And I wanted to do that every fucking time.

219
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:01.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

220
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.460
<v 1>And then finally one day she walked towards me and I was walking towards her and</v>

221
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.570
uh,
she actually started to anticipate me saying hello,

222
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.060
because we're looking right at each other and I'm in my head just going,

223
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.860
I'm not saying anything,
I'm not saying hello to this bitch says hello to me.

224
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.990
This is another thing that makes you die early.

225
00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.663
<v 0>You know,</v>

226
00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.430
<v 1>he's fucking literally sitting in your apartment,</v>

227
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.150
you little ass shoe box of apartment in New York,
plotting,

228
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.430
scheming,
conspiring.
Uh,

229
00:14:32.431 --> 00:14:36.230
how are you going to fucking not say a load of this bitch sit next time you see

230
00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:38.600
her,
you know,
as you're eating a bacon,

231
00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:42.170
egg and cheese and added an extra couple of miles for you had to beat every

232
00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:46.260
couple of times,
right?
So anyway,
she comes walking at me,
I'm walking around,

233
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.580
I'm like,
I'm not fucking saying hello this time,
you know?

234
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.610
And we got right to the where it's like,
who's going to blink?

235
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.110
And I timed it perfectly.

236
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.880
She anticipated me saying hello when she started to tilt her head and I fucking

237
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.130
did my impression of what she did.

238
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.680
And I of course did it completely over the top.

239
00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:06.530
Like I literally laid my head on my shoulders,
squinted my eyes,

240
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.570
and I made this ridiculous face and continued to walk and she never looked at me

241
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:12.404
in the hall again.

242
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.720
And this is the genius of it.
She just,

243
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.940
it's not like she knows what the fuck she looks like.
I'm so self involved.

244
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:27.080
I assume she totally understood my point,
what I was trying to make,
you know,

245
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.070
like say hello,
stop making that stupid face.
She probably looked at like,

246
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:34.130
what the fuck is what that guy,
he has some sort of mental tick.

247
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.470
I don't want him around my children,
but you know what?

248
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:41.230
It made me feel better.
And you know what?

249
00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:45.400
That is what this podcast is all about.
Um,
hey people,

250
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.700
have you ever heard a Tivo?
But where the hell your bed?

251
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

252
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.100
<v 1>Well you got,
you got your head up,
your Aa Devos,
the greatest.
Especially,</v>

253
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:58.970
you know,
we really appreciate it.
An old fella like myself,
you know why?

254
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:02.600
Cause back in the day back in,
I gotta explain this to you guys.

255
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:06.380
Back in the day when you miss something,
you just missed it.
It was over,

256
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.120
or at least on the,
if you didn't see it in the movie theater,
that's it.

257
00:16:11.121 --> 00:16:15.180
You missed it.
There was no Netflix,
there was no,
uh,

258
00:16:15.181 --> 00:16:19.640
the shop than.com that you watch it on.
I don't know.

259
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.980
It was over.
You missed it.

260
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.760
Evil Knievel was going to jump over 20 buses,

261
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.420
but for some reason your parents wanted you to take it a pewter pot to go get a

262
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:33.590
muffin and you missed it.
And the next day you were down at the bus stop at,

263
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.890
everyone was talking about it and you were a man without a country.

264
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

265
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.510
<v 1>And you knew eventually it was going to come around to you and they were like,</v>

266
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:46.250
did you see it?
And you were like,
no.
Well you didn't see it.
No,
I didn't see it.

267
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.310
I was getting muffins with my parents and then just a rain of book bags would

268
00:16:51.441 --> 00:16:53.600
just be smashing you over the head and that's what happened.

269
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:58.880
But thankfully that never happens to children anymore because the Tiva back in

270
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:01.130
the day,
TV was weirdly had to watch.

271
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.880
You only watch a show at a certain time and if you missed it or even part of it,

272
00:17:04.881 --> 00:17:08.720
you literally had to wait for it to go into reruns before you could see it
again.

273
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.340
Tivo has totally changed all of that and while other DV eyes exist,

274
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.260
they're not as awesome as Tivo.
You know why?
Because if you have cable,

275
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.640
cable TV lets you watch your shows wherever you want.
With Tivo Stream,

276
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.660
you can watch on your iPad all over your house and even transfer your favorite

277
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:31.580
recordings and take them with you on an airplane waiting in line at the DMV

278
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.910
dentist's office.
You can be sitting there watching all of the Sopranos.

279
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.670
Tivo makes a other dvrs look like they were designed by the Soviet community.

280
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.470
I like this copy.
Only Tivo reaches both cable and web to find any movie,

281
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.950
any show,
any video at the press of a button.
All right,

282
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.660
so there you go.
From the couch to the kitchen from the minivan to 35,000 feet,

283
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.690
Tivo makes TV 100,000 times better.

284
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.300
So why don't you do yourself a huge favor and go get some,

285
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.830
go get yourself some Tivo.
Have you heard about that?
Tivo?

286
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.510
Oh my God,
I want to get some.
Um,
all right,

287
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.900
let's do one other here.
Then we'll get back to a dollar shave club.
Everybody.

288
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.540
How many times have you walked into cvs and said,
hey,

289
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:20.450
I need a the triple blade plus,
uh,
can I get one of those?
And they go,
yet,

290
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.270
that'll be $68.
And you're like $68.
So like,
yeah,

291
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.340
that's why we keep it locked behind the case here,

292
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:31.341
like at some vintage guitar rather than some piece of plastic with a poor excuse

293
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:35.310
for metal to drag across your face.
That's going to be useless in five days.

294
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.040
You know,
probably ended up floating around in the ocean,

295
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:42.870
poking up some porpoises I,
why is that?
Thanks so much money.
You know why?

296
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:47.100
Cause it's a scam.
We'll finally,
the cavalry is here when it comes to shaving,

297
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.070
um,
dollar shave club.

298
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.910
Everybody getting in good shape can be a real pain in the age,

299
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.920
searching through 50 brands,
making new blades,

300
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.990
matching new blades to old handles,

301
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.050
bullshit features where your razors doubles as a flashlight,

302
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:05.610
a toothpick and et cetera.
20 bucks for new razors to hell with that,

303
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:10.590
go to dollar shave club.com to get high quality razors delivered to your door

304

305
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.400
And that Greg no longer standing in line at those long lines at cvs when you're

306
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:21.120
behind anyone from a doctor to some crack addict waiting to get,

307
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.570
try to find the one person working on the Florida unlocked the raises.

308

Now they deliver them right to you for a fraction of the cost.

309
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.021
They've made it simple,

00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:31.740
high quality raises a hundred percent guaranteed sent on scheduled so you never

311
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:33.300
have to think about it again.
Every month.

312
00:19:33.301 --> 00:19:36.810
You get a new pack every week you change your blade and it costs a fraction of

313
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:40.860
what you pay at retail.
Um,
you've want to support this show.

316
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:51.510
There you go.
Look at me.
Look at me,
saving you money,
saving you money.

317
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.650
So it's been a hell of a week everybody.
It's always been hell of a week.

318
00:19:57.651 --> 00:19:59.370
You know,
if you try to stay up on world events,

319
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.060
there's always something crazy going on right over in Egypt.

320
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.290
You know where the Arab spring began as far as I can remember,
you know,

321
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:10.020
they elected a president and within a year they're like,
you know what,

322
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:13.790
we don't like this guy.
Why don't we have a new election?

323
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:18.050
And then the new guys like,
Nah,
Nah,
I'm in here.
I'm in here.
I'm not leaving.

324
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.120
And they go,
Oh yeah,
we think you are.
And he goes,
oh,
I don't think I am there.

325
00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:26.130
I bet you are.
I'm now,
I bet.
I bet.
I doubt.
I Bet I don't.
Next.

326
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:31.010
He know this riots in the streets,
you know,
when isn't it a hell of a week?

327
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:32.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

328
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.930
<v 1>Sorry.
Can you tell him searching for something as a way the fuck is it?</v>

329
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.980
I swear to God,
I swear to God.

330
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:44.840
This is the exact kind of thing that just slowly fucking drives me mad about

331
00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:47.740
these Goddamn fucking computers.
What did I do wrong this time?

332
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.330
Ghost of Steve Jobs and watch this.
I'm going to try to do this.

333
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:54.430
Move that it finally work.

334
00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:00.420
Did it finally work?
Oh,
here it is.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
Sorry.

335
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.633
<v 0>MMM.</v>

336
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.870
<v 1>Put it on.
Want to talk about,
oh,
I know Aaron Hernandez.
Everybody.</v>

337
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.350
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

338
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.183
<v 1>You know what?</v>

339
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.610
One of the whole fucking hilarious things about Aaron Hernandez case is I'm

340
00:21:13.611 --> 00:21:18.611
fucking sitting here calling up my buddies and people are so into sports in

341
00:21:18.951 --> 00:21:19.784
Boston.

342
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

343
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.340
<v 1>Like the fact that somebody lost their life.
That's like,</v>

344
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.220
that's like on page 19 of this story.

345
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.340
I called my buddies back there and they're all like,
dough now.

346
00:21:31.341 --> 00:21:34.370
Now what are we going to do?
You know,
Bronx always getting hurt.

347
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.930
They traded fucking Welker.
Right?
Who's Brady going to throw to?

348
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.900
They don't.
They like,
they're not even thinking like,
you know,

349
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.930
sports kind of takes a back seat to this unbelievably like bizarre,

350
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.970
depressing,
sad,
horrific fucking story.
You know,

351
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.270
who gives a fuck if we can beat the dolphins are not,
you know,

352
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.910
I dunno.
There's a big,
there's a big pity party going on in Boston.
Look,

353
00:22:01.911 --> 00:22:05.930
oh my God,
this is like the worst week ever.
Well,
we had the greatest decade ever.

354
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.510
All right.
And I stand by that.

355
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.780
Anybody in any state in the United States,

356
00:22:11.781 --> 00:22:15.620
if you want to challenge the last 10 years of Boston sports,
bring it on.

357
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.870
Bring it on.

358
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.740
I want to know one of the fucking city that one off for the major titles.

359
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.890
Numerous times.
Three Superbowls,
two world series,

360
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.190
a Stanley Cup in an NBA championship within 10 fucking years.

361
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.840
Went to five Superbowls to Stanley Cup finals to NBA finals.

362
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.540
Fucking unbelievable.
All right.

363
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.800
And all you guys now who are gleeful and other in all your other sports towns

364
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:43.160
and you think you're going to fucking bug me with your little Cunty tweets?
No,

365
00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:44.180
that,
I know this.

366
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.990
You would cut off your one of your fucking sports watch sport watching balls to

367
00:22:51.801 --> 00:22:55.550
experience half the fucking success that Boston had over the last 10 years.

368
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.720
You would take this week of horror.
You would definitely trade it.

369
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.360
All right.
You would do it.

370
00:23:02.361 --> 00:23:05.570
You trade in your fucking Mark Sanchez Jersey.

371
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.060
Do I swear to God jets fans would,
would,

372
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.870
would take this week just to fucking make it back to the super bowl.

373
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.910
Do you know the last time the jets were in the Superbowl,

374
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.130
we hadn't even pretended to be on the moon yet?

375
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.200
Do you realize how long ago that was?

376
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.103
<v 0>You know</v>

377
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.490
<v 1>Richard Nixon was still,
it was a comeback story.</v>

378
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.840
He was like Travolta pulp fiction.
That's how fucking long ago it was there.

379
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.980
That's another thing they got do.
What if he gets acquitted?
Right.

380
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:42.060
And then he fucking signs with the jets.
You know,

381
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.360
that was actually my thought because I don't think as far as from what I've
seen,

382
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:52.361
unless his friends flip on them or unless they have some unbelievable piece of

383
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:56.180
evidence that they have not introduced to the public yet.

384
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.800
What you basically have is a mountain of circumstantial evidence against a

385
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:01.730
mountain of money.

386
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.520
And as far as my little experience of watching the court case,

387
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:12.500
the rich guy walk,
he was just an Aaron Hernandez waiting for a bus.

388
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.480
You know,
pimp my ride.
I'm driving a piece of shit,
a exhibit.

389
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:20.180
Can you put a fucking fish tank in the back of this thing?
Right.

390
00:24:20.181 --> 00:24:24.830
If he was something like that over working in a warehouse,

391
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:27.920
unloading trucks like,
oh Billy red face back in the day,
Don,

392
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:31.040
you're going to jail.
All right,
but you got,
you got,
you know,

393
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:32.930
<v 3>okay.</v>

394
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.140
<v 1>Fucking pro athlete money.
You can walk.
You know,</v>

395
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.210
some lay on ESPN wrote,

396
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:42.890
the dumbest article was saying that despite the fact of how quickly the Patriots

397
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.061
acted,

398
00:24:44.061 --> 00:24:48.290
once they found out all these allegations against Aaron Hernandez and released

399
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:52.940
him like this,
black mark will always forever,

400
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.390
forever everybody forever.
We'll stay in the patriots.

401
00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.410
Like if for some reason we don't steer the and into the sun and the next 300

402
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.010
years,

403
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:05.750
there's going to be people 300 years from now still talking about Aaron

404
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.650
Hernandez still thinking about it every time they see the Patriot logo is,

405
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:12.980
that isn't the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.

406
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.223
<v 3>You know</v>

407
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.450
<v 1>when you watch a Carolina Panthers game,</v>

408
00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:20.760
when was the last time you thought about Ray Carus

409
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.353
<v 3>get out?</v>

410
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.210
<v 1>Nobody remembers.
Nobody fucking remembers.
This will be something dude.</v>

411
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:32.240
You know that was a guy in the Kansas city chiefs that killed his whole family

412
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:37.070
and then himself after football.
I don't know what,

413
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:39.960
maybe he got hit in the head too many.
I don't know what happened,
Dude.

414
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.280
I never heard of the story until Len Dawson brought it up.

415
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.383
It goes away.

416
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:51.910
Do you know a guide on the jets used to take his dick out in port,

417
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.900
the port authority.
He died his pubes grain and he'd fall,

418
00:25:56.901 --> 00:26:00.200
can shake his dick at people,

419
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.063
<v 3>you know,</v>

420
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.490
<v 1>and it was so shocked looking at his green pubes.</v>

421
00:26:05.491 --> 00:26:10.491
I never took the longest time before somebody finally looked at his face and

422
00:26:10.801 --> 00:26:11.431
then they,
uh,

423
00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:15.030
then they arrested him and no one ever thinks about that when they watch a jets

424
00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:19.380
game.
Do they see that's my point.
You guys can look all this up.

425
00:26:19.381 --> 00:26:23.520
This all,
I don't know if you find the last one,
but the other ones you'll find,

426
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.870
oh,
Jesus.

427
00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.220
<v 4>Joe,
what do you think if they turned,</v>

428
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.240
put dry a into a flanker they could join the combination of him and that Jesus

429
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.430
Freak.
They could somehow make up for Hernandez going to jail.

430
00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.810
<v 1>Um,
all right.</v>

431
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.140
I don't even know what I'm talking about right now to be honest with Ya.
Hey,

432
00:26:46.141 --> 00:26:49.140
this weekend,
speaking of Boston,
I'm going to be a,

433
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.340
I'm going to be doing with the Cape Cod Melody Tent.
Why?
How come,
why did I,

434
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.950
did I just add a syllable to Melton mellow melody,

435
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.190
the Cape Cod Melody tent in Hyannis.

436
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.800
Is it in Hyannis somewhere down near the Kennedy compound.
They sit,

437
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:08.310
they're spending all their fucking booze money down there.

438
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.960
It was not what they did.
The prohibition money,
the red side of trading money.

439
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.700
Um,
I have no idea what the fuck they did.
All I know is they don't,

440
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:22.110
they have a big yellow house and they go out and they played touch football.

441
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:23.700
That turns into tackle football.

442
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:29.370
And then it just big family fight because they're like a bunch of pit bulls or

443
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:33.750
if they fuck that gene out of there,
their family at this point,

444
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:36.120
it's just all watered down.
You know,

445
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.620
too many weak men and women brought into the fold.
You know,

446
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.740
you ever think about that shit?
Like when Pete,
you know,

447
00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:48.741
what's the worst thing ever is when somebody gives the son or daughter of a

448
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:52.290
father,
a mother that accomplished something great.

449
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.680
They always give the kids shit.
Like it's the kid's fault.

450
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:01.070
Like if you're the son of fucking Michael Jordan or the daughter of Amelia

451
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:06.360
Earhart,
um,
people will always be like,
dude,

452
00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:09.390
you're not,
you're not as good as your father,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And they blame you.

453
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.750
It's like,
it's not my fault that I'm half cut with my mom.

454
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.430
You know,
my dad can jump out of the gym.

455
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.970
My mother trips over a mop handle every fucking three days.

456
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.800
So I got 50% of that and me weighing me down.
I can still dunk.

457
00:28:27.801 --> 00:28:30.890
But no,
I can't take off from the foul line.
That's not my fault.

458
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.320
It has nothing to do with my desire or my heart or anything like that.

459
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.160
It has to do with my mother.
And the same thing with like Amelia Earhart's kid.

460
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.880
If she had a kid,
I don't know,
she probably didn't have a kid.

461
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.100
No guy can handle that.

462
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:51.260
Back in the day when she was supposed to be in the fucking kitchen making sugar

463
00:28:51.261 --> 00:28:55.070
cookies,
she's out there flying around doing better than the guys

464
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:01.540
match.
Why I had a dick shape.
I'm not fucking that her hair so short,
right?

465
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.950
No guy can handle that.
I have no idea.
Did she have a kid?

466
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.810
Did she take them on the trip?
Maybe that's why she crashed.
You know,

467
00:29:11.811 --> 00:29:15.310
if the kid was acting up,
she was reaching back trying to slap him in the face,

468
00:29:15.311 --> 00:29:19.000
like how you could as a parent back then.
And,
uh,
she went into the ocean.

469
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.700
Who knows?
Who knows why these things happen?
Everybody,
I don't,

470
00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:28.090
I don't pretend to know.
And you know what?
More importantly,
I don't want to know.

471
00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.200
But anyways,
back to the,
to the Boston sports things.
Boston fans,
you know,
not,

472
00:29:32.201 --> 00:29:34.360
you're not all crying,
but the ones who are bitching,

473
00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.850
I don't want to fucking hear it.
All right.

474
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:42.370
Quit your fucking crying and everyone else in your other towns try enjoy this

475
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.640
week as much as you can because we'd been kicking all your fucking ass for 10

476
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:49.780
years.
And you know,
it's true,
at least mostly true.
You know,

477
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.810
the only people give a shit as giants fans.

478
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.870
And that's just when it comes to football,
right?

479
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.280
But some of them are Yankee fans.

480
00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.050
And I'll take those two Superbowl losses for what we did to the Yankees in 2004.

481
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.250
I'll take that all day long.
Now there's one that will live forever,

482
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.830
that unlike the Hernandez thing,

483
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.830
that will live forever because you know what's great about it,

484
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:15.700
there's no way to beat it.
There's no way to beat it.

485
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.050
And even though TV,
even the Bruins lost four in a row and hockey.
Right,

486
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.920
but we didn't have the level of fucking hall of fame.

487
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.720
It's fucking great.

488
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:31.470
It'd be like if Babe Ruth Lou Gehrig and you had Dimaggio and Mickey Mantle all

489
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:33.970
on the same thing,
I know what you guys are saying.
That's not true.

490
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:37.480
When I say fuck you,
fuck you and your pin stripe heart.

491
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.570
It's true the way you guys,
we'll load it up a free agent.

492
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:42.130
She couldn't do that back in the day.

493
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.160
Back in the day he had to fucking earn it as opposed to now we can go out and

494
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:48.040
buy it.
Los Angeles Lakers,
you know?

495
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.400
Anyways,
I love how Dwight Howard,

496
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:56.720
Dwight Howard leaves the Lakers and they're sitting there questioning his heart

497
00:30:56.721 --> 00:31:00.320
and all that and never once again,
never did they think,
well,

498
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.770
why would you want to leave?
Why would you want to leave?

499
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.850
Gee,
what could it be?
The fucking 800 pound gorilla?

500
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.570
How many great centers have to leave town saying,

501
00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:15.330
I really didn't have a good fucking time playing with all,

502
00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:16.620
what's his face over there?

503
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.640
How many hall of fame coaches have to write books where if you read through the

504
00:31:20.641 --> 00:31:23.350
subtext that kind of go,
hey,
that guy's kind of a cunt.

505
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:25.080
It's kind of a cut to be around.

506
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.420
You know who says that about somebody they won a championship with?
You know,

507
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.120
this is my impression of a Los Angeles Laker Fan.
As a parent,

508
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:37.890
uh,

509
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:42.120
the kid comes home if their kid was Aaron Hernandez and came home and actually

510
00:31:42.121 --> 00:31:44.490
admitted to murdering two people,
and then the third one,

511
00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.800
you know what the mother and father would do,

512
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.430
they would stand up on the coffee table and they would start chanting MVP.

513
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.330
All right?
That might be,
admittedly,
that's a little harsh,

514
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:03.260
but I'm just saying I am a less than impressed with the average knowledge of

515
00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:09.420
sports that a Laker fan has.
It's just fucking dumb.

516
00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:10.740
I'm just dumbfounded,

517
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:15.390
dumbfounded that not in not even once did you ever boot Koby Bryant when he

518
00:32:15.391 --> 00:32:18.750
walked off the court on your whole fucking team.
I just said,
fuck ag.

519
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:22.960
Trying to think
of a major city that would put up with that.

520
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:28.900
I Dunno.
Anyways,
maybe it's the sun.
Maybe it's the pot cookies.

521
00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:32.800
I don't know what.
Anyways.
All right.
Here we go.
We got,

522
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.720
we got some fucking,
uh,
we got some letters.
All right.

523
00:32:37.721 --> 00:32:40.130
Billy Bean bag is a new one.

524
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:44.840
Billy Bean from the Oakland A's Billy Bean bag.
I get it.
Beanbag.

525
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.560
A a revolutionary chair dude.
How bad was it?

526
00:32:49.561 --> 00:32:51.890
Bean bag for the environment when she threw that thing out.

527
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:57.170
It was made out of this,
this blend.
You're like when they blend like a scotch,

528
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.940
not scotch.
Yeah.
Scotch is this guy.
I don't fucking know.
A whiskey.
It's a blend.

529
00:33:00.941 --> 00:33:05.540
A wine where you pour like a cabernet inter Merlow some real white trash shit.

530
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:08.150
This is like that,
that this is the chair version of that.

531
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.350
It was like a pillow.
It was a chair.

532
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.910
It was a fat person's stomach.
It was everything,
right?

533
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.360
It was food that astronauts eight out in space.

534
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.010
I think it was like filled with like,
I dunno,
like these little,

535
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.290
whatever the fuck you call those things.

536
00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:30.870
What are those things in the coffee cups used to be made out of and you'd sit

537
00:33:30.871 --> 00:33:35.400
there and scratch them and let it go into the environment back in the 70s before

538
00:33:35.401 --> 00:33:40.260
you realize that birds were inhaling it and it was like Agent Orange or minor

539
00:33:40.261 --> 00:33:44.100
long or something black lung.
Is that what it was?
Gee,
I don't know bill,

540
00:33:44.101 --> 00:33:46.740
you're the one who started riffing on beanbags and realize that you didn't even

541
00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:48.720
know what material it was made of.
Styrofoam.

542
00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.880
They were filled with styrofoam and then like the outside of it was like a blend

543
00:33:53.881 --> 00:33:58.440
of like plastic,
vinyl and uh,
you know,

544
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.140
some sort of treated waste.

545
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.193
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

546
00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:07.540
<v 1>And then you had the upscale ones where they are actually made out of the lab.</v>

547
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:13.780
Uh,
my dad,
we got a bunch of bean bags and they were all plastic,

548
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.160
vinyl hunks of shit,

549
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:20.470
but his was a leather one and we just think it was the shit big fucking,

550
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:25.570
and you'd grab it,
right?
This is how you set up a B bag.
You grab it by the top,

551
00:34:25.571 --> 00:34:28.780
like how your mother used to pick you up by your hair before she hit you with a

552
00:34:28.781 --> 00:34:32.720
wooden spoon.
You know,
cause you're watching cartoons.
Um,

553
00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:37.630
instead of doing your homework back when you could hit children in public or the

554
00:34:37.631 --> 00:34:39.460
safety of your own home,
when he had company,

555
00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:43.900
you'd pick it up and give it a shake,
right?

556
00:34:43.901 --> 00:34:48.580
And then you would just push it right down the middle and then you'd sit on the

557
00:34:48.581 --> 00:34:53.581
fucking thing and it was horrifically uncomfortable and it's a good five years

558
00:34:53.801 --> 00:34:56.170
before people realized it.
You know,

559
00:34:56.171 --> 00:34:59.350
when people just bought them because everybody else had them.
Oh it's so easy.

560
00:34:59.351 --> 00:35:01.750
You can move them around the rom look how easy it is.

561
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:06.090
The vacuum under and I can pick it up and vacuum.
I see.

562
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:10.960
Can't do that with a chair.
Um,
I wonder where all of those ended up.

563
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.440
<v 3>You know,
you know who gives a fuck,
right?</v>

564
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.110
<v 1>Sitting here reminiscing about chairs from the early seventies.
All right,</v>

565
00:35:20.111 --> 00:35:23.590
Billy Bean bag.
Have you heard of Justin Carter?

566
00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:29.070
This 19 year old kid has been in jail since March for making a sarcastic remark.

567
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.300
Here's an excerpt from a report,
uh,

568
00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:37.470
after a Facebook friend with whom he played video games,

569
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:40.350
described him as crazy and messed up in the head.

570
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.760
Carter replied sarcastically.
One imagines,

571
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.430
uh Oh yeah,
I'm really messed up in the head.

572
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.960
I'm going to shoot up a school full of kids and eat.

573
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.800
They're still beating hearts.
He added lol and j k.

574
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.360
Just kidding.
For good measure for this.
He was arrested by Austin police,

575
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.200
charged with making a terrorist threat and thrown into prison.

576
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.090
He may language there until the start of the next decade.

577
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:13.320
Get the fuck Outta here.
Crazy stuff,
Bill.
This isn't Russia.

578
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:14.460
Is this Russia?

579
00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.260
<v 0>Okay,</v>

580
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.560
<v 1>I know.
So you do this is that Snowden shit.
This is like all of that,</v>

581
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:23.490
but just slowly becoming this fucking police state.

582
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.270
You know what it is to people.

583
00:36:26.271 --> 00:36:28.760
You've got to stop fucking putting shit down and print.

584
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.390
That's just keep it how we,
we used to say shit like that,

585
00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:33.710
but we set it on the playground.

586
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

587
00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:38.210
<v 1>You know?
Oh yeah.
Like,
I'm going to go shoot the principal and the head.</v>

588
00:36:38.211 --> 00:36:41.060
That's what you do,
you know,
fucking write it down on the guide.
You know,

589
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.020
by though it was there any sort of backlash against Facebook for basically

590
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:48.620
ratting out all US citizens,
you know,

591
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.310
turning us all into the man,
man.
You know,

592
00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.260
he is still using Facebook.
I barely used it anyways.

593
00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.533
<v 0>You know,</v>

594
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.900
<v 1>I still go there and I checked fucking emails,</v>

595
00:37:01.901 --> 00:37:05.510
but in the back of my head I'm like,
why am I using this guy's Cunty fucking a,

596
00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.220
what do you call it,
social media thing here.

597
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:11.963
<v 0>You know,</v>

598
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.650
<v 1>when he turned the fucking record,</v>

599
00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.260
how much money did he make to turn out and ran everybody out?

600
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:20.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

601
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.150
<v 1>Know,
I swear to God,</v>

602
00:37:22.151 --> 00:37:24.500
if you're one of those fucking people who's dumb enough to be like,
well,

603
00:37:24.501 --> 00:37:25.480
it's yeah,
the terrorist

604
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.210
<v 5>you got nothing to worry about.</v>

605
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.370
<v 1>Yeah.
I have no sympathy for you.
When I see you in the Fema camp with me,</v>

606
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.010
you know,
and that's what I'm going to do.

607
00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.180
That's the only way that's going to keep the joy in my heart is when I'm on the

608
00:37:40.181 --> 00:37:43.480
upper bunk in your,
in the lower bunk across the way.
I'm just going to,

609
00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:47.620
for the rest of my minutes on earth,
I'm just going to keep looking at you going,

610
00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:48.454
yeah.

611
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.130
<v 5>Are you going to worry about</v>

612
00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.520
<v 1>over and fucking over until basically beaten to death by the other people in</v>

613
00:37:58.091 --> 00:38:02.920
there?
Don't want to hear it anymore
on that.
Creeped me out.

614
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.263
Um,

615
00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.150
<v 0>okay.</v>

616
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.210
<v 1>I don't,
I don't know why this kid isn't it.
He's still in jail.</v>

617
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

618
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.910
<v 1>Uh,
I,
I don't know what to think about it.
I have to know,
you know.</v>

619
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

620
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.060
<v 1>Does he have a weird haircut and a trench coat that freaked them out?
I mean,</v>

621
00:38:19.061 --> 00:38:23.590
it is Texas.
Texas has always kind of been their own deal.
You know what I mean?

622
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.940
I mean,
they kill people in Texas the way they rescued dogs here in la.

623
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.840
So I don't know.
I feel about that.
I mean,

624
00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.950
as far as like population,
it's phenomenal.
But as far as their swift,
uh,

625
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.743
<v 0>I dunno,</v>

626
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.240
<v 1>I just can't imagine getting put to death for something he didn't do.</v>

627
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.290
And you walk in down there,
uh,

628
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.730
like how does that work in the afterlife when you go to get judged?

629
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.240
Are you allowed to yell at God at that point?

630
00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.360
Like when he starts,
you know,
reviewing your life,
you just stand there like,
dude,

631
00:39:00.361 --> 00:39:02.070
don't even fucking start with me.
Alright.
Right.

632
00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:06.240
Just open the goddamn gates already.
Okay.
You know how this story against,

633
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.530
you know everything,
right?
Oh,
I know everything.
Yeah.

634
00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.070
You knew everything except how to get me out of that.
How come you,

635
00:39:13.071 --> 00:39:15.830
how come you didn't help me or how come you,
you fucking helped every,
uh,

636
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:20.430
a bunch of people and then you just stopped talking to people,
you know,
hey,

637
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.670
hey,
let me finish.
Where was my burning Bush?

638
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.600
Where was that?
Well,
I'll write down,

639
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.220
um,
hey,
here's some inspirational shit here.
Somebody wrote.

640
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.340
So Miss [inaudible] some inspiration for the Monday morning podcast.

641
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.570
It says bill,
it's like that thing I read on the internet once said,

642
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:45.430
plant three rows of peace,
peace of mind,

643
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.460
peace of heart,
peace of soul.

644
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.270
I really hope nobody's eating is,
I read the rest of this plant,

645
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:56.690
three rows of squash,
squash and difference.

646
00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.090
Squash,
selfishness,
squash,
hate.

647
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:07.060
Oh,
Jesus is another one.
Plant three rows of lettuce.

648
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:13.090
Let us be kind.
Let us love one another.

649
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.360
Let us grow our own food.

650
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.553
<v 0>Oh,</v>

651
00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.730
<v 1>why?
All of that is great.</v>

652
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.950
And if everybody applied that the world would be such a wonderful place.

653
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.080
Why does that make you fucking,

654
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:36.090
you grind your teeth to listen to though what it can,
you know?

655
00:40:36.091 --> 00:40:39.930
That's a great question.
You know,
at least I consider it a great question.

656
00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:44.130
I'm in my own head here,
man.
It sounded awesome to me.
Seemed like a good thought.

657
00:40:44.131 --> 00:40:47.250
And then I said it and I was like,
wow,
how did I come up with that one?

658
00:40:47.251 --> 00:40:51.810
You guys might disagree,
but what?
Why is that?
Who doesn't want peace of mind?

659
00:40:51.811 --> 00:40:55.770
Peace of heart.
But you know why?
Because it's a fucking pun.
Ps of mine,

660
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.303
<v 0>you know,</v>

661
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:05.260
<v 1>squash,
indifference.
A lot of people don't know what indifference means.</v>

662
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

663
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.810
<v 1>And I,
I think I'm one of them in difference means you have,</v>

664
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:13.260
like when somebody goes,
do you want this?
You want that?
Hey,
I'm in different,

665
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.290
<v 0>okay.</v>

666
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:18.110
<v 1>I think it doesn't exist for me.
And you,
you don't,
you don't love it or hate it.</v>

667
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:23.390
You have absolutely no opinion on it whatsoever.
Um,
it,
which like,

668
00:41:23.391 --> 00:41:26.960
I don't know how to be like that.
I don't think anybody's in different,

669
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.500
that's like God,
like,
that's like a higher level of fucking thought in my world,

670
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.260
you know?
Hey,
what do you think about these drapes?
I immediately like,

671
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.220
you know,
they're all right.
I like them.
They're hideous.
I know.

672
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:42.260
Just look at something like,
what do you think about this?

673
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.110
I have no thought whatsoever.

674
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.980
I don't know what that is.
What are you think about this band?
Yeah,

675
00:41:51.981 --> 00:41:56.280
they're all right.
That's the closest I get to indifferent.
You know,
it built,

676
00:41:56.290 --> 00:42:00.710
why don't you look up the fucking word first before you make,
ah,
just takes time.

677
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:06.690
Fucking reading,
you know,
get a life.
Um,

678
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.500
speaking of rescuing dogs,
I was out with the lovely near the,
uh,

679
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.620
yesterday
and we were driving around looking at houses.

680
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:20.160
It's like something we like doing.
Um,
but it sucks because then you're,

681
00:42:20.161 --> 00:42:21.980
you're always there are always better than your house,

682
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:25.100
cause you never go out and look at houses that are the same as yours.

683
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.550
You're like,
hey,
let's go out,
look at Shit we can't afford.
Right.

684
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.470
You go in the house like,

685
00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.430
<v 6>oh my God,
this is awesome.</v>

686
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.400
<v 1>It just,
with every house,
you just kind of gone.
I live in a fucking tree fort,</v>

687
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.610
but it's still fun to do,
you know?

688
00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.450
And I feel like I'm actually helping the owner of the house because,
uh,

689
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.560
by going in there and I'm walking around,
you know,
anybody else who's in there,

690
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:51.200
they're thinking like,
Oh shit,
this guy might make an offer.
I got,

691
00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:53.360
I got to jump on this.
You know,

692
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:58.030
that's how I justify me just going in there and looking at people's closets.
Um,

693
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.360
so anyways,
that's what we were doing yesterday.
And,
uh,

694
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:08.090
so what did we do?
We went.
So we went to the grocery store.
Oh yeah.

695
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:11.690
To get some shit for dinner and next door there was this place where they had,

696
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:16.490
uh,
you don't rescue some dogs.
So she's just like,

697
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:19.370
oh,
let's go over and look at the dog.
It's like,
I don't want to go over there.

698
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.760
I don't want go over there and look up late.

699
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.550
Some chewed up fucking animal that's gonna make me feel fucking horrible and

700
00:43:25.551 --> 00:43:30.140
I'll be laying in bed thinking about the dog,
like in no country for old man,

701
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.380
when the dude sitting there laying there and he thinks about that guy that was

702
00:43:33.381 --> 00:43:37.490
asking for water,
Eh,
whatever he says that Gaf fuck it.
Right.

703
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.700
You got to go back there and next thing you know you got some psycho chasing.

704
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.740
Yes.
[inaudible] that's not gonna happen.

705
00:43:42.741 --> 00:43:46.250
But I'm just saying I'm going to be thinking I love dogs too much that I can't

706
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:48.480
go down and look at him cause now I'm going to be just fucking thinking about

707
00:43:48.481 --> 00:43:53.170
them.
So she's like,
I could fine.

708
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.680
Fine.
Just stop doing that.
Right.

709
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.920
So we go over there,

710
00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:01.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

711
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:06.910
<v 1>And we walk in and there's this fucking pit bull that's like two weight classes</v>

712
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:11.300
up from our dog.

713
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.200
Big Classic fucking beautiful pity head.

714
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:19.970
And I can't even tell you what color this thing was.
It was like,
um,

715
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.110
it wasn't Carmel,
it was like this almost sandy kind of color.

716
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

717
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.100
<v 1>With no white or anything,
just not patches,
just that color.</v>

718
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.340
The fucking dog was beautiful and it had to weigh every bit of 80 pounds,

719
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.340
all muscle.
And it was an absolute sweetheart.

720
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.380
Like he came in and the thing is just fucking doing that thing where it's

721
00:44:46.381 --> 00:44:49.080
wagging its tail so hard.

722
00:44:49.081 --> 00:44:52.800
It looks like it's shaking it's ass and it's walking sideways is you come up to

723
00:44:52.801 --> 00:44:57.180
it and it just buries that big head like right in your lap.

724
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:01.980
And then at one point I'm petting a thing and it just fucking just leans into me

725
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:04.020
like I was squat down like a ketchup patch,

726
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.270
petting it and it wants to be pet more.

727
00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:09.630
So it just sort of relaxed his body and leaned into me and literally like

728
00:45:09.631 --> 00:45:12.090
knocked me over and I fell down.

729
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:15.630
And then it went over and started like licking my face was a greatest fuck this,

730
00:45:15.631 --> 00:45:18.990
this all basically happen in about 11 seconds.

731
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.170
And then all of a sudden this lady comes walking over

732
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.360
and the most annoying I'm talking to a dog voice ever just comes walking in.

733
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.113
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

734
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.040
<v 1>That's fucking doing that.</v>

735
00:45:36.041 --> 00:45:41.041
And it was like my eyes started watering and I just fucking stood up and walked

736
00:45:42.611 --> 00:45:46.360
away.
Nia said something like,
okay.
And then that happened.

737
00:45:46.361 --> 00:45:50.290
She said something loud enough that the girl heard but she couldn't hear
anything

738
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.310
and whatever the dog's name was like Franklin choosing.
Yeah,

739
00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.680
no.
And that shit.
And just,
he just stood up and just fucking walked away.

740
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.360
So now I'm over the other side of the pet store buying shit bags is a Michael

741
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.590
Rappaport called the back of the day shitbags bags.
Um,

742
00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:14.260
<v 0>yeah,</v>

743
00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:17.830
<v 1>I fucking,
I'm buying those and within two seconds,</v>

744
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.050
this woman left with that dog.

745
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

746
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:26.510
<v 1>Like walked in,
saw it and just left with this 80 pound fucking dog.</v>

747
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

748
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.170
<v 1>And uh,</v>

749
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.140
<v 0>okay.</v>

750
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.670
<v 1>I had this such mixed emotions.
I was excited that the dog got rescued.</v>

751
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

752
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.300
<v 1>And I was bombed that that was the person that rescued it.</v>

753
00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:45.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

754
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.033
<v 1>You know?</v>

755
00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:46.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

756
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.900
<v 1>I don't know why she loved dogs the same way I did.
She did a great thing.</v>

757
00:46:50.901 --> 00:46:53.190
Like why should I be bumped?
She just fucking,
and you know what it was.

758
00:46:53.191 --> 00:46:54.860
It was I wanting to keep playing with the dog.

759
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.520
You came in with your fucking Jerry Lewis Voice from hell.

760
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.550
They just say from Hell yes I did.
It's the eighties comedy week.

761
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.730
Um,
all right.
What are we,

762
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:13.350
are we 47 minutes in cheese,
Luis?
All right,
let's continue on here.

763
00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.390
Oh,
I started to mention that I went on this bike ride by the way.
And a,

764
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:22.170
for those of you who live out here in la or are you coming to visit,

765
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:23.843
um,

766
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:29.010
you can actually ride a bicycle all the way up to the Hollywood sign.

767
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.750
And,
uh,

768
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:36.550
it is one of the hardest bike rides I've ever fucking been on.

769
00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.290
You keep seeing the sign and every time you go around a corner and you just

770
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:44.710
think this has to be the last fucking corn up before I'm up here,

771
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:50.570
you know?
And it just isn't and then it isn't and it isn't any,

772
00:47:50.571 --> 00:47:52.760
just keep fucking going and going and going.

773
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:57.790
It was like the ascent to use a word that's beyond my key vocabulary.

774
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.390
You already had to go all the way up the canyon,
just get to the,

775
00:48:04.391 --> 00:48:07.270
to the beginning of like,
okay,
now we're going to get to the summit here,

776
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.430
right to use mountain climbing,
Shit.

777
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:14.170
Just that a sin you already fucking road like a half hour just to get up there.

778
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.950
And then this is sent is I swear to God,
maybe 20,

779
00:48:17.951 --> 00:48:21.820
25 straight minutes of,
I don't know what it is,

780
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:25.330
45 degree angle.
It's fucking brutal.

781
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.520
And then at some points,

782
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.030
especially right at the end when it gets even like 60 degrees,

783
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.140
it's fucking ridiculous.
And uh,

784
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.780
I was beyond gasping for wheezing.

785
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:39.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

786
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:43.220
<v 1>I wrote and I stopped.
Right.
You know where they have the radio antennas?</v>

787
00:48:43.221 --> 00:48:44.720
You're actually above the sign,

788
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:50.360
got off the bike and grabbed the chain link fence and was gone.

789
00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.353
<v 8>Okay.</v>

790
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:58.370
<v 1>For fucking like five fucking,
I thought I was going to pass out.
Um,</v>

791
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.830
but you know what?
I probably knocked off some miles on the capillaries there.

792
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:09.020
Um,
so anyways,
but you know what's great as you going up,

793
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:12.140
there's all these guys dress like Lance Armstrong calming down and they all give

794
00:49:12.141 --> 00:49:14.390
you words of encouragement because they just did it,
you know,

795
00:49:14.391 --> 00:49:17.990
and I'm going up there on a mountain bike made for a lady.

796
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.650
So when I got for Nia that she never fucking road.
And uh,

797
00:49:21.651 --> 00:49:24.950
I love riding women's bicycles,
you know,

798
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:30.740
like women's bicycles that designed the way guys bicycle should be

799
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:32.640
<v 0>okay.</v>

800
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.170
<v 1>I always thought they had that reverse.</v>

801
00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:36.960
Well basically they shouldn't bang their clit on something metal,

802
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:41.490
although no one,
those psychos,
they probably fucking a joy.
It,
you know,

803
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.270
um,
harder.
Uh,

804
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:50.220
the way the woman's bicycle is fucking like this,

805
00:49:50.221 --> 00:49:54.490
so concerned about their dresses and you look it up and seeing that clam that

806
00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:58.480
once again seeing their clam is,
is,
you know,

807
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:02.610
hiding their clam is more important than somebody else's smashed testes.

808
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:04.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

809
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.390
<v 1>Um,
I go up to,</v>

810
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.200
it's not like the old school Schwinn one way and when all the way down to like

811
00:50:08.201 --> 00:50:08.741
your ankles,

812
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:13.420
but it's angled to the point where I can get my feet down and a old Ricky,

813
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:17.980
Ricky,
Bobby,
you're going to be okay.
You know,
so I don't have a problem with it.

814
00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:19.360
I have sort of a,
uh,

815
00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:24.100
an androgynous bike that I ride yet.
Oh,

816
00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:28.030
it's a mountain bike,
but it's not a guy's bike and it's not a bike is kind of,

817
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.570
it's,
you know,
it sounds a little questionable.
Don't I have,
I have the don't ask,

818
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:37.180
don't tell Huffy then I ride.
Um,

819
00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.650
and I'm not going to apologize for it,
you know,

820
00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.940
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
All right.
Got My ass kicked bill.

821
00:50:43.941 --> 00:50:47.480
I'll keep this short and sweet because I know how bad you are at reading things.

822
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.810
You know,
I can't even argue that,
uh,
he goes,
I live in a small city,

823
00:50:53.811 --> 00:50:58.370
roughly 90,000 people.
What do you live in China?
Is that a little village?

824
00:50:58.371 --> 00:51:02.420
Do 90,000 fucking people.
That's gigantic.

825
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:07.910
The nightlife district of the city has more or less 10 different bars or clubs.

826
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.230
I,
by the way,
before people are Dicks to me on the Internet.
I mean that's,

827
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.470
that's gigantic.
If you say that you,
you live in a small town,

828
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:20.450
well I guess it's small.
He said city.
Ah,
right.
You're right.

829
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.340
I'm an asshole.
Okay,
here we go.

830
00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:27.080
The nightlife district of the city has more or less 10 different bars or clubs.

831
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.560
Well,
how big are they?
If there's 90,000 people in there,

832
00:51:30.561 --> 00:51:32.210
you've got to think at least half of them drink

833
00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:38.580
10 bars or clubs get 4,500 people in each one.

834
00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.800
It doesn't make any sense.
Uh,

835
00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:44.790
last weekend I left all my friends at one bar to go meet up with a girl at

836
00:51:44.791 --> 00:51:49.530
another while there I was heavily intoxicated and grabbed the lady's ass I was

837
00:51:49.531 --> 00:51:50.250
meeting.

838
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:54.870
Apparently two drunk guys didn't take too kindly to this and decided to attack

839
00:51:54.871 --> 00:51:59.280
me and gave me a good baiting somehow.
I think you left some,

840
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.570
some details.
Did you grab the ass or the woman you were talking?
So,

841
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:05.463
um,

842
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.870
we're that her two older brothers and you were to hammer to realize it anyways.

843
00:52:09.871 --> 00:52:14.370
He goes,
it's hard to show my face back in this club again after I got beat up.

844
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.430
Should I just man up and going again next weekend?

845
00:52:17.431 --> 00:52:21.180
Like I own the joint and if I see the two guys,

846
00:52:21.181 --> 00:52:25.140
should I get my group to give them a good ass kicking along with me?

847
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.420
Jesus Christ,
Dude.
Um,

848
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

849
00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:34.750
<v 1>All right.
First of all,
you got,
he didn't psyche lost to one guy.</v>

850
00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.570
He lost the two people,
you know?

851
00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

852
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.020
<v 1>So I don't think that's a,
uh,</v>

853
00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:44.250
I think the embarrassing thing is that you grabbed the woman's ass.

854
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.290
I need to know more details about that.

855
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.730
So let's just say that these two guys would jealous because they wanted to fuck

856
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:53.580
her and you came in.
Um,
Sean was going on.

857
00:52:53.581 --> 00:52:57.690
Somehow they were connected to that woman.
All right,
well,

858
00:52:57.691 --> 00:53:02.460
here's the first lesson.
All right.
If you go on into a bar to meet some lady,

859
00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.330
some strange lady that you don't have a relationship with,
you know,

860
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:11.850
that's,
do use my analogy last week.
That's an away game.
Okay.

861
00:53:11.851 --> 00:53:16.530
Would you go into the bleachers wearing the other team's fucking Jersey by

862
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:19.660
yourself?
You need,
you need,
next time you go in there,

863
00:53:19.661 --> 00:53:22.530
you need to bring some friends.
Um,

864
00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.220
I think you just go in there and you're asking for trouble.
Uh,

865
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.250
one way or the other that you go back in there with some friends,

866
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:33.540
you're going to end up in,
uh,
either jail or the hospital,

867
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.290
one or the other.
That's it.

868
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.470
Either way you're going to end up in court either sewing because you don't have

869
00:53:40.471 --> 00:53:44.130
a fucking,
you know,
you got a droopy eye now or just,

870
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.870
it's just you don't want to do that.
You don't,
all right.
You went in there,

871
00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:52.620
you were drunk.
You know what,
dude,
this is really on you.
This is on you.

872
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.440
Uh,
you will careless with yourself.

873
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:58.710
I'm going to blame you the way they used to blame rape victims back in the day.

874
00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.500
All right?
You weren't dressed like a whore,
but you will.

875
00:54:01.501 --> 00:54:04.530
You were doing the dressing like a whore version for a being a guy.

876
00:54:04.531 --> 00:54:09.390
You walked in,
they're all sloppy.
You rocked into somebody else's bar,

877
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:13.140
you grabbed one of their women,
you started squeezing her ass,

878
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:16.260
like you would test it out some Shaban.
Right?

879
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.700
And then you got beat down.
This should be a life lesson for you.
All right?

880
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:26.430
If you're going to do some Donnie Brasco bar shit,
you gotta,
you gotta have,

881
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:31.730
you gotta have a crew with you and you have to be sober and uh,

882
00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.960
don't grab her ass until you talk her into fucking to you back in her apartment.

883
00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.980
That's when you do the ass grabbing.
Do not go into,

884
00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.960
do not go into a bar.
Especially,
you know,

885
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:48.870
within a day it's a division rivalry.
You know what I mean?

886
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.640
Like as a patriots fan,

887
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:54.750
you would never go down to the metal lands and start grabbing some jets,

888
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:56.790
chicks ass.
That's it.

889
00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:59.310
You're going to get a Hibachi over your fucking head and vice versa.

890
00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:04.470
Vice versa there.
So there you go.
There's your advice,
revenge,

891
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:09.570
uh,
that,
that's not,
that's not you don't want to do,
you don't want to do that.

892
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:12.940
That's it.
It's just going to escalate.

893
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.800
And then what do you think's going to happen?

894
00:55:14.801 --> 00:55:17.350
You're going to go down there and kick their ass and will be like,
all right.

895
00:55:17.351 --> 00:55:19.660
I guess it's even then they get,

896
00:55:19.661 --> 00:55:23.830
then they go out and get a bigger crew and they got to top your ass kicking down

897
00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:27.250
right by then.
You know,
it's like anchorman.

898
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.300
You're in that alley fight right then brick kill somebody.

899
00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:35.620
All right,
next one.
So I,
yes,
sorry,
I wouldn't go back to that.
All right.

900
00:55:35.621 --> 00:55:38.170
Just take the ass kicking.
It's a funny fucking story.

901
00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:41.560
Just telling a colorful way and leave it at that as a fucking idiot.

902
00:55:41.561 --> 00:55:44.020
I walked into somebody else's bar,
hammered by myself.

903
00:55:44.021 --> 00:55:48.340
I start grabbing this girl's ass and next thing you know,
I'm admiring the,
uh,

904
00:55:48.341 --> 00:55:51.940
the woodworking of the floor.
Like,
wow,
look at this as,

905
00:55:51.941 --> 00:55:55.060
is this a brass rail that you,
you know,
footstep?

906
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:57.220
How do they keep it so shiny?

907
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.133
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

908
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.420
<v 1>You know,
as you're laying there on your side,</v>

909
00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:08.070
watching them kicking you in the kidney,
you're looking in the refresh ruler,
the,

910
00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:11.670
uh,
the reflection of that brass rail.
All right,
bill,
we got it.

911
00:56:11.671 --> 00:56:14.010
You're on the floor,
popcorn in your hair.

912
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.170
There's a million ways to tell that story,
sir.
Don't go back down there.

913
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:23.470
You don't want to do that.
All right.
Uh,
hey Billy bin.

914
00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:27.140
Ladin there's another one,
another good one.
Uh,

915
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:31.690
imagine if you started using a puppet to mix things up.
Oh,

916
00:56:31.691 --> 00:56:36.580
for my act.
All right.
You know the same way Dylan went electric.

917
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.260
You could lose a few fans,
but you'd own the mid West and central Florida.

918
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.200
Dude,
you realize how fucking funny this is.

919
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:47.410
This is this written by another comedian.
They have that sort of insight.

920
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:51.400
Do you now?
It's fucking true.
That is
if I stopped doing,

921
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.770
if I kept doing jokes,
but I introduced the puppet,

922
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:57.070
I already know what I would do.
I thought about it a long time ago.

923
00:56:57.071 --> 00:57:01.150
Five or use the puppet.
What I would do is forever.

924
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.490
The puppet is always smarter than the puppeteer.

925
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.920
I would just stand there berating the puppet and I keep telling it to shut the

926
00:57:08.921 --> 00:57:11.740
fuck up.
All right.
You don't say anything.

927
00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:14.650
You don't even fucking think unless I come up the thoughts.

928
00:57:14.651 --> 00:57:17.950
How fucking dare you start giving me shit with your little feet.

929
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.900
Go Fuck Yourself.
That's how I would do it.

930
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.730
As opposed to having a puppet given me shit.
And then I'm rolling my eyes,

931
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.020
you know,
like the husband on a sitcom like,
well,
my wife is smarter than me.

932
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:32.700
I'm just the dumb fat guy.
Right?
Um,

933
00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:37.410
anyways,
he goes,
here's the thing.
You'd probably be hilarious,

934
00:57:37.411 --> 00:57:40.560
despite the ridiculous ridiculousness of it all.

935
00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:44.670
You lose your mind to being up there every night having a conversation with

936
00:57:44.671 --> 00:57:48.270
yourself,
constantly feeding and unhealthy mental state.
Well,

937
00:57:48.271 --> 00:57:51.450
that's kind of what I do on the podcast here,
sir.
Uh,
he goes,

938
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:55.800
I guess I should ask a question.
So what would your puppet look like?

939
00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.500
Would he wear overalls or a suit?

940
00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:03.200
Would he be an animal or would he even be a he?

941
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:07.590
It was a female puppet.
You could give it nuggies every time she was acting up.

942
00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:11.100
Yeah.
See you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
See the direction that you're going.

943
00:58:11.101 --> 00:58:15.990
That's the only way to go.
Now with the puppet,
Terry,
whatever you call it,

944
00:58:15.991 --> 00:58:17.730
being a ventriloquist act,
it's just,

945
00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:23.220
it's just so gone in that direction where the fucking puppet smarter than you,

946
00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:25.830
you know,
you don't,
it's funny,

947
00:58:25.831 --> 00:58:30.831
someone's going to steal this idea or they'll be absolutely brilliant taking an

948
00:58:31.321 --> 00:58:34.110
old genre and turning it on its ear.
You know,
it's funny,
he's funny.

949
00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:37.680
He's probably already done it is,
I just in a roundabout way,

950
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:40.720
just said I had a brilliant idea.
Do you like Dan?
Are you still sitting here?

951
00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:42.000
I get nauseous at this point.

952
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:44.023
<v 0>MMM.</v>

953
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.120
<v 1>No,
that's what I would do.</v>

954
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.670
And then what I would do is I would team up with the dummy and I would start

955
00:58:51.671 --> 00:58:56.140
trashing people in the audience.
You know,

956
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.130
although you know something,

957
00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:58.753
<v 0>uh,</v>

958
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:04.330
<v 1>I dunno.
I am,
I know you're talking about puppets here.</v>

959
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:06.920
I don't know where to go with that.
Um,

960
00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:11.960
what did we go from here?
Flood.
Let's,
let's,
Oh,
I gotta read.

961
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:13.970
I gotta read a little more advertising here.
Everybody,

962
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:19.160
we got to keep the lights on here.
Uh,
where the fuck is it?

963
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.290
Is All the capitals in fucking Europe.
Okay.
We got that one.
You know,

964
00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:25.700
you'd think I would be smart enough,

965
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:28.230
one of these fucking weeks to just have the only thing's open,

966
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:31.280
the things that I need,
but I don't have everything up here.

967
00:59:31.281 --> 00:59:35.900
I'm looking at Ebay and some old Ludwig Bass Drum.
All right,
here we go.

968
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.640
Yeah,
we go happy holidays.
All right.
He voice everybody.

969
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.610
Having your own receptionist would be great,

970
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:46.730
but paying their salary is really expensive.

971
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.420
That's why thousands and thousands of entrepreneurs are now using ie voice to

972
00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:54.300
enhance their image.
Work faster and make more money.
You can try.

973
00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:55.850
He voice right now for free.

974
00:59:55.970 --> 01:00:00.590
When you go to [inaudible] dot com use the use the Promo code bill with he voice

975
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:02.030
as your virtual assistant.

976
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.900
You get your own toll free number and dial by name directory.

977
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:09.470
All your calls will be professionally answered and routed wherever you want.

978
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.910
He voice even types.

979
01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:14.570
All your voicemail messages and emails emails them to you instantly.

980
01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.730

Um,

1035
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:41.040
all right,
let's go back to the letters.

1036
01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.540
Um,
all right.
Pushover a bill.

1037
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.600
I need some standing up for myself.

1038
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.760
I need some help standing up for myself.

1039
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:55.050
I live with my mom as a kid and she used to tell me how bad of a father my dad

1040
01:03:55.051 --> 01:03:58.920
was and I would say I never want it to be like my dad.
As I got older,

1041
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.440
I became every everyone's bitch.

1042
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.580
All they would have to say was,
you're just like your father.

1043
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:09.540
And I would do whatever they told me to do.
It wasn't just my mom and my sister.

1044
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:14.190
A lot of my friends pushed me aside to,
I've since moved out,
I'm 23 now,

1045
01:04:14.191 --> 01:04:17.490
but people still walk all over me and I'm overly nice to everyone.

1046
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.290
How do I stop being everyone's doormat?
Ah,
Jesus,
dude,
you're describing me.

1047
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:26.360
When I was 23,
everybody liked me.
I was nice.
I,

1048
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:30.750
if I met you for fucking two minutes and he asked me to help you move and to use

1049
01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:35.590
my truck,
I'd let Ya,
Ya know?
And then when you went to pay me,
I'd be like,
no,

1050
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.110
no,
no,
no.
Um,
okay.
Uh,
you got to start.

1051
01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.370
You guys got to start doing it.

1052
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:43.223
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1053
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:45.790
<v 1>And this is the thing,
it's a learning curve.</v>

1054
01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:47.283
<v 3>All right.</v>

1055
01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.880
<v 1>Where it's like you can't just be like,</v>

1056
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:51.770
I'm going to start sticking up for myself.

1057
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.910
And then the next time you were in a moment where you're supposed to stick up

1058
01:04:55.911 --> 01:04:56.960
for yourself and you don't,

1059
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:59.810
you can't consider that a failure because you're least be conscious.

1060
01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.430
You're going to be,
he got to go through that.

1061
01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:06.170
Torture is period where you're now watching yourself getting walked all over and

1062
01:05:06.171 --> 01:05:06.621
you go,
well,

1063
01:05:06.621 --> 01:05:09.980
here's that situation again and here I am not sticking up for myself,

1064
01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:15.080
which will cause you in the short run to be even more down on yourself.

1065
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1066
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.100
<v 1>Because before,
when it was,
you were so busy</v>

1067
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.720
<v 0>trying to get the other person to like you,</v>

1068
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.150
you weren't focusing on what a bitch you are being.

1069
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.110
Now you're actually going to watch it all right?

1070
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:29.260
But know that that's part of the,
uh,
road to success.

1071
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.600
Anytime you try to break a bad habit,

1072
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.080
you know you're trying to quit drinking or you're trying to stop eating late

1073
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.310
night and here you are eating again.

1074
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.850
You're beating yourself up as you fucking doing it.
That's the first steps,

1075
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.810
because before you didn't,
you'd just be shotgun,
shotgun and beers,
right?

1076
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.580
Eating ice cream and not even questioning it.
So with this shit,
um,

1077
01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:54.870
<v 1>what can really help you out is if you write it down
bright down,
like,</v>

1078
01:05:54.871 --> 01:05:58.590
listen,
I'm tired of people telling me that.
I'm just like my dad.

1079
01:05:59.190 --> 01:06:00.023
Um,

1080
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:02.533
<v 0>you know,</v>

1081
01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.480
<v 1>and you know,
you could start with that.
Don't tolerate that anymore.</v>

1082
01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.550
Just say to your mother,

1083
01:06:08.551 --> 01:06:12.450
I want you to stop saying that to me because all you've done is telling me how

1084
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:16.230
bad of a father my dad is.
And so whenever you tell me that,

1085
01:06:16.231 --> 01:06:21.000
that's like you're saying that I'm a piece of shit.
All Right,
I'm 23.

1086
01:06:21.001 --> 01:06:23.760
Now it's time for me to become my own man.

1087
01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:26.820
I don't like when you tell me that it hurts me as a person.

1088
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.490
It hurts my development.
All right.

1089
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.790
Now how can your mother say no to that?
You know,

1090
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.010
easily she could be a fucking pain in the ass,
but I dunno.
Um,
but just,

1091
01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.010
just start writing down like,
you know,
I don't know.

1092
01:06:41.011 --> 01:06:44.730
It's like doing like starting out comedy.
You don't fucking go up on stage,

1093
01:06:44.731 --> 01:06:47.910
try to do an hour and kill you.
Just try to hang in there for five minutes.

1094
01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:52.860
She just just take baby steps.
And uh,
my biggest thing,

1095
01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:54.090
the reason why I wouldn't,

1096
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.720
I avoided confrontation is because the only way confrontation when I grew up was

1097
01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:05.120
screaming fuck you.
And getting into a fist fight.

1098
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:09.000
So,
you know,
when I would be down at whatever,

1099
01:07:09.001 --> 01:07:13.290
bringing my truck in to get it fixed and it felt like I was getting fucked over,

1100
01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:17.310
I would be in my head literally going like,
well,
I don't want to fight this guy.

1101
01:07:17.311 --> 01:07:19.980
You know,
even if I win,
I'm going to have grease all over my face.

1102
01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.090
If he gets a couple of shots,
then you know,

1103
01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.050
it's probably going to grab a wrench.

1104
01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:32.080
Like I'm literally thinking that when all I'm doing is getting a tune up and I

1105
01:07:32.751 --> 01:07:34.420
feel like,
you know,
or you know,

1106
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:38.650
I remember one time the guy put a new engine in my truck,
my,
I remember,
uh,

1107
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.753
it just died.

1108
01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:45.140
The thing died and I wanted to make it as a comic and the last thing I needed

1109
01:07:45.141 --> 01:07:46.010
was a car payment.

1110
01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:49.310
So it's like I would either go out back then you could get a piece of shit for

1111
01:07:49.311 --> 01:07:53.750
11 grand.
I'd either have to be 11 grand in debt or like,
you know,

1112
01:07:53.751 --> 01:07:58.040
get a new engine put in was like,
you know,
12,
1500 bucks sells like,
yeah,

1113
01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:01.190
why don't we knock a zero off of that?
So that's what I did.

1114
01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:06.020
And I paid the guy and the fucking cunt charge me for the antifreeze that he put

1115
01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:08.840
in the engine.
He just would charge me for everything.
I learned a lot.
Never,

1116
01:08:08.841 --> 01:08:12.740
never,
uh,
never trusted mechanic that has a manicure and that's not a joke.

1117
01:08:12.741 --> 01:08:13.574
He had Cologne,

1118
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:18.170
his fucking nails where we're like pimp level shiny.

1119
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:23.330
So,
um,
but I didn't say anything to him cause I'm like,
oh,
this guy's like,

1120
01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:26.060
you know,
he's like 60,
I don't want,
I'm not going to punch a 60 year old guy.

1121
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.670
And they like,
and I would be thinking this shit,

1122
01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:33.671
but I wasn't even conscious because it just been in my head since I could

1123
01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:37.220
remember.
So it's playing on a loop and a lot of shit.

1124
01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:39.860
If you finally say it out loud or you write it down,

1125
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:44.690
you realize how wrong it is or how absurd it is.

1126
01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.500
And it can,
it can kind of kickstart you,
uh,

1127
01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.340
start going down the right road.
So that,

1128
01:08:51.341 --> 01:08:55.790
that's what I would do when you have to be very forgiving of yourself.
Like,

1129
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:59.030
you know what's funny is you're a total pushover probably until it comes to

1130
01:08:59.031 --> 01:08:59.900
looking at yourself,

1131
01:08:59.901 --> 01:09:02.840
then you probably like a fucking drill sergeant and you're always beating

1132
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:07.000
yourself up.
So I would say,
you know,
try to find the humor in,

1133
01:09:07.001 --> 01:09:11.900
in breaking a bad habit or trying to change yourself and uh,
you know,

1134
01:09:11.901 --> 01:09:15.890
you work at it every day.
You know,
it's like playing an instrument.
You know,

1135
01:09:15.891 --> 01:09:17.810
if you play once every three months,
you never going to get better.

1136
01:09:17.811 --> 01:09:21.320
But if you fucking play an hour every day,
all of a sudden,
right?

1137
01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:24.950
You start shredding and here come the girls and that jumping on your Dick,

1138
01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:28.670
all right?
And you start sticking up for yourself.
You start,
they let the women,

1139
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.230
they,
they,
they,
they're attracted to that.
I'm not talking about being a Dick,

1140
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:37.850
but women are attracted to fucking like guys who,

1141
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.180
they don't want to marry some pussy,
right?

1142
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:47.590
All of them want you to go out there and fucking grab it by the throat and drag

1143
01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:51.470
it home,
throw it in the pot so they can fucking cook it up.

1144
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:53.000
Metaphorically speaking.

1145
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.390
Last thing I ever want to do is suggest that a woman would want to go into a

1146
01:09:56.391 --> 01:10:01.310
kitchen and actually be fucking nice for one
sandwich.

1147
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.220
Um,
sorry.
Uh,
you know what I'm saying?

1148
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:11.600
All right.
I hope that helped you out.
Um,
did I get everything?

1149
01:10:11.601 --> 01:10:15.590
I get to everything here.
Oh,
cop that shot dog bill,

1150
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:19.040
what's your take on the Hawthorne Police officer firing off one and two?

1151
01:10:19.041 --> 01:10:23.300
A dog fucking bullshit.
Right?
Well,
I mean obviously I'm not pro shooting dogs,

1152
01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:27.860
but I wasn't there.
I don't know what happened.
Look,

1153
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:31.610
if you're a cop and you're walking in there and some giant dog comes at you with

1154
01:10:31.611 --> 01:10:35.270
his teeth showing and is gonna fucking mall your face off,

1155
01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:40.610
you know,
I mean,
what are you supposed to do?
But if,
if that shit that,
I mean,

1156
01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:43.210
I've seen youtube videos where like the dog isn't doing,

1157
01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:46.370
it's just barking like bro,
bro,
Bro.
Cause you're in the house,

1158
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.010
but it's not charging.
It's not doing anything.

1159
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:51.680
And they have it standard procedure,

1160
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:55.260
eliminate the threat and they just fucking shoot the dog.
That does brutal.

1161
01:10:55.430 --> 01:11:00.430
It's a brutal one on youtube where they went into the wrong fucking house and

1162
01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:03.860
they got the guy in the floor and then they shoot his dog and they realize

1163
01:11:03.861 --> 01:11:07.340
they're in the wrong house and they killed both his dogs.
It's brutal.

1164
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.660
It's brutal.
But um,
in defense of the cops,

1165
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:15.180
those are the ones that people put up on Youtube.
You know,

1166
01:11:15.181 --> 01:11:19.200
I imagine that they could then show you a thousand of cops going in,

1167
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:23.280
getting attacked by once great dogs that their piece of shit,

1168
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.890
scumbag owner turn into a maniac.

1169
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:30.390
So maybe there's some sort of sweeping thing that if the dog weighs more than

1170
01:11:30.391 --> 01:11:34.880
fucking,
if you feel threatened by the dog.
Um,

1171
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:36.300
<v 0>okay,</v>

1172
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.520
<v 1>I'm a,
I'm just playing devil's advocate here.
You're a cop,</v>

1173
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:40.330
you're going into a rest.
Somebody,
they,
you're,

1174
01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.970
you're trying to deal with does is this person gonna pull a weapon out and blow

1175
01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:47.310
my fucking brains out.
I'm never going to see my kid again.

1176
01:11:47.311 --> 01:11:51.780
And meanwhile you got does dog.
You know what I mean?

1177
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.210
It's like you can only look at one thing at one time.

1178
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.750
So in your life is in fucking danger.
I think a lot of people,

1179
01:11:57.751 --> 01:12:01.620
including animal lovers,
uh,
we're thrusted,
it's for,

1180
01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:06.390
I think it's very easy to not be a cop and just sit there and be like,
dude,

1181
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:08.400
you know what,
I would've done the same way you do.
Like,

1182
01:12:08.401 --> 01:12:10.830
you know when you trash the quarterback of your team,

1183
01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:13.110
you know what I would've done with my nonathletic ass.

1184
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.210
This is what I would've done.
I would've left the leftover,

1185
01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:18.150
the fucking defensive line,
you know,

1186
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.480
and then called an option or whatever the fuck you would have done.
So yeah,

1187
01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:24.000
I may just hearing that story.
Uh,

1188
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:28.860
absolutely devastating.
Cause I know if the cops ever came in my house,

1189
01:12:28.861 --> 01:12:32.640
my dog would be flipping out and trying to attack them and I would be like,

1190
01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:35.670
let me just put her in the other room.
But if they,
whatever,

1191
01:12:35.671 --> 01:12:37.680
we're coming in there and I was considered a threat,

1192
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.830
they have to take me down and then my dog would come at them and then they would

1193
01:12:40.831 --> 01:12:45.700
fucking shoot my dog.
Um,
and it would suck.

1194
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:47.050
So I'm obviously,

1195
01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.180
I wish there was a some way that they wouldn't have to do that.

1196
01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.880
Uh,
but as much as people want 100% blame cops there,

1197
01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:58.690
uh,

1198
01:12:58.690 --> 01:13:03.690
the real culprit that's set that whole thing off our fucking assholes who turned

1199
01:13:03.911 --> 01:13:07.810
that dogs in the maniacs and maybe even someone like myself who doesn't,

1200
01:13:07.811 --> 01:13:10.120
I mean I don't know how to have my dog under control,

1201
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.510
so I just put her in the back room cause I dunno cause some fucking asshole

1202
01:13:13.511 --> 01:13:18.040
fucked her up.
You know that Jesus Christ I got work to do.

1203
01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.890
Um,
so there you go.
That is the,
uh,
you know what?

1204
01:13:21.891 --> 01:13:25.300
I didn't even get to that fucking,
you see that report or that died.

1205
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:29.250
Let me get to where the hell is that story here.

1206
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.730
This writer for rolling stone,

1207
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.010
which I have a subscription to one of the magazines,

1208
01:13:37.011 --> 01:13:41.630
few magazines that I actually read every episode,
every installment.

1209
01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:46.820
Um,
Michael Hastings,
uh,

1210
01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:52.310
he had a horrible death.
He fucking was going down,
I believe it was Highland,

1211
01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:56.960
just south of Melrose is Mercedes was traveling at ridiculous speeds.

1212
01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:02.020
He hit a fucking tree and the whole thing exploded bursting into flame and they

1213
01:14:02.361 --> 01:14:06.980
had to identify him by his dental records and uh,
allegedly this guy knew.

1214
01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:08.690
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1215
01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:12.310
<v 1>I guess he wrote some fucking article in rolling stone where he was over in</v>

1216
01:14:12.311 --> 01:14:16.690
Afghanistan talking to some higher ups in the military and they were saying some

1217
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:21.040
shit that they thought was off the record and he put it all in the article and

1218
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:22.210
there's people,

1219
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:27.220
conspiracy theorists trying to say that his car was cyber attacked.

1220
01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:31.830
Now I'm not even going to get into that,
but dude,

1221
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.320
how fucked up is the world getting if like,

1222
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.920
that's actually something that somebody could do.

1223
01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:43.180
I'm not saying whether it was done by this guy or not.
I have no fucking idea.

1224
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:47.470
He might've been hammered.
I have no idea.
I have no fucking clue.

1225
01:14:47.471 --> 01:14:50.500
I don't know anything about it,
but I'm just saying that the fact

1226
01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:57.210
that somebody could hack into your computer and cause your car to speed up.

1227
01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1228
01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:01.800
<v 1>And there's nothing you can,
you can't shut the car off.</v>

1229
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1230
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:04.940
<v 1>This is why I don't know that,</v>

1231
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:08.920
I don't believe that it's just like his evil is that is we got to eliminate this

1232
01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:13.150
guy.
Isn't there a zillion other ways to kill them without doing that?

1233
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.940
Like what if he slammed into like a fucking minivan with the,

1234
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:23.710
you know,
a married couple in their three,
four kids,
you know,

1235
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.540
it's gotta be,
you know,
can't they just spray some Miss Donna?

1236
01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:28.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1237
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:31.270
<v 1>You know,
just walk up to them in a mall like,
Hi sir,</v>

1238
01:15:31.271 --> 01:15:32.650
would you like to try this fragrance?

1239
01:15:32.651 --> 01:15:36.460
You just spray it on him and then the guy like,
you know,

1240
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:40.360
10 minutes later and he's trying on some slacks,
he just keels over.

1241
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:43.900
You can't just do it that way.
But anyways,
is this true?

1242
01:15:43.901 --> 01:15:47.170
Is can they actually do that shit?
And this makes me feel glad that you know,

1243
01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:51.640
half my time out here,
I drive around in a classic car.
You know,

1244
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.960
not like I'm any sort of a threat.
But what I'm saying is if that,

1245
01:15:55.961 --> 01:16:00.220
if I just would think if you had the ability to do that,

1246
01:16:00.221 --> 01:16:05.200
some fucking nerds would just do it just to do it.
Cause it would be funny,

1247
01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:08.440
just speed you up for a second and slow you down just to freak you out.

1248
01:16:09.710 --> 01:16:09.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1249
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:14.700
<v 1>You know like do you remember back in the day when this is like pre Internet</v>

1250
01:16:14.701 --> 01:16:18.690
fun?
What you would do is you'd take your garage door opener,

1251
01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.100
right?

1252
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:24.030
And you would drive around the neighborhood and he'd pointed at every garage

1253
01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:26.550
until you found somebody that had the same one as you.

1254
01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:30.660
And back in the day they just had like,
it wasn't sophisticated.

1255
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.860
So not only yours open,
not only yours,
it opened the other ones too.

1256
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.440
So you'd,

1257
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:43.460
you'd eventually find somebody that had the same garage door brand is you and

1258
01:16:44.011 --> 01:16:45.660
you could open and close the garage.

1259
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:50.010
So at least you could my fucking neighborhood.
So you just find,

1260
01:16:50.011 --> 01:16:54.870
you use drive one person nuts,
you'd just drive by and you just fucking,

1261
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:58.350
every once in a while we just open it and I don't know why we would do it.

1262
01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:03.210
We were assholes but so using that,
if you could fucking do that.

1263
01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.693
Um,

1264
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.190

1266
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.360
hack in to steal like credit card numbers and shit.
I mean,

1267
01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:18.080
wouldn't that be somebody just doing that just to do it like your board?

1268
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:23.570
It was just the,
was this the dumbest part of the podcast?

1269
01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:28.571
Everybody did I stick the landing starting off with ignorance and then a why?

1270
01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:32.360
Why wasn't gay?
Well we'll fuck you know what the reality,

1271
01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:34.280
if I ever book a commercial,
I'm going to be,

1272
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:37.640
you know the commercial where the adults sits there with all the kids and they

1273
01:17:37.641 --> 01:17:38.570
go,
you know,
what would you,

1274
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.050
what would you do if you had a zillion dollars and then the kids that I can buy

1275
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:44.930
an inmate at a candy.
Yeah,

1276
01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:49.340
we could have hot fudge waterfalls and shit.
I would be sitting there right with,

1277
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:52.850
except it wouldn't be like the basketball one where they were like making fun of

1278
01:17:52.851 --> 01:17:57.140
the fact.
Like I would be like,
you know what I'm saying?
I'm saying I'm a moron.

1279
01:17:57.141 --> 01:17:59.600
Everybody.
