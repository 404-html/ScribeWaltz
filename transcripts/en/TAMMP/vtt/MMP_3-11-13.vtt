00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.270
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

5
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:14.930
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.860
March 11th,
2013.
How you doing?

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.030
How's your life working out for you this week?
I,
um,

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.080
I had a fall.
Jesus,
you know what?
I can't even tell you what happened.

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.310
I can't tell it.
I have to sing it to you.
It's got to come from my heart.

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.250
Oh.
If you're a lucky man,
good things happen to you.

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.990
But if you're a red cunt,
this is full of fucking zoo.

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.310
You'll be out on the road and find out your roof collapsed and there won't be a

13
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:50.690
thing you can do about it.
That make any sense.

14
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:52.880
I don't care if it did.
You know,
most of the,

15
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:57.800
some of the biggest hits never made any sense.
Right?
Oh,
sugar,
boop,
boop,

16
00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:02.150
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.
You are ma can d girl.

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.703
Um,

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.660
so I was touring the Midwest barnstorming as they say,

19
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.210
driving and some no name dodge SUV.
You know,
that's what you get when you say,

20
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:19.040
hey,
I want to rent a car from Madison,
Wisconsin to Detroit,

21
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.860
Michigan,
and I don't want to bring it back.
Do you have a car for me?

22
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.520
And they say,
Oh,
why?
You know what?
I think we got one here in the back.

23
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.620
I didn't even know dodge made an SUV.
You know,

24
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.670
dodge is like the Oldsmobile of Chrysler.
Um,

25
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.580
automobiles are nice.
I like,
I,
you know,

26
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:41.270
I miss all those cars that were going to be Oldsmobile,
man.

27
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:44.930
When people had a mercury,
what else did they discontinue?

28
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:48.990
Pontiac's what has happened to this country?
What have you bet did Dan,

29
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.390
do you get a Chevy or Cadillac that's fucking it.
Ford or a Lincoln?

30
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.470
Go Fuck Yourself.
You know,
you either have it or you don't.
Once again,

31
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.350
another side of the middle class shrinking.
Um,

32
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.570
oh by the way,
you know,
I just found out,
you know,

33
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:08.420
cause I don't pay attention to politics anymore because I just feel like,

34
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:09.254
all right,
you know,

35
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.440
they're there eventually just they're gonna run it into the ground.

36
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:14.880
We're gonna have to build it back up again.
That's,

37
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:17.090
that's basically what's going to happen.
I guess.

38
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:20.390
Sola all a fucking liberal face there.
He signed that thing,

39
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.420
new years eve basically passing off it.

40
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:27.500
Now they can just arrest you and detain you without a trial forever.
That's good.

41
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.330
There you go.
See that right there people.
Everyone.

42
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.620
You all made fun of me cause I don't vote for the fucking number one horse and

43
00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.940
number two horse.
That's why,
cause there's no difference.

44
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:42.170
It's the same fucking horse.
Oh,
shut up bill.
All right,
so this is what happened.

45
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.410
So I'm fucking driving this,
no name,
DOJ driving this dodge SUV.

46
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.960
I'm in Madison,
Wisconsin and um,

47
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.150
baret do all these awesome shows.
I love going to towns like that.
By the way,

48
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.130
I can tell you this unbelievably is cities that uh,

49
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.820
Frank Sinatra did not sing about,

50
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.600
you know,
or Tony Bennet,
any,
any crooner.

51
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.050
If a crooner has sung about a city,

52
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.600
then you can tell right away that,
you know,

53
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.930
before you even land on the ground is going to be ridiculous traffic and

54
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:23.600
everything's going to cost twice as much.
You know,
Ma,

55
00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:28.601
I kind of town Chicago is $80 for a hamburger.

56
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:34.591
Chicago is that fucking loop where no traffic fucking move,

57
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.740
right?
I left my hat and San Francisco,

58
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.960
that new fucking wall and then New York,
you know what that is,
right?

59
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.950
Bunch of fucking losers was stenciled goatees and sweatpants thinking they're

60
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:53.230
fucking,
they're,
they're making it.

61
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.210
If I can wake up in a city,
right,
and it's sitting there shirtless,

62
00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.060
riding in a fuck,

63
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:03.250
and you go that they cut the roof off of putting their hands in the air as they

64
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.820
drive through fucking times square,
making a video for their rockabilly album.

65
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.600
You know,
all of those places.
I'm not saying he shouldn't go there.

66
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.980
You should definitely go there.
Right?

67
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.610
And bring your easel and do a little sketch or whatever the fuck it is you're

68
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:19.450
supposed to do.
But I'm telling you,
don't sleep on Madison,
Wisconsin.

69
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.160
Don't you dare look down on Milwaukee,
Wisconsin,
and I'll tell you right now,

70
00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:28.300
I've got another one for you.
This is the uppercut grand rapids,
Michigan.
Yeah.

71
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.480
Where are you guys going on vacation?
You're going to Puerto Rico.

72
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.240
You going to Aco Poco?
No,
we're going to grand rapids,

73
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.840
Michigan and we're going to get some fucking,
I'm going to go get a waffle,

74
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.180
which at the a,
the real food cafe.

75
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.300
I ate like a fucking suicidal plumber this week.

76
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.040
At least the breakfast I had a waffle,
which when I was in grand rapids,
Michigan.

77
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.890
Oh,
Royal Oak Michigan.
I also forgot about that and I'll tell you,

78
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.860
downtown Detroit slowly coming back the outskirts is still pretty scary,

79
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.960
but I got to tell you,
you know they have pockets.

80
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.240
You know there's a gleam gentlemen.
There is a gleam,

81
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.920
worst fucking pre play off.

82
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.270
I think I talked about that speech ever.
Marty Schottenheimer,

83
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.900
he's trying to get his team amped up to win a playoff game.

84
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:24.010
That standing on that fucking football,
whether we can see your breath,
you know,

85
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.080
and as they're looking at his breath,
in his breath it says there's a gentlemen,

86
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.910
a gleam gleam has never been spoken in football ever.
You know,

87
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.850
if you,
in fact,
if you have a gleam,
I think at this point,

88
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.100
that's one of the reasons why you get cut from a football team.

89
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.200
Why didn't you get once you get rid of him?

90
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.510
I thought he was doing all right on us.
Special teams.
Ah,

91
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:50.350
there was a gleam and it was a gleam gentlemen and I didn't like it.

92
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.180
I didn't see that killer instinct.
He was too gleamy
yes.

93
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:58.250
This podcast isn't going to make any sense cause fucking brain is all over the

94
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:02.480
place cause I have a hole in the roof of my house.
I will get to that.
Okay.

95
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.160
I will get to that and you will sit and you will wait.
Cancer.
So anyways,

96
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.020
I'm in Madison,
Wisconsin,
you know,
and uh,

97
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.020
I was working with Nate Craig and he's from that neck of the woods,

98
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.220
actually grew up right near there.
So he was taking me around town,

99
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:20.750
went to all these great places to eat.

100
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:22.850
Went to the some legendary breakfast place,

101
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.690
one of those greasy spoons that somebody who's running for president stops in
at,

102
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.970
you know,
has two bites of eggs,

103
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.650
does a thumbs up with some fucking immigrant wearing an apron and then he
leaves.

104
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.221
Well,

105
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.760
I actually stayed there and I ate the whole breakfast and I'm not running for

106
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:40.490
anything,
you know?
Um,

107
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.980
Oh God,
I'm so fat right now.

108
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.960
<v 1>You can't believe how smooth my stomach is.</v>

110
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.030
My stomach right now is so fucking smooth.

111
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.300
You wouldn't even believe that I could sit up in bed because you would say that

112
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.110
poor bastard was born without abdomens abs,

113
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.220
abdominals.
There's the fucking word.
So anyways,
um,

114
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.500
we do the GIG.

115
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

116
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.210
<v 1>We do the Gig.
Uh,</v>

117
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.940
<v 0>okay.</v>

118
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.420
<v 1>What the fuck was it?
I don't even know anymore.
Was it Thursday?
Thursday,
Friday,</v>

119
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.180
Saturday.
No.
Wednesday we do the Gig.
Wayne State.

120
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.490
We have a great fucking time after the Gig.

121
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:24.470
This guy from the weary traveler in rest slash restaurant tells us to come by.

122
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.500
We go over there.
I look on the menu.
What do they have on the menu?

123
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:29.330
They have Hungarian Goulash.

124
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.840
When was the last time you ever saw a Hungarian fucking Goulash or the rated g

125
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:40.310
version?
Hungarian Goulash on a,
on a menu.
Huh?
Well,

126
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:43.520
if you do then you live with one of these fucking towns that frank never sung

127
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.490
about.
And I was like,
my mother used to make Hungarian Goulash.
I got it.

128
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.343
I got to try it.

129
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

130
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.650
<v 1>Um,
then I guess when my mother made it,
when my mother,
when she made it,</v>

131
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:56.810
she put noodles in it.
But this was the,
I guess that,

132
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:01.260
that the noodles came in in Ellis island.
Well,
did you have a dental?

133
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:05.090
He meant the Hungarians were near the Italians and they were like,
oh,

134
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:06.950
what she got in the pot there?

135
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.030
You know what you need step is I want you to put some fucking noodles in there

136
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:14.650
right there.
All right,
there is it?
Danoe.

137
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.870
So anyways,
I had this,
this Cup of,
uh,
if you're in Madison,
Wisconsin,

138
00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.360
go,
I'm going to type all these fucking restaurants,

139
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.890
go to the weary traveler in and try a cup or get yourself a bowl of the

140
00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:32.640
Hungarian Goulash is fine.
It's fucking tremendous.
It's got a nice kick to it.

141
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.840
You know,
I visited it a couple of old friends,
you know,

142
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:42.150
with ice on him and I had a great time and uh,
you know,

143
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.270
great mix of people there.
We talked conspiracy theory,

144
00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:49.260
we talked about Wes Welker getting traded,
you know,

145
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.670
we had an awesome fucking time,
so everything's going great.
You know,

146
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.420
I'm breathing in the winter air looking at the dirty snow.

147
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.900
I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling like nothing can touch me.

148
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.990
My life is going to be phenomenal.
All right.

149
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.270
Now the next thing that happened on this trip is so fucking traumatic.

150
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.490
I don't really remember when it started.

151
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.720
I believe I was coming out of that greasy diner that I'm sure Joe Biden is eaten

152
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:20.130
and um,
and with the pancakes are delicious.

153
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:21.210
Ha ha ha.

154
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.500
Click picture taken these out forces himself to puke

155
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.540
in the,
in the,
uh,
taxpayers busted.
He's driving around in,
um,

156
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.590
anyways,
the lovely Nia calls me up and she's an absolute tears.

157
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.260
All right.
We had just done,
redone her office.
We did the floors.

158
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.140
I swear to God,
dude,
it looked like a fucking basketball court in there.

159
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.140
A very small basketball court,
you know,

160
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.920
if you will like a fucking a squirrel,

161
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.340
it would look like a full court basketball court.
T all right,
but whatever.

162
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.060
I'm just saying it was fucking beautiful.
We did the walls,

163
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.560
they even painted the ceiling.

164
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.940
It was the one room in my old ass fucking house that was immaculate.

165
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.640
All right.
I just got the roof done.

166
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.420
Listeners of the podcast realize I just got the roof done.
So I'm psyched.

167
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.210
Cake is two things you don't want in your fucking house.

168
00:10:16.211 --> 00:10:20.620
You don't want fire and you don't want water.
Nothing does damage like that.

169
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.680
It's just,
it's fucking over.

170
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.703
<v 0>So</v>

171
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.340
<v 1>she calls me up crying and says the fucking ceiling collapsed in the office and</v>

172
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:36.150
there's water pouring in
and um,

173
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.960
and I am in the middle of fucking nowhere.
Wisconsin.

174
00:10:40.961 --> 00:10:45.430
I was in between somewhere between Madison and Milwaukee and I get this picture

175
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.170
and I get this phone call

176
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.523
<v 0>and</v>

177
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.880
<v 1>how memetically frantic and I was like,</v>

178
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:59.130
has the water stopped cause it can of rain that night.
And I'm like,

179
00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:01.500
is the water stopped?
And I'm thinking,
we just put a new roof on it.

180
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.180
Did they fuck up the roof?
What the fuck happened?

181
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:07.260
A zillion things that going through my head.
How long was the water pouring in?

182
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.190
Because it happened when she was sleeping and then she goes,
no,
it stopped.

183
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.480
And then she went back and she goes,
no,
it started again.
And I was like fuck.

184
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.010
And you know,
she was talking about her pictures and shit.
And I'm like,
no,

185
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:23.020
the floors,
the fucking rest of the house get a,

186
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.610
I wish I'd thought to tell her to push the fucking couch.

187
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.910
We've got this stupid Ikea couch,
you know,
and you're not thinking,

188
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:32.850
he's just trying to get the furniture out away.
Fucking fuck the couch.

189
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.100
Let the couch be a giant fucking sponge.
Um,
well,
whatever.

190
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:39.670
I was in the middle of nowhere.
And uh,

191
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.670
what ended up happening was it wasn't the roof.

192
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.940
I have a crawl space between my ceiling and the roof.
And there was some,

193
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.280
you know,
my house is like 90 years old.

194
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:51.600
So there was some sort of part of the drainage things.

195
00:11:51.601 --> 00:11:52.860
One of the joints failed.

196
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.890
It backed up on the side of the house and the water came up and then one of the

197
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:59.290
joints failed and then it just started to pool.

198
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.860
It's sunk down to the wood and then,
you know,

199
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.280
made the plaster wet and then it collapsed.
And um,

200
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.060
she didn't hear it collapsed because it kind of hit the couch was also fucking

201
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:12.760
soaking wet and uh,

202
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.630
the damage was done and it went all the way down to the bottom of my fucking

203
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:20.860
house.
And my house looks like a disaster right now.

204
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:22.893
Uh,

205
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.820
but I got to say the insurance company did step up once they realized that it

206
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.310
wasn't a his fault and that it was a plumbing issue or whatever,
the,

207
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.710
I don't know what the fuck they said.
Um,

208
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.660
they have stepped up and they came over here to fucking help the lovely Neil

209
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:43.960
clean up.
They put some fans on it,
but by then the fucking damage was done.

210
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:46.330
So I don't know what's going to happen.

211
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.500
I'm absolutely sick right now because they're trying to tell me that the floor

212
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:53.110
buckled.
Um,

213
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.800
and I immediately pictured all the floorboards,

214
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.900
just every one of them just fucking looking like hammer toes.

215
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:02.170
But I think they're trying to say it's in the middle of the room.

216
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.770
I don't know what,
but that would is priceless.
You know,

217
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:08.650
that's the wood that they from trees,
they cut down on the 20s that were,

218
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.070
you know,
old trees when wood was solid men,

219
00:13:12.071 --> 00:13:16.870
what men and women didn't have a voice.
Now you've got that Home Depot Shit,

220
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.550
you know,
I should make he's cheese,
yo kind of wood.
Right?

221
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.490
So that's my big fear is that they're going to take out that wood and replace it

222
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:31.690
with the other shit.
So I've already put the Kibosh on that.
And I'm like,
listen,

223
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.280
uh,
insurance people,
that's the kind of wood that was there.

224
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:37.840
And that's the kind of wood this can be put down.

225
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:39.820
If I have to fucking scour the earth to find it.

226
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.940
Five to go to Detroit and go into one of those abandoned fucking crack house.

227
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:46.810
Beautiful hundred year old fucking houses.
And take the wood out myself.

228
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.740
I am a,
I don't want to get into it.
It's fucking horrible.

229
00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:52.990
My brother's coming out to visit,
you know,

230
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.860
he's visited me like 20 times in my career.
In the first fucking 16,

231
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:58.120
I was sleeping on a futon.

232
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.300
The last three times I had a bed in a one bedroom apartment.

233
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.310
I finally have a fucking house,
right finally feeling like its success.

234
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:10.320
He's going to come and the fucking
fucking,

235
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.610
I was choking this week on stage that the hole in the ceiling,
it looked like.

236
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.720
Just imagine if for grizzly bears,
like parachute didn't open.

237
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.970
That was the size of the fucking hole.

238
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.110
And I don't know why.
Think grizzly bear,

239
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:30.250
I just remember seeing one fall out of a tree one time when they shot it with

240
00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:34.180
something,
you know,
a tranquilizer gun and uh,
just Kinda came down.

241
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:37.270
It was like a big ball of fur.
That's what it looks like.
Maybe a,

242
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.470
maybe a black bear,
I'd say.
I don't know people,
you know,

243
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.700
the all time I bought this fucking house the entire time I've been fixed in this

244
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:49.870
fucking thing and it's all been shit.
You can't see plumbing,

245
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.920
electrical.
I don't even know what else to fucking roof.
Just Shit.

246
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:59.150
You can't see.
And I was finally getting to the fun part.
Shit,

247
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:01.040
you can see the floors,
right?
Should,

248
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:05.780
you can show off to people when they come over,
finally get a rum done.

249
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.110
And Mother Nature is like,
ah,
look at,
Oh Philly boy.

250
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.940
He thinks he's got a nice house there.
Let's,
let's,

251
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.000
let's do this man a fucking hole in your ceiling.
Do you like that?

252
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.340
You like dead?
Oh,
you want some more?

253
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.860
You want some more as a little fucking glass of water.

254
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.030
Deal with that all the way down to your basement.
All right,
day.

255
00:15:25.031 --> 00:15:29.030
You're freckled cont how do you like that?
So

256
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.540
I've been absolutely,
uh,
I dunno,
you know,
just some,

257
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.120
it's,
you know,
what's a typical story?
Cyclical story,

258
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.350
man tries to do something.
It takes two steps forward,

259
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.390
gets kicked in the balls and falls,
three steps backwards.
Typical,
typical story.

260
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:49.880
And evidently there's going to be some comedy in this at some point,

261
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:53.540
but I realize it's tragedy plus time and I'm still in the middle of the fucking

262
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:57.290
tragedy.
Oh,
you know what else is great?
Cause the walls is so old.
This is in him,

263
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.240
you know,
like 1%.
So now the people who are going to take the plastic announced,

264
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.150
they are like little Wayne atray to do that.
We don't have the proper filter.

265
00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:07.040
The anchor says that the level bumps and now they're out,
right?

266
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.010
They're looking at the shit downstairs.
They go,
oh we got to test for lead paint.

267
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.380
It's like it was made the twenties you know,
it has lead paint,

268
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:17.410
probably has 14 coats of it under fucking 36 that we'll paint it on top of that.

269
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:23.180
So,
uh,
God,
I,
I just,
you know,

270
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.100
I swear to God,
I swear to God first.
I hate to say this,

271
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.810
the first time ever I was in my garage today and I just,

272
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.780
and I actually quietly said to myself,
I hate this house.

273
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.360
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
Do you guys say that about your kids?

274
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.250
Does that ever happen?

275
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:49.310
Every time you try to make your kid a better fucking citizen and every time you

276
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:53.480
think you fucking turned around the stupid fuck comes home,
you know,

277
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.260
got into a fight at school and got caught with a 12 pack or that they just like,

278
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.830
I just wish I never had that one just stopped at the other one.

279
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.080
I'll maybe skip this one.
I Dunno.
Anyways,

280
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:10.790
this is the Monday morning podcast everybody and uh,
but you know something,

281
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.940
I am,
ah,
fuck it out.
I'll say something positive as secondly.

282
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.450
Let's get into the advertising.

283
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.670
I've got to hype something for a good buddy of my Wilsall Vince who was nice

284
00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:22.950
enough,
um,
to be part of the,
um,

285
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.190
the group of comics that helped to honor Patrice O'neil at the benefit we had.

286
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.250
And a will was one of Patrice has great friends and a roommate of his,

287
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.080
um,
God,
they lived together at least five,
six years.
So anyways,

288
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:42.500
we'll made some tee shirts.
We sold most of them I have to benefit.

289
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:43.760
He still has some left.

290
00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.910
And I know a lot of people wanted to be a part of the benefit and he wants to

291
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:50.640
warn him to help out.
Uh,
Patrice has family.
Um,

so there you go.
Well,
here's,

321
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.310
here's the positive thing that I take out of,
um,

322
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.900
out of what happened to me.
Oh,
here's one thing that you,
you know,
you know,

323
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.510
when your life is messed up,

324
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.180
something bad is happening to you is people bring up the fact that you're,

325
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.350
you're still have your health.

326
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.860
That's usually a good sign that something horrific happened to you.

327
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:11.490
But I'm actually seeing that story about that guy fucking dying in that sink

328
00:20:11.631 --> 00:20:16.000
hole was one of the creepiest things I've ever seen in my life.
And I was like,

329
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:16.780
okay,
all right,

330
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.460
I'm sitting here crying about some wet floors and walls was a swallowed up by

331
00:20:21.461 --> 00:20:26.050
the earth,
you know,
so I don't know.

332
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.540
I guess that's,
that's my positive way of looking at it.

333
00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:31.840
By them bringing that horrific image into your head.
The fuck is wrong with me.

334
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.630
Um,
did I mentioned when I was in grand rapids,
Michigan,
I had a waffle,

335
00:20:37.631 --> 00:20:41.410
which I did say that right.
What's a waffle which you ask?

336
00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:45.070
It's a sandwich made out of a waffle with scrambled eggs and bacon and cheddar

337
00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:47.890
cheese in the middle of it.
And I still think I'm paying for it,
but you know,

338
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:52.660
something,
it was delicious.
I got to tell you.
I did enjoy that waffle.
Which,

339
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.770
um,
you know what?
I'm not even gonna fuck around.
I'm getting it right.

340
00:20:56.771 --> 00:21:01.540
Two emails here because this is something that's been bugging me.
Emails.

341
00:21:01.541 --> 00:21:05.500
Red is dead,
Billy,
ready to shoes.
Uh,

342
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:10.330
they said that by 2060,
all redheads might be gone.

343
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.820
Also,
the Greeks believed redheads turned to vampires after they died.

344
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.150
Thanks and good luck.
All right.

345
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.830
The key word in that is they say,
I guess that's words.

346
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.910
They say that by 2060s,
by 2060,

347
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:29.470
all redheads might be gone.

348
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.700
Do you realize how fucking dumb you have to be to believe that

349
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.740
all redheads are going to be gone by 2060.

350
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.290
That's literally 47 years from now.

351
00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.450
I mean,
granted by 20 in 2060 I'm going to turn 92.

352
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.920
I'm an old fuck right now.
I'm 45 years old this year.
By 2060,

353
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.660
I will be 92 years old,

354
00:21:56.661 --> 00:22:01.400
but that's best possible mind if I keep eating waffle witches and have my house

355
00:22:01.401 --> 00:22:04.640
collapsed on me.
I imagine that's going to take a toll.
All right?

356
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.070
For all you fucking morons out there who hear that in a bar or read it on the

357
00:22:10.071 --> 00:22:14.060
Internet and you just keep repeating it without even thinking of what's coming

358
00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:18.080
out of your mouth.
How many little red headed boys and girls,

359
00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:22.820
if you seen go to the mall,
the fucking two,
three years old,

360
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.110
you're telling me they're all going to be dead before they are 50 you're dumb

361
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:31.420
fucks
this so fucking dumb.

362
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.980
Some asshole said it was a recessive gene and by the time it went around the
bar,

363
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.630
we were all going to be dead in 20 minutes and people are so fucking dumb and

364
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:42.190
they just repeat what they hear,

365
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.830
that they come at you and they say dumb shit like that.

366
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:47.020
Do you realize how many people have said that to me?

367
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.640
I mean at least this guy was smart enough to at least put it to twenties,
20,
60.

368
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.890
I mean,
look,
if we're all going to be gone,

369
00:22:56.891 --> 00:23:00.550
we're fucking taken you converse with us because unless you guys just like,

370
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:05.730
if the next Hitler comes along and he just really hates fucking redheads and

371
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:06.580
starts to,

372
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.810
but even then there's going to be one of those Schindler list guys who's going

373
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.510
to make a list of his fucking redheads and we're going to survive.

374
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.113
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

375
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.980
<v 1>Right.
And then we'll have a museum of tolerance for fucking redheads.</v>

376
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.470
And then the history channel will slowly stop showing holocaust stuff and try

377
00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:30.000
and balance it out and show some redhead genocide,
you know,

378
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.220
and then there'll be some,
some uh,
Steven,
uh,
ready Red Berg.

379
00:23:35.221 --> 00:23:40.221
We'll make some fucking movie and get a bunch of awards and then the Howard

380
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.990
Stern of,
then we'll make the analogy like a towel you got to do,

381
00:23:42.991 --> 00:23:45.500
if you want to make a fan of fucking winning award is,

382
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:49.010
makes some sad movie about the red Ed genocide.

383
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.510
Let me tell you,
fucking Blondie's you brownies,

384
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:57.860
you Blackie's all you fuckers black.
You said it didn't sound good.

385
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.560
It was talking about hair.
Oh,
Geez.
All right.
We're here to stay.

386
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:08.360
All right.
Don't ever asked him out and estimate the fucking heart of a redhead.

387
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.820
Okay.
That's why it Harris read that said,
burning passionate is,

388
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.490
it's not the devil.
It's cause we're better than you were a select few.

389
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:21.020
You know what I mean?
You know what you guys are you fucking blondes,
Brunettes,

390
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.860
all you and you've got,

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.230

All right,

393
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.620
Has that ever been done?
Has anybody ever been,

394
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:43.730
had a fucking swagger about being a redhead?

Who gives a fuck?
I don't give a shit.
That's not my God.
Damn.

423
00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:22.360
Cause you know what?
I can,
I can guarantee you this right now.

424
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:26.470
I'm still going to be around in 2060 and I'll be out there climbing that fucking

425
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:30.490
rope and I'll have the last bit of lead paint and as best as Outta my house.

426
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.963
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

427
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.570
<v 1>And we'll see.
And then you guys be at,</v>

428
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:38.840
well technically not ready at a more cause all you fucking hair fell out in the

429
00:26:38.841 --> 00:26:40.790
shit on the side of your head is,
is white.

430
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:49.340
And that might do me in.
Now I'll be like,
oh shit.
Now fucking grab my chest,

431
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.900
clutched my little freckled heart and I'll keel over.
And you know what?

432
00:26:53.901 --> 00:26:54.920
You know what you guys will do.

433
00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:00.100
You'll fucking laugh because in your core you're a cunt.

434
00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.960
All right.
Hey Bill.
Okay.
I want a boyfriend.
Here we go.
Oh Geez.
Here we go,

435
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.150
Bill.
I want a boyfriend.
Hey Bill,
I know you're pro.

436
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.820
You probably just read the subject and when all will drop your panties,
bitch.

437
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:18.350
Now I would never do that.
That's if you said you wanted to get laid.
Um,

438
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:23.390
so anyways,
she says that's not quite the case.
Um,
I'm a guy.
Oh,

439
00:27:23.391 --> 00:27:26.990
the left turn.
The left turn.

440
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:33.130
I don't even need to read this.
Oh wait,
he's only a freshman.
I was going to say,

441
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.650
how was the guide?
You not know how to get a boyfriend at this point.

442
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.980
Have to sitcoms of are based on gay guys at this point,
aren't they?

443
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.200
Was that was that fucking statement?

444
00:27:42.201 --> 00:27:45.170
As dumb as all redheads are going to be dead by 2060,
I don't care.

445
00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:48.440
I got ahold of my fucking house.
He says,
I'm a guy,

446
00:27:48.441 --> 00:27:51.740
I'm a freshman in high school and I liked guys I'd consider myself.

447
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.270
I consider myself average,

448
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:57.770
pretty good at sports and decent with the ladies.
He said,

449
00:27:57.771 --> 00:28:01.880
I'm still in the closet.
Uh,
okay guys.
Fucking slay it.

450
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.900
You guys fucking it.
You know if you wanted to.

451
00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:07.200
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

452
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.630
<v 1>if you want it to,
I'm telling you,</v>

453
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.260
you know what it is cause you want gotta I dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck it is.

454
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.280
This,
you give a fuck about clothes the way they do.
Well,

455
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:21.060
you want to watch the same shit.
That's the thing about gay guys.

456
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:24.720
You guys want to do the same shit women want to do.
So hence you are around them.

457
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.770
And next thing you know you're Dixon their mouth.
If I could just keep my,

458
00:28:28.771 --> 00:28:32.550
if I could have just kept my fucking mouth shut,
you know,

459
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.520
during dirty dancing and ghosts and all those things,

460
00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.180
I would have done much better when I was a younger man.
But whatever,

461
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.340
this isn't about me.
This is about Yo,
let's plow ahead.
He goes,

462
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:45.660
I go to a public school and there aren't many gays.
Well,
no,

463
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:48.300
not as far as you know.
Um,

464
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:52.620
I don't want some fabulous guy.
Just another normal guy like me.

465
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:57.570
I like that.
You don't want them to be like sit-com gay walking in a room going,

466
00:28:57.571 --> 00:29:01.210
oh my God,
love that.

467
00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:08.000
Are there any gay guys like that at this point?
Um,
anyways,

468
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.710
what advice could you give someone in my position?

469
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.950
Maybe your lovely girlfriend as an opinion.
Thanks bill.

470
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:17.130
I love the podcast and go fuck yourself.
You know what?

471
00:29:17.131 --> 00:29:19.980
I might even call Nia in for this one.
Hang on a second.

472
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:24.810
We put this fucking thing on pause.
All right.

473
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:26.790
The lovely knee.
Everybody can you just close the door,

474
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:31.791
by the way is a fucking cause the God damn fan trying to dry off the walls.

475
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.030
Come over here.
We don't,
we only have one microphone.

476
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.460
Our Shit is all over the place,

477
00:29:38.461 --> 00:29:42.230
so I don't even know where the hell the other microphone is.
Right?
All right,

478
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.900
so here's the deal.
I feel like it was singing backup for somebody right now.
Um,

479
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.680
this dude wants a boyfriend.
He's a freshman in high school.
Uh,

480
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.010
he's still in the closet,
laying it with the ladies.

481
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.150
He doesn't want some fabulous guy.
He just wants another normal guy like himself.

482
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.960
He said,
what advice could you give someone in his position?

483
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.980
Maybe your lovely girlfriend has an opinion.
Thanks,
Bill.
Loved the podcast.

484
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.580
Oh and go fuck yourself.
So he's in the closet,

485
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.010
but you want to meet a guy,
Jesus Christ.
What did I just say?

486
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.610
What did he just say?
I'm just trying to light taking the situation.

487
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.550
I mean first of all,
I feel like if you've been drinking,

488
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:24.430
you have wine on your breath,
drinking champagne and the other room,

489
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.150
it's four o'clock in the afternoon.
Um,
I think,

490
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.580
I mean I,
first of all,

491
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:33.610
I think you should maybe not necessarily come out of the closet to everyone,

492
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.090
but you have to sort of go where the gay is go.

493
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.660
And I don't mean just bars and stuff,

494
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.760
but there are certain like restaurants and like areas that are,
you know,

495
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.970
heavily given like a PowerPoint,

496
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.610
a PowerPoint like presentation and like you have to go where the gays go.

497
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:55.120
You should just written that down on a chalkboard thing is I think it's a little

498
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:56.980
bit problematic that you're still in the closet.

499
00:30:56.981 --> 00:30:59.320
You are free to come out whenever you want to.

500
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.310
You shouldn't tie my timeout timeout.
But I'm saying when you're,

501
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:04.420
when you're out of the closet,

502
00:31:04.421 --> 00:31:08.470
it makes it easier for you to meet other people and get into a whole little

503
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:11.770
groove and you meet people on,
they invite you places here,
there and everywhere.

504
00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:16.010
And that's how you start to meet people now you can't,

505
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:17.800
when you're still in the closet,

506
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.240
there's going to be that secretiveness and that sort of sneaking around and

507
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:25.510
hiding and ducking and corners and you start getting the situations that you

508
00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:28.390
don't want to be in as a closet,
a gay person.

509
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.740
Cause I feel like any gay person who's lived their life in the closet trying to

510
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:35.140
date eagerly will tell you no,

511
00:31:35.141 --> 00:31:40.141
we'll tell you that it could lead to not so good situations.

512
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.690
So I feel like you should probably come out in a way,

513
00:31:43.691 --> 00:31:46.360
or at least just start hanging out with other gay people.

514
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.780
I want to have to start it.
Just start playing when you're answering goes off.

515
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:51.850
Do you want me on here to answer questions?

516
00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:54.720
I'm going to answer it the way I answered them.
I don't need you to tell me when.

517
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.580
I don't need anybody telling me how to answer him.
Snap,
snap,

518
00:31:57.581 --> 00:31:59.050
snap asked me to come in here.

519
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:01.900
If you're just getting to like micromanage how I answer the question,

520
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.330
what is wrong with you?
You know,
you're an angry drunk.

521
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.770
Not try a couple of glasses of champagne.
You turn it into an asshole.

522
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.870
I don't think you should come out.

523
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.710
Not as a freshman for fuck sakes.
People as such,
assholes.
You know what I mean?

524
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.520
I think he should just,
I think you should go find some other college.

525
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.620
He's a freshman in high school.
Oh,
in high school.
You know,

526
00:32:23.621 --> 00:32:28.420
fucking just ride it out.
Fight some other gay kids.
Hang out with them.

527
00:32:28.421 --> 00:32:32.410
Play baseball down at the,
uh,
the gay baseball park.

528
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.700
And uh,
and then once you become a,
you keep watching,

529
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.920
you know what you need to do,
you've got to lead your fucking town behind.

530
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.670
Then you move to a shitty does your high school and not have towards city.

531
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.580
Let me finish my ignorance.
Don't move to a city.
They'll have the gay,

532
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:48.050
the gay part of town.
Well,
no,

533
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.980
it's got to be over because a lot of the high schools that have abs shut up.

534
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:55.670
A lot of more progressive high schools.
They'll have like an LGBT,
you know,

535
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:58.850
club or something like that.
Oh,
he obviously doesn't have that already.

536
00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:01.490
We'd fucking join it.
He went,
he's going to high school.

537
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:05.030
Like I went to high school,
you know,
get back on.
Right.

538
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.480
It's a fucking meathead school.
That's what's going on with him.

539
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.940
Those morons aren't going to understand them.
Why,

540
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:12.430
why go through extra fucking pain?

541
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.470
The great thing is he knows who he is and he knows the direction he's going.

542
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.170
You're going to be fine.
Uh,

543
00:33:17.171 --> 00:33:21.770
I would say try and stay in shape because you are trying to appeal to a bunch of

544
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:24.290
guys and we're all fucking,
uh,
you know,

545
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.190
I just don't want him to start crotch trolling around online.

546
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.610
Getting sucked into some seedy situations.

547
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.620
These were older guys are going to take advantage of themselves because he's

548
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:36.890
young and in the closet and he's very,
you know,
he doesn't quite know what to do.

549
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.401
I just,

550
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:40.850
I'm worried that he's going to get sucked into that type of shit as oppose to

551
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:44.030
trying to find peers where you're all sort of going through it together.

552
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.870
That's why I was encouraging to come out of the closet or to at least maybe

553
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:48.980
start affiliating if your,

554
00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:53.390
if your high school has one of those LGBT clubs or whatever,
you know,

555
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:56.000
that way you,
you feel less alone so you're less likely to,

556
00:33:56.001 --> 00:34:00.920
like I say go online and get sucked into some weird head trip sexual abuse

557
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:02.390
situation dude.

558
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.530
Cause there's nothing like an older and know that an older Predator will love

559
00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:10.630
more than a young confused.
I'm still in the closet.
Wait a minute now not.

560
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.900
So you're saying older gay guys are predators and saying there are older people

561
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:18.950
who will prey on the young,
young,
well listen,

562
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:22.100
50 year old guys will try and bang an 18 year old chicks.
So why would,

563
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:24.320
why would it so what he's saying,
we're all pieces of shit.

564
00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:25.940
What kind of hatred or you spewing,

565
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.060
I'm just saying I want to bring the world together.

566
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.750
He is in a very precarious situation and if you start going down that road where

567
00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:36.800
you're just sneaking around so much,
you can get caught up into some bad shit.

568
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.230
And I don't want some older guys and Oh shit,

569
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:42.290
he's getting blown by fucking chicks.
This guys killing.

570
00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:46.910
It's like he's hitting it from both sides of the plate.
So are you buying?
No,

571
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.880
he's still in the closet,
but he's killing it with the ladies.

572
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.990
Well you need to stop that right now.
I know he doesn't cut fam.

573
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.180
It's just going to be another chapter in the book.

574
00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.710
I think you're going to be fine,
sir.
The Nia,
they his podcast.
It's on its way.

575
00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:02.960
Everyone on Twitter.
I know you guys have been asking me for weeks.

576
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.340
What's going on with the podcast?
What's happening is I'm also rebuild.

577
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.830
Are you fighting with your record label?
What's going on?

578
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.970
Why is this project keeping delayed now?

579
00:35:10.971 --> 00:35:14.330
I'm rebuilding my website right now and it's got my films on and it's got some

580
00:35:14.331 --> 00:35:18.970
writing.
That's your podcast.
Rome is underwater.
My podcast room is under water.

581
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:23.240
My sanctuary is destroyed,
but that's why it's taking so long.

582
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:26.030
So bear with me you guys,
but you should do,

583
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:30.050
you should do a podcast underwater in a flooded room.
Just like Kanye West.

584
00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:32.210
He had a busted jaw.
He still went in the studio.

585
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.770
All right.
All right.
All right,
well listen,
we were just fucking around there.

586
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.350
I think the great thing is that you already know who you are,

587
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.770
so you're going to end up where you want to be.
Um,

588
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.500
that age is really isn't easy for,
for anybody.
But uh,
I will tell you this,

589
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.030
all of all the fucking bullshit.

590
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:54.900
She said she's right about those creepy old gay guys looking for a young,

591
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:58.440
confused young man out there.
You know,
you're better than that.
All right?

592
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.730
You got to ask some standard no white chest hair.
Beat it.
Old pubes

593
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:10.410
Alrighty.
Plowing ahead.
What do we got here?
Dilemma.

594
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.311
Hey Bill,

595
00:36:11.311 --> 00:36:15.840
would you rather be permanently invisible under the condition that inanimate

596
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:20.841
objects you've touched also become invisible Jesus Christ?

597
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.820
Or would you want to be able to shape shift into anyone or anything in the

598
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:30.960
world?
But you have to stay that way for 24 hours.

599
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.470
Oh,
without a doubt,
shape shift.
I mean,

600
00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:37.530
how long they would it be if I was invisible and everything I touched became

601
00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:40.200
invisible,
I wouldn't want to do that.

602
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.263
<v 0>You know</v>

603
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.550
<v 1>what?
I want to do that.</v>

604
00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:50.470
How could I bring down these fucking international bankers if I was invisible

605
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.660
that can make inanimate shit invisible.
Oh,
that's what I would do.

606
00:36:54.661 --> 00:36:57.600
I touch a bunch of guns and given to the regular people and have them go down to

607
00:36:57.601 --> 00:37:01.980
one of those fucking devil's islands meetings.
Um,
no,
I wouldn't do that shit.

608
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.210
No,
I'd be a shape shifter.
Now the real question is,

609
00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:10.110
who would you shape shift into Troy Aikman?
You know,

610
00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:12.510
I'd commentated game right out of the back,
you know,

611
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.880
right out of the gate to see if people could notice.
I have,

612
00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:18.300
I have some of those gloves that he has.
You know this,
I'm an adult guy.
Gloves.

613
00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:21.990
Now,
the ones Dan Marino used to sell,
I got one of those long.

614
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.040
It's wintertime coach and sometimes I wear a suit,
you know,
kind of coach.

615
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:30.900
I could stand there with fucking ear muffs on,
uh,
what would I sound like him?

616
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.260
Who would I shape shift into?
It's a fucking weird one.

617
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:39.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

618
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.721
<v 1>Oh,
I,
you know what,</v>

619
00:37:40.721 --> 00:37:44.290
I couldn't handle that power because that basically if you could shape shift,

620
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.560
all you'd have to do is shape shift into any girl you ever wanted to fuck

621
00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:53.440
whoever she's fucking,
you just shape shift into that person.

622
00:37:53.441 --> 00:37:56.830
You just come walking through the door.
Hello.
You know,
with some flowers.

623
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.900
Oh my God,
I'd be the first person brought up.

624
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:08.840
Now what kind of rape would that be?

625
00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:15.260
The shape shift and rapist,
you know?
And then they'd have to somehow,

626
00:38:15.261 --> 00:38:16.730
how would they stop me from shape,

627
00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:21.470
shifting myself into the foreman of the jury to say,
we the jury final,

628
00:38:21.471 --> 00:38:24.620
Billy rape is red phase,
not guilty on all charges.

629
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.520
After that Big Jake is Christ.
Um,

630
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:35.210
oh,
there'll be in a shape shifter would be great,
man.

631
00:38:35.211 --> 00:38:36.180
You could freak the fucking

632
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.410
<v 0>world out.
You know,</v>

633
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:42.250
it'd be great if some like huge leader of the world was,

634
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.080
was given a speech and you somehow got behind them.

635
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.430
And we're also on TV jumping up and down,
you know,

636
00:38:47.431 --> 00:38:50.540
like somebody who painted that face except you look just like the guy giving the

637
00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:55.070
speech,
you know,
oh,
that could be endless fucking fun.

638
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.480
<v 1>How would I handle shape shifting?
Ah,
Jesus.</v>

639
00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:05.230
That'd be a lot of conversations with a higher power with that one.
You know,

640
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:08.770
like when you drink and then you get sick and like,
ah,
God,
I swear to God,

641
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:10.930
I'm never gonna do that again.
Just let me get through this.

642
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:12.910
I swear to God and we to clean up my fucking act.

643
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.000
Like what do you say to God after you just shape,

644
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:18.000
shifted into your neighbor and fucked his wife?

645
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.730
God,
if you can find it in your heart.
I mean,
technically,
you know,

646
00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.930
she doesn't know.
She's none the wiser.
And uh,

647
00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.810
I know it was rock and uh,
I'll say a couple of hail,
hail Mary's.

648
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:41.210
I promise I will not shape shift into anybody today.

649
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.020
That's all.
I mean,
I know some of that's one of the things when a,

650
00:39:45.021 --> 00:39:48.140
after I died and God's given me that you go into hell,
look,

651
00:39:48.141 --> 00:39:52.400
now I'm just going to be like,
dude,
I mean,
come on.
I could shape shift.

652
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:53.810
All right.

653
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:57.410
Half the people on Earth can't even handle becoming a bouncer without being a

654
00:39:57.411 --> 00:39:59.060
Douche.
I could shape shift.

655
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.520
What'd you think I was going to turn into fucking Ronald Mcdonald's and push

656
00:40:03.521 --> 00:40:05.580
some kid on a swing.
All right.

657
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

658
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.040
<v 1>There was some hotties that lived on my block and uh,</v>

659
00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.970
some other guys got to him before I did and I should have been man enough to

660
00:40:14.971 --> 00:40:18.330
accept that.
But you know,
I had this,
uh,

661
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:23.390
get out of jail free card so I shape shifted it to them when they were a away on

662
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:30.240
business.
Then I would just come home,
surprise home a day early

663
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.920
and then I fucked him and then I left and then I let her deal with the weirdness

664
00:40:38.191 --> 00:40:43.080
the next day when her husband came home,
when he came home a day later,
hey,
hello,

665
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.280
how are you?
What do you mean your home?
Where where,
where are you?

666
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.900
Yeah.
I thought you were just in the bedroom and then he's like,

667
00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:55.250
what the fuck's going on?
Jesus Christ.
You know something?

668
00:40:55.251 --> 00:40:58.380
I thought they had made every porno that you could make this.

669
00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:02.870
That's a whole new shape shift and porn shape shifting porn.

670
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:07.060
Discovered right here on the Monday morning podcast.
Um,

671
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.490
all right,
what the fuck else am I getting it?

672
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.850
That's all the emails I had this week.
That's all I got.
Oh,
for fuck sakes.

673
00:41:13.851 --> 00:41:17.970
You know what?
You know something.
Don't want to seem worse.

674
00:41:17.971 --> 00:41:21.780
I didn't watch any fucking hockey this week.
I watched nothing.

675
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.250
I didn't even get to enjoy the fucking Boston Bruins winning street in nothing.

676
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.880
Sean Thornton beaten the shit out of that fucking Rinaldo guy.

677
00:41:29.881 --> 00:41:32.100
Whatever the hell his name is.
I missed all of that.

678
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.850
I missed all that cause I was,
I
was on the road again chicka boom chicka boom,

679
00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.940
boom,
boom.
You know,
it was a great gig too.

680
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:42.530
I did the Fountain Street Church for laugh fest out in grand rapids,
Michigan.

681
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:47.210
And what was phenomenal about that was a,
I got to perform in a church.

682
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.970
I got to go up on the pulpit,
give a little speech.
I had a great time.
You know,

683
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.500
it's amazing,
isn't it?
Reminded me of Old Tiger Stadium.

684
00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.773
<v 0>MMM.</v>

685
00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:02.910
<v 1>Because Old Tiger stadium was one of the few stadiums that the only stadium</v>

686
00:42:02.911 --> 00:42:06.240
major league that had an upper deck that went all the way around and this church

687
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.240
had an upper deck that went,

688
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.380
<v 0>yeah,</v>

689
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.140
<v 1>all the way around the church from one side of the altar all the way to the</v>

690
00:42:13.141 --> 00:42:16.530
other.
And then the altar was up there.
And uh,
I don't know,

691
00:42:16.531 --> 00:42:18.300
made me feel like I was in an old ballpark.

692
00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.243
<v 0>All right,</v>

693
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.750
<v 1>let me see here.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Here we go.</v>

694
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.800
Ah,
Shit.
You know what I'm doing right now?
I'm trying to,
I'm like,

695
00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.080
so I can fill out the rest of this podcast.
I'm looking for a,

696
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

697
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.900
<v 1>I'm looking for emails.
This isn't good.</v>

698
00:42:35.901 --> 00:42:38.570
This isn't good to be doing on a live podcast.
Somebody texted me,

699
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:42.470
you think Bonham is good.
Could he do this in six inch?

700
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:48.000
An a six inch stiletto.
Alright.
Oh,
Sheila e.

701
00:42:48.001 --> 00:42:49.340
Yes,
she Lee.
He kills it.

702
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.420
I still think I still think bond was better than Sheila e come on.

703
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.653
<v 0>You know,</v>

704
00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.090
<v 1>plus John Bonham was,
he was sort of a fashion Easter.</v>

705
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.280
Used to wear those silly little boots all the time.
He could still fucking,

706
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:04.960
he could still kill it.

707
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.170
What does it with everybody always trying to fucking fall?

708
00:43:08.171 --> 00:43:12.580
I guess he's the benchmark,
right?
Um,
although Sheila is to shit.

709
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

710
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.580
<v 1>All right,
here we go.
I find an email.</v>

711
00:43:15.581 --> 00:43:18.070
I'm just going to start randomly reading these right now.
Hey Bill,

712
00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.470
I'm an avid fan of your podcast.

713
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:25.480
As I listened to it every Monday with my chemistry Tuta who is now a fan of

714
00:43:25.481 --> 00:43:29.830
yours as well.
Well,
Jesus,
you guys aren't getting anything done.
Are you?
Um,

715
00:43:29.831 --> 00:43:32.890
I have a question to ask and forgive me if I give you a history lesson,

716
00:43:32.891 --> 00:43:36.820
but this is something I want to get off my chest.
Holy Fuck.
Is this along?
Ah,

717
00:43:36.821 --> 00:43:40.630
come on people.
Try not to get things off your chest.

718
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.710
You know how bad I read.
All right,
let's give it a shot.

719
00:43:44.711 --> 00:43:47.320
You know what the first thing I'm gonna do want to make it lodge Ya.
All right?

720
00:43:47.321 --> 00:43:50.890
It's kind of personal for me,
but you as a man might understand,

721
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:54.340
and I'm not saying a woman would understand better because she probably would

722
00:43:54.341 --> 00:43:58.270
never understand it.
All my problem,
I am a loner and I have always been.

723
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.420
I relate to that serve 100%.
We are on the same page.

724
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.290
I never made any friends as a kid and I was abandoned by everyone.

725
00:44:05.291 --> 00:44:07.840
I knew that right now.
You just went into the fucking,

726
00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:12.760
now you sound like you're written.
Um,
now what does it Hans Christian Anderson,

727
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.780
what's the name of that guy who wrote a that toy story?

728
00:44:16.781 --> 00:44:18.990
What the fuck is it called?
They're a Christmas story.

729
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.240
Christmas Carol Christian,

730
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.920
Christian Laettner and I can't fucking thing ghost of Christmas cast part too.

731
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.281
Anyways,

732
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:34.230
I don't know anything about my family members because their name besides your

733
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:37.440
name and job title.
Over the years I started to hate everybody.

734
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.500
I came into contact with every person I met.

735
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:45.501
I'd be condescending towards and I was indifferent towards everyone I met a few

736
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.930
years ago.
I had this girl try and become my friend,

737
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:52.230
which is weird because since I keep to myself and nobody bothers me,

738
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:55.290
but all of a sudden this girl comes up to me and starts asking about who I am.

739
00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.750
I of course,
tell it a fuck off
Jesus Christ.

740
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:04.950
Dude.
He goes,
I told her to fuck off and I'm cold and indifferent.

741
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:09.420
You're not indifferent.
You have a definite feeling towards her.
Fuck off.
Uh,

742
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:13.110
she rode the same bus I wrote and she tried to make conversation with me a lot,

743
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:17.760
but still I was just telling you to fuck off,
but not in those exact words.
Okay.

744
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.050
All right.
But,
uh,
I told her to go talk to someone.
Who cares,

745
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.960
dude,
how old are you?
Every time I looked at her,
she always smiled at me.

746
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.680
The smile was the most amazing smile I've ever seen in my life.

747
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.750
If a smile was a super,
yeah,

748
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:38.751
you fucking had a crush on her for smile was a super powered be hers and I

749
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:43.500
couldn't help but melt a bit.
Every time I saw her smile,
Jesus Christ,

750
00:45:43.501 --> 00:45:47.460
to what's going on here.
Few years ago I got into every,

751
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:52.820
I got everyone in the school coming up to up to me asking who I was.

752
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.793
A few years later,

753
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.070
it turns out that she was asking everybody about me for two years and nobody

754
00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:00.450
could tell her anything about me.

755
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:04.650
So now she has gotten the whole school interested in me and finding out who I
am.

756
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:08.390
Dude,
is this like a fantasy or did this really happen?

757
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:11.910
Do you wear like a leather jacket and ride a motorcycle?
Um,

758
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:14.700
they never learned anything about me.
Now that I'm in college,

759
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:18.420
I'm starting to see her everywhere.
If Joe can you just fucked this girl,

760
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:21.560
I'd take her up for a malt already.
Come on,
man.

761
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:26.210
Did is a critical part of your life.
You're young,
this girl's cute.

762
00:46:26.211 --> 00:46:30.330
You're still,
you're drafted in the first round.
You don't want to wait too long.

763
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.750
You wait too long to fucking find a mate.
All of a sudden you know,
you,
you,

764
00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:40.680
you're trying to find some fucking once in a lifetime,
six round pick,

765
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.370
you know,
like a Tom Brady.
It's not out there.

766
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.910
Um,
he goes,
wait.
Anyways,
when we actually meet,

767
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:51.960
it's awkward and she just stares at me uncomfortable.
He then runs away.

768
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:57.830
I don't know why this happens to me whenever I think I see what,

769
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.180
I don't know why this happens to me.

770
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.050
Whenever I think I see here are actually running to her.

771
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.820
Is there something wrong with me?

772
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:09.480
Why am I going through this weird bouts of fight or flight mode?

773
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.930
Do it because you were fucking abandoned by everyone around you,

774
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.740
which hurt you as a kid.
So now you're trying to fucking wall yourself off.

775
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.380
You should fucking talk to that girl.
Just tell us.
Say,
listen,

776
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.660
you got to understand I'm a psycho.
I didn't have anybody in my life.

777
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:27.000
I don't know how to do this,
but when you smile at me,

778
00:47:27.001 --> 00:47:29.130
I almost fall out of my chair.
Kate,

779
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.530
can you handle the fact that I'm socially

780
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:35.280
a little far behind?

781
00:47:35.281 --> 00:47:39.280
My peers and with that would you like to go see a movie?

782
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.770
Okay.
And then every time you feel like sabotaging it just,

783
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:49.110
I dunno.
I Dunno dude.
That's,
that's you.

784
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.120
You're going to have to undo like 20 years of Shit.
It sounds like.

785
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:55.950
I don't know if you can do,
if you could do this,
uh,

786
00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.760
you know,
in one week,
you know,

787
00:47:58.761 --> 00:48:02.980
like those dumb doctor Phil shows you need to come out of your shell and

788
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:05.920
everybody claps and then you go and like the guy's supposed to be fixed.

789
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.170
It's going to take awhile.
But Dude,
you know something.

790
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.620
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

791
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.260
<v 1>you should definitely go after this girl if you fail and stuff like that,</v>

792
00:48:12.261 --> 00:48:15.770
you should definitely do it.
And uh,
she sounds like she's,
you know,

793
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.750
socially uncomfortable too.
So you know,

794
00:48:20.751 --> 00:48:22.910
you can help her,
she can help you,
both of you guys,

795
00:48:22.911 --> 00:48:25.370
you get a little more outgoing.
Next thing you know.
Yeah,
you might,

796
00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.470
you might have something there and if not,

797
00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:30.740
at the very least going through that experience with her,

798
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:33.890
we'll give you a couple at bats.
So when the right one comes along,

799
00:48:33.891 --> 00:48:38.210
you'll know what to do.
All right.
There you go.
Good luck to you sir.

800
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.970
Um,
all right.
What are we up to here?
Oh,
49 minutes.

801
00:48:44.971 --> 00:48:49.260
It's fucking drag.
And I'm sorry guys.
This is why I never do podcasts.
When I fly,

802
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.310
I stink.

803
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

804
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.010
<v 1>I,
I never should do podcasts when I fly out and come home and there's a fucking</v>

805
00:48:56.011 --> 00:49:00.900
hole in my ceiling.
All right.
Is that bad?
Oh,

806
00:49:00.901 --> 00:49:05.430
here's one.
Hey Bill,
you're being ripped off.

807
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:08.520
There's a video out there called steak in a Bj date.
No.
You know what?

808
00:49:08.521 --> 00:49:11.460
I ripped them off.
I actually read about it and I forgot.

809
00:49:11.461 --> 00:49:13.920
I read about it and I said that this should be staking a blowjob day.

810
00:49:13.921 --> 00:49:17.580
This is right there is why I don't watch other comedians acts because shit just

811
00:49:17.581 --> 00:49:20.220
flies into your head throughout the course of years and years and years.

812
00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.260
Then all of a sudden somebody asks a question,

813
00:49:22.261 --> 00:49:25.950
he give the answer and you think it's yours and it's not,
um,

814
00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.880
steak and a blow job that did not come up with that.

815
00:49:29.881 --> 00:49:32.820
Somebody else came up with that,
so I am not,
I am not offended.

816
00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.970
This is like you guys listening to me.
Just read my junk mail.

817
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:38.100
This is now what's going on right now.

818
00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.610
Could somebody please explain to me how the fuck and Montreal Canadians are in

819
00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:45.540
first place?
How do those cops suck in this still good?
You just at this point,

820
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.890
you just have to give it up to that franchise.
They just a good fucking French I,

821
00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:54.210
but you know something.
The fucking Pittsburgh Penguins,

822
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.120
Pittsburgh Penguins.
All of a sudden they're coming on.
You know what?

823
00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:02.430
Those motherfuckers,
those motherfuckers,
they always,

824
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.900
Dale like every time they went from Mario Lemieux,

825
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.730
then they got yarn mill yard,
right?
Then they had a little bit of a lull there.

826
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.600
Then they get old rosy red lips and they get Gino,

827
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.580
and then they also had fucking,

828
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.190
what's his face that they just traded to the hurricanes?

829
00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:22.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

830
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.770
<v 1>I can't think of anybody's fucking name.
And then you think like,
okay,
that's it.</v>

831
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:28.250
It's over.
Right?
How many fucking times?

832
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.540
They're like the fucking hockey version of the New York Yankees from the 1920s

833
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.410
to the 50s where it was Ruth Gehrig to Dimaggio to mantle.

834
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:40.640
That's what they're doing in hockey.
I Dunno,

835
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.953
this is my thing.

836
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:47.200
As long as the Montreal Canadians continue to suffer in the curse of Patrick Wa,

837
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.410
you know,
and they know it's occurs.

838
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.480
That's why they tried to make friends with them again,

839
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:57.380
because they realized after they booed him out of the city that he went to

840
00:50:57.381 --> 00:51:00.230
fucking Colorado and started when and I'm going,
they're like,

841
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:02.810
we don't know need him or her home.
We asked see material,

842
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:07.440
see blue block K ru's right.
They didn't give a fuck.
Now they give a fuck.

843
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:10.620
Now all of a sudden they're asking them,
hey,
yeah,
you know,
we're kind of,
uh,

844
00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.170
you know,
we will.
Sorry,
fucking phenomenal.

845
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:21.550
And every year that goes by more month old Montreal Canadien fans die and less

846
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:24.440
of them know what it's like to win a cup.

847
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.870
And I'm going to tell you,
I fucking love it.

848
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:31.910
You know what I love about Montreal Canadians fans?

849
00:51:31.911 --> 00:51:35.210
You know what they say to me now?
They bring up Gila floor.

850
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:40.190
That's how far in the past.
That's how far in the past.

851
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:45.220
Anything great happening between them and the Bruins are they go fucking ape

852
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:47.570
shit when they beat us now in the regular season.

853
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.140
You understand they owned us gala floor.

854
00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:55.670
Fuck Gigga floors scored that goal before I even watched my first fucking hockey

855
00:51:55.671 --> 00:51:59.270
game.
I don't know how old you people think I am.
That was like the late seventies

856
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:06.440
I was too busy recovering from being hit by a car.
I had enough to recover.

857
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.940
I get two days off from school.

858
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.420
I do remember that it happened on a Wednesday and the guy said,
all right,

859
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:13.610
you know what?
You shouldn't go to school Thursday,
Friday.

860
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:16.250
And I was fucking psyched going for once.
I don't have to fake sick.

861
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.640
And I sat there and I watched cartoons and I with a little spoon hate with a

862
00:52:22.071 --> 00:52:25.250
little spoon cause the bumper hit me right on the side of the head.

863
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.830
I've done this before in the podcast.
Put,

864
00:52:27.831 --> 00:52:29.870
put two fingers right on the side of your head,
right.

865
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.110
And then bite down on your molar suit,
your back teeth there.

866
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:36.260
You feel that thing that goes in and out.
That's right where I got hit.

867
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:37.160
So it hurt to chew.

868
00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.390
So I had to eat with a little spoon for two days and I couldn't go to school

869
00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:47.450
of the greatest things to ever happen to me.
This is CJ seven,
I believe.

870
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:52.850
Um,
big fucking guy getting out of it.
Oh my God.
I hit him by,
Ooh,

871
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.570
I totally fucking drove right into the guy.
I didn't look.

872
00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.200
I thought I looked is another guy.
St Stake and Bj Day,
uh,

873
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.930
um,
is spreading.
This had nothing to do with me.
It had nothing to do.

874
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:10.820
Not thing.
It's not mine.
It's somebody else's.
All right,
here we go.

875
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:13.700
Last thing I'm going to read and that's going to mercifully be the end of this

876
00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:18.130
uh,
podcast.
Bill thought this might interest you.
It's an article about divorce.

877
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.490
This guy's an illustrator.

878
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:24.730
Tough road to Hoe I am to three years and still no settlement.

879
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:29.730
The guys broke as a result and has stopped producing work in hopes that the

880
00:53:29.731 --> 00:53:34.290
parasitic x we'll give in once there's no cashflow.
Oh.

881
00:53:34.291 --> 00:53:39.000
And the guy is for Digi prodigiously good as a painter.
Yeah.

882
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:42.990
You know,
I take,
I actually have faith in some of these divorce settlements that,

883
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.100
um,
I think in the near future there's going to be way more.

884
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:47.843
<v 0>Okay.</v>

885
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.730
<v 1>Way More light shined on these things.
And uh,</v>

886
00:53:55.310 --> 00:54:00.140
eventually it's,
it's gonna,
it's gonna come around,
you know?

887
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

888
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.570
<v 1>Can't that be a,
I,
I just,</v>

889
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:10.530
I don't get that,
that shit where you can just,
it's,

890
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.870
it's just too one sided with one person could just live off the other person.

891
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.370
I've talked about all this shit a zillion fucking times,
haven't I?
You know,

892
00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:22.030
that whole shit where,
uh,
the woman starts dating a new guy,

893
00:54:22.031 --> 00:54:25.210
but she won't let the guy move in because their last guy made more money.

894
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:28.630
So then the two of them just sit there living off the fucking first guy.

895
00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:34.390
You know?
You don't think that's fucked up.
Well,
I do.
Um,

896
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:37.660
all right.
You know what people I tried,
I tried to,
I,
you know,
I did my best.

897
00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:42.040
I tried,
tried to do a podcast.
Um,
I think that's it.

898
00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:46.750
Saint Cole's water damage hockey.
Small towns.
Eating like a cunt.
Yeah,

899
00:54:46.751 --> 00:54:51.520
I got to stop doing that guys.
I've really let myself fucking,
ah,
it's weird.

900
00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:55.390
I look good with a shirt on,
but with a shirt off,
it's not a,

901
00:54:55.570 --> 00:55:00.370
it's not a good thing.
Like my chest is 35,

902
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.730
but my fucking,
what the fuck is this?

903
00:55:03.731 --> 00:55:07.330
Is this going to be another guy telling me and I got a [inaudible].
All right.

All right.
