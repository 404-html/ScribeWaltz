00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.950
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.951 --> 00:00:05.830
It's bill bar and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.831 --> 00:00:10.380
November 11th,
2013 how's it going,

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.223
Joe?

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.790
<v 0>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.211
<v 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:18.211
guess who got a Boston Red sox championship half the other day?

8
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:22.630
This guy,
this guy right here.
Oh,

9
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:25.300
I was there from October 7th on.

10
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.820
I'll tell you the mental anguish that I went through as a fan over those 23

11
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:35.830
days,
whatever the fuck it took them to win it.
But um,

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.720
I got to tell you,
I actually don't like the hat.
It's,

13
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.460
it just makes me feel old when I look at it.

14
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.780
It just used to just be the B and then it'd be like,
Oo,
2030 chill pizza.

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.090
That's all you needed.
Now they got,

16
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:54.200
they got the fucking trophy spinning out to the right.
The bees over here.
Right.

17
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:59.090
It's a fucking mess.
You know?
I don't know.

18
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.970
I just look,
I,
you know what I look like when I put it on,
I look like a,

19
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.670
I'm trying to start a rapping career.

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.980
Can I have the middle aged white guy?

21
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.400
Our team won a championship and I kind of sucked in gym class.
But God dammit,

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.250
I had heart white dude hat cause they make one of those.

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.570
I don't fucking know.
Oh,
I don't know.
Anyways,
I'm,
I'm,

24
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.810
you know,
not shitting on that,
you know,
thought that style of the hat.

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
I'm just saying,
it just looks dumb on my head.

26
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.920
You know,
I'm white.

27
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.040
Of course I observed sports.

28
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.710
Why would you pick me?

29
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.250
I am right where I'm supposed to be in the stadium.

30
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.320
I'm shitting in the stance.

31
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.940
How about having a little consideration for a rapidly aging balding

32
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.470
it give me a nice boring hat.

33
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.810
What am I fucking Ashton Kutcher?

34
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500
Is that an old reference me that fucker's in his 30 by now.

35
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.900
I don't know what happened the last 10 years,

36
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.380
but I've noticed it in my act when I go to make references.

37
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:25.640
I think I brought this up before I was doing a college gig.
So I'm up there,

38
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.850
I'm trying to be hip,
I'm trying to be down.

39
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.860
I Dunno what I was doing and I,
I made a reference,
I needed a reference for,

40
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.850
you know,
a young pup skanky kind of chick.

41
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:41.000
And I threw up Brittany Spears and dude,
I'm telling you,

42
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.880
absolute fucking crickets.
I got nothing on it.

43
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.810
And then I just did the math quickly in my head.
I'm like,
wait a minute.

44
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:52.811
Brittany Spears is like a 32 33 year old divorced mother of two at this point.

45
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.460
She's not that 18 1718 year old girl coming out there.
Hi.

46
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.730
Yay.
Yeah,

47
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 2>I pop my plus whatever the fuck she sang it.
A little fucking outfit.</v>

48
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.460
You know,
total entrapment.

49
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.450
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.770
<v 2>Hey,
once she's of age,</v>

51
00:03:09.771 --> 00:03:13.040
can you still go back and jerk off to that video or is that still looking at

52
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:13.874
kitty?
Yeah,

53
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.883
<v 0>porn.</v>

54
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.540
<v 2>Look,
I know in the video she's 17 but right now she's 26 show.</v>

55
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.960
Even if you split the difference,
she's like 23 right.

56
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.090
Um,
anyways,
so then I had to,
like,

57
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.730
I made a reference.
I did dom,
I rare as podcasts and we were talking about,

58
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.280
he busted me when I did.
Oh,
maybe it wasn't as podcast.
I did.

59
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.710
I did standup show down at the laugh factory,
the world famous laugh factory.

60
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.150
Everybody.
All right.

61
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:49.120
And if you're around the world and you've never heard of the world famous laugh

62
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.780
factory,
then I think you need to become a little more cosmopolitan,

63
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.340
a little more worldly.
Okay.
You got the Great Wall of China,

64
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.620
you got the octa trial and you have the world famous laugh factory on sunset

65
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:04.600
strip.
Alright,

66
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.870
what run by the always lovely.

67
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.760
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

68
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.660
<v 2>Jamie Masada.</v>

69
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.780
And I was down there doing a stand up thing and dom has this cool show where

70
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:15.940
like,
you know,
you do stand up and then after you'd done,

71
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.400
he comes up and he does these interviews,
which is more,

72
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.280
you just sit there breaking each other's balls and laughing your ass off.

73
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.130
So he called me out on,
um,

74
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.680
Dustin off some old topical material,
but I forget how I dropped into it.

75
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.420
Um,
but I,
I did the whole,
Oh,

76
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:38.500
speaking of this,
you know,
what's up with Monica Lewinsky?
I mean,

77
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:39.400
it wasn't that bad,

78
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.150
but it was one of those deals where he busted me and I laughed about it and I,

79
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:43.870
and I was,

80
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.370
I was reminded of this time in like the early two thousands I was working with

81
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:53.371
this fucking hack and he was on stage and he just goes out of nowhere.

82
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.440
He goes,
you know,
people are still talking about Oj.
He just,

83
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.840
the Oj Simpson trial was in 90 half of the debt.

84
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:06.841
The murder happened in June [inaudible] 94 and the trial concluded in October of

85
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.080
95 and it was 2002 and this guy goes,

86
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.380
people is still talking about o j seven fucking years later.

87
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.770
And then he proceeds to do material that wasn't seven years after the case kind

88
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:24.580
of thing.
It was like this was shit that he wrote while the trial was going on.

89
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.720
And anyway,

90
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.720
so I got to tell that story and I'm at the laugh factory and it's a crowd of 20

91
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:36.061
somethings and I tell it to dom and I want to say dom laughed but it got nothing

92
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.480
from the crowd.
And then I'm just looking going,
all right,

93
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:45.481
say like the average person here is 24 that means they were born in 1989 that

94
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.200
means Oj,
you know,
I shouldn't even see me.
He got acquitted,
right.

95
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.170
I never understood that case.
He got acquitted,

96
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.190
but he still had to give everybody all his stuff.

97
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.270
Like they need more evidence to send you to jail for life.

98
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.350
But you know,
to get all his stuff,

99
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.450
including his Heisman trophy,
all the others

100
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.900
<v 1>side just has to be,
I mean,
come on.
Yeah man.
You know we did it.
Who else?</v>

101
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.030
Wealth would have thought it.

102
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

103
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.010
<v 1>And then it's like,
you know the end of the a wheel of fortune.
You dislike.</v>

104
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.040
All right.
For slicing my daughters throat,

105
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:23.310
I'll take the dinette set for 700 that's disgusting.
Bellows,

106
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.280
a disgusting joke off.
Fuck you.
I got an hour to fill here talking to myself.
Ah,

107
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:32.480
what would you be talking about?
Six and a half minutes in.
Exactly.
Okay,

108
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.890
so sit back down and your plastic staples chair and you put your head down in

109
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:38.540
your desk inside of your fucking cubicle.

110
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:42.650
I don't hear another word out of you for the next fucking 53 and a half minutes.

111
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

112
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.120
<v 1>Okay.
I'm in no mood.</v>

113
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.060
I got to log podcast ahead of me.

114
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.720
And the last thing I need is someone like you getting off fucking up at eight

115
00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:53.710
next to your stapler.

116
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.653
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.800
<v 2>Anyways.
Yeah.
So I'm starting to feel my age.</v>

118
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.331
I mean,
I look,

119
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:08.331
I look phenomenal despite the top of my dome from just below my hairline down

120
00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:10.710
for my age.
I look phenomenal.

121
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.720
I though,
fuck you.
I look great.
All right.
I've seen other 45 year olds.

122
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.850
It's not a pretty sight.

123
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.210
And maybe it's because they got married and they had a bunch of kids,
right?

124
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.030
And they made them some omelets and the kids didn't finish it because they

125
00:07:27.031 --> 00:07:29.430
didn't have teeth yet.
So then you got to eat there on what's too,

126
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.680
and then you start walking sideways of your house.
You've corny good door GM,

127
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.543
right?

128
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.460
Can you just start using momentum to get to your car?
You know,

129
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.340
you put your belly right on the fucking driver's side door,
leaning against it.

130
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.330
You know,
like a heavyweight fight or trying to wear down his opponent.

131
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.530
He does lean it against your car is you fill in around trying to find your keys

132
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:58.880
in your pocket.
You literally have to take a break from carrying that bacon,

133
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:01.310
egg and cheese mass right in front of you.

134
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.860
The fucking suspension,
digging in on the opposite side of the car.

135
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.680
Like when I try to tip my dog over,
you know,

136
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.620
I don't know how difficult cow tipping is,

137
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:15.380
but trying to tip over a pit bull is practically impossible.

138
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:20.500
They get low and they put two of their bionic fucking legs on the opposite side

139
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:24.290
of their body and then they also have like web toes and they just dig into the

140
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.890
carpet.
Isn't that right Cleo?
Oh Dude,

141
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.330
I got to put up this video of her snoring the other night.
Last night.

142
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.350
She sounded like a fucking truck or who just got back from a fucking there and

143
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.740
back trip across the country.
Fuller.
Arby's.

144
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

145
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.170
<v 2>Laying on her back.
Fucking face.</v>

146
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:51.110
Twitch and rem sleep.
It just snoring.

147
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.280
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

148
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.250
<v 2>I dunno.
I don't think she got sleep apnea.
I don't know what her deal is.</v>

149
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:57.900
A fucking lover though.
So anyways.

150
00:08:59.060 --> 00:08:59.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

151
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.460
<v 2>How was I just talking about,
Oh yes.
I look good for my age,
but I'm,</v>

152
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.280
I'm starting to feel it,
feel it with the references.

153
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.990
So the other day I was working,
um,
the hell was,

154
00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:14.140
I had an unbelievable weekend.
I worked a DC,

155
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.240
New York and Philly and uh,
um,
um,

156
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.950
backstage in,
uh,
in New York City at the beacon theater.

157
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.100
All,
alright.
Legendary theater,
uh,

158
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.930
just beyond anything I ever thought about.

159
00:09:28.931 --> 00:09:31.930
I used to go to stand up New York on the upper west side and my whole fucking

160
00:09:31.931 --> 00:09:36.220
thing was just being able to get a spot there first on a weekday,

161
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.480
a scheduled spot,
not to get thrown up,
to actually have my name on the schedule.

162
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.580
He has a 10,
20.
Right.
And then it became,
can I do a weekend spot?

163
00:09:45.581 --> 00:09:46.960
But I,
I,
and you know,

164
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.130
I get off the subway and I'd walk by that theater a zillion times and it never

165
00:09:51.131 --> 00:09:56.131
even dawned on me that a comedian could even fucking play a place like that.

166
00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:59.230
That's how far away that was.
So,
um,

167
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.920
I hope if you were in the era you had a chance to come down there because I'm,

168
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.760
both of those shows were,
uh,

169
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.010
I dunno,
that was something else.
Something else.

170
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:14.200
So right up there with Carnegie or any of those other things.
And uh,

171
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:19.000
but there was something about the beacon that just,
it felt like a,
I dunno,

172
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.960
felt like I was at the cellar,
like comfortable was awesome.

173
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.320
So anyways,
yeah.
Jesus Christ.
I forgot what the fuck I was talking about.

174
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:29.750
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

175
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.310
<v 2>All right,
let's back it up.
Just how my brain works.
It goes in a straight line.</v>

176
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:34.330
So I got to,
you know,

177
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.840
like when you miss an exit and you got a backup back in the day and you'd go

178
00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:42.400
back and look at the sign
that got the car up,

179
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.170
or maybe he just pulled over and your dad got out all pissed off and left his

180
00:10:47.171 --> 00:10:50.530
family of five sitting on the side of the road waiting to be rear ended.

181
00:10:50.531 --> 00:10:52.420
What people didn't text when they drove back then.
So it was,

182
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:57.010
I guess it was normal.
All right.
Um,
AH,
shit.

183
00:10:57.011 --> 00:11:01.960
What the fuck was I talking about?
I can't remember.

184
00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:04.580
I literally cannot remember anything that I said before.
No Way.

185
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.770
I said a bad joke.
Oj dinette set

186
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.510
Christ and there it is.

187
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:16.440
And then and then it just hits the fucking beach and now here we are.
We're,

188
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.540
we're in.
We're in a fucking love.

189
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.610
I guess I was talking about eating like Shit,

190
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.330
you know I was doing so well.

191
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.660
I got myself down to about a buck 70 you know I'm watching that UFC the ultimate

192
00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:35.200
fighter,
right?
I'm watching that this season.

193
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.420
Everybody on the show is in shape.

194
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.480
The women are fucking taken it to the next level.

195
00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:44.140
They having some of the best fights of the season and it's making me want to

196
00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:46.820
work out.
And then I went on the road and this is a funny thing,
me,

197
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.020
I went out with Versie right?
And we're not drinking right now.

198
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.100
We're on the wagon,
although I drank and Thursday,

199
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.640
but I'm still,
I still considered on the wagon.
Wednesday I got fucked up and,

200
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.900
and I paid for it the whole day and I was like,
this is stupid.
I got to,

201
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.660
how many times do I have to learn this lesson?
Um,

202
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.730
so I got to tell you guys,
I,
I went to the Rangers game,

203
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.560
the Rangers Penguin's game on a,

204
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.870
<v 0>okay.</v>

205
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.850
<v 2>That was that Wednesday night.
I got to tell you what a fucking venue,
you know,</v>

206
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.950
they redid the whole thing seriously after going to,
uh,

207
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.680
the clippers warriors' game,

208
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:31.310
just being in the staples center because I really love La and I don't look at

209
00:12:31.311 --> 00:12:34.860
the people like that plastic phony or that type of shit.
But I gotta tell you,

210
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.960
haven't gone to that game Sunday night and then gone to Madison Square Garden.

211
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.730
Uh,
just,
you could not compare the atmospheres.
It was just fucking,

212
00:12:43.731 --> 00:12:45.800
I've talked to,
can I stop saying that annoying word?

213
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.840
The atmosphere side of Sadie was just,
it was electric.
Yeah.
But you could,

214
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.160
you could feel there was something palpable in the early,
the BBB,

215
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.050
the pirate literally that was to come.
Um,

216
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.370
that was fucking amazing.
There's just nothing like being in a stadium,

217
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.690
watching a team that has a history.
I'll be it a tragic one,

218
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.520
but it has a history and everybody just grew up watching them and they know the

219
00:13:13.521 --> 00:13:18.260
history of the game.
There's rivalries,
you just,
you feel it,

220
00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:20.060
you know,
it's like gay.
Yah.

221
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.420
It's like one of those home cooked meals that gets better every time you reheat

222
00:13:23.421 --> 00:13:26.550
it.
You know,
like a beef stew.
I'd Gumbo.

223
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.680
Let's throw that out there for the wonderful people down there in New Orleans.

224
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.990
I actually got home sick,
you know,

225
00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:35.390
last night when I watched a little bit of the saints cowboys,

226
00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.320
I watched a little bit of the saints cowboys game and um,

227
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.930
when they were shooting down the street,
you know,

228
00:13:41.931 --> 00:13:45.410
there was play that New Orleans music and shit.
And uh,

229
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.190
now Michael's or go on was sitting there talking about how they was shooting

230
00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:52.760
right down canal street.
And I stayed there at the hotel.
There was the hotel,

231
00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:56.180
there's the fucking Harris,
there's a cigar bar.
And I missed it.

232
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.050
But I gotta tell you,
I ended up shutting off the game because I was so tired.

233
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:03.831
And I,
what did,

234
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:07.850
I ended up watching this documentary on Dr Jay on the NBA channel.

235
00:14:07.851 --> 00:14:11.510
You guys got to see it.
Of course,
I don't know the name of it,
but uh,

236
00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.160
just on there,
they don't never made one like that.

237
00:14:16.161 --> 00:14:19.970
Never again before or after.
Just the combination.

238
00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:24.830
That guy was so fucking cool.
It's so classy.
And even to this day,

239
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.520
you want to talk about a guy aging,
well,
you know,

240
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.650
they said that he,
uh,

241
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:37.090
he can still dunk and I'm not going to say whether or not he proves that he can

242
00:14:37.131 --> 00:14:37.820
still do it,

243
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.820
but you definitely should watch the documentary of the shit that the guy was

244
00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:43.341
doing,

245
00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:47.180
especially with all you guys from the Jordan era or maybe the Colby era who just

246
00:14:47.181 --> 00:14:50.780
went just as far back as Michael Jordan if you want to

247
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.570
<v 1>how Michael existed or whatever is because he got to,
I mean,</v>

248
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:58.940
aside from obviously all his hard work and all that type of stuff,

249
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:03.530
but he got to watch a guy like,
like doctor Jay and uh,

250
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.700
they showed all the classic shit,
his dunk on Michael Cooper.

251
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.470
<v 3>MMM.</v>

252
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.600
<v 1>And then that one where in the 1980s finals,</v>

253
00:15:13.601 --> 00:15:17.830
what he drives baseline jumps up in the air and he's got the ball,

254
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.830
I think maybe in the third row,

255
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.150
sort of doing this sort of windmill thing swooping around.

256
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:26.801
And he's literally,

257
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:30.760
his momentum carries them out of bounds is some giant white dude.

258
00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:31.930
And I don't know if it was Karima,

259
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:36.931
who else just completely took away that side of the rim.

260
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.500
It was over.
So anybody else,
even an all star,

261
00:15:41.501 --> 00:15:44.770
maybe the best they could do is maybe look to see,

262
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.420
find somebody open underneath the basket to pass it to them or do the playground

263
00:15:49.421 --> 00:15:52.240
thing where you try to throw it off a defensive player and it's out on them.

264
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.130
Right?
But instead he just keeps flying through the air.
All right.

265
00:15:57.131 --> 00:15:59.380
There's two tall people blocking this side of the rim.

266
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.100
I think I'll just keep gliding through the air.
I'm starting to come down,

267
00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:04.990
so I'll pull my legs up a little bit.
Give me this,

268
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.550
give myself a little more hang time.

269
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.830
Comes back all the way to the other side of the basket,
everything.
But probably,

270
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.460
you know,
his halfway to his right forearm,

271
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:21.250
down to the tip of his fingers is out of bounds the other way and he just

272
00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:23.590
reaches back in bounds at the last second.

273
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.960
It puts like a reverse spin on the ball for a reverse layup on the other side.

274
00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:31.120
I can't explain it.
And it goes by so fucking fast.

275
00:16:31.121 --> 00:16:35.680
You have to watch it in slow motion.
Um,
they got that.

276
00:16:35.681 --> 00:16:38.980
They got all the Aba highlights and the stuffed,

277
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.310
they were given away like they had a dollar night or something like that,

278
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:47.370
that Nassau Coliseum where the New York nets plague when he was in the Aba and

279
00:16:47.411 --> 00:16:51.550
it was a dollar a ticket.
9,000 people showed up.
And if you showed up,

280
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:55.510
not only was your ticket only a dollar,
they gave away a free loaf of bread.

281
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.710
So then you start to see all that,
all that will Ferrell semipro stuff.
It's just,

282
00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:04.660
it's awesome.
And I'm actually looking it up right now,

283
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.900
doctor Jay documentary.

284
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:10.723
<v 3>MMM.</v>

285
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.420
<v 1>I guess it's just called the doctor watch NBA Tvs,</v>

286
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:20.110
the doctor full documentary.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
It's already up online.

287
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.360
This is fucking sons of bitches.
Definitely check it out.

288
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.250
And then they got all these awesome commercials

289
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.710
with all the fucking seventies music.
They had this one,
it goes,
hey,
hey.

290
00:17:29.711 --> 00:17:34.570
Dot j where'd you get those moves?
You move with such grace.

291
00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:38.650
Are you a member of the human race?
They literally go,

292
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:41.230
are you a member of the human race?
Like you'd pull it,

293
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.260
political correctness would never let you get away from that with the underlying

294
00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:48.790
racist comments.
What they were really trying to say was,

295
00:17:48.791 --> 00:17:52.350
we've never seen anybody play like that,
but you know,

296
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.160
those areas and countries of course would be like,
you know,

297
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.220
well that's exactly what we were saying,
right?
Team.

298
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.320
I guess the Nazi guys would talk like that,
right?

299
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.590
Do you actually have like a bad German accent?
Like I just did,

300
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.470
but you got to see it,
but you got to watch that commercial.
I'm going to,

301
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:10.110
I'm going to put a link up for that because then the dude,

302
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.690
the second verse that they don't show in the documentary,

303
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.490
he goes up into that fucking seventies falsetto.
It's the shit.

304
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:18.121
And they loved it.

305
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:21.510
She like was like memorizing the song and was walking around our house singing

306
00:18:21.511 --> 00:18:25.320
it last night.
Um,
which is why I love her.

307
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.910
All right,
so there's that.
So definitely check out,
uh,
the doctor on the NBH.

308
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.980
I'll watch it on the NBA channel.
All right.

309
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.790
Help out that zillion dollar business with they're mobbed up refs.

310
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.060
So anyways,
where the hell are we?
Oh my God.

311
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.940
Where did the last fucking 12 minutes golf?

312
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.520
It shifts really flies by when you're having fun.
Okay.

313
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:52.020
Time to do a little bit of advertising.
All right everybody,
here we go.

314
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.960
Bill's going to try to read out loud once again this week.

315
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.180
Is there any improvement,
any improvement at fuck.

316
00:18:58.181 --> 00:19:01.380
I'm already thrown it off the rails.
All right,
here we go.
Focusing,

317
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:05.910
taking our time relaxing,
maybe going a little slower,
letting it breathe.

318
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.890

322
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.990

323
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:30.360
from the car ashtray.
Actually that's not true.

324
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.590
I get stuck behind the people who wanted to,

I dunno stuff for their dentures.

326
00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:42.021
They also want to develop some film and buy some ice cream in the place I go to,

327
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.660

so that one person has to do all of it.

328
00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:48.840
So that's,
that's who I get stuck behind.
But let's pretend it is me.

329
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:53.310

372
00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:27.120
I'm like,
Oh my God,
I'm going to have a perfect game.
And then I messed up once.

373
00:22:27.121 --> 00:22:30.060
I'm like,
well,
I'm still going to beat three.
Then I had to and then I'm like,

374
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:30.894
don't blow it.

375

So that was three again.
Let's do one more here.</v>

377
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.480

I'll have to go a little slower.

397
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.580
All right.
I think that was the only two mess ups,
possibly three.

398
00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.720
All right.
Anyways,
let's get back to the,
uh,
let's get back to the old,

399
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.530
the old podcast.
They'll Rooney there.
Um,

400
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.910
so as I mentioned all this week they had the New York comedy festival,

401
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:12.710
which was why I was at the,
uh,

402
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.720
I was in New York City working at the beacon theater.
Um,

403
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.350
however we were sober.
This,
this is my weekend.

404
00:24:21.351 --> 00:24:26.210
I worked Dar constitution hall where Eddie Murphy Tape Delirious and Chris Rock

405
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:29.960
did I think never scared or shoot the Messenger.
I forget which one.

406
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.810
Um,
so I got to work that place and then I did the beacon,
you know,

407
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.790
which is the beacon.
And then I got to do the tower theater in Philly.
So,
um,

408
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.050
it was insane.
It was absolutely insane.
And this is my,

409
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:47.300
we couldn't have gotten any better,
um,

410
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.960
because it was the New York comedy festival.

411
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.120
There was all these big name comics that were in town.
And,
uh,

412
00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.200
Bill Cosby was working at the theater down in Madison Square Garden.

413
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.660
And,
uh,
it was on my bucket list.
You know,
I got to see this guy.

414
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:09.770
I saw Carlin,
I never saw a prior.
I have to see bill Cosby.

415
00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.080
Um,
I saw Don Rickles earlier this year.
And,
um,
you know,

416
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.560
there's a lot of people that I should have seen throughout my career and I never

417
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.410
did because I was too busy trying to get better myself.
And I was always like,

418
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:24.100
I'm going to see him,
I'm going to see him.
I'm going to see him.
And like,

419
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.800
like I never saw a Carlin when I was actually a standup comic where I could have

420
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:32.540
appreciated them even more.
I saw him in,
um,
I told you this story before.

421
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.380
I'll tell it again real quick.

422
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:35.660
Me and a buddy of mine psalm at the Cape Cod Melody Tent.

423
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.620
And we actually went down there to laugh at him,

424
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.240
if you can believe it because my buddy had convinced me that he was still doing

425
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:47.750
his more stuff bit that he hadn't changed up his stuff.

426
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:51.710
So we were driving to the venue,
drinking and laughing,

427
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:55.370
going more stuff like we just would like,
but going to go down there.

428
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.440
We actually used to go out,

429
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.760
like I went and I saw a live taping of the Morton Downey jr show.

430
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:06.200
We would go out to go see stuff like that to enjoy it and also laugh at the

431
00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:09.590
people that,
that thought it was great stuff.
Morton Downey,
Judy was great,

432
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:13.370
but come on.
It was a shit show,
right?
Uh,
we saw dice.

433
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.750
Um,
we love dice.
We saw him at the worst or central.

434
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.420
We didn't go down there to laugh at him by any stretch of the means.

435
00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:24.290
We went down there to fucking laugh my balls off and we did.
Um,

436
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.770
so he met the Worcester Centrum,
but we went to go see Carlin.

437
00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:28.730
We went down there to laugh at him,

438
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.380
think he was going to do well is old material.

439
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.130
And of course we go there and he had a brand new killer hour and he was 10 times

440
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:36.950
the comic that he was the last special.

441
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.910
Just how he just kept growing throughout his whole career.
So anyways,

442
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.680
but I never saw him when I was an actual standup comic.

443
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.970
I saw him when I wasn't a comic swell.
I knew it was just,

444
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.720
this guy was funny as hell.
Um,
so anyways,
long story short,

445
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.780
I was flying to New York and they had an article in the New York Post that said

446
00:26:57.541 --> 00:27:01.430
that a Cosby was in town and he was doing the festivals.

447
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.110
So I called up and I asked if there was any way I could stand in the back of

448
00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.780
Blahblahblahblahblah and just check them out.

449
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.630
And they hooked me up and they actually got me to the side of the stage and I

450
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:17.260
was thinking,
oh,
maybe,
maybe he'll just walk by and I'll get to shake his head.

451
00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:18.660
No,
I don't want to bug them,
I don't want to bug them.

452
00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:21.630
So I go backstage and of course there's like 40 people standing there because

453
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:23.850
you want to go,
you got to see bill Cosby.

454
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.600
So I'm standing there and then this woman goes,
hey,

455
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:32.370
you want to go up and meet him?
And I was like,
meet who?

456
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.810
And she was and I'm like,
Cosby.
And she was like,
yeah.

457
00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.940
So she starts walking up towards his dressing room and I'm just like,

458
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:45.450
I had fucking mud.
I'm walking in mud.
Like I was afraid,
I was afraid.

459
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.570
So I'm walking on when going,
are you sure it's okay?

460
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.150
Are you sure it's okay because this wasn't somebody running the festival.

461
00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:56.151
This was just like a pa that was bringing me up there and it's right before he's

462
00:27:56.731 --> 00:27:59.520
going on.
And I'm thinking like,

463
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.600
it just didn't seem like this was gonna happen.
So she walks up,

464
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:07.680
knocks on his door,
I hear somebody say,
come in,
that's not him.

465
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.380
And they opened the door and there he is sitting there with one other guy.

466
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:16.610
And so I walk in thinking I'm going to get an intro from the PA and she just

467
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.820
closes the door behind me.
Now I'm standing there,

468
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.140
it's me,
this other dude,
it bill Cosby,

469
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:30.120
who the other two was sitting down and I'm standing up.
It caused me,

470
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.240
looks up at me and he just goes,

471
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:38.550
who are you and me and my heart is pounding.
I'm like,

472
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.200
uh,
um,
um,
Bill Burnham,
um,
I'm a standup comedian.
Any,

473
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.640
any interrupts?
He just goes,
and why are you here?

474
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.200
And I'll go like,
oh my God,
this is the fucking nightmare.

475
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.860
I did want to come up here.
I didn't want to bug them.
I was tongue tied.

476
00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:01.280
I had I,
there was nothing.
I,
I,
what am I going to say?
Why?

477
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.970
Why am I here?
I don't know why I'm here.

478
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.060
I didn't ask to come up here and she just fucking dragged me.

479
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:10.950
So it's three excruciating seconds
after he said,

480
00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:12.930
and why are you here?

481
00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.980
And I'm just sitting there with my jaw on the ground and then he finally lets me

482
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:18.510
off the hook and he goes,

483
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.380
you are here because I asked you to be,

484
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.060
and then emotions to a chair and goes,
sit down.
So I sit down.

485
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:30.670
He had no idea who I was.
I think he knew that I was a comedian,
but I,

486
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:36.400
I sat down and immediately I just had this fucking ear to ear grin on my face

487
00:29:37.201 --> 00:29:40.740
that I couldn't wipe away.
And I just,
as I was sitting down,
I was like,

488
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:41.950
I got to tell you this is like

489
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.180
<v 1>meeting the pope.
And he goes,
yes,
but way more entertaining.</v>

490
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.200
I can't do it the way he did.

491
00:29:47.201 --> 00:29:52.201
He just had me laughing and he proceeded to just start talking to me about how

492
00:29:52.651 --> 00:29:57.651
excited he was about as new special and about the way that he shot the thing.

493
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.930
And,
and,
and uh,
the artistic way.
He's like,

494
00:30:05.931 --> 00:30:10.520
you have to see this thing.
And he was saying,
there's no crowd shots.
He goes,

495
00:30:10.521 --> 00:30:15.230
I don't want the camera on my crowd.
He goes,
leave my people alone.

496
00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.430
Let them laugh if they think it's funny,
he goes,
I don't want the camera on them.

497
00:30:19.431 --> 00:30:23.270
And then they get self conscious and they feel like they have to and he
imitates,

498
00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:28.040
they laugh and he does that.
Cause Bihar did that thing.
It was insane.

499
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.010
So then he goes,
he goes,
I'm going to tell you something about shooting special.

500
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.980
And they look to the other guy goes,
I don't think I should tell him this.

501
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:38.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

502
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.100
<v 1>You know what?
I'm going to tell it.
I'm going to,
I'm going to tell it to him.</v>

503
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.960
And he turns to talk to me.

504
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.590
And right then the door opens and the PA comes back and goes,
Mr Cosby,

505
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:51.210
are you ready?
And he goes,
Oh yes,
of course.
And he stands up and he walks out.

506
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.930
So I never got to hear that.

507
00:30:57.931 --> 00:31:01.290
That the secret of shooting a special.

508
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

509
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.280
<v 1>From a guy who,
I think,
you know,
I,
I've said this before,</v>

510
00:31:07.281 --> 00:31:11.870
I feel like Richard Pryor live in concert and bill Cosby himself run the entire

511
00:31:11.871 --> 00:31:12.704
gamut

512
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.373
<v 0>of,</v>

513
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.630
<v 1>it's like too perfect games.</v>

514
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.073
<v 0>MMM.</v>

515
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.070
<v 1>I can't,
I can't explain it.
And it's just one,</v>

516
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:27.990
just absolutely like Cosby's just totally clean.
And then he says,

517
00:31:27.991 --> 00:31:29.910
asshole one time,
but it's totally necessary.

518
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.540
It's just not an ounce of fat in that special just wire to why is it sitting

519
00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:40.420
down killing,
not cursing,
just

520
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.070
like I just,

521
00:31:44.071 --> 00:31:49.071
you couldn't do it any better as far as just a written special all the way to

522
00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:53.580
Pryor live in concert,
which is just like

523
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.980
I don't,
that's just,
I don't know how to describe that style.

524
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:05.580
Just open free going off now like you don't have your bitch but like

525
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.910
those nights when you're just on as a comic and you just tagging every joke in a

526
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:15.480
three minute joke becomes a five minute joke in a five minute joke becomes a 12

527
00:32:15.481 --> 00:32:18.180
minute joke and then the next time you do you use,

528
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.840
you said you're thinking about how he did it the last time.

529
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:25.110
So you're in your head and then your three minute joke that became a five minute

530
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:28.890
joke now becomes a one minute joke and you burn through an hour of material in

531
00:32:28.891 --> 00:32:33.300
17 minutes and just on stage going,
what the fuck happened?
Anyways,

532
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.950
those are the two.
Perfect,
thanks.
So anyway,

533
00:32:34.951 --> 00:32:39.951
so then he goes downstairs and he walks out on stage and sits down.

534
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.490
<v 2>He has like a,
you can't even see it.</v>

535
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:48.200
It's like this clear Mike that I'm almost like,

536
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:50.870
he would be like typing into on a,
on a keyboard.

537
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.390
So it's hands free kind of thing.

538
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.020
And he sits down almost like a catcher and he's just like,

539
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.770
like he's sitting down on a stoop.
It just does like an hour.

540
00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:07.420
Uh,
you know,
he was only doing like those,
a number of comics that were on it.
Um,

541
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:12.870
but he just sits down and like he did 30 years ago when I saw him or whenever

542
00:33:13.031 --> 00:33:16.600
the hell it was.
Yeah,
it was 30 years ago.
Just absolutely

543
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.270
just total commander the crowd.
I've never seen anything like it,

544
00:33:22.271 --> 00:33:26.590
but there was so many people backstage talking and,
and that type of thing that,

545
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.150
um,
I still have to go see that guy live because I hear they said when he did his

546
00:33:31.151 --> 00:33:36.130
special,
he did two shows,
both 90 minutes,
both,

547
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.840
all different material.

548
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.650
And I brought that up to him when I was talking to a real quickly,

549
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.390
I still can't believe I'm,
I'm saying this.
Yeah.

550
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:48.320
When I was talking to bill Cosby and he said,
uh,

551
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.960
and teachers was humble.
He goes,
well,
you know,

552
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:53.750
I've been doing this for like 50 years.

553
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.400
I should have that much material when you think,
and it's just like,
yeah,

554
00:33:58.401 --> 00:34:00.260
but it's,
that's all relevant.
Yeah.

555
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

556
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.460
<v 2>You know,
don't you have any topical stuff that you have to throw at me?</v>

557
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.410
It's just unbelievable.
So,
um,
he's torn,
he's out there.

558
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:11.743
He's,

559
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:12.760
<v 0>yeah,</v>

560
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.310
<v 2>part of a,</v>

561
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:17.890
one of the last ones from a generation that taught the rest of us how to do it.

562
00:34:17.891 --> 00:34:19.240
So if he comes to your town,

563
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.870
I can't recommend it enough to go out and go see that guy.
But,
uh,

564
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:24.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

565
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.850
<v 2>Yeah.
So that was my week.</v>

566
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

567
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.920
<v 2>You know,
that doesn't suck.
Does I?
Don't think so.</v>

568
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.570
Um,
so what else did I do?

569
00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:37.140
Let's talk about some of the Shit I did with the New Jersey's own.
Paul Versey.

570
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.510
You don't,
I'm actually rooting against the giants.
Not because I hate him,

571
00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:40.281
but because Paul verse,

572
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:42.810
he said when they were all winch six that they were going to go on a run.

573
00:34:42.811 --> 00:34:46.710
Remember I said that,
you know,
I got to feel,
you know,
a dig,
dig,
dig.
It turns,

574
00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.790
you know,
so I,
it's not that I don't want to see the giants go on a run.

575
00:34:50.791 --> 00:34:51.241
It's just,

576
00:34:51.241 --> 00:34:56.241
I don't want to listen to Paul tell me that he called it for the next six years.

577
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.340
Okay.
The fact that he's still talking about Cano and all that,

578
00:35:02.341 --> 00:35:04.530
I don't need another thing him going like,
oh,

579
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.490
like when we're both like when I'm 60 and he's 50 I don't want to be listening

580
00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:11.840
to him talking about the 2013 regular fucking season.
Yeah.

581
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.150
That they could go on a run and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

582
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:20.710
And also just having watched the giant,
you know,

583
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:22.480
<v 0>okay.</v>

584
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.400
<v 2>Win Against the Patriots in the Superbowl twice when the Patriots had them and</v>

585
00:35:27.401 --> 00:35:29.770
they let them off the hook.
Now I'm not taking away from the giants.

586
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.510
The giants still had to fucking deliver.

587
00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:35.290
And Jesus Christ did they and they all stepped up and they all made a play where

588
00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:38.000
we didn't,
we're satay Samuels dropped

589
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.620
<v 1>the fucking interception,
you know,</v>

590
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:44.760
and we Brady to Welker six yards fucking completion that would've gone for first

591
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:47.670
down in the game is over and you leave the door open for them.

592
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.990
They are just a blessed team.
The fact that you can go oh and six

593
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:58.220
okay and then when your next two games and only be two games out and his 16 game

594
00:35:58.711 --> 00:36:03.711
season they have a horse shoe buried so far up their fucking ass.

595
00:36:04.051 --> 00:36:05.160
Like they literally,

596
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:10.190
they could actually win their division starting Oh and six starting Oh and six

597
00:36:10.741 --> 00:36:14.490
as a football team is basically,

598
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:19.550
that would be like losing your first 50 games as a baseball team go and like Oh

599
00:36:20.291 --> 00:36:24.990
and 50 okay.
Cause what all and aid is half the season so oh insects.

600
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.060
I can't,
I'm not doing the math.
I can't even do the map.

601
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:30.780
We'll say that's 40% of the season.
There's 162 games.

602
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.070
<v 0>Yeah</v>

603
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.410
<v 1>that's 40 loggers go 40 and 40 as well.</v>

604
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:38.550
That's like losing your first 70 Ah,
gee,
I don't fucking know.

605
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:40.800
It's like losing a bunch of fucking games and then somehow,

606
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:45.000
not only do you go on a run,
you like you win your division.

607
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:46.830
<v 0>Okay?</v>

608
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:51.150
<v 1>It's insane.
Wait to the cowboys win last night.
I got to look it up.</v>

609
00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:55.360
I started watching that doctor Jay documentary.
They will play in the saints.

610
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:59.220
I'm going to guess no saints at home.
Let's see.

611
00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:03.930
Cowboys,
saints,
this is entertaining,
right?
Listening to some Douche bag.

612
00:37:03.931 --> 00:37:07.020
Look up a score and I'm going to say the saints won.

613
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:13.480
Jesus.
Did they ever 49 17 what?
The fucks and now they're five and five.

614
00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.850
Now fuck this.
I gotta look it up dude.
This is fucking hilarious.

615
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:24.390
And FFL this little gimme an nfl.com official websites standings.

616
00:37:26.531 --> 00:37:29.500
Here we go.
Standings.
What are they?
A game up now?

617
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.533
<v 0>Okay,</v>

618
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.230
<v 1>the giants are three and six,</v>

619
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:42.080
so that did did two out that you can expect is fucking hilarious.

620
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.980
They're actually tied with the Redskins.
The Washington Redskins.

621
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.550
You want to be a shady yourself?
You want to be ashamed of yourself.

622
00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.260
Jesus Christ.
They went,

623
00:37:57.261 --> 00:38:00.930
oh and six,
the giants went oh and six,

624
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:04.290
and it only took them nine games to catch you.
Oh Wow.
That's suppressing.

625
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:09.130
We're already nine games into this fucking season.
Fuck.

626
00:38:09.131 --> 00:38:11.890
It just doesn't,
it just goes by too fast.
It's already November.

627
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.141
Unbelievable.

628
00:38:14.141 --> 00:38:17.380
But thank God there's hockey and I'm actually kind of ended the end of the NBA

629
00:38:17.381 --> 00:38:22.260
this year.
Um,
I don't know,
but it's,
it's very hard to,

630
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.620
to stay up on both those leaks because there's so many games and they played

631
00:38:25.621 --> 00:38:28.410
like deck.
Their seasons just completely overlap each other.

632
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.190
Have you noticed that there's baseball,
football,
like people are either baseball,

633
00:38:32.191 --> 00:38:34.740
football,
basketball or baseball,
football,
hockey.

634
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.850
<v 2>Um,
you know,
if you're going to go,</v>

635
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:40.810
if you're going to try to watch as much as you can,

636
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.070
and then you throw in the golf and you've got to watch Wimbledon,
right?

637
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:46.451
I mean,

638
00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:51.451
no wonder the years are flying by and your wife has that angry look on her face.

639
00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.690
It's just fly.
Oh,
another one you guys got to watch.

640
00:38:55.691 --> 00:39:00.370
Watch the PAT Summerall documentary,
a football life on Pat.

641
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:04.570
Summerall that's another one.
Just,
uh,
just amazing.

642
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.350
You know,
and made me feel good about my drinking considering the way they,

643
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.320
people used to go back in the day.
Um,

644
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.040
<v 4>yeah,</v>

645
00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.450
<v 2>dude,
the dead last Superbowl.</v>

646
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.930
I forget the guy who goes before my time that pat Summerall was paired up with

647
00:39:18.931 --> 00:39:21.510
before John Madden.
Um,

648
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.560
it was just like an open joke that they used to go out boozing,

649
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:31.170
like kind of like an a dean Martin kind of way.
See Pat Summerall.

650
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.673
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

651
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.620
<v 2>Uh,
broadcast team.
Broadcast partner.
There we go.</v>

652
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.670
Let's see if I can find it.

653
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:48.780
Oh,
Tom Brooke shy?
Or was that the guy's name?
Yeah,

654
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:53.790
I think it was Tom Brookshires.
And they actually,
before Superbowl 13,

655
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.270
the second time,
the cowboys and the Steelers met up.

656
00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:02.640
They came on the air in both look like shit and talked about how they'd been

657
00:40:02.641 --> 00:40:06.450
there since Tuesday.
The game was on Sunday or something.

658
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:07.980
Have they been there since Tuesday?

659
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:11.790
And how they felt like they had been there for there for nine years and we're

660
00:40:11.791 --> 00:40:15.900
just basically openly admitting that they were fucking hung over and felt like

661
00:40:15.901 --> 00:40:20.310
shit.
It was insane.
So those,
those are two documentaries to watch.

662
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.960
Um,
oh,
by the way,
had a great,

663
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.500
great fucking time when I was in Philly.
Um,

664
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.960
whenever I drive to Philly down from New York,

665
00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:34.440
by the time I get into Philadelphia,
I absolutely fucking hate the city.

666
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.730
I just hate the fact that you just can't seem to get off the Goddamn Jersey

667
00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:39.564
turnpike

668
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.190
<v 1>you got to,
I always take that exit five.
I always take the wrong one.</v>

669
00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:49.191
I got a weave my way through like 12 suburban towns going by a goddamned gazebo

670
00:40:49.891 --> 00:40:53.910
to go to a major city.
It's a major city.
He got four major fucking teams.

671
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.630
I don't understand why they don't have some fucking throughway where I can

672
00:40:57.631 --> 00:41:01.770
continue to drive 70 miles an hour and get to Philly in no time whatsoever.

673
00:41:01.771 --> 00:41:03.720
I know I'm taking the wrong one.
I should take that one.

674
00:41:03.721 --> 00:41:07.280
That's the 30 that you go over the Ben Franklin Bridge.
But I went over that.

675
00:41:07.281 --> 00:41:11.350
That other one,
exit five.
We end up going over like that fucking foot bridge.

676
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.813
<v 2>MMM.</v>

677
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.040
<v 1>Can you pissed and you get there and it's like 12 one ways and going in the same</v>

678
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:20.110
direction.
Then another one going the other way and you're like,

679
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:23.260
my hotels right fucking there.
How do I get to it?
And you're pissed.

680
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:26.140
But then you see Mitchell and ness and all the great food in and you're walking

681
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:28.850
around,
you have a great time.
So anyways,
uh,

682
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:33.290
we went and we did the shows at the tower theater.
Crowds were awesome.

683
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.670
No,
I'm just fucking awesome.
And um,
oh,
and you know,

684
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:40.100
it was awesome too with some woman came to my team,

685
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:43.400
came to the first show and as I was walking off stage,

686
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:49.450
like handed me a loaf of Pumpkin bread because I uh,

687
00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:51.580
<v 5>yeah,</v>

688
00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.280
<v 1>I mentioned,
I was talking shit about how good my pumpkin bread was.</v>

689
00:41:54.281 --> 00:41:59.281
So she hands me this loaf of Pumpkin bread as I'm getting off stage and I'm

690
00:41:59.921 --> 00:42:01.900
laughing like,
like,

691
00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.990
cause I know why she gave it to me and I'm walking upstairs and she has it

692
00:42:04.991 --> 00:42:06.250
wrapped very professionally.

693
00:42:06.251 --> 00:42:10.180
Like she has cellophane around it and then she has this plastic bag over that

694
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:14.500
with the twisty,
a twist tie.
And now I'm going upstairs and I walked by the guy,

695
00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:18.250
I go,
look,
there's somebody may be some pumpkin bread and you know,

696
00:42:18.251 --> 00:42:21.910
there's no bar code on it.
There's no governmental shit.

697
00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:26.820
This stuff is not gone through any sort of stuff whatsoever.
So I'll live,

698
00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:30.250
I say to the guy backstage,
I go,
do you got an,

699
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:31.780
you got to have a rat problem back here.

700
00:42:31.781 --> 00:42:34.630
Can I feed a piece of this to a rat and just see what happens to the rat?

701
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.880
They'll look a little food testing before I biked to this,

702
00:42:36.881 --> 00:42:39.120
make sure there's no weed in it or any shit like that.

703
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.750
<v 5>And um,</v>

704
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.700
<v 1>and whatever.
So I went upstairs and I was just like,
I gotta try it.
And,
uh,</v>

705
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:51.350
it helped.
The person who made it is,
is listening.
It was fucking outstanding.

706
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.880
Outstanding.
Uh,
I'm not gonna say it was better than mine.

707
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.610
It's like saint Cosby's better than prior.

708
00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:03.080
Our pumpkin breads are both coexisting in that stratosphere and it would just

709
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:07.670
really be a,
it would just be a mess,
a personal,

710
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.430
personal preference.
I got to tell you,
um,

711
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.760
whoever made it made it in and hand it to me,
it was outstanding version.

712
00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:19.160
He had some too and was like,
I couldn't throw it out.
Actually,

713
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:20.570
Paul took it home to his family.

714
00:43:20.571 --> 00:43:24.260
So I hope the drugs or whatever you did to what aren't in the middle of it

715
00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:25.400
because he has kids,

716
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.150
but it was fucking delicious.
So thank you very much for that.
Um,

717
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.890
it's very nice of you.
Um,
and speaking of battling,
which is better,

718
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:41.220
my pumpkin bread,
your pumpkin bread.
All right.
You're in Philly.

719
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.510
You don't live there.
Or even if you do live there,
how do you end a great night?

720
00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:47.283
<v 5>Come on.</v>

721
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.920
<v 1>You gotta go to Geno's or pats for this fucking steak and cheeses,
right?</v>

722
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.750
And I'm sure the people in oh,
football goes,
please.
Jill felt fucking tours drab.

723
00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.110
You go to uncle fuckees over here,
but whatever,
for an out of town guy,

724
00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:05.030
that's what I did.
So I go down there and first he's going,
so what should we do?

725
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:09.380
Should do Pat's or Geno's?
And I'm like,
well,
fuck it.
Why don't we go,
uh,

726
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.760
we'll get one of each,
then we'll cut them in half and we'll,
you know,

727
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.230
trade mix and match,
do a little surf and turf and see which one we like better.

728
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.821
So of course we go,
what?

729
00:44:19.821 --> 00:44:24.821
We got to Pat's first and we order it and it's just one giant fucking steak and

730
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:28.160
cheese sub and they don't have even have a plastic knife fee to cut it up.

731
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:32.340
All they have is a spoon for,
I dunno what do you,
cheese fries or something.

732
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.050
<v 2>Um,
so he's got a tear it in half and I go over to a,</v>

733
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.560
was standing in line at Geno's Amit and half a one of a patch,

734
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.670
right?
I got one whit is what we got and dude,

735
00:44:47.671 --> 00:44:52.620
it was fucking delicious.
Fucking delicious.
So then I go to the,

736
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.670
uh,
Geno's place.
Same deal.

737
00:44:56.671 --> 00:45:01.150
We ordered another one and as I go up there,
I know I,

738
00:45:01.151 --> 00:45:02.130
I'd been there before,

739
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:06.390
but I never noticed the sign there on Geno's where it says,

740
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.380
uh,
he's got two signs.
One says I'm mad as hell.

741
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:15.270
I want my country back.
And it's a picture of the,

742
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:17.610
uh,
the original owner.
I'd really don't want to fuck this up.

743
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:22.611
Joey Vento and is a picture of him basically on with the picture of just the

744
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:28.770
lower 48.
And I love how he blows off Alaska and Hawaii.

745
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.630
He wants his country back.

746
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.030
And then below that there's a picture that says,

747
00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:38.420
uh,
uh,

748
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.540
this is America when ordering speak English.

749
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.540
And I was just like,
Jesus Christ,
man,

750
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:50.541
that's like some old school Bronx tale Archie bunker shit.

751
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.650
And
I saw it and I was like,

752
00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:00.000
it was funny to me because there was this table like five Latino people standing

753
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:04.830
around speaking Spanish or whatever,
eating the food.
And I'm like wow,

754
00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:07.740
that is a testament to how good your fucking food is,

755
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.330
where you could just like openly insult somebody like that.

756
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:15.630
And um,
well I guess they spoke English shoe cause they did order,

757
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:16.411
I had a fucking,
no,

758
00:46:16.411 --> 00:46:20.340
I'm just saying that your food is so good that you could be like consulting that

759
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:24.210
much openly insulting and uh,
people still order it.

760
00:46:24.211 --> 00:46:29.211
So I looked it up and there's this whole thing where this Guy Joey Ventosa son,

761
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:33.223
um,
um,

762
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:37.830
Joey Vento passed away and his son took over the business and I guess it was

763
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:42.360
this guy's dying.
Wish to keep the speak English sign of Geno's still up there.

764
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.630
I'll read you the article real quickly here.
Uh,

765
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.900
it said last week,
uh,

766
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:54.570
eatery Philly ran a photo of rapper Busta rhymes hanging out at Geno's steaks

767
00:46:54.571 --> 00:46:57.090
and south Philly.
This was all well and good,

768
00:46:57.091 --> 00:47:00.810
but what really caught our interest was an update to the item explaining that

769
00:47:00.811 --> 00:47:04.770
the speak English sign is still being proudly displayed at Geno's because it

770
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:09.390
preserves pres.
Its preservation was what late owner Joe event.

771
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.720
Jesus Christ,
I'm sorry guys,
because it's preservation was late owner Joey Vento,

772
00:47:13.721 --> 00:47:14.221
his dying.

773
00:47:14.221 --> 00:47:18.750
Wish Gino recently retained Neff associates,

774
00:47:18.751 --> 00:47:21.630
the same public relation firm that began handling the Joe's.

775
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.390
Oh yeah,
the Joe's verse.
Chinks,
racist cheese steak drama.

776
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.040
Oh,
this is a PR firm.

777
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.290
<v 1>NEFF PR director.</v>

778
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:36.280
Cow Flood explains the geno science situation in an email today.

779
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:38.590
Uh,
he says,
as you know,

780
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:43.120
Geno's is under new management since the passing of Joy Vento,
Gino Vento,

781
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:46.570
Joey's openly gay son is the new owner and operator.

782
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.750
And I think it's important to inform you that he does not share all of the

783
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:52.270
polarizing views his father was famous for.

784
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.040
I think it's also important for you to know that we ever attained,
uh,

785
00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:00.410
Joe steaks,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

786
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:04.660
whatever.
I guess it was this guy's dying wishes.

787
00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.420
Dad's dying wish was to keep it up there.
So it son sort of caught in the middle.

788
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.253
<v 5>MMM,</v>

789
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:12.740
<v 1>I dunno.
It's actually an intro,</v>

790
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:16.570
almost like an interesting piece of history where they have like colored

791
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:19.390
bathroom only.
We just kind of see

792
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:25.480
how far we've come yet.
Haven't come that far.
I don't know.
It was,
it was pretty,

793
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:29.470
it takes a lot to kind of shock me.
I was just like,

794
00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.700
Jesus Christ.
And then I felt like,
well,
fuck this place.
I don't want to eat here.

795
00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.680
I'll just eat at the other place.
And um,
I just heard,

796
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:42.550
well that's owned by the same family.
I don't know.
For the record.

797
00:48:42.551 --> 00:48:45.020
I like Pat's better on that night.
So I,

798
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.080
it might be one of those nights where any given night there,

799
00:48:47.081 --> 00:48:50.410
but they're both absolutely delicious.
So then I had to look up this,

800
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.860
the Joe's verse,
Chinks,
racist cheese,
steak drama.

801
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:59.470
So,
uh,
I look up this one.
By the way,

802
00:48:59.471 --> 00:49:03.700
all of this shit is making me feel much better about being from the Boston area

803
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:07.630
because we seem to get like other than the south,

804
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:09.820
like when you talk about racist cities in the north,

805
00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:14.821
people always talk about Boston and I guess there was a place that's now called

806
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.930
like Joe's stakes and whatever.

807
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:18.633
<v 5>MMM.</v>

808
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.960
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
Where the fuck is the thing?</v>

809
00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:24.440
<v 5>What is the article here?</v>

810
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.230
<v 1>Okay.
Philly is renaming a cheese steak shop that used to be called chinks.</v>

811
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.250
<v 5>Um,
all right.</v>

812
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.360
<v 1>Philadelphia Capitol City of the United States is,
uh,
is great at many things.</v>

813
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:41.120
It's great at being within a relatively short drive [inaudible] to de

814
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.550
unfortunately two topics.

815
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:46.930
It is yet to master our race relations and nuance.

816
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.400
Um,
which is why its residents are freaking out.

817
00:49:51.401 --> 00:49:56.401
That a Philly cheese steak shop known since 1949 as chinks steaks has just

818
00:49:57.671 --> 00:50:01.000
changed its name to Joe's steaks and soda shop.

819
00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:06.590
A chinks was names for its original owner whose name wasn't Cenk,

820
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:13.840
but who boy did he look like,
one according to his grade school classmates.

821
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:18.970
Um,
the Philadelphia Inquirer notes that the late Samuel Chink Sherman,

822
00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:22.240
so some guy named Sam Chairman had almond shaped eyes,

823
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.640
so everybody called him chink.
Uh,

824
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:29.090
folks in the shops neighborhood understand why someone somewhere at some point

825
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.900
maybe could be,
could find the well known racial slur inappropriate,

826
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.920
but they stopped just short of admitting that it actually is.

827
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.380
And because nothing flavors meet like a couple of decades of racism.

828
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.930
They pee,
they're pissed that shakes no longer exist.
Um,

829
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:53.270
here's a sampling of some of the best lines of complaints.
Uh,
back then,

830
00:50:53.271 --> 00:50:57.560
ethnic slurs slipped off the tongue as smoothly as melted.
American cheese.

831
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:02.120
Cracker barrel hasn't had to change their name.
I mean,

832
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.610
that could be made into a racist thing.

833
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:06.973
<v 5>MMM.</v>

834
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.580
<v 1>Others said the passing of chinks symbolized the neighborhood's decline.</v>

835
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.380
Uh,
if the shop had been named with a slur against blacks,

836
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:20.950
that would be offensive.
Said Tarell Jenkins,

837
00:51:20.951 --> 00:51:25.420
a 44 year old African American man,
but Chink,

838
00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:29.500
Chink was a nickname.
It could have been a term of endearment.

839
00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.100
See,
that's the one thing that I've learned about travel.

840
00:51:36.101 --> 00:51:38.410
It's just people just give a shit about themselves.

841
00:51:38.411 --> 00:51:42.250
So there's an African American guy,
thank you.
Had empathy.
He doesn't give a fuck.

842
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.070
It's not coming in his direction.
It's like Eh,

843
00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.520
you know good about a term of endearment.
Sounds like a white dude at that point.

844
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.330
You know what that reminds me of?
That reminds me of a,

845
00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:54.760
back in the day one of those,
you know,
England,

846
00:51:54.761 --> 00:51:58.900
they have that stupid royalty and these kings and queens and Dutches and dukes

847
00:51:58.901 --> 00:52:01.150
and like just all his pomp and circumstance.

848
00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.800
I guess they don't make any decisions over there,

849
00:52:02.801 --> 00:52:05.770
but God knows I haven't really run read up on it.
So what the fuck do I know?

850
00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:06.761
But anyways,

851
00:52:06.761 --> 00:52:10.870
they had some sort of Polo club over there and there was some Middle Eastern guy

852
00:52:10.871 --> 00:52:13.630
who was a member and I think he was one of the only Middle Eastern guys.

853
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:17.650
Everybody else was these,
you know,
blue blood guys at all,
you know,

854
00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:19.120
then assessed you was fucking silly,

855
00:52:19.121 --> 00:52:22.840
all have weird ears and fucked up looking faces like Prince Charles,
you know.

856
00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:24.940
And um,

857
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:31.390
their nickname for him was study.
They call them study.

858
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.200
So that got out and the Pakistanian Guy,
whatever the hell his name,

859
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:39.370
whatever ethnicity he was,
he said like,
oh no,
it was a term of endearment.

860
00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:42.010
I don't mind.
I just love like,

861
00:52:42.011 --> 00:52:47.011
that's such like a blue blood Rothchild level,

862
00:52:48.851 --> 00:52:53.390
like study,
you know,
like the,

863
00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.480
from your chimney,
from the giant fireplace in your fucking manner.

864
00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.750
You know,
nobody thinks about it anymore.
First of all,

865
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.850
most houses don't even have fireplaces anymore.

866
00:53:03.851 --> 00:53:07.000
You can't even use them unless you buy an old one that's grandfathered in.

867
00:53:07.001 --> 00:53:10.300
He know them.
They had these old fucking whatever,

868
00:53:10.301 --> 00:53:13.480
whatever the next style house up from a manner is,
you know,

869
00:53:13.481 --> 00:53:18.010
that one that they shoot it from the air and it looks like a public library

870
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.230
except the grounds is so fucking gorgeous.

871
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:26.670
All the hedge rows to quote led Zepplin if there's something in your hedge row.

872
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.040
Um,
so anyways,
so I was just fascinating for me to read this like

873
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.830
<v 3>okay.</v>

874
00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:34.401
<v 1>I Dunno,
it just,</v>

875
00:53:34.401 --> 00:53:39.401
it just reminded me this was like 1950s level sort of racism like,

876
00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:44.630
uh,
like they're reading just shit and kind of being in that environment.

877
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:49.520
I was surprised that there weren't some people with their hair grease back

878
00:53:49.521 --> 00:53:53.810
standing around like burning trashcan singing Doo wop

879
00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.250
had a very Bronx tale sort of vibe to it.
So,
um,

880
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.300
but having said that,
those racist sons of bitches make some great food.

881
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:09.350
They really do.
And uh,
I've only eight there one time,

882
00:54:09.351 --> 00:54:12.770
so I'm not going to pass judgment other than to say my experience that night,

883
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.910
pat,
Pat's got the leg up.
All right.

884
00:54:16.911 --> 00:54:20.360
But that's a divisional rivalry.
So they play each other twice in one season.

885
00:54:20.361 --> 00:54:22.520
So I got to go back and have another game down there.

886
00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.990
It was fucking delicious and I don't regret a second of putting that poison into

887
00:54:26.991 --> 00:54:29.240
my body.
The fucking bread was delicious.

888
00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:32.720
The cheese was all of that toxic,

889
00:54:32.721 --> 00:54:37.010
horrific shit that my body is probably still trying to process and decide where

890
00:54:37.011 --> 00:54:41.360
it should put it in my body.
Um,
I'm telling you right now,

891
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:44.030
I would do it again tonight and I just had it two nights ago.

892
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.590
It was fucking delicious.
So thumbs up on the cuisine,

893
00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.790
thumbs down on the ignorant thought,
but uh,

894
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.130
leaving the sign up.

895
00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:56.640
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

896
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.660
<v 1>Um,
I definitely think the name of the place,
if it's racist it,</v>

897
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.960
you should get rid of it.
But there was something about leaving the signup that,

898
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.853
um,

899
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.540
<v 3>okay.</v>

900
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.510
<v 1>I Dunno if,
to me I looked at more as like a museum.</v>

901
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:14.100
Like this was the guy and he was beloved in the neighborhood,

902
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:15.780
yet he thought this way.
He had another,

903
00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:18.150
he had another sign that they actually took down.

904
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:21.210
It said Real Americans don't press number two,

905
00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:26.400
which was a reference to,
you know,
if you'd like English,
press one.

906
00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

907
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:32.140
<v 1>At Primo Numero dos.
You know,
there's always the,
the fucking,
uh,</v>

908
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.770
pretty my whatever the fuck they say,
uh,
is the Spanish.

909
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:40.990
That one to me was actually funny.
I don't condone it or whatever,

910
00:55:40.991 --> 00:55:44.380
but it was at least,
it was least clever sort of racism.

911
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.030
I just loved that whole philosophy,
you know?

912
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:50.470
Gimme I want my country back and that's the same fucking guy that if a native

913
00:55:50.471 --> 00:55:54.910
American came up,
you know,
instead I want my country back.

914
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:59.080
Like,
you know,
this guy would immediately go into some sort of,
I would imagine,

915
00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.400
I don't wanna put words in his mouth,

916
00:56:00.401 --> 00:56:05.401
but I imagine he would go on on some sort of fucking rant about how native

917
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.720
Americans were savages,
you know?

918
00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

919
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:12.990
<v 1>As we systematically fucking wiped them out,
like a bunch of fucking savages.</v>

920
00:56:12.991 --> 00:56:15.840
So whatever,
it was really interesting and it was delicious food.
Okay,
let's,

921
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:19.570
let's get to some,
uh,
let's get some,
some,
uh,

922
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.860
some more advertising and then I got to get to the questions over there.

923
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:28.750
All right,
here we go.
Let's see if I can improve on to screw ups,

924
00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:33.400
legal zoom,
everybody.
There are two reasons,
not one,

925
00:56:33.401 --> 00:56:36.970
but two reasons why now is the perfect time to start your own business.

926
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:40.990
Reason number one,
the economy is picking up and the longer you wait,

927
00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:45.850
the longer you delay your potential success.
Reason number two,
right now you can.

928

You can incorporate your business or form an llc@legalzoom.com for just $99

929

legal zooms online process guides you step by step and you get total customer

930
00:56:58.121 --> 00:56:59.800
support.
It couldn't be much easier.

931
00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.600
Legal zoom pro provides self-help services that your specific direction and kick

932
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:06.010
connect you to an attorney,

933
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:10.780
but they are not a law firm so you have a pile of money now so you save a pile

934
00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:15.010
of money.
That's for strokes against me.
Get an extra discount and you went to,

935
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:19.650

I went into the water.

936
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:24.940
Don't wait on the sidelines while others are taking charge of their futures.

937
00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:28.120
Now is the best time to get in the game and launch your business.

938
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:33.160
Don't put this off for incorporation,
trademarks,

941
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:47.860
Good Lord.
That was like the shark when he blew the masters.
That was terrible.

942
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.970
It legal zoom doesn't pay me this week.
I understand.
All right,

943
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:53.680
let's see if I can go nick Faldo on this one.

944
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:59.550
stamps.com everyone postage meter companies used to have the monopoly on

945
00:58:00.341 --> 00:58:01.300
printing postage.

946
00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:05.020
They could charge you an arm and a leg to print postage from your own office,

947
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:06.730
but those days are over.

Vista print everyone.

966
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:22.070
A business card says a lot about you and your business.

967
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:26.570
Are you a hardworking landscaper,
a hip and funky salon owner,

968
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.370
a loyal dog,

970
00:59:37.341 --> 00:59:40.040

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.520
Get 250 of their premium cards for only 10 bucks.

The shipping is on them too.

973
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:49.760
I created my cards the other day and I have to say I was impressed at how easy

974
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:53.240
it was.
First,
you choose to design,
you want pick your industry.

975
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:57.770
There are over 20 or you select a style instead,
like bold,
conservative,
modern,

976
00:59:57.771 --> 00:59:59.420
or retro,
whatever you want.
They got it.

977
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:03.110
They even have a personal and family section.

978
01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:06.380
If you're looking to create a contact on mommy card,

979
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.910
vista print has so many designs to choose from that you're bound to find one

980
01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:13.280
that says exactly what you want,
just the way you want.

981
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.770
I even stumbled across a Henna Tattoo card.

982
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.840
These guys really think of everything.
Once you find a car,

983
01:00:19.841 --> 01:00:24.841
do you like the design process itself is super easy and fun at text photos or

984
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:27.890
logos.
You can even change colors,
fonts,
and move things around.

985
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:30.260
You can be an artist,
so again,

986
01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:33.770
that's 250 high quality premium cards with shipping included.

Just go to www.vista print.com.

989
01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:45.890
It put it in the promotional code bur bur are,
as you check out,

990
01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:49.370
make sure you take a look at the other marketing products they offer.

991
01:00:49.371 --> 01:00:53.120

U.
R.
R.

997
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

998
01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.960
<v 1>Wow.
That was brutal.
I just really went off the rails.
Um,
okay.</v>

999
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.980
Let's close that forever.
Don't need to see that.
Okay.
On to the questions.

1000
01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:27.570
Answer the question.
Um,
all right.
Oh,

1001
01:01:27.571 --> 01:01:31.560
by the way,
for all you Alabama fans,
congratulations.
You fucking assholes.

1002
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.820
That really devastated me.
Uh,
we had you.

1003
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:38.400
I really think if we scored that first touchdown,

1004
01:01:38.401 --> 01:01:42.640
it would've been a different thing.
You've got to protect the fucking ball.

1005
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:44.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1006
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.610
<v 1>You know,
and then all of it's done.</v>

1007
01:01:45.611 --> 01:01:48.370
They just keep the discipline just went out the window and they'll completely

1008
01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.240
went off the rails.

1009
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:50.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1010
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:50.943
<v 1>You know,</v>

1011
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:56.110
and I just have to say Nick Saban just completely outclassed the way he's

1012
01:01:56.410 --> 01:02:00.790
players played and all that and it's absolutely devastating.
You fucking conch.

1013
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:05.740
All right there.
You happy?
Okay.
Should I say yes bill?

1014
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.940
I have a 16 year old virgin guy from Texas and really want to go balls deep in a

1015
01:02:09.941 --> 01:02:12.590
snatch before college.
Jesus Christ.

1016
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.660
He'll rub one out before you text me next time or email me.
Um,

1017
01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:20.730
home company is in a week and this girl who I talked a lot last year,

1018
01:02:20.731 --> 01:02:24.120
it doesn't have a date because her date didn't want to pay the 150 bucks.

1019
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:28.050
All right.
You got yourself a wounded bird.
Things are looking good so far.

1020
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:34.080
Uh,
when this year started we ha we haven't talked and I've never texted her.

1021
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.770
I don't know where she texted me.
I didn't even have her number immediately.

1022
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:42.210
I knew it was going to be about homecoming because it was all about people.

1023
01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:45.510
We were talking about,
uh,
that we,
we,
oh fuck.

1024
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.590
Because it was all people we were talking about that week.

1025
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.320
She asked me to go with,
she asked me to go with her,

1026
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:57.450
but in a way that made me think she was using me so that she doesn't go alone.

1027
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.680
Yeah.
There is a bit of that.
She's definitely desperate.
You know,

1028
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.100
you kind of like the third string quarterback and they both went down to the

1029
01:03:06.101 --> 01:03:08.850
stick and you in there,
so I know what you're saying.

1030
01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.270
Is she going to let me throw the deep ball or am I just going to have to go in

1031
01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:15.540
there and take a fucking knee?
Right.
Are handed off,

1032
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.650
go in the I formation or the wish bump.
Anyways,

1033
01:03:19.651 --> 01:03:22.800
he said there's a pretty good chance I would get laid if I win.

1034
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.800
I told her I think that I would think about it.

1035
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.760
Then she offered to pay for the mum and the food.

1036
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:33.180
What is the mum?
Does she really want to go with me?

1037
01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:37.440
Should I say yes and the host hopes that I get to slam her cunt.

1038
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.470
You know,
dude,
I really can't figure you out.

1039
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:44.970
It's like you're acting like a virgin by not saying yes to this layup and then

1040
01:03:44.971 --> 01:03:47.130
you just really talking about her

1041
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.540
in a really disrespectful way.
This girl is an angel.
All right?

1042
01:03:53.541 --> 01:03:58.190
The fact that she's going to give it up to a fucking 16 year old virgin show,

1043
01:03:58.191 --> 01:04:00.290
a little bird respect,
but you might be also,

1044
01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:02.810
this might be your insecurity that you are a virgin,

1045
01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:06.980
so you're trying to talk really aggressively about something that you might have

1046
01:04:06.981 --> 01:04:10.670
a little bit of fear about.
I have no idea.
Look,
this is what you should do.

1047
01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:14.360
If you're going to go with this girl,
be a fucking sweetheart.
All right?

1048
01:04:14.361 --> 01:04:15.194
Make her laugh.

1049
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:18.620
Fucking dance around the dance floor and have a great God damn time.

1050
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.810
And if the opportunity presents itself,
have it all right,

1051
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:26.960
but that's how you go into it.
I mean,
she's already paying for it.

1052
01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:29.480
What kind of a fucking man?
I mean,
I guess you're a pimp at this point.

1053
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:34.430
I'm a pimp.
Virgin.
You don't see that very often.
Whatever you're doing,

1054
01:04:34.431 --> 01:04:37.400
it seems to be working,
but I just have a little more respect for it.

1055
01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:40.880
That's all I'm saying.
All right.
Go in there.
Have a good time.
All right.

1056
01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.520
What's that?
What does that,

1057
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.340
what's that John Med speech that Joe Barton always quotes tonight.

1058
01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.480
Today will be the greatest day your life,
but only if you win.

1059
01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.630
So good luck man.
I hope you,
I hope you win.
All right,
there you go.

1060
01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.610
But be respectful.
God dammit.
All right.
Car purchase process.

1061
01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.250
Hey there,
Bill.
Mick red,
beard in balls.
MIC,
red beard and balls.

1062
01:05:09.251 --> 01:05:11.980
I liked that.
It's kind of like a law firm.
Um,

1063
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.440
love the podcast and love the standup.
Have tickets to see you in DC.
Well,

1064
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:18.130
I hope you enjoyed

1065
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:21.220
<v 2>the show.
I had a,
I had a phenomenal time.
Um,
he said,</v>

1066
01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:25.600
my question is about your car purchase process.
When you bought your Prius,

1067
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.910
did you do it in salon?

1068
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:31.780
Did you do it celebrity style and send one of your cronies with a scrooge McDuck

1069
01:05:31.781 --> 01:05:35.980
style money bag over
oh to the dealership.

1070
01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:38.560
Then have it delivered to your place or did you go in old,

1071
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.970
old school and negotiate face to face where you one of those assholes who bicker

1072
01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:43.930
over a hundred dollars?

1073
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:48.160
Or did you just buy the whole Shebang and make some poor SAP sales guys day?

1074
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.160
I asked because I've been selling cars for 10 years.

1075
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:55.210
I find that the people who dicker over the smallest amount of money are usually

1076
01:05:55.211 --> 01:05:58.030
the most miserable considering and after the sale.

1077
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.640
While the people who pay the most of the happiest customers,
uh,

1078
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:05.260
I'm happiest customers I have and send me all their friends and family,

1079
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:10.780
a fellow ginger and sleazy car salesman.
Um,
all right.

1080
01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:15.310
See you own up to it that you're robbing those people.
I tried to,

1081
01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:19.660
uh,
I tried to haggle over the price and uh,

1082
01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:24.400
I was buying the Prius when gas prices were like forced for something,

1083
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:27.940
a gallon back in like 2007.

1084
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:32.560
So they couldn't keep those things on the lot.
So I was just like,

1085
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:35.640
this is my offer.
Take it or leave it.
And they're like,
well,

1086
01:06:35.641 --> 01:06:39.550
we're going to leave it.
And I'm like,
I'm walking out.
I'm Outta here.

1087
01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:43.930
And they're like,
all right,
see Ya.
And I needed a car and I was renting one.

1088
01:06:43.931 --> 01:06:45.670
That was the thing.
If I had another car,

1089
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.670
if I actually had a car that could drive away with instead of a rental that was

1090
01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:52.610
costing me money.
So I just said,
all right,
fuck it.
I'll just pay.

1091
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:56.560
I'll just pay it and I'll go do some more standup gigs.
Um,

1092
01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.850
but just personally speaking,
if you can't knock any money off of the car,

1093
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.960
just cause you know that they are fucking you over.
Um,

1094
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:06.933
you know,

1095
01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.720
one of my buddies does it the best and he is also a salesman and he looks down

1096
01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:13.360
on car salesman.
He looks at you guys like,

1097
01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.950
like hack comedians as far as like being salesmen.

1098
01:07:15.951 --> 01:07:19.600
He thinks you're the lowest of the low.
Now listen,
that's not my thought.

1099
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:20.434
That's just his,

1100
01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:26.220
he just calls them up and says the car that he wants and the price that he's

1101
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:30.550
going to pay.
And he says,
I'm calling for other dealerships.

1102
01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:33.850
You have til noon to get back to me,
does it,
something like that.

1103
01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:38.851
And they get back to him and he gets it for the price that he wants because it's

1104
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:43.600
a guaranteed sale.
He's like,
I'm buying a car today and these dealerships,

1105
01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:46.990
they can't resist that.
So I oversimplified it because I don't,

1106
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:51.680
I'm not totally,
um,
you know,

1107
01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:54.780
informed on,
I always forget how it goes down,

1108
01:07:54.781 --> 01:07:58.710
so I can't intelligently present what the fuck it is that he does.

1109
01:07:58.711 --> 01:08:03.120
But that's the way he does it.
Um,
but anyways,
I'm actually,
you know,

1110
01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:06.930
thinking about,
um,
buying Nia a nice car.

1111
01:08:06.931 --> 01:08:11.931
So if any car salesmen out there could give me some tips and present the ins and

1112
01:08:12.991 --> 01:08:15.000
outs about how much they do,
mark cause it,
yeah,

1113
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:17.810
I've heard a lot of stuff like the sales slip on the side of the car,
the car,

1114
01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.430
the price up at the top is what the dealership pays and at the dealership

1115
01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.950
doesn't pay for any of the options and that type of thing,

1116
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:26.480
which doesn't seem right to me.

1117
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:29.750
I feel like they must get a discount on the options.
What is the discount?

1118
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.070
And I also know that they need to make money.
So what's a good,

1119
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.900
let's just say if I'm going to go buy a $30,000 car,
all right?

1120
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:44.100
And if I look at that,
the sheet,
it's,
it came in at 22 or 24,

1121
01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:47.340
just say 24 and it gets six grand worth of fucking options or something like

1122
01:08:47.341 --> 01:08:49.530
that.
I don't,
I don't even know if those numbers make sense.

1123
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:53.210
If you're a car salesman like w w where should I be?

1124
01:08:53.211 --> 01:08:56.390
Should I be in the middle of that?
Should I be at 24?

1125
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.010
Um,
where should I be?
Let me know and I'll read it on to other people.
All right,

1126
01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:08.050
so I guess to answer your question,
um,
I was the guy who just kind of paint,

1127
01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.080
I'm not a miserable [inaudible] as much as I sound like it.

1128
01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:14.830
I'm actually a really,
uh,
I'm a pretty happy guy.
But you know,

1129
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.110
I'm talking about how happy you are on fucking stage.
I mean,

1130
01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:18.190
it's not really going to be funny.

1131
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:22.660
So if I talk about my frustrations and my fears and my shortcomings,
you know?

1132
01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.760
Yeah.
That's where the comedy is.
All right.
There you go.
All right.

1133
01:09:26.761 --> 01:09:31.650
That was a twofer.
Alright.
Human farming,
Billy beer balls.

1134
01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:35.880
Um,
have you heard of the concept of human farming?

1135
01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.270
It really makes a lot of sense.
Instead of primitive forms of slavery,

1136
01:09:39.271 --> 01:09:42.540
the population works and proved and produces for the elite class.

1137
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:46.380
The quality of life is terrible because the ends to the means of working is

1138
01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:49.590
really just to service a higher system.
You have no idea.

1139
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:54.450
You're a part of this video summarizes it really well.
Sleep well.

1140
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.370
So I actually went to go look at this thing,

1141
01:09:56.371 --> 01:10:00.080
this human farming and I understand what they're saying,

1142
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:05.330
but they as always,
you know,
they don't seem to,

1143
01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:08.300
well I didn't watch the whole video,
but it's like in the 13 minutes,

1144
01:10:08.301 --> 01:10:12.750
are they really going to give me a solution?
Um,
and it also,

1145
01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:14.161
first of all,

1146
01:10:14.161 --> 01:10:19.161
the guy narrating it might be the most arrogant cunt I've ever heard in my life.

1147
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:27.900
I can't even,
I'll click on it right now if you want,
you know,
he's just like,

1148
01:10:27.901 --> 01:10:32.670
you know,
a lot of people might be confused.
Hang on,
hang on,
hang on.

1149
01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:36.210
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
I got to get through the Dodge Durango commercial here.

1150
01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:41.130
14 seconds.
He,
you know,
he's basically going like,
you know,

1151
01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:42.540
some people get,

1152
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.530
get confused and look at the government as it's this thing that's helping them

1153
01:10:46.531 --> 01:10:48.600
out,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1154
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.870
Are you beginning to understand the cage that you would put in?

1155
01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:57.170
Listen to this guy and how you can finally be free.

1156
01:10:57.790 --> 01:11:00.250
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Let me,
let me,
let me,

1157
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.370
let me get back to the beginning.
Here we go.

1158
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:05.660
This is the story of your enslavement,

1159
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:11.930
how it came to be and how you can finally be free.

1160
01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:15.941
Like all animals,

1161
01:11:15.941 --> 01:11:20.290
human beings want to dominate and exploit the resources around them.

1162
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.480
<v 1>All right,
so that's the tone this guy takes.</v>

1163
01:11:23.481 --> 01:11:26.840
Let's get a little bit further into this thing.
Here we go.

1164
01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:31.780
<v 2>Patient throughout history and it is now reaching its destructive climax.</v>

1165
01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:39.890
Human society cannot be rationally understood until it is seen for what?

1166
01:11:39.891 --> 01:11:44.891
It is a series of farms where human farmers own human livestock.

1167
01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.030
Some people get confused.

1168
01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.900
<v 1>Shit,
I pulled it away.
Some people get confused.
Here we go.
Listen to this shit,</v>

1169
01:11:56.901 --> 01:11:58.340
listen to this,
and talking down to you.

1170
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:05.160
<v 2>Some people get confused because governments provide healthcare and water and</v>

1171
01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:07.470
education and roads and that's,

1172
01:12:07.471 --> 01:12:10.620
imagine that there is some benevolence at work.

1173
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:15.180
Nothing could be further from the reality.

1174
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:17.670
<v 1>All right,
so then he breaks it down and then in the end he goes,</v>

1175
01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:22.740
are you beginning to understand the cage that you were in?
Me keeps going.

1176
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:26.790
Some people get confused.
It's like,
dude,
I'm not fucking confused.
All right,

1177
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:30.930
you're arrogant cunt.
You sound like you're up your own ass.

1178
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.070
You sound like you're sitting on top of the fucking pyramid.
All right?

1179
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.290
You know what?
This,
this type of shit does that.

1180
01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:39.120
It doesn't take into consideration.

1181
01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.720
It doesn't take into consideration mouth breathing,

1182
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:44.310
fucking morons.

1183
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.340
That whole philosophy that why does this guy have this much and this guy has

1184
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:55.341
this much that it's always the rich guy is evil and manipulative and undeserving

1185
01:12:57.271 --> 01:13:00.240
nine.
Now,
this is shocking to hear for me the way I go off on bankers,

1186
01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:03.720
but I'm really going off on the system of banking when I'm doing that.
But like,

1187
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:08.940
you know,
don't you guys have some fucking friends that,
you know,

1188
01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:11.460
they go to work but they have no direction.

1189
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.550
They have no plan and they just sit around and bitch moaning,

1190
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:16.440
complaining about their fucking life,

1191
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.233
<v 5>you know,</v>

1192
01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:19.810
<v 1>and they feel like they did.</v>

1193
01:13:19.811 --> 01:13:23.770
They have like this sense of entitlement that they just fucking deserve shit

1194
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.230
because well why should this guy be rich?

1195
01:13:26.231 --> 01:13:29.380
And I should is because we made me cause he's smarter than you maybe busted his

1196
01:13:29.381 --> 01:13:33.940
fucking ass.
Maybe you sit around smoking fucking weed of boozing it up all day.

1197
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.150
Like there's no personal responsibility.

1198
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.030
That's what I don't like about this thing.
There's no like,

1199
01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:43.283
<v 5>you know,</v>

1200
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:48.510
<v 1>it's just a hundred percent these people who are running shit are 100% fucking</v>

1201
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:51.910
evil and that all these people who are enslaved are all good people.
Now,

1202
01:13:51.911 --> 01:13:55.800
I'm not saying that,
you know,
there aren't absolutely brilliant fucking people,

1203
01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:59.280
but because of their lot in life,
they ended up in a sweat shop in El Salvador.

1204
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.450
I'm not saying that,
but what I'm saying is everybody in that sweat shop,

1205
01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:05.283
<v 5>you know</v>

1206
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:10.990
<v 1>is not a fucking,
I don't know what it's not.
It's,</v>

1207
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:12.950
you know,
there's some mouth breathing morons in there.

1208
01:14:12.951 --> 01:14:16.570
And this is where it's a bad example cause I'm not condoning sweatshop labor

1209
01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:16.931
either,

1210
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:20.770
but I'm just saying go to a fucking sporting event like I did and just be stone

1211
01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:23.920
sober.
They just sit around and look at the fucking people.

1212
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.730
Okay look at this shit they're eaten.

1213
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:31.210
Look at this shit their drink and look at their behavior,
look at their clothes,

1214
01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:33.250
are hanging off their fat fucking asses.

1215
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.620
And I know the food supply is poisoned and I know that there's a bunch of

1216
01:14:38.621 --> 01:14:40.510
fucking lies and all that type of shit.

1217
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:45.511
But is there any effort on the part of that individual to try to squeegee in

1218
01:14:46.301 --> 01:14:50.050
front of their fucking eyes or do they just accept it?
And if you do,

1219
01:14:50.051 --> 01:14:52.930
just accept it,
you know,

1220
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.100
then how do I feel bad for you?
Okay.

1221
01:14:57.750 --> 01:15:02.680
And I haven't said that,
you know,
racism,
all that stuff about,

1222
01:15:02.681 --> 01:15:05.890
you know,
your third world country.
I don't condone any of that shit.

1223
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.260
I don't get don't sweatshop labor.
I don't condone I it go,

1224
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:13.900
you should pay fucking people and they should.
You know,
they should.

1225
01:15:13.901 --> 01:15:16.990
They should be able to live comfortably.
All right.

1226
01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.370
Obviously I think that I don't condone that Geno's steaks shit day.

1227
01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:23.200
This is America's meek fuck fucking English.

1228
01:15:23.201 --> 01:15:26.200
I don't condone any of that type of shit,
but I don't,

1229
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:30.610
I don't also go to that so liberal where it's just like,
oh,

1230
01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:31.840
look at that drug dealer.

1231
01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.100
If he had the same opportunities I had,

1232
01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:39.060
why he would be a doctor or a lawyer,
it's like,
oh,

1233
01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.120
why would he work at Enron or be a piece of shit banker?

1234
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:44.900
Why would he continue his scum?

1235
01:15:44.901 --> 01:15:48.520
Baggery why when he becomes in my situation,

1236
01:15:48.521 --> 01:15:51.430
does he then become an angel?
I grew up in a suburb.

1237
01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.180
There was called the sacs in my neighborhood.
I sucked at math.

1238
01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.040
I didn't become a doctor or a lawyer.
I tried to,
I was too fucking stupid.

1239
01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.750
So I don't go into that pie in the sky and I just can't get past this guy's

1240
01:16:07.751 --> 01:16:11.170
fucking pregnant pauses.

1241
01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.550
Some people are confused.
It's like,
dude,
maybe you'll fucking confused.

1242
01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:18.130
Do you have a better idea?
Do you have a better fucking system?

1243
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:22.210
I'm sure you do and you can let me guest in your fantasy that you don't have to

1244
01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.620
fucking put to a test.

1245
01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:27.670
So it's never so it can't be criticized because it's not been implemented.

1246
01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.200
Let me guess.
It all works out.

1247
01:16:29.201 --> 01:16:33.520
We're all fucking arm in arm and racism goes away and everybody has a nice pair

1248
01:16:33.521 --> 01:16:38.380
of fucking loafers as they walk out to get their newspaper that was delivered by

1249
01:16:38.381 --> 01:16:42.570
a paper boy and now makes 80 grand a year fright.
I don't fucking know.
Whatever.

1250
01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:45.790
Watch it now that you're,
you're,
you're polluted with my fucking thought on it.

1251
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:48.640
Some people are candidates confused.

1252
01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.480
Does that even look at the government and think that there's some sort of the

1253
01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:54.490
Netherlands going on?
Just the fact that he uses benevolence,
you know,

1254
01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:59.480
making me feel stupid.
What has been Evolent mean?
Is that some sort of fucking,

1255
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.710
uh,
I'm doing something for it.
You know what?
I should look it up.

1256
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:07.620
Let's look it up.
B.
E.
N.
B.
O.
O.
Geez.

1257
01:17:07.621 --> 01:17:10.040
It just disappeared after the v.
It

1258
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.360
<v 2>gave up on me like,
well,
it can't be trying to get,</v>

1259
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:14.930
he can't be trying to solve a spell.
That word.

1260
01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:19.163
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1261
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:23.110
<v 2>Benevolence.
So let's go with the,
the,
the Webster's dictionary.</v>

1262
01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:29.270
A disposition to do good and act of kindness.
A generous gift,

1263
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:34.250
a compulsory law Levy by certain English kings with no authority.

1264
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.790
Then the claim of prerogative.
Oh,
Jesus.

1265
01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:41.690
It takes a left turn on definition number three,
doesn't it?
All right,

1266
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:45.920
so I'm think he's using it in the first or second I disposition to do good.

1267
01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:51.590
Um,
I had a fucking,
who the fuck knows?
All right.
Anyways,
let's,

1268
01:17:51.591 --> 01:17:53.930
let's move on here before we try and solve the world's problems.

1269
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.850
You can go ahead and watch it if you want.
Alright.
Naked picture situation.

1270
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:04.160
A sports illustrated.
I liked that one.
It wasn't really insulting.

1271
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.180
Um,
oh by the way,
the Celtics were Oh and four before they won their first game.

1272
01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:12.170
So I immediately started looking at the draft for next year and which I haven't

1273
01:18:12.171 --> 01:18:15.800
done in the NBA I think ever in a hockey guy,

1274
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:17.450
and I have to tell you,

1275
01:18:17.451 --> 01:18:22.451
I was absolutely fucking shocked to see that the top 10 draft picks projected

1276
01:18:24.321 --> 01:18:26.360
next year,
eight of them are freshmen,

1277
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.020
eight out of 10 of freshmen and the other two are sophomores.

1278
01:18:30.021 --> 01:18:34.730
Like it's such a tragedy that these guys can come out early.

1279
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:38.970
It just,
I'm being selfish as a sports fan cause I know that they have,
you know,

1280
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:41.750
a lot of people like it's a money situation.

1281
01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:45.740
They got to come out to come from a poor family or just a logical thing where

1282
01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.760
I'm going to risk blowing out my knee playing ball for free or I can go to the

1283
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:53.390
NBA now and get $1 million.
I know it's a no brainer,
but you know,

1284
01:18:53.391 --> 01:18:57.140
just back in the day,
he got to watch for years,

1285
01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:03.200
you know of a Patrick Ewing or a Ralph Sampson Hakeem Olajuwon you saw those big

1286
01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:04.370
men like their,

1287
01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:08.420
their college careers overlapping each other and the next great ones you need

1288
01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:10.670
thinking,
oh wow,
maybe win a championship at a time.

1289
01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.950
He's a senior or something like that.

1290
01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:16.700
And just to see like the fact that the junior and senior classes have just been

1291
01:19:16.701 --> 01:19:21.290
so raided by the NBA draft at this,
not a junior or a senior,

1292
01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:26.860
even projected in the top 10 and you're basically going to draft a fucking

1293
01:19:26.861 --> 01:19:30.490
teenager to try to turn the Boston Celtics around.
By the way,

1294
01:19:30.491 --> 01:19:34.900
I'm ordering the NBA package.
I'm like,
this is when I step up as a fan.

1295
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:37.420
Not when that good that when they buy a title,

1296
01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.570
but when they suck a bag of fucking Dicks,

1297
01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.810
that's when I'm going to sit there and watch him rise up from the ashes.

1298
01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:50.020
Okay.
Naked pictures situation.
Hey Bill.
Bill.
Hey,
sports illustrated.

1299
01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.930
I'm in need of some advice,
sir.
Uh,

1300
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:55.720
I have a naked picture situation on my hands,

1301
01:19:55.721 --> 01:19:58.390
although it may not necessarily be what you're thinking.
Well,

1302
01:19:58.391 --> 01:20:03.370
I'd see the you or your girlfriend,
I would guess.
Uh,

1303
01:20:03.371 --> 01:20:08.250
he goes,
so there's this girl,
this lady that to the same graduate

1304
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:13.110
<v 1>school as me,
and this girl was a real cunt dude.
Don't do this.</v>

1305
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.760
If you have a naked picture of her,
don't do it.
He goes,
we're talking pure evil.

1306
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:23.010
She was in school to be a producer and she managed to alienate and demean every

1307
01:20:23.011 --> 01:20:24.930
single person that ever worked with her.

1308
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.410
She was manipulative and awful to everyone.
Ah,

1309
01:20:28.411 --> 01:20:30.210
sounds like she's going to have a successful career.

1310
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.010
She gets into corporate America.
All I'm hearing here is corner office.
Um,

1311
01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.010
she was manipulative and awful to everyone.

1312
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.880
Even her boyfriend who she emasculated constantly,

1313
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:46.200
even in front of his friends while that's on him.
Walk out the door.

1314
01:20:46.201 --> 01:20:48.930
What are you going to do?
Give you a suplex go fuck yourself.

1315
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:54.240
I got a hand and a world full of pussy.
I don't need you anymore lady.

1316
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.090
Um,
now before I continue,

1317
01:20:57.091 --> 01:21:01.650
I should probably say that I realized almost immediately how evil this girl was.

1318
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:06.490
So I always kept my distance and never associated with her in any way.
Uh,

1319
01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:10.860
so that this isn't personal.
Now let's get to the issue at hand.
Okay.

1320
01:21:10.861 --> 01:21:14.880
So he's painted her as completely evil and he's painted himself as being this

1321
01:21:14.881 --> 01:21:17.010
even keeled,
rational person.
I like this.

1322
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:21.510
It's almost as though he wrote the email.
Uh,
now let's get to the issue at hand.

1323
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:26.540
I happened to be perusing the Internet one day in the manner that all men do.

1324
01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:31.110
Oh,
aren't you an LF eloquent little cunt.
Huh?

1325
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:36.210
You mean looking at fucking porn?
You dancing around this?
I'm,
you know,

1326
01:21:36.211 --> 01:21:39.180
I'm starting to think that this woman is innocent and you're actually evil

1327
01:21:39.181 --> 01:21:43.560
person as you continue to try to paint yourself as a fucking hero who's a member

1328
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:48.210
of a Polo Club,
you're rubbing one Authia at filthy fucking animal.

1329
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:53.730
I'm not judging if I do it to happily big grin on my face waving at the

1330
01:21:53.731 --> 01:21:56.970
government and us as I rub one out as like,

1331
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:59.010
as I actually as I bust a nut,

1332
01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:02.520
I say into the camera that I can't see that's watched me.
It's okay.

1333
01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:05.940
I did want to run for office anyways.
I say that as I have an org,

1334
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.200
has they have a orgasm?
I can't even talk this week.
Um,
anyways,

1335
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:13.530
he said in the manner that all men do and I happened to come across some naked

1336
01:22:13.531 --> 01:22:18.531
selfies that this girl took on one of those tumblers devoted to a,

1337
01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:19.681
that kind of thing.

1338
01:22:19.681 --> 01:22:24.060
If you're curious now my question is without trying to sound like an evil

1339
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:28.740
scumbag,
uh,
probably too late.
Should I do anything with them?

1340
01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:34.260
I could probably give a lot of closer and satisfaction by sending them out to

1341
01:22:34.261 --> 01:22:39.250
the people she's fucked over in the pat wait,
is,
is it's this girl.
Oh,

1342
01:22:39.251 --> 01:22:43.750
that this girl took.
Okay.
Um,

1343
01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:46.993
<v 3>wow.</v>

1344
01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:53.080
<v 1>So she treats people like that during the day and at night she takes naked</v>

1345
01:22:53.581 --> 01:22:54.750
selfies of herself.

1346
01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:56.833
<v 3>MMM,</v>

1347
01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.360
<v 1>right.
I know this girl.
I all this kind of girl.</v>

1348
01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:09.030
All right.
Okay,
here we go.
Let's,
let's just try to pick this back up.
This,

1349
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.870
this girl,
she's,
she's like a,
yeah,

1350
01:23:10.871 --> 01:23:14.350
she's like that fucking Wall Street guy that's stealing money and night it needs

1351
01:23:14.351 --> 01:23:17.530
to go to a hooker with a fucking orange ball in his mouth.
He needs,

1352
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:21.250
so I think this girl is uh Oh mate.
Well maybe this is like a narcissistic thing.

1353
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.390
Is she taking pictures of herself like she's just this piece of meat or she

1354
01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:26.230
tried to look hot.

1355
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:28.110
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1356
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:32.640
<v 1>the human fucking psyche,
man.
It's just fucking insane,
you know,</v>

1357
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.410
and our genetic cause I'm out of my fucking mind to,
all right,
let's,

1358
01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.570
let's continue where I'm one of those.
This is a really great email.

1359
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.040
There's so many fucking levels to this.

1360
01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:47.550
You guys a bucket tell who's out of their mind,
hear her or you're like,

1361
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:52.380
oh your out of your mind and this girl actually shut you down because you want

1362
01:23:52.381 --> 01:23:55.380
to take her out for a cup of coffee.
Um,

1363
01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:56.720
<v 3>okay.</v>

1364
01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.040
<v 1>Should I do anything with them?</v>

1365
01:23:58.041 --> 01:24:01.190
I could probably give a lot of closure and satisfaction by sending them out to

1366
01:24:01.191 --> 01:24:04.010
the people she's fucked over in the past.
To be clear,

1367
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:08.720
I would never do this with someone's pictures that were meant privately from me,

1368
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:14.030
but these were already posted publicly online by her or someone else.

1369
01:24:14.031 --> 01:24:18.080
Should I anonymously send out a link to people or just kind of laugh quietly to

1370
01:24:18.081 --> 01:24:20.810
myself about the whole thing and keep it under wraps?

1371
01:24:20.811 --> 01:24:22.730
Any advice would be appreciated.
Well,

1372
01:24:22.731 --> 01:24:26.000
what you're doing as far as like justifying your,

1373
01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:30.090
your role in this if you were to do it that they were already up there is kind

1374
01:24:30.091 --> 01:24:32.810
of like the drug dealers saying like,
well if I didn't sell the drug,

1375
01:24:32.811 --> 01:24:34.880
someone else would.
Um,

1376
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:41.360
so I think you shouldn't do anything and I don't think,

1377
01:24:41.361 --> 01:24:42.320
I don't know why.

1378
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:45.783
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1379
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:51.640
<v 1>I don't know why.
Like what am I trying to say here?</v>

1380
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:55.690
Like what,
what do you think is funny about him?

1381
01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.630
I mean what is the big deal if somebody wants to put some naked photos of

1382
01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:01.510
themselves up there?
They like themselves,
they think they look good.

1383
01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:05.020
I don't understand why it's considered like nudity and that type of thing is

1384
01:25:05.021 --> 01:25:09.280
considered that way.
Uh,
I mean,
she's doing a porno.

1385
01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:13.300
I can see then why she can't get a fucking job at Johnson and Johnson,

1386
01:25:13.301 --> 01:25:15.520
but you know,
she got some naked photos.
Who gives a fuck?

1387
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:20.290
She's probably the best shape of her life,
you know?
I mean,
uh,

1388
01:25:20.291 --> 01:25:23.020
personally I wouldn't do it.
Oh,
who the fuck wants to look at me naked?
Jesus.

1389
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:24.630
What the fuck it that actually disgusted me?

1390
01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:33.390
So anyways,
you know what dude,
don't do that man.
You're just going to be,

1391
01:25:33.391 --> 01:25:35.860
you're getting drawn into her fucking world.
Okay.

1392
01:25:35.861 --> 01:25:38.500
That if that woman is the way you painted her out to be,

1393
01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:43.890
she has a bunch of issues and the best kind of guy she's ever going to attract

1394
01:25:44.441 --> 01:25:49.441
as some ball is fucking spineless jackass that she's not going to respect.

1395
01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:51.543
Um,

1396
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.840
<v 3>okay.</v>

1397
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.591
<v 1>If I had to guess,</v>

1398
01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:58.030
she's a woman who needs a guy to tell her what's what it fucking,
uh,
you know,

1399
01:25:58.031 --> 01:26:01.420
put a heart on her,
you know,
in the bedroom.

1400
01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:05.450
She needs to be face down in the pillows being told,

1401
01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:08.930
what the fuck to do did that.
She got some sort of fucking issue man.

1402
01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.460
But you know,
just be happy.

1403
01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:13.970
You're not going to work for if she's out of your life.
Okay.
And she's,
you know,

1404
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.920
and if she walks around treating people like that,

1405
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:20.490
she's never going to really develop,
um,

1406
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:25.060
lasting relationships,
meaningful relationships.
Uh,

1407
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:29.480
she's not going to have people in her life that would step out in front of a bus

1408
01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:33.830
for,
you know,
so she's never going to get the full human experience.

1409
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:36.860
I feel like that is enough of a punishment.

1410
01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:40.910
You don't need to go in there and like that.
That's really like a,
uh,

1411
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:45.380
I know I've vengeance thing is very seventh grade girl and I think you're above

1412
01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:46.880
that.
Just,
you know,

1413
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:51.920
just leave them alone and continue to jerk off to them.
You're fucking creepy.

1414
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:57.890
I'm not going to lie to you.
I would too.
I'm not judging you.
Welcome.

1415
01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.450
Welcome to my level.
All right.
French revolution and bankers,

1416
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:05.870
a high there,
Billy bandwagon.

1417
01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:09.260
I've been a fan of the men Monday morning podcast for a while now.

1418
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:14.090
And you are on a crab.
You were on the crab feed podcast.

1419
01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.410
Oh yeah.
With Jay Lawson on the all things comedy network,
everybody,

1420
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:23.000
he said it reminded me of something pre-revolution France was almost identical

1421
01:27:23.001 --> 01:27:26.330
to the way the US is now.
Oh God.

1422
01:27:26.331 --> 01:27:29.570
I hate when people keep predicting the demise of this country.

1423
01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.990
Like they're giving us some sort of insight like people in this country can't

1424
01:27:32.991 --> 01:27:34.580
see it coming.
All right.

1425
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:37.820
I'm not saying every mouth breathing more sees it coming.
You know,

1426
01:27:37.821 --> 01:27:42.560
anybody who has any sort of intelligence,
we see it coming.
Okay.

1427
01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.340
All right there,
Mr fucking rubbing your God Damn Chin.
Uh,

1428
01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.270
actually he's probably an American too.
Um,
all right.

1429
01:27:50.271 --> 01:27:53.930
France in 1787,
head grinding,

1430
01:27:53.931 --> 01:27:58.340
poverty tax inequality.
It was nearly bankrupt from the seven years' war.

1431
01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:03.750
<v 2>Ah,
and then he writes familiar question mark.
Ah,</v>

1432
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:07.230
I'm not even gonna read this fucking thing.
You're already so up your own ass.

1433
01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.970
Wow.
I never looked at it that way.
Wait,

1434
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:16.410
does history repeat itself?
Gee,
you're really onto something here,

1435
01:28:16.411 --> 01:28:20.070
sir.
Good fucking Lord.

1436
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:23.460
You know what's funny about this type of shit is this probably isn't even this

1437
01:28:23.461 --> 01:28:24.271
person's thought.

1438
01:28:24.271 --> 01:28:26.970
They'd probably just regurgitating something else that they've read from a

1439
01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:29.280
website,
which I do all the fucking time.

1440
01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.880
I do the exact same thing you're doing here,
sir.
Except by Nalco.

1441
01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:36.270
Familiar some fee people.
Some people are confused.

1442
01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.130
Why can't people just present a fucking,

1443
01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:43.080
I done an opinion without like patting themselves on the back about how fucking

1444
01:28:43.081 --> 01:28:47.910
smart they are all the time.
You know,
you're a fucking moron.
Just like me.
Okay,

1445
01:28:47.911 --> 01:28:52.770
I'm going to read this and I'm going to,
I'm going to skip over
familiar.

1446
01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:57.150
Does that ring a bell pot calling the kettle.
Who?

1447
01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.130
Ooh.
Ah.
With your fucking smoking jacket.
You all right?

1448
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.650
<v 1>Here we go.
Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1449
01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.060
All right.
He goes familiar.

1450
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:14.090
It should be the modern us actually has worse wealth and tax inequality than

1451
01:29:15.361 --> 01:29:19.200
1787 France and even pre fall of Rome.

1452
01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.150
So this is all old shit.

1453
01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:24.510
I've already heard this theory a zillion times before you present it and you

1454
01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:24.661
know,

1455
01:29:24.661 --> 01:29:29.220
and I'm not going to fucking read this and get all fucking depressed because I

1456
01:29:29.221 --> 01:29:30.054
understand this.

1457
01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.350
This is why I got out of conspiracy theory and just got a dog and I'm sitting

1458
01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:38.460
here watching the bread and circus of fucking sports like I never have before

1459
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:42.510
because there's no way out of this.
Rather than present this shit to me,

1460
01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:45.210
I want you to write back to me and give me your solution.

1461
01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:49.260
You give me the fucking solution rather than pointing out the fucking obvious as

1462
01:29:49.261 --> 01:29:51.780
you rub your God Damn Chin.
All right?

1463
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:53.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1464
01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.740
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.
All right.
Sorry.
I was having such a great God damn day.</v>

1465
01:29:57.800 --> 01:29:59.150
She's wearing an hour and a half in here.

1466
01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.570
Milan one week did a son of a bitch this week.
All right.

1467
01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.710
Uplifting documentaries couldn't come soon enough on the podcast.

1468
01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:10.580
A Billy boy loved the podcast and all your specials.

1469
01:30:10.581 --> 01:30:13.460
Can't wait to see in Dublin and a few weeks.
You're a good man.

1470
01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:18.870
Tell all those other Irish country to come out and see this German,
Irish con.

1471
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:23.640
We're all drink some fucking Bushmills afterwards.
What do you say?
And I

1472
01:30:25.190 --> 01:30:30.050
barely read faces.
Um,

1473
01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.110
I got a hot,

1474
01:30:31.111 --> 01:30:36.050
warm and documentary for you since black fish and dirty wars might've got you

1475
01:30:36.051 --> 01:30:38.060
down a bit.
I appreciate that people,

1476
01:30:38.061 --> 01:30:42.230
I love when you send the documentaries that are eyeopening and make me feel like

1477
01:30:42.231 --> 01:30:43.250
I want to kill myself,

1478
01:30:43.251 --> 01:30:47.720
but also every once in a while you gotta give me a little sugar.
Um,
so he goes,

1479
01:30:47.721 --> 01:30:49.430
they might've got you down a little bit.

1480
01:30:49.730 --> 01:30:53.780
Here's some uplifting stuff that's called the pipe and it's about a tiny
village,

1481
01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:56.870
um,
in the,
in the west coast of Ireland,

1482
01:30:57.590 --> 01:31:01.880
taking on a massive oil corporation and winning.
Oh,
I love it already.

1483
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:04.630
Even if it isn't true.
I love it.
Um,

1484
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.990
it focuses on the community's refusal to have a dangerous pipeline running

1485
01:31:08.991 --> 01:31:09.824
through their village.

1486
01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.970
It shows the vicious brutality of the cops against the protestors and in

1487
01:31:13.971 --> 01:31:16.530
particular five men who goes,
so go,

1488
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:20.480
goes so far as to serve time in prison,
to get justice.
Dude,

1489
01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:25.220
those guys are saints.
That's when you are committed to a cause.

1490
01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:30.140
All right.
And that's when you know they should make a movie about you.

1491
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:35.930
And then fucking actors who have personal trainers and microbiotic diets,

1492
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.490
you know,

1493
01:31:37.490 --> 01:31:41.840
show up with abs and get to play you and your life story that William Wallace

1494
01:31:41.841 --> 01:31:42.674
Shit,
you know,

1495
01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:47.710
five men who goes so as far so far as to serve time in prison to get justice.

1496
01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:49.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1497
01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.750
<v 1>That's just fucking,
they don't,
they don't make,</v>

1498
01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:55.200
they don't make men like that anymore.
Well I guess they do.

1499
01:31:55.201 --> 01:31:57.480
They made five of them on the west coast.
Ireland.

1500
01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.730
God bless him for once the people win.

1501
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:06.400
And as a recent development in the case has seen the shell oil company have lost

1502
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:10.600
their license for work on the west coast of Ireland.
I'm watching that today.

1503
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.190
Today.
Here's the link.
It's up on Youtube.
Everybody,
you should check that out.

1504
01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:20.191
It's called the pipe and another one for the full documentary.

1505
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:24.670
Oh,
I guess,
okay.
This is the link for the trailer is on Youtube,

Um,

1507

you can't,

1508
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:33.460
if you go to surf for Shit and you can't find it,
like I always do,

1509
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:38.850
it's called www.filmsforaction.org/watch/the_pipe_two zero one zero slash again,

1510
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:52.540
and those are all backslash is by the way
it is it backslash,
right?
Yeah.

1511
01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:57.460
Excellent.
All right.
All right.
That's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.
Um,

1512
01:32:57.790 --> 01:33:02.710
I want to thank everybody who came out to my shows this weekend in DC,

1513
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:05.560
New York and Philadelphia.
It was just,
it was fucking,

1514
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:09.790
I'm going to use the word magical there.
I said it at the risk of everybody,

1515
01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:14.230
you know,
coming at me in a homophobic way.
I don't give a shit.
I don't,

1516
01:33:14.231 --> 01:33:17.800
I like the twinkle toes,
so come at me that way.
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

1517
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:21.880
It was a magical weekend.
I had a great time and you know what?

1518
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:23.050
It's even going to get more.

1519
01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:27.790
It's getting to be even more fairy dust on my career this weekend.
The final leg

1520
01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:33.280
of the Billy red state tour.
All right.
Um,

1521
01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:37.450
I am playing in Deadwood,
South Dakota.

1522
01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:42.490
November 15th,
November 16th,
I'm at the Brady Theater in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.

1523
01:33:42.491 --> 01:33:46.210
And then I'm wrapping it up at the Orpheum theater in Wichita,
Kansas.

1524
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:50.410
I will be coming out taking pictures and signing shit and all that.

1525
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:54.820
I apologize to people who came out this weekend,
um,
to the earlier shows.

1526
01:33:55.480 --> 01:34:00.410
Um,
a couple of nights I had early shows and I can't go out there cause it's slow

1527
01:34:00.411 --> 01:34:05.110
shit down.
And then I get in trouble with the union because they have to go dark.

1528
01:34:05.111 --> 01:34:07.750
So I can't go out there and load the other crowd in.

1529
01:34:07.751 --> 01:34:10.600
So I really feel bad about that because I actually really enjoy going out and

1530
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:14.320
saying hello to people.
So my apologies to,
uh,

1531
01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:18.880
people on the first show of I'm in Philly and in New York.

1532
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.600
Um,
and the second show,
that beacon,
I actually came out there late because,
uh,

1533
01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.290
I had a lot of friends in Chicago,
so I got some guilt about that,
but all right.

1534
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:32.830
The deadwood showed the Oklahoma and Wichita.

1535
01:34:32.831 --> 01:34:36.490
I'm coming out after all those shows and a whatever you want to do,
pictures,

1536
01:34:36.491 --> 01:34:38.950
autographs,
what are you going to do?
I really appreciate everybody coming out.

1537
01:34:38.951 --> 01:34:43.120
It's been a hell of a fucking year and a and then you go and then I got one more

1538
01:34:43.121 --> 01:34:46.390

1540
01:34:49.181 --> 01:34:54.181
and after that I got one last giant tour and that's when I do the European tour

1541
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:58.430
and I'm going to fucking do my best

1542
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:04.820
to fucking murder when I go over there.
Um,
I am really,

1543
01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:08.930
I'm amped up for these shows,
man.
I got to finish strong.
And then the last one,

1544
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:13.370
the Wiltern theatre in Los Angeles.
My home city here,

1545
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:18.790
and it's going to be me in the entire Rosebowl Deus is going to be there.

1546
01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:26.900
All right.
The Ocean's 11 of the Rose Bowl.
Everybody is going to be there.

1547
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:30.050
It's going to be me,
Joe Barnick,

1548
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:33.950
Jason Law and Andrew Feminists.
That's it.

1549
01:35:33.951 --> 01:35:38.170
The four horsemen of the fucking rose bowl.
We're all going to be there.

1550
01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:42.980
I'll do and stand up at the Wiltern theater to bring in the new year.
You know,

1551
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.160
we'll be smoking cigars,
drinking a one quick thing is scotch.

1552
01:35:46.161 --> 01:35:49.340
Before we go home and go to bed and then go to see the granddaddy of them all

1553
01:35:49.341 --> 01:35:51.560
the next day.
It's going to be a hell of a fucking night.

1554
01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:55.100
That's going to be an unbelievable fucking night.
I'm calling it right now.

1555
01:35:55.110 --> 01:35:58.970
If you ever want to see the fucking beautiful knuckleheads that I hang out,

1556
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:02.240
you can see hang out with you.
I'm telling you,
go to that show.
All right.

1557
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:05.750
I'm done with that hype and my own shit.
Here's the final thing here.

1558
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.980
