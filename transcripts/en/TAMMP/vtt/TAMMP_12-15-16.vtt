we have a special guest in studio.

12
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.470
This is the one and only comic legend rich shiner who has a new book.

13
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:41.430
He's here to plug,
um,
that I actually got a couple months ago,

14
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.930
but my wife was so god damn pregnant,

15
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.960
I've only been able to read bits and pieces of it.
I read all of,

16
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:50.700
I killed in 2006.
He's got a book called,
uh,
uh,
kicking through the ashes.

17
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:54.390
My life as a stand up in the 1980s comedy boom,

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.660
which personally is my favorite era because I watched all of it and that was,

19
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.240
and that made me want to be a comedian.
And all that.
So rich,
welcome.

20
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.150
Welcome to the podcast bill.
Um,
I got to ask,

21
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.690
so what year did you start officially as a comedian?

22
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.310
Because everybody always has their,
yeah,
yeah.

23
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.760
Well I did to open mikes and I went to college for a semester.
He'd always it,

24
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.660
they always try to delay when they stuff.

25
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.270
I really want to be doing it six months.
They're like fucking a 52.
So when,

26
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.650
when is your official?
Uh,

27
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.930
<v 2>January [inaudible] 77.
Wow.
Yeah,
it's amazing.</v>

28
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:31.720
Washington DC.
There were no comedy clubs.
I was going to say like,
wait,

29
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
where was there to Gig?
Yeah,
it was,
uh,
a friend of mine,
you know,
I was funny.

30
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.740
And he said,
you're funny.
You've got to do this.

31
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.050
I don't even know if we knew it would call it stand up.

32
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:41.730
He's just going to take you down.
Dude.
We can do this.
You know,
you could do it.

33
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.930
The comedy at this plan,
you were in law school and law school.
Okay.
And uh,

34
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.340
and uh,
was the ego on a coffee house?
It was just this basement in a church,

35
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.480
you know,
I'm just all talent nights.
Right.
And I,
and I've followed a poet.

36
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
I saw the tape because my brother,
yeah,
I have the tape and the tape.
Audio,

37
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.100
video,
audio,
just audio.
It's just a lie.

38
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.030
Always big black box cause sets like a shoe size cassette player.
Right.

39
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.900
Recorder and a and m and the poet is,
his last line was like the mango.

40
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.980
We are ripe for the revolution.
Oh God.
Right.

41
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.160
<v 1>Gate Two late,
Huh?
Exactly.
It's way ahead on mango.</v>

42
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:20.610
Nobody's talking mango is 77 right.
But you're right.
Wait,
bind.

43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.840
The Vietnam was over way over and he was still trying to do that shit.

44
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.070
So when you guys went,

45
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.580
that was what fascinated back then because it because of you guys that there was

46
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:30.361
a comedy club,

47
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.900
your whole generation is the reason why there's a comedy club scene.

48
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:37.500
And I'm always like read stuff about Jay Leno and it was just like,
yeah,

49
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.570
you need to be like,
yeah,
go down to the combat zone,

50
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:42.200
which is where I'd like the red light district,
what Boston used to be.
And you'd,

51
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.710
you'd go on between like strip

52
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.360
<v 2>anywhere,
anywhere,
anywhere.
This Guy Howard vine who took me out the first time,</v>

53
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.340
he was like my unofficial,
she says,
I found another place,

54
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.610
like a talent night called the gay cabaret.
And we were,
so we had,

55
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.470
we just don't like gay cabaret,
like the Flintstones,

56
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:58.470
this is a 77 minute classes was packed,
packed.

57
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:00.220
There was nobody out the closet except

58
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.910
<v 1>my overpopulation pushed out,
you know?
Right.
So we could end there and it was,</v>

59
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.180
you know,
it was a gay gay club and the guy was very good.
And I said,
hey fellas,

60
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.680
you know,
normally great soap and talent and that,
you know,
but,
uh,
this is,

61
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.170
this is ladies night went once a month to have a ladies man.
And again,

62
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.220
we're so clueless,
we don't get it.
We're like,
ladies,
like,
fantastic man.

63
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.660
I still don't care.
What does that mean?
It was lesbian slash items.

64
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.530
It was lesbian.
Oh,
I thought you meant bottoms ladies nights out.
Yeah.

65
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.030
Wow.
And I go up in front of this lesbian crowd.
I mean,
they,
you know,

66
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.060
I'm the reason they're there to hide.
Get away from guys like me.

67
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.120
How did it go up?
Just a swing.
Oh my God.
I mean,
you know what I mean?
Chill.

68
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.010
I'm chill.
Freezing cold.
I mean,
a woman told me offstage,
finally,
just,

69
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.820
I mean,
I got one like I did.
I was,
I did,
like my buddy told me,
he said,

70
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.420
you said like,

71
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.000
I guess I'm your worst nightmare or something and got a kind of a left.

72
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:47.920
But you know,
you have student joy.
I thought,
oh,

73
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:52.120
that's encouragement to do more instead of take that as your exit as a cue that

74
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.700
we,
we,
we didn't come here for this.
Yeah,
you're done.

75
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.780
And the woman just walked up on stage,
took me by the arm and led me off.

76
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.680
Just let me,
Oh,
I've heard of that.
You know,
when I started out,
I,

77
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.500
I had a Gig and I,
I didn't know it was a,
I didn't know it was a gay club.

78
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.363
I just got a Gig.

79
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.790
The fucking guy didn't tell me the place was called Queen of hearts.

80
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.090
And what killed me was it was only a couple of towns over from,
uh,

81
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.870
from where I lived and,
uh,
yeah.
And that was like still,
it was the eighties,

82
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.830
early nineties.
I was still like totally like a,
um,
you know,
not accepted.

83
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:25.780
There was no,
let me guess.
Billy crystal played gloves,

84
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.450
like the only guy played a gay character and that whole thing just went away.

85
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.330
So when I found out I was all like,
parented,
my truck's out there,

86
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:35.500
I was all like homophobic,
come over to suck a dick.
Right?
So I,
um,

87
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.520
I went there and I was wearing my college,

88
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.670
like sweatshirt came walking in like a 23,
24 year old.

89
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.600
And I walked by this guy and I forget what the hell he said,
you just said like,

90
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.680
oh my God,
my fantasy or something like that.
And I was just like,
I was like,
wow,

91
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.820
that was really forward.
So I went down to the end of the bar and uh,

92
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:58.030
one of the women I was working with,
I was like,
I walked in,
she goes,
hey bill,

93
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.770
how you doing?
And I said,
hey,
I said,
I said,
guys,
Hey,

94
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:02.740
that guy down the end of the party,
but he's a little happy.
She goes,
why?

95
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.310
I got a guy and go down the on the bar.
He goes,
I go,
he's a little happy.

96
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.260
And she finally got,
she goes,
bill,
everybody's a little happy here.
This,
this is,

97
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:13.780
this is a gay bar.
And then I looked around,
I was like,
Oh shit.

98
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.170
I was totally freaked the fuck out there.
Then,
you know,

99
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:19.210
by the time I get to New York,
I was just like,
and I,
you know,

100
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.880
you start broaden your horizons.
You don't give a shit.
But uh,

101
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.530
so you started out there.
So when I,
what,

102
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.960
what made it blow up the way it did that all of a sudden there was just,

103
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.290
you could,
you know,

104
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.600
instead of having to go on after a poet or a stripper or whatever,
he had to do,

105
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.820
like,
I was always interested like,
what,
what?

106
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.350
Like what years did all of a sudden these scenes started,
all these independent,

107
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:44.320
like Boston had a comedy scene,
right?
The thing,
whoa.
You know those guys,

108
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.800
those Lenny Clarke and Barry Crimmins of these there,
there's a scene up there.

109
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:49.750
There was a scene in Washington DC.
We found this bar.

110
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.530
This guy started doing comedy at this bar.
So Lewis Black,
myself,

111
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:55.420
Kevin Rooney Ronson,

112
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.160
and all these guys showed up to start doing up as a little barn

113
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.720
<v 2>southeast Anacostia like it was the fact that it was stand up exclusively</v>

114
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:04.400
might've been like,
oh yeah,
oh yeah.

115
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.760
It became packed immediately it became like wow to me that,
and there was a,

116
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.520
in San Francisco with a holy city zoo and that comedy scene,

117
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.060
there was one in Houston and comedy workshop would Hixon Kennison and those guys

118
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:15.300
were starting out.
Now did Elliot,

119
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.070
cause I know Dangerfield was around since like the 60 so like New York and La

120
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.520
Actually,
hey look,
I was doing it for like a year or so.

121
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.290
And a friend of mine said,
she goes,
you know,

122
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:27.170
there are comics like you're doing this up in New York City.
I was like,
what?

123
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.080
She goes,
he has her comedy clubs.
So she took me up there and there were,

124
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.740
you know,
the Improv,
the comic strip and catch a rising star.

125
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.050
But I didn't know about until I went there.
That's so fast.

126
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.930
And because like there's no internet,
nobody knew anything.

127
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.060
Like this guy comes in when light comes into l Brooklyn,

128
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.810
it's like you don't rent.
And he walks up to me,
he goes,
hey,
I want to do uh,

129
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.170
some standup comedy.
Yeah,
we at the end of the show,
he like put guys on the,
no,

130
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:49.550
I'm a comic out in San Francisco.

131
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.950
We were doing like this out in San Francisco is like what?

132
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.660
She had got a place of holy city zoo.

133
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.870
His name was Tony Depaul and he was running a holy city.
So,
so he told me,

134
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.270
you're going to come out of here man.
We're doing this out there too.

135
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.460
And I was like,
what?
People are doing this?

136
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.760
You didn't think like people are doing it,
we're just doing it.

137
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.100
And you don't know.
Nobody was talking to as a scene in Philly,

138
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.640
there were about six or seven cities that had scenes percolate,
percolate.

139
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.440
So how did those guys back in the day,

140
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.540
like if they had to do way back to like Ed Sullivan,

141
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.370
like how did you put your set together?

142
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.920
I know those guys did Vegas and they did casinos.

143
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.110
I guess you just had to be based in New York or La to get stage time to
actually,

144
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.460
yeah,
but those guys,
they,
but they didn't,
there were places all over there were,

145
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.310
you know,
the,
the,

146
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.220
the nightclubs started happening right after World War One when like supper

147
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.810
clubs and stuff.
They started doing the speakeasy and all when,

148
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.140
when prohibition came in,
so the comics moved in,

149
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.510
out of all the bill started moving into these nightclubs to make real money.

150
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.360
Right.
That's where it started.
So they're always,
you know,

151
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:46.970
back in the fifties and sixties they called them the toilets where he's guys

152
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.400
were trained.
You know,
they got to,
you got to work the toilets,
a little,

153
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.550
a little bar out in Jersey to do a little comedy,
a little show.

154
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.380
You'd be part of the show,
you know,
there's a singer,
a dancer,
right.

155
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.870
It wasn't exclusively comedy.
Look for danger fields.
Wasn't exclusively stand up,

156
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.210
you know,
dangerous how to singers and stand ups.

157
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.430
And also they were having said that the piano,
they haven't changed shit off.

158
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.640
Hello Ma'am.
No,
no.
So what year did,
so then I guess,

159
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.800
imagine as a supper club started to go away,

160
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.270
then your guys scene then created that Cedar Comedy Club.
That's right.

161
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.510
To my generation.
They weren't going out to the dinner clubs,
you know,

162
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.340
calling out and have a dinner and see a show.

163
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.840
Nobody was doing any more that was out.

164
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:27.110
You know how he's dressed up as old people stuff.
So we are in rock concert.

165
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:29.180
So then that kind of like started fading.
Right.
You know,

166
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.020
you're going get a little older,
you want to date,
you just can't go date,

167
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.700
you know,
so everybody's kind of looking for the next thing.

168
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.510
And it happened like some guy opens up a comedy club,
you know,

169
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.060
there's the three paint comedy clubs out here in the late seventies in

170
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:42.540
California.
Those.

171
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.390
Mitzi opened a place down in Pacific beach and 76 and moved over to s into La

172
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.700
Jolla 77th and there was a guy,

173
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.280
Mike Kelly opened up place the left stop down in Newport beach.

174
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.850
And then Mike Lacey,
which you've been at the comedy magic club down her most,

175
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.070
the beach in [inaudible] 78 they were the first three paying,
like paying.

176
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.210
They bring comics in from La and pay him a couple hundred bucks.
Wow.

177
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.460
And then Garvin's in Washington DC opened in [inaudible] 79 January [inaudible]

178
00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:10.260
79 start paying comics from New York to come down and do it.

179
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.390
So at this point you've been doing it like two years.

180
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:15.580
I've been doing cheers and I became an emcee there.
That's why metal is comics.

181
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.670
I started working with Seinfeld,
Bill Maher and Overton.

182
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.980
And at what point did you,
did you start to sense like,
wow man,

183
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:27.240
like I sort of jumped into this thing that has just taken off.

184
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:30.720
Like what point did it really seem like,
like this?
Like the sky's the limit.

185
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:33.600
It was almost like a real estate boom.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I didn't,
you know,

186
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.750
it didn't until we,
well,
I mean it sucked into it.
We weren't making money.

187
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.180
You know that the comic strip in Fort Little loader to open like January or so

188
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.220
80 I remember going down there and I'm working with my first wife,

189
00:09:44.221 --> 00:09:47.610
Carol Lee for Joe Pollster,
Mark Schiff and Kelly Rogers and,

190
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.840
and Kelly pulls me over and a comedy Condo,
right?
That the first comedy condo.

191
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.590
So it's clean and just kind of float.
It's gonna float inside.
Wow.

192
00:09:56.591 --> 00:09:59.250
Got a boat and he goes gigs at that point.
He goes,
come here,
come here.

193
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.790
Any of this,
whatever this guy says you can do,
tell them you can do it.

194
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:04.980
If he asks whatever he has told you,
you can do it.
It's not going to phone guy.

195
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:07.950
He goes,
Hey,
I just opened up this club in Ottawa,
Canada.

196
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.530
I need a guy could go do two 45 minutes,

197
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:14.400
such can you do two separate 45 minutes show?
It's like,
Oh yeah,
Jesus Christ.

198
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.130
I hang up the phone.
I got Kevin,
I got like a half a half.
They buy everything.

199
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.910
They take everything I'm killing.
Right.
I'm killing everything.

200
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.570
He says don't worry,
you'll do it.
Go do it.
So I grew up there.
I do it a week.

201
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:25.230
Right.

202
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.410
You know that my strategy was to do all the materials you need to cause he's the

203
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.810
same crowd.
He didn't,
it was a big bar.
It was just a big word.

204
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.690
Physical comedy rooms.
At first it wasn't like they set up,
oh we're going to be,

205
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.300
you know,
we're open up a new club,
we're going to build this club.
They just,

206
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.050
there was a rock bar.
He wasn't getting a lot of business in rock bar.

207
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.670
I don't know where you got the idea of someone to do comedy.
Right.
So once,

208
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.610
twice a month he was doing comedy,
brought a comedian it.

209
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.130
So I'm gonna just guess what happened cause they don't really pay attention to

210
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:52.440
how long you're up there.
It's just how well you're doing.

211
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:56.170
Did you pull up short on your sets or did you do think I was counting back
there,

212
00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:58.140
man.
I'm drinking shots.
I'm trying,

213
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.510
I'm trying to come up with Deb smoking weed between the sets,

214
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:01.380
trying to come up with new,
you know,

215
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:04.140
I'm just up there doing whatever I can do to try to,
you know what I mean?

216
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.830
I did all the material I could do that I had upfront and then just ran around

217
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:11.190
the room like Jerry Lewis,
you know,
like I was out of my mind.
Wow.

218
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.220
You know just you save a bit for the end to closing thoughts about saving that

219
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.860
closer opener is like just funny in a hold them just hold the stage and in the

220
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.510
and you pulled it off.
I pulled off so the end of the week the guy goes,

221
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.020
he's paying me.
He goes,
this was great man.
It was like a weekend,
you know,

222
00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:30.810
like three days or something.
He said guys on the phone wants to talk to you.

223
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:34.020
I pick up the phone cause the guy goes,
I got,
I got a club in Montreal,

224
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.440
I heard you're great.
You want to come down here now come on over.

225
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.283
Just come over now.

226
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.180
And I did the next week of Montreal and then he puts him in the phone with,

227
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.350
with uh,
mark,
um,
uh,

228
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.590
from Yuk Yuks Breslin from Mark Breslin from [inaudible].
Same thing I want,

229
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.890
right.
The Breslin in Toronto.

230
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.590
So I went up there and I did like three weeks in a row.
Came back.

231
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:57.070
I'm a headliner.
I thought I'm a headliner.
Wow.
I didn't know what it was.

232
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.390
I was at two,
three years in.
I was,
yeah,
it was like in 1980.

233
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:04.960
So I'm like three years in,
but I was opened up for a lot of rock bands.

234
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.860
I was at at that point,
you could quit your day job.
I didn't have a day job.

235
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.180
My last,
my last day job was,
yeah.
About then because I was,

236
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.160
my last day job was working in New York City.

237
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:18.070
I was cleaning out apartments for the mob.
I didn't know that's what I was doing,

238
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:22.380
but that's what I was doing,
cleaning them out.
What happened to all down,
down,

239
00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:25.540
down,
down to X.
Got shot for return in the fucking truck.

240
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.240
What would you get this?
You don't remember this,
but 77 down that err,
my,

241
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.860
my first apartment was in a base,
wasn't in real apartment.
It,

242
00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:36.970
she slept some balls thrown up every other building was abandoned.

243
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.310
Squatters everywhere.
Oh,
that's,
someone's had an east village bankrupt,
right?

244
00:12:40.311 --> 00:12:43.360
He's bankrupt.
Dinero in taxi error.
Exactly.

245
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:46.420
So they start selling buildings for a buck.

246
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.950
But you had to promise to rehab the building within a year that turn it into a

247
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.040
rental proper homelike God.
Right.
So they're $10 so I'm not,

248
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.610
I could be set for you had to fix them.
Right,
right.
Got It.
Fixed them up.

249
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:00.850
So I'm having a hard time paying the rent.
The landlord goes,
hey man,

250
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:04.120
you can you do carpentry work?
And I go,

I can do carpentry work.

251
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.970
He says like,
Oh,

252
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.260
how much of your life has been like,
yeah,
I can do anything.

253
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.800
They just fucking showing up and running around like Jackie Lewis.

254
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.640
That's amazing.
So you say,
yeah,
want won't show up.
I go over there.

255
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.840
These guys in New York guys,
they figured out in three seconds.

256
00:13:16.841 --> 00:13:20.380
I can't really do carpentry,
but they um,
you know,
I'm an okay guy.
You know,

257
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:22.720
it gives him cigarettes and beer.
Go get some cigarettes and beer for us,

258
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:25.900
you know,
go do this,
go do that.
You know,
I would go for an form,
right.

259
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.290
So at the end of the day,
the guy goes,
yeah,
you can't do carpet,

260
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.470
but can you clean out apartment?
I go,
well yeah,
I can,
you know,

261
00:13:31.471 --> 00:13:34.450
I can tell me a manual labor man.
That's,
that's how we stayed on the planet.

262
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:38.830
Manual labor.
So I show up the next morning,
there's three young Italian guys.

263
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.320
I didn't even know they're standing outside of building to pass around a half

264
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:45.490
point.
Oh,
they go,
hey,

Yeah,
I'm the new guy.
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay,
let's go.

265
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:49.360
We weren't worth throwing squatters out.
We're cleaning out apartments.
Oh God.

266
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:52.780
We're throwing people out of apartments.
You know,
we're going in with throwing,

267
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.120
we're going into the shooting galleries.
Man.

268
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.680
People are shooting up with phone stuff out.

269
00:13:56.681 --> 00:14:01.000
The windows were hustling people out.
Well Shit,

270
00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:03.850
five bucks an hour break,
five bucks an hour under the table,

271
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:05.370
five bucks and throw people out on the street.

272
00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:08.770
Now break down the whole emotion of that.
You walk up to the doors and unlocked.

273
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:10.300
Is it locked and you walk up the door.

274
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.300
And I had been in a squatter place when I first moved up there,

275
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:16.960
so I kind of understood it,
you know?
But you see it like extension cables,

276
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:18.580
running them from building a building.
They were,
you know,

277
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:21.460
there's still interest in from everywhere to back up with your life.

278
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.760
So how the fuck did you say you go up to,
you live in the water building?

279
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.590
When I first,
how does that go down?
That was,

280
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.280
that was 74 when I went to New York in [inaudible] 74 but I had no plan and you

281
00:14:30.281 --> 00:14:33.020
had no money and then you'll see an abandoned building.
You walk,

282
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.700
there's other people in there.
You Guy got escape from New York,

283
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.280
people crawling up out of manholes.
People,
people,
they'd get a building,

284
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.400
they don't,
they put you see locks when outside of the door.
There were no locks,

285
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:48.700
like a key lock,
right?
I would have a padlock,
padlock.
Right.

286
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:51.890
That's how he got in and get out.
And then he'd locked inside it bolts and lock

287
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.820
<v 1>the insight and it have electricity stealing from one building to another</v>

288
00:14:55.821 --> 00:14:58.460
building,
whatever they were running cables or someplace that had no electricity,

289
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.220
they would just care that it wasn't a fire hazard.

290
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.130
I love that there's some guy that actually could be working as an electrician,

291
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:07.130
but he's deciding to live for free in this fucking building.

292
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.850
If people are fascinating to me.
All right,
at night,
now you're on the other side.

293
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.570
Okay,
then fucking student has become the master.

294
00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:16.970
Now you're going to throw someone out like yourself as you want on drugs.

295
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:21.230
But so what,
what was that?
Pos crying.
Screaming,
fighting some no.

296
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:23.060
People were like,
okay cool.
Cause they'd gotten notice.

297
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:26.210
It wasn't like surprised they did ignore it and notice it.

298
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:29.330
Put those as buildings and we bought and you've got to leave,
evacuate,
you know,

299
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.440
or get out whatever it is.
And they were ignoring it or they,

300
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.500
and so some people are cool.
Okay.
We're going.
Some people that kicked in doors,

301
00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:39.020
we go running in,
we thrown her stuff out the windows,
right.

302
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.630
It was one where there's so many abandoned buildings and they'd be like,

303
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:42.171
all right,
fuck it.

304
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.600
I'll just grab my shit and just go down the street and around the corner.

305
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:47.210
I'll have another one.
Yeah.
I don't know what their attitude was.
I mean,

306
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:50.300
I didn't really care.
I mean it was pretty hectic.
It was pretty.

307
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.940
Did you have to physically do a couple times we had to like fight off people or

308
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.160
push them around,
but she hasn't guys,
these guys were rough.

309
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:00.170
They were young and rough man.
Oh,
okay.

310
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.460
Did they have the Joe Pesci shame suits and shit.
I watch too many movies.

311
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:05.900
They were just right where they were dressed.

312
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.050
They were dressed and ready for business.
The three quarter letter to the court.

313
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.770
A leather,
but have you jerk off like Warren?
I was knocked that guy,
man.

314
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.860
Wow,
that's fucking amazing.
So,
um,

315
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.500
I don't want to spend too much in your past because we're here to,
to,
to,
uh,

316
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.430
I mean we're definitely gonna go back because I'm a geek for all of this shit.

317
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:29.060
But,
um,
let's talk about the presence here.
You're kicking through the ashes.

318
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:30.350
Let the parts that I read,

319
00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:35.000
what I loved about it is you do not sugarcoat any,

320
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.330
like the what happened?
The odds of you making it anything.

321
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:43.130
It was really kind of like,
like you just kind of laid it out there.
Like,
how do,

322
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:47.090
um,
I know you've done books in the past and stuff and how did this whole thing

323
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:50.510
like,
I mean,
it had to be through just telling stories.
The guys like me,

324
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.570
no one know how interested I am in this shit.
You know,

325
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.750
you tell the stores for years,

326
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:56.690
you tell these stories and sometimes I hear stories come back and go,

327
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.390
well that's just,
that's my story.
That's not how it went.
Yeah.

328
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:01.880
You'd tell the story or whatever.
Like the Ali Jo Prater story,

329
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.900
I'd hear the stories were like,
uh,

330
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.750
the Comey had that one because I've always seen his now he's now full.

331
00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:08.540
You guys listening.
He's a legendary comic from the comedy store.

332
00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:11.330
I believe it had a cowboy hat and the beer.
He was right.

333
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:16.040
He was doing the Larry the cable guy,
sort of country western comic before.

334
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.220
And I always read his first name is oily cause um,

335
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.980
I have like a learning disability or I'm just a moron.

336
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.080
And then someone finally said the name,
I'm like,
Oh shit.

337
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:27.200
That's how you say his name.
So that guy,
Gilbert Hertzog was his real name.

338
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:32.160
Gilbert hurts hardtalk heartsong and he went by Ali Jo Prater.
Ali Jo printed,

339
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.900
looked like Yosemite Sam.
He's a short guy,
was heavy at cowboy boots,

340
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:39.950
a cowboy hat,
you know,
he looked like a cartoon character and he was a classic,

341
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.220
may see back when these clubs started popping,
the places were packed.

342
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:47.600
They didn't need guys to draw.
They had packed,
they wanted guys to sell alcohol.

343
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.150
We were liquor pimps,
you know,
who sold the most.

344
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:53.970
And Allie Jo would drink on stage and the crowd would drink with him.

345
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.830
What would they pay you guys back then to have started escalating fast and then

346
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.920
you first go out,
they go,
you know,

347
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.060
it's an 800 bucks a week and then they want you back.

348
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.530
We want him back when he's other clubs wanting you.
So we'll pay it twice.
Twice.

349
00:18:06.531 --> 00:18:09.450
I went up by about 400 bucks 20 years later when I started.

350
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.110
That's what I loved in New York when we almost had that strike,
it was like,

351
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.700
it was 50 bucks for a weekend spot for like 2030 years,

352
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:19.920
50 bucks,
50 bucks in everything else up.

353
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:22.350
All the components were multimillionaires.
And finally we were like,

354
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.184
what the fuck?

355
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.180
And we asked for a hundred just knowing that we get like 75 and they completely

356
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:31.550
freaked out.
But uh,
anyways,
getting back to sort of escalating faster.
But,

357
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.970
but guys like Ali Jo word,
you know,
he was a real,
he sold you come in,
they go,

358
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.440
Ali Jo just sold like $13,000 worth of liquor last week.
And what was his style?

359
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:42.240
Was it?
So,
uh,
he was like

360
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.780
Larry the cable guy.
Foxworthy.
No,
he was blue.
He was little when he was,

361
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:51.150
and he was,
you know,
he would chug a beer.

362
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:54.660
I thought he'd started act by just like chugging a beer and going and then he

363
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:58.660
belch and you know,
that everything thing I learned in college,
oh chase us.

364
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.440
And so he set the tone early.
I would not want to follow that guy today.
He was,

365
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.960
and he,
and he would literally took anybody's act and there's an old line,

366
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.240
and I don't know who's lying this was,
but somebody wants,

367
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:11.580
says if Ali Jo came up and bought your beer,

368
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.540
I mean she just did one of your jokes and Ali Jo shared a joint with you.

369
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.320
He did a couple of your jokes if Ali Jo lead on Atlanta,
coke for you.

370
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.470
You just played Cleveland.
Yeah,
he didn't care.
And,

371
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.870
and I did,
it seemed like back then,
like certainly through like Vaudeville,

372
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:30.720
like people just taking other people's shit.

373
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.970
It was always seemed annoying,

374
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.510
but like it wasn't like the way it is now where it's just like,

375
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.560
it's like I don't post nine 11 like,
yeah,
why are you being hostile?

376
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:45.561
Like I remember seeing George Burns one time on 60 minutes or something and he

377
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.560
said,
you know,
yeah,
I used to do this bit,
Blah Blah,
blah,
blah blah.
You know,

378
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:52.340
he tells the joke,
he goes,
you know,
you know it's,
he goes,
dad.

379
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.810
I mean it's not a great joke.
I don't think melty would steal it.

380
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.860
And like he threw that out there on TV and years later I was just thinking like,

381
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:01.110
oh,
he's just ribbing.
And then years later when I became a comedian,

382
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:04.740
I was just like,
wow.
Like he really meant something by that.

383
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:06.280
And that guy must've been,
you know,

384
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.600
at least fucked with his act on some level that if he's,

385
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:14.030
that George Burns is on 60 minutes and fucking call somebody out for,

386
00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:17.550
for taking his shit.
So it didn't matter to him like it does now.

387
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.650
She did not see the Milton owned that it used to call him the thief,
a bed gags.

388
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.850
He owned it.
He,
he like,
he was like,
I,

389
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.470
I didn't steal this from where I stole that one.
Or they didn't care like we did.

390
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.850
Right.
They did worry about stealing her acts back involved.

391
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.730
[inaudible] they used to,

392
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.910
the only way to like prevent it was they would pay stage hands to protect their

393
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:36.151
acts.

394
00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:39.360
So if you came in and I just played there and then you came in and you start

395
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:44.340
doing my bits,
sandbag drops near you.
Oh Shit.
We like give you a warning.

396
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.070
You know,
they got like a heavy warning,
but then see that air

397
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.770
<v 2>chute you could get away with before cell phone cameras and stuff.</v>

398
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:53.020
You could literally deliberately drop it on the guy's head.

399
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:54.430
He dies and we know what happened to him.

400
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:58.130
We haven't shown up that fucking underneath the stage.
Wow.

401
00:20:58.131 --> 00:20:59.890
It changed the Lenny Bruce's time.

402
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.920
See before that the comics were just kind of Shtick,
you know,

403
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:04.430
and so you do some stick and it,

404
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.710
people were buying jokes and selling jokes and they were pretty interchangeable

405
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.510
from California.
Boy,
my arm's tired.
It was just all shit like that.

406
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.510
It didn't matter.

407
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.370
So when learning and those guys turned to make them what the comic said was

408
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:20.080
important,
it became artful and it mattered and you became tied the material.

409
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.530
So like what you said mattered and people wanted to believe that that was really

410
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:27.910
you.
It was really your opinion.
That was really your life.
Then it mattered.

411
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.570
Then you started taking things and it mattered.
Okay,
so when you come along,

412
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:34.390
I mean that's,
that's 25 years after Lenny Bruce.

413
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.650
The thing that it didn't matter with you guys was because there's no youtube,

414
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:41.530
there's none of that shit and you guys had just going up after poets and

415
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:42.400
strippers and stuff.

416
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:46.210
So once I got to just go up and survive or once I fucking got in the business

417
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:47.510
and mattered,
it started manner.

418
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.280
But there was so few comics we could police the community ourselves.
Right.

419
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.220
That's the difference.
You know,
like a guy became a thief.

420
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.580
He doesn't get to work the clubs,
he doesn't get the work that the AA rooms.

421
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.300
It was like when I start,
when I started in Boston,
dude,
if,
if you,

422
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.990
if you went over your time,
you went over your time and by over your time,

423
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:08.710
like at,
you know,
we told you to do 25 minutes,
you did 28,
28,

424
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:11.320
like you were in the fucking dog house.
Like,
dude,
what the,

425
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.710
you did three extra minutes.
Like,
like it was such a huge thing.

426
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:17.620
And forget about stealing jokes.
It like,

427
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.850
like I'm so fortunate that I started in Boston and all those Ding Ho guys,
like,

428
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:26.590
so set the bar so high that um,
if you are any hack,

429
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:29.900
if you like to rivet,
if they'd let you go for like two,
three years,

430
00:22:29.901 --> 00:22:33.640
zero k you're influenced by Gavlas Sweeney or a Nazi or something.

431
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.860
But then after that it was just like,
dude,

432
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.140
you need to come up with your own shit.
And,
but,

433
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:40.780
and it was one of those things like,
Boston's an unforgiving place.

434
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:45.690
So it's just like once you are labeled you,
if you had to leave.
So,
um,

435
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.330
see that's it.
That's it.
You got trained,
you got trained.

436
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.960
There's nobody doing that training anymore.

437
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.890
But you've got trained and that's how he did it involve built to the same sort

438
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:56.810
of things,
man.
They trained you,
they trained,
the guys would be coming up with,

439
00:22:56.811 --> 00:22:59.080
you'd have to learn to do it the right way or you wouldn't get any time.

440
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.620
What was the first like real comedy club?
Like a line,
like,
you know,

441
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:05.020
going up to auto,
but like you,
you work,
you felt like,

442
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.390
like when did all like those a room start coming up?
Like the punchlines,
the uh,

443
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.510
started around [inaudible] 82,
they all started,
you know,

444
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.340
there's some great rooms is started,
but a lot of these tunes they started,

445
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.170
I mean I wrote it in a book.
There's one like you go,

446
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.850
you're going to have to Minneapolis to play a room.

447
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:21.730
I'm going to play a place called Mickey fins now on these rooms rejected.

448
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.580
Just tool them together.
So I get out there and you know,

449
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:26.500
I felt like the gunslinger coming to town,

450
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:28.660
I'm like one of the first acts they bring in.
I'm from New York.

451
00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:31.090
I see all this guys.
Jeff's is Stereo Louie Anderson.

452
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:34.460
Ross standing in the back while bill bower or stand in the back.
I said that,
no,

453
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.380
there was a local comics there.
Those guys were all from Minneapolis,

454
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.130
Minnesota that are all back in room.
They're all staying.
I see.
I can see him.

455
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:45.100
You'll get him.
You go there.
They are there.
They go.
Their hair to check me out.

456
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.000
Right.
So I'm going to

457
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.800
<v 1>hit that stage man.
Hold on.
No,
I'm here man.
I'm going to rub their man.</v>

458
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:50.140
I'm going to rock star,
you know?
Right.

459
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.660
So I haven't checked anything out so I go running up and jump on the stage.

460
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.200
The stage was just a bunch of milk cartons,
right?

461
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.810
Real crates with a sheet of plywood on top.
God.
So I go fly.

462
00:24:00.811 --> 00:24:02.870
I just surfed the whole thing.
A whole thing just takes off.

463
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.680
I just go flying to go to a couple of tables,
hit the wall,

464
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.620
partially separate my shoulder,
jump up.
Like probably the biggest laugh.

465
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:12.260
You've got that huge.
They're like,
hey,
everybody's laughing at you.

466
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.610
They put the stage back in place and I did my set.
Oh my God.
So who else,

467
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.040
who else was a part of that Minneapolis scene that was a big names to Saturday

468
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.920
Anderson.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've been watching Louie on Zach.
He's great.

469
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.700
That's what I love about comedy is is there's sometimes is like,
dude,

470
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:30.350
you should do something with this person.

471
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.730
But who would ever would have thought that we should play Zach's dad and Zach

472
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:39.320
was a went to clown college in France and ends up in Bakersfield,

473
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:42.530
California.
I was talking to my wife about that last night.

474
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:46.700
We were laying in bed one than than the commercial came on for it and that just

475
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:50.780
like this is fucking like perfect casting together going like who to have like

476
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.180
night.
That's it in the way that they go back and forth.

477
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:55.430
It's like they've been working together for like 50 years.

478
00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:58.250
They're like an old comedy team and that's one of the things,

479
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.880
one of my favorite things as like a cause I eat despite how long I've been in

480
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:05.030
this business,
I've always just,
I've maintained that whole nerd,

481
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.600
sorta huge fan of,
um,
of stuff like that.
So,
um,

482
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.620
who is a guy that when you was in the early eighties,
like,
you know,

483
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:15.650
there's always those guys that,
you know,
when you start out,
you just like,

484
00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:18.140
there's no fucking way this person,
if this person doesn't make it,

485
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:20.960
nobody's going to make it like those guys and that you can be the worst manager

486
00:25:20.961 --> 00:25:22.910
in a world and you knew that someone was going to make it.

487
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:26.350
Do you remember seeing anybody like that?
Well,
you knew it.
This is,
you know,

488
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.450
a lot of guys don't realize it,
but you knew,
look it back.
He'd go like Leno,

489
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.240
Jay Leno,
you,
first time I saw him,
I go,
this guy's a killer.

490
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.180
I've always heard that.
I heard,
he's like mean just destroyed rooms.

491
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.840
He had the belt for like what,
15 years before he basically for it.

492
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.270
He had to do the tonight show every night.
Eh,
I mean,
you know,

493
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:44.270
I'd go into clubs and I'd be like,
I'd go in,
first thing I'd say is,

494
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.590
who's got the record?
Who's got the time,
you know,
who's done the longest here?
Eh,

495
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.350
this guide Clinton Hurst it out in 45.
It's done tonight.
It's over tonight.

496
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.550
You know,
I'm doing too easy,
you know,
and I'd go gun and for everybody.

497
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.690
And then I'd go into town and after Leno started working with clubs,

498
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.190
right when he started doing Letterman start pop a big,
you're going to go,

499
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.400
who's got the Jay Leno just did three hours,
three hours.

500
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:06.470
What did you lock the doors like Wagnerian opera,

501
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.870
what they do and hold the audience here at now you have four ovations.

502
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:12.140
They brought him back four times.
That's,
um,
and he still had the materials.

503
00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:14.000
That's what's always blown my mind about those people.
Like,
man,

504
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.570
that was a period where people were trying to like set the record and they'll go

505
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:19.760
on to stage for like seven,
eight,
nine hours.

506
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.180
I was just always pictured like eight hours in.
You just say,
Hey,

507
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:26.280
what's up with chairs?
You know,
it just like,

508
00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:29.650
like how do you still have at that point it's,

509
00:26:29.651 --> 00:26:33.130
it's just like you're just not getting that.
That's,
you know,

510
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.330
that's like world ray.
You might as well,
he's sitting on a fucking slag pull it.

511
00:26:36.331 --> 00:26:38.360
That's exactly excellent.

512
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:41.270
Kills me is somebody actually sat there and watched all of them.

513
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:44.160
There's a fucking,
you know,
two people left from the wait staff that have to stay

514
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.850
<v 2>there.
Yeah.
No this was,
but this was a legit show.
This was a legit show.</v>

515
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:50.300
Cause people were drinking and doing coke and they had,
they,

516
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.280
the crowd can hang right,
will legit this four to drunk driving laws change.

517
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:56.840
This is a little different.
What class were you from as far as like,

518
00:26:56.841 --> 00:26:59.250
so I know you were in New York.
How long were you in New York?

519
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.510
Belzer was the king in New York standup comedy back then to catch?
Yeah,
he was,

520
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:05.700
I mean,
you seem work.
That room catch,
he just owned it.

521
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.290
He just set the record for playing like a TV character for the longest time on a

522
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:11.280
show or something like that.

523
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:16.020
He said something and I remember being at Nick's comedy stop and the early

524
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.120
nineties and he was headlining and he was going,
yeah,
you know,

525
00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:21.550
they want me to do this,
uh,
this procedural show or something like that.
You know,

526
00:27:21.551 --> 00:27:23.520
when you think you can think it actually,
should I do it?
Should I do it?

527
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.080
I remember sitting in the back club going,
what the fuck is this guy asked us?

528
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.860
Of course you're going to do,
what should I be on TV?
Absolutely.

529
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.950
I didn't realize how much money he was making as a comedian,
but like,
uh,

530
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.540
that's kind of cool that I remember reading that like within like the last like

531
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.830
few weeks that he just said some fucking record for playing the same guy in the

532
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:44.700
same show since basically my entire standup career,
like almost last 25,

533
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.830
25 years.
It's been that long.
Yeah.
So you were a guy.
Yeah,
he was the guy,

534
00:27:49.831 --> 00:27:53.520
Gilbert Godfrey,
us all when he,
you saw him,
we were like that,
that he's the guy.

535
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.730
I mean I wouldn't,

536
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.990
I once watched him too many nights in row and went down to the East River and

537
00:27:57.991 --> 00:28:02.130
burned all my material burned on my notebooks.
Oh Geez.
Burned them all.
I said,

538
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:05.460
I'm just hack.
I've always told the story.
One of my favorite ones I ever saw him,

539
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:09.240
he went up at Nick's comedy stop one time in front of a bunch of fucking drunk

540
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.560
Boston morons and they were not getting him and he didn't waver at all.

541
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.400
He did his shit.
He had this little old man yellow sweater on.

542
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.000
And I remember one of his jokes cause all the comics were dying laughing and he

543
00:28:21.001 --> 00:28:23.640
was just bombing in front of this crowd.
I remember he goes,
yeah,

544
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:28.641
I went to a party the other night and I ran into Jackie Onassis and I said,

545
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:31.500
Jackie,
do you remember where you were?

546
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.870
And we're all dying laughing and nobody got it.
Nobody got the joke.

547
00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:40.590
And then he would just go onto the next one and do fucking dead,
like silence.

548
00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:44.970
And he toughed his way through that.
But,
uh,
first time I saw him,

549
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.810
I wasn't in the business was I saw him in one of the,
uh,

550
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.640
Beverly Hills cops movie that you were in Beverly Hills cop two.

551
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.440
What was that like?
Uh,
you know,
it's funny,
I mean,

552
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:57.120
I think I filmed for like four days for five seconds of screen time,

553
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.030
a couple of hours.
And it was fun.
It was hanging out,
you know,

554
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.540
it was that time when I saw it.
Wow.
This is the star Eddie,
Eddie Murphy.

555
00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:06.890
There was a scene where to go on.
All right,
Eddie.
Uh,
we've got a hold on man.

556
00:29:06.891 --> 00:29:09.310
We got changed some lighting and he goes,
I'm ready.
He goes,
yeah,
what?

557
00:29:09.311 --> 00:29:10.111
The director said,

558
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:12.690
hold on a minute and we'll get you meant so that he goes to me,
he goes,
come on,

559
00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:17.040
let's go.
So he goes,
grabs it like a bag of bread off the pref table,

560
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.580
and we'd go down to the playboy mansion.
So we just get out and starts feeding.

561
00:29:20.581 --> 00:29:24.060
The geese were just told bread to them.
So I'm about five,
10 minutes later,

562
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.490
one of the 80s comes.
There was Eddie there ready for you now?

563
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.730
And he just started to turn around and just keep seeding,
feeding them the geese.

564
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.870
Eddie,
we're ready.
We're ready.
He does.
He ignores him.

565
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.470
They leave to come back five minutes later anyway.
Are you ready now?

566
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.920
And he's just,
he made them wait.
They made him wait.
He made them wait.
Why should

567
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.700
<v 1>I go?
That's power.
That's the,
you know,
he's like the fucking balls.
That guy.</v>

568
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.100
I would never,
I would never,

569
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:52.840
I'd be like your how high jump.
Yeah.
Hat in hand.

570
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.460
I'll never get a no,
I've never understood like people that,
uh,
what's,

571
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:02.461
what's funny and tragic is watching people pulling those moves when they don't

572
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:06.520
have the power,
which I've seen a lot,

573
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:07.990
especially now,

574
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:11.890
where so many aspects of the entertainment business,

575
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:15.610
because of the Internet have just gone down the shit like the entire music

576
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:16.840
business.
You know,

577
00:30:16.841 --> 00:30:19.600
anybody nowadays who complains when we lose all the good music all sucks.

578
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:22.450
I always go,
well,
you get what you pay for.
I'm guilty of it too.

579
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:26.650
I I stole by Lyme wired a lot of shit.
I love color.
Yeah.

580
00:30:26.651 --> 00:30:31.420
A couple of fucking laptops that this got virus stout before somebody finally

581
00:30:31.421 --> 00:30:33.280
went like,
dude,
you're in this business,
you should pay for it.

582
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.770
Like I think it might've been Russman,

583
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.480
eve in New York said that to me and I haven't,

584
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.980
I haven't illegally downloaded a song or anything and like a dozen years way

585
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:46.870
back to like a Napster limewire was the last one that I use.
So,
um,
but anyways,

586
00:30:46.871 --> 00:30:50.230
yeah,
I've,
I've seen people like,
um,
try to pull that too.

587
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:54.370
You know who I am and all of that and the people who do that now it's just like,

588
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:54.581
dude,

589
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:58.600
you are not paying attention to this business where like remember like back in

590
00:30:58.601 --> 00:31:02.230
the day to try to get,
if they got like two major stars in a movie,

591
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.860
it was just like,
holy fuck,
this is going to be like a blockbuster.

592
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:09.460
Forget about now where like every movie is like Ocean's 11.

593
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.140
Like everybody got just bumped down.
Like,
like,

594
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.150
like the shit that I would go in and audition for in like the nineties you'll

595
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.140
have now a guy who like used to star and fucking movies,

596
00:31:20.141 --> 00:31:22.900
like B level movies is going and taking that spot.

597
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.630
All these stars are on TV and you just see these people pulling their moves.

598
00:31:25.631 --> 00:31:30.160
But um,
I,
I can't,
I mean that happens on a movie set.
Like it,

599
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:33.690
like the lighting isn't right.
It's a lot of waiting around.
I mean there,

600
00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:38.500
there's an entire crew film crew there,
people all over.
They had,

601
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.250
you know,

602
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:44.230
the scene was they were going to shoot Eddie just walking past a bunch of women

603
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.730
playing volleyball in Bikini's.
Right,
right.

604
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.030
So we get up to the scene and they start doing it and the,

605
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:54.460
and the director's yelling,
it goes jump higher,
girls jump higher,
jump higher.

606
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.850
He's trying to get jiggle gone.
And I see,
I go to Eddie Ego,

607
00:31:57.851 --> 00:32:01.840
there's too much dupont out their manager and Eddie,
cause I love you though.

608
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.500
Have goes what?
And he goes,
he tells me what he said,
director lady goes,
yeah,

609
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:08.890
you're right.
All right,
let's shoot the scene.
Forget it.
Oh,
it's all silicon man.

610
00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:13.020
Ain't no jiggling.
It happened now.
And how has Eddie handling,
uh,
I mean,

611
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:16.180
did you know Eddie before?
Yeah,
I know him from back in New York and a day.

612
00:32:16.181 --> 00:32:18.700
I mean the first time he came in the Improv I was,

613
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.880
I was the emcee on Sunday night.
I was like the regular,
when I was in town,

614
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.450
I was down in like 46 or 45th street on the west side.

615
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.770
It was all 44 44th and ninth.
Right.
Right there.
Yeah.

616
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.080
Cause I used to live in that neighborhood and we used to go down and uh,

617
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.400
I read this whole thing.

618
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:36.260
It might've been something I heard from you or something and now it's like it's

619
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.530
a pizza place or something.

620
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:41.990
And that's where Richard Pryor that it really raw video of him just standing

621
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.770
when he was stopped being the bill Cosby clone and he was turned into Richard.

622
00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:51.170
Like he literally was turning in to Richard Pryor the greatest of all time.

623
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:55.790
And like that always blew my mind that that was within like 15 blocks of where I

624
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:58.910
lived.
And I would go in there and get the pizza.
The pizza was only okay,

625
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.490
but I just wanted to be like see,
like see that wall.

626
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.400
We're just wondering where the fucking stage was.
Yeah.

627
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.340
Can I ask a total key question when you walked into that,

628
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.900
because it's basically the same space.
Where was the stage walk in

629
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.120
<v 2>the stage is all in the back of the room.
There was a,</v>

630
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:18.830
there was an emergency door exit right by the stage.
And the stage is a little,

631
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.710
you know,
was it all one room?
There was no walls.
You didn't watch it.

632
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.860
There's one room,
there was a bar,
there was a,
there was a bar out there.

633
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:27.380
Everybody hung out in a bar.
It was a good bar,
a cool bar.

634
00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:31.220
Everybody hung out there.
And then you'd walk through this little narrow,
narrow,

635
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:32.870
narrow hallway,
but short,
you know,

636
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.170
and the men's bathroom was on the right hand side of literally like a toilet and

637
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:39.290
a sink in,
in like a one of those little closets.

638
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.850
And then you'd walk in this little hall and the light was right there like by

639
00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:47.840
the service bar.
So if you're on stage and you see Rodney come to that light,

640
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.910
you know,
he goes,
danger fields here,
kind of get off,

641
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:52.050
got to get the Rodney on quick,
he's making around,

642
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.630
it's getting ready to do it tonight show or something.

643
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.030
So you see people's pop up into that light area.

644
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.940
Probably see his fucking silhouette to,
and you know who he was?
Oh yeah.

645
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:01.880
You just see him.
He just see me just,
he popped any,
as soon as you saw him,

646
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:04.490
he'd pop out and,
you know,
get up Rodney.
I was like,

647
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:07.700
because I saw the Rodney and I was on the stage.
I'd cut mid joke,
you know,

648
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.440
and then that,
hey,
we've got a special guest here.
Right?

649
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.080
I remember Cologne.
I remember going off and Rodney coming on because,
hey,

650
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:17.660
you know how to fucking move.
The kid now has a,
and he moves,

651
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.860
he knows how to move.
That's okay.

652
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.500
<v 1>Awesome man.
You know,
I liked it and it just reminded me one time I did,
uh,</v>

653
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.120
I did a benefit at this theater and a beacon beacon theater.

654
00:34:28.121 --> 00:34:29.680
I forget what the hell,
the goddamned benefit,
what's,

655
00:34:29.681 --> 00:34:31.990
what was the sickest lineup I was ever on?
It was a,

656
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:37.360
John Stewart was hosting Max Weinberg Bard,
his band,
Tony Bennett goes on first,

657
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.070
then Bruce Springsteen,
then they auctioned off one of his guitars,

658
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.480
uh,
to this rich crowd that goes for like a hundred grand.

659
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.220
Then fucking Joe Mchale had to follow that.

660
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.470
Like I tell my accounts.
Got It.
He has to have the,
I followed fucking story.

661
00:34:53.471 --> 00:34:57.700
Right.
Um,
and then I went up after him,
which,
you know,

662
00:34:57.701 --> 00:35:00.250
he was the total buffer to get it back to,
all right.

663
00:35:00.251 --> 00:35:04.300
Settle down your expectations.
This is what you paid for here.
Right.

664
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.390
And Seinfeld was closing.
That was the lineup.

665
00:35:07.391 --> 00:35:09.940
And I remember when I was doing my set,

666
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.340
I was conscious about not being too dirty because I mean,

667
00:35:12.341 --> 00:35:15.040
Seinfeld's like the king.
And I remember looking over,

668
00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:18.880
I was getting close to the end of my set and he was standing on the side of the,

669
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:23.890
the,
uh,
the stage and you know,
the light was behind him.
So he was like back lit.

670
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.500
And I knew who he was with his silhouette,

671
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:29.890
like that's how famous this guy is and to me,

672
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.620
and it wasn't just Jerry hanging out,
he had the suit on,

673
00:35:32.621 --> 00:35:36.820
it was Jerry ready to go to work.
And I was immediately thinking like,
oh my God,

674
00:35:36.821 --> 00:35:40.770
am I too blue?
Is he going to hate me?
And My pissing them off,
am I going over?

675
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.120
And I remember when I got off stage he went like,
uh,

676
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.210
I walked by him and I was just,
I was just,
I was almost afraid to say hello.

677
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:50.880
I just like walked by an east wind.
Very funny,
very funny.

678
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.140
And then I apologize for working.
You know the way I do,
I said,

679
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.300
oh sorry of above line.
He goes high and I don't care.
Almost like laugh.

680
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:59.610
Like dude,
I don't give a shit.
And I'm thinking like,
that's right.

681
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:03.720
This guy always worked clean and he worked cleaned before there was even comedy

682
00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:04.290
clubs.

683
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.400
So I can't imagine him going on after these guys who would chug a beer and then

684
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:10.740
burp and be like,
that's what I learned in college.

685
00:36:10.741 --> 00:36:12.840
And like that sort of energy is fun,

686
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.960
but it whips him into like this frog frat boy frenzy and then you got to go up

687
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:21.030
there and if you have like a more of a,
you know,

688
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.980
just straight laced kind of like,
yeah,

689
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:24.360
I mean I have a beer every once in a while,

690
00:36:24.361 --> 00:36:27.150
but guys like I'm not letting this totally affect my life,
you know.

691
00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.460
<v 2>Well first of all,
I love the fact that you did that.
That's the training.</v>

692
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.990
Got in Boston and go,
I'm part of the show.

693
00:36:32.991 --> 00:36:36.290
I know I'm not closing someone to respect the headliner.
Oh,

694
00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:37.124
you know how it works.

695
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.520
<v 1>Oh,
that was another,
that was another way that you would get,</v>

696
00:36:39.521 --> 00:36:43.370
you would get blackballed.
I remember,
uh,
there was a comedian up there,

697
00:36:43.371 --> 00:36:46.990
a Mike Donovan.
You ever worked with them?
I know who he is.
Fucking hilarious guy.

698
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:49.870
And he used to always say this thing was hilarious and it'd be like,

699
00:36:49.871 --> 00:36:53.260
it'd be like,
yeah,
just go out there,
uh,
you know,
do like 20 minutes.
Say No.

700
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.880
Keep it like,
you know,
three of five fucks is,
what do you say it is?
The thing,

701
00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.280
he wasn't bullshitting.
He was like,
people in Boston counted the fucks.

702
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:08.410
So I remember,
uh,
you know,
sometimes going over it and being in a panic like,

703
00:37:08.411 --> 00:37:09.220
oh my God,

704
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:13.210
that was my sixth fuck Donovan's going to call Mike Clark and I'm going to be,

705
00:37:13.211 --> 00:37:17.250
I'm going to be ruined in this town.
I said fuck six times.
So,
um,

706
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.170
I mean I don't want to sit there and be like the old guys and just cause I don't

707
00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:23.100
know what it is like for kids coming up now in mind.

708
00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:28.180
It's the kids to me now or anyone up to like 32,
33,
um,
coming up now.

709
00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:31.380
But I'm sure that they have their,
uh,
their whole way

710
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.070
<v 2>that all it always change it.
But I liked that.
But you know,</v>

711
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.480
Seinfeld always had that discipline.

712
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:40.220
I remember working with him and then he's Jersey gigs.
Jersey gigs were like $55.

713
00:37:40.221 --> 00:37:41.080
Jersey gave this started.

714
00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.300
There was like the first paying gigs we could get go out to Jersey and some bar.

715
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.940
Right.
And so,
you know,
it's survival time in a bar.

716
00:37:46.941 --> 00:37:49.260
It's a lot of guys would be like,
what do I gotta do to get by,
you know,

717
00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.570
fuck with a Crown Shit Dick Jokes.
What have I got to do to get by?
Right.

718
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.610
And I remember working with Jerry on time and he goes on and he'd follow that

719
00:37:58.611 --> 00:38:03.410
and he stays right to what he's doing.
Man Works Clean.
Brings him to him.
No,

720
00:38:03.411 --> 00:38:06.020
but he wasn't killing it does not like at all.
They don't came to him.

721
00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:08.210
They were like,
oh wait,
wait.
The party's over it.
It wasn't great.

722
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.770
But he never broke.
He never wavered.
And afterwards I go,
wow man.
He goes,
he goes,

723
00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:15.680
I'm getting ready to do it tonight shows.
That's what I'm preparing it though.

724
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.930
He had the folks had the Longreach focus.
He was like,

725
00:38:17.931 --> 00:38:21.080
I'm practicing this material here now cause I'm going to do to some of the

726
00:38:21.081 --> 00:38:23.480
tonight show.
Right.
I'm working this out now.

727
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.240
I'm not worried about my $55 Jersey Gates.
Well he's one of those guys,

728
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:31.030
a long range view.
He's one of those guys that he just fucking knew where he,

729
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:36.070
he that's,
he just knew where he was going and he just a,
you'll

730
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.620
<v 1>never meet a guy that doesn't suffer fools the way he does.</v>

731
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.760
I still want to get around them.
I get nervous.
I'm like,

732
00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.720
I'm going to say one stupid thing and this guy's going to,

733
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.120
I'm going to get that look and that's just going to be,

734
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.490
you'll try the local lake the same way.

735
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:51.820
Like his act is the way he lives his life.
There's no fat,

736
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.490
there's no extra words or any of that type of shit.

737
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:58.830
And then the guy just fucking,
just like,
he just walks towards what he wants,

738
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.400
walks right through it.
I mean,
not,
not like in a malicious way,
just like he just,

739
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.940
I on the fucking prize,
that guy you'll get back in the day guys would go like,

740
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.120
you know,
and I'm like,
is that because you don't really know who he is up there?

741
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:12.880
Go,
Oh,
you fucking paying attention.
You know?
Exactly.

742
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.060
You know what pissed this guy off the missing sock and a fucking dryer.

743
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.510
That's who he is.
Man,
I just paid attention.

744
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:22.720
He's fucking paying attention to the details.
That's what's irritating.
This guy,

745
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.720
I did his web series one time and I told him that.
I told them I hate it,

746
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:28.480
that they said his show is a show about nothing.
It's like,
no it isn't.

747
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:33.810
This guy has contempt for 90% of people and activities.

748
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.250
I was actually nervous saying it to him and he laughed and he goes,

749
00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:40.360
I think you're being generous by saying that you know that it's only 9.9% yeah.

750
00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:45.190
But it's uh,
um,
that's so fucking cool.
So when did like,
uh,

751
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.630
Oh God,
there's so many things I want to ask you this as far as,
so the Improv,

752
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:53.200
the Improv started in New York City and then they opened the La one,
right?

753
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.470
Cause they open the la one because he realized everything was moving out to la.

754
00:39:56.471 --> 00:40:00.580
When Johnny moved,
when Carson moved,
that was that when he moved to the 72,

755
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:03.760
the whole thing shifted.
The axis shifted,
right.

756
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:07.540
Everybody had to go out to La and the comedy store just opened then.

757
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.560
So comedy store became people going on the tonight show going,
yeah,

758
00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:16.000
I work out at the comedy store in La.
That became the place.
Wow.
Right.
So,

759
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:19.030
but he's like,
I got to get out there.
And then the,

760
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.500
cause he wasn't getting the brand recognition and no,

761
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.340
he was getting at when he's in New York and the comics would go on the tonight

762
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:27.250
show in New York and go,
I work out at the Improv here in New York,

763
00:40:27.251 --> 00:40:31.180
like Klein or those comics.
But then it shifted,
immediately shifted.

764
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:33.460
That's why Leno went right out to la.
I know Saul,

765
00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.670
Freddie Prinze go on the tonight show and say,

766
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:38.350
I'm working at the comedy store and Leno goes,

767
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.270
I got to get out to the comedy store.
Right.

768
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:46.350
And so the franchise didn't start opening until the eighties like 84 when Mark

769
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.850
Anderson opened one in San Diego.
Then that started,

770
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:51.830
he started opening up those men that franchise did bud light,

771
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.560
bud franchised it out.
When he saw the whole boom happened,

772
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.030
that's when he made money.
That's when he really made money.

773
00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.040
Mark Anderson Open these clubs and bud was making huge,

774
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.180
it's like the Trump thing.
I've heard a lot of that stuff that says Trump on it.

775
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.040
They're paying for the name for the name.
That's so smart.

776
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.340
So bud was getting like a gross of every club.

777
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:12.520
I think I got to answer because like I,
you know,

778
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.640
you're doing the tonight show with Johnny Carson,

779
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:19.930
which has to be the most nerve wracking.
Huge possible thing.

780
00:41:19.931 --> 00:41:23.020
Like sleepless nights and like,
yeah.
What,
what,
what year did you,

781
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.060
did you first do 84 you did an ATF.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

782
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.630
So you're going to go on there.
I mean it's just at that point it's,

783
00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.210
it's w that show,
like I,
I feel bad for young people.

784
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:35.750
They don't understand how huge that fucking show was.
It was just like,
it was,

785
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.380
it was everything.
Everyone's was the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan.

786
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:43.250
It was our standup comic.
It was everything.
It was everything.
So you,

787
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:47.150
they tell you you're getting the show,
so you must be like over the moon excited.

788
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:51.650
And then for me,
what would immediately hit would be the dread of like,
Oh fuck,

789
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:56.651
now I have to do this and I have to somehow compartmentalize the fucking terror

790
00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.870
of this guy who can either invite me over,

791
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.940
gave me the old K or all of my peers are going to see that he didn't like me

792
00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:09.260
because I watch that shit.
So everybody watched it.
Yeah.
So here's a deal,

793
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:12.440
how it worked,
and correct me if I'm wrong here,
he would give you,

794
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.010
what would he give you?
The,
okay,
he didn't call you either call you all,

795
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:18.530
but that was the highest.
That's it.
Oh,
you got the,
okay,

796
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.850
so he's still coming back,
which is accepted for the first time.
You'll know.

797
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.920
But then there was the one where he would just be like,

798
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.510
they'll do drumming his pencil on the table.
Oh,

799
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.890
you take his pencil and just drumming it and not looking at you.

800
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.420
And that was like it,
man.
That was the worst.
And he knew he was,

801
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.330
he knew what he was doing to the comic cut that day.
I read it.

802
00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:39.680
I read that book that his lawyer read.

803
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:44.681
I mean how ice cold his mother was like the ability to do that.

804
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:48.080
It's like that's the trickle down effect.
Um,

805
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.430
I'll tell you how I dealt with doing Letterman because Letterman was my Carson.

806
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.800
Like I literally had to,

807
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.520
I was so fucking like thinking what am I gonna do?

808
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:02.780
I had to like work up like a healthy level of hatred cause that's just how I'm

809
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:03.950
wired.
I'd be like,
yeah,

810
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.060
fuck this guy for making me so fucking them name is a great guy.
Came over,

811
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.620
shook my hand and everything.
But like I had to literally be thinking,

812
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:13.910
fuck this guy and then to go out there.
So I went out there and I had,

813
00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:17.390
thank God I had a great set and I remember like you see it on TV and you think

814
00:43:17.391 --> 00:43:20.030
he's fucking 80 yards this way and the band's a hundred yards.

815
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.500
They're all right there.

816
00:43:21.501 --> 00:43:25.020
Like you could take two steps over and shake Paul's hands,
another three.

817
00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:25.711
You could shake days.

818
00:43:25.711 --> 00:43:30.711
And I remember doing my set hearing Dave laugh and it was such a fucking,

819
00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:34.160
it was more relief.
It's like,
oh my God,
he's laughing.

820
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.890
And he's the last one that was,
you know,
your and get married.

821
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:39.110
So it was like in the wheelhouse cause he wasn't married or anything like that

822
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:40.070
is,
it was just,
I don't,

823
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:44.690
I just remember thinking like I was so fucking relieved when it was over.
Matt.

824
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.621
I was just so relieved.

825
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:48.530
So tell me what that was it but it sorta a Letterman show,

826
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.140
let her room's always behind you on camera.
So the orange could,

827
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.540
you were let him go.
It was in the sight line.

828
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.700
So they're looking at UNC and let them run over your shoulder.

829
00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.280
So if you'd have let them and laugh and you could die.
Oh Wow.
You know,

830
00:44:00.281 --> 00:44:04.480
so by the time I,
it,
they didn't have like,
he was,
he was already over at cvs.

831
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:09.700
I'm talking about the NBC show.
Okay.
So anyway,
84 I was in New York because,

832
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.980
uh,
I left the summer Olympics were out here and I've said,

833
00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:14.720
I'm going to get out of La,
this,
it's going to be a mess.

834
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.840
And so Kennison and I booked over to New York for the summer and I was there and

835
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:22.430
I was working out and Jim Mccauley,
the tonight show,

836
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.190
booker saw me in New York and said,
said,
you're ready man.

837
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.850
Want to do it in two weeks.
It was all just so you know,

838
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.980
did you cobble this block?
People don't understand.
It's

839
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.230
<v 2>a very unnatural set back then.
I don't know how to do it down.</v>

840
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:36.750
Maybe they just pull five minutes out of the rack and tack on five.

841
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.200
But you pull like a greatest hits thing.
You pull a joke from this bit,

842
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:44.100
you pull and you cobbled together with,
he's weird.
Segways right.
You know,

843
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.200
you do a skiing waterskiing joke,
then you go,

844
00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:47.670
you know when you come out and water,
your hair's messed up.

845
00:44:47.671 --> 00:44:52.260
You know when I get my haircut and it was like torture.
Oh,

846
00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:56.850
it's horrible.
Yeah.
And uh,
so I,
I put this set together,
you know,

847
00:44:56.851 --> 00:44:59.590
that he helped me with and then I'm practicing it every night.
You know,

848
00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.940
just going into clubs every night.
Then many times I could run out to Jersey Gig,

849
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:05.580
coming back to him,
a bunch of monitoring it while you're brushing your teeth,

850
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.980
the whole fucking thing.
Completely freaking out.

851
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.910
And I was drinking and doing a lot of blow back then.
So I was like,

852
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:15.630
I got to quit.
I've got to quit.
So week before I thought I'd just,

853
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.960
I'm not going to drink and do drugs.
You high when they told you you got the Gig?

854
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.910
Oh yeah.
We went out to a bar afterwards.

855
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:22.620
Mccullough and I went out to a bar when he says,
you got it,

856
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:25.140
let's go talk about it.
We went out to a bar drinking.

857
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:27.980
I didn't do blow in front of him cause I didn't know whether he did it or not.

858
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:32.910
I wasn't going to risk that,
you know,
but we were drinking.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.
And uh,

859
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:36.740
I got so stressed out,
I got shingles,
I broke out in shingles.
Oh my God.
You know,

860
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.290
by my,
my ass and my leg would just blistered up and I didn't know what,

861
00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:43.440
there wasn't,
went to the doctor.
He said you got shingles,
man.
Yeah,

862
00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:45.210
you got shingles.
That's an old man's thing.
What do you,

863
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:47.720
what are you stressed out about something?
Yeah.
Let me see.
Yeah,

864
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.160
I'm doing it tonight.
Shit.
Then he'd probably be like,
wait,
what is it?
Oh yeah,

865
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.910
you answer the stress because now I know you're watching and you're going to be

866
00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:56.170
at home going like,
and it's funny,
I got shit.

867
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.040
He got blisters on his ass.
Wow.
Yeah.

868
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.790
And so you're standing backstage,
right?
So this is Burbank,

869
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:08.130
obviously before the shooting of Burbank.
So there's,

870
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.520
the fucking curtain was iconic and that fucking gold and blue and weird ass,

871
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:17.310
all those weird colors.
All I could think about was fucking up.
I mean,
literally,

872
00:46:17.311 --> 00:46:19.380
I'm like going,
I can't fuck up.

873
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.370
You don't think about how much fun you're going to have.
I didn't think like,
oh,

874
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:27.510
I'm going to it.
This is going to be fun,
man.
I earned this.

875
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.840
I deserve this.
I'm going to go out and go in and have a good time and say,

876
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:33.000
what's up Johnny?
You're not just like,
yeah,
yeah.

877
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.670
Did you have the panic thought of what if I,
what if I forget where I am?

878
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:36.930
What if I forget what I'm saying?

879
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.830
Cause at that then that did not happen to somebody say happened to me or my HBO

880
00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:45.780
special.
I blanked on my HBO special.
Oh God.
For how long?

881
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.220
When I had to stop taping,
I just want,
I,
I'm lost.

882
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.770
I'm lost because it was getting,

883
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:56.520
it was now instead of a five minutes unnatural to cobble together a half hour

884
00:46:56.521 --> 00:47:00.720
out of like hours and material and posted that,
you know,
like just all together,

885
00:47:00.721 --> 00:47:02.730
just kind of just cut and paste,
cut and paste.

886
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.460
And I was practicing that for a long time and I got out there and I just went,

887
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.000
what am I doing?
What the,
you know,

888
00:47:07.001 --> 00:47:09.000
it was like one of those things where you're going,
what the fuck am I doing?

889
00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:12.460
It was almost like biff from death of a salesman.
What am I going to ask?

890
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:13.710
Contemptuous bid here.

891
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.310
What happens is you go out there and rather than just doing a show,

892
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.820
you know you're being watched and then you start watching yourself and then you

893
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:23.610
leave yourself and then you're sitting in the crowd going,

894
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.100
why is he moving his arm like that?
Cause you're literally thinking,
oh I'll do,

895
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:29.870
we've all fucking bed.
Yeah.

896
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.790
So when you're standing behind that curtain and you just,
and just,

897
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.920
if adrenaline was unbelievable,
it was unbelievable.

898
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:38.590
Then you walk out and then you hit it.
And as soon as,

899
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.090
but it's like every other time,

900
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.570
I mean my literally my mind went blank like every time before I go on stage,

901
00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:47.080
my mind goes blank.
I if you go,
what jokingly?
What joke?
I don't have any jokes.

902
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.800
I can't remember anything.
Yeah,
totally blank.
Right.
And walk out there,
dude.

903
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:53.680
At first joke,
get the first laugh and go.
Yeah,

904
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.310
you're locked in that first laugh and you're locked in.
So you went out,

905
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.250
you did your first joke.
Yeah.
How did it do?
Good laugh.

906
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:03.340
You got to go to the land and you know when you're doing it,
you're plan it.

907
00:48:03.341 --> 00:48:05.860
Everybody says the first joke is just them seeing you and hearing you for the

908
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:08.560
first time.
So don't expect the big laugh so you don't put your,
you know,

909
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:13.330
you know,
I was just told the three jokes in,
that's your first killer joke,

910
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.510
right?
You know,
three jokes in that should be your first kill joke.

911
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:17.650
That's how you kind of planned it.

912
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.280
I know all these fucking guys with their ideas and then the fifth joke,

913
00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:26.200
she'd be this more shit to think about it.
So natural.
It's on that now.

914
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:29.410
So it was unnatural.
You go out there and you end up,
you end up having had this,

915
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:32.500
I would really good set and have a really good set set.
You'll now you're like,

916
00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:35.970
how long did it feel to look over at Johnny?
Like fuck,
oh no,

917
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.290
I'm going to lock eyes with this God that looked over big smile,
you know,

918
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.300
big smile and a circle finger like you said,
like big.
Okay.
And I go,

919
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:47.800
oh can I came backstage and Jim Mccauley greets me.
I got a beer,
hands me a beer.

920
00:48:47.801 --> 00:48:50.320
I was great.
Fantastic man.
To stand over here.

921
00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.310
Stand over here at the end of the show.

922
00:48:51.311 --> 00:48:53.350
You staying here and when Carson walks back,

923
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:56.110
the way he walks back a re after every show,

924
00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:00.190
this route he takes backstage,
you're going right there on the route.
He stopped,

925
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:03.270
shakes your hand.
That was great.
Get a photo op.
Fantastic.

926
00:49:03.271 --> 00:49:05.500
You going to come back soon?
You can come back.
So yeah,
I've got a picture.

927
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:08.530
You know you had a picture and you're just standing there going,
okay.

928
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:13.270
And then he was fantastic and moves on,
right?
And you're like,

929
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.991
this is it.

930
00:49:13.991 --> 00:49:18.670
Then you go back and the Improv that night and on Melrose in West,
uh,

931
00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:22.480
you know,
West Hollywood,
right?
Everybody was there.
They turn the TV up.

932
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.790
Everybody in the bar standing there.
You're standing there.

933
00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:27.430
That's what kills me about how they redid that and I didn't get the bar
upstairs.

934
00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.290
It's like all,
all that history,
you guys,

935
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.500
all those people had stood there watching their friends tonight show set.

936
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.170
Everybody who leaned on that fucking bar kills me.
At least they didn't.

937
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.430
They didn't demolish.

938
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:38.650
And John and John used to say the same thing when a new comic,

939
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:41.940
I'm glad you're in a good mood tonight because we've got a new comic coming on,

940
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.360
right.
And the comics would mouth it and,

941
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.660
and some would actually say it out loud with Johnny.

942
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:51.280
That's how much everybody knew that.
Wow.
That that routine.
Right,

943
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.790
right.
And you just stand there and it's like,
Yay.

944
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:56.740
And I already saw how much bloated you do that night when you're going to

945
00:49:56.741 --> 00:49:58.870
fucking pass that Jesus Christ.

946
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.750
I had coke in my pocket when I walked out on the set that day.

947
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.150
That's how much I knew.
I was like,
when you watch Ron,

948
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:10.490
like fucking a Ron Burgundy and all those fucking movies that,

949
00:50:10.491 --> 00:50:13.450
that look more like a documentary to you then rather than a comedy.
It's like,

950
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:16.320
yeah,
we did all that.
I had a suit like that.
I wore that on the tonight show.

951
00:50:16.321 --> 00:50:20.980
I had blow in my pocket.
Yeah.
Wow,

That's fucking amazing.
Well,

952
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.240
we got a,

953
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:25.570
I got to run back to the stomach in the middle of editing this fucking cartoon

954
00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:27.880
that's never going to end.
Dude.
I gotta tell you,

955
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.790

I would,
I hope people listening as much fun as I did.

957
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:37.280
Like I could ask you a Zillion,

958
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:41.600
how do you not talk to a guy who fucking had coke in his pocket when he does the

959
00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:45.800
fucking tonight show?
You're like,
I'm doing this either way.

960
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:49.070
This is either gonna make me super happy or make me want to fucking kill myself.

961
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:51.560
So his book is called kicking through the ashes.

962
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:55.270
My life was a standup in the 1980s comedy boom.

My son's angry.

Three shout and uh,

if you tried Lyft,
um,
you know what I mean?
What with lifts,

1002
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:32.820
you just download the APP request to driver and they show up in three and a half

1003
00:53:32.821 --> 00:53:35.070
minutes.
On average.
That's really fast,
man.

1004
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:39.060

1010
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:57.380
I mean,

uh,

1011
00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:01.170

It's just a better all around experience.
Bigger isn't always better.

1013
00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.140
Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

1014
00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:09.420
but it's the fastest growing and highest rated one.

1015

A lot of people are actually getting rid of their cars.

1019
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.080
Is that true in relying on Lyft to get around down there?

1020
00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:28.950
Just talking shit here and you know what?

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:11.050
<v 5>I don't know.
Was Bad.
Got to keep</v>

1080
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:20.310
playing patty cake with some mistletoe and a sleigh.

1081
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.440
Santa Claus has an itchy beard and big black boots sit in his lab.

1082
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:39.250
I don't know why.
I can't say merry Christmas.

1083
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:40.780
Somewhere along the line.

1084
00:58:40.781 --> 00:58:45.781
It became offensive even though I don't mean anything bad by

1085
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:52.660
some Mexican came up to you and said,

1086
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:54.910
happy Cinco de my,

1087
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.780
what'd you say?
Dude?
What the fuck and fuck.

1088
00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:03.520
It's all just April to me.

1089
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.950
<v 6>Doo Doo,
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo</v>

1090
00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:13.120
<v 5>friends.
It's that time of year again.</v>

1091
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.810
<v 6>Ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh.</v>

1092
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:21.090
<v 5>When the fuck did you know saying merry Christmas.
Become offensive,
blah,
blah,</v>

1093
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.880
buy,
buy,
buy,
buy,
buy,
buy.
You know,

1094
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:29.010
I don't understand that shit.
Just cause I say it that,
you know,

1095
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.540
it's like if somebody Jewish said Happy Hanukkah to me,
I,
you know,

1096
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:37.250
I wouldn't be like,
you know what the fuck dude,
blah blah blah blah blah,
blah,

1097
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:42.260
blah,
blah.
You know what the fuck?
I don't understand that.

1098
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.310
I like to say merry Christmas makes me feel good.
Makes you feel good.
Right?

1099
00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:47.600
My chest.
A little warm feeling just like the Grinch,

1100
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:52.000
you know when his little heart kind of broke out of that little box.
Doo Doo,

1101
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:56.630
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
This is a little a holiday break down is a,

1102
00:59:56.631 --> 01:00:01.490
as I as I kick knowledge about the holidays,
um,

1103
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.900
whatever.
So have yourselves a merry little Christmas.
He is,

1104
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.680
I don't hate Muslims or Jews.

1105
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:11.990
When I say merry Christmas.

1106
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.240
So whatever group he's walking around saying it's offensive,

1107
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:21.710
go fuck yourself.
Then you'll fucking con.
Even if you're male,

1108
01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:26.711
you have a con because you've ruined part of my holiday.

1109
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:31.490
I would never do that to you.
All right,
that's enough.

1110
01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:35.030
Jesus Christ.
Sorry.
You know.
Anyways,
how are you?

1111
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.340
I know I'm tone deaf,
but you know,

1112
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.420
I told you I was going to brace the holidays this year and I was at the airport

1113
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:46.421
coming back from a Vancouver listen to this week that I had.

1114
01:00:46.671 --> 01:00:48.740
First of all,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

1115
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.050
Usually if I'm going to sing badly,
I only do it for a couple of seconds spot.
Uh,

1116
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:58.560
you know,
I don't know.
I just saw can,
I kind of felt it.
Um,

1117
01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:00.980
and I was just in Canada and they say merry Christmas up there,

1118
01:01:00.981 --> 01:01:05.630
which makes me feel good because you know what,
that's what I say.
You know,

1119
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:10.010
do I have to go to Canada now?
They listened to somebody say merry Christmas.

1120
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.680
I don't know what the fuck are these?
How big are these groups?

1121
01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:16.820
I think you just need like literally 18 people and they just,
you know,

1122
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:21.380
they just hold up signs and they talk,
Oh,
what the fuck?
What the fuck?

1123
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.150
And the way they frame it on the news,

1124
01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:27.890
they make it look like it's a zillion people.
You know?
I,
you know,
I don't know.

1125
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.530
It's weird.
I'm trying to think if I ever said Merry Christmas to the,

1126
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.510
to a friend of mine who's Jewish and he ever got offended.

1127
01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:39.800
I don't think they ever did
so want,
so what?

1128
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:42.710
18 Una t me of friends get offended by the shit.

1129
01:01:42.711 --> 01:01:46.040
And then you get to call yourselves a group and then you get to start walking

1130
01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:49.220
around telling people what's offensive and what isn't it?
These are the holidays.

1131
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:53.150
You can't,
unless you're fucking open your hearts to another religion.

1132
01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.970
All right.
So anyways,
um,

1133
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.730
listen to this fucking week that I had.
All right,

1134
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:05.120
you want to talk about busy cause my brain is going to be all over the place.

1135
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.550
I'm already telling you that.
All right?

1136
01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:11.860
And I might even sing another holiday fucking song if I feel like,
um,

1137
01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:15.500
a pill.
Nobody's saying he can,
you know,
I don't understand the hostility.

1138
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.140
Why don't you relax,
okay.
You just got back from the airport.

1139
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:21.630
You haven't showered,
you know,
he should have taken a little bit of time,

1140
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.550
showered,
you know,

1141
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:28.080
treated yourself and gotten yourself in a mindset where you could relax a little

1142
01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:30.510
more and do a happier podcast.
But you didn't,

1143
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.160
you ordered a grilled cheese sandwiches,

1144
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:36.150
some chicken noodle soup and you fucking went right in wearing the clothes that

1145
01:02:36.151 --> 01:02:39.780
you've been sitting in since last night at the Canuck game and now you're laying

1146
01:02:39.781 --> 01:02:44.130
on your bed.
That's disgusting.
Um,
anyways,
this is my week.

1147
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:48.150
See what I did.
I just talk myself down.
Fight more calmer tone.

1148
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.680
You like this.
This is the new me.
This isn't the new me.

1149
01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:54.000
This is the guy I'm trying to be.

1150
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:58.200
This is the person I think I was before a bunch of fucked up shit happened to me

1151
01:02:58.201 --> 01:03:01.740
and became me.
This make me become like a screaming maniac that I am.

1152
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.850
So I'm trying to get back in touch to me.
Circa 1972,

1153
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:11.280
um,
anyways,
um,
this is my week.
Monday

1154
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.430
I saw,
uh,

1155
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.700
I flew back from New York City after a wonderful engagement at Caroline's comedy

1156
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:22.530
club.
And,
uh,
I landed,

1157
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:28.100
I had a sandwich and then me and three of my friends all went down to the La

1158
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.590
Forum.
We saw ACDC that was Monday,
you know,

1159
01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.910
most people would call it a fucking week right there and be like,
wow,

1160
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.330
I just saw one of the most legendary rock bands of all time.

1161
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:45.180
Brian Johnson's voice sounded unbelievable.

1162
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.670
He looked like he was having the time of his life.

1163
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.630
Angus was still jumping around and I'm sick of people on this tour going and
you,

1164
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.520
you know,
anger,
see,
you know,
he's great,
but you know,
he kinda,
he kinda,

1165
01:03:56.521 --> 01:03:59.430
he's Kinda lost a step.
It's like,
dude,
so have you.

1166
01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.990
I don't understand how people feel like,
you know,

1167
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:08.460
they look at famous people like they're not supposed to age.
You know,

1168
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:09.350
and you know,
if,

1169
01:04:09.351 --> 01:04:13.860
if people fucking videotaped you taking out your trash seven years ago,

1170
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.720
the last time ACDC was on tour,

1171
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.540
I bet you don't have such a big spring and you'll fucking step either.

1172
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:22.980
Stop making fun of Angus,
the guy jumping around at 53 years of age.

1173
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:27.480
Never missing a nope.
Try doing that at 16.
Tried doing the shit that he does.

1174
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.310
I dare you to try that on your fucking you little playstation game,
Guitar Hero.

1175
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:36.210
You think you could do that for an hour and a half and then do a strip tease and

1176
01:04:36.211 --> 01:04:38.700
moon the crowd and then come right back in.

1177
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:42.360
Jump off a fucking drum riser and be right on the fucking one.

1178
01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:46.770
I don't think you could do that.
Leave Angus alone.
They were the shit.

1179
01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.090
That was my Monday.
Right?
And then,
um,

1180
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:56.040
Tuesday I began three straight,

1181
01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:59.130
12 hour days shooting my pilot for comedy central,

1182
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.530
which could not have gone better.
I think a,

1183
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.350
we got a lot of fucking hilarious stuff.
Um,
I'm in a very smart move.

1184
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:12.120
I pulled the Seinfeld,
I learned a lot from Jerry Seinfeld,
you know,
he,
uh,

1185
01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:12.630
you know,

1186
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:16.140
what did he do when time I watched him and accept that accept an Emmy for his

1187
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:20.620
show and he said something to the effect of,
Hi,

1188
01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:23.470
I'm Jerry Seinfeld and I am a bad actor,

1189
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:28.170
but I've proven if you surround yourself with enough talent,
youtube and,

1190
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.410
but did it,
whatever.

1191
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.220
So I went out and tried to find the funniest fucking people I could.

1192
01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.890
So hopefully if I suck,

1193
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.720
the people around me are okay.
So that was my Monday,
Tuesday,

1194
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.980
Wednesday we wrapped at about 9:00 PM Thursday,

1195
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.220
smoked a fucking stokey as men do.

1196
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:54.180
And then I got my little Prius reeking of Dutch masters and uh,

1197
01:05:54.311 --> 01:05:59.311
went home and the next day I boarded a fucking Air Canada flight to Calgary

1198
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.810
and proceeded Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday I went to a Calgary flame game,

1199
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.950
then an Edmonton Oilers game and then a Vancouver Canucks game.

1200
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.040
I always wanted to go up there and uh,
I got to tell you,

1201
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:14.710
it was pretty fucking amazing and I'm pretty God damn cold.

1202
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.430
Do you remember that shit when you were a kid?
Wherever the hell you lived.

1203
01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:22.210
Like I might not,
my nose has not stuck together when inhaling,

1204
01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:25.870
since I went collecting on my paper route and like the fifth grade,

1205
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.150
um,
Calgary,
I don't know what the fuck is in Calgary.
Okay,

1206
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:34.760
let me do my little review of the western part of Canada.
All right.

1207
01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:39.640
Calgary first stop.
Um,
I dunno,

1208
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:42.970
I can't tell.
I don't know what the fuck the deal was.
I didn't see a skyline.

1209
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.760
It was snowing.
Like I haven't seen it snow one years.

1210
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.980
And then I got on their little fucking trolley,

1211
01:06:47.981 --> 01:06:51.640
which was really confusing and I went in the wrong way like seven times,

1212
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:56.641
but the Saddledome was the shit and I sat next to some guy from Canada who said

1213
01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:02.400
a after everything,
you know,
like that's strange brew Shit.
Like,
oh,

1214
01:07:02.401 --> 01:07:06.700
they've got to get it out a a means everything up there.

1215
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:10.930
It means you know,
it means like,
you know what I'm saying?
It means,

1216
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.760
what did you say it means?
Huh?
I guess that also means what he's,

1217
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:16.680
I don't know.
It's like seven.

1218
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:20.890
It's like Donnie Brasco when he fucking explained out,
forget about it.

1219
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:23.440
That's what a is in fucking Alberta.

1220
01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.890
They've got to get it out a and they all sound like they almost sound like

1221
01:07:26.891 --> 01:07:30.550
they're fucking Irish.
I don't,
I'm talking about,
but the game was great.

1222
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:32.890
There was a shootout at the end of the game,

1223
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.250
a and a panthers won that one and then I,

1224
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.400
the next fucking day I drove up to Edmonton through towns like the towns out

1225
01:07:41.861 --> 01:07:46.270
there.
When I was looking at the weather map,
it was like a,
you know,

1226
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:49.060
fucking red deer,
yellow knife,

1227
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:55.030
you know all those Indian names.
The classic White Guy Thing,
you know,

1228
01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.040
you murder a bunch of people,

1229
01:07:57.041 --> 01:08:00.970
you commit genocide and then you name towns after him,
you know,

1230
01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:04.600
did we destroy the won the fucking punk pug people,

1231
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:08.020
let's name a street after him,
maybe even a golf course.

1232
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.060
I think that that's only the right thing to do.

1233
01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.580
Considering none of them exist anymore.

1234
01:08:12.581 --> 01:08:16.910
Let's do something here to remember these people after we've massacred them,

1235
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.750
can put small pockets on their fucking,
their sleeping bags.

1236
01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:24.110
Did Indians have sleeping bags?
I don't think they did.

1237
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:28.790
What did they use for sleeping bags that they sleep in the fucking end trails of

1238
01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:30.440
an animal like Luke Skywalker.

1239
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.300
This podcast went off the rails about fucking two minutes ago because I got in

1240
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:36.111
my head going did,

1241
01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:39.590
I just calmed myself down like five minutes ago and then all of a sudden I

1242
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:42.530
stopped being funny.
I mean it's,
podcasts started off great.

1243
01:08:42.531 --> 01:08:46.820
I Sang Christmas carols,
you know what I mean?
I defended saying Merry Christmas,

1244
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.750
you know,
and then all of a sudden I was like,
wait a minute,
I'm coming off angry.

1245
01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.460
Let's take it down a little bit.

1246
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:56.990
And then all of a sudden I felt like I was doing the traffic.
You know,

1247
01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.120
I like the traffic down in the south when you listen to it because they,
they,

1248
01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:05.510
they still say a,
when there's an accident they call it a wreck.

1249
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.820
And that always makes me feel like I'm watching Nascar.

1250
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.710
We've got a lick down there.
They don't talk like that.

1251
01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:15.650
But that's all I hear at that point when someone says live,
you got to Rick,

1252
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:19.640
there was a car all tore up on the side of the fucking road.

1253
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.700
Um,
and anyways,
then when I drove up,

1254
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:26.330
yeah I was going to stop off in red deer to get something to eat,

1255
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:30.590
to eat just on my way up to Edmonton,
just to say I fucking did it.

1256
01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.300
And then I was like,
you know what,

1257
01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.850
red deer sounds like it reminds me of one of those,

1258
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.130
those a and e murder mystery that I watched where these two hunters had gone up

1259
01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:44.120
to some fucking place to go hunting.
They stopped off in a bar,

1260
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:45.980
they exchanged words with people,

1261
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:50.270
they got killed and then somebody in the bar fed their bodies to pigs.

1262
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:55.460
And it was one of the most creepiest fucking stories I've ever seen.
You know,

1263
01:09:55.490 --> 01:10:00.290
just that whole fucking feed and a person to pigs and they all look like they

1264
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.800
were in like Creedence Clearwater revival.
So it was really fucking with my head.

1265
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:08.420
And,
um,
I don't know,
red deer just sounded like that kind of shit can happen.

1266
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:12.260
So I bypassed it and I continued on up to Edmonton.

1267
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.490
I'm going to tell this story in real time.
Let's fly forward.
Okay.

1268
01:10:16.491 --> 01:10:17.324
I had a great time.

1269
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.570
Edmonson was an awesome game coming up there and seeing all the championship

1270
01:10:20.571 --> 01:10:25.571
banners in the fucking retired jerseys had Gretzky and Aa and all you gotta do

1271
01:10:26.031 --> 01:10:26.990
it.
Okay.

1272
01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:32.260
Not to mention both the Saddledome and Northlands coliseum are just basically,

1273
01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:37.610
uh,
I dunno if they're like no frills.

1274
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:41.720
They made an ice rink and they put seats around it and that's it.

1275
01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:45.290
There's no law.
No,
that's shit.
You know what I mean?
Although,

1276
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:48.890
you know what category definitely had the horse skating around on the ice in

1277
01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:52.940
between and um,
Oh god,

1278
01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:55.550
why don't I get to questions?
I just bored the shit out of myself,

1279
01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:58.040
but there was such a fucking good time.
I had an awesome time up there.

1280
01:10:58.041 --> 01:10:59.620
You know what it is?
I just,

1281
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.110
I woke up at fucking eight in the morning and I just got on a plane and I had to

1282
01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:06.920
come back.
And do the podcast,
so I'm skipping over a bunch of good details.

1283
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:08.830
You know what did I see up there?

1284
01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:13.350
I saw some guy in like minus 90 million degrees Celsius,
whatever the fuck is.

1285
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.440
I think that's like five degrees American and he was fixing a four wheeler with

1286
01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:22.310
no hat on
and no gloves.

1287
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:25.050
You standing out that dream about Arthur funds are rarely used to dress.

1288
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:28.860
When they gave him a garage,
when they ran out of shit to do with this character,

1289
01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:33.060
it was before he became a teacher.
But after him just hanging out at Arnold's,

1290
01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.630
when they will finally like,
okay,
this guy's like 30 he needs a job.

1291
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:39.810
You know what I mean?
How does he afford to live in that attic?

1292
01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:45.270
He was dressed like that and it was fucking cold out and he was fixing a four

1293
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:46.440
wheeler and I was,
it was.

1294
01:11:46.441 --> 01:11:50.010
I actually videotaped it and if I knew how to upload it,
I put it on there.

1295
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:53.130
But anyways,
this is my podcast when it gets to the questions here,

1296
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.410
people send me questions all this week.

1297
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.010
I think I shot my load with that fucking song right up the front.
You know?

1298
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.630
And if I stuck the rest of the way up,

1299
01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.550
you gotta admit three minutes of Christmas,
Carolyn.

1300
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:07.140
Isn't that my defending my podcast?
I mean,
this is ridiculous.

1301
01:12:07.141 --> 01:12:11.100
Like I'm bombing is a comedian.
Go.
Come on man.
No,
and that was a funny joke.

1302
01:12:11.101 --> 01:12:15.450
So it was funny.
You know,
I mean a,
Hey,
this guy,
you know,

1303
01:12:15.451 --> 01:12:19.160
and a nice set up.
I didn't have any extra words.
I disguise the punchline.

1304
01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:20.490
It took a left at the last second.

1305
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.000
Can't help it if you guys don't want to go along for the ride.
All right,

1306
01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:26.600
question number one.
Um,
Bill,
since you're,

1307
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:30.030
you're a struggling actor trying to make it,

1308
01:12:30.031 --> 01:12:34.800
have you ever thought about doing gay porn?
You know,

1309
01:12:34.801 --> 01:12:36.990
you guys are really been assholes lightly,
but you know what?

1310
01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:39.840
I'm going to build a fucking be a man about a hearing.
Kay.
Let's go.

1311
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:42.120
Since you're a struggling actor trying to make it,

1312
01:12:42.121 --> 01:12:44.670
have you ever thought about doing gay porn to make ends meet?

1313
01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:48.720
You already have the iconic shaved head and like hockey.

1314
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.110
Do you have a shaved head and you like hockey,
you're gay.
Okay.

1315
01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.260
Speaking of hockey,
Sean Avery is underrated.

1316
01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.680
Anyone who calls a woman a con and then tells her that he wouldn't even,

1317
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:01.950
I can't read your fucking typing.

1318
01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.300
He wouldn't come in her face because she's too old.
Is Cool with me.

1319
01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.060
All right,
let's get back to your first question.
As a struggling,

1320
01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:14.820
we have ever thought about doing gay porn,
obviously.
No.
Um,

1321
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.270
what is the worst thing I have considered doing?

1322
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.570
I considered doing commercials back when commercials weren't funny.

1323
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.680
Remember back in the day like 10,
12 years,
10,
12 years ago,

1324
01:13:25.681 --> 01:13:30.540
they started to get funny,
but it was that awkward middle ground where,
you know,

1325
01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:35.541
you could be in a really funny commercial or you could just be like a budding

1326
01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:38.940
into a sandwich.
And then given that look to the camera,

1327
01:13:38.941 --> 01:13:42.390
light boil boy was that tasty.
You know,

1328
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:46.260
I remember back in the day like,

1329
01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:51.030
I refuse to do a commercial because I listened to that Bill Hicks rant about

1330
01:13:51.031 --> 01:13:53.400
that.
And um,
then after awhile I was like,

1331
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:57.930
why am I making a difficult business even harder?
You know,

1332
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:01.200
granted,
I don't go out for commercial auditions,

1333
01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:03.210
but it's not because I'm against doing commercials.

1334
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:05.820
I just don't do commercial additions because I'm lazy.

1335
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:09.390
Plus they're all the way out in Santa Monica and I'm not driving all the way

1336
01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:12.760
over there to fucking act like I'm eating a of fruit loops.
I'm not doing that.

1337
01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:17.440
You know,
I do have a little pride.
All right,
question number two,
Bill.
Hey,

1338
01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:19.480
I'm a big fan of the podcast.

1339
01:14:19.481 --> 01:14:21.910
I listened to most of them traveling over the Thanksgiving break.

1340
01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:25.870
I did notice that you have a few favorite words and since I lead a sad,

1341
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:26.800
pathetic life,

1342
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:30.430
I thought it would be funny to count them during last week's podcast.

1343
01:14:30.431 --> 01:14:31.540
So here we go.
Okay.

1344
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:36.020
Evidently this is the list of my favorite words and how many times I say them a

1345
01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.480
cunt.
Three times.
Wow.
That's pretty low.
We are in a recession.

1346
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.710
Um,
I don't know.
I said 27 times shit.

1347
01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.350
I said 42 times.
Fuck,

1348
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:51.570
I said 127 times.
Wow.

1349
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.930
2027 times.
Let's do the math there.
That's about three times a minute.

1350
01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:00.400
Four times a minute to do about a half hour podcast.
Wow.

1351
01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.640
I'm the Wayne Gretzky of the f word.
All right.
Choke out a pheasant.

1352
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:06.520
I say one time.
I said one time.
Okay.

1353
01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:10.210
You're Popeye Popeye like up,
up,
up.

1354
01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.570
Chuckle to yourself nine times.
Okay.

1355
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:15.610
I don't know if that was interesting to anybody.

1356
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.880
I was kind of interesting to me that somebody that fucking lonely.

1357
01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.760
Um,
all right.
Underrated.
Overrated.
Overrated.
Brendan Frasier.

1358
01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.230
Oh,
underrated.
Brendan Frazier.
Eric Lindros.
When he first came into the league,

1359
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:31.510
completely bald.

1360
01:15:31.511 --> 01:15:36.190
Vagina and college are overrated.
I would go with you.

1361
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:39.370
They had the ball.
Vagina is just fucking creepy.

1362
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.580
It's really fucking creepy.
Um,
yeah.
Not a fan.

1363
01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:50.160
Not a fan.
No.
I don't want to go down to a thatched hut either seen,

1364
01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:53.480
I don't do this shit.
I'm like,
I'm not taking it in this direction.
God dammit.
Um,

1365
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.090
all right.
Three bill.
If you could have one superpower,
what would it be?

1366
01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:03.160
Also,
how would you use it?
Uh,
would you fight crime,

1367
01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:06.470
which you commit crimes or would you just use it to beat the shit out of people

1368
01:16:06.471 --> 01:16:10.390
who heckled you?
Um,
you know what I would do,

1369
01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:14.920
I would use it to a freak people out who had power.
You know,

1370
01:16:14.921 --> 01:16:17.240
like if I was like,
I mean,
I can't just have one super power.

1371
01:16:17.241 --> 01:16:19.720
I got to have a couple.
Like if I put it this way,
if I was like superman,

1372
01:16:19.721 --> 01:16:22.810
I could fly.
I could,
I could see through,
you know,

1373
01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:26.830
walls and I was bulletproof.
I would,
I would,
yeah,

1374
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:31.480
I would fuck with people who had power.
I'd fly into the Oval Office,

1375
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:35.130
you know,
right in the middle of them talking about shit,
you know,

1376
01:16:35.131 --> 01:16:39.160
or just be standing outside the window,
you know,
just staring.

1377
01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.980
And I'm like Michael Myers and like Halloween,
I would just do that.

1378
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:46.630
I would just freak the fuck out.
Um,
I wouldn't use it to fight crime.

1379
01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.820
I would use it to get to my gigs a little quicker rather than flying southwest.

1380
01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.180
And I would just wear my superhero outfit the whole week,
you know,

1381
01:16:55.181 --> 01:16:57.430
like Steve Martin,
you know,
he always wore that white suit.

1382
01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.760
I would just wear whatever my superhero fucking suit was and I just slide in my

1383
01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:06.550
gigs.
And then I fly home,
no security,

1384
01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.970
no fucking bags.
I'd have little toothbrush in my utility belt.

1385
01:17:12.130 --> 01:17:14.060
What would I do with my,
I don't know what I would do with it.

1386
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:19.360
I would fuck with corporations and,
and leaders of the world.
Um,

1387
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:24.550
and all my information would be shit that I read on Youtube and Wikipedia and a,

1388
01:17:24.861 --> 01:17:29.390
yeah,
that's what I would do.
Um,
wow.
No fucking energy this week.

1389
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:30.430
What is wrong with me?
Oh,

1390
01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.490
so excited about this podcast and I just really feel like this is a bill burr

1391
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.540
woefully miscast and the Monday morning podcast.
I'm number six.
Bill.

1392
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:43.160
I was wondering if there are any situations that you steer away from when you

1393
01:17:43.161 --> 01:17:44.120
work?
Audiences.

1394
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.080
I'm not talking about something as profound as a racial observation,

1395
01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:53.030
but any social subjects that crowd's really don't respond to or is everything up

1396
01:17:53.031 --> 01:17:57.740
for grabs as,
okay.
These,
these are two things.
I don't really do sex,
sex material.

1397
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:02.960
I just feel like the crowd absolutely loses their mind.
If you talk about sex,

1398
01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:05.060
no matter what you're saying.
And I got to Mit,

1399
01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:08.580
I was still a little crude when I'm talking about it.
You know,

1400
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:11.060
even that's why he kind of broke off the whole bald,
the Jina thing.

1401
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:15.200
It's just gets,
it's no class,
you know?
I don't know.
It's just crude.

1402
01:18:15.201 --> 01:18:19.700
Unless you have a really unique fucking story to tell.
You know,

1403
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:20.960
I'm not like a prude or anything,

1404
01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:24.020
but a lot of times like when I go to see movies and you know,

1405
01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:27.470
two actors or having a love scene and there's some guys sucking on the girls

1406
01:18:27.471 --> 01:18:31.540
titties,
it's,
it's ridiculous to me.
I always look at the person like that,

1407
01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:35.660
that's not even necessary to moving the story along.

1408
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.890
You know,

1409
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:40.040
back in the day they would just show the cup of gold in the room and they would

1410
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:45.041
close the door and then they would just play that saxophone because the always

1411
01:18:45.531 --> 01:18:49.670
back in the day always meant someone was going to some book.
People were fucking,

1412
01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.260
that's what the saxophone meant.

1413
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:55.010
Either meant that or someone was going to do a strip tease and he had to play

1414
01:18:55.011 --> 01:18:58.730
with that really fucking blue.
Wow.
Fucking sound.

1415
01:18:58.731 --> 01:19:01.880
And everybody knew that somebody was getting some Dick.
Right.

1416
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:05.210
But you didn't have to show it.
You know?

1417
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:07.370
That was my whole thing with like Brokeback mountain.

1418
01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.010
I don't love mine watching a movie about a couple of gay cowboys,

1419
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.520
but I don't know how much,
a couple of dudes fucking a tent,
you know?

1420
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:16.760
I don't understand that.
And then like what?

1421
01:19:16.761 --> 01:19:21.050
That makes me more comfortable with my sexuality because I look at that,

1422
01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:24.980
I got to admit half the time there's two things that really grossed me out and

1423
01:19:24.981 --> 01:19:27.860
movies.
It's like over the top,

1424
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:31.970
kissing his fucking gross to me and act.

1425
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:36.140
People who eat during scenes.
I don't know if he's,
I have probably talked about,

1426
01:19:36.141 --> 01:19:38.120
this is my number one pet peeve in a movie.

1427
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.190
Like I've gone out for lunch with people and they're eating and they talk and

1428
01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:47.060
they take their moments when to do it.
Something about actors,

1429
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:49.520
the second they're in a movie and they start eating,

1430
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.770
they start overacting eating,
you know,
and they start fucking point.

1431
01:19:53.771 --> 01:19:56.910
And with bread,
yeah,
you got fucking dude.

1432
01:19:56.911 --> 01:19:59.660
When they got shit hanging out of their mouth,
it's like,
dude,

1433
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.340
why don't you finish what you're eating,
collect your fucking thoughts,
swallow,

1434
01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:09.390
and then present your line.
Okay.
I don't need you.
You fucking,
sorry.

1435
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.090
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm talking about now?
There's two subjects.
Okay.

1436
01:20:12.091 --> 01:20:14.660
So sex and,
um,

1437
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.800
I don't make fun of the mentally handicapped.
I just don't,

1438
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.720
it just crosses the line.

1439
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:25.170
I've done it before in the opiate Anthony Show I've piled on.

1440
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.520
I've definitely said some shit on stage if it just pops into my head.

1441
01:20:29.521 --> 01:20:34.410
But generally speaking,
I don't write bits.
I just don't,
you know,
half of it.

1442
01:20:34.411 --> 01:20:37.830
Cause I think,
you know,
that's just brutal to me.
And then secondly,

1443
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:41.160
I haven't had any kids yet and I really feel like I'm jinxing myself.

1444
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:46.290
A long time ago I did do comic view and I did do a bit about movies,

1445
01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:48.960
about the mentally handicapped.

1446
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:53.760
I don't know if he can find that on Youtube and,
uh,

1447
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:57.270
my parents saw it and they weren't happy and I'm still looking for approval.

1448
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:01.970
So I took that.
Uh,
I don't know.

1449
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:04.710
There's too many details.
I,
yeah,
those are the two subjects.
I really don't,

1450
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.300
I don't do shit like that.

1451
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.490
And I also try not to do a stuff that will reinforce more chronic thought,

1452
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.740
you know,
as far as like,
uh,
racial shit.
I try not to do that.

1453
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.410
But everything else,
yeah,
I don't care.
Other than that,

1454
01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.890
I really enjoy pissing people off and the crowd,
you know,

1455
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.620
um,
like whatever,
whatever group I was denied bag,
if that merry Christmas group,

1456
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:32.820
you know,
the people who find that offensive where at my show,
like,
you know,

1457
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:38.420
it would just basically be your duty as a comedian to just make their night as

1458
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:43.260
miserable as fucking possible.
So I'm definitely an asshole.
But yeah,

1459
01:21:43.261 --> 01:21:47.790
those were the sex,
sex and the retarded right there.
There you go.
Those are,

1460
01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:52.620
those are the lines all right now.
But hey bill,
do you fish?
Uh,
no I don't.

1461
01:21:52.621 --> 01:21:57.530
Occasionally I have,
I've gone fishing,
but now I don't own a rod or a real,
um,

1462
01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:01.900
my favorite part of it is going on on the boat and hoping to see what I like

1463
01:22:01.901 --> 01:22:06.360
looking at wildlife.
I don't like killing it.
You know,

1464
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:10.560
even if that fish are just fucking bothers me,
like,
you know,

1465
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:13.200
there's already dead fish in the supermarket one and just eat that.

1466
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:16.680
But then I read all the survival stuff like I should know how to do this.

1467
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:20.970
But then you go out deep sea fishing and they fucking do everything for you.

1468
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:26.430
You just sit down there like annual rod and reel,
sir.
They just hand it to you.

1469
01:22:26.431 --> 01:22:30.870
They tell you what to do.
They know where to go,
where the fish are.
And it's like,

1470
01:22:30.871 --> 01:22:32.100
you know,
you feel like,
I feel like,

1471
01:22:32.101 --> 01:22:36.090
you know when you're like five years old and your dad lets you sit in his lap

1472
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:39.690
and steer the fucking car and you're like,
damn girl in the car.
No you're not.
No,

1473
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:44.100
you're not.
You're a fucking child.
Um,
and I also really enjoy the drinking.

1474
01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:46.620
Uh,
that's the part of the fishing that I liked.

1475
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:51.330
Even though booze and boats don't miss mix according to the posters.
All right,

1476
01:22:51.331 --> 01:22:51.900
Bill,

1477
01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:55.410
who do you think are the top three electrical guard took guitarists that are

1478
01:22:55.411 --> 01:23:00.270
currently performing?
I have no fucking idea.
I'm 40 years old.
I should know that.

1479
01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:01.560
All right.

1480
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.010
My favorites of all time or Stevie Ray Vaughan and recently really got back into

1481
01:23:06.011 --> 01:23:10.000
Jimmy page.
I really got back into his shit and um,

1482
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:13.270
I don't know who the third one is.
Take your pick,
but it's definitely,

1483
01:23:13.271 --> 01:23:16.150
I don't like the Steve Vai,
Joe Satriani kind of guys,

1484
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:18.580
those guys who can play really fast,

1485
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:22.470
but it sounds like they're playing on a Casio keyboard.
Um,

1486
01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:27.160
I'm not into really fast guys.
Um,
I'm into those guys.
You know those,

1487
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:31.060
you know those guys,
guys that give you chills.
Speaking of which,

1488
01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:32.530
the best part of that is what I want it to,

1489
01:23:32.531 --> 01:23:36.580
the best part of the fucking hockey trip that I took was when I went to

1490
01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:41.581
Vancouver and they sang Oh Canada and the guy comes out and he sings the first

1491
01:23:41.651 --> 01:23:46.651
verse or whatever and then he stops and then he just sorta conducts the crowd as

1492
01:23:46.871 --> 01:23:48.100
they sang the second half.

1493
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:51.910
I got literally goosebumps listening to the people up in Vancouver singing o

1494
01:23:51.911 --> 01:23:54.730
Canada cause I never heard it sung like that.
You know,

1495
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:58.930
people in America at the hockey game sing o Canada,

1496
01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:04.230
the way they sing the fucking national American national anthem in Canada.

1497
01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:08.350
There's no passion.
You don't give a fuck.
You know,

1498
01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:10.660
you should have heard him singing.
And they were like,
ah,

1499
01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:15.360
say can you say blah,
blah blah.

1500
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:19.310
And then they get to this song and they just like,
Oh God,

1501
01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:22.420
oh they fucking,
you know,
milking every note there,

1502
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:27.000
intuit Gloria sent free.
All right,

1503
01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:32.020
enough thing here.
All right,
bill number nine at Caroline's to Caroline show,

1504
01:24:32.021 --> 01:24:35.560
you mentioned that your grandmother is 101 years old at her age.

1505
01:24:35.561 --> 01:24:39.400
Does she still have any messed up out of date reasonings?

1506
01:24:39.401 --> 01:24:44.401
My grandfather is 86 he's typical old Italian man Sharpe for his age,

1507
01:24:44.891 --> 01:24:49.360
but recently in an interracial couple moved next door to him and we had to stop

1508
01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:52.630
him from going to city hall because he wanted to have his property taxes lower

1509
01:24:52.631 --> 01:24:56.830
due to the fact as he put it,
a colored woman is living next door.

1510
01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.980
I swear to God.
That's true.
No bullshit.
What do you think?

1511
01:24:59.981 --> 01:25:04.180
Fucked up fucking classic or a little both.
Um,

1512
01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.810
that's a hard one.
Obviously if somebody you know,

1513
01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:11.110
below the age of 60 thinks something like that.
Yeah,
that's fucked up.

1514
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:16.080
But um,
I mean the guy's fucking let's,
let's do the math every,

1515
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:20.560
he's 86 years old.
All right,
let's,
why don't we do this here?

1516
01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:23.810
He's six plus four is 94 years from now.

1517
01:25:23.811 --> 01:25:27.790
It was 2012 so he was born in 1922.

1518
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:33.910
All right.
The Guy Born in 19 fucking 22.
Uh,

1519
01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.060
alright.
He's 18 and 1940.

1520
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.380
They didn't even let black people in the fucking army.
And when they did,

1521
01:25:41.381 --> 01:25:43.810
they put them in a special unit.

1522
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:49.120
It's like fucking 15 years before

1523
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.500
when the fuck was civil rights.
Now it was like 25 fucking years after that.
23.

1524
01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.700
Yeah,
no,
I mean that's kind of,
yeah,
that's his wheelhouse.
You know what I mean?

1525
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:05.570
The same way.
I don't know like what best guitarists are that are playing today.

1526
01:26:05.571 --> 01:26:09.470
Cause now I'm 40.
I'm off like you just,
you're,
you're,
you're awake.

1527
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:14.000
You shoved off to see,
I got my fucking 10 albums in my head.

1528
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:16.190
Then I'm going to listen to for the rest of my life,

1529
01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:21.170
the same way old people still listen to in the mood that it had dead,
dead,
dead.

1530
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.020
They fucking love that song.
I hate that song drives me nuts.

1531
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:26.510
It makes me want to kill somebody.
But when I'm 80,

1532
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:31.511
I'll still be listening to back in black and I think you take how you think

1533
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:35.120
along with you.
So,
um,
I dunno.

1534
01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:39.500
And at that point he's 86.
Is He really going to start a hate group?

1535
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:42.770
You know,
it's kind of funny.

1536
01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:45.860
Racism becomes funny.

1537
01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:50.240
Only when you're so fucking old you couldn't do anything about it,
you know?

1538
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:53.870
Then he'd just become this crazy old guy who's just saying a bunch of shit.

1539
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.230
So I guess,
yeah,
it is.
That is funny.
That is funny.
But you know,

1540
01:26:57.231 --> 01:26:58.780
it's weird isn't getting back to them.

1541
01:26:58.781 --> 01:27:01.250
What that kid was asking me about what you talk about right now.

1542
01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:05.660
I feel like I have a social responsibility because I'm talking to 14 people over

1543
01:27:05.661 --> 01:27:08.960
the goddamn phone to now say that that's fucked up.
Okay.
You know what,

1544
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.250
in public on television of the guide did that that's definitely fucked up.

1545
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:16.580
But sitting in your living room and your grandparents said something fucking

1546
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:19.160
racist.
It's hilarious.
You know,

1547
01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:22.970
not cause you can donate just because they're so uncensored and they don't give

1548
01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:26.750
a fuck and a,
yeah,
I probably would have laughed.
I would have left.

1549
01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.090
I'm not saying I'm condoning it on any level.
All right.
Question of a 10.
Uh,
no.

1550
01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:35.310
What's really,
really overrated,
overrated or underrated.
Um,

1551
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:40.400
this assumption that all gay men are funny.
You know what,

1552
01:27:40.401 --> 01:27:43.580
that's just hilarious right there.
Cause you really do picture,
I'm like that.

1553
01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.590
I've actually said that defense of gay people,

1554
01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:48.860
like I don't understand why people have such a problem with them.
You know,

1555
01:27:48.861 --> 01:27:51.440
they're fucking hilarious and exactly.
You know,

1556
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:54.290
I don't want to watch two from fucking a 10th,
you know,
I have my,

1557
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.950
but this guy says basically I work in a restaurant and we never share a gay guys

1558
01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:00.020
that have a great sense of humor.

1559
01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:04.250
But just because you're gay doesn't mean describing what you'd let Clive Owen

1560
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:08.630
duty to you in great detail is funny.
Yeah,
that's kind of nasty.

1561
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.660
I've known a couple of gay guys would get a little over the top with the fucking

1562
01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:16.320
description of this sexual shit that they want to do,
you know?
Yeah.

1563
01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:20.030
It does get creepy,
you know,
but you know what it is?

1564
01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:25.031
That's Karma for straight guys because how that makes you feel as a straight

1565
01:28:25.191 --> 01:28:27.980
guy.
That's how women feel when you,
when you know,

1566
01:28:27.981 --> 01:28:29.460
some girl walks by and you're like,
yeah,

1567
01:28:29.461 --> 01:28:33.080
I'd love to fucking been here to or you know,
whatever.
Fucking Evil Shit you say.

1568
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:37.790
So.
Um,
yeah.
Wow.

1569
01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.310
That's a lot of awful images in my head.
All right,
let's get to the next one.

1570
01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.260
Overrated cable TV,

1571
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:47.030
especially the movie channels because they just rerun all the same suck ass

1572
01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:50.480
movies like kindergarten,
kindergarten,
cop are under siege.

1573
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:55.580
They still run van Damme movies and the worst are the cheesy pornos.

1574
01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.970
Um,
yeah.
You know what?
I've got to admit,

1575
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.670
the only reason why I watch a fucking movie TV is just to watch the fights.

1576
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:08.040
And I watched that show.
Dexter,
is anybody even still listening to this podcast?

1577
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:12.090
I'm so fucking jet lag right now from flying to scene three hockey games,

1578
01:29:12.091 --> 01:29:14.450
the three nights I think.
I feel like I'm just a,

1579
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:18.600
I'm reading like the fucking stock report.
All right.
Underrated.
Oh,

1580
01:29:18.601 --> 01:29:23.340
this dude wake you up.
The sex swing.
The sex swing is underrated.

1581
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:27.660
Really?
I didn't know people were out there going fucking blows.

1582
01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:31.170
Or maybe you're saying it's underrated because no one really talks about it and,

1583
01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:33.900
okay,
let's hear the review.
The sex swing.
Really,

1584
01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:38.340
I'm not trying to be scandalous or anything.
Um,

1585
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.420
if this is something people have not yet tried,
for Christ's sake,
try it.

1586
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:46.680
I promise.
It makes it fun and easy to fuck.
Yes.

1587
01:29:46.681 --> 01:29:48.990
Because the rest of us find it tedious

1588
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:54.450
and not fun.
You know what?
That's the way you should,
you know what?

1589
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.100
I think that that's the sex swing should be for old people who get Viagra and

1590
01:29:59.101 --> 01:30:01.920
they still want to fuck.
All right.
Oh Wow.

1591
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:06.270
I just said I wasn't gonna do sex material,
but you really just fucking,
you know,

1592
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:09.450
he's fucking lobbed it over.
Okay.
This is what you do.
Okay.

1593
01:30:09.451 --> 01:30:13.050
You fucking lube up grandma.
All right.
Not Grandma your wife now.

1594
01:30:13.051 --> 01:30:17.550
It's really disgusting.
All right.
You fucking take a little Fiat Agra

1595
01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:23.730
and then you just push her away.
Like it just wouldn't you like a little kid.

1596
01:30:23.731 --> 01:30:26.010
You just push away,
just keeps coming to you.
Ah,

1597
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:28.360
and then you just push her away again.
Oh,

1598
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:35.070
I you fucking bag away.
And when else,
what if he impregnated,

1599
01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:40.770
you know,
Sherry,
you'd be dead by the time the kids fucking in kindergarten,

1600
01:30:40.771 --> 01:30:43.020
but you now you're fucking be on good day America.

1601
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:45.660
They think of that act like it was cute.

1602
01:30:45.661 --> 01:30:50.661
Like when Tony Randall had a kid at 72 oh that Tony and Tony fucking Randall,

1603
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:55.440
you don't even if you have a kid at 72 you know,
especially if it's a boy,

1604
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:59.760
what you basically just had is a future felon.
All right?

1605
01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:04.761
Because the fucking confusion of having a 72 year old gay man as your dad who

1606
01:31:04.921 --> 01:31:08.370
dies when you're in the fourth grade,
you know,
at the very least,

1607
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:12.390
you know you're going to rob a convenience store.
I don't know.

1608
01:31:14.190 --> 01:31:15.860
I was just,
that was really,
I thought it was a,

1609
01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.500
it was an asshole move on his part and I've never been able to enjoy the odd

1610
01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:24.450
couple the way I used to.
Um,
all right.
All right.

1611
01:31:24.451 --> 01:31:27.000
Overrated.
I like this one.
This is a great one song.

1612
01:31:27.210 --> 01:31:29.970
This is overrated songs for causes.

1613
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:34.920
You know those hacky collaboration's with a bunch of stars in the same studio.

1614
01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:40.320
Um,
you're a singer lead the life and death shit to someone else.
All right.

1615
01:31:40.321 --> 01:31:44.460
That's sort of a two part thing there.
I hate songs for causes.
Um,

1616
01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:48.870
I didn't mind that we are the world kind of Shit just because that actually

1617
01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:50.160
seemed like a,

1618
01:31:50.490 --> 01:31:54.720
there was so many people involved that no one really got the credit.

1619
01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:58.410
But like,
um,
you know,
when all those rednecks we're making those,

1620
01:31:58.411 --> 01:32:02.050
let's go to war song songs and protect the boys.

1621
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:05.920
Those songs were really,
really fucking cheesy.
Oh,

1622
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:09.970
is that Warren and Uncle Sam's going to put a boot in your ass or whatever the

1623
01:32:09.971 --> 01:32:10.810
fuck that one of them is.

1624
01:32:10.811 --> 01:32:15.400
Just really one of the most ignorant songs I think I've ever heard.

1625
01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.520
And,
uh,
and plus,
you know,
like,

1626
01:32:18.521 --> 01:32:22.390
who the fuck is not going to like a song that says,
you know,

1627
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:27.200
support the troops and let's go fuck up some people.
Um,

1628
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.330
I guess they've always done that,
right?
The boogie Boogie Woogie bugle boy.

1629
01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:36.060
Remember that about the need the data,
data,
data that bad.
All right.
Um,

1630
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.920
and you said you're a singer lead the life and death shit to someone else.

1631
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.040
I disagree with that.
I don't think just because you're in the public eye,

1632
01:32:42.041 --> 01:32:45.190
therefore you shouldn't talk about who you vote for or you shouldn't have

1633
01:32:45.191 --> 01:32:49.670
opinions.
All right?
Be honest with yourself.
All right,
the f this,

1634
01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:52.480
every bar you walk into,
there's people talking politics.

1635
01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.750
They're talking life and death shit.
People sitting there going,
dude,
you know,

1636
01:32:55.751 --> 01:32:57.220
we should know.
You know,

1637
01:32:57.221 --> 01:33:00.460
we should do right some fucking more on down the end of the bar.

1638
01:33:00.461 --> 01:33:03.460
You listen to him,
you'll actually fucking wait until he's finished.

1639
01:33:03.461 --> 01:33:04.720
You'll never call him a moron,

1640
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:07.890
but then all of a sudden you have a fucking hit song and you,
you,

1641
01:33:07.891 --> 01:33:10.420
you don't want to hear somebody talking about it.
You know what it is.

1642
01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:14.140
This is what it is.
I should've just said,
this is what it is.
Rather than go,

1643
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:18.700
you know what it is.
All right.
I'm like,
you could actually respond to me.

1644
01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:19.871
It's the fact,

1645
01:33:19.871 --> 01:33:24.360
it's very hard to do stuff like that without coming off as preachy.
And,
um,

1646
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:28.210
that's another thing in my act that I try to never do.

1647
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:32.950
I never use the word we because I saw a comedian do at one time and it annoyed

1648
01:33:32.951 --> 01:33:34.060
the shit on me.
He was like,

1649
01:33:34.061 --> 01:33:38.730
do we do this now we want a country where we bah blah,
blah.
I,

1650
01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:42.730
it was like,
dude,
I want to fucking choke you.
Um,

1651
01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:47.420
with the Mike Court.
Oh God.
Just the references are just on flying out.
You know,

1652
01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.650
this really is a train wreck.
This is like a,
what was that?

1653
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.000
What was that fucking album that,

1654
01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:54.700
that dude that not from the beach boys never put up.

1655
01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:01.020
What was it called?
A fucking not pet sounds it fun.

1656
01:34:01.021 --> 01:34:03.010
They finally just put it out when he was just going nuts.

1657
01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:06.550
This is my podcast version of this.
Um,
saw,
oh,

1658
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:08.680
that let George Michael one where he was just like,

1659
01:34:08.681 --> 01:34:10.530
I'm not going to be in the videos darling.

1660
01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:13.840
I'm just going to put other people in them.
I want the music to stand on itself.

1661
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:17.350
And then his career just takes a fucking nosedive.
It's like,
listen,

1662
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:22.120
listen,
okay.
Even gay or Tom Cruise,
if you're not,

1663
01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:24.760
if you're not fucking wear it,

1664
01:34:24.761 --> 01:34:29.761
shaking your ass in the TV with your little fucking stupid little scruff going.

1665
01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:34.570
Nobody gives a fuck.
You know?
I know I didn't give a fuck as much.

1666
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.330
I was like,
if I couldn't see George Michael's ass,

1667
01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:40.690
he would.

1668
01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:43.930
That was a very confusing artists for me cause I really liked how he sang on

1669
01:34:43.931 --> 01:34:48.760
some songs.
I'm like,
when he redid that Elton John Song,
he fucking destroyed it.

1670
01:34:48.761 --> 01:34:52.720
But he was just so fucking a feminine.
It just made me uncomfortable.

1671
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:57.440
You know,
if he just said,
listen,
I'm gay,

1672
01:34:57.470 --> 01:35:00.470
and I just got done blowing somebody and I'd really love to do it again,

1673
01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.650
that would destroy the tension.
And he's like,
okay,
he's out in the open.

1674
01:35:03.650 --> 01:35:05.780
Then he can laugh about it.
You know,
he did.

1675
01:35:05.781 --> 01:35:09.290
I just blow somebody and I was singing a song.
I'm what a guy,

1676
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:14.120
but it's a fact that,
that he doesn't bring it up and I was singing.

1677
01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:17.930
Then occasionally,
you know,
he does a little fucking twinkle toes move.

1678
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:21.920
It just makes it fucking uncomfortable and very hard to enjoy the music.

1679
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:26.270
All right.
Another thing that is underrated,
a good waiter and or bartender,

1680
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:30.290
um,
just some guys really good at his job,

1681
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.770
especially when you don't have to ask them for anything and he's right on top of

1682
01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:34.940
it.
Absolutely.

1683
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:40.040
Like the fucking waiters in the bartenders over at Smith and Wollensky you ever

1684
01:35:40.041 --> 01:35:43.460
want to go there and have a fucking professional waiter?
Slash.
Bartender?

1685
01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:46.700
I told you guys I was over there.
Lazarus is fucking great.

1686
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:49.550
You felt like it got to him.
It felt like you're really in the rat pack.

1687
01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.250
Everybody was dressed nice.
I'm get married.
Let people know you're not a homo.

1688
01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.280
Um,
thanksgiving,
uh,
is overrated.

1689
01:35:58.281 --> 01:36:01.850
A day involved with nothing but gorging yourself and watching high school in pro

1690
01:36:01.851 --> 01:36:05.930
football,
junk food.
Brusk breakfast cereals,
overrated.

1691
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.221
I Dunno about you,

1692
01:36:07.221 --> 01:36:12.140
but a bowl of fruity pebbles or co cookie crisp is just as good when you first

1693
01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:16.430
wake up as when your shit faced.
You know what,
I got to agree with you,

1694
01:36:16.431 --> 01:36:18.440
but I would definitely go with fruity pebbles,

1695
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:24.500
cookie crisp and captain crunch.
You know,
as much as I liked him as a kid,

1696
01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:28.700
Jeff,
we get a mouthful of those things and that when you bite down,

1697
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:30.710
there's like three of them.
One of them,

1698
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:34.760
just one of them turned sideways on your tongue and it misses your teeth and it

1699
01:36:34.761 --> 01:36:39.440
hits the roof of your mouth.
I mean,
dude,
that is a fucking pain.
Like,

1700
01:36:39.441 --> 01:36:42.200
I mean in Guantanamo they should do that.

1701
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:46.700
They should fucking put truck and Coco Crisp on fucking people's tongues and

1702
01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:48.950
make them bite down.
You get all the information you want.

1703
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.210
I don't like those series.

1704
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:53.870
I don't like cereals that you know or they get on the outside of your teeth and

1705
01:36:53.871 --> 01:36:58.220
they go right up in between.
You know that that skin that covers your teeth,

1706
01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:02.410
whatever.
That's the,
I guess that's called your face.
Yeah.
Gets,

1707
01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.600
gets underneath that.
You know.
And just fucking drives it in there.

1708
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.000
And then that night you forget that you did it,

1709
01:37:08.230 --> 01:37:12.590
then you're brushing your teeth and of course the toothbrush goes off your teeth

1710
01:37:12.591 --> 01:37:14.660
and goes right into that raw fucking place.

1711
01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:20.060
I don't like those series fruity pebbles.
I like,
what else do I like?

1712
01:37:20.061 --> 01:37:21.500
You know,
fruity pebbles is one of the few ones.

1713
01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:25.940
I don't get that fucking crazy with breakfast series.
I liked,
I like classics.

1714
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:31.460
Cheerio's raisin bran,
grape nuts flakes.
I like grape nuts,

1715
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:34.940
you know?
And I know you think it will keep those things to so granulated.

1716
01:37:34.941 --> 01:37:36.680
They can't cut.
Cut Up your fucking mouth.
I would.

1717
01:37:36.681 --> 01:37:39.410
I really have to end this podcast.
I could apologize you guys.

1718
01:37:39.411 --> 01:37:42.470
Just one of the worst podcasts I've had.
I've just,
you know,

1719
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:47.890
probably nine times during this podcast have literally just kind of come to

1720
01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.730
feeling like I passed out for three minutes and I know I continue talking so I

1721
01:37:52.731 --> 01:37:56.710
apologize for any Florida and sort of,
I can't even talk with me.

1722
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.480
I said any FordF instead of any sort of,
all right,
here we go.
Let's get,
let's,

1723
01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.200
let's wrap this up bill and get on with it.
Okay.
Um,
another thing,

1724
01:38:07.201 --> 01:38:08.034
overrated.

1725
01:38:08.370 --> 01:38:13.080
A dude who has the balls to wear for that is fucking hilarious.

1726
01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:14.010
All right,
here's a story.

1727
01:38:14.011 --> 01:38:18.030
I saw a guy the other day wearing a full length raccoon coat and it looks so

1728
01:38:18.031 --> 01:38:19.230
fucking bad ass.

1729
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:23.730
And the best part was that he also had the fox head scarf to go with it.

1730
01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.420
Maybe you want to get one of my own.
You know what?
That's fucking hilarious.

1731
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:31.420
There's not enough people out there address like fur trappers,
you know,

1732
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:34.010
that's also,
you know,
because that's,

1733
01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:38.040
that's one of those things like merry Christmas now it's just become taboo to

1734
01:38:38.041 --> 01:38:42.810
wear for,
which,
you know,
I wouldn't wear for,
but uh,
you know,
I would never,

1735
01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:45.330
you know,
spray ketchup at somebody who was wearing,

1736
01:38:45.331 --> 01:38:48.720
if I all of a sudden pheasant,
I almost set a pheasant.

1737
01:38:48.721 --> 01:38:53.640
That really is my default animal,
isn't it?
God dammit.
You know what?

1738
01:38:53.641 --> 01:38:56.880
Whoever wrote that in,
you got me.
You got one of my ticks.
We were playing poker.

1739
01:38:56.881 --> 01:39:01.620
You'd know exactly what my hand was.
Um,
all right.
One more overrated,

1740
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:04.650
underrated Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

1741
01:39:05.610 --> 01:39:09.150
And Am is overrated.
His hyper B and the next one in hockey.

1742
01:39:09.151 --> 01:39:12.460
I'm so fucking sick and tired of hearing this out,
be it,

1743
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.220
it's died down in the past year.

1744
01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.060
Hearing that he's the next Gretske I'm sick of hearing that he's next.

1745
01:39:18.090 --> 01:39:22.440
The next Greski he's not,
uh,
yeah.
Well,
I mean that's Kinda like,

1746
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:24.450
that's not his fault dude.

1747
01:39:24.451 --> 01:39:27.990
That's because everyone wants someone to be the next Gretzky.
You know,

1748
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:31.320
he's not writing the articles.
That's like after Michael Jordan retired,

1749
01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:33.210
there was a nice,
you know,

1750
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:35.760
there's always going to be done hangover and saying someone's going to be the

1751
01:39:35.761 --> 01:39:40.470
next fucking uh,
Jordan because you want to see it and a,
it ain't gonna happen.

1752
01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:46.320
Um,
and I think a,
that's it.
Some quick ones.
Underrated.
Overrated,

1753
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:50.190
underrated.
Vinyl.
Overrated.
The compact disc.

1754
01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.950
Um,
I think contact this or underrated,
you know,
all you people going out,

1755
01:39:55.951 --> 01:39:58.140
they just get your music digitally and then what happens?

1756
01:39:58.141 --> 01:40:01.020
You fucking Ipod dies and you lose your entire collection.

1757
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:04.250
I've talked about this.
You want the comp having a compact.

1758
01:40:04.251 --> 01:40:07.950
This is like having the gold behind your paper money.
All right?

1759
01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:11.970
You need to back up your digital shit cause it's not worth anything.

1760
01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.890
Compact discs are tangible.
You have the vinyl,

1761
01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.640
definitely underrated.
It definitely gets hot and sticky and the sun.

1762
01:40:20.641 --> 01:40:24.660
But if you spill something,
it's very easy to clean.
And uh,
that's it.

1763
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:27.450
That's still,
yeah.
Monday morning podcast for this week.

1764
01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:30.000
I really apologize for being so fucking jet lag.

1765
01:40:30.001 --> 01:40:35.001
I hope I can get some sort of points for getting right off the Goddamn plane and

What do I have to hype here?

1769
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:51.390
I'm literally taking off my hooded sweatshirt.
That's how right in the door.

1770
01:40:51.391 --> 01:40:56.320
I was when I fucking doing this podcast.

I really should send you some sort of a gift.
Uh,

1773
01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.630
would you like to hear another holiday song?
And it's like fucking a,

1774
01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.240
I don't know the words,
you know,

1775

you don't mind mother fucking holiday song I hate the most is silver bells.

1776
01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:22.380
It's just the sum of about the tempo of that song just sucks the life out of the

1777
01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:25.040
lower half of my body and I just have to,
you know what?

1778
01:41:25.050 --> 01:41:29.470
It always comes on when I'm in a mall and I really just don't want to shop

1779
01:41:29.471 --> 01:41:33.550
anymore and it just comes on sale.
Vrbo.

1780
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:36.310
So Vrbo,

1781

And I hate that Michael Jackson,
Jackson Santa Claus is coming to town.

1785
01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:01.180
I hate the way he phrases it and I know we'll make it fun.

1786
01:42:01.181 --> 01:42:04.540
Have a fucking seven year old and I should just be happy that he was able to go

1787
01:42:04.541 --> 01:42:07.010
into the studio and perform that day.
But I

1788
01:42:10.810 --> 01:42:14.020
shut the fuck.
Just shut up Michael,

1789

1793
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:40.510
January 8th.
I'm already back out on the road.
Wait,

1795

1796
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.580
Can we see these people out there churning butter?

1797
01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:51.910

Florida.

1798
01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.960
January 8th,
ninth and 10th.

1799
01:42:54.970 --> 01:42:59.080
And I haven't been there in a long fucking time and uh,

1800
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:03.610
that they'd scare the shit out of me because I'm,
Florida is a,

1801
01:43:03.611 --> 01:43:06.310
it's a crazy animal man.
I don't know what to do with it.

1802
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:10.720
I don't know how to sell tickets and Florida around.
I've gone down there.

1803
01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:14.640
I've done what I can fucking do.
And all right.
Now people around the country,

1804
01:43:14.650 --> 01:43:17.830
like why speaking in that Redneck fucking southern voice,

1805
01:43:17.831 --> 01:43:22.210
you talking about Florida,
Florida is and part of the south.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.

1806
01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.950
If you get out of Miami,
that entire,
that entire state is,

1807
01:43:26.951 --> 01:43:28.570
is,
you know,
you could film

1808
01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:34.000
400 seasons of cops,
dog,
the bounty hunter.

1809
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:37.660
And if you have a really,
you know,
look at Dexter.

1810
01:43:37.661 --> 01:43:39.970
Dexter is his fucking taped down there,
right?

1811
01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:43.800
Isn't it Miami vice splitting.
My told me that.
What did,

1812
01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:48.700
what did they have on those t shirts down there?
Florida.
Uh,
what do they call it?

1813
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:52.910
A cool place for shady people.
Something like that.

1814
01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.630
Hot Place for shady people.
It's one of those play on words.

1815
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:57.770
I'm not good at that shit.
All right.

1816
01:43:57.771 --> 01:44:01.640
I'm going to be at the Improv Tampa in Tampa on a January 8th,

1817
01:44:01.641 --> 01:44:06.641
ninth and 10th and uh Oh and January 8th is the show your tits show.

1818
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.360
Just to let you know.
Uh,
that's something new that has nothing to do with me.

1819
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.770
You know,
I'm actually against it.

1820
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.250
I don't want girls to show me their titties during my show,
you know,
but,

1821
01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:19.070
you know,
it's something that the Improv's or coming up with,
you know,

1822
01:44:19.071 --> 01:44:23.660
I think it's sexist,
but you know,
I didn't want to cause any statics.
So,
you know,

1823
01:44:23.661 --> 01:44:27.140
just know that when you're showing me your tits during that show,
that,
uh,

1824
01:44:27.141 --> 01:44:29.930
you know,
there wasn't my call.
Uh,
I don't condone it,

1825
01:44:29.931 --> 01:44:33.500
but I was powerless to stop it.
So,
you know,

1826
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:38.360
yeah.
I guess I'll go along with it.
I'll sign some titties after the show,

1827
01:44:38.361 --> 01:44:42.230
you know,
show me a phone.
I mean,
whatever it means.
I mean,

1828
01:44:42.231 --> 01:44:45.260
I'm just there for the art,
you know?
Okay.
Uh,

1829
01:44:45.261 --> 01:44:49.220
and then after that I'm going to be a Improv and Houston,
Texas.

1830
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.550
January 22nd,
23rd and 24th.

1831
01:44:53.210 --> 01:44:56.370
I really excited to go back to that one because,
um,

1832
01:44:57.170 --> 01:45:01.100
I'm actually going to hit this guitar store out there called a southpaw guitars.

1833
01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.470
They have nothing but lefthanded guitars there.

1834
01:45:03.471 --> 01:45:08.210
And I'm going to go there and spend some money,

Um,

1838
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:24.920

1869
01:47:55.461 --> 01:48:00.380
I got some friends down in the way the man says,
and get out of here.

1870
01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:07.380
I said,
you know,
they refuse Jesus tea and he said,
you're not him.

1871
01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:10.630
Break your bones.
I ain't your pop.

1872
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.270
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for,

1873
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:25.340
well ran outside and I hopped inside cab.

1874
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:29.760
I went up the other door.
This Englishman said,
Fab,

1875
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000
as he saw me leave a hot dog stand in a cheery it fuck the cross from a

1876
01:48:36.031 --> 01:48:36.571

advertising brotherhood all ran right through the front door,

1878
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:46.320
but it was just a funeral planner and the mass.

1879
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:53.380
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.

1880
01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:57.840
They gave me his card.
He said,
call me if they died.

1881
01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:03.050
I shook his hand and said goodbye and ran up to the street when a bowling ball

1882
01:49:03.691 --> 01:49:06.600
came down the road and knock me off my feet.

1883
01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.150
The pay phone was ringing,

1884
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.710
just about blew my mind when I picked it up and said,
hello,

if foot game do the line.

1886
01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:25.020
By this time I was fed up.

1887
01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:30.180
I tried to make a stab at bringing back some help from my friends and captain,

1888
01:49:30.811 --> 01:49:33.720
a rep.
I decided to flip a coin.

1889
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:39.290
Either heads or tails would let me know if I should go back to the ship back to

1890
01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:40.553
jail.

Well,

1894
01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:01.140
I was ripping it to shreds when it's coast guard Baldwin as Mima name,

1895

Captain Kid,

1896
01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:11.041
but they wanted to know what exactly that I said for the pope of the roof was

1897
01:50:12.371 --> 01:50:16.680

They let me go right away or,

1898
