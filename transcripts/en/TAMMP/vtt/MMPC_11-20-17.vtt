1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.670
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.390
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for numb Monday,

3
00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:10.080
November 20th,
2017 right off the bat.

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.530
The first thing you should notice is my hushed fucking tone.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.970
That a hush tone,
a hushed fucking tone.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.940
Uh,
my daughter is sleeping downstairs.

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.770
It's like five 30 in the fucking morning.
And uh,

8
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:30.771
this the only time I'm going to have to do this podcast if I wanted to kind of

9
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.640
come out on time today.
So that is what I'm doing.
Um,

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.250
I was with my daughter all day.
Yesterday was awesome.

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.030
Nia went out with some friends and then she went out to fucking dinner and,

12
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.640
uh,
I just sat there.
We watched the Patriots Raiders.

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.950
I had taped the Celtics,
um,
hawks game.

14
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:56.610
I watched a little bit of the Dallas Philly game cause on inside the NFL.

15
00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:00.090
I said Dallas was going to win
it.

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.950
My only reasoning was divisioned rivalries.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

17
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:09.900
look how bad the buffalo bills got fucking raped yesterday by the San Diego

18
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.440
chargers for whatever fucking reason.
They're going to give us a tough game.

19
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.030
They're at least gonna cover this spread one goddamn time for the simple fact

20
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:23.031
that we see him twice a year going back to like 1960 back in the AFL,

21
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.810
you know,
so,
um,
I was wrong.

22
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.780
I'm big enough to say that I was wrong.

23
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:35.781
Carson Wentz I guess six foot five unbelievably mobile a bit.

24
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.380
Eagles put a thumping on him.
I'm a big enough man to say I was wrong.

25
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.220
I'm a big enough man to let you know that I'm sitting here drinking tea all

26
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.800
alone.
Um,
so yeah,

27
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:54.060
I just did that and was just a hanging out with my daughter do it.
She's amazing.

28
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.050
She really is amazing.
She is like all over the place.

29
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.140
You can say Mama now and she can say dot.
Dot.

30
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:04.470
But she doesn't know what they mean.
You know,

31
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.480
and she doesn't know when the word ends.
So you say Mama and she just goes Mama,

32
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.210
Mama,
Mama,
mama say data Joko like mum,

33
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:17.610
Mum MCHA come on and say dad,
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,
dad.
That,

34
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.110
that an important in myself.
So just smile at me and like the fuck is with you.

35
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:26.670
When she just crawls away,
she could stand,

36
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.460
she can let go with stuff,
still stand.
Um,
for good,
like a,

37
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:32.294
I don't know,

38
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.960
they could records like eight or nine seconds and you always think that they're

39
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:41.100
gonna like fall back and hit the head,
drives you nuts.
But some reason they just,

40
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.730
they sit right down in there.
But,
um,
I dunno,

41
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.780
I still don't trust the whole,
still don't trust the whole thing.

42
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.170
And uh,
I did the classic dad moment,
someone's bought,

43
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:57.171
somebody bought us a toy that I think is a little advanced for my kid.

44
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.320
And it was a,
you'd like the walkers that old people have.

45
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.580
This is like the same kind of thing except it's uh,
you know,

46
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.600
it has a smiling cow's face on it and sing songs on the front.

47
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.300
But essentially it's an old person walker.

48
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.820
So my daughter was pushing it around like on her knees first and then she

49
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.270
started standing up.
What I did was I put my iPhone slightly in front of it,

50
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.120
you know,
cause they love any sort of computer screen.

51
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.913
<v 1>MMM.</v>

52
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 0>And,
uh,
she was,
you know,
started taking steps with it or anything,</v>

53
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:33.900
but there's like no break on it.
It's like really fucking dangerous.

54
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.430
So I always have to be hovering over.

55
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.180
So the one time I go to film or doing it and no,

56
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:41.610
I'm not going to show you this footage.

57
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.623
<v 1>MMM.</v>

58
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.400
<v 0>She fucking starts to walk and I'm filming her and all of a sudden she like</v>

59
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.430
leaned back and the whole thing like tipped over on us.

60
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:57.380
She fell down and hit her head.
She was on the rug doctor capitated area.
But uh,

61
00:03:57.381 --> 00:04:00.890
if I were to show you that video,
you'd see the second she was in danger,

62
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.520
I fucking threw the camera down and tried to catch her as opposed to most of

63
00:04:04.521 --> 00:04:08.570
these fucking parents out there.
I swear to God,

64
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.500
it's like they're trying to put them in bad positions and then the kid falls

65
00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:14.120
down and you hear the parents laughing.

66
00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:18.070
They don't even try to help them cause it all giddy thinking like this is going

67
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.790
to get me a bunch of hits.
But I haven't seen this one.

68
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:23.331
There's some kid,

69
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:27.800
I guess somebody was telling me like hanging from something and falls into a

70
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:32.630
fucking fish tank.
Breaks the fish tank or something.
That's water.
That's glass,

71
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.430
that's dead fish.
That's the kind of shit used to get you sent to bed.

72
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.490
The second year parents site,
they'd be like,
dude,
what the fuck are you doing?

73
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.300
Okay.
They didn't say,
dude,
but everything else they said.

74
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.820
Now the parents just sit there and they,
you know,

75
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.650
it's like watching one of those nature shows,

76
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.010
like anytime they show a snake eating,

77
00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:55.880
somehow it always finds a fucking mouse Dina Long.

78
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.870
You'd have to sit there following that goddamn snake around with an entire

79
00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:00.704
camera crew.

80
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

81
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.790
<v 0>Think keeps turning around looking at,</v>

82
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800
you're trying to strike you if freaking it out.
Right.

83
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.450
Bless you and your camera crew.
We'll make an all that God damn nose.

84
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:12.890
You're going to scare all the mice away,

85
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.650
but somehow they always seem to capture the moment the snake fights the other

86
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:23.540
snake.
You know?
It kills a rabbit.
It kills a fucking bird.

87
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.280
I want to know why all of these fucking people out there,
right.

88
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.200
All of these animal lovers that talking about the Japanese beaten all those

89
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:37.010
dolphins to death in the cove.
They're talking about don't leave your dog,

90
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.000
you know,
in a,
in a,
uh,
in a car with the windows up,

91
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:47.890
all of that shit.
What about these mice?
Okay.

92
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.700
On these theses fucking nature shows.
I think I've told this before,

93
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.000
I watched one,
one time diff following this snake through the,

94
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.120
we'll say air quote woods.
Okay.

95
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.300
The snake is completely oblivious of the goddamn camera crew.

96
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.750
They must be just tippy toeing around bright craft services just off in the

97
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:10.400
distance,
you know,

98
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.510
so they got one camera team is following with this mouse.

99
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.680
The other team is following like this rattlesnake or something.

100
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.060
So the mouse goes down into the hole and then the snakes goes down in the hole.

101
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:29.240
And then next thing you know,
I'm in the hole to the camera.

102
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.900
These in like the giant living room part.

103
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.180
<v 0>The open area,
the great room,
the room over the garage,
if you will,
of this whole,</v>

105
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.810
okay.
The game room.
The man cave.
Right.

106
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

107
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.830
<v 0>And,
uh,
the camera's already in there.</v>

108
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.220
The fucking mouth sustain and they're like,
what the fuck?
You know,

109
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.050
like Joe Peshy,
Goodfellas.
Like,
ah,

110
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:56.530
now the second sees the camera and then the snake comes in and kills the thing.

111
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.700
I want to know,
Peter,
they're so busy,
you know,

112
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:05.840
wrapping themselves around some fucking half dead armadillo layman and the

113
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.970
streets.
Where the fuck are they on this issue?

114
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.810
<v 0>How in God's name could that camera crew possibly and all the fucking holes in</v>

116
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:19.310
the woods of all the fucking mice in the gather and mice in the woods.

117
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.210
I Dunno,
right?
Of all the fucking rodents in the God damn woods.

118
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.570
How the hell did they know that this fucking mouse was going to go down that

119
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:30.260
fucking hole and that snake that they will falling was going to follow that

120
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:33.020
mouse down into that hole ended that part of the whole,

121
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.833
<v 2>okay.</v>

122
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.460
<v 0>There's only one way people,
it was just set up.
Okay.</v>

123
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.470
Set up the same way they set up those sharks to look like a bunch of lunatics

124
00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:50.100
when they hang that fucking steamship round hanging off the goddamn boat

125
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.930
steamship round.
Everybody.

126
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.340
I told you I'd work it in just basically half the hindquarters of a cow.

127
00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.860
They got that hanging off the side of the boat,
right?

128
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.720
The great white shark shows up.
It's got that Arsenio thing where,
you know,

129
00:08:03.721 --> 00:08:04.411
when it smells,

130
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:07.980
it shows way too much gumps making it not as sympathetic character,

131
00:08:07.981 --> 00:08:12.180
which is why I think when they brought our cineo back,
it didn't last that long.

132
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.000
I think personally,
I don't think it was because of the talent of the man.

133
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.300
You know,
go back and watch coming to America,

134
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.890
going blow for blow with Eddie Murphy,
you know,

135
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.473
<v 2>right.</v>

136
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.750
<v 0>Saint Day with these great white sharks.</v>

137
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.420
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

138
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.090
<v 0>Majestic beautiful too.
And their fucking job.</v>

139
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.900
God forbid you got crooked teeth in America telling Ya

140
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.110
the mice have crooked teeth.
They get pointy teeth.
Right.

141
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.070
I didn't meat eaters

142
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.570
the fuck does a mouse seat.
It's gotta be,
it's gotta suck.

143
00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:55.330
When you figure out that in the pecking order of nature here,

144
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.190
you're just sort of this,
uh,
like a slider.

145
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.110
You liked this appetizer.
Like there's,
you know,
all of that share Christ.

146
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.340
They're fucking like rabbits.

147
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:09.540
It's like rabbits have to produce the way they do or a bunch of other species

148
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:10.374
die.

149
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.163
<v 2>Okay.</v>

150
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.120
<v 0>And I imagine some egg head with the lab coat would say that eventually human</v>

151
00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:20.200
beings would die unless we ate a plant based diet,

152
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.120
fruits and vegetables,
grains and nuts.

153
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.670
I'll get into this shit later on.
You know,
I,
I watched this video saying that,

154
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:34.450
you know,
meat and butter and shit and eggs,
dairy wasn't that bad.

155
00:09:34.451 --> 00:09:39.310
So you know what happens the second you fucking say that,

156
00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:43.810
uh,
you know,
this food isn't bad.
A bunch of people,

157
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.880
other non experts come out of the fucking woodwork and start telling you about

158
00:09:48.881 --> 00:09:49.870
the videos that they,

159
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.990
that they just watched and the shit that they think is right.
You know,

160
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.400
it's literally like these fucking food people in nutrition people I'm done with

161
00:09:57.401 --> 00:09:58.234
them.

162
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

163
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.721
<v 0>You know what they like?</v>

164
00:10:01.721 --> 00:10:05.940
They like religious people where they think God loves them best.

165
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.300
Their story about God.
Buddha,
Mohammed,
Jesus,

166
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.380
h o G.
H.
Right.

167
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.163
<v 2>Okay.</v>

168
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.360
<v 0>I don't want to start a race war here.
It's not a race war,
a religious war here,</v>

169
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.110
but you got to mid cheeses is the coolest stat of all of them.
You know?

170
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.910
Hey Man,
like you guys want to see me walk on water?

171
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.000
I mean just doing all these tricks,
right?

172
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.510
He's like a fucking lounge act in Vegas.

173
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.850
She's pulling all the fucking bread and the fish out.
You know,

174
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:42.900
in fairness to Muhammad,
I have not read one word about them.

175
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.710
I've never read the Qur'an.
I'd never even read the Bible,

176
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.660
you know,
in the afterlife.
I just hope I die in about in a group accident.

177
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.321
You know what I mean?

178
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:57.290
So that way we're all just kind of sitting there and I can kind of skate with

179
00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:01.560
the smart kids.
You know,
when the teacher would come in.
Did anybody,

180
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.830
<v 2>yeah,</v>

181
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.250
<v 0>read the short story last night.
Do y'all read it?
And everybody was kind of like,</v>

182
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:12.560
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Like try not to make eye contact then to do,

183
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.180
but start asking questions.
You like out,
fuck.
Come on man.

184
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.500
You start looking at the smart kid.
Like,

185
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.230
do put your fucking hand up and ask God damn quick answer these fucking

186
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:22.740
questions.
Listen,
my afterlife thinks going to be about,
you know,

187
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.260
I actually don't think it's going to be that bad.

188
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:26.603
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.130
<v 0>Cause I am a big believer that either you're just dead like that poor fucking</v>

190
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:36.970
mouse.
Oh,
the Arsenio Hall reboot the talk show.

191
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:42.280
She's dead.
I fucked that.
He's with my daughter.

192
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.040
I can hear her downstairs,
but she always wakes up this time anyways.
Um,

193
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.060
it's amazing when you're a parent.
The second you kids stirs in the Crib,

194
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:58.270
you fucking wake up,
still not getting paid.
I was sleep

195
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.320
probably what I'm talking about,
this fucking mouse right now,

196
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.880
five 47 in the morning,
Pacific coast time.
Um,

197
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:09.401
yeah.

198
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:14.401
I think either you're dead or you're just kind of show up and God's just like a,

199
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.270
yeah,
sorry about that.
You know,
it was just a big experiment.
I just,

200
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.731
you know,

201
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:26.731
I wanted to create a bunch of things that destroy each other.

202
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.500
I mean that's what happens.

203
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:37.501
If you do watch those nature shows the level of fucking murder that goes on out

204
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:39.064
in nature.

205
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

206
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.090
<v 0>Just all the time.
Does anybody die of old age,</v>

207
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:48.090
like die a natural death in nature?

208
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.980
I think like elephants too,

209
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.270
but even then they're trying to walk back to that place that they remember.

210
00:12:56.271 --> 00:12:58.910
And another always hyping up elephants.

211
00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:02.030
But everything that they fucking remember,
it's like I get it.
I get it.
The Smart,

212
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.070
okay,
I get it.
There's 30,000 fucking muscles in their God damn nose.

213
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.670
Um,
I'm just fucking with you.
You gotta love element elephants,
you know,

214
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.630
rhinos and hippos and the cons of elephants.

215
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.290
You know what I mean?
I can feel like an elephant.

216
00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:26.870
You kinda got a shot as long as their kids not around duck.

217
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.060
An elephant just kind of looks over it.
Yeah.
And it's just like I am at,
you know,

218
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.370
keep,
you can keep it distance.

219
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.490
Everything's fucking cool and rhinos and like hippopotamus is those fucking

220
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:40.830
things.
Sarah,
did I say rhinos and elephants?

221
00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:44.010
So the cons of the elephants that I said it earlier,
did I say rhinos?
Hippos.

222
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.820
I don't even know.

223
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.320
Just fucking early rhinos and hippos are the cons of elephants.

224
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.440
You know what I mean?
Little short motherfuckers.

225
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.160
They didn't get the long nose right.

226
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.510
Just one of those guys coming out playing pickup hockey,
a pickup hoop,

227
00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:02.040
and just taking it way too seriously.

228
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.880
And you just instinctively try to stay away from them before they blow your

229
00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:06.730
fucking knee out.

230
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.920
If you watch one of those animal videos when like the hippo is like chasing

231
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:16.130
after the boat,
going under the water,
coming out of the water,

232
00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:18.440
come on under the water,
coming out of the water.
It's like,

233
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:23.360
how the fuck is it producing that speed?
It's a tub of shit.

234
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.460
It's got a giant fucking head.

235
00:14:25.461 --> 00:14:29.660
It's not aerodynamic whatsoever and it's got those little short legs.

236
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.510
I think it's doing the butterfly.
It's definitely not doggy paddle.

237
00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:40.130
And when it gets going,
it's gotta be doing the butterfly.

238
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

239
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.430
<v 0>It's gotta be front legs forward,
you know,</v>

240
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.230
and then both legs at the same time and the thrust and back.
Um,

241
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.120
okay.

242
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.270
<v 2>Hippos like that fat kid at the pool who won't always goes into the pool with</v>

243
00:14:55.271 --> 00:15:00.010
his shirt on.
Right.
The fat kid in the fucking redhead like me.

244
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.870
I don't know why I never thought to do that.

245
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:06.280
I would just take the fucking sunburn.
It's going to turn it into color later.

246
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.140
Is it bill that are skin cancer?
Um,
anyways.

247
00:15:11.141 --> 00:15:14.360
How about those New England patriots?
Okay.

248
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.150
<v 0>Number one offense in the lowest rated defense.
I don't know about you guys,</v>

249
00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:21.250
but I think that spells success at January.

250
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.980
I'd have to look at the numbers and see how,
um,

251
00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:28.500
<v 2>okay.</v>

252
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:33.080
<v 0>Just see how they've been doing that over the last,
if the last few weeks,</v>

253
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:37.250
if they've been letting up less points,
you know,

254
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.880
like God knows we got the shit kicked out of us.
Not even,

255
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:42.770
it was just the final quarter and a half.

256
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.540
We get the shit kicked out of us by the Kansas City chiefs.
Okay.

257
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.320
And everyone was going like,
Holy Shit,
Brady is old.

258
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.030
Here comes Kansas City.
And uh,
now look what happened.

259
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:57.740
Kansas City just lost to the fucking,

260
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.233
<v 2>mmm.</v>

261
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.760
<v 0>New York giants,
the lowly New York giants.</v>

262
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:08.270
Whoever thought you would say that.
Um,
all right.

263
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:12.530
Patriots schedule results.
Yeah.
2014.
That's what I want to fucking say.

264
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:15.260
2017.
Um,

265
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.890
to what in God's name is going on?

266
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.470
The health scores at ease.
All right,
here we go.

267
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.210
What the hell is going on with Kansas City?

268
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:31.700
Like how many fucking times can you do this to your fan base?

269
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.440
How many times can you get these fucking people excited only to turn around and

270
00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:42.630
just shit the bed.
I don't understand it.
All right.
Preseason,
preseason,
preseason.

271
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.510
All right.
We gave up 42 points to the jets.

272
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.360
Then we gave up 20 points to this saints.
33 to the Texans.

273
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.470
33 to the panthers.
14 to the Buccaneers.

274
00:16:58.471 --> 00:17:02.610
17 to the jets.
Seven to the falcons.
13 to the charges.

275
00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:05.850
I would you want to right here.
16 to the Broncos,
but they stink.

276
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.280
And eight to the rate.
It's all right.
I think we're on the right then.

277
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.040
I thought I overheard that stat yesterday that we were last in team defense.

278
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.253
<v 2>MMM.</v>

279
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.170
<v 0>It's nice to actually see us get pressure on the quarterback.
Uh,</v>

280
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.360
I felt bad for Derek Carr though.
Jesus Christ.

281
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.210
I Dunno if the Raiders have been dropping as many passes as Tony Romo was

282
00:17:31.211 --> 00:17:34.180
suggested.
But how great is Tony Romo in the broadcast booth?

283
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.140
The Guy knows the game and he's not afraid to shit on people.

284
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.833
<v 2>I love it.</v>

285
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.681
<v 0>I feel like he,</v>

286
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:46.040
he's doing everything that people think Chris Collins worth is doing.

287
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.610
And Chris Collins worth,
I thought was always fair all day.

288
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.340
Right now the patriots are just not getting it done.

289
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:57.090
Our defects like I always felt even back as much as it was annoying to hear.

290
00:17:57.091 --> 00:17:58.890
Like I know Chris,
I'm watching the game.

291
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.910
He can't get mad cause the guys right on the other hand,

292
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.640
Tony Romo just take shots at guys.
It's fucking hilarious.

293
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.530
Like when he was sitting there saying how Tom Brady is the only player to ever

294
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:13.050
throw a touchdown pass in three different countries

295
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.320
being the United States of America,
uh,

296
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.640
England and uh,
now Mexico.

297
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.880
So Tony Romo goes,
yeah.
You know what that means?

298
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:29.700
He's a great quarterback and he's really old.

299
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.680
You know what I loved about it was funny listening to somebody make fun of Tom

300
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.680
Brady and then it was also funny knowing that you could just hear Tony Romo

301
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.340
pitch and do his girlfriend about how much attention fucking Tom Brady was

302
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:48.270
getting.
You know what I mean?

303
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.350
As he was trying to be a Dallas cowboys quarterback,
which God knows,
you know,

304
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:53.200
there's no fucking

305
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.720
<v 2>okay,</v>

306
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.400
<v 0>I dunno what it,
whatever,
whatever,</v>

307
00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.600
no good deed goes unpunished when you're a a quarterback for that team.

308
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:06.730
Forget the fact that Tony Romo had like 11 quarterback coaches and like 10

309
00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:09.070
seasons or whatever for however long he was there.

310
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.833
<v 2>You know,</v>

311
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.990
<v 0>I bet he was just going like,
oh,
you know,</v>

312
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:19.700
every fucking thing I do in this fucking one horse Goddamn town that thinks that

313
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:24.040
this giant city
just gets scrutinized.
Oh,

314
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:27.250
but Tom Brady,
oh,
we sell fucking good luck and hey,

315
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.550
I'm just as good looking as dad guy.
Right.
You know,

316
00:19:30.551 --> 00:19:35.380
he's thinking all of that shit.
Um,
so it's fun listening to shit on people.

317
00:19:35.381 --> 00:19:40.381
I thought it was funny when he made fun of a Deion Sanders and that Deion

318
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.910
Sanders who was so above the conversation took the time to shit on him back.

319
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.710
I enjoy all of that.
Um,
anyways.

320
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.810
Hey,
by the way,
how great were the Mexican fans,
by the way?
You know,

321
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.610
I know a lot of Americans flew down there.
Well,
I guess we're all Americans,

322
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:00.900
right?
We're all part of North America.

323
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:05.250
All people from the United States of the Americas flew down for those games.

324
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:09.510
But um,
and the Raiders are the perfect team down there.
If I wasn't mistaken,

325
00:20:09.511 --> 00:20:11.520
I thought I heard the patriots getting booed down there,

326
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:16.090
which made me feel great.
Nice to know.
We get respect down there too.

327
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.650
And um,
I dunno.
I thought it was a great game.

328
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.490
I am a little concerned though,
considering we lost Andrews Center and then we,

329
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.910
nick,
not nick cannon.

330
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:32.680
Marcus cannon is out and then the backup to Marcus Canon also has gone down.

331
00:20:32.681 --> 00:20:36.820
So I don't know who the fuck are we playing next week,
but uh,
at they right now,

332
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:39.120
these patriots,
Sarah offensive lied better again,

333
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.280
healthy or that's going to spelled nothing but trouble come January.

334
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.990
<v 2>Hang on.
It's my daughter's still.</v>

335
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.250
<v 3>Oh,
Jesus Christ didn't take him waking her up.</v>

336
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.290
She's still downstairs making noise.
I got to talk even quieter.
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.590
I'll turn up the volume.
I'll turn everything up.
There we go.

338
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.960
Why don't you use the volume bill to your fucking advantage around,

339
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:05.794
I'm going to Westbrook,

340
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.680
not the breast as I swear to God the first Westbend podcast ever.
Um,

341
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.160
I'm not going to do that to you.
Okay.
All right.
I would never do that team.

342
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.850
Um,
all right,
let's talk about some more bullshit.
I watch my first Bruins game.

343
00:21:20.851 --> 00:21:25.320
Am I in a half of two Celtics Games for the first time this year?

344
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:30.840
Uh,
first of all,
who are these 2017,
2018 Boston Celtics.

345
00:21:30.841 --> 00:21:34.380
I barely recognized anybody's face,
but all I can tell you this is,

346
00:21:34.381 --> 00:21:39.220
we're fucking young as shit.
Okay?
We kept chasing Tatum,

347
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.590
Ms Kits,
like fucking 20 years old.

348
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.410
We got Brown who I think they were seen as 20 years old.

349
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:46.420
That's our story in our starting five.

350
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.060
Um,
we got al Al Horford,
you know,

351
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.730
he's like the Zit Anal Chakra of the team.

352
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.280
We got mark is smart.

353
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.490
He's still on the team and I don't know who the fuck else we go.

354
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.900
Some other guy on there.
Um,

355
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.710
and all I know is we beat the Golden State fucking warriors

356
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.970
and they barely scored any points against us.

357
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.150
I forget what the final score was,
but like both teams will,

358
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:19.070
like in the fucking eighties.
Anyways,
all I know,
if it was under a hundred,

359
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.290
we made the warriors play our game.

360
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.493
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

361
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.150
<v 3>We slowed it down.</v>

362
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

363
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.760
<v 3>Okay.</v>

364
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.530
And God knows if you can beat the golden state warriors in November,

365
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.180
what's going to happen?
Come January.
I'll tell you right now.

366
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.640
The Celtics won one game against the warriors.

367
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.150
Does this mean they're going to sweep them in a seven game series?

368
00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:45.190
They're going to start doing that shit.
Um,
I obviously think the worry is,

369
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:47.400
is still too strong.
I think we,

370
00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:51.450
I think we have a better head coach and Brad Stevens.
Uh,

371
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.530
but I also think we still have to get past Lebron James and the Cavaliers first.

372
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.820
I just said,
I forget who the other guy was.

373
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:02.160
It's the guy from the fucking trade there with the plastic mask,
Kyrie Irving.

374
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.400
I'm very excited to watch them.

375
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.880
I watched my first Bruins game and they share and I watched the stinker rule

376
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.310
against the fucking Anaheim mighty ducks.

377
00:23:11.311 --> 00:23:14.910
I think we beat the Kingston next night.
Um,

378
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.210
and I missed the game against the San Jose Sharks,

379
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:20.700
but I think Brad Marshawn is coming back,
but we're pretty,

380
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.680
we're pretty banged up right now.
Um,
but uh,

381
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.180
it's good to be banged up this time of year rather than the end of the year

382
00:23:30.181 --> 00:23:33.510
because that's when you play for the trophy.
The,

383
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:42.210
I'm sorry,
I'm listening.
I think she went back to sleep.
All right,
cool.

384
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.940
Jesus Christ.
How much quieter can you fucking

385
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.450
<v 0>damn kids.
I swear to God they spoiled Brat.
Spoiled Brat too.</v>

386
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:53.150
What the fuck is going on with the Kansas City chiefs?

387
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.310
I don't get these guys.
I just don't get it.

388
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.140
Now the saints are coming on,

389
00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:04.310
but when the saints come marching and they get fucking drew Brees and they have

390
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:09.260
a running game,
I actually fucking looked up yesterday.

391
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.560
Um,
but daughter fell asleep on my chest.
Right.

392
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:16.250
And it's just like all rookie move,
rookie move.

393
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.810
I should have had a fall asleep on the bed.

394
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:22.811
And then I could have got up and got on with my life for fucking 50 to 90

395
00:24:23.031 --> 00:24:26.870
minutes.
So she's sleeping on my chest and I'm just like,
well how do I,

396
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.530
how do I make this time productive?
And I realized I'm inside the NFL.

397
00:24:33.531 --> 00:24:37.280
How little I know about the players in the league.

398
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.810
I mean,
I was already working too hard on f is for family and I got the kid,

399
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:46.100
I barely know anybody.
So I started looking up the starting quarterbacks,

400
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:50.820
have every team trying to see how many I could name.
Um,

401
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.580
all right,
so here we go.
I swear to God,
I don't have them in front of me.

402
00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.960
I'm going to try to remember as many as I can.
Okay.
Tom Brady,

403
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.540
the greatest of all time up there in New England.

404
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:06.590
Plaintiff Foxborough and he got tie Rod Taylor and Buffalo.

405
00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:08.030
I don't give a fuck who was backup is.

406
00:25:08.031 --> 00:25:11.840
I'm not going to waste my time memorizing a backups fucking name.

407
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.630
All right.
Until,

408
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.840
until they do something until they win the fucking job.

409
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.510
Did jets have Josh mccown,
Eli Manning the Patriot killer.

410
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.580
The Egos got who?

411
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.350
Carson Wentz and in the alias Joe Flacco,

412
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.060
the name you give to the cops.
What's your name?
Joe.

413
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:40.460
Joe.
What?
Joe Flacco what?
Um,

414
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:46.100
oh,
then who the fuck to the Redskins?
Have you liked that you liked that?

415
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.350
What are his fucking name is just like 20 cars since I feel he's another guy

416
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:54.620
with this c name and it's not content.
Um,

417
00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:00.490
Cam Newton.
Dan.

418
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.180
<v 1>Okay.</v>

419
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:08.180
<v 0>Jacksonville has Blake Bortles Jamison Winston in Tampa Bay and then Jay Cutler,</v>

420
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.610
Matty ice in Atlanta.

421
00:26:14.611 --> 00:26:18.510
Drew Brees at the saint smartest weather.

422
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.340
Is it fucking,
uh,
the titans,
but I couldn't name any.
Anyways,

423
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:28.550
I just fucking try and I'm trying to test my fucking brain here.
All right.

424
00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:31.070
Then you go to the bangles.
You got the fucking

425
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.770
the redhead there.
All right.
The giant ginger.

426
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.450
Andy Dalton with the fucking hipster haircut,

427
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:43.980
mocking my hairline.

428
00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.360
<v 3>Uh,
and then the Brown,</v>

429
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.990
one of the great names and of all sports have does Sean Kaiser,

430
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.390
I love that name.
Is he a black guy?
Is,
is,

431
00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:01.380
is he fucking celebrating Hitler's birthday?
You don't know.

432
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.620
I don't know.
Kaiser just sounds like a fucking German officer to me.

433
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.670
I don't know why.
All right.
And what do you got?

434
00:27:08.671 --> 00:27:12.180
You got that guy out there,
uh,
for the lions.
What the fuck's his name?

435
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:15.330
Tommy Hilfiger.
I don't know why that name just popped in my head.

436
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.610
I'm almost won't come on the basket.
Eric.
Apple.
The fuck do they have,

437
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.640
I just went blank on his name.
Andrew Luck.
I see what the Indianapolis,

438
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.810
I know they got that dude from NC state backing him up.

439
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.920
Aaron Rodgers.
I know he's heard my ribs still feel why he's hurt.

440
00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.330
Um,
I don't know who the vikings have.

441
00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.870
The bears have some guide.
Mitchell fucking true.

442
00:27:46.871 --> 00:27:49.900
Bisky or some fucking thing.
Alex Smith.

443
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.780
Zach Prescott.
The fucking
Texans.

444
00:27:55.781 --> 00:27:56.950
Who the fuck do they get?

445
00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:00.940
I know there's some fantasy football people just rattle and what they get that

446
00:28:00.941 --> 00:28:02.260
kid from Clemson who got hurt

447
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.710
and then a Denver,
I always forget that guy's name.

448
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.640
Some regular name and his last name is like fucking oscillation or some shit.

449
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.980
I don't know who the fucking cardinals have the La rams have.
Uh,

450
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.760
the fuck is his name.
Jared Golf,

451
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.610
Philip Rivers,
Derek Carr.
And then this one killed me.
Cj.

452
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

453
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.810
<v 3>Beat hard jack off.
Murder your meat,</v>

454
00:28:38.811 --> 00:28:42.180
whatever his fucking last name is.
And then he got it out.
Russell Wilson.
See us?

455
00:28:42.181 --> 00:28:47.180
Not Bad.
That was bad.
No.
Ask me to name all the receivers.
I can't name anybody.

456
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:49.281
That's what I knew.

457
00:28:49.281 --> 00:28:51.920
I realized when I was on the inside of the NFL and I'm going to bore you guys to

458
00:28:51.921 --> 00:28:55.620
death,
trying to fucking get caught back up.
You know what?
Fuck me over.
I,

459
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.730
when I stopped collecting football cards,
I'd love to get back into it,

460
00:28:58.731 --> 00:29:03.320
but they won't do,
they won't just let you buy a whole set,
you know,

461
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.200
at least they wouldn't.
Last time I tried to collect like 10 years ago,

462
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.910
I think I'm gonna have to give in and start playing fantasy football.
No,

463
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.700
I'm just not going to know anybody.
Um,
all right.

464
00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:16.450
I need to just promote some things here.
Um,

465
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.490
I'm doing a benefit tonight at the laugh factory in Long Beach.

466
00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:23.030
If you want to come down and watch me do a headlining set and a wonderful comedy

467
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:27.450
club and watch all of the money,
go to,
uh,

468
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.470
go to the victims of the hurricane out there in Puerto Rico.
Um,

469
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.190
please come down.
There's some tickets left.
Alright.

470
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.490
That club has not been doing the greatest job promoting this fucking show.

471
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:44.350
All right,
so please come down.
I'll do a meet and greet afterwards.

472
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.780
I'll shake your hand,
I'll sign your fucking tits.

473
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:49.810
Whatever the hell you want me to do.
Um,

474
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:54.650
but I'll ask you first before I sign your tits before I get in trouble.
Um,

475
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.950
Oh,
also Jesus Christ.
Oh,
all things comedy.
We got our new website up,

476
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.660
redesigned it and all that type of stuff.

477
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:03.520
I couldn't find the TV shows that we've made yet.

478
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:07.990
Those things should be coming up soon too.
So please check that out.
All things,

479
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:10.420
comedy.com and uh,

480
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.940
now for some sad news,
I even sat just an amazing life.

481
00:30:15.941 --> 00:30:20.560
Malcolm Young of ACDC passed away and all the football,

482
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:24.970
I watched Jesse in the NFL.
I was a little perturbed.

483
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.280
That was a little annoyed that there wasn't any sort of tribute to Malcolm young

484
00:30:30.281 --> 00:30:31.210
considering

485
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.220
he's arguably the greatest rock and roll rhythm guitarist of all time.

486
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.330
He's written so many classic rifts.

487
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:48.240
All of those ACDC albums and there's like four or five that are just absolute

488
00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:51.770
masterpieces.
They're all great,

489
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.390
but he has five fucking masterpieces.
All right.

490
00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.470
As much as I love pink Floyd,
as much as I love led Zeppelin,

491
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:04.780
I mean they're right there with them.
Masterpiece highway,

492
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:09.781
would it help masterpiece back in black masterpiece but to be rock masturbation,

493
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:17.320
power age,
masterpiece,
flick of the switch masterpiece.
Alright.

494
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.670
And if you don't fucking think they are,
it's because you're not.

495
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.690
You don't know it.
You know,
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

496
00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.030
I even like for those about to rock,

497
00:31:27.031 --> 00:31:30.810
everybody was all fucking Luke who's isn't as good as back in black and shut the

498
00:31:30.811 --> 00:31:33.570
fuck up.
Um,
anyways,

499
00:31:33.571 --> 00:31:35.750
I would have thought the NFL would have done something for how many years that

500
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.560
they've been playing hell's bells

501
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.630
and thunderstruck and all that.
Getting their stadiums all amped up.

502
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.350
And how many years did his band,
you know,

503
00:31:46.351 --> 00:31:49.830
then come back on tour and sell out those same football stadiums.

504
00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.510
How much money is he NFL?
You know,
it's a great partnership.

505
00:31:54.511 --> 00:31:58.470
Dan made off of that band and during the off season when they tried to have

506
00:31:58.471 --> 00:32:01.140
soccer in their stadiums and the fucking place is half full.

507
00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.030
Who comes in to save the day?
Fucking Malcolm Young.
But this band ACDC,

508
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.880
it's some of the greatest rifts of all fucking time.

509
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

510
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.570
<v 3>You know,
um,
I was lucky enough to see him</v>

511
00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.390
how many times I see him.
I think I saw him three times.

512
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.700
I saw him in [inaudible] 86 and the who made,
who tour on the heat?

513
00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:27.270
Secretor I saw his uh,
nephew who's now in the band.

514
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.670
Then I saw them.
Uh,
oh.
I think I only saw him twice based on my black ice.

515
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.990
I seen ACDC three times.

516
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.470
I saw some of the Black House tour and that was the last time I saw him.
And uh,

517
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.350
he's just the coolest,
greatest,
yeah.

518
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.050
Rock and roll rhythm guitarist of all time.

519
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.193
<v 2>MMM.</v>

520
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.140
<v 3>Just the way they would,
they build a song.
I was listening to live wire.</v>

521
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

522
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.820
<v 3>You know,
only he could just make those chords sound so fucking evil.</v>

523
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.140
And the way he builds them it,
it's still gives me chills.
T and T,

524
00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.900
I dunno if there's just too many overdose.
The way that song bills,

525
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:12.850
I know everybody knows the classics.

526
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:19.000
I'm gone shooting the whole second side of powerage,
downpayment blues,

527
00:33:19.001 --> 00:33:22.810
all of that stuff.
It's just an absolute giant.

528
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:28.240
Um,
I dunno,
I thought,
did Google do a tribute to him?

529
00:33:28.241 --> 00:33:32.590
I mean that's the level of guy that dad passed away here.
Uh,

530
00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.820
but anyways,
thanks to him and his genius in that.
Unbelievable.

531
00:33:36.821 --> 00:33:40.370
But that was my band growing up.
I was actually laughing,

532
00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.470
listen to all that music.

533
00:33:41.471 --> 00:33:45.640
I wasn't believing like sad that he was gone because I think he lives like such

534
00:33:45.641 --> 00:33:48.460
an amazing life.
And um,

535
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:55.630
I was just thinking of all the fucking classes that I flunked in high school and

536
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.030
how depressed I was,
how stupid I thought I was.

537
00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:04.031
And then I want to just go out and I would fucking get my piece of shit truck

538
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.920
and I would turn it on and pop in that cassette.

539
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.070
And then I would just go into fantasy world that I was in their band and knew

540
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:12.590
how to play guitar.
And then I would instantly be in a good mood again.

541
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.240
And I used to always sing on multiple choice tests that I knew I was flunking

542
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:27.170
and I was just guessing and I was running out of time.
That Bond Scott Lyric.

543
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:32.240
Uh,
I don't even remember what song is from that.
Take a chance.

544
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.180
Why you still got the choice,
rock and roll damnation.

545
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.380
That song would be playing in a loop,
as I was guessing.

546
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:44.420
Um,
I forget what I got on my se sats.

547
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.580
I got like a 300 something combined and a,

548
00:34:49.581 --> 00:34:52.130
I'm going to tell you,
I tried,
I took a prep course,

549
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.670
I did everything and I just fucking shit the bed on it.
Yeah.

550
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.363
<v 2>MMM.</v>

551
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.450
<v 3>And I'd love to tell you people that I,
that had a major effect on my life,</v>

552
00:35:03.451 --> 00:35:07.310
but it didn't.
Um,
anyway,

553
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:12.150
so let's read some,
uh,
so breast and peace,
Malcolm Young,
uh,

554
00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:15.330
there's never going to be another one like it.
That's it.

555
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.000
I always thought he always thought,
hey,

556
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.150
Malcolm young and Phil Rudd with the two coolest guys in the band.

557
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.430
That was it right there.
Those two fucking guys.
Malcolm,

558
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.250
Phil Rudd sitting there with a cigarette dangling out of his mouth,

559
00:35:29.251 --> 00:35:33.390
just fucking crushing it.
I think even Billy Joel sent,
you know,

560
00:35:33.391 --> 00:35:36.600
that was the greatest live band he's ever seen.

561
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:42.480
Um,
speaking of which,
did anybody hear the Howard Stern interview with?
Um,

562
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.830
Billy Joel?
Jesus.
Fucking amazing.
What a town.

563
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.270
There's a guy I have to go see live.

564
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:51.930
I can't believe I've never seen that guy life.
I was such a Douche in the 80s.

565
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.890
If you didn't have a guitar,

566
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:56.610
I just thought you were the biggest pussy ever fucking watch this guy playing

567
00:35:56.611 --> 00:35:57.444
his piano.

568
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.400
Two parents pay for the fucking your recital.

569
00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.860
Meanwhile,
he's just total bad is,
I never owned this.

570
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:09.360
This is such a bad thing to say,

571
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:14.361
but I never realized how talented in what a Badass Billy Joe was.

572
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:18.600
I honestly didn't really even pay attention to the guy and silly started getting

573
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:22.530
hammered driving his car into the fucking front of people's houses.

574
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.523
<v 2>You know,</v>

575
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:31.390
<v 3>I remember when he was singing like uptown girl and all that type of shit when I</v>

576
00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:33.590
was an uptown girl.
Loves that song where,
uh,

577
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.950
one of those songs where you sing in like,
you know,

578
00:36:39.951 --> 00:36:42.200
he was in love with this girl across the tracks.

579
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.780
Like he was his bad ass guy and she's like,
dude,

580
00:36:44.781 --> 00:36:46.940
you this little Jewish guy playing fucking piano.

581
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.350
That's about as safe as it gets.
You're,
you're a model citizen.

582
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.063
That's what I thought.

583
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:59.090
I didn't realize that he starts getting hammered driving his car into people's

584
00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:02.540
houses and this is just trying to sit down and eat dinner.
And I was like,
Oh,

585
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:05.210
you know what?
I guess he is from the other side of the tracks.

586
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:11.060
Got a love of Booze Hound.
All right.
Speaking of which,
I'm 95 miserable days in,

587
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.680
I was hanging out with these two alcoholics his fucking weekend who are now

588
00:37:15.681 --> 00:37:18.770
clean and they are both sitting there going,
yeah,
you know,
I don't miss it.

589
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.530
I don't miss it.
And I was just like,
oh yeah,
I do.

590
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.840
<v 2>I do.
You know?</v>

591
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.670
<v 3>All right.
Oh,
look who's here?
Everybody.
Old Zip recruiter.</v>

592
00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:34.620
All right.
Separate crude,
everybody.
Are you hiring well?
Are you,

593
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.700
do you know where to post your job to find the best candidates?

594
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:43.440
Talk about the satisfaction of employing it actually is a great,

595
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.430
that is a great feeling when you hire somebody,
you know,

596
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.430
knowing that you put a fellow American to work

597
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.033
<v 2>right?</v>

598
00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:57.140
<v 3>No one you can tell them what they,
what they can and can't do.
No one,</v>

599
00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:59.300
you can lord over them.
Um,

600
00:37:59.301 --> 00:38:04.100
with ZipRecruiter knowing you can ruin their holidays with one simple phone call

601
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.450
and two of the best words in the English language,

602
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.480
you're fired with ZipRecruiter.

603
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:16.070
You can post your job to over 100 of the Web's leading job boards with just one

604
00:38:16.071 --> 00:38:16.904
click.

605
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:21.320
So you can rest easy knowing your job is being seen by the right candidates to,

606
00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.060
to how creepy is this coffee?
When I'm whispering then sip

607
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.610
recruiter,
I'm like,

608
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:34.940
that creep at work coming up behind you and your cubicle.

609
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.540
What are you doing this weekend?
Uh,

610
00:38:37.541 --> 00:38:41.470
then ZipRecruiter puts its smart matching technology to work

611
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:47.940
actively notifying qualified candidates about your job within minutes of
posting.

612
00:38:47.941 --> 00:38:52.740
So you receive the best possible matches.
That's why ZipRecruiter is different.

613
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.690
It's just different and it's okay with it.
Unlike other hiring sites,

614
00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.380
ZipRecruiter doesn't depend on the right candidates finding you.

615
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.690
It finds them.

616
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.870
You can even get a headstart on the interview process by adding screening

617
00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:13.350
questions
to your job.
Po.
Uh,
sorry,

618
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.990
I was checking on what time it is to see if I still have time to do cardio

619
00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:20.970
before I had to get on with my day.
Um,

622
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.400
Do you have a sex scandal in your past?
Um,

623

so you don't have to waste time sorting through a stack of resumes to find the

perfect fit.
This guy's perfect for the job.

639
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.530
Alright.
He looks sleep everybody.
He looks Hellickson.

640
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:42.900
There are a ton of online mass mattress retailers popping up these days.

641
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.460
Are there?
I have no idea.

642
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:49.830
All with a one size fits all solution to a better sleep.
Guess what?

643
00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.190
One size doesn't fit all.
Okay.

644
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.060
Some people have a round ass if somebody have a flat ass.

645
00:40:59.061 --> 00:41:01.520
Some people have long legs,
right?

646
00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.850
Some people that have abnormally big ear lobes.

647
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:10.710
Now you wouldn't think that all this plays a factor in a comfortable good nights

648
00:41:10.711 --> 00:41:12.120
sleep.
And I'm here to tell you different.

649
00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.140
He likes sleep offers something that doesn't exist anywhere else.

650
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:21.200
A mattress personalized to your unique preferences and sleeping style that won't

651
00:41:21.751 --> 00:41:26.250
set you back.
Thousands of dollars.
What exactly is a fucking sleeping style?

652
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:28.243
Uh,

653
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.680
you sleep reverse cowgirl like you're fucking possess.
Can imagine that.

654
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.070
Imagine if you fucking married the most beautiful woman in the world and she

655
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:40.520
just sat,
she slept sitting up in bed

656
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.600
like you go to sleep like at night honey,

657
00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:46.720
and she would be laying back in the middle of the night.
It just,
you know,

658
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.910
that fucking
instinct.
You have that.

659
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.350
Should I open my eyes right now?

660
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.470
And you open your eyes and you look over and she was sitting up in bed,

661
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.500
fucking sleeping again.

662
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.210
Can imagine the first night you reach over and touch on her shoulder like,

663
00:42:06.211 --> 00:42:09.210
hey honey.
All right.
What if she slept?

664
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.490
Sitting up with her eyes open.
Um,
Bill,

665
00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:18.690
what if you finished reading this copy?
All right,
go to helix,
sleep.com/bird.

666
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.930
Take their simple two to three minutes sleep quiz.

667
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.610
They'll build a custom mattress.

668
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.900
That would be the best thing you've ever slept on for couples to even

669
00:42:27.901 --> 00:42:29.790
personalize each side of the mattress,

670
00:42:29.791 --> 00:42:34.050
which is the beginning of the end of the relationship and just seem like we're

671
00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:38.550
not connecting anymore.
Know she said if she sat up sleeping,

672
00:42:38.551 --> 00:42:42.840
she didn't like the craftmatic bed on her side.
Um,
you're accustom.

673
00:42:42.841 --> 00:42:44.470
Mattress arrives for everyone.

689
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.740
Thank Christ movement watches

690
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.800
Mvmt watches pronounced the movement was founded on the belief that style

691
00:43:45.581 --> 00:43:49.720
shouldn't break the bank.

693
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:58.470

You know,

I just realized I have the volume turned up so high and they have to have the

699
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:16.490
Microsoft folks so close to my mouth.

700
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.650
I hope I don't sound like a mealy mouth jackass here.
And if I do,

All right,
that's it.
Okay.
Let's get into the questions here for this week.

720
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.800
I really apologize for the fucking West Marine,

721
00:45:33.801 --> 00:45:38.570
but what do you already wanted from me?
All right,
Malcolm,
everybody a bill.

722
00:45:38.571 --> 00:45:43.070
If you read this,
please refer to me as Steve.
Okay.
Steve reads,

723
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:44.563
I don't know why.

724
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:48.260
I'll never understand why my friends gave me such a hard time for attending the

725
00:45:48.261 --> 00:45:52.730
ACDC show in Madison,
Wisconsin in 2001 being a high school,
Sophomore.

726
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:54.980
ACDC with it.
Shit,
as far as I was concerned,

727
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.880
but at the same time I didn't give a shit about top 40 him and let my
classmates,

728
00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.940
no,
they had shit tastes ACDC never let up.

729
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.670
The most hard working band at the last 30 years.

730
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.590
They laminate a let down their fans

731
00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.250
that just queued up if you want blood.
Oh,
what a fucking song that is.

732
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.670
The drums are insane in that perfect fucking drum beat.

733
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:21.020
Everything is just a shit.
They said there's nothing better.
Uh Oh.

734
00:46:21.021 --> 00:46:24.260
Unless you're talking about the live album.
It's another amazing thing.

735
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.170
When I actually went to Glasgow,
Scotland,

736
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.320
I looked up to theater because I wanted to go in there where they recorded.

737
00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:34.580
That thing doesn't exist anymore.
Anyways,
wanted to keep this short.

738
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:38.890
Ope your well,
you freckled cunt.
All right.

739
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.590
I don't know what you didn't really ask a question,

740
00:46:41.591 --> 00:46:46.090
but I share your opinions on a ACDC and I've already talked about that shit.

741
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.170
All right.
All right.
Front flipping robot.
I actually saw that.

742
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.570
Hey there Billy 2000.

743
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:58.240
Did you see the video of the extremely agile robot that was going around the

744
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:02.110
last week?
Yeah,
it was kind of looked like a white dude doing flips.
Okay.

745
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.880
<v 1>Um,
man,</v>

746
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.400
<v 3>build this thing is legit.</v>

747
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:12.430
It's the first robot machine that I've ever seen where I thought I cannot disarm

748
00:47:12.441 --> 00:47:14.000
miss y'all.
Yeah,
it's total robocop.

749
00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:18.200
Even with the extreme flames or large amount of water,

750
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:23.780
I think it could kill me first.
You're right about all this robot shit.
Shit.

751
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.020
No one is going to be scared enough to stop this.
Also,

752
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.090
if we didn't make robots that could fight,

753
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.930
would we just be sending our guys into,

754
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.510
wait also,
if we didn't make robots that could fight,

755
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.860
why don't we just be sending our guys in to fight Russian or Chinese robots now?

756
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:48.420
He just went the exact opposite way.
Yeah.

757
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.950
This is how human beings we

758
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:57.200
out of fear and just the seduction of power.

759
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:59.690
We just keep making these fucking things.

760
00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:07.010
It would be great if somehow we could all just get on the same page,
you know?

761
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:12.640
So we wouldn't do this type of shit to each other.
Cause this is,
it's not good.

762
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:15.380
It's not going to fucking end.
Well it really isn't,

763
00:48:15.381 --> 00:48:18.500
but we're never going to get on the same pages.
So you don't,
when I,
dude,

764
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:22.910
I just sort of given to the fact that we're doomed to destroy ourselves.

765
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:27.740
All right?
And I have to think a robot debt has to be a quick death.

766
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:33.700
I would like to think that the Illuminati who is making these things to replace

767
00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:39.611
all of us because they totally fit the bill for everything that a little bit out

768
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:40.371
he wants,

769
00:48:40.371 --> 00:48:45.371
which is basically slaves do what we say do whatever we say whenever we say it.

770
00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.530
And what if we said for years like assholes,

771
00:48:51.531 --> 00:48:56.531
we like what do we fucking robots and what are the Illuminati do robots.

772
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.240
And they went out and they made the fucking things.

773
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.880
I just want to talk to all the nerds out there and everybody who thinks these

774
00:49:07.881 --> 00:49:08.810
nerds are harmless,

775
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:13.840
these are fucking fucking egghead nerds who are so fucking smart that they are

776
00:49:14.781 --> 00:49:18.950
going to destroy us because they are listening to the fucking sociopath's of

777
00:49:18.951 --> 00:49:22.100
society,
the people boring power.

778
00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.060
And they go out and they make these fucking things for them.

779
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:31.370
You stupid nerd fucking cunts.
Um,

780
00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:36.660
I mean,
what do you do if you're held captive by a robot?

781
00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.380
You just have to wait till the thing powers down and just hope you can find a

782
00:49:40.381 --> 00:49:44.550
screwdriver and just start unscrewing shit and just fucking ripping out wires.

783
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:47.190
But you know what they gonna do?

784
00:49:47.191 --> 00:49:51.360
They're gonna make these robots like the ones that are designed to kill all of

785
00:49:51.361 --> 00:49:52.520
us.
They're going to make them out.

786
00:49:52.521 --> 00:49:57.210
I like the same material as that door on the cockpit of a plane that nobody can

787
00:49:57.211 --> 00:50:01.380
get into.
That's what it's going to be.
Unless you have the codes,
man.

788
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.780
Um,
yeah,
that's all.
Uh,
that's all scary shit.

789
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.850
And back when I was

790
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.220
just a fucking guy who was married and I didn't have a kid,

791
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:18.580
it wasn't as scary because I was already thinking like,
you know what?

792
00:50:18.581 --> 00:50:23.320
I've had a great fucking life.
I really have done all kinds of stuff.

793
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:27.470
I got to
made a dream come true.
Becoming a comedian.

794
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:31.260
Everything else has been gravy.
I got a great wife,
but it's,

795
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.220
this is the kind of shit that I think that when I see robots,
I'm like,
you know,

796
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:35.300
I've had a great life

797
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.180
and that thing comes in and just grabs me by my throat just crushes my fucking

798
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.720
wind pipe.
That's what I'm going to be thinking.

799
00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.070
I'm going to be thinking this robot,

800
00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:48.650
as much as it's killing me right now was never going to know joy.

801
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:54.530
It's just going to no inputs.
Um,
anyways,

802
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.870
that's what I'm gonna say to the robot.
Yeah.

803
00:50:56.871 --> 00:51:01.460
At least I know what happiness feels like
10 pro,

804
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:03.500
but gets all mad.
Shut the fuck up.

805
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.840
But if it could feel anger than it could feel joy.
All right.
Sorry.

806
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.840
Okay.
MMP advice a lady requests your advice on men.

807
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:19.520
Um,
okay.
I bill,
how are you?
I love your work.

808
00:51:19.521 --> 00:51:22.700
Especially you're special and you're mm,
podcast advice.

809
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:26.150
I learned a lot from your advice about the male point of view.

810
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.490
That's really fucking feel like there's a lot of layers to that compliment and I

811
00:51:31.491 --> 00:51:36.470
would be grateful for your insight.
All right.
I Dunno why you're listening to me,

812
00:51:36.471 --> 00:51:37.460
but okay.
Here we go.

813
00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.860
I have no fucking background whatsoever other than failing a lot.

814
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.070
All right.
No professional background.

815
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.600
I am a happily married woman with the toddler,
baby girl.
Ah,

816
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.440
isn't that the best?
And I'm currently pregnant with another girl.

817
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.460
He hit the lottery twice.
Um,
I am writing you,

818
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.980
I'm writing to you because by listening to it seems that in general you feel

819
00:52:03.981 --> 00:52:08.780
that women have the upper hand in life.
However,
I disagree.
Well,
yeah,

820
00:52:08.781 --> 00:52:10.400
the grass is always greener sweetheart.

821
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:12.923
<v 2>MMM.</v>

822
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:16.610
<v 3>That is one thing that I always,
I do as feminists.
I'd say to them,</v>

823
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.350
is there any scenario?

824
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:24.590
Is there even one scenario where you can think that,
hey,
um,
you know,

825
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:28.070
as far as men and women go in this scenario,
it's good to be a woman.

826
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.500
They can't do that because their whole business model falls to the fucking

827
00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:37.460
ground.
Every fucking scenario.
It's still me.
You heard you're for us.

828
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:43.460
Is it everything out there is harder for a woman than why do you outlive us?

829
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.450
If your life is really that much more difficult than mine,

830
00:52:47.451 --> 00:52:51.500
why do you outlive a man on average by like eight to fucking 10 years?

831
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:56.360
Let me guess.
Because the man is doing something wrong.

832
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:01.700
Blame the victim ladies.
Be exact thing you don't want done to yourself.

833
00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:04.310
Do you ever think that maybe you have something to do with it?

834
00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:08.870
Here's a classic one.
You know when my wife leaves the house,
you know,

835
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:10.550
and I think,
I think cool.

836
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.200
I got the house to myself right when I leave the house.

837
00:53:15.201 --> 00:53:16.280
You know what my wife thinks,

838
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.980
what can I now text him and tell him to go out and go get me?
What can I add?

839
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:27.330
He's out there having fun.
Let me add a fucking air into it.
Um,

840
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:31.770
hey,
can you go to trader Joe's?
Could you just go to trade shows really quickly?

841
00:53:31.771 --> 00:53:36.771
The Saturday before Thanksgiving and wade into that fucking black Friday food.

842
00:53:36.931 --> 00:53:41.880
Fucking mosh pit.
Sorry,
that was my yesterday.
Anyways,

843
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:45.030
I disagree.
I think men have the upper hand in general,

844
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:48.210
especially when it comes to job prospects,

845
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:52.380
salary and sexual aggression.
So Jesus Christ,

846
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:55.290
here we go again.
Um,

847
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.720
what is sexual aggressions mean?
I don't even know what the fuck that means.

848
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:02.723
Um,

849
00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.750
I would agree with job prospects and salary,

850
00:54:07.751 --> 00:54:11.140
but I think the biggest fucking problem women have is you guys don't go out and

851
00:54:11.141 --> 00:54:15.820
start enough businesses.
You keep coming working for men.

852
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:18.160
We've been fucking you over since day one.

853
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:21.490
At what point are you going to become self sufficient?

854
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.480
And I feel like I'm not just fucking go,

855
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.260
I'm not like being like do as I say,
not as I do.

856
00:54:29.261 --> 00:54:30.790
That's what I did in this business.

857
00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:34.370
I am self sufficient in this business.

858
00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.430
If this business took everything away from me,

859
00:54:37.431 --> 00:54:40.100
I could still be a standup comedian and do my podcast.

860
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.200
I'm completely self employed.

861
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:47.440
Those two things make me the most amount of money and I could easily live off

862
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.030
either reverse.
I got a TV show,

863
00:54:53.031 --> 00:54:57.290
I have a cartoon calledF is for family,
but I was never dumb enough to be like,

864
00:54:57.291 --> 00:55:00.770
well I got a TV show now and quit standup comedy.

865
00:55:00.771 --> 00:55:05.630
Like I saw so many comedians do because eventually your show goes off the air

866
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:10.460
and those fucking residual checks dwindled down to like,
you know,

867
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.750
I get residual checks routinely for like under $3.

868
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:20.480
So,
um,
I'm trying to say this to empower you,

869
00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:24.080
but you know,
quit your fucking whining.
All right?

870
00:55:24.081 --> 00:55:27.380
There's all these studies out there that clearly show that women are smarter

871
00:55:27.381 --> 00:55:31.580
than men.
So if you smarter than us,
then you can build a better mouse trap.

872
00:55:31.581 --> 00:55:35.150
So get together with some of your smart lady friends and start a fucking

873
00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:38.660
business.
But for the love of God,
quit your fucking whining.

874
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:43.560
Everybody out there is eating a giant shit sandwich.

875
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:48.360
Now granted there might be less shit my sandwich than yours,
but make no mistake,

876
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:51.330
it's still a shit sandwich.
All right?

877
00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.390
But there's nothing stopping you from picking out the bread.
Um,

878
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:02.930
cause when you do start your own business,
um,

879
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.590
you're going to work more than you have to work.

880
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:08.630
That whole thing where it's like I will start my business and then I will

881
00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:13.580
delegate and it will run on its own and I'll sit on a fucking yacht.
Yeah.

882
00:56:13.581 --> 00:56:18.140
And they will rob you blind
anyways.
Um,

883
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:24.040
sexual aggressions.
Um,
all right,
but you,

884
00:56:24.041 --> 00:56:28.150
I think you guys make up more than makeup for sexual aggressions.

885
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.410
Whatever the fuck that means.

886
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:30.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

887
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:32.470
<v 3>Is that sexual assault?</v>

888
00:56:32.471 --> 00:56:36.860
Are we talking about were the ones who have to have an opening line?
Um,

889
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:41.890
I think you guys more than make it up with a divorce court aggressions.

890
00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.453
<v 2>Okay.</v>

891
00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.670
<v 3>And your whole fucking thing where you know,</v>

892
00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:52.410
I wish that women could just beat the shit out of guys instead of just taking

893
00:56:52.411 --> 00:56:54.260
every fuck cause an ass kicking.

894
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:58.170
It's like you know a week of Epson salt.

895
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.460
Do you go to the dentist?
You can put it behind you.
All right,

896
00:57:02.461 --> 00:57:05.810
but when a woman kicked should kicks your ass.
It just,
they do know.

897
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.480
They just take everything.
Everything.
The house,

898
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:11.520
the kids you could tar collection,
your car,

899
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.880
whatever the fuck you collect that you love,
they're going to make you sell that.

900
00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:17.910
Not even cause they need the fucking money.

901
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:22.680
Just cause they know it's going to put another fucking hole in your heart.

902
00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:27.300
Alright,
so there you go.
So here we go.

903
00:57:27.301 --> 00:57:30.330
I'm going to go fucking play my little violin.
As I listened to the rest of this,

904
00:57:30.331 --> 00:57:34.000
I agree with George Carlin,
my hero when he said 99%

905
00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:40.370
of all the truly horrifying shit going on in this world was initiated,

906
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:44.210
established,
perpetrated,
enabled or continued by men.

907
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.311
Yeah,
absolutely.

908
00:57:46.311 --> 00:57:49.310
But that's only because women haven't been given an opportunity to show how

909
00:57:49.311 --> 00:57:52.520
fucking out of their minds they are.
I gotta be honest with you.

910
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.160
I don't understand why to compliment a woman you have to trashmen men

911
00:57:59.080 --> 00:57:59.950
anyways.
He says,

912
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:04.660
and in the course of lives compared with men and women have far more to put up

913
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:09.100
with,
they bear greater burdens,
extra spoonfuls of Shit.

914
00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:15.250
Oh boy.
Um,
I don't 100% agree with that.

915
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.600
Disagree with Louis C K that men are the number one threat to women.

916
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:23.200
Men are the number one cause of injury and may hem to women and men are the

917
00:58:23.201 --> 00:58:24.820
worst thing that ever happens to women.
Yeah,

918
00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:27.100
but you can say that right back to about women to men.

919
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.453
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

920
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:31.380
<v 3>No one can fucking destroy a man's life like a woman.</v>

921
00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:35.020
Look at all of these fucking powerful men who,

922
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.870
who ascend the fucking mountain top and what brings him down

923
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:46.560
marrying the wrong fucking woman or fuck your life over worse than cancer.

924
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.490
Um,
anyways,
I do not,

925
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:56.840
I do not know any woman who is not done in some way physically and emotionally

926
00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.450
assaulted in minimalized by men.

927
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.050
I don't know any guy out there who's dated a fucking woman and hasn't had his

928
00:59:04.051 --> 00:59:07.980
hard fucking stepped on.
See what you're doing here,
sweetheart,

929
00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:09.930
is you just looking out your own head?

930
00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.713
<v 2>Okay.</v>

931
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.880
<v 3>There's the Yin and the Yang.
Okay.</v>

932
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:17.083
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

933
00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:19.160
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

934
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.760
I've never seen a happier woman out there then when she actually meets a great

935
00:59:22.761 --> 00:59:24.850
man and vice versa.
They,
there's,

936
00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:30.050
there's a positive way to look at this and in this age where they just

937
00:59:30.051 --> 00:59:35.051
constantly trashing men and we can just hashtag white male trash,

938
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:40.930
which is you're combining racism and sexism and you're being called a fucking

939
00:59:41.331 --> 00:59:45.650
hero about it.
I don't get it unless you're just going to fight fire with fire.

940
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:46.760
I don't know.
So anyways,

941
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:51.230
I would like to teach my daughters to defend themselves from physical aggression

942
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:54.860
and belittling comments from men.
Now this I agree with,
yeah,

943
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.590
it's called fucking MMA.

944
00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:02.490
Get your kid involved in mixed martial arts.

945
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.070
Get your kid involved in sports,

946
01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.870
big believer in that.
Um,
however,

947
01:00:10.871 --> 01:00:15.580
I do not do not want to make them biased against men as I want to raise

948
01:00:15.581 --> 01:00:16.151
confident,

949
01:00:16.151 --> 01:00:20.980
polite women who view men as their equal but no one to defend themselves when

950
01:00:20.981 --> 01:00:23.650
necessary.
Um,

951
01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.800
well I gotta be honest with you.
Uh,

952
01:00:26.801 --> 01:00:31.780
if you've looked at the millennial generation,
they've turned Manhattan into bed,

953
01:00:31.781 --> 01:00:35.230
bath and beyond the vibe.
I mean,

954
01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:39.040
older generations literally turned it into a giant bed bath and beyond bud.
Like,

955
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.750
I mean,
I never thought I'd say this,

956
01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:46.110
but I feel like the standup scene is better in la than it is in New York,

957
01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:51.540
just as far as the grown factor.
I get way more groans in New York City.

958
01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:55.710
It's unreal.
Um,
anyways,

959
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.390
uh,

960
01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.720
you had a dollar recently and I would love to know your opinion on what you will

961
01:01:00.721 --> 01:01:04.260
say to your daughter about defending themselves without making them psychotic or

962
01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:07.260
biased against men because of the news.

963
01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.790
The me too movement.
The wage cap in my own personal experiences,

964
01:01:11.791 --> 01:01:15.930
unfortunately I find myself more and more and enraged with the opposite sex.

965
01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:20.310
Yeah.
That's because you're just being inundated with these fucking images.

966
01:01:20.311 --> 01:01:22.650
It's also why you probably think everybody in the Middle East,

967
01:01:22.651 --> 01:01:25.560
it's a fucking terrorist because that's all they're showing.

968
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:28.643
<v 2>You know,</v>

969
01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.320
<v 3>social media is a massive failure and there's all these studies coming out now</v>

970
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:39.710
that show that it actually,
it,
you know,
it makes you angry,

971
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:44.670
it makes you depressed.
It's not a good thing.
Um,

972
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:45.630
anyways,

973
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:48.980
I certainly do not want to pass that onto my daughter under any circumstances.

974
01:01:48.981 --> 01:01:50.960
I've talked to my husband a little bit about this,

975
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:54.500
but I do not want to tell them the extent of my disappointment in the male

976
01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:58.220
species because I plan to stay with them for the rest of my life.

977
01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:02.450
I would love to know your opinion and especially you defensive men so that I

978
01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:07.010
have a different point of view any more but balanced opinion of men that I can

979
01:02:07.011 --> 01:02:10.970
pass on to my daughter when I grow up.
Thank you very much psi and from Spain.

980
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:14.600
And I apologize for any grammatical or spelling errors as my English is not my

981
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:18.410
native language.
Um,
well first of all,

982
01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.540
um,

983
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:23.703
<v 1>like</v>

984
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.640
<v 3>the way that you wrote all of this and just sit in there,</v>

985
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:31.641
treat and say one good fucking thing that men do and our even trashing men to

986
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:35.010
the level that you do.
You still playing the victim here.

987
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:40.110
And I have to sit here and do some tap dance for you to try to figure out why

988
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:45.000
your fucking life is actually also great because of men.
Go Fuck Yourself.

989
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:50.940
It's not my job to not make you a sexist content.

990
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:56.430
All right?
I get it.
You hate men.
What am,
what am I going to do?

991
01:02:56.810 --> 01:02:59.340
They evidently you don't like central air conditioning.

992
01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.560
He all modes of transportation,
modern medicine,

993
01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:09.990
fucking some of the greatest music ever produced.
I mean,
we,
we,

994
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.090
we have done some good things out there.

995
01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:14.720
<v 1>Okay?</v>

996
01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.441
<v 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

997
01:03:15.441 --> 01:03:19.310
a couple of flashes and a few thousand fucking wars and all of a sudden all your

998
01:03:19.311 --> 01:03:22.220
good deeds are just gone.
I don't know what to tell you.

999
01:03:22.221 --> 01:03:25.520
All I can tell you is I feel bad for your daughter and I feel really bad for

1000
01:03:25.521 --> 01:03:30.050
your husband,
um,
that you basically don't like men.

1001
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.843
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1002
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.810
<v 3>I gotta be honest.
She's as much as I trash women,</v>

1003
01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.800
I realized that most of my shit is fear based.

1004
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:40.723
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1005
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.820
<v 3>Because I grew up with a bunch of men that feared women.</v>

1006
01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.990
And uh,

1007
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:54.050
and then I also got into this business where most of us get divorced and I

1008
01:03:56.851 --> 01:04:00.620
watched
so much shit go down

1009
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:07.040
that is really fucked up and it's just everybody just looks the other way.
Um,

1010
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.100
but having said that,
the older I get,

1011
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.530
the more I realize,

1012
01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:16.180
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1013
01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.680
<v 3>How wrong I was about women.
All right.
Having said that,</v>

1014
01:04:20.681 --> 01:04:24.100
now I'm not walking down the street,
not having my guard up either.

1015
01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:30.220
You know,
I am a big believer is you should like,
if you're a nice person,

1016
01:04:30.221 --> 01:04:31.120
if you're a good person,

1017
01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:34.210
you have to let people earn the fact that you're a nice person.

1018
01:04:34.211 --> 01:04:37.610
You just don't give that away because,
um,

1019
01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:42.310
when you're a really nice person who's openminded you become a psycho magnet.

1020
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:46.600
And some of the worst people ever are going to really going to come into your

1021
01:04:46.601 --> 01:04:51.510
life because they need someone as nice and as forgiving because everybody else

1022
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:53.890
is not going to put up with their bullshit.
Um,

1023
01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.660
but a lot of shit that I've said about women has been 100% in the wrong.

1024
01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.100
Um,
and I understand that.
So,
um,

1025
01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:06.530
I don't know,
you kind of sound like where you,

1026
01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:11.531
where I was at about 10 years ago with the opposite sex and you're also kind of

1027
01:05:11.931 --> 01:05:13.550
making yourself out to be a hero.

1028
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:18.520
<v 1>MMM.
I don't know.</v>

1029
01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.830
<v 3>I Dunno,
when I see guys on stage trashing men like that,</v>

1030
01:05:24.831 --> 01:05:28.880
I always just think they just trying to get laid,
you know what I mean?

1031
01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:33.500
This whole fucking thing that oh man down days man.
Then that,
yeah,
they have,

1032
01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:34.820
we also done a lot of great thanks to him.

1033
01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.300
We also have done a lot of great fucking takes to,
okay.

1034
01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.070
And at the end of the day,

1035
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:45.400
to always be talking about women as victims and in these victim positions is not

1036
01:05:46.641 --> 01:05:50.330
empowering to women.
All right.

1037
01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:53.270
To just sit around and just say,
all of my problems are,

1038
01:05:53.271 --> 01:05:56.930
becomes of a male dominated society.
Like where is that going to get?

1039
01:05:56.931 --> 01:06:01.931
And then your solution is to just bitch about men and then hashtag white male

1040
01:06:02.331 --> 01:06:03.250
trash.
Okay.

1041
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:04.873
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1042
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.240
<v 3>As white male trash here.</v>

1043
01:06:08.241 --> 01:06:12.470
I can tell you we're not having any meetings concerned about any of that shit.

1044
01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:14.183
Um,

1045
01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:20.030
it just fucking talking to other women that believe the same way you do.

1046
01:06:20.181 --> 01:06:24.990
Okay.
In life.
If you want to get out of your situation,

1047
01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:27.720
you have to fucking take control of it.
All right?

1048
01:06:27.721 --> 01:06:31.620
If you don't like working from men,
start your own thing.

1049
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.100
All right?
I don't like working for other people.

1050
01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.940
That's why I do this and this is why I do stand up and we'll continue to do
that.

1051
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:43.470
So you always have to have that ability to be like,
well,

1052
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:45.980
that's the deal you're offering me.
Yeah,
I don't want it.

1053
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.980
Go Fuck yourself and you walk away.
So,
um,

1054
01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:55.890
what would you do for your daughter?
I would,
first of all,

1055
01:06:55.891 --> 01:07:00.891
I would not give her a probably 90% of your negative opinions on men because

1056
01:07:01.141 --> 01:07:05.670
she'll become a man hater.
But it's your kid if that's what you want.

1057
01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.310
And I would,
um,

1058
01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:10.170
<v 1>okay.</v>

1059
01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:14.820
<v 3>I Dunno if I was running shit,
I would secretly teach every woman out there,</v>

1060
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.320
uh,
mixed martial arts
and um,

1061
01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.260
and then that Israeli fucking martial arts shit,
we,

1062
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:25.610
you disarm people that have weapons,
you know,

1063
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.160
I think where they got a gun in your facing you that a little fun moving,

1064
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.070
all of a sudden you're holding the gun,
pointing it at them.

1065
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.043
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1066
01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.760
<v 3>Yeah.
That type of shit.
Um,
I would also tell,
uh,</v>

1067
01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:41.880
your daughter to never go back to a hotel room,
but the guy ever,

1068
01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:46.140
ever,
ever guys do not want to talk to you.

1069
01:07:46.141 --> 01:07:49.560
If guys want to talk and they go hang out with the fellas.
Okay.

1070
01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:53.760
They're trying to fuck you.
That's it.
And we ain't,
let's go back to hotel room.

1071
01:07:53.761 --> 01:07:56.310
Just talk.
That's just part of him trying to get you back there.

1072
01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.653
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1073
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.940
<v 3>I don't know.
I feel bad for your husband.
That's all I can tell you,</v>

1074
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:08.540
cause I just inserted myself into that thing.
So it's like,
oh my God,
you know,

1075
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:12.740
you didn't say one positive thing about men and he just wrote a giant fucking,

1076
01:08:12.741 --> 01:08:15.110
there wasn't one positive thing in there.
And,

1077
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.730
and the worst thing about where we're at right now is human beings.

1078
01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:22.580
She would be complimented on that and you'd be called strong.

1079
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:28.160
And that's the direction that we're headed.
Um,

1080
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.350
you know,
and you don't want,
I don't dictate it,
so
I dunno.

1081
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:39.030
I guess mixed martial arts and I teach her how to run a business and along the

1082
01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:42.150
way,
you know,
if you don't know how to do that,
I would learn that too.

1083
01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:45.870
So you don't have to work for men.
Uh,
for the record.

1084
01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:49.110
Men treat other men like shit too,
by the way.

1085
01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.630
And that whole feminist fucking idea that,
uh,

1086
01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:56.400
if a guy's a dick that he gets respect,
like,

1087
01:08:56.430 --> 01:09:00.450
uh,
it's the stupidest thing ever.
And no one likes a dick.

1088
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:02.070
No one wants to work for a dick.

1089
01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:06.570
And everybody secretly hopes the guy crashes on the fucking way home.
Hey,

1090
01:09:06.571 --> 01:09:08.010
you know what?
I loved about my boss.

1091
01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:11.880
He treated me like shit and I don't know why.
I just really respected him.

1092
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.800
Nobody likes being treated like shit.

1093
01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:19.020
That is something a woman made up because it fit their fucking argument and

1094
01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:22.650
everybody ran with it.
Yeah.

1095
01:09:22.651 --> 01:09:26.370
If you're acting like an asshole,
you're an asshole.
All right.

1096
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.910
Joe Rogan is going to get you killed.
The fuck is this?

1097
01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:32.940
All right.

1098
01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.770
I'm bill burr on the podcast 11 1617 you said,

1099
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.450
I still can't wrap my head around the fact that I can eat this much.
Me.
Oh God.

1100
01:09:42.451 --> 01:09:42.871
Here we go.

1101
01:09:42.871 --> 01:09:46.740
Here's another fucking nutritionist with no fucking background whatsoever.

1102
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:52.290
It's not going to tell me everything that I watch is now bullshit,
right?

1103
01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:56.730
Is that what this is going?
Okay,
because you can't bill,

1104
01:09:57.210 --> 01:10:01.110
I know you love,
I know you love your buddy Joe Rogan.
However,
your buddy,

1105
01:10:01.111 --> 01:10:04.170
the self proclaimed conspiracy theorists,
so am I.

1106
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:07.050
Is dead wrong about nutrition.

1107
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:12.060
All that meat and animal saturated fats will line your arteries with disease

1108
01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:16.680
laden plaque to not eat this stuff in abundance.
Minimize it.

1109
01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:20.580
Forget the notion of moderation too.
That's all horse shit.

1110
01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:24.420
This is right here at this.
I'm telling you,
they like religious nuts.

1111
01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.960
All of it is horseshit.
Explain the French then,

1112
01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:35.020
and they're rich diet and their lack of fucking heart disease over there.

1113
01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.520
That's it.
There's elements of truth in everything.

1114
01:10:38.521 --> 01:10:41.760
And the second you're going to sit there and tell me that your diet is the Diet.

1115
01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:43.340
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1116
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.840
<v 3>I don't know.
It's all horse shit.</v>

1117
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.230
The bulk of your cattle calories should be from beans,

1118
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.540
peas and legumes,
vegetables,
fruits,
nuts and seeds and whole grains.

1119
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.920
Crush waters and eat your salads as per usual of course,
but add walnuts,

1120
01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.800
pumpkin seeds,
blueberries,
mushrooms,
potatoes,

1121
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.590
sweet potatoes and Greens to your daily routine,

1122
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:08.480
as well as countless other whole foods of your choice.
Minimalize all oils,

1123
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.470
pro process foods.
Who doesn't know about processed foods,
meats,
dairy,
and eggs.

1124
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.270
I don't care where the fuck they come from.

1125
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.400
Like Rogan's elk from the mountains of gods or wherever the fuck he hunts.

1126
01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:25.290
Um,
go.
Nutrition facts.org now,

1127
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:28.410
did you vet nutrition facts.org?

1128
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:33.411
Do you know where this came from for all published nutritional science in all of

1129
01:11:33.621 --> 01:11:36.840
these steam peer review?
We're worldwide rural,
uh,

1130
01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:40.350
reviewed worldwide medical journals and science papers.
Yeah,
buddy.

1131
01:11:40.351 --> 01:11:44.270
They have blood money behind them.
Okay?

1132
01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.900
I'm not saying it's all bullshit,
but there is an element of bullshit in there.

1133
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:52.830
The food industry
fucking lines,
those people's pockets.

1134
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:57.540
He said forget the nonsense from the media advertising in these pseudoscience

1135
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.280
pushing fruitcakes like Rogan.
I know he means well.
He means well,
but he's wrong.

1136
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:07.740
Look at the works of Dr Joel Fermin,

1137
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:08.970
Dr. Michael Greger,

1138
01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:13.350
Dr John [inaudible] two will Dr. Dean Ornish,

1139
01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:17.490
Dr Cardwell,
I can even read this guy's name,

1140
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:22.200
Ellison and others just looking out for your buddy.
Okay.

1141
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:25.440
Tell you what.
Thanks for looking out for me.

1142
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.140
I'm going to do what the fuck I've been doing anyways cause I have low blood

1143
01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:30.870
blood pressure,
you know,

1144
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.650
I'm doing fine and I'm keeping the weight off.
All right?

1145
01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:38.160
I'm not going to just sit there eating two handfuls of fucking Bacon,

1146
01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.330
all right?
But uh,
you know,

1147
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.530
and I'm also not going to just eat a plant based diet.
I'm not doing that.

1148
01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.860
I'm going to continue to do what the fuck I'm doing because it's working for me.

1149
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:52.350
And with all due respect,
sir.
And no point there,

1150
01:12:52.351 --> 01:12:54.120
did you say you were any sort of nutritionist?

1151
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.050
You just read a bunch of shit that made sense to you.
All right.

1152
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.680
And then you also went to bike,

1153
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.760
you went to the,
the,
the mainstream fucking thing.

1154
01:13:06.761 --> 01:13:09.940
And that mainstream thing has a bunch of money behind it.

1155
01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.380
Okay.

1156
01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:15.710
From people in the food fucking industry that want to sell the food that they

1157
01:13:15.711 --> 01:13:16.544
grow.

1158
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:21.560
So that place is also naturally perforated or corrupt.

1159
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:24.830
I'm not saying it's all bullshit,
but there is an element of bullshit.

1160
01:13:24.831 --> 01:13:27.110
Would you not agree in that?

1161
01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.240
Is elements of bullshit and every fucking thing including this Goddamn podcasts.

1162
01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:35.960
I don't listen to me either.
All right.
And he's the last one here.

1163
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:38.900
Accidentally killed girlfriend's cat.

1164
01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:44.380
Don't know what to do.
Uh,
Billy chode,

1165
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:47.210
that's something I never found funny.
That word showed,

1166
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:51.910
it's like a certain portion of like part of the country that thinks is,

1167
01:13:51.911 --> 01:13:56.660
that's a funny fucking word.
Um,
which I believe is like a short,
fat dick

1168
01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:02.720
got myself into a little bit of a moral dilemma.

1169
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:05.570
I'd appreciate some advice.
My girlfriend of seven months,

1170
01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.850
seven months has an outdoor cat who was really smart and could always find a way

1171
01:14:10.851 --> 01:14:14.470
back home.
Anyways,
you can probably see where this is going,

1172
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:15.940
where I can see where it's going in the title.

1173
01:14:15.941 --> 01:14:17.830
He said he accidentally killed your girlfriend's cat.

1174
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.330
I'm driving to replace place less than a block away.

1175
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:25.810
Not really watching the road and I hit the fucking thing.

1176
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:29.770
Died on impact practically in two pieces a week.

1177
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.490
That's all we can all pray for her.
A quick death.
I hit the fucking thing.

1178
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:35.230
All right.
Uh,
but my

1179
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:36.840
<v 2>okay</v>

1180
01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.840
<v 3>girl had this cat for some four years and has a serious emotional attachment.</v>

1181
01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:45.090
I'm not trying to be the asshole who killed her cat.

1182
01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:48.810
So I had a couple of sturdy plastic bags in my car,

1183
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:55.180
a towel and a water bottle.
Sounds like you just came from the gym and I said,

1184
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:59.700
and a seven 11 and without getting into the gritty details within 10 minutes

1185
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.770
look like nothing ever happened,

1186
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.490
I chucked it into a dumpster a few blocks away.

1187
01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.190
Oh God.
Good.

1188
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.870
Get a car wash to be extra cautious and drive back to her place.

1189
01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.353
So,

1190
01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:15.973
<v 2>ah,</v>

1191
01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:21.490
<v 3>it's been two weeks and I haven't told her she's freaking posted at least 30</v>

1192
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:26.020
missing cat photos all around the neighborhood and anywhere even remotely

1193
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:29.440
nearby,
fucking crying and all of that shit.

1194
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:34.600
It's messing with my conscious and our sex life.
There's the Gulf,
you go,

1195
01:15:34.601 --> 01:15:35.770
you're selfish bastard.

1196
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:39.670
I feel like if she knows it's a dead zone,

1197
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.500
she'll be able to move on.

1198
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:45.190
But also with me covering it up for so long,

1199
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.640
I'd be in a good bit of trouble.
So to say the least.

1200
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:51.910
Help me out here on what I should do.

1201
01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:56.870
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
dude.
Uh,</v>

1202
01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:02.020
<v 3>the,
the SS coming clean,
that ship's sailed.</v>

1203
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.610
That ship's sailed right after you cleaned up the crime scene and threw it in a

1204
01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:10.670
fucking dumpster is what you do.

1205
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:12.620
You don't say a fucking word.

1206
01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:19.180
You don't say a fucking word.
It's over,
dude.
It's over.

1207
01:16:19.181 --> 01:16:23.890
There's no do you let her cry for two fucking weeks and you knew that it's over.

1208
01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:27.640
Um,
and then I'll see you after you got to ask yourself,

1209
01:16:27.641 --> 01:16:29.110
am I going to marry this person?

1210
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:30.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1211
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.970
<v 3>All right.
Here's the deal.
If you're going to marry this person,</v>

1212
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.060
don't ever fucking tell her.
All right.

1213
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.360
If you don't want to marry this person,
you got to do a,

1214
01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.150
you got to do a two for one here.
Okay.
All right.

1215
01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:49.160
You have to break up with her and then also tell her that you killed their cat,

1216
01:16:49.161 --> 01:16:52.610
but not in that order.
You tell her that you killed her chat.

1217
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.760
All right.
And then hopefully she'll break up with you.

1218
01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.590
Oh,
way too open with killing or cat.

1219
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:05.573
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1220
01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.260
<v 3>Oh Dude,
this,
this,
no,
I don't know if year this is around the holidays.</v>

1221
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:14.170
I think you got to do it.
No,

1222
01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:18.530
if you want to stay with her,
if you love her,
are you going to marry this woman?

1223
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:20.030
She's going to marry this woman.

1224
01:17:20.031 --> 01:17:23.030
Don't tell her you killed a cat if you're not going to marry a woman that I,

1225
01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:24.830
you know,
I dunno.

1226
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:28.910
I know there's a lot of people also horrified by this fucking story,
but like,

1227
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:31.280
I mean,
the cat was dead.

1228
01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:32.560
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1229
01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.460
<v 3>what were we supposed to do here?
Hey man,
you should have told her.
But I mean,</v>

1230
01:17:35.461 --> 01:17:38.340
as far as like throwing the thing in the dumpster,
I mean,

1231
01:17:38.341 --> 01:17:40.740
if I die and somebody shows me a dump,
so I don't give a shit.

1232
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:43.830
My biggest concern is how bad I'm going to smell it.
That parking lot.

1233
01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:46.320
Other than that,
I'm dead.

1234
01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:52.800
Don't need some fancy fucking box.
You know,

1235
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:56.340
I don't understand that.
When people die and they put them in these,

1236
01:17:56.370 --> 01:18:00.810
these beautiful fucking caskets,
it's like,
it's a piece of fruit that went bad,

1237
01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:05.760
you know,
and you're putting it on display,
throwing the fucking trash.
All right,

1238
01:18:05.761 --> 01:18:08.580
that's disgusting.
Okay.
That's the end of the podcast here.

1239
01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.620
I'm happy thanksgiving.
Everybody do your cardio,
eat your salads.

1240
01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:19.080
Um,
go nuts on thanksgiving,
but hit it again right on Friday.
Alright,

1241
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.110
get after it.
Um,

1242
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:25.490
I wish I could actually meet that woman from Spain and we could sit down and I

1243
01:18:25.491 --> 01:18:28.770
talk about all my fucking women hating shit and she could talk about our guy

1244
01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:32.540
hate should,
maybe we can fucking find a middle ground,
um,

1245
01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:35.760
before we both fuck up our daughters.
Um,
no,

1246
01:18:35.761 --> 01:18:39.330
I would never say anything negative about women to my daughter.
I would.

1247
01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.130
All right.
That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.

1248
01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:45.240
Happy Turkey day and I'll check in on you on Thanksgiving.
Look at that.

1249
01:18:45.241 --> 01:18:47.130
And not even taking a day off.
All right,
I'll see you.
