00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.400
Hey,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.400
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:13.401
And I am chest checking in on you late Wednesday night while my daughter sleeps

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.130
in the next F and room.
Ma,
I got to keep quiet on this one.

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.130
I got to keep it down.
Keep it down.

6
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.190
I turned up the volume so I can whisper a little bit here.
Right.

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.110
I gotta knock this fucker out.

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.220
I got a table read for episode eight of Season Three,
eight of 10,

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.210
where 80% of the way there for you mathletes out there.

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.180
Very excited.

11
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.180
Starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel before the horrific editing

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.400
process begins.
And uh,
you know,

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.520
we'll just be working for another year and uh,

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.550
get everything all locked and I'll have maybe three days off and then we'll

15
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:57.594
start all over again.

16
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.350
BOMP bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp Oh,
Ludo too.
Um,

17
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.310
what's going on?
How are you?
I,
yeah,
how's your week going?
Is that all right?

18
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.850
I'm actually a,
if I do the table read,
um,
I got a bright,

19
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:16.851
some more shit and then late night I'm going to be traveling up to Toronto where

20
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:22.041
I'm doing three shows that the Sony Fuck and sat up Toronto,

21
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.680
one of my favorite cities.
You know,
I like,
I like a nice small city,
you know,

22
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.780
everybody knows everybody's name.
That's what I love about Toronto.

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.900
You know what I mean?
It's not this fucking monstrosity with a ton of traffic.

24
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.120
Everybody's down to Earth.
I actually really like,
you know,

25
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.900
it's the biggest God damn city,
you know,
basically for,
uh,

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.910
people in the United States.
All right.

27
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.040
Who never look up when they're walking around so they never see Canada.
Right.

28
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.960
He'd dumb like me were north to you is looking up cause you can't fucking,

29
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.400
you have no spatial relation to how you stand on this planet.
Um,

30
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.130
it was the capital of Canada,
but Toronto is,
is like,

31
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.790
it's kind of like how Albany is like the capital of New York,

32
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:10.110
but it's all about New York City.
Albany is the capital of New York state,

33
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:14.130
I should say it.
Sure.
They have the egg,
you know,

34
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.290
they have a fuck in minor league hockey team.

35
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.190
There's a lot to like an Albany got some beautiful theaters.

36
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.190
You know what I mean?
They got that fucking,

37
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:27.900
we used to build shit here before it all left,
you know,
for 30 years.

38
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:31.380
And now we're coming back around with a little tech savvy horse shit,

39
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.580
like all these fucking rust belt cities.
Not Saying Albany was in the rust belt,

40
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.580
but I'll look it up,
look up,
look up what's going on in Pittsburgh.

41
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.400
The revitalization of the downtown area is all these fucking nerds who make

42
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:49.380
websites and uh,
robots and you know,
synthetic heroin,

43
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:53.850
whatever the fuck it is these nerds do for these sociopaths,

44
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.830
for these fucking sociopath.
That's how it works.
Nerds.
I saw that.

45
00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:02.050
My Act nerds make fucking sociopath dreams come true.

46
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.250
That's what the fuck they do.
Okay.
Sociopath's are crazy enough to think shit,

47
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:09.430
but they need a nerd to actually make it a fucking reality.

48
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.000
And nerds do not have the background to backbone,
I should say.

49
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.690
They don't have the backbone to tell fucking sociopath's.
You know what,
Dude,

50
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.460
I know I could figure out how to do that,
but I'm not going to make that.

51
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.620
They won't do it.
They won't do it.

52
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.630
And they're all sitting around making robots that they can fuck right now to get

53
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:32.950
rid of that guilt.
Okay.
And we're taking,
callers were taking,

54
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.540
callers will read them live.
Um,
Toronto.

55
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.310
What's it doing to Rob Toronto?
Sorry,

56
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.520
just had some fucking corn checks.
Um,
by the way,

57
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.620
I haven't been working out cause my cap was fucked up and I'm,

58
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.970
I'm still dropping weight just by not boozing and eating like a fucking angel.

59
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.970
Do you know what I have every fucking night?

60
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Like probably four out of seven nights a week at this premade to bully salad

61
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.230
that has this little,
I don't know if it's Coos,
coos,

62
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.570
I don't know what the fuck it is.
Tomatoes and onions in it.

63
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:12.571
And then I put a little fucking chicken in there and I just eat that shit.

64
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.980
Like the fuel that it is,

65
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.990
I just shovel it into my mouth to stop the,
the hunger feeling.

66
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.900
And that's around five 30 at six.

67
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.000
And then I don't do anything and if I get a little extra hug,

68
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:26.050
it did it set tonight,
you know,

69
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:27.960
burned a little calories and every once in a while I'll come home.

70
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.060
I just have a fucking bowl of cereal and then that's it.
I have to tell you,
dude,

71
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.420
I got to tell you,
I got on the scale today,

72
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.930
old fucking Billy Alabaster freckled fat tits was down to 175 pounds.

73
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:46.630
I was up to a buck 85 I was a buck 90 last summer,

74
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.810
so I'm down to one 75 my fighting weight is one 72 I got this acting Gig and two

75
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:57.691
fucking weeks and I've been unable to work out by fucking rotator cuff is all

76
00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:58.840
fucked up again.

77
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.550
I was imitating this blowup doll on stage and I stuck my fucking arm out and it

78
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:08.010
started burning again.
It's like,
really?
I'm a,

79
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.180
I'm a God damn man.
I have to,
you know what I have to do.

80
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:13.120
I have to go to a physical therapist and I have to,

81
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.070
I have to start being in better patient.
Like,

82
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.790
you know when they tell me to do some shit,
I need to go fucking do the shit.

83
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.760
That's what the fuck I need to do to finally get past the shit cause I haven't

84
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:24.700
worked out.
You know,
I used to be pulled up guy.

85
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.850
I got a bet with Paul Versey that when I'm 70 years old and still be able to do

86
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:28.684
10 pull ups,

87
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.470
I won't even be able to do that when I turned 50 the way this is fucking going.

88
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:33.670
I'm what I'm trying to say here,

89
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:37.780
people is I'm falling apart and I know there's a lot of benefits out there.
Okay.

90
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.490
From,
you know,
people's who's fucking,
you know,

91
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.610
heads where fuse together with their brother,
whatever.

92
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.340
Whatever your fucking causes.
All right.

93
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.980
What about broken down middle aged,
white male heterosexuals.

94
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.970
What about that?
What of all about all of us.
Okay.

95
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.630
After enjoying half a century of privilege,

96
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.500
you know what about us with our sore calf and our sore right shoulder.

97
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.170
What about that?
How people,
you know,

98
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.350
I want to know how much you care.

99
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.860
I just want to turn a fucking corner with this goddamn thing.
Can't do it.

100
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.770
I haven't been able to do it.
I mean,
they're the rotator cuffs at a tough,

101
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.720
you know,
they gay kind of fucking lingo.
I know,
I know.
I'm living with it.
Um,

102
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:27.410
so my name's,
I've been talking to some people recently and you know,

103
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:29.630
I've always just joked around about pharmaceutical companies.

104
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.370
I keep hearing this rumor that they started the,
Oh,

105
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.060
this fucking heroin epidemic and everything and they just found out,
you know,

106
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.070
someone from like the town I grew up in 23 years old,

107
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:43.430
just fucking died of a heroin overdose.
I grew up in fucking Mayberry.

108
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.100
And uh,
someone was talking about like basically all these fucking things,

109
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.220
oxy,
Percocet,
all of that shit.

110
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:56.630
It has the exact same fucking addictive qualities,
chemical makeup,

111
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.830
all of that shit is heroin.

112
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.830
It's just like a synthetic heroin and a difference between an opiate in an

113
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:06.050
opioid and opiate is natural.

114
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.520
Like those poppy fucking things you always see in those chuck Norris movies,

115
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.710
right?
And then,
uh,

116
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.720
the poppy seeds there and then in a opiate is just like manufactured nerds.

117
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.940
Nerds,
you fucking go into the doctor like me,

118
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.400
I fucked up my calf.
This fucking guy goes,

119
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.470
all right and we'll give you a painkiller and I'm going to give you an anti

120
00:07:28.471 --> 00:07:32.210
inflammatory.
So I go to the fucking pharmaceutical.

121
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.940
Pharmacists are fucking hilarious.

122
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:38.750
The fact that they get to dress up like their doctors is one of the funniest

123
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:42.210
fucking things.
It's like,
what are you doing in there?
It's like you're,

124
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.340
you're basically working the Starbucks of the medical field,

125
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.810
you know?
Well,
what do you do?
What the fuck are you doing back?

126
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.050
You should get me a cup of coffee with my fucking pills.

127
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.200
They always act like they're so God damn,
you know,

128
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.410
just under the gun where you're back to,
you count an aspirin.

129
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.530
I get,
you know what?
Enough way,
you know what the fucking worst thing is,

130
00:08:07.531 --> 00:08:11.760
is when somebody like,
it's like running.
There's nothing.

131
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.020
People think cops are bad.
The worst thing you want to have fucking attitude.

132
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:19.130
Get a rent a cop.
Cars in the,
in the,
in the back of his head,

133
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:24.230
he knows he's not a real cops and now he's got something to prove.
A cop's a cop,

134
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:26.030
you know what I mean?
So He's,
he knows he's,
you know,

135
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.370
he's got a gun and he's got a fucking license to kill him.

136
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.910
I'll stick this right in the back of your fucking mouth and I'll pull the

137
00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.120
trigger and go down and go get a sandwich and I even think about it.
Right?

138
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.850
Fuck Rental Cup.
Where does he get maybe as a taser?

139
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.950
It got a little fucking stick.

140
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.910
So he's got to be some cut and run around taking some little fucking kid's

141
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:47.390
skateboard away,
right?
Th they,
they,
they,
they dabble in that shit.

142
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.530
So always that type of shit,
you know what I mean?
It's like,

143
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.350
if you're going to get it threesome right,
there's always the beautiful girl.

144
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.750
And then the other one who's fucking annoying,
who's got to start running a Yap.

145
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.410
Even if she is beautiful,
she knows she's not as good looking as the other one.

146
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.620
That brings up the insecurity and then she won't shut the fuck up.

147
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.640
She tries to be funny or something like that.
A stupid sloppy tits hanging out.

148
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.080
It's like,
what are you doing?

149
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.710
I don't care how fucking ugly you are.

150
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.700
You don't think I'm going to work my way through you to get to her to shut up.

151
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.390
I don't know what the fuck this has to do with pharmaceutical companies.
Okay.

152
00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:26.380
But I know when I went to this pharmacy with my calf problem,

153
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.670
all right,
I was supposed to get,
he said a painkiller.
I'm like,
well,

154
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:33.160
I'm not fucking with those.
I'm going to fucking with those.

155
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.480
I'm not getting heroin in a fucking synthetic form and start tailoring I,

156
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.820
but look how I handled beaus people,
or I should say,

157
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.160
look how Booz handled me.
Okay.

158
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.500
It was like triple G.
Walk it down Alvarez the other day.

159
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:54.100
That's what fucking booze does to me.
Backing up the whole fucking fight.

160
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.880
Maybe once a while I plant and I fucking throw a couple combinations.

161
00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:01.510
You know what the bottle does?
It eats it up.
Hey,
d eight sit up.
Right?

162
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.090
But my wife's sitting there,
gone here,
not an alcoholic has be winning.
One 18,

163
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:10.930
one 10 figure that one out.
So I fucking go in

164
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.570
to a CVS,
right?
Which is a great place.
If you need to buy somebody a card,

165
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.570
you know,
get a gallon of root beer and get some fucking heroin,
right?

166
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:24.670
Maybe some shit and fucking,
I don't know,
shaving cream or some shit.
Right?
So

167
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.430
the fucking,
you know,
rent a fucking Dr. Guy behind there.
He fucking,

168
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.250
you know,
it's,
you know,
it's going to be like 20 minutes.

169
00:10:33.251 --> 00:10:35.700
So I'm going gonna be like 20 minutes.
All right?
Okay.
Whatever.
I get it.

170
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.620
There's a lot of different colored pills back there.

171
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.660
You got to look at your pill chart.
See which color the blue ones are for boys.

172
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:46.470
And the red ones are for old people.
Whatever that sciences.

173
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.540
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

174
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.170
<v 0>they're,
they're back there acting like they make the pills.</v>

175
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.060
I need to shut the fuck up about pharmacists.
I got to read up on him here.

176
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.690
Farmers.
Let me finish telling this story.
Um,

177
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.880
so the guy finally comes back,
right?

178
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.420
I'm standing by and all these cute fucking old people,
you know what I mean?

179
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.730
For fucking people with all that God damn pills for the ailments and shit.

180
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.900
Um,
and uh,
he gives me two vials and I go,
okay,
what's this one?

181
00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:22.840
He goes,
those are the paint painkillers.
And I'm like,
all right,
well,

182
00:11:22.841 --> 00:11:26.560
I'm not messing with that.
And I,
and I go,
what are these?
And he goes,
those,
uh,

183
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:27.730
those are more pain pills.

184
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:28.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.490
<v 0>And I'm like,
well what about the antiinflammatory?
He goes,
oh,
it's,</v>

186
00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:36.030
it's in these painkillers.
And it's just like,
oh,

187
00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:39.310
I don't want that.
I just want the antiinflammatory.
But you know what it is,

188
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.270
is he's fucking drug companies.
They're drug dealers.
So they get,

189
00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:45.880
they want to get me hooked.
So you want the antiinflammatory,

190
00:11:45.881 --> 00:11:49.360
you got to do a little fucking synthetic heroin was with it.
Okay.

191
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:53.140
Now base in all of this on my own fucking paranoia and like two conversations

192
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.460
had over the last 48 hours.
Okay?
And now I'm in my fucking house,

193
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.280
like in that movie,
Beautiful Mind.
I'm taking fucking,

194
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:03.520
I'm cutting out headlines from papers that I don't read and up.

195
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.330
I'm blinking it all together and presenting it as fact to you.

196
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.990
Okay.
Pharmacists,

197
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.050
what do they do?

198
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

199
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.720
<v 0>Alright.
They advise physicians and other health practitioners on the selections,</v>

200
00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:25.710
dosage interactions and side effects of medication.

201
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.640
They also plan and monitor drug programs or regiments.

202
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.970
Pharmacist Council hospitalized patients on the use of drugs and on their use at

203
00:12:36.211 --> 00:12:41.040
home when the patients are discharged.
Yeah,
you made it the back of the CVS.
Okay.

204
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:42.780
Take two of these twice a day.

205
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.830
Take one on the third day and then flush the rest of it,
right?

206
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.133
<v 2>MMM.</v>

207
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.880
<v 0>Pharmacists</v>

208
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.630
level of edging toot.

209
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.830
Everything just pops up like I wrote what and then it immediately popped up.

210
00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:05.750
Do they do,
I said level and immediately of education immediately popped up.

211
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:11.340
Doctoral or professional degree.
All right.

212
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:14.970
Here's what you got to do.
There's no way this is,
no,
no.

213
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.440
This can't be more than a two year fucking program.
Okay.
Here you go.

214
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:21.630
Here's a video on how to be a fucking pharmacist.

215
00:13:21.631 --> 00:13:25.650
It's a fucking cartoon character in a pharmacist and a pharmacy.

216
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.380
Educational requirements in career center.

217
00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:32.070
Becoming a pharmacist requires a significant amount of formal education.

218
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.940
Get the fuck Outta here.
Learn about education,
job duties,

219
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:40.170
and trained to see if this is the right career for you.
Okay.

Okay.
Licensed required in all states.

224
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.350
I got one of those to sell health insurance.
That's not impressive.

225
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:06.360
You take a test and then your licensed experienced clerkship residency's

226
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:10.980
fellowships.
This is bullshit.
Key skills,
attention to detail.

227
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.940
Oh,

$121,500 given up for the pharmacist.
Jesus.
No.

234
00:14:34.801 --> 00:14:38.040
One of their lab coats is so God damn clean off the back.

235
00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:40.770
They're raking in the fucking money.
I'll tell you,

236
00:14:40.771 --> 00:14:43.590
if you start selling some of those drugs on the side to the people,

237
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.010
you get addictive in the front.
Okay.
You know,

238
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.140
just saying you get those fake tits,
they're sweeter,

239
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.800
died,
amazing weight.
This week I actually got to a,

240
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:04.300
I got to fucking play drums for about two and a half hours with a tremendous

241
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:07.730
musician who was just like,
hey man,
do you want to fucking jam?
And I was like,

242
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:10.910
yeah man,
I want a jam.
And I didn't even know what that meant.

243
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.400
I thought it was going to go down there and just be like,
Hey,

244
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.930
do you know highway to hell?
That's what I thought it was going to be.

245
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:21.220
I showed up.
This guy was doing that,
you know that Reggie Watts thing where yeah,

246
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.400
we fucking builds up,

247
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.110
he'll make like drum sounds and then I'll make guitar songs and then whatever

248
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:30.680
and whatever,
whatever.
And then he starts fucking singing over it,
right.
Uh,

249
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.900
he was doing that,
but what's like a guitar?

250
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.550
And he was just creating these songs and then I had to jump in and play drums

251
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:43.210
and it was just a whole other fucking animal and I realized that all these years

252
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:47.780
I thought that I played drums.
I didn't,
I like do drums.

253
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.200
I was talking about somebody who bought that today.
I like do drums,

254
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:53.360
I don't play them.
You know what I mean?

255
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.230
Playing them is what I attempted to do with the other night and failed

256
00:15:57.231 --> 00:15:58.064
horrifically.

257
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.230
See if you fucking listen to a song and you listen to what the drummer's doing,

258
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:04.550
you figure it out,
then you play it.

259
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.870
That's like getting all the answers to the test and then the drum part fit,

260
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.040
fix fits because the other guy already came up with it but you,

261
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.170
somebody just starts playing you a piece of music you never heard of and then

262
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:18.200
you have to actually come up with the drum part.

263
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:23.350
You are the level of musician that you are as immediately exposed and there's

264
00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:25.760
nowhere for you to hide

265
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.620
and that was just,
I had a great time.
I had such a fucking fun time doing it,

266
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.770
but I was actually thinking,
I was like,
wow man.
I knew I sucked.

267
00:16:36.771 --> 00:16:40.070
I didn't know I sucked.
Wow.
Um,

268
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.120
but it was a,
it was so much fun and the person was really,

269
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:47.050
really generous and I want to thank him for a fucking

270
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:53.190
hang in that long with me.
But it was such a fun fucking time and it was also,

271
00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:56.430
you know,
it was a very huge learning.
It wasn't,
yeah,

272
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.670
there was a few moments I actually thought I played pretty good.

273
00:16:59.671 --> 00:17:00.810
But other than that I was just like,

274
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:05.010
Jesus Christ just kept trying to do stuff and then,
you know,

275
00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:07.650
you just make that face.
Like I'm not bad at that too.

276
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.280
I don't know if you professional drummers can try and fill in you don't you fuck

277
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:14.730
up,
you know,
do you make a face?
Cause I always do.

278
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.950
I make that,
oops,

279
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.400
you don't have face John Paul Jones made when him and bought him fucked up in a

280
00:17:20.401 --> 00:17:23.280
song remains the same.
They came in a little too early.

281
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.010
But John Paul Jones says back to the crowd and you see bon and looked down and

282
00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:34.000
he just kind of shakes his head for half a second and then they got it right.
Um,

283
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.230
I don't know what I'm talking about.

284
00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:40.080
I'm just trying to fill up this fucking half hour cause I have no fucking time.

285
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:45.030
I have no time in my life anymore.
You know what I mean?
I don't,
I need to,

286
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.250
I need a pharmacist in my fucking life.
You know what?

287
00:17:47.251 --> 00:17:48.900
You know why I don't take those aside from the,

288
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.110
that I don't want to get addicted is uh,

289
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.090
<v 1>yeah.</v>

290
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:57.570
<v 0>What I like about drinking is I enjoy the effort it takes to get the buzz.</v>

291
00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.140
You know what I mean?
Like I don't like,
uh,
like we just seem so easy,

292
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.520
especially now with all these fucking vaporizers and stuff.
I'll you inhale,

293
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.810
you're doing that anyways.

294
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.010
Then you just sit there and all of a sudden Amy and blah,
blah,

295
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.200
like with fucking drinking,
you gotta drink it.

296
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:17.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

297
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.550
<v 0>If you're going to get shit faced,
just drinking beer,</v>

298
00:18:19.551 --> 00:18:22.580
that's a lot of Goddamn work.
You've got to drink,
eat,
drink,
at least six of them.

299
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.970
If you're a lightweight,
upwards of fucking,
you know,

300
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.450
I don't know,
36 to 40 depending on how about you drink.

301
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.090
So anyway,
anyways,
look at this shit.
So I went to this,
um,
this website.

302
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

303
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.190
<v 0>And it was like what is the difference between heroin and Percocet?</v>

304
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:43.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

305
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.540
<v 0>And this is like fucking nuts.</v>

306
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:50.040
This is like people who were like on these drugs talking in this,
this chat room.

307
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:51.780
Like what is the difference?

308
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:56.781
Someone told me I should buy some versus buying 30 milligrams of oxycodone

309
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.140
because it should be a lot cheaper.
So what are your opinions?

310
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.190
So many top basically told this person who is addicted to these,

311
00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:11.690
this fucking oxy,
they should now get heroin.
So this guy just,
this is such like,

312
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.870
like they're talking about cars or some shit.
This person says,
well,

313
00:19:14.871 --> 00:19:19.600
they are both strong narcotics.
Heroin is an opiate and oxycodone is an opioid,

314
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.140
which is basically in layman terms,

315
00:19:21.141 --> 00:19:24.920
opioids are synthetics and opiates occur naturally.

316
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.850
And the opium poppy and my opinion,
heroin is stronger.

317
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.710
But then that's countered by the fact that you'll never know street heroins

318
00:19:33.711 --> 00:19:38.550
purity.
And you always know what's in an oxy,
am I saying that right?
Oxycodone,

319
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.930
tablet.
If you buy 30 milligrams of 30 milligram tablet,

320
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:42.980
you know how strong it is.

321
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.520
Heroin purity can go up and down and they cut it with all kinds of shit.

322
00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:50.690
These are fucking people doing hard drugs.
First of all,

323
00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:53.690
I'm going to give it up that they could still fucking had the sense to go into a

324
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:54.524
chat room.

325
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

326
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.270
<v 0>And compare fucking notes.</v>

327
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.550
So there's a lot of people talking about this,

328
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:04.410
but not in,
not on CNN,

329
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:09.390
on Fox News or any of those other fucking so called news channels where they're

330
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:10.530
all bought and paid for.

331
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:14.520
And they're not going to do this fucking story because you know,

332
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.480
the same companies that get everybody allegedly got everybody addicted or

333
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:22.140
advertising on their fucking channels.
Um,

334
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.840
so all Hio is suing drug companies over their role in creating an opioid

335
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.640
epidemic,
which has led to an opiate epidemic.
Uh,

336
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.800
because after a while they won't fill your fucking prescription.

337
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.480
So NPRs Robert Siegel talks with the Ohio attorney general,

338
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:41.880
or just get to the bullshit here.
The state of Ohio figures,

339
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.100
it's home to 200,000 opiod addicts.
That's the equivalent.

340
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.440
The population of Akron overdoses are so common.

341
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.640
The morgues and some Ohio counties lack for space.

342
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.890
Today's Ohio today,

343
00:20:56.891 --> 00:21:01.270
Ohio's attorney general announced he's bringing a suit against five drug

344
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:06.250
manufacturers accusing them of misrepresenting the risk of prescription opioids

345
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.030
and helping to fuel an addiction epidemic in this state.
Yeah.

346
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:12.040
Like these people are like murdering people.

347
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

348
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.530
<v 0>If what they're saying is true,
that's what the fuck they're doing.</v>

349
00:21:15.531 --> 00:21:18.970
And these fucking cunts,
these corporate cons state,

350
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:22.970
they go to bed fucking silk pajamas,

351
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:28.280
indoor and outdoor pool is everybody's fucking died.
I Dunno,

352
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:29.843
the uh,

353
00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.790
population control person in me sorta like I'm on both sides of this thing.

354
00:21:34.791 --> 00:21:37.460
It's like,
this is fucking terrible that do to people.
Then it's also like,
well,

355
00:21:37.461 --> 00:21:38.570
there's 20 people on the planet,

356
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.560
so thank God these fucking psychos are killing people so they can get a bigger

357
00:21:42.561 --> 00:21:44.630
house.
I heard the like,
you know,

358
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.300
any doctors listen to this shit anonymously want to write in.

359
00:21:47.301 --> 00:21:50.390
I mean I heard that they have like these pharmaceutical companies,

360
00:21:50.391 --> 00:21:54.860
they hire these hot chicks to walk around to bring in the new drugs were in like

361
00:21:54.861 --> 00:21:57.650
fuck me pumps and stuff.
Is that true or did it,

362
00:21:57.651 --> 00:22:00.200
was I half asleep watching some red shoe diary one night?

363
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.000
I thought it was in this industry.
I have no idea.

364
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.910
So the State Attorney General Mike,

365
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.980

Jansen or Jansen pharmaceuticals.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.460
Cephalon and then Allergan.

378
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.040
Why the fuck?
Why won't you just summarize all of this?
I guess I can hit play.

379
00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:54.050
It's a five minute interview.
I don't have time for that shit.

380
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.930
U US officials are starting to treat opiod companies like big tobacco about time

384
00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:18.860
Only America would vilify the people that invented Viagara.
That's what happened.

385
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.220
That's what's happening.
Parentheses sort of.

386
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.380
They just bought back everything they just said this week is the FDA holds very

387
00:23:27.381 --> 00:23:31.070
public hearings and the potential health risks of popular prescription pain

388
00:23:31.071 --> 00:23:34.850
medication such as Cox,
two inhibitors,

389
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.690
Pfizer,

Celebrex is also the company that brought you in yours.
Viagra,

391
00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.940
drug companies,

The villains of medicine and healthcare,

392
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.000
at least according to much media.
Who the fuck wrote this horseshit.

393
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.170
This is by,
I swear to God,
booty cost Grove Mather.

394
00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.630
All right.

395
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.440
I don't understand how you can be anywhere in journalism with a first name
booty.

396
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:08.260
All right.
Have I,
have I made enough of an ass of myself talking about this shit?

397
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.193

but nothing gets my loins going.

404
00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:35.650
Like seeing another man walked by in a suit.

405
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.280
Something about hearing those slacks rubbing together.
Indochina.

410
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.260
<v 1>Okay?</v>

411
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.930
<v 0>Going to work is not a special occasion.
That's what the fuck are you up to?</v>

412
00:25:02.931 --> 00:25:07.300
A wedding special occasion.
Where are you going,

413
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.020
to a special occasion?

All right,

495
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:09.640
the last fucking read.

496
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:15.430
This is the last fucking re he dad I have to do.
Oh my God,

497
00:30:15.431 --> 00:30:16.420
that was a little Don Henley.

498
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.480
Remember Don and he put out that great fucking album,

499
00:30:19.481 --> 00:30:23.290
the late eighties what a songwriter.
What a showman.

500
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.230
A lift.
Everybody.

501
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.940
Lyft knows that drivers are what keeps them moving so they do everything they

502
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:36.970
can to make sure their drivers are happy on every trip.

503
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.480
Lift believes that being a ride sharing driver should be fun if you're having a

504
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:45.790
good time off,
so the passengers,

505
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.930
if you're choosing a ride sharing company to drive for,

506
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.170
go with the company that treats you better.
It's lift,

507
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:57.280
not like those slave driving bastards over at Uw.
At Uber,

508
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.270
you want to go with Lyft.
You get tips at this fucking place.

509
00:31:01.271 --> 00:31:04.450
The only tip she get it.
Uber is,
hey,
here's a tip.
You ain't making shit here,

510
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.630
so shut the fuck up and keep driving.
That's how they treat them over there,

511
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.570
right?
Lyft is the North Sea.

512
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.210
I mean Uber is the North Korea of ride sharing apps.

513
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.310
Live was the first to offer in APP tipping.

514
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.500
Can imagine a few are fucking Lyft driver and you picked up Kim Jong Il or maybe

515
00:31:26.501 --> 00:31:28.750
just somebody who looked like,
you know what I mean?
You're like,
well,

516
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.600
he wouldn't be over here.
He doesn't like us.

517
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:37.600
Maybe that's just some fat Asian kid who likes to have a Hitler youth haircut.

518
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.520
I don't know.
We go and serve

519
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.650
to the airport.
Lyft was the first offer.
Inept tipping.

520
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.420
When you drive for Lyft,
you keep 100% of the tips.

521
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:54.250
Drivers have been paid over $200 million in tips since the feature was

522
00:31:54.251 --> 00:31:55.084
introduced.

523
00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.300
Express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead of where you for

524
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:05.440
weeks,
you can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
One,
earn more money,

525
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:08.140
drive more.
It's never been easier to give yourself a raise.

526
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.440
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers means happy passengers.

527
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.090
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating

528
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.390
the others and in a fiery crash.

529
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.350
So join the ride sharing company that believes in treating people,

530
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:24.580
treating its people better.

531
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.820
Go to lift.com/burr today and you can get a $500 new driver bonus.

Fuck you.
I'll talk to you later.
Um,
honestly,

535
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.430
32 minutes.
Okay.
People,
I want you guys all have a wonderful weekend.

536
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:52.190
I want you to get on your knees and give thanks that you don't live in the

537
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:55.160
Caribbean with all them tornadoes coming.
Why don't we say tornadoes?

538
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.030
Hurricanes coming.
Yeah.

539
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:57.980
<v 4>Uh,</v>

540
00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.320
<v 0>everybody in Puerto Rico.
I hope you make it out.
All right.</v>

541
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.070
I just saw it was coming yesterday,
man.
It's fucking brutal,
man.

542
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.933
It's really brutal.

543
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.770
The same way they going after these pharmaceutical companies for a,
the,
you know,

544
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:16.270
the opioids,
opioids,
ob and cheese,

545
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:17.980
the Indochino s right?

546
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.820
They should go after fucking fossil fuel companies at some point.

547
00:33:21.821 --> 00:33:24.040
That's going to fucking happen,
you know?

548
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.950
But she can never get the people that made the decision.

549
00:33:26.951 --> 00:33:29.530
Because what you're doing is you're,
you're suing a corporation,

550
00:33:29.531 --> 00:33:30.940
which is nameless and faceless.

551
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:36.250
And then all those people who made those fucking decisions collectively turn

552
00:33:36.251 --> 00:33:39.220
your key.
They all turned their fucking key.
I was following orders.

553
00:33:39.221 --> 00:33:43.060
All of those fucking cuts when you go to sue the company,

554
00:33:43.061 --> 00:33:44.350
or completely insulated,

555
00:33:44.351 --> 00:33:49.060
and they will be giving themselves raises with their blood money.

556
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.700
And then when they go to fucking attack the company,

557
00:33:51.701 --> 00:33:55.210
everybody just fucking walks away.
He's like,
well,
I worked there.
I am not,

558
00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.240
you know,
I'm not the corporation.

559
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:05.050
Yeah.
Why are you still talking?
I'm sorry.
I gotta go to fucking bed.
Alright.

560
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.380
Anyways,
don't be a cut this weekend.

561
00:34:08.381 --> 00:34:10.570
Everybody up and don't watch the fucking news.

562
00:34:10.571 --> 00:34:15.130
All it's gonna do is make you feel fucking sad.
Go out.
Be a good person.

563
00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:20.110
You know,
somebody asks you to get in the trunk.
Just,
you know,
just don't do it.

564
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.320
That's all I'm saying.
All right.
Does that make any sense?
I don't give a fuck.

565
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.390
All right.
Uh,

566
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.580

All right,
I'll see all you people in Toronto.

572
00:34:44.301 --> 00:34:47.720
I can't wait to go up there and give you my brand new hour of fucking bullshit.

573
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.870
I'll be there with Paul Versey.
That dude,

574
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:52.910
I called a kid the pride or New Jersey,

577
00:34:57.421 --> 00:35:00.530

578
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:01.364

All right.
Have a great weekend.</v>

581
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:25.800
<v 5>I've got,
see what's,</v>

582
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.890
I'm just theme Fiesta Day.

583
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.970
Got Up the sand.

X Defense Minister from Canada speaks out about,
speaks,</v>

588
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.620
speaks about.
See,
this is what not.
Once again,
not my fault.

589
00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:33.621
This person writes x defense minister from Canada speaks about out about aliens

590
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:41.260
out about aliens or speaks out about aliens or does he speak about out about

591
00:36:42.201 --> 00:36:43.670
aliens?
See what I'm saying?

592
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.030
<v 5>Okay.</v>

593
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:49.750
<v 7>This isn't always me.
All right.
Bill loved the podcast,</v>

594
00:36:49.751 --> 00:36:54.100
freelance every week.
Uh,
they're much appreciated,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

595
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:58.420
I thought you might like this link as you're a big conspiracy theory.

596
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.060
A big conspiracy theorist.
You mean?

597
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.330
He said it's the former Canadian defense administrator.

598
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.700
No Canadian defense minister giving some bold claims about several species of

599
00:37:09.701 --> 00:37:13.390
aliens living among us and actually working with elements in the government.

600
00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.790
Uh,
not only that,
but a shadow.
We,

601
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.890
<v 5>okay.</v>

602
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.780
<v 7>Cabal.
C A,

a,
l,
k,
but k bell,
I dunno.</v>

603
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.630
Comprised of the council on foreign relations.
The bill,
the Burgers,

604
00:37:26.631 --> 00:37:30.670
the tea
trilateral commission.

605
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:34.900
That should add a hyphen in it.
You can't.
The international banking cartel,

606
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.930
uh,
the oil cartels,

607
00:37:37.931 --> 00:37:40.720
members of various intelligence organizes the select members of the military

608
00:37:40.721 --> 00:37:44.530
agenda.
This is the one world government.
Check it out,
sir.

609
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.910
The last thing I'm going to do is look at this.
I'll put the link up there.
Ah,

610
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:50.730
fuck it.
I'll look at it right now.
This shit just freaks me out.

611
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:54.340
It makes me depressed because there's nothing I could do about it.
Okay.
Now,

612
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.810
how is this gonna help me,
sir,

613
00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:59.560
if I find out there's actually aliens living among us,

614
00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.840
talking to international bankers,
you know,
am I going to come walking in,

615
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:07.990
bursting into their meeting like the end of a feel good movie.

616
00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:09.390
<v 5>Okay.</v>

617
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:14.220
<v 7>You know,
like,
hey man,
the people have spoken and they liked me.</v>

618
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.310
All right,
here we go.
I got it right here.
Uh,

619
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.820
Canada's former minister of national defense,

620
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:25.050
Paul Haler testifies at the citizen's hearing on disclosure,

621
00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:30.170
where the fuck am I last month in Washington DC that aliens are living among us

622
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.710
and that it is likely at least two of them are working with the u s government.

623
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:41.530
Oh,
this guy sounds like he's out of his fucking mind.
Ugh.
Let,
let's,

624
00:38:41.531 --> 00:38:45.250
let's,
let's,
let's kind of flip the script here.
Let's say you're an alien.

625
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.280
All right?
Whoever's listening to this still,

626
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:52.630
who believes in aliens who wasn't blogging about my reaction to the blogger?
Um,

627
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.200
<v 2>okay.</v>

628
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.350
<v 7>Can you go to what?
You go to another fucking solar system now,
the galaxy,</v>

629
00:38:57.351 --> 00:39:01.280
whatever the fucking terminology is,
and you land there,

630
00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.373
okay,

631
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.630
what are you going to do other than try and get blended,

632
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.030
blend in so people don't shop your fucking alien head off.

633
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.830
Like how exactly did this fucking alien

634
00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.490
get infiltrate the government.

635
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:26.050
This is like Mr. Smith goes to Washington,
the alien just lands and just goes,

636
00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:29.830
okay.
Ah Right.
I mean,
how come he didn't do this in Argentina?

637
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.260
We picked the United States,
goes right into fucking Washington.

638
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.700
DC walks into the Capitol building as somebody somebodies filibustering so they

639
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:43.990
can't make an electric car or whatever comes right out on the house floor and

640
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:47.760
then does what,
you know,
security comes up,

641
00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:50.190
tries to shoot him and he just puts his hands up in their guns,

642
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:52.680
turned into like chocolate bars or fall to the ground.

643
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:59.060
And then for some reason everybody in their suits doesn't scramble and freak the

644
00:39:59.161 --> 00:40:00.000
fuck out.

645
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

646
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.160
<v 7>You know?
No,</v>

647
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.620
he just fucking walk out there as,
hey,
let's go and I'll relax,
relax,
relax.

648
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:14.000
It's a simple technology that you guys will discover if you become friends with

649
00:40:14.001 --> 00:40:14.600
me.

650
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.650
Hide attorney fucking gone into some melted shit that a doesn't let people shoot

651
00:40:18.651 --> 00:40:22.130
you.
I am from the planet.
Zoll Tar.
Right.

652
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.290
It always begins with z.
How does that work?

653
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

654
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:33.310
<v 7>Like if you were a fucking alien and you went to another God damn planet.</v>

655
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.280
Exactly.
I guess.
Okay.
You'd be like,
all right,

656
00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:40.150
if there's a bunch of different nations,
which one seems to be running?
Shit,

657
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.700
I got to chop the head off and you just gonna Watch you when you were in a
buddy,

658
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.450
two of you
gonna walk in fucking arm and arm

659
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.820
and do what?
Yeah.
Hey,
listen.

660
00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.240
I think just the simple fact that we were able to get here,
you know,

661
00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:03.590
the kind of firepower that we're capable of,
uh,

662
00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.720
for some fucking reason we want to take over this planet or we want you guys to

663
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:12.270
do shit the way we feel that the it should be done.

664
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.670
Who?
Who would want that fucking headache?

665
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.970
I don't,
I don't know that I believe this shit anyways.

666
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:26.920
He believes Hellyer whose beliefs on extra life extra to your life and you are

667
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:28.960
so your foes are well established.

668
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.980
Made the statements at the nongovernmental hearings chaired by six former US

669
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.620
congressmen and aimed at according to the events website,

670
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:41.390
doing what the u s congress had failed to do for 45 years.

671
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.110
Seek out the facts surrounding the most important issue of this or any other

672
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:48.590
time evidence pouring towards an extraterrestrial presence,

673
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:53.060
engaging the human race.
All right.
You know what,

674
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.580
even I have my limits when it comes to that type of shit.
All right.

675
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:00.560
I don't think that's the most pressing thing I would say.
Yeah,

676
00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.250
I was fucking up the environment,
world population and that type of shit.

677
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.113
It's a little more,

678
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:10.470
unless you want to throw more people from other galaxies.
Also living here.

679
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.430
Do they drink bottles?

680
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.670
<v 5>Water too?</v>

681
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.960
<v 7>Um,
all right,
sisters a through c.
Here we go.</v>

682
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.881
Uh,

683
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:09.200
tired of giving advice to guys with psycho suicidal girlfriends or people with

684
00:43:09.201 --> 00:43:12.140
STDs.
Well I got something a bit lighter,
a few here.

685
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.310
A kind of like the cores lite version of your typical advice.
Thank you.

686
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.380
And is perfect for the middle of the summer.

687
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.410
We kicked my feet back on this one so I know this.

688
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:23.420
<v 8>Okay.</v>

689
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.970
<v 7>Who I'd been friends with,
uh,</v>

690
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:30.890
for a while now and banged one time.
She's the oldest of three sisters,

691
00:43:30.891 --> 00:43:35.810
so we all call her sister a.
About two years ago I made out with sister,

692
00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:39.620
be in a club,
not my initiative.
Um,

693
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.310
and ended up having sex with there the same night.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

694
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.260
I went out with her.
Do,

695
00:43:45.261 --> 00:43:48.350
do they have like that thing on the back of their SUV where they had the stick

696
00:43:48.351 --> 00:43:51.890
figures of the entire family and you just slowly keep exiting them out

697
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:58.190
and the family doesn't understand if somebody's trying to kill my daughters.
No,

698
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.080
just trying to fuck all of them,
sir.
Well,
that's a relief.
All right.

699
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.090
Um,
anyways,
I went out with her for a while.
Oh,

700
00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:09.140
this is sister B.

701
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.890
And it was surprisingly not awkward when we were hanging out all together,

702
00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:17.330
even though everyone knew the situation.
Jesus Christ.

703
00:44:17.331 --> 00:44:20.810
What's southern state are you in sir?
Um,

704
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.260
I'll go fuck yourself people down south.
That was funny.
Um,
I'm some months later,

705
00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:26.060
sister be left me for one of her,

706
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.000
one of my friends and got over it quickly enough.

707
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:35.280
But when got over it quickly enough and nowadays I'm still in contact with

708
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:38.730
sister a and B since I'm not the Kinda guy that holds a grudge for that kind of

709
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:41.550
stuff.
Well there you go.
It's very mature,

710
00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:43.590
which means you really didn't give a fuck about either one of them.

711
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.810
So why are you going to be all upset?
You know,

712
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:48.930
like you own their pussy once you fuck it.
I hate when,
I hate when guys do that.

713
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:49.801
Anyways,

714
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:53.910
recently since sisters see started talking to me more frequently after talking

715
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:54.630
for a bit,

716
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:59.630
she said she could pose for me since I'm a painter and she's a model and a 10

717
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.750
all the fucking way I might add,
oh you fucking creep.

718
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.350
You fucking creep.
You fucking creep.

719
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.220
So she was a 10 the whole time.

720
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:15.240
So basically you're in a holding pattern banging her oldest sisters waiting

721
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:18.990
until this girl was of age so he could fucking painter Jesus Christ.
I got to,
I,

722
00:45:18.991 --> 00:45:20.970
you know,
I might have to stand up and applaud this one.

723
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.950
This guy is taking it to another level.

724
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.590
This is a fucking epic situation here.
So you'll see.
Here's my question.

725
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.740
Does that proposition mean anything?
Do you need my advice?

726
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:38.430
I need advice from you.
How do you fuck every girl in the same family?

727
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.180
Jesus Christ.
This is like,

728
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.620
do you know how long there's been an it's been since it's been a triple crown

729
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:48.120
winner in horse racing.

730
00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.750
The last time someone won the Kentucky Derby,

731
00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:53.280
the Preakness and the breeders' Cup.

732
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.960
Is that what it is or is that a soccer match?
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

733
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.793
No fucking horse.

734
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.370
Since the late seventies I would guarantee that it's been since the late

735
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.770
seventies sent somebody has boost bank three.

736
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.420
I think a lot can do two in one family,
but to get all fucking three,

737
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:11.893
two,
three,

738
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.530
two is a respectable three is no,

739
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:19.290
it's beyond respectable.
Two.
Three.
Okay.

740
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.660
Everybody who was three years in the sporting world do that.

741
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:24.480
That's a fucking dynasty.
Okay.

742
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.360
You just put yourself in there with fucking Bill Russell.

743
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:31.620
You put yourself in there with,
with,
with the fucking,
uh,

744
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:38.070
Magic Johnson Lakers,
you know,
I wouldn't say the Colby Lakers.

745
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.120
You know when you go out and you get Phil Jackson and fucking check,
then it,

746
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.860
that's that new shit that the kids like.
I don't like that shit

747
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.870
either way,
dude.
You're talking fucking dynasty.
Oh wait,

748
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.040
magic never won three in a row,

749
00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:52.350
but he had the Celtics to fuck with named went three out of four years.

750
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.410
Give me a fucking break.
Um,
so here's my Michael Jordan.
There we go.

751
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:59.700
So here's my question.
Does that proposition mean anything?
Is it a trap?

752
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.800
Should I try to bang her?

753
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.380
Should I try and bang her too and get a third strike or keep my dick in my pants

754
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:10.860
and avoid a potential shit storm?
And if yes,

755
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.480
do you have any tips,
special tips on this special situation?

756
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.730
All my friends are telling me to do so,

757
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.080
but I thought I'd ask a more refined mine like yourselves before I did a move.

758
00:47:22.081 --> 00:47:25.800
Dude,
you are looking at me like,
dude,
you're beyond me right now.
Okay.

759
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.400
This is like Bull Durham.
I'm,
I'm fucking Kevin Costner.
Um,
I'm,
I'm a lifer.

760
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.500
Okay.
You're,
you're,

761
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:35.630
you're going up to the show hidden brand new balls every fucking day.
I will.

762
00:47:35.631 --> 00:47:40.540
I will you tell me.
Okay.
I never banked two girls in one fucking family.

763
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.890
You know,

764
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:45.430
I was psyched if I was able to tag a couple of friends and we were all hanging

765
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:46.270
out at a bar one night.

766
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:49.510
And you get that feeling like I fuck both of you and you both know it and you

767
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:52.630
both loved it.
I hope.
Please,
please tell me you liked it.

768
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:57.510
Did you like it was I okay?
Um,
dude,

769
00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:02.500
I think you got to do it.
You gotta do it.
You know,
you,

770
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:06.280
you've been above board the whole time.
Sister.
Rain seems to be,

771
00:48:06.281 --> 00:48:08.470
they all fucking knew everything right now.

772
00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:10.420
I understand this is a little delicate.
Okay.

773
00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.770
He's trying to snip the last wire here.
This is the kid sister.
This is,

774
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.590
is it going to blow up in your fucking face?
Uh,
it's worth it,
dude.

775
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:23.710
It's worth it.
It's worth losing a couple of limbs and you nose on this one.

776
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.910
You got to do it
to fuck you know,
dude,

777
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:32.710
what the fuck
she says to you,
I,

778
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.850
yeah,
you're,
you're a painter.

779
00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:36.790
All let me take my clothes off and get paid my fucking Twat.

780
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.840
That's not art today.
That's foreplay.
Give me a fucking break.
If you,
one thing,

781
00:48:40.841 --> 00:48:45.610
if you're in a classroom of people,
it's just you and she's standing there naked

782
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.940
dude.
That's like one of the tabs they have had done that porn cinema,

783
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.650
that scenario in a porn at Jesus Christ,
you might have fun.
A new angle

784
00:48:56.110 --> 00:49:00.460
through.
That's phenomenal.
That is fucking phenomenal,
dude.

785
00:49:00.461 --> 00:49:03.460
You got to do it.
You got to do it.

786
00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:08.020
Did John Elway retire when he only got one?
He came back for another,
right?

787
00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.030
You got to do it to do the w

788
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.090
two that's like when Bush fucking the first Bush.

789
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.160
He stopped and he didn't get sit down.
You got to go all the way on this one,
man.

790
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:23.590
All right.

791
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:29.440
You gotta be like Marlon Brando in fucking apocalypse now.
He just,
you just,

792
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.670
you just accept the fact you left the program.
All right,

793
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:35.223
and

794
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.440
I don't care how mad these girls get,
dude,

795
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:45.450
you are at the precipice of becoming an absolute fucking legend.

796
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.350
Legend.
Who could,
who could,
who's going to be able to top that dude?

797
00:49:52.351 --> 00:49:55.120
There is celebrities who've had orgies,

798
00:49:55.121 --> 00:49:58.480
they've had five on ones and all that type of Shit,
okay?

799
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.990
But I guarantee you they never fucked three fucking girls in the same family

800
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.970
when they weren't famous,
not famous.

801
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:11.200
You're doing this shit with the gift of Gab.
Whatever the fuck you're doing,

802
00:50:11.201 --> 00:50:15.970
do you do this?
You got to write a book.
You gotta write a book that's,
you know,

803
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:16.833
that's easy to do.

804
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:21.070
Collection of the most amazing pussy getting stories ever that you can somehow

805
00:50:21.071 --> 00:50:25.660
confirm,
all right?
And it has to be none of that bullshit.

806
00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:28.370
The second you get famous,
you get money.
That doesn't count,
all right?

807
00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:30.650
That's garbage time,
okay?

808
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:33.810
They put the fucking second team in there and you just fucking Titone layups.

809
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.520
That's bullshit.
I'm talking about just regular dude.
You do.

810
00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.830
You talk yourself into it through the,
and you're a fucking legend.

811
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.370
You got to do it.
All right?
This might halftime speech.

812
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.850
I'm going to quote Joe Barton.

813
00:50:45.851 --> 00:50:50.851
Nick quoting John Madden today is going to be the greatest day of your life,

814
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:58.460
but only if you win.
All right,
you got to do it.

815
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:03.110
<v 9>He got to fucking dude keypad in</v>

816
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.033
the future.

817
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:43.770
<v 10>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

818
00:51:43.771 --> 00:51:47.640
This is bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

819
00:51:47.641 --> 00:51:52.500
September 21st,
2009.
This is like the fifth time I've tried to start this thing.

820
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.720
I don't know where to begin this week.
Uh,

821
00:51:54.721 --> 00:51:57.360
I am psyched because I am in Los Angeles,

822
00:51:57.361 --> 00:52:02.160
at least for today and tomorrow before I fly right back out again.

823
00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:06.230
I'm getting ready to do another special.
So I have to,

824
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.520
I'm in comedy bootcamp right now.

825
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.990
I did a Gig at Boston University this weekend,

826
00:52:12.991 --> 00:52:17.130
the weekend before I was in Philadelphia,
the weekend before I was in Stockholm,

827
00:52:17.131 --> 00:52:20.990
Sweden.
Let me think.
I had a week off and now I got to,

828
00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:25.991
I got a four week intensive right here or I just keep fucking going out and,

829
00:52:26.371 --> 00:52:31.230
uh,
my,
my act is going to get really tight during this time.
But,

830
00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.890
um,
you ever see those fat people on the biggest loser where they're like,

831
00:52:34.891 --> 00:52:37.800
they're losing weight,
but that look of pain when they're on the treadmill?

832
00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:38.970
That's what I have right now.

833
00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.950
If the standup comedy version of that,
you know,

834
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.781
where there's some,

835
00:52:45.781 --> 00:52:50.040
a good looking woman who sort of manly standing over me going,

836
00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:54.060
you've got to tell more jokes.
Do you guys watch a show?
Biggest loser deck?

837
00:52:54.061 --> 00:52:56.400
Did the girl on the woman,
the female,

838
00:52:56.430 --> 00:53:00.660
the broad on that show is like,
I dunno,

839
00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.130
she's really,
really hot.

840
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:07.160
But she's really like manly and I don't mean she looks like a mess.

841
00:53:07.441 --> 00:53:11.370
She just moves.
There's like nothing dainty about her.

842
00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:16.170
And she's some girl you kind of play fight with and then she just unleashed one

843
00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.480
into your ribs and you'd be like,
okay,

844
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.380
you definitely had older brothers because you know how to throw a punch.

845
00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.770
Why are your eyebrows so big?
All right.

846
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:29.640
So if you're new to the podcast and I can't figure out why this fucking thing

847
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:33.690
keeps red line in like that,
turn down the record level here.

848
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:37.830
Maybe that's the problem.
Um,
if you new to this podcast,

849
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:39.630
I do one of these every God damn week.

850
00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.350
I've been doing them for about two years at this point and I pretty much,
uh,

851
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:46.500
I don't think I've really missed a week really.
I mean,

852
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:49.110
occasionally I put them in on Tuesdays,
but generally speaking,

853
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:49.891
I don't miss a week.

854
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:54.450
So they come out every Monday and people send me in questions,

855
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.440
they send me in their list of stuff that they feel is underrated.
Overrated.

856
00:53:58.441 --> 00:54:02.940
We recommend some youtube videos and websites.
We interpret dreams.

857
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.600
No,
actually we don't.
You know what,
that was one that I always want,

858
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:08.920
I've been meaning to do.
Um,

859
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:12.750
people keep asking me for advice and it keeps getting deeper and deeper and

860
00:54:12.751 --> 00:54:16.320
deeper and um,
evidently I haven't,

861
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:19.290
I've been getting some decent reviews with my advice,
but you got to understand,

862
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:22.050
you're talking to guys pretty much fucked up in every area of his life.

863
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:27.340
Like here's one for Ya.
Let me see if I can find this one.
Actually,
the how was,

864
00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:31.720
I was on the plane and I was going through the emails.

865
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.700
I guess I'll have to paraphrase.

866
00:54:36.701 --> 00:54:39.910
This guy basically sent me in one

867
00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:45.490
that was asking advice and he said that he was,

868
00:54:45.491 --> 00:54:49.690
he was married to a Chinese woman

869
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.560
who was like seven years older than him.

870
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:58.330
They had a 10 year old kid and he was from like Vietnam.

871
00:54:58.331 --> 00:55:01.930
I don't fucking remember,
but all I know is they got a kid and he's tired.

872
00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:04.660
He's not attracted to her anymore.

873
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.790
And he wanted some advice and it's just like to,
I,
I,
I don't know.

874
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.000
I mean that sounds about right.
You know,

875
00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:19.060
you've been together for how long now?
Why would I say something like that?
See,

876
00:55:19.061 --> 00:55:20.080
that's why I don't want to,

877
00:55:20.081 --> 00:55:22.330
I don't want to fucking talk about stuff that that's got,
that's,

878
00:55:22.331 --> 00:55:27.080
that's that fucking deep,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

879
00:55:27.081 --> 00:55:28.520
I can see that.
I think that's normal.

880
00:55:28.521 --> 00:55:30.320
Don't they call it like the seven year itch?
You know,

881
00:55:30.321 --> 00:55:32.510
you were in a relationship for like seven years or so,

882
00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:36.200
or maybe 10 years and after awhile it's like,
you know,

883
00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.240
when it comes to the physical thing,

884
00:55:38.241 --> 00:55:42.350
it's like there's no room left in your house where you haven't fucked.

885
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:46.730
There's no position that you haven't done,
you know,

886
00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.090
I mean my girls a pain in the ass.

887
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.530
She was just walking out of the room,
threw her head back.
Are you serious?

888
00:55:57.531 --> 00:56:00.230
Are you seriously going to talk about me this week?
Cause if you are,

889
00:56:00.231 --> 00:56:04.460
I'm going to storm out.
Um,
yeah.
I don't know what to tell you.

890
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.670
Why do you always do that?
Nia,
you just stick your head in you.

891
00:56:09.671 --> 00:56:12.980
You start looking at me like that's gonna make me not be an asshole.

892
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:18.020
I'm always going to be an asshole.
Um,
so anyways,
this is what I,

893
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:21.410
this is what I did.
This is why you can't be here when I do these.
Nia,

894
00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:24.820
you have to leave.
Close the door.
Be a good girl.
Come on,

895
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:30.850
come in here.
All right,
well what?

896
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:36.430
You're distracting me.
Close the door.
Oh,

897
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:39.820
that's a good girl.
You're the worst.
You just keep walking in and out.

898
00:56:39.821 --> 00:56:44.680
It's fucking brutal.
11 1213 seconds wasted.

899
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.480
Oj,
when you girl puts on flip flops,
that's still worse.

900
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.290
When they're being annoying and you keep hearing the sound of that Sandal

901
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:55.000
hitting the fucking healer,
their foot,

902
00:56:55.930 --> 00:57:00.930
and you need to be a little more sensitive and then that silence CTA or you're

903
00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:05.860
walking through some horrific mall that you don't even want to be in.
Oh,

904
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:09.670
look at those sunglasses,
those acute,
I want sunglasses.

905
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:13.360
And you go,
there you go,
guys.
That's how you get rid of your girl.

906
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:17.260
Just start trashing what they're wearing.
And then they store them up,
you know?

907
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:19.750
And then I guarantee you six hours from now she'll be like,

908
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:24.430
do you really not like when I wear flip flops?
I thought you liked them with,

909
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:28.570
oh my God,
why didn't you say something?

910
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:34.320
I just feel so stupid right now.
You know,
we,
she had an argument about health,

911
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.100
you know,
I know I can't stand about fucking women.
I just do this every week.

912
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:43.630
But it's annoying.
It's frustrating.
I can't fucking stand the way they turn.

913
00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.190
Little things.

914
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:50.370
Nothing into these big fucking dramatic falconcrest fucking moments where all of

915
00:57:52.481 --> 00:57:55.930
a sudden like I'm supposed to feel like,
sorry,

916
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:59.200
I can't fucking stand that.
You know,

917
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:03.670
like I was flying back yesterday.
I couldn't,
you know,
from the east coast,

918
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:06.670
I can't find my keys.
All right.

919
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.550
Now for those of you who listen to my podcast all the time,

920
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:14.620
you know that I drive a hybrid like a fig.
I drive a Prius,

921
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.500
right?
It's a great fucking car.
I totally recommend it.

922
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:21.160
Especially if you live in a city.
Why would you buy a sports car in a city?
Huh?

923
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.470
You're going to be stuck in traffic.

924
00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.780
The car's going to get all fucked up cause you can't blow out the lines or

925
00:58:26.781 --> 00:58:30.370
whatever the fuck you supposed to do.
Actually reality is I can't afford the car.

926
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:34.660
I want it.
So I'm just going to trash people who can anyways,
plowing ahead.

927
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:39.810
So how it works with the Fancy Prius is you don't have to stick your key in the

928
00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:41.310
lock.
And you know what?

929
00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:43.840
I don't even have to press a button as long as it's on you.

930
00:58:43.841 --> 00:58:47.770
The second you get in the vicinity of the handle and you touch it,
it unlocks.

931
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:52.360
Okay.
Which you know,
is supposed to be like,
wow,
wow,

932
00:58:52.361 --> 00:58:56.920
we really are going to fucking have flying saucer Sundaes like moment,
you know,

933
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:58.690
so evidently,
but that,

934
00:58:58.691 --> 00:59:03.190
that little mechanism that's supposed to make my life so much easier.

935
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.180
If I lose that thing,
it costs like two or 300 bucks to get a new one.

936
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:08.920
And I can't just be like,

937
00:59:08.921 --> 00:59:11.290
well why don't you just give me one that has a fucking key on it?

938
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:14.530
Cause I don't think that that option exists.
Does it now?
Maybe it does.

939
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:15.453
I don't fucking know.

940
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:18.670
So all I know is I thought I lost like that two or $300 thing.

941
00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.800
I hung around watching the Patriots.

942
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.770
The game went a little bit long cause it was country refs call the fucking

943
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.270
penalty every two seconds.

944
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:30.020
So now I was in jeopardy of missing my flight and I can't find my keys.

945
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:33.950
So I'm rushing around the house.
I tore apart my luggage like twice.
All right.

946
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:38.840
And then I call my girl up and she answers the phone.
I'm like,
I'm like,
Hey,

947
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:42.860
did I leave my keys out in la?
They'll leave my keys out in la.
She goes,
um,

948
00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:47.600
yeah,
yeah,
you left him in the car.
I said,
okay,
cool.
All right.
I'll,
ah,

949
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.120
no,
no,
no.
She answered it right.
Why?
I said,
she goes,
yeah,

950
00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:52.340
you left them in the car.
And I said,
okay.
Okay.
All right,
cool.

951
00:59:52.341 --> 00:59:55.930
I'll call you from the airport.
And she just goes,
okay,

952
00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:01.700
that's yeah,
that you talk to me for a minute.
You know,

953
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.180
they create that fucking moment.
You know what I mean?

954
01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:07.810
This is why women are not in battle in war.
Right fucking there.

955
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.550
He'd start giving quit fucking,
you know,

956
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:18.500
orders fakey asking me how my day and the Fox Hall went first before he just

957
01:00:19.051 --> 01:00:23.520
started telling me the charge up the hill.
No,
that's okay.
You know,

958
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:29.280
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't tolerate that.
So when they say shit like that,

959
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:34.940
well I guess,
I guess you,
they're too busy to talk to me.
That's right.

960
01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:39.440
I am.
All right.
See you later.
Okay.
You know,

961
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:44.300
and then you just fucking go.
Four three,
two,
one.
And then the phone calls again.

962
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.730
What's the problem?
Is there a problem?

963
01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:52.820
And then you're in it.
You're in the fucking fight that they wanted to.
Yeah.

964
01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:57.610
You just can't fucking actually,
you can win.
You can win.

965
01:00:57.611 --> 01:01:00.880
You just going to live a lonely life,
but you can win.
And speaking of that,

966
01:01:00.881 --> 01:01:02.140
this is something I've learned the other,
you know,

967
01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:06.320
I use the word control a lot here on my podcast and uh,

968
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.380
I don't know how they hell I came across this,

969
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.860
but I would like to read to you guys about a street that existed in the Middle

970
01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.660
Ages by the name of grope cut lane.

971
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:23.230
I'm not bullshitting you grope cunt lane,

972
01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:27.340
pronounced grope cunt lane or they come late.
They have to have that.

973
01:01:27.341 --> 01:01:28.660
Like I can't read English.
Okay.

974
01:01:28.661 --> 01:01:33.220
Was his street name found in English towns and cities during the middle ages

975
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:37.900
believe to be a reference to the prostitution centered on those?

976
01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.700
Uh,
in those areas it was normal practice for medieval names,

977
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:47.940
street names to reflect the streets function or economic activity taking place

978
01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:50.170
within it.
Grope.
Cont

979
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.860
the earliest known use of,

980
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:58.861
which is about 1230 after the death of that dude that everyone thought was holy,

981
01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:05.970
appears to have been derived as a compound of the words grope and can't,

982
01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.210
don't you hate when people explain obvious shit?
Like really?
Yeah.

983
01:02:10.211 --> 01:02:12.190
I couldn't put the two of those grope cunt.

984
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:15.640
What are the Wa everyone knows what groping is,

985
01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:22.110
you know,
there's
no other word for what,
what else can grope mean

986
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:27.120
and can't is,
yeah,
yeah.
GRUB contact.
Got It.

987
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.010
Why don't we have puberty lately on this?
I got it,
Ma.

988
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:36.600
I really like this girl in class.
What do I say?
Um,

989
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:38.760
streets with that name.

990
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:42.080
We're often in the busiest parts of medieval towns and cities.
Yeah,

991
01:02:42.081 --> 01:02:45.600
it's a red light district and at least one appears to have been an important

992
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:47.910
thoroughfare.
Um,
although,

993
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:50.820
although the name was once commonly common throughout England,

994
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.480
changes in attitude results resulted in,

995
01:02:54.481 --> 01:02:59.481
it's being replaced by more innocuous versions such as grape lane

996
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.550
grope was last recorded as a street name in 1561.

997
01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.720
You know what I mean?
So all you guys out there,

998
01:03:09.721 --> 01:03:14.250
you still have cool names for your stadiums and now you have a,

999
01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:19.260
I need a job.com arena as opposed to like war memorial coliseum.

1000
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.520
It's been going on forever.
All right.

1001
01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:27.540
And you know when they changed it to grape lane that there was people who still

1002
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:31.710
called it grope cunt.
And then there was people like it's it's group alone.

1003
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:36.540
Okay,
have a little bit with clues.
Um,
go fuck yourself.

1004
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:39.540
What are people doing down there on grape lane?

1005
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:47.330
You know what that is just the beginning of like dead clean comedy and why you

1006
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:51.150
know something you need.
You need grape lane for grope con to be funny.

1007
01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:55.390
You need grape lane.
I'm full of Shit.
It's just fucking annoying me.
Like does,

1008
01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.920
does that mean because you call it grape lane,

1009
01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:04.140
does that mean that there's any less fucking women down there getting,
you know,

1010
01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:07.290
getting their consc groped?
You know,

1011
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:13.120
do you guys know what I got?
I got an email from somebody.
Uh,
I dunno,

1012
01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.350
a priest,
a pastor.
Uh,
I dunno what the fuck it was.

1013
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.620
Some person who a holy person and said that they saw me on TV and that they

1014
01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:24.870
thought I was absolutely hilarious,

1015
01:04:24.871 --> 01:04:29.820
but they wished that I hadn't cursed as much because it was getting beeped out a

1016
01:04:29.821 --> 01:04:30.121
lot.

1017
01:04:30.121 --> 01:04:35.121
And then they stumbled across my podcast and thought the podcast was also

1018
01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.031
hilarious,

1019
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:40.650
but just could not get past the fact of how much I curse.

1020
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:46.830
And,
um,
I don't understand people.
I can see if you have a child there,

1021
01:04:46.831 --> 01:04:51.810
but I just don't understand like adults who just like,
uh,
you know,

1022
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.000
it's like,
dude,
you're on the Internet.
Okay.
What?

1023
01:04:56.010 --> 01:05:00.930
There's nothing I'm saying that's going to be shocking.
Good Lord.
I Dunno.

1024
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:05.700
You know,
is he right?
I don't fucking know.

1025
01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:06.960
You know what?
I don't have class.

1026
01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.520
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1027
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.970
<v 10>You know what they don't like about having class?
There's this,
there's,
there's,</v>

1028
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:17.060
there's a lack of honesty to it.
You know what I mean?
The,

1029
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:21.040
you put on a pair of a pair of loafers and a blazer,
okay.

1030
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.540
And all of a sudden Peabo look at him.
He's a gentleman,
he's,
he's quiet.

1031
01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:27.640
And then all of a sudden you start calling grope con grape lane and that that's

1032
01:05:27.641 --> 01:05:30.480
how it begins.
You know,

1033
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.240
you start calling it human resources.

1034
01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:40.270
That creepy shit.
I don't fucking know.
You know,

1035
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:46.330
I like to say fuck,
I do.
I like it.
It feels good.

1036
01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:51.070
You know,
nothing.
I,
you know,
something people out there who are clean,

1037
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.170
who don't curse as much.
Can you,
can you give me a word,
um,

1038
01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.350
that did,
that,
you know,
when you're angry,

1039
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:04.351
like what word gets it out like that you can stress and the just ends with that.

1040
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:07.811
You know,
you just,

1041
01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:12.811
you just stick the landing like fucking Mary Lou Retton anyways,

1042
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:14.223
so whatever.

1043
01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:18.430
My point is that there used to be a street called grope current lane,
you know,

1044
01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:21.760
back in a more honest time when they could be hedge you every five fucking

1045
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:23.260
seconds.
Um,
you know,

1046
01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:25.660
it's one of those deals where you look back on a time and there's certain things

1047
01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:28.360
about it that you liked in other aspects you didn't,
I mean,

1048
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:32.200
I liked the fact that the,
where the horse,
we're was called Grope cunt lane.

1049
01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:37.010
You know,
I mean,
shit,
you don't even need a map.
You don't need that.

1050
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:38.500
You know why they had that back then?

1051
01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:41.910
They didn't have those little tourist brochures to let you know that,
uh,

1052
01:06:41.911 --> 01:06:45.640
where are you?
What part of the city you are in?
Oh,

1053
01:06:45.641 --> 01:06:47.580
it's right there on the corner of a

1054
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.230
fucking raped me and grope cunt.
Oh yeah,
that's the red light district.
Okay,

1055
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.920
I got it.
Cool.
You know,
and then the other side was,
uh,

1056
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:02.590
you know,
black,
black Smith row and cobbler fucking lane.
I don't,
I dunno,

1057
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:05.620
you know what?
I'm too stupid to Improv with this right here.

1058
01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:08.680
But you know what I'm saying?
Actually,
Bill,
you know what?

1059
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:12.130
We've known what you've been saying for the last 15 fucking minutes.

1060
01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.010
Why don't you get on with the podcast?
All right?

1061
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:18.250
It's already 1226 out here and I have something to do at one,

1062
01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:23.230
so I got to fucking get moving along here.
Um,
oh,

1063
01:07:23.231 --> 01:07:26.560
and what I have to start doing is hyping my shit more towards the front because

1064
01:07:26.561 --> 01:07:30.100
I think a lot of people get sick of me by the end of it.
God knows I do.
So,
uh,

1065
01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:32.740
this week I'm going to be at the Improv in Addison,
Texas,

1066
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.940
Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday and Sunday and I'm going to the cowboys game,

1067
01:07:36.941 --> 01:07:41.500
the Monday night game against the Carolina Panthers on uh,

1068
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:42.334
on the Monday.

1069
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:47.910
So if you see me stumbling through the parking lot because I will be drinking.

1070
01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:52.690
All right,
please offer me a burger or something like that because a,

1071
01:07:52.691 --> 01:07:53.521
I don't know if I'm going to have,

1072
01:07:53.521 --> 01:07:58.210
the person I'm going with is going to have a fucking grill,
you know.
Um,
anyway,

1073
01:07:58.211 --> 01:08:01.480
so let's plow ahead here.
Uh,
and after next week,

1074
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:05.170
the week after I'm going to be at the stress factory in New Jersey and the week

1075
01:08:05.171 --> 01:08:08.410
after that I'm going to be in Pittsburgh at the Improv.
Then I have a week off.

1076
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:12.120
Then I'm at the Improv in DC,

1077
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.360
so there's no excuse to see me on the fucking east coast already cause I just

1078
01:08:17.361 --> 01:08:21.980
got back from Boston.
I was in New York in May.
I've been everywhere.

1079
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:25.580
I write.
All right,
Bill.
Exactly.
I know,
I'm sorry.

1080
01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:29.720
I just been like a real jerk lately.
I've been really like this how I get when I,

1081
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:33.290
I'm,
I'm under the gun.
I really shouldn't do like podcasts.

1082
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:37.850
I was under the gun last week.
Um,
I dunno,
let's,

1083
01:08:37.851 --> 01:08:40.400
let's just plow ahead here.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

1084
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.040
Now people have been asking me a lot of advice.
Um,

1085
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.580
my girlfriend had this real weird dream the other day and I actually interpreted

1086
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.310
it to the point where she went,
wow,
that was pretty good.
And I was like,

1087
01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:51.260
you know what?
That'd be great.
Should I podcast listeners?

1088
01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:53.240
If you have some sort of,
you have ever one of those dreams,

1089
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:57.530
you just have no idea what a fucking meant and maybe you need somebody insight

1090
01:08:57.531 --> 01:09:00.440
into it.
Like,
here's one for you.
I had a dream the other day.

1091
01:09:00.441 --> 01:09:02.240
I was flying on an airplane.

1092
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:03.650
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1093
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:08.180
<v 10>And for some reason I was faced in the opposite direction.
Like I was on a train.</v>

1094
01:09:08.181 --> 01:09:08.391
You know,

1095
01:09:08.391 --> 01:09:11.870
those little areas where you can have like people face each other and they can

1096
01:09:11.871 --> 01:09:16.100
discuss the latest styles.
Like it's the fucking 18 hundreds.
Um,

1097
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.320
yeah,
I was sitting like that.
Right.

1098
01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:21.470
I was sitting the other way and I was looking through plexiglass and I was

1099
01:09:21.471 --> 01:09:24.320
watching George Carlin doing standup.

1100
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:29.590
And for some reason he was missing his right hand.

1101
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.570
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1102
01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:34.450
<v 10>And I was like,
Holy Shit,
this George Carlin,
I couldn't believe it.</v>

1103
01:09:34.451 --> 01:09:36.700
And he's right fucking there.
And what happened to his hand?

1104
01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:42.010
And then when we went to get off the plane,
all of a sudden he was really,
really

1105
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:43.010
<v 11>okay.</v>

1106
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:47.720
<v 10>Skinny in small and almost looked like an like a woman.</v>

1107
01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.200
And then I walked around the front,
he had like a beard and he,

1108
01:09:52.201 --> 01:09:55.320
and he was missing his fucking hand.
And I,
and I,
what the hell did I say to him?

1109
01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:57.330
I said,
I didn't wanna let you know.
You got to think you're really funny,

1110
01:09:57.331 --> 01:10:00.900
whatever.
And then now with the eye camera,
what the fuck?
He said to me,

1111
01:10:00.901 --> 01:10:03.390
he said something weird back to me and then walked away.

1112
01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:04.480
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1113
01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.740
<v 10>And then I got back on the plane like it was a subway and it just continued on</v>

1114
01:10:08.741 --> 01:10:10.870
flying somewhere,
you know?

1115
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.650
And that's one of those dreams you just say to somebody in,

1116
01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:16.930
they're looking at you like,
uh,
uh,
I dunno dude.

1117
01:10:16.931 --> 01:10:18.610
Maybe you want to fucking,

1118
01:10:18.611 --> 01:10:21.400
maybe you're fucking attracted to George Carlin and some fucked up.

1119
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.390
I don't fucking know.
It was just a weird ass fucking dream.

1120
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.270
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1121
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:33.530
<v 10>Why is he missing a hand?
Why did he look like a woman?
You know,</v>

1122
01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:38.030
what's the deal with fucked up dreams if you have fucked up dream like that one.

1123
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:39.770
Cause I can't make heads or tails of that one.

1124
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:44.900
Why was I faced in the opposite direction?
Well,
build in life.

1125
01:10:44.901 --> 01:10:46.070
You feel as though,

1126
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:49.790
you know everybody's just going in this one direction and you don't agree with

1127
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:52.250
the direction you're going in the other direction.

1128
01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:53.550
<v 11>Okay?</v>

1129
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:57.600
<v 10>That's what you feel and you want to get to where some of your heroes are.</v>

1130
01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:00.920
But there's this invisible piece of plexi glass.

1131
01:11:00.921 --> 01:11:03.000
It seems to stop you from going there.

1132
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:04.420
<v 11>Okay?</v>

1133
01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.980
<v 10>And a lot of times when you don't do what everybody else wants you to do,</v>

1134
01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:10.520
they say you're evil.

1135
01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:11.560
<v 11>Okay?</v>

1136
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.760
<v 10>And back in the day when people to write with their left hands,</v>

1137
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:18.660
they thought those kids were demonic and they used to slap their left hand and

1138
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:20.370
make them write with their right hand.

1139
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:24.540
So maybe because you're a hero was on the other side of that glass.

1140
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.630
He was evil and that's why he didn't have a right hand.

1141
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:36.220
See,
I can do it.
I could somehow find a fucking through line,

1142
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:37.743
you know?

1143
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.420
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1144
01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.680
<v 10>And then maybe you,</v>

1145
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:44.890
you always wanting to hook up with Gloria on a fucking all in the family.

1146
01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.520
And that's why when you were walking behind George Carlin,

1147
01:11:49.521 --> 01:11:53.530
that's what he looked like.
An old Gloria.
All right,
let's fucking,
let's end this.

1148
01:11:53.531 --> 01:11:57.380
All right,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,
we actually,

1149
01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:59.420
for the first time on my podcast,

1150
01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.530
I have a follow up email from somebody that I gave advice to,

1151
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.850
to see how shit worked out.
Um,

1152
01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.250
and of course I can't fucking find it.

1153
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:11.900
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1154
01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.590
<v 10>Why,
why do I do this to myself?
All right.
As I search for it.
I'll tell you,</v>

1155
01:12:15.591 --> 01:12:18.530
remember last week when I was telling you about the guy who had his,
uh,

1156
01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.050
his brother a cock blocked him.

1157
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.633
<v 12>MMM.</v>

1158
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:29.870
<v 10>You know,
at the party,
he,
you know,
he meets the beautiful girl first.</v>

1159
01:12:29.871 --> 01:12:32.570
She asked for a piece of cake.
He said,
I'll go get you one.
He leaves,

1160
01:12:32.571 --> 01:12:35.840
he comes back and then his fucking douchebag,
older brother,

1161
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:40.060
he's trying to get her number.
Well,
he wrote me back.
He said,
uh,

1162
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:43.250
well here's what ended up happening.
Um,

1163
01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:46.340
no,
that's it.
I don't know.
Okay.

1164
01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.790
The next day after meeting that 26 year old and having my brother's steal her

1165
01:12:49.791 --> 01:12:54.290
numbers,
she ended up requesting me on Facebook.
Got To love the Internet.

1166
01:12:54.291 --> 01:12:57.860
He says,
uh,
she then wrote me saying,
nice to meet you.
Thanks for the cake.

1167
01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.100
I wrote back and we made some conversation,
uh,

1168
01:13:01.101 --> 01:13:04.490
where I ended with hope to see you around again.
She agreed and said the same,

1169
01:13:04.491 --> 01:13:08.150
so fuck it.
I asked for a phone number.
Needless to say,
she gave it to me.

1170
01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:09.710
We played the phone game for a week.

1171
01:13:09.711 --> 01:13:12.920
We made plans to go out to some club on Saturday.
By the way,

1172
01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:17.200
I'm not much of a dancer,
but if necessary,
I can bullshit my way through it.
Uh,

1173
01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:18.710
my luck could not have been any better.

1174
01:13:18.711 --> 01:13:22.940
We got there around 3:00 AM and the French she came with,

1175
01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:25.190
ended up leaving thinking I was taking her home.

1176
01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.170
Whether they planned that or not,
I dunno,

1177
01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.550
but we got to her house and she a little tipsy,
tells me to come up.
Doesn't ask,

1178
01:13:31.551 --> 01:13:34.340
would you like to come in?
She casually tells me to come in,

1179
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:38.930
duck getting too crude.
I'm proud to say I fucked the shit out of her.

1180
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:45.110
Funny thing.
While I was bagging her,
I remember thinking to myself,

1181
01:13:45.111 --> 01:13:49.010
wait till I tell bill,
dude,

1182
01:13:49.011 --> 01:13:51.590
I really hope this story is true.
All right,

1183
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:56.180
cause I want the best for all my 14 podcast listeners.
I hope this happened.

1184
01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.250
Um,
ha.
Um,
anyways,

1185
01:13:58.251 --> 01:14:03.080
he said I had to turn my head down and stop myself from laughing.
Now,

1186
01:14:03.081 --> 01:14:03.561
my brother,

1187
01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:07.490
the cop now for those of you who didn't listen last week or two weeks ago,

1188
01:14:07.491 --> 01:14:11.000
whenever the hell I read it,
uh,
her brother's a cop.
All right.

1189
01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.260
And he's also a cock block and Douche bag.
Evidently.
Um,

1190
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.020
the cop works the night shifts.
Dude,

1191
01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:20.080
he's not at copies of fucking security guard.
Stop at her.

1192
01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:23.620
I was wondering how the hell he became a police officer at 21 probably works at

1193
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:27.300
a video store.
The fucking creep.
Anyways,
he said,
we ended up,
uh,

1194
01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.900
getting home at the same time,

1195
01:14:28.901 --> 01:14:33.310
around 6:00 AM him in his late ships,
late shifts,

1196
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:35.080
security guard brother.
He said,
uh,

1197
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.450
I'm not wanting to rub shit in my brother's face,

1198
01:14:37.451 --> 01:14:39.550
but he asked me what I ended up doing for the night.

1199
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.430
So I simply told him I chilled with that Monica Bitch,

1200
01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.060
his face said it all with me getting home.

1201
01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:48.430
At that time he was able to put two and two together.

1202
01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:51.100
I'm not sure whether this counts as a revenge story or not.

1203
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:54.250
Since I didn't take a bat to his squad car or anything,

1204
01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:58.480
but with the way shit turned out,
I don't think a revenge is necessary.

1205
01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:02.500
Also on a different note,
I,
um,
all right.
So we ended up getting it.

1206
01:15:02.501 --> 01:15:07.270
Then the rest is about how he has four dogs and unfortunately he had to put one

1207
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:10.540
down and he told me [inaudible] she gave me good advice.
He goes,

1208
01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.690
you can't believe how much you miss your dog when it's finally gone.

1209
01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:17.170
So make sure you enjoy your dog.
Which I did in which I am.

1210
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.630
I wrestled my fucking dog.
The dog likes to wrestle.
Isn't that right?
Clear.
Huh?

1211
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:28.330
Good dog.
You a good dog,
Huh?
Fucking maniac.

1212
01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:33.040
You wake me up every morning.
Um,
anyways.
All right,
let's get onto,
um,

1213
01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.080
how bout some youtube videos for the weekend?
Everybody,
let me scroll down here.

1214
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:42.190
I actually have a website that I think is kind of blowing up on the Internet

1215
01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:46.960
right now and I wasn't able to,
uh,
to get to it.
I think it got too many hits.

1216
01:15:46.961 --> 01:15:51.310
These kids started it.
It's the name of the website is people of Walmart.

1217
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.310
Just search for that.
And I guess these people go,

1218
01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:58.000
they just walk around and taking pictures of all the fucking freaks you see in a

1219
01:15:58.001 --> 01:16:00.970
Walmart and they just thought it was going to be something that would be funny

1220
01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:04.540
amongst them and their friends and somehow and ended up on funny or die.

1221
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:08.980
So evidently it's hilarious.
Uh,
check that out.

1222
01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:14.020
And for sports fans,
because we seem to have a lot of them on this,

1223
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:18.760
um,
and even if you're,
you're overseas,
you,
you can,

1224
01:16:18.761 --> 01:16:23.761
you can actually enjoy this one search bears fan catch it catches kick on

1225
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:30.130
youtube bears fan catches kick and it was basically from a Monday night football

1226
01:16:30.131 --> 01:16:34.600
game about a,
I dunno,
2024 years ago,

1227
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:35.920
25 years in 1985,

1228
01:16:35.921 --> 01:16:39.730
24 years ago the bears kick in an extra point.

1229
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:44.290
It's going through the uprights and into the stands and all of a sudden coming

1230
01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:48.490
from like the right hand side of the TV screen,
this guy just jumps,

1231
01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.520
you know,
like a stadium.
Like when you kick an extra point,

1232
01:16:51.521 --> 01:16:55.300
it usually goes down and into the alleyway where the,
uh,
the players run into.

1233
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.600
That's basically what it was.
This guy's like fucking,
you know,

1234
01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:00.460
a good 20 feet in the air.
He,

1235
01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.640
and the best part of it is he's just completely standing up.

1236
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.360
I think I've actually talked about this before in the podcast and he catches the

1237
01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:12.361
ball with no fucking concern whatsoever about his own God damn safety.

1238
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:16.760
I Dunno who he landed on our what,
but if he did that today in America,

1239
01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:21.761
there'd be some sort of al Qaeda nine 11 fucking group of people that would go

1240
01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:25.300
after this guy with his mullet,
new z cavalry cheese.

1241
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.720
Like he isn't just some drunk coked up football fan that can jump to stories

1242
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:31.310
without breaking his fucking ankle.

1243
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.250
They treat him like he was some sort of terrorist and put his face into the

1244
01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:38.270
fucking ground.
But this is back in the day.
All right,

1245
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:41.870
pre all that bullshit.
They actually showed the replay.

1246
01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.500
We're talking about what a great catch it was in Lynn Swann.

1247
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.840
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1248
01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.050
<v 10>The hall of fame fucking wide receiver.
Where I'd one of the best world,</v>

1249
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:53.920
a world series,
best Superbowls ever.
Actually interviews the guy.

1250
01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:59.800
So check that one out.
Check that one out.
Why don't you,
um,
all right,
that's it.

1251
01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:01.870
Now let,
let me get onto the advice.
Like I said,

1252
01:18:01.871 --> 01:18:05.680
I got to blow through it this week.
I apologize.
Um,
hey bill.

1253
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.210
So I was going out with this girl.

1254
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:11.170
She was real cute and real funny and we had a lot in common.
I'll do,

1255
01:18:11.171 --> 01:18:14.110
this is a bro,
this is a fucking weird story here he goes.
Uh,

1256
01:18:14.111 --> 01:18:17.050
we had gone out four or five times,
so I thought I was getting,
you know,

1257
01:18:17.051 --> 01:18:21.040
semi serious.
Then one day she called me and told me we had to cancel,

1258
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:25.570
cancel a dinner.
We had planned for later that week.
She had a legitimate reason.

1259
01:18:25.571 --> 01:18:30.070
So I was like,
just like,
I fuck it.
Well,
just reschedule.
No biggie.
Right?

1260
01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:34.270
So later in the week I call her and get her voicemail and leave her a message

1261
01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:38.320
asking if she had,
uh,
she was free a certain day to have dinner.

1262
01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.840
She never gets back to me.
So I wait a few more days and I call her again.

1263
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:46.780
I ended up leaving another message.
Fucking nothing.

1264
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:49.360
Never calls me back at this point.

1265
01:18:49.361 --> 01:18:52.450
I wait about a week and call again and leave one more message.

1266
01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:54.010
Not a goddamn thing.

1267
01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.480
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1268
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.870
<v 10>What the fuck?
Who does that?
Sorry,
I got lost there.
What the fuck?</v>

1269
01:18:59.871 --> 01:19:04.460
Who does that fucking at least call me?
Tell me it's over.
Tell me.

1270
01:19:04.461 --> 01:19:08.420
I'm lame.
Say you have to wash your hair or your dog ate your love life,

1271
01:19:08.421 --> 01:19:09.590
but fucking call.

1272
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:13.220
I talked to my parents and friends and they have all consoled me and gave me

1273
01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:17.780
advice or whatever.
But I needed advice from,

1274
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:22.790
I want you to get some advice from you.
Um,
all right,
well,

1275
01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:27.110
let's be honest.
She took the easy way out.
Um,

1276
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:32.450
you know,
she obviously didn't want to see you in anymore obviously,
and yeah,
she,

1277
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.960
she took the fucking easy way out and um,

1278
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:38.750
who's getting her breaking up with somebody is one of the hardest things.

1279
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:40.580
The fear of it.

1280
01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.440
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1281
01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:42.711
<v 10>You know,</v>

1282
01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:46.070
I saw this thing on intervention one time where they were talking about drug

1283
01:19:46.071 --> 01:19:49.500
addicts and they say basically they,

1284
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:53.900
they'll spend 20 years avoiding,
you know,

1285
01:19:53.901 --> 01:19:58.901
10 days of pain by continuing to medicate themselves because in their head,

1286
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:01.580
the pain of going through,

1287
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:07.180
getting clean is so fucking huge that they,
that they'll contain,

1288
01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:10.620
they'll,
they'll go through 20 years of fucking hell.
You know,

1289
01:20:10.621 --> 01:20:14.310
and that's what relationships can be like where people get into relationships

1290
01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:15.930
and they want to break up with someone.

1291
01:20:15.931 --> 01:20:19.830
They just don't know how to fucking do it.
And they're just thinking,
oh my God,

1292
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:22.140
I'm going to break this verse.
It's hard.
They're going to cry.

1293
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:25.860
I want to feel horrible.
Uh,
you know,
for guys,

1294
01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:29.370
what if they start screaming and throwing shit and charging me,
you know,

1295
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.240
with the salt,
because when they threw a bookcase at me,

1296
01:20:33.241 --> 01:20:38.040
it bounced off my big forehead and then hit their big toe,
you know?
Um,

1297
01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:43.770
so
I know this is going to sound fucked up,
but his is,

1298
01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.880
she kind of,
she did you a favor in a weird,

1299
01:20:48.881 --> 01:20:52.600
she obviously felt that there wasn't a,

1300
01:20:52.601 --> 01:20:56.350
the connection to make it long lasting.
Um,

1301
01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:59.950
and I know she took the coward way out,
but at least she,
she,

1302
01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:04.660
she figured out a way to get out of it before she fucking rips your heart out of

1303
01:21:04.661 --> 01:21:07.960
your chest.
I mean,
I know a probably sucked,
but it didn't seem like,
you know,

1304
01:21:07.961 --> 01:21:11.290
you have been gone.
You said you're going to have four or five times.

1305
01:21:11.291 --> 01:21:13.360
So I thought it was getting you all right.
See you went,
I like,
you know,

1306
01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:14.650
four or five times too.

1307
01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:19.180
I mean that's some shit you can get over that at a keg party.
You know,

1308
01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:25.010
a couple of fucking plastic 16 ouncers and you grabbed the fucking closest

1309
01:21:26.621 --> 01:21:30.280
Hooters looking chick,
you know,
or whatever.
Talk a little bit of Shit.

1310
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:37.350
You know,
she did you a favor man.
So,
I don't know how old you are,

1311
01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:40.410
but this girl sounds like you guys sound like you're young and when you're young

1312
01:21:40.411 --> 01:21:42.710
you really don't know how to do it.
Um,

1313
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.020
the best way I found to do it,
I mean,
we asked,

1314
01:21:46.021 --> 01:21:48.960
you should have like a fucking class on that,
how to break up with somebody.

1315
01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:50.701
First of all,
you get,

1316
01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:54.390
you got to psych yourself up mentally to do it and you just have to be like,

1317
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.253
all right,

1318
01:21:56.010 --> 01:22:01.010
we're going to talk at two and my life is going to suck from about two to

1319
01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:05.220
possibly four 30 or five.

1320
01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:12.110
And I just have to understand that the next three hours of my life is going to

1321
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:17.100
suck.
You know?
It's Kinda like if he had to fight a kid after school,
you're like,

1322
01:22:17.101 --> 01:22:18.540
okay,
we're fighting around three.

1323
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:21.560
By the time I remember a buddy of mine used to always get into fights for,

1324
01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:26.040
because I used to be like,
dude,
how the fuck do you fight?
Like Dan?
He goes,

1325
01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:29.550
so I just think in an hour I'm going to be home.
I'm going to be in my bed.

1326
01:22:29.551 --> 01:22:33.180
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's kind of the same way I look at like,
you know,

1327
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:35.090
<v 12>yeah.</v>

1328
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:38.490
<v 10>If back in the day when I do a college gig and they just had me standing in a</v>

1329
01:22:38.491 --> 01:22:41.700
fucking hallway with no microphone and I'm like,
all right,

1330
01:22:41.701 --> 01:22:44.850
this is going to be absolutely humiliating.
But in an hour from now,

1331
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.030
I'll have my check and I'll be in my fucking,
you know,

1332
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:52.550
Buick Skylark rented from Ava,
so whatever.

1333
01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.640
And I'll be fucking drab driving away from here and I'll just be a funny story.

1334
01:22:55.641 --> 01:22:58.400
Who gives a shit?
So that's kind of what you have to do

1335
01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:02.930
and a,
and you can't leave any,
there's no daylight.

1336
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:07.510
And a great way to stop to start is just to say that you're not happy,

1337
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:14.140
you know,
I'm not happy what age you,
I'm just,
I'm not happy.

1338
01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:19.180
You know,
you're a great person.
You can,
you know,
all of that type of stuff.

1339
01:23:19.181 --> 01:23:20.950
I feel horrible,
but

1340
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:22.140
<v 12>okay.</v>

1341
01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:26.590
<v 10>You know,
it's not working for me and I have to figure out why.
And I just,</v>

1342
01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:30.540
this just doesn't feel right in my,
you go and you just get that out.

1343
01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:33.000
And once you get that out,

1344
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:37.620
then the fucking tears and all the bullshit comes and then you just,
you fucking,

1345
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:42.810
you just got to stand there and take it,
you know?

1346
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:47.600
And it's just getting through that first major fucking day of it.

1347
01:23:47.601 --> 01:23:51.050
And then you got to have other conversations.
Fucking brutal.
It's fucking brutal.

1348
01:23:51.051 --> 01:23:52.790
So getting back to this look,

1349
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.830
<v 12>okay.</v>

1350
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:54.663
<v 10>You know,</v>

1351
01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:58.060
you guys sound like you're young and I just don't think that she has the mental

1352
01:23:58.061 --> 01:24:00.910
ability to be like,
yeah,
listen,
you know,
we've gone out like four or five times.

1353
01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:02.170
I think you're really nice guy,

1354
01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:05.380
but I just don't feel like it's going to go anywhere else above.

1355
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.410
And who's kidding?
Who,
if she did that,
you'd still be just as fucking pissed.

1356
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:12.460
But it is weird when they just disappear off the face of the earth like that.

1357
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:15.910
I've,
I've had that man,
I had the classic,
uh,
she's in the shower,

1358
01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:17.330
<v 12>okay.</v>

1359
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:20.210
<v 10>In a roommate sucked at lying and once she's in the shower,</v>

1360
01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.530
callback and a half an hour and I called back in a half an hour,
um,

1361
01:24:24.531 --> 01:24:26.780
she's repairing her credenza,

1362
01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:31.910
callback and 17 minutes and I called back in 17 minutes.
Dude,
I called,

1363
01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.540
I want a fucking moron,
I must have called like eight times.

1364
01:24:35.541 --> 01:24:37.520
And then they finally stopped answering the phone.

1365
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.890
You know you ever have that,

1366
01:24:40.891 --> 01:24:44.580
like you're avoiding somebody call and in like your thinking there finally not

1367
01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:45.330
going to call.

1368
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:48.300
And then the phone rings and you literally get that little fucking heart attack

1369
01:24:48.301 --> 01:24:53.040
and your chest.
You almost scared of the God damn phone.
Um,

1370
01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:55.080
what I would do,

1371
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:58.140
she did not a break up with you and she did and she did you a favor.

1372
01:24:58.141 --> 01:25:00.960
Do cause she could have stuck with you for another six months and you could have

1373
01:25:00.961 --> 01:25:03.660
been walking around telling all your friends how much you love her and how great

1374
01:25:03.661 --> 01:25:08.220
she is.
And then she dumps you out of fucking nowhere of banks,

1375
01:25:08.221 --> 01:25:10.350
one of your friends.
And then you got to carry,

1376
01:25:10.351 --> 01:25:12.920
you could carry that shit around for eight years.
And you know what you do get.

1377
01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:16.830
It ended up being start going out hurting other girls who had nothing to fucking

1378
01:25:16.831 --> 01:25:20.670
do with that.
So in a weird way,
consider yourself lucky you're out of it.

1379
01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:21.983
You know,

1380
01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:25.200
why would you want to waste any more time with someone who's not NTA anyways?

1381
01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:28.530
And you're absolutely right.
It was fucked up.
She should have called you,

1382
01:25:28.531 --> 01:25:32.290
but she's just not at that level of maturity and a,
you got a life delete.

1383
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:35.190
So there's no reason to carry around anymore.
You understand me?

1384
01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:37.590
So you go out there,
you have a couple of drinks.

1385
01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:39.560
She talked some shit to some broads this weekend.

1386
01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.840
He put her fucking behind you and it's football season.
You know,

1387
01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.890
we'll fire up the fucking grill and forget about it.
All right,
here we go.

1388
01:25:46.891 --> 01:25:48.390
Moving on.
Next one.
Bill,

1389
01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:51.840
I watched a couple of your shows and videos that you stand up.

1390
01:25:51.841 --> 01:25:56.320
I really enjoy your work.
Thank you.
Uh,
but,
but uh,

1391
01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:02.640
all right.
Um,
um,
I've been listening to podcasts.
All right,

1392
01:26:02.641 --> 01:26:06.560
here we go am a sophomore and I'm attending a public school that has a

1393
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:09.200
reputation for being dumb.

1394
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:14.710
Where slutty girls and obnoxious boys roam freely until the the bell rings.

1395
01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:17.660
You know what school I thought you were describing.

1396
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:21.410
There's a school on the upper west side.

1397
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:26.270
What the fuck?
I think Paris Hilton went to it.

1398
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.850
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1399
01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:30.150
<v 10>Ah,
see I chase me out.
She knew the name of it.</v>

1400
01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:35.400
I think it was called the Dwight school

1401
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:40.730
and,
and the people said it stood for

1402
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:42.200
<v 12>okay.</v>

1403
01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.570
<v 10>Dumb White idiots getting high together</v>

1404
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:51.350
cause it gets you all like rich kids.
And this kind of sounded like you were a,

1405
01:26:51.351 --> 01:26:54.020
you were describing anyways.
That's a,
that's an old story.
Anyways,

1406
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:58.070
not only does my school have bratty,
annoying,
annoying,

1407
01:26:58.071 --> 01:27:02.700
almost unbelievably ignorant students,
but it is also located in Las Vegas.

1408
01:27:02.701 --> 01:27:05.540
So that's right.
That's how I knew it wasn't at school.
Um,

1409
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:09.290
the hottest slash coldest hole in the west.

1410
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:14.330
I am basically a nobody at school.
When other people talk to me in school,

1411
01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:16.040
they usually describe me as quiet.

1412
01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:20.420
I'm the person who when that one person they talked to all the time doesn't show

1413
01:27:20.421 --> 01:27:23.690
up,
seems more lost and more lonely than usual.

1414
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:26.630
I'm very introverted and people don't really warm up to me,

1415
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:30.080
although I secretly wish they would.
My grades are usually high,

1416
01:27:30.081 --> 01:27:32.030
but since I have always been Mousey,

1417
01:27:32.031 --> 01:27:36.710
I usually have problems making speeches and presentations due to not speaking

1418
01:27:36.711 --> 01:27:39.740
loudly enough and not making any eye contact.
I'm easily,

1419
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:42.560
easily embarrassed and mistake prone.

1420
01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:47.150
And when I'm around my friends,
friends,
when I'm around my friends,
friends,

1421
01:27:47.151 --> 01:27:50.300
teachers and anyone I find intimidating,
um,

1422
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:53.930
all I do is sit there arguably hoping I never have to talk to them to sum it up,

1423
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:57.260
I'm socially inept.
You really should have said to sum it up,
you're,

1424
01:27:57.270 --> 01:28:00.650
you're a teenager.
This is how I was.
I was socially retarded.

1425
01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:02.173
Do you know when I was in,

1426
01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.450
if I was like right up until like sophomore year in high school,

1427
01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.780
if a girl even talked to me,
my face turned beet red.

1428
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.190
It's fucking embarrassing to admit,
but it's true.

1429
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:18.080
It was pathetic and I was only funny around my immediate group of friends.

1430
01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:22.220
If I was in a class and it was basically,
you know,

1431
01:28:22.221 --> 01:28:25.670
a middle of the pack class and there was no real popular people in there,

1432
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:30.740
you know,
either guys or the cheerleader girls,
then,
um,

1433
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:32.030
then I would be myself.

1434
01:28:32.031 --> 01:28:35.270
But if any of the popular P I just knew my role and I just shut the fuck up.

1435
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:40.300
So till this day I have a lot of people who I knew on my past and like,

1436
01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.990
how the fuck did you end up being a comedian?
Dual,

1437
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:47.120
you'll show fucking quiet because I was a fucking psycho.

1438
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.650
Anyways,
person goes on and says the only people who,
uh,

1439
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:57.440
live in this plane,
bug infested house or my mother on a shelf,

1440
01:28:57.441 --> 01:29:01.000
but a life or his life,
I don't even know.
I didn't see the,

1441
01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:03.360
this was guy or girl,
sorry about that.

1442
01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.610
A bug infested house on my mother and me.
My Dad pays for the major bills,

1443
01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:13.110
like the mortgage and rent,
but doesn't live with us for most of the year.
Uh,

1444
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:16.920
he works as a retired civilian for the navy,

1445
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:21.180
doing janitorial work on the ship channels outside of the country.

1446
01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:22.953
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1447
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:27.040
<v 10>My mom works currently at a Vietnamese supermarket and as a cashier,</v>

1448
01:29:27.041 --> 01:29:31.480
yes she is Vietnamese and like most people from there that I observed,
she cares.

1449
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:34.810
She only cares for Vietnamese and Chinese people.
That's hilarious.

1450
01:29:34.811 --> 01:29:37.840
Cause I told that guy he was being sensitive a few weeks ago when he was talking

1451
01:29:37.841 --> 01:29:40.390
about the fucking uh,

1452
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:42.020
<v 11>yeah,</v>

1453
01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.530
<v 10>that lady at the front desk or the dentist office being reverse racist.</v>

1454
01:29:45.531 --> 01:29:47.630
And I was like,
there was no way that happened.
See,

1455
01:29:47.631 --> 01:29:49.880
this is why you shouldn't listen to me.
I don't what the fuck I'm talking about.

1456
01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:54.800
And uh,
I'm going to use your mother as the litmus test for everyone in Asia.

1457
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:56.840
I should just shut the fuck up here anyways.

1458
01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.450
I can't stand her prejudices against other racist.
The biggest,

1459
01:29:59.451 --> 01:30:02.780
most recent mistakes she has made so far is she's tried to open a business and

1460
01:30:02.781 --> 01:30:06.170
it's failed law in less than a year,
which is pretty pathetic.

1461
01:30:06.171 --> 01:30:08.950
We ended up being bankrupt,
um,

1462
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:12.770
and living without water and electricity and had to move around a little bit

1463
01:30:12.771 --> 01:30:16.460
after a while.
We had to make a big change in lifestyle,
which was to move

1464
01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.500
to Las Vegas.
I was furious and upset.
Oh,

1465
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:24.200
I guess this person used to live in San Diego in a neighborhood and always had a

1466
01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:26.930
good time out there.
And now you're at the house.
Uh,

1467
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.740
my two best friends lived in San Diego and we share so much common knowing each

1468
01:30:30.741 --> 01:30:34.130
other in grade school.
And uh,
thirdly,

1469
01:30:34.131 --> 01:30:38.000
my sisters would visit me and take me out of the House and away from my mother.

1470
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:40.560
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1471
01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.280
<v 10>Um,
so what are you asking me here?
Did I skip something?
Oh,</v>

1472
01:30:44.281 --> 01:30:46.260
I have a major reason why I don't want to leave.
Okay.

1473
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:50.930
Your mom's taking you out there when we lived in a nice looking suburb net.
Okay.

1474
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:53.340
All my friends are there,
my parents.
So I have,
okay.

1475
01:30:53.670 --> 01:30:56.310
Even though I can't get away from my current situation,
a life,

1476
01:30:56.311 --> 01:30:59.880
I'm worried about going to college and living on my own was moving away from

1477
01:30:59.881 --> 01:31:03.090
your parents and living independently hard for you?

1478
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.220
Is there anything I should be warned about?
Uh,

1479
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:11.640
no.
You just need to relax and realize that you're a cool person and you're

1480
01:31:11.641 --> 01:31:13.740
overthinking shit,
everything's gonna be fine.

1481
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:15.630
Do you want to learn how to come out of your shell?

1482
01:31:15.631 --> 01:31:19.290
You just work at it the same way you would fucking learn how to play guitar,

1483
01:31:19.291 --> 01:31:22.350
which is to basically do it every day.
You know,

1484
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:26.070
I sucked at guitar three years ago and now I'm um,
um,

1485
01:31:26.130 --> 01:31:31.130
getting halfway decent at guitar because I try to play it every day and the shit

1486
01:31:31.771 --> 01:31:34.020
that I still suck at is a shit I don't work at.

1487
01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:38.040
So what I would do if I was you is just work at coming out of your shell.

1488
01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:40.730
You can try it,
you know,
you go out,
you buy something,

1489
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:45.750
try and make a little Chit Chit chat with the person behind the register if it's

1490
01:31:45.991 --> 01:31:48.720
not fucking automated and a,

1491
01:31:48.721 --> 01:31:51.120
and give yourself license to suck in the beginning.

1492
01:31:51.121 --> 01:31:53.280
That's a big thing about improving shit in your life,

1493
01:31:53.281 --> 01:31:58.260
I found is to forgive the fact that in the beginning when you try to talk to

1494
01:31:58.261 --> 01:32:02.890
other people,
you're a,
you're not going to be good at it at first.
And,
um,

1495
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:06.100
let me ask you this,
have you ever opened your mouth and said something?

1496
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:09.550
And then an entire room of people turned around and looked at you and said,

1497
01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:13.150
what the fuck?
And then they all beat the shit out of you.
I mean,

1498
01:32:13.151 --> 01:32:14.140
that was my fear.

1499
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:17.500
That was my fear in high school that that's what was going to happen.

1500
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:21.010
You know what?
It never happened.
And when I finally did open my mouth,

1501
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:22.090
people are like,
hey,
you're funny.

1502
01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:24.910
You should have been more like that in high school.

1503
01:32:24.911 --> 01:32:29.590
You could have been fucking those fucking cheerleaders,
you know?
So hence,

1504
01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:32.530
I have a lot of regret about that period in my lifetime because I wasn't being

1505
01:32:32.531 --> 01:32:36.920
myself.
So,
um,
I don't know if you're under age,

1506
01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.460
you got to go with your mom.
So,
you know,

1507
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:43.410
you gotta go out there just fucking write it out and you know what?

1508
01:32:43.411 --> 01:32:45.270
It's going to make you a stronger person to go out,
Dan,

1509
01:32:45.271 --> 01:32:49.780
to be a great exercise and coming out of your shell to go there,
be the new kid,

1510
01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:54.370
meet some new people.
And,
um,
as far as moving out,

1511
01:32:54.371 --> 01:32:58.740
the best advice I can give you is get a can opener and all that little innocuous

1512
01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:03.070
bullshit that you take for granted in your mother's house.
Um,

1513
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:08.890
you know,
and then,
I dunno,
don't,
uh,
don't hang around with assholes,

1514
01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:10.871
you know,

1515
01:33:10.871 --> 01:33:14.440
don't hang out with psychos and by I don't mean psychos like the standing there

1516
01:33:14.441 --> 01:33:15.450
with a bloody ax,
but you know,

1517
01:33:15.451 --> 01:33:18.520
all those PE people play like fucking mind games with you and you feel them

1518
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:22.300
getting competitive with you.
Those aren't friends,
you know,
are you going,

1519
01:33:22.301 --> 01:33:23.680
it can happen like one or two times,

1520
01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:28.450
but you address it and if it continues to happen,
dump them because it's just,

1521
01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.840
you know,
those are the kinds of people that if you start doing well in life,

1522
01:33:31.841 --> 01:33:34.660
they actually resent you.
And uh,

1523
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:38.350
it's kind of like that guy before earlier that I was talking about with that

1524
01:33:38.351 --> 01:33:43.300
woman kind of,
you know,
saved them a lot of pain by leaving early.

1525
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:47.380
You can do that with friends yourself.
Does that make any sense?
You know,

1526
01:33:47.410 --> 01:33:49.350
the second he starts seeing someone's being a Douche,

1527
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.330
if your gut is telling you that they are a Douche and there's no reason to be

1528
01:33:52.331 --> 01:33:54.970
around them.
But uh,
I hope that helps you out.

1529
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:56.560
I'm kind of rushing through here though,

1530
01:33:56.561 --> 01:34:00.760
cause I got to only like eight minutes left here before I got to get on.
Um,

1531
01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.990
all right,
Bill.
Um,
his last advice when I'm going to read bill,

1532
01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:06.130
I've been going out with this girl for,

1533
01:34:06.131 --> 01:34:08.050
I love how I'm giving relationship advice yet.

1534
01:34:08.051 --> 01:34:11.200
I've never had a successful relationship,

1535
01:34:11.290 --> 01:34:14.320
although I like to think this one's a little successful,
don't you Nia?

1536
01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:18.100
Who's sneaking around the room?
You find you find this relationship successful?

1537
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:22.210
<v 9>Oh,
define successful.</v>

1538
01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:27.870
<v 10>We have healthy arguments,
don't we?</v>

1539
01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:30.250
<v 9>Yeah.
Hi.
Yeah.</v>

1540
01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.570
<v 10>Wow.
That was hilarious for you went.
Yeah.
And then you're like,
wait,</v>

1541
01:34:33.571 --> 01:34:37.050
that didn't sound like a good,
yeah,
we do.

1542
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:40.860
All right.
You know what?
That was right the first time.
Beat it.

1543
01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:41.730
Let me finish this.

1544
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:44.583
<v 9>Oh,
okay.</v>

1545
01:34:46.110 --> 01:34:48.630
<v 10>You didn't have to put that over there.
You just trying to stay in here longer.</v>

1546
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.150
All right,
well let's plow ahead here.
Bill.

1547
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:54.120
I been going out with this girl for a little over a year and she's been,

1548
01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.770
she's beginning to Piss me off.

1549
01:34:58.930 --> 01:35:00.680
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
He,
you know,

1550
01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:03.080
at this question could be for about 9,000 people right now.

1551
01:35:03.081 --> 01:35:06.950
She complains about not having any money and never offers to pay when we go out

1552
01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:10.340
somewhere.
But when she goes out with their friends to the bar or something,

1553
01:35:10.341 --> 01:35:13.220
she spends it like no fucking tomorrow as a man.

1554
01:35:13.221 --> 01:35:18.080
I don't mind paying for shit most of the time,
but fucking offer to pay,
you know.

1555
01:35:18.081 --> 01:35:21.920
But fucking offered to pay would be a great,
would be great sometime,

1556
01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:25.580
but fucking offering to pay.
See,
it's not always my reading.

1557
01:35:25.581 --> 01:35:28.040
Sometimes people don't write shit correctly,

1558
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:32.360
but fucking offering to pay would be great sometime.
Um,

1559
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:35.900
I don't want to seem like an ass making the girl pay for Shit,

1560
01:35:35.901 --> 01:35:39.830
but give me a fucking break.
Times have changed.
Equality is prevailing.

1561
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:43.610
So why don't you throw some dough like the guys do a,

1562
01:35:43.611 --> 01:35:47.270
what should I do to get her to start spending some money on me or at least

1563
01:35:47.271 --> 01:35:50.930
fucking offer without me making me out to be the Dick?

1564
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.350
Basically tell me what you just told me and take out all the fucks.

1565
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:58.880
That's seriously dude,
that's the secret.
You have to,
you have to,

1566
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:02.900
and I had to do this because I have a temper and I say fuck every other word.

1567
01:36:02.901 --> 01:36:07.901
I would literally sit down with a piece of paper and I would write the,

1568
01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:13.900
the two or three points that I was trying to make and um,

1569
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:20.330
just to make sure that I,
I didn't,
you know,
that this is what I wanted to say.

1570
01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:23.090
And then I would also,
and then I would draw out this happened,
I have a,

1571
01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:26.810
how much of a psycho I was,
I had to draw a little smiley face next to it,

1572
01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:31.811
which would remind me not to say it with my usual angry east coast tone.

1573
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:34.520
All right,

1574
01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.520
so what you have to tell her is that basically what you tell me then a big thing

1575
01:36:39.651 --> 01:36:40.071
with women,

1576
01:36:40.071 --> 01:36:44.450
you've got to tell how it makes you feel when she doesn't offer to pay.

1577
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:48.200
All right?
Yet you have to sit there and listen to her,
you know,

1578
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:52.400
complaining about money yet she doesn't offer to pay and how it makes you feel

1579
01:36:52.401 --> 01:36:55.490
when you then see her throwing the money around with their friends and makes you

1580
01:36:55.491 --> 01:36:56.420
feel like what?

1581
01:36:57.590 --> 01:37:00.950
Like she's treating you see I was going to say like an ATM.

1582
01:37:00.951 --> 01:37:03.560
See this is what happens when I will write shit down.
That's very hostile.

1583
01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:05.960
He treated me like a fucking ATM.
What?

1584
01:37:05.961 --> 01:37:09.590
I'm not good enough to spend fucking money on you fucking whore so you can't go

1585
01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:12.680
that route.
You got it.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1586
01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:17.300
[inaudible] what the fuck are you eating lately?
Just gassing me out.

1587
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:24.440
You know.
So I am convinced with dogs that there,
there is no like,
uh,

1588
01:37:25.650 --> 01:37:29.360
is no toxins built up in them.
They just don't give a shit.
You know,

1589
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:33.440
they got a fucking rip one.
They just do.
Um,
anyways,
that's what you have to do.

1590
01:37:33.450 --> 01:37:38.030
You've got to tell out how that makes you feel,
you know,
um,

1591
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:43.310
and just,
I dunno,
you know what the more you do with you,

1592
01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.510
you're going to learn how to do it.

1593
01:37:44.511 --> 01:37:48.710
And it's like keywords that you can use with women that makes their ears perk up

1594
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:52.820
per cup without getting mad at you is basically,
if you say,

1595
01:37:52.821 --> 01:37:56.220
it makes me feel like this.
And you used words like,
you know,

1596
01:37:56.221 --> 01:37:59.400
I just kind of feel like there's a lack of respect there.
I mean that's,

1597
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:01.560
you gotta go like this way more,
uh,

1598
01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:04.830
sort of mature way and not because they're more mature.

1599
01:38:04.831 --> 01:38:06.480
So get off your high horse is ladies,

1600
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:10.530
you just have to go that way or else they will fucking turn it around on you.

1601
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:14.760
Okay.
The fact that you're fucking paying for everything,

1602
01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:19.050
somehow that point will,
you'll somehow be in the wrong.

1603
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.320
And um,
there's two ways to know you're winning an argument with the female is,

1604
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:29.240
uh,
one,
they're trying to pull some fucking Jujitsu,

1605
01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.580
double reverse two point reversal fucking move on you.

1606
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:36.420
And a lot of times last,

1607
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:41.630
their last ditch suicide bomber fucking mood move is they cry.

1608
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:48.330
All right?
And the thing about is a guy,
if you want to win an argument,
the woman,

1609
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:49.830
okay?
And I'm not just saying win,

1610
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:52.200
but you really want to make your point when you know you're right,

1611
01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:53.460
because you're right on this one.

1612
01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.700
If your version of what's going on is actually going on,

1613
01:38:56.701 --> 01:38:59.070
you're fucking right on this one,
okay?

1614
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:03.480
So what you have to do is not lose your cool.
You cannot get,

1615
01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.760
you don't take the bait and she'll do shit.

1616
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.590
She'll bring up shit from your fucking childhood.
She'll bring up,
oh,

1617
01:39:09.591 --> 01:39:10.890
and you didn't do the fucking dishes.

1618
01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:15.690
She'll do something if you get a dead to rights,
okay?
If you,
if you don't,

1619
01:39:15.691 --> 01:39:19.350
if you do,
it all depends on her personality.
If she's a real defensive,

1620
01:39:19.351 --> 01:39:23.520
combative person,
you really got to watch out for that breed.
Okay?

1621
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:25.170
Those little terrier fucking women,

1622
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:29.030
what you gotta do is just know that she's going to say all that stuff and that

1623
01:39:29.031 --> 01:39:32.760
you,
you got to keep your fucking cool.
And once they start,

1624
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:35.370
you don't have to go name calling or something like that.
That's just,

1625
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:40.770
that's hostile.
They basically,
that's a fucking word I can never remember.

1626
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:45.780
Um,
God dammit,
you know,
uh,
capitulate,

1627
01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:49.200
that's a great word too.
If you use that commonly,

1628
01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:52.460
it's basically is when you just abandon your,
the,

1629
01:39:52.461 --> 01:39:54.540
the argument and you just start,

1630
01:39:54.541 --> 01:39:57.750
you don't reverting to like name calling or you abandon your argument and they

1631
01:39:57.751 --> 01:40:00.420
start agreeing with you or something like that.
I don't fucking know.

1632
01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:05.910
It just sounds great to say it.
But anyways,
um,

1633
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.660
you gotta do,
you got it.
You'd write down what you want to say,

1634
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:12.330
say it and just say how you feeling.

1635
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:17.460
Take out all the fucks and if she tries to turn it around on you,
you know,

1636
01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:21.570
by bringing,
if she starts bringing up other shit while you do this,

1637
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:26.310
will you do that?
And he don't,
don't allow that.
You know what I mean?

1638
01:40:27.450 --> 01:40:30.630
And if she wants to talk about,
you know,
I,
you leave your shoes,
you know,

1639
01:40:30.631 --> 01:40:34.440
in the middle of the living room and be like,
okay,
well before we discuss that,

1640
01:40:34.441 --> 01:40:38.040
can we,
can we finish discussing this?
You just got to keep steering it back.

1641
01:40:38.041 --> 01:40:39.570
It's like fucking law and order.

1642
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:42.510
You've got to cross examine them and I'm telling you,

1643
01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.430
watch out for that crying bullshit.
All right?
Cause that's a latch diff.

1644
01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:52.230
That's their fucking 60 yard field goal or hail Mary pass when they know that

1645
01:40:52.231 --> 01:40:54.340
they're going to fucking lose.
And I'm telling you,

1646
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:55.900
they're all there like Meryl Streep.

1647
01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:59.590
That's why I'm not blown away by Meryl Streep.
Okay.
You know,

1648
01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:04.080
have my girlfriends can fucking act as good as she can at bullshit.

1649
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:08.890
She's a great actress,
just being a Douche.
Um,
so anyways,

1650
01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:12.190
there you go.
That's how you do it.
All right?
And that's how you win an argument.

1651
01:41:12.610 --> 01:41:16.390
If you're right,
or at least that's how you,
you make your point.
Okay.

1652
01:41:16.391 --> 01:41:19.630
And if they wanted to revert to name calling and bring up shift from your

1653
01:41:19.631 --> 01:41:20.350
childhood,

1654
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:23.560
just don't take the bait and then what's going to end up happening is they're

1655
01:41:23.561 --> 01:41:28.360
just going to be sitting there feeling like a jerk.
And um,
you know,

1656
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:31.270
if they're mature enough then they'll apologize for the name calling and say,

1657
01:41:31.271 --> 01:41:34.360
I was actually wrong.
I got defenses,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1658
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:37.780
But if there's psycho,
they'll actually try to cry their way out of it.

1659
01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.510
And I'm just know this,

1660
01:41:40.511 --> 01:41:45.340
that when an adult is beyond the age of,
uh,
eight,

1661
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:50.980
if you didn't punch them in the face or call them some horrific name,

1662
01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:55.090
there's really no reason to be crying.
So if they are crying,
you know,

1663
01:41:57.250 --> 01:41:59.530
it's like those fucking commercials here on the radio,

1664
01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.190
they give you a free car and you don't have to give him any money till like

1665
01:42:03.191 --> 01:42:07.790
September of 2015.
It,
it's,
it,
it sounds like bullshit,
doesn't it?

1666
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:11.170
It has to be somehow you're getting fucked.
And that's the same way it is.

1667
01:42:11.171 --> 01:42:15.370
Like most of the times when women are crying.
All right.
Okay,

1668
01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.240
let's get on to some questions here.
Um,
oh,
by the way,

1669
01:42:19.241 --> 01:42:21.190
I gave this guy shit talking about how,
you know,

1670
01:42:21.191 --> 01:42:24.190
games weren't invented in England.
What the fuck is he talking about?

1671
01:42:24.191 --> 01:42:29.191
And here's somebody actually was trying to tell me that I was wrong on that one.

1672
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:32.760
Said I would thought ever respond to your comments about,
uh,

1673
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:36.190
what sports did the English had invent.
Um,

1674
01:42:36.191 --> 01:42:39.790
I think the English did invent baseball.
It was called rounders,

1675
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:44.650
like in the 17 or 18 hundreds and it was played mostly by girls.

1676
01:42:44.650 --> 01:42:48.820
Not Kidding.
Look it up.
I actually looked it up.
Um,

1677
01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:54.040
and it seems like,
yeah,
there is a game called rounders,
but that's one of those,

1678
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.903
you know,

1679
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.580
that's like one of those things like somebody invents a guitar and then they

1680
01:42:57.581 --> 01:43:02.380
take credit for Jimi Hendrix,
you know,
I dunno.
Maybe I'm,

1681
01:43:02.381 --> 01:43:06.940
then I'm exaggerating.
Um,
I just don't understand why.

1682
01:43:06.941 --> 01:43:11.440
If there is a game like baseball in England,
why you would play cricket,
you know,

1683
01:43:11.441 --> 01:43:14.770
and don't they where a bunch of pads,
those big catcher pads don't,

1684
01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:16.580
they wear that shit and he was just plow ahead.
Um,

1685
01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:20.440
besides what you mentioned on the podcast,
they also invented,

1686
01:43:21.190 --> 01:43:24.980
he wrote Bob's sleigh.
Is that Bob sledding,

1687
01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:31.330
tennis,
Ping Pong table tennis.
Golf in badminton.

1688
01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:36.160
Well,
if you want to take credit for those fucking sissy games,
go for it.

1689
01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:39.130
Bad mitten.
Really Ping Pong.

1690
01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:43.660
I like how you keep inventing games that then other people dominate golf.

1691
01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:48.070
Tiger Woods.
Thank you.
Ping Pong.
China.

1692
01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:52.220
You lose that one.
Tennis was the last saving from England,
England.

1693
01:43:52.221 --> 01:43:54.980
One to fucking Wimbleton never.

1694
01:43:55.690 --> 01:43:58.430
You got to go back to when only white people were allowed to play and they were

1695
01:43:58.431 --> 01:44:03.110
a little fucking a cutoff slacks.
No,
actually they work.
No,
they wore slacks.

1696
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:03.531
That's right.

1697
01:44:03.531 --> 01:44:08.531
There were full length pants and they had wooden rackets that the later use to

1698
01:44:09.170 --> 01:44:12.500
hit a woman over the head with sick fucking have a girlfriend,
um,

1699
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:17.180
bad mitten who plays badminton.
Members of your royal family.

1700
01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:20.240
All right.
Um,
I said I wasn't going to be a jerk,
but I,

1701
01:44:20.241 --> 01:44:23.930
and I ended up being a jerk.
Let's close out here with the questions.
Uh,
Bill,

1702
01:44:23.931 --> 01:44:26.840
I recently started,
you know what?
It's one,
all three.
What the fuck am I doing?

1703
01:44:26.841 --> 01:44:30.590
I got to get to the questions next week.
I gave out a lot of vices week.
No,

1704
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:33.260
always.
No.
My disclaimer,
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1705
01:44:33.261 --> 01:44:37.100
All I can do is a judge,
you know,
go from my own life here.

1706
01:44:37.101 --> 01:44:41.990
How I've handled some shit as the psycho that I am.
All right.
Ah,
Shit.

1707
01:44:41.991 --> 01:44:44.150
That was 53 minutes,
so I didn't even do a short one.

1708
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:47.120
Hope you guys all have a good week and please come out and check me out,
uh,

1709
01:44:47.121 --> 01:44:49.370

1710
01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:51.920
I'm in a Addison at the Improv this weekend.

1711
01:44:52.330 --> 01:44:56.090
I'm at the stress factory in New Jersey next weekend and the weekend after that,

1712
01:44:56.091 --> 01:44:59.390

1713
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.040
