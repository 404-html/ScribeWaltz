00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.660
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.661 --> 00:00:05.720
It's Bill Byrd is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:09.710
September 17th,

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.730
2018 how's it going?
How are you?
What's up with you?

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.940
Um,
how was your football Sunday?
I know what's going on with me.

6
00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:22.220
Like I felt like I had a cold,
now I don't know what I have and uh,

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.200
my wife's like,
well maybe you have allergies.
It's like,
I don't have allergies.

8
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:30.590
I've never had allergies in my life.
And she's just like,
whoa.

9
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.640
Sometimes there's,
there's late onset allergies.

10
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.580
So she's got me thinking I have allergies.
I never,
you know,

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.650
I thought allergies for like,
people who had like inferior DNA,
you know,

12
00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:47.710
just like weak people,
you know,

13
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.160
like the kind of puppy that the mother ignores and just lets it die.

14
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.190
It doesn't want to let it get any milk,
you know?

15
00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:56.640
But we're human beings and everybody's specialty.

16
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.650
Keep these people going and then they just walk around constant state of like,

17
00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:06.160
you know,
listening to their nasally voices.
Oh my God,

18
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:10.150
did somebody eat lobster and the last month and then you got to like fucking

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.790
vaccinate your house,
whatever it is,

20
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.140
d fumigate your house because somebody with allergies comes by,

21
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.210
you know,
but ever deadly.
I'm one of those people,

22
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.320
you know,
my mom should have ignored me.
Who Knew?

23
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.110
Who knew I maybe I have late onset.
Who the fuck it's allergies.

24
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:32.944
It's 50.

25
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.540
You is funny about how you are the nonmedical people out there right now.

26
00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:40.600
What are you doing?
You listen to his podcast and now you're googling the shit,

27
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.470
right?
Everybody's just a dick to them and get the answer right now.
You know?

28
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.600
Do you ever theatrical consider the source,

29
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.280
not to mention the of the,
the fucking guy who's a,

30
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.940
you know,
looking for the information,

31
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.620
being you not having a fucking medical degree all of a sudden your year like

32
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.870
some doctor,
I do it all the time.

33
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:06.360
That's why I got a nutritionist because I was trying to learn about food.

34
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:10.920
I just couldn't figure it out.
Everybody just,
you know,

35
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:14.490
at a conflicting opinion,
it was like these God damn,
uh,

36
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.110
feminists and uh,
the guys with the date rape drug,

37
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.280
they just can't seem to get on the same page.

38
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.860
Now it's like Democrats,
Republicans,
you know what I mean?

39
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.000
<v 1>They all agree on what the problems are and they're just sitting there pointing</v>

41
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.150
fingers at each other.
These fucking people in,
in the food industry,

42
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.380
it's the same thing.
You know,

43
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:38.750
I get the fucking giants cowboys game on and there's some fucking asshole.

44
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.390
He literally is sitting on the field at a little too top table.

45
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.670
How much of those tickets,

46
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.170
these guys are running around fucking smashing their brains out,
right?
And the,

47
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.760
and the,
that's an incomplete pass and they,
the guy puts his hands up like,

48
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:55.330
where's the flag sitting there?
Like fucking Julius.

49
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.190
<v 1>What does he see?
A high</v>

51
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 0>ranking official at the Home Depot corporate office.</v>

52
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.520
<v 1>You imagine like the jobs that we have nowadays.</v>

53
00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:13.050
Can you fucking imagine if you just met people from the past and they're just

54
00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:18.040
looking at it like you'd do what,
what do you do it?

55
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.990
We'd all be saying this shit and then just be like,

56
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.450
they would all be just looking at it.
You don't do anything

57
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.760
and your wife does what?

58
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.210
She white like the whole fucking nothing would make sense.

59
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.570
You know?
I wonder if there's going to be like that in a hundred years.

60
00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:38.690
Like we can actually,
you know,
if we were still around a couple of hundred years,

61
00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:43.220
we could just fucking look down on people and what their jobs are because robots

62
00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:46.730
are now fucking,
I dunno,
entering data.
I Dunno.
People.

63
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.890
I don't pretend to understand,

64
00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:51.830
but how did you guys in Jab was your second week of football?

65
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.960
Mine was a,
you know,
I mean we lost it wasn't that big a deal though.

66
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

67
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.080
<v 1>Yeah.
Everyone's going to make a big deal.
I know.
Edelman's not back yet.</v>

68
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:05.980
It's the second week of the fucking season,
you know?
You know what?

69
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:08.820
What do you,
what do you know what?
What the fuck?
Okay,
good.
Fucking Jacksonville.

70
00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:11.040
They're all going to be fucking freaking out.
Oh my God,

71
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:15.420
we finally beat the Patriots.
Does this mean we win the Superbowl?
Right.

72
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:19.470
That's what everybody does.
Everybody gets all fucking excited.
Like,

73
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.270
you know when you watch an action movie,
you know the Rambo Guy,

74
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:27.440
is he freaking out now the Chuck Norris Freak out now,
you know,
freaks out.

75
00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:31.820
The guy was going to fucking die.
That's so,
so everybody relax.

76
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.070
You know,
jets fans.

77
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.370
How many times are you going to get to the ego to let the Lazy New York sports

78
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:42.830
media fucking gas up another guy?

79
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.590
All right.
He said to fucking solid weeks.
He's gone.
One and one.

80
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.610
He's thrown for 300 yards.
Whatever.
Fucking uh,
both weeks.
Very impressive.

81
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.040
You know,
but you don't become a legend.
It's September.

82
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.640
I know you're hopeful.
I mean,
even the firemen came back.
What?

83
00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:07.410
Where did he come back?
You guys were such conch.

84
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.070
You know what the fuck is wrong?
The jet Fed Steve,
they chased a fireman.

85
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.850
How long have you curse for post nine 11 in New York,

86
00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:24.230
you chased a fireman out of your own fucking stadium and you got the balls to

87
00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:28.040
think that a couple of decent weeks of football.

88
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.870
Then all of a sudden you're walking down the street talking to the camera talk,

89
00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:37.190
call it out,
Tom Brady,
Tom Brady,
the man,

90
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:40.550
you guys all we all wanted to be Tom Brady.
We all wouldn't be good looking.

91
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.170
Be The quarterback.
Marry a supermodel,
have a nice fucking temple in our chin,

92
00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:49.420
full head of fucking hair.
Mary and I already said that part right fucking way.

93
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.270
When five fucking super balls

94
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.080
get a respectful fucking nod from Montana's.

95
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.530
You're putting on your yellow fucking jacket,
right?

96
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.460
We all wanted that.
All right,

97
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.901
well guess what?

98
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:12.680
Despite all these fucking Instagram accounts out there that are telling you,

99
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.681
you can do anything you want and everybody's fucking special reality is there's

100
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.930
only one Tom Brady.
All right,

101
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.500
so are you green couch down there?
I'm happy for you.

102
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.950
I'm happy that you're excited,
but you might want to reel it in a little bit.

103
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.030
You know,
you have to have a friend of yours every time he fucking made a check,

104
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.940
he thinks that's the one
you know,
and he'd just go like,

105
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.330
I'm at the pick this guy up off the fucking mad again.

106
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.540
How many times can I sit across from,
you should cry it in your fucking beer.

107
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.170
All right.
When you just gonna fuck abroad and move on,

108
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.450
that's the problem with these jets fans.
They're fucking romantics.

109
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.450
Oh,
they fell as he lie right there.
That's the lie.
I know.

110
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.480
Thrown for a touchdown with a minute and a half left.
Too little too late.

111
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:05.280
You know,
they probably let them go right down in the field.

112
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

113
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.390
<v 1>I love listening to people.
Flip out this time of year.
You know I'm,</v>

114
00:07:12.391 --> 00:07:15.810
I'm actually,
okay.
I'm taping this Sunday night.
All right.

115
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.250
I'm going to predict.
Nobody's going to go around the league.

116
00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:21.240
Look at the scores here.

117
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:25.980
I'm going to predict the fucking overhyping me with my fucking 50 year old

118
00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:29.760
allergies.
I have allergies.
I can't,
and there's no final,
I won't allow it.

119
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.260
Very have a varicose vein.
I can't.
I can't fucking compound that with an allergy.

120
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.243
<v 2>MMM.</v>

121
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.290
<v 1>Anyways,
when I had it right here,
I had the NFL scores deny.</v>

122
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.200
Is that what happened now?

123
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:47.201
Now why wouldn't you go for two there then you're only down by nine.

124
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:50.610
That's just three.
Three drives with three field goals you could get back in.

125
00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:54.080
This came with the May 28 left.
I mean he,

126
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.200
he's going to how you're going to have some,

127
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.040
some fucking questions to answer after this game by people who never got picked

128
00:07:59.041 --> 00:07:59.874
in gym class.

129
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:01.743
<v 2>Uh,</v>

130
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.060
<v 1>all right,
let's go around the league.
Here we go.
The scores here.
All right.</v>

131
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.880
This is what,
this is what my predictions are going to be.
All right.

132
00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:12.740
The chiefs I made,
I'll tell you right now,
I see it.

133
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:16.940
A lot of people cognitive delay,
but there's Patrick,
my homemade.

134
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.180
However you say his a homes.
I mean this guy,

135
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.010
if he keeps this shop,

136
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.750
<v 0>yeah.</v>

137
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.750
<v 1>[inaudible] just shitty will be undefeated.</v>

138
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.900
They were when your first show but super Superbowl for and Patrick [inaudible]

139
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.580
is going to have the greatest season ever in the history of the NFL.

140
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.560
I do have to tell you though,
if Patrick,

141
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.590
my hallways Wa my homes was fucking doing this shit for the jets or anywhere in

142
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:50.120
New York,
good Lord,
they would have declared a fucking state of emergency onside.

143
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:53.930
Kick the giants.
Get the ball.
Look at this.

144
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.310
Here we go to go.
There's still not enough fucking time left.
Um,

145
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.970
but this is when he has a gambling man.
You like this is fucking fixed,
right?

146
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:06.600
Flipping out.
Although I think Joey's were favored by Ron.
I have no idea.
Um,

147
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.280
<v 0>okay.</v>

148
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.150
<v 1>They're gonna fucking sit there and freak the fuck out.
Uh,</v>

149
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.750
Ryan Fitzpatrick,
I made a pocket.

150
00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:19.751
Is Jesus fucking Christ shit to it all the first jibe since fucking 2014 this is

151
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.600
going to be there year.
I don't know shit about anything at this point.

152
00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:29.420
All I can say about the Buccaneers is there are two at all.

153
00:09:29.421 --> 00:09:33.140
They've scored 75 points and they've led up 61.

154
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.480
All right.
40 of those fucking points where the God damn saints.

155
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.100
So you know,
I dunno,
you know,
you don't,
you know,

156
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.050
fucking win games,
48 40 and shit like that in the,
uh,

157
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.460
in the playoffs.
So I would be relaxed with them.
You know who,

158
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:56.060
obviously the most impressive team in the league has gotta be the fucking ramps.

159
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:57.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

160
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.460
<v 1>This scored 67 points and only let up 13.</v>

161
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:04.500
I know they played the fucking Raiders day bucket Daikon Day,

162
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.180
but they did what they were supposed to do.
They beat the shit out of him

163
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.190
after all locked cluster first.

164
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:15.120
Fucking hap a Jaguars look good though.

165
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.480
But anytime he got Tom Kauflin anywhere near it,
you're going to win.

166
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.830
They look good.
Uh,
patriots,
you know,
who knows.
I Dunno.

167
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.230
Maybe we'll see.
We'll see what happens with Edelman comes back.

168
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:31.090
We had a couple of fucking injuries.
I don't believe in the dolphins,

169
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.850
even though that two window,
I feel bad for the bills.
Uh,
the chiefs,

170
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:37.020
God knows the chiefs.

171
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.850
The chiefs loved nothing more than fucking fucking stroke.
And they have fans.

172
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:45.780
It's September.
We'll their fans finally get to bust a nut.

173
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.360
Come playoff time.
Oh,
are they once again?

174
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.670
Go home with fucking blue balls.
Um,

175
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.320
who else?
I think that's fucking it.
Mozilo packers.

176
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.470
I liked the packers.
I liked the rams.

177
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.300
And then I liked the direction the Jaguars are going in and the chiefs,

178
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.990
I just too many fucking times they did it last year.

179
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.860
Everybody gets all fucking excited and they'd pop up above ops and the holidays

180
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:16.980
come along and right there,

181
00:11:16.981 --> 00:11:20.790
they all start dressing up like fucking native Americans,
you know,

182
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:23.310
the too much pumpkin bread and then the digital shit,

183
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.140
the bed and fucking November.
I have no idea.

184
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:28.320
And basically I'm judging the entire franchise and what they've done in the
past,

185
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.260
even though they probably have brand new personnel.
I still believe,

186
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:35.190
I still believe in John Gruden
despite all these things.

187
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.370
Is it time for concern?
I mean,

188
00:11:39.371 --> 00:11:43.530
if they go all in three is John Crow on the hot seat?
See,

189
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.270
uh,
I know they were winning all day today and then they lost at the end.

190
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:50.160
But this is a fucking franchise.

191
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:54.090
Said he's been fucking lost at sea a long time.

192
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.330
I've been impressed with,
you know,
John Cruden played a great day.

193
00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:01.450
His team played a great first half against the best team in the league,

194
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:02.850
I think the fucking rams.

195
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.043
<v 2>MMM.</v>

196
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.700
<v 1>Oh,
the most impressive teams so far.
And uh,
you know,</v>

197
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.840
play damn good against the Broncos.
Dot.
Good enough,
long enough or whatever.

198
00:12:12.841 --> 00:12:15.540
I still believe in this guy.
So then today's my two sets.

199
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.610
There's my fucking white noise,

200
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.220
no pun intended to Eli goes DB.
Ah,

201
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.790
and complete.
Um,

202
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.660
you what they said when I was watching the Patriots game,

203
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.893
<v 2>uh,</v>

204
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.080
<v 1>what's his face there?
Tony?
Robot one nother fucking gym.</v>

205
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.130
Another gem.
Like he just like every second,
like what the site called flying.

206
00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:43.950
Every time you fly you learn something.
Right?

207
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.300
Every time you listen to a game it Tony Romo is,
is doing the color.

208
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.070
You fucking learn something.
He,
there was a guy in the Jag was,

209
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.160
he had our guy beat Eddie was running along.
There was this,
you know,

210
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.830
burn along the sideline,
want to be called that fucking pattern.

211
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.890
And he was right on the sideline and Tony said if he ran two yards,

212
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.400
<v 0>okay.</v>

213
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.650
<v 1>More like more towards the field.</v>

214
00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.480
It's such an easy to throw for the quarterback.

215
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:15.230
He said he actually ran the root wrong.
I don't know if he got forced out side,

216
00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:18.710
but just,
you know,
Tony's also going to side with the fucking quarterback,

217
00:13:18.711 --> 00:13:20.360
but it was so fucking interesting going on.
Yeah.

218
00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:22.850
Because then he can maybe throw to the outside of the shoulder.

219
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:26.660
Neck still has a step or a step and a half to adjust to the ball.

220
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.670
If you just run right on the sideline.

221
00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:30.380
The fucking guys like a half step behind you.

222
00:13:30.381 --> 00:13:32.360
Now he has to throw a God damn strike.

223
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

224
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:39.160
<v 1>What is the Eli Manning and the the fucking last drive of a super bowl.
Uh,</v>

225
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.190
all right,
enough of that fucking talk.
Uh,
it's still really early.
Um,

226
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:48.170
I called the my bookie people.
I pick the Jaguars.

227
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.683
<v 2>MMM.</v>

228
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.140
<v 1>I talked to Paul Versey.</v>

229
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:57.141
I picked the lions is lock of the week was San Francisco and I was like,

230
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:02.610
I don't think,
I don't think the fucking lines are as bad as that first game.

231
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.400
That's the thing.
When you shit the bed the first fucking week,

232
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.740
cause you gotta have a game where you just suck.
What are you 60 games?

233
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:13.560
Just going to come off flight.
You just going to fucking suck.
Right.

234
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.040
But when it happens the first week of the year,
everybody looks at like us.

235
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.720
It's just what they're going to do all year,
right?
Yeah.

236
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.850
We get you get you made your point.
All right.
Whatever.

237
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.593
<v 2>Uh,</v>

238
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.180
<v 1>I picked the giants,</v>

239
00:14:25.181 --> 00:14:28.270
I'm going to lose this one and I had one other one I think I went to and one I

240
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:31.420
went to and one of the first week with my book and I think it went to one this

241
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.280
week.
I call them in every week.

242
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:36.190
I called the sports gambling Parkchester now I give you my pics.

243
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.210
<v 2>MMM.</v>

244
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.140
<v 1>And my lock of the week was that somebody was going to get fired for criticizing</v>

245
00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:45.140
the f the woman that did the play by play and I was fucking wrong.

246
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.430
I thought someone was going to do,

247
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:51.431
someone was going to fucking jump on that fish hook and that that was going to

248
00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:55.600
be at um,
anyways,

249
00:14:55.601 --> 00:15:00.130
congratulations to frank or passing Curtis Martin very quietly.

250
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.650
The guy's forth all time.

251
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.680
I don't know if you get to see too many more of these guys.

252
00:15:05.681 --> 00:15:07.540
The way they fucking throw handoffs now,

253
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.380
the only people in front of them now is Walter Payton,

254
00:15:11.381 --> 00:15:13.930
Barry Sanders and a Emmitt Smith.

255
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.770
And I don't think anybody's ever going to catch em at the way the game has

256
00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:21.190
changed.
Uh,
and that's it.

257
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.710
There you go.
There's my,

258
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.740
there's my fucking take the whole fucking thing for this week.

259
00:15:28.921 --> 00:15:30.760
All right.
How long,
how long did that burn up?

260
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.720
15 and a half minutes to your life that you're never going to get back.

261
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.450
Um,
all right.
This weekend I am scheduled to be out in Virginia.

262
00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:45.100
I think those gigs will be good.
Uh,
and then I'm in South Carolina.

263
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:50.060
I haven't been keeping it up too much on the hurricane.
I just keep seeing.
Yeah.

264
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.140
I hate to see,
you know,
who the fuck wants to watch people losing their houses?

265
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.140
I don't get,
why do I want to watch that?

266
00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

267
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.150
<v 1>What's the name of it?
Hurricane Florence.</v>

268
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.260
The hurricane Fitzpatrick or cane Florence.

269
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.780
Hurricane Flo Jo.
Hurricane Florence.

270
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:15.270
Florence wreaks havoc in north and South Carolina.
All right.
So Virginia is,
okay,

271
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.550
so I've got two gigs there.

272
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.310
This is the hardest thing after a hurricane happens,

273
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.860
is who do you give your money to?

274
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.770
You know what I mean?

275
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:33.550
How do I make sure the money that I'm going to donate gets to the right fucking

276
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.010
gets to that person.
I've seen it on TV by the way.

277
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:39.140
You see all these people getting rescued.
All those old people,

278
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:42.410
people in wheelchairs,
fucking broke ass people.
That's what I was talking about.

279
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:44.960
People who did you get the fuck out of there?
A lot of them can't.

280
00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.640
Lot of them can't.
Uh Oh man,
look at that.

281
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:51.380
Jesus fucking Christ.

282
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.450
Do you see that thing that Rogan fucking posted on the Instagram who that guy

283
00:16:56.451 --> 00:16:56.990
was?

284
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.670
He was doing this weird thing was he's trying to act like he was leading into

285
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.070
the wind and it just didn't look real.

286
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.100
And then two people walk by in the background,
like totally normal.

287
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.300
I love when that fucking happens.

288
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.210
The best one ever is where the guy was in the boat.
And then people just walk by.

289
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.860
Uh,
and then what are you going to do at that point?

290
00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:17.360
Is he gonna get out of the boat?

291
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.860
I like the camera man to how he's moved was the guy he tried to do with solid

292
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.030
must be his drinking buddy or something like that.
Uh,

293
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.950
so anyways,
alright,
well,
Hurricane Florida,
hopefully,
uh,

294
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.350
the waters will recede at a little bit.
I don't work.

295
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.150
I Dunno.

296
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.690
I got gotta check with my agent to see if the South Carolina was still going on.

297
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.340
Jesus Christ.

298
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.950
I want to have those fucking bankers that main off all that fucking money after

299
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.580
those people that you'll watch them lose their house if even there,

300
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.880
you know there's not an ounce of fucking guilty.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
you did that.

301
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:56.760
If they don't give a fuck,
they don't give a fuck.

302
00:17:56.761 --> 00:18:00.780
Here we are going after fucking isis where these fat fucking cons.

303
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.080
Who fucked everybody?
Their own chantry man,

304
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.190
at least isis has the decency to go after people that have that,

305
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.500
that aren't their own countrymen,
these fucking bankers that God,

306
00:18:11.501 --> 00:18:13.800
they're committed treason.

307
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.910
I don't know much about the world,

308
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:20.610
but I believe if you did what they did here in Southeast Asia,

309
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:22.610
you get put to death one of those fucking countries.

310
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.923
<v 2>Uh,</v>

311
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.850
<v 1>who the fuck is the coach of the giants?</v>

312
00:18:27.851 --> 00:18:29.710
Did they get rid of that fucking fat guy?

313
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.050
That guy who looked like they just took him out of the fucking mezzanine level.

314
00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.813
<v 2>Uh,</v>

315
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.900
<v 1>wait a second.
Did they get rid of that guy?</v>

316
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.850
Giant's head coach.
All right,

317
00:18:46.851 --> 00:18:50.550
let's see.
Oh,
he is.
Uh,

318
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.450
why is it always go to Wikipedia?
No.

319
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.710
All right.
Wait a second,
Tom.
Further.

320
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.330
They had Bob Mcadoo,

321
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.350
Ben Mcadoo and they were like,

322
00:19:06.351 --> 00:19:11.120
Ben Macedon get the fuck Outta here.
Sorry.
Then Steve Spag or new low.

323
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

324
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.220
<v 1>Uh,
he was the interim coach.
Now they got pat show,</v>

325
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.900
but shoe,
it looks like a winner.
He would.
Oh,
they're fucking,

326
00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:25.010
I went to get a little bit older guy that keeps himself in shape,
you know?

327
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.463
<v 0>Okay.</v>

328
00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:33.470
<v 1>Now here he doesn't have fucking white hair.
I don't know who he was.</v>

329
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.120
I Dunno who the fucking guy was.
Anyways,
this is,

330
00:19:35.121 --> 00:19:37.790
can I get on with the podcast here?
Um,

331
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.450
I didn't do shit this week.
That was such a fucking weird weekend.

332
00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:44.540
I thought I was going to be on the road.
And then Mother Nature,

333
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:48.890
Cape fucking screaming in,
is that going to be another hurricane behind this one?

334
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.090
Over that parade of horrors last year they had like fucking 20,

335
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.380
20 hurricanes in a rob surprise feminists,
they'd get upset by that,
you know.

336
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

337
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.560
<v 3>To constantly named them by women's names in CG weight said we cause problems.</v>

338
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

339
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.670
<v 3>In men's lives.</v>

340
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.640
<v 1>Um,
I don't even know what to fucking say.
No,
I actually did a Gig the other day.</v>

341
00:20:13.641 --> 00:20:15.510
I did a,
a benefit Thursday night.

342
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.320
Last time I was on stage and uh,

343
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.680
you know,
I gotta be honest.
It was one of these,
you know,

344
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.010
they had like a red carpet and all this shit and I was just,

345
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:27.810
I saw some of the people,
I was like,
Oh man,

346
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:34.050
oh go fucking Bob on this one day there was the exact opposite.

347
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.590
That's like one of the hardest I've ever gone on stage and recent fucking memory

348
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:40.440
as far as like,
fuck it,
I'm going to say this fucking,
I'm going to say that.

349
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:44.310
And it went great and everybody was flipping out,
fucking enjoying it.
Laughing.

350
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.080
Bunch of women came up to me,

351
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:52.010
meaning for saying how funny they thought it was.
And I gotta be honest with you,

352
00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.930
I think the same way

353
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.490
the mass media misread this last election,

354
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:04.550
they are misreading where like people's idea of what is funny and what is it?

355
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.010
Because I was in Hollywood people,
liberal ground,

356
00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:13.620
fucking zero and all those jokes killed it.

357
00:21:13.621 --> 00:21:15.570
Everybody thought it was funny and I was sitting there,
you know,

358
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.330
after every other fucking yeah.
Was that the one that's got to get me in trouble?

359
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.070
It says the fucking gagged.
Take a dagger.
Am I going to have to fucking,
you know,

360
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.960
it's fucking unbelievable now.

361
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.760
Like you can't even have like an opinion.

362
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.730
That's what kills me is that that you did something.

363
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.600
If you just have an opinion that does not agree with them,

364
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:41.440
then all of a sudden you have to go on TV and you have to fucking apologize.

365
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.580
I,
I don't,
I don't know.
It's just,

366
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.520
I really feel that they're going to make a movie about this era and it's going

367
00:21:49.521 --> 00:21:52.690
to be like,
uh,
the red scare.

368
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.780
Like McCarthyism meets like fucking my space or something.

369
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.560
Who's going to be in it?
You know,
whether they should people consider are,

370
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.760
how many more innocent men are we going to let suffer?

371
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.140
Well,
not trying to say you can't say anything.
Oh my God.

372
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:14.740
What is this guy wearing?
He's wearing a fucking sports bra.

373
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.220
I am watching the Dallas cowboys right now,

374
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:23.221
and this guy just came out where in a fucking a half shirt slash sports bra.

375
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

376
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.820
<v 1>From the fucking 1980s.</v>

377
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.590
Did he steal that from one of the cheerleaders?

378
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.320
It's not even a half shirt.
He's,
it's a bra.
He's covering his,
his mail.

379
00:22:40.321 --> 00:22:42.220
Pictorials yeah.

380
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.233
<v 0>MMM.</v>

381
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.080
<v 1>There's Zubin weigh in or Zach Prescott.
Right.</v>

382
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.470
And then you know what's going to happen.
There's gotta be a bunch of people who,

383
00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:56.180
uh,
like to wear a male sports bras that are going to be offended.
It'd be like,

384
00:22:56.181 --> 00:23:00.530
why did you zoom in on his manly beard when you could have showed this other guy

385
00:23:00.531 --> 00:23:05.330
who's essentially dress like a spice girl?
Oh my God.

386
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.650
Ah,
God bless them.
I'd love to be that fucking ripped.

387
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.530
I don't know if there was ever a point in my life,

388
00:23:15.531 --> 00:23:19.370
I could fucking pull off what this guy's pulling off.
Holy fucking shit.

389
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.490
Oh my God.
God bless him.
God bless him.
Uh,

390
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.970
anyways,
I really am an old man.
I'm an old man now.
Christ,

391
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:33.470
what are these kids wearing?
You know,

392
00:23:33.471 --> 00:23:34.011
I actually,

393
00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:38.390
I should be in full support of this cause we wore have shirts in the 80s.

394
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.840
I never had the nerve to where one outside of the house.

395
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:44.723
<v 0>MMM.</v>

396
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.660
<v 1>You know,
I was just too pasty.
I never thought I had fucking abs enough to do it.</v>

397
00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:51.494
You know what I mean?

398
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.143
<v 2>And uh,</v>

399
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.531
<v 1>I didn't,
you know,</v>

400
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:58.940
a few things I never thought would come back half shirts and fucking Larry Bird

401
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:02.330
short shorts and they are back with the fucking vengeance.

402
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.423
<v 2>MMM.</v>

403
00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.730
<v 1>It really is.
Does anybody look worse than a fucking football helmet?</v>

404
00:24:08.731 --> 00:24:10.020
They need liability.
I mean,

405
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.580
he's first ballot hall of fame quarterback and first ballot hall of fame.
Like,

406
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.570
I don't know.
How much more does that guy have to win before you,
you,
you like,

407
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:20.010
<v 2>okay,</v>

408
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.560
<v 1>you can look at it wearing a helmet.
There's just something about it.</v>

409
00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:26.730
He looks like he's sitting between two fucking muscular people on a plane.

410
00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:30.240
He like,
he got the middle seat,
the shoulders or motion,
his face together.

411
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.293
<v 2>Uh,</v>

412
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.220
<v 1>I got a lot of balls considering the way I fucking look,
Huh?</v>

413
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:36.270
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.810
<v 1>Anyways.
Anyways,
I fucking ran out of batteries.</v>

415
00:24:40.811 --> 00:24:42.400
You wouldn't know because I just said anyways,

416
00:24:42.401 --> 00:24:46.990
cause it magically ended with me saying anyways,
but I did.
Yeah,
I just did.

417
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.320
I just said like another 10 minutes of the podcast after.
Okay.

418
00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.630
I was talking about Eli sitting between two muscular guys on a fucking plane and

419
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:55.970
uh,
I dunno,
you know,
I got to read these.
God Damn,

420
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.780
I'm going to read the fucking advertising against,
so know this.
All right.

421
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:02.690
This is my second.
I've already read these one time,

422
00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:07.160
so I should breeze through these.
I should breeze through these.

423
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.940
Um,
anyways,
my bookie.
Yeah,
that cricket.

424
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.800
There's a loud ass.
Fucking cricket was,

425
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.710
maybe that's the amount of people leaving the podcast at this point.

426
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:21.800
I have no idea.
My bookie,
uh,
you know,

427
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:24.980
ever since I started this podcast,

428
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:28.610
people have been asking for my advice.
Asked me,
you know,

429
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:32.630
ask me what team do I bet on?
The truth is,

Well I gotta be honest with you.

573
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:39.670
I respect farmers even though a big funny of what I've been farming country

574
00:33:39.671 --> 00:33:41.050
cause that's what I do.
What am I going to say?

575
00:33:41.051 --> 00:33:45.310
I respect farmers and get that douchey applause break.
You know,

576
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.310
like I'm some politician running for office.
Okay.

577
00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:51.270
And now next I'm going to say exactly what you want to hear.

578
00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.740
You know a lot my opponent.
So it sounds said that you guys are a,

579
00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:00.140
you guys are lazy,
but I'll tell you I have and it is going to be like,

580
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.830
fuck that guy.
No yellow tie.
Yeah.

581
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

582
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.130
<v 1>I bet air for the last three days and I don't think I've averagedly and anybody</v>

583
00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.160
wearing any yard or you April and every will lose their fucking mind with a dumb

584
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:15.680
fucking American flag hat.

585
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:17.343
<v 2>MMM.</v>

586
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:23.700
<v 1>Isn't it weird how dumb people are that actually show up to shit like that are,</v>

587
00:34:25.390 --> 00:34:26.830
you know,
I always noticed that.

588
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.833
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

589
00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.920
<v 1>Like what I was doing,
the opiate Anthony Show,
they had a bunch of people out,</v>

590
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:35.160
listeners that we're fucking smart.
But whenever you did a remote,

591
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.150
the fucking animals that showed up and it's the same fucking thing.

592
00:34:39.151 --> 00:34:42.610
Would politicians go on the road,
you know,

593
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.990
they're running for those primaries and stuff and you just look at the people in

594
00:34:45.991 --> 00:34:47.220
the fucking crowd,

595
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.693
<v 2>you know,</v>

596
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.900
<v 1>inherently they gotta be,
they,
we,
they don't have a fucking job.
Right.</v>

597
00:34:52.901 --> 00:34:53.740
What are they doing there?

598
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.060
Well maybe they're down there cause he needed a job and they believe in that

599
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:00.170
candidate.
Well,
yeah,

600
00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:04.760
I full just full fucking vote for on then the meantime,
go,

601
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:09.740
go fucking
hit the brakes and try to find a job.

602
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.440
Oh Bill,
what?

603
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:15.500
When are you going to stop over simplifying things and actually trying to read

604
00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:17.090
up on stuff?
I don't know.

605
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:18.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

606
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.710
<v 1>Wouldn't a lot of the charm or the podcast be gone if I did that,</v>

607
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.153
<v 2>you know,</v>

608
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.490
<v 1>is,
is it me or is the sound of that cricket?
Fucking definitely.</v>

609
00:35:30.491 --> 00:35:32.950
It's like it's in here.
It's like,

610
00:35:32.951 --> 00:35:36.910
it's slowly sneaking up on me to fucking,

611
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:43.000
you know,
is that the latest?
Uh Oh my God.

612
00:35:43.001 --> 00:35:46.570
Look at that.
Two young kids playing guitar.
Holy Shit.

613
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.120
Did they play the national anthem?
Oh thank God.
There's hope.

614
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.870
There's hope.
They keep playing a Gibson Les Paul,

615
00:35:55.871 --> 00:36:00.690
you spoiled God set up the phone.
It's going to save the fuck

616
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.580
the rich kid.
You know,
rich kid goes to the concerts.

617
00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.200
Like I liked that drum kit into the parents.
Go out and buy the exact one.

618
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:12.500
You know?
Does that kid ever make it?

619
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.433
<v 0>Okay?</v>

620
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.370
<v 1>Did you ever meet one rich kid that made it?</v>

621
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:24.000
Can you say Donald Trump made it?
You have to.
Even though he was rich,

622
00:36:24.001 --> 00:36:27.550
he turned the millions into billions and then he became the guy.
He,
he's,

623
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.940
he's fucking president of the United States.

624
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:33.690
No matter how much you hate the guy,
you got to admit he made it.

625
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.390
He is a fucking American success story.

626
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.460
Like if you were at the track,
okay.
And you,

627
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.860
if he was the odds,
what were the fucking odds?

628
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

629
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.490
<v 1>I can't imagine.
I can't imagine.</v>

630
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:53.100
I still cannot fucking believe that guy pulled that shit off.

631
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.233
<v 0>Yup.</v>

632
00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.430
<v 1>It's like watching Tom Brady throw for 500 yards of the super bowl is still</v>

633
00:37:00.431 --> 00:37:02.530
somehow losing.
Like how does that happen?

634
00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.690
All right.
So I've been under the weather the last couple of days,

635
00:37:07.691 --> 00:37:09.400
but I stayed on the,
uh,

636
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:15.760
I stayed on the Diet and uh,
oh,
do I have a fun,

637
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.940
I have a story but I can't tell it right now.
I have to wait.

638
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:24.150
I get wait like months from now where I feel like I can tell the fucking story.

639
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.780
But,
uh,
anyways,
I watched that boxing match,

640
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.740
you know,
that triple c guy where I don't know any,
I,

641
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.010
I've been away from boxing for so fucking long.

642
00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:41.440
I just got so fed up with how fucking corrupt it was just getting burned on

643
00:37:41.441 --> 00:37:44.230
paper views.
You know what I mean?

644
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.200
Like I really feel like Floyd Mayweather,

645
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:51.640
the people that I'm still won't give it up.

646
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.870
How great that guy is.

647
00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:57.871
Like it's just a fucking shame that that guy didn't fight packy out in the two

648
00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:00.820
thousands,
you know?

649
00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:04.450
And then we all got taken for a fucking ride when he did and now I'm seeing that

650
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:07.120
he's going to fight him again and

651
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.193
<v 0>okay.</v>

652
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.130
<v 1>Me Personally,
I think that guy's undeniably</v>

653
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.223
<v 0>okay.</v>

654
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.620
<v 1>What are the greatest of all time?
Without a fucking doubt.
I mean,</v>

655
00:38:14.621 --> 00:38:18.610
you can't argue that,
but I really think these,

656
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.140
these cash grabs,

657
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.090
<v 0>okay.</v>

658
00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.310
<v 1>I,
that just doesn't help me in.
Maybe it doesn't give a fuck.</v>

659
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.650
You know what I mean?
Fighting column and Gregor,

660
00:38:30.651 --> 00:38:35.030
and now you're going to fight like fucking packy how again,
I,

661
00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:40.200
but anyways,
but I,
I watched that fight.
Couple of fucking warriors.

662
00:38:40.201 --> 00:38:40.421
I don't,

663
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:43.440
I came in and went to a party and I saw like the last three rounds of it,

664
00:38:43.441 --> 00:38:45.090
I was like,
fuck,
I wish I saw this whole thing.

665
00:38:45.091 --> 00:38:48.780
But I remember [inaudible] was giving me shit because they like,
you know,
dude,

666
00:38:48.781 --> 00:38:52.110
I can't get into fuck MMA.
I really love boxing.

667
00:38:52.111 --> 00:38:55.860
Boxing is so much better and blah blah blah blah blah blah.

668
00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.510
And I have to admit a great fucking boxing match

669
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:06.810
is far as like combat sports.
I still,
you know what,
I have to agree.

670
00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:10.210
I don't think he can touch it
and we don't.

671
00:39:10.211 --> 00:39:13.890
What I like about it because I love MMA.
Fucking love the shit.
But like,

672
00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.660
like when you watch those like this stand up game in MMA,
it,

673
00:39:18.661 --> 00:39:22.290
you can't touch a boxer.
Now I know all you MMA guys going to flip out.
Yeah,

674
00:39:22.291 --> 00:39:24.450
you put a box on his back and he's done.
I understand that.

675
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.780
But it's the fact that all they do is throw punches.

676
00:39:27.781 --> 00:39:32.010
Like how fucking good they are.
Inboxing says credible.
Um,

677
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:33.291
like the,

678
00:39:33.291 --> 00:39:37.560
the level of skill and those guys were just in the center of the ring for the

679
00:39:37.561 --> 00:39:41.290
last three runs that I would watch.
It essentially just bagging,

680
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:44.820
just beating the shit out of each other.
And I know a lot of people did like the,

681
00:39:44.821 --> 00:39:45.654
uh,

682
00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:50.250
the decision and I always go to how corrupt fucking boxing is.

683
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.750
And the thing that I like about the UFC is despite the fact that it's sort of

684
00:39:54.751 --> 00:39:59.751
like apple where it's like this borderline monopoly and uh,

685
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.740
but they can at least,
you know,

686
00:40:01.741 --> 00:40:04.530
the best guys fight the best guys for the most part.

687
00:40:04.531 --> 00:40:06.990
I know it's not a perfect system,
but there's not like,
you know,

688
00:40:06.991 --> 00:40:08.920
three different leagues in,

689
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:12.120
somebody has to try to unify the title and all that Shit.

690
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

691
00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.720
<v 1>All right.
For some fucking reason I went to,
uh,</v>

692
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.520
I just hit stop against and I've got three fucking ones I got to edit together

693
00:40:20.521 --> 00:40:24.090
and such an idiot.
Um,
anyways,
so I was know,
fuck it.
I'll tell the story,

694
00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:28.300
but I'm not gonna name any names.
I was at this party,
um,
one of these

695
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.413
<v 0>like</v>

696
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.990
<v 1>really cool la parties that you hope you get invited to.</v>

697
00:40:32.991 --> 00:40:36.920
And I got invited to it and they had Cuban cigars there,

698
00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:40.340
which was fucking Incredibles,
a beautiful house,
beautiful house.

699
00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.760
And I went into the,
uh,

700
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.900
I went into this room with,
you know,
the TV room they had,

701
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.460
they had the boxing match on and I look over and a fucking,

702
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:56.840
one of the greatest boxers for when I was growing up was there.

703
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.810
And it was fucking hilarious because it was him.

704
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.400
And then just a bunch of regular people like me who didn't fight,
you know,

705
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.720
you know,
ever.
Oh whatever.
You know.

706
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.460
So he's sitting there,
so it was like you did want to comment,

707
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.930
you didn't want to say anything,

708
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:19.820
but you wanted to say something cause you want to show that you knew something.

709
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.480
It was fucking hilarious.
People would try it to be,
everybody was like,

710
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.290
you know,
wanting to say something,

711
00:41:27.291 --> 00:41:30.080
but then kind of like not one of those fucking hilarious.

712
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.640
So I didn't say anything.
I'm like,
I ain't saying fucking shit is no fucking way.

713
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:38.150
I'm going to be like,
oh,
throw left.
Fuck,
his heads are too low.

714
00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.330
Why?
Why set it up with the jab?

715
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:44.510
Like I'm going to fucking say that with this champions sitting there.
Right.

716
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.420
So my interaction was this t the,
at the end of the fight there was the decision.

717
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

718
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.290
<v 1>Then this really,
the greatest fighters of all time was just,
he went,
aw man,</v>

719
00:41:56.291 --> 00:41:59.140
come on.
And I just said,
no anyway.
No.

720
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.870
<v 5>And that was my interaction.
I left in Rome.
I was like,
all right,</v>

721
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.850
I got my interaction,

722
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.690
<v 1>but there was no fucking way.</v>

723
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.070
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

724
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.030
<v 5>there was no fucking way.
I just,
you know,</v>

725
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.900
I just watched the fight and was praying to God.
He would make some comments,

726
00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:20.510
which he did a couple times and it was just like,
oh my God,

727
00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:23.310
this is unbelief is unfucking believable.
Uh,

728
00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.210
don't ever let anybody have it shit on fucking la.

729
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:30.450
<v 1>I'm telling you,
you get out here,</v>

730
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:34.660
<v 5>bust your fucking ass.
And then I'm telling you,
the fucking people that you meet,</v>

731
00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:39.100
even if just for two seconds and you have a one word exchange,
it's like,

732
00:42:39.101 --> 00:42:40.150
you gotta be kidding me.

733
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:41.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

734
00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.950
<v 5>I remember a long time ago when I was,</v>

735
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:46.540
I was just struggling this business and I was on the fucking,
uh,

736
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.350
the Fox lot.

737
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

738
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.070
<v 5>And,
uh,</v>

739
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:52.050
<v 0>okay.</v>

740
00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:55.800
<v 5>I just bombed some audition and I was just like,
what am I doing out here?</v>

741
00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.090
I shouldn't be out here.

742
00:42:57.091 --> 00:42:59.450
I should be in New York trying to get better as a comedian.
That's just it.

743
00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.400
I just knew this wasn't my road.
So I was walking out,

744
00:43:02.401 --> 00:43:06.090
I was all fucking depressed.
And as I was walking across the lot,

745
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:09.540
fucking Henry Winkler,
this was like 20 years ago,

746
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.960
right around the time he was still the waterboy just k walking by.

747
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

748
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.280
<v 1>Yeah.
I was like,
that was fucking,
there was Henry fucking Winkler.</v>

749
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.600
I just got that.
That's how fucking cool is that I am somehow

750
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:27.990
was in his fucking life for like five seconds,

751
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.990
whatever I'm doing leads to meeting that guy

752
00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.960
and then like fucking,
I dunno,
20 years after that,

753
00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:39.340
<v 0>okay,</v>

754
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.190
<v 1>Bill Hader show Barry comes out.
Next thing you know,</v>

755
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:43.660
they want me to interview the cast.

756
00:43:43.661 --> 00:43:46.810
And I was fucking sitting there talking to Henry Winkler.
It really,

757
00:43:46.811 --> 00:43:51.040
it's an incredible place that probably won't be here.

758
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:57.280
Look,
there's global warming.
I don't know.
Who knows?
I'd say get Outta here now.

759
00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.420
Why you still can't,
you know,
go down to Miami.

760
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:03.790
Check these places.

761
00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:06.160
These places are going to be you going to be like somebody like,

762
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.080
you know when you're old at talking about how you,
you yeah.
Pawn pay.
I,

763
00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:13.600
I was there man.
Fuck yeah,

764
00:44:13.601 --> 00:44:17.020
I was there before the waters came up.
I was fucking there.

765
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.610
I did so blow.

766
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:23.380
I got my dick sucked and I had some fucking crab legs.

767
00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:30.380
So if you can say it like an old man [inaudible] watchos chic,

768
00:44:30.521 --> 00:44:31.354
right?

769
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.770
Whatever the fuck you say that like doing blow at that point would probably be

770
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:39.150
like,
you know,
bring it up,
doing the Watusi,
whatever the fuck that was.

771
00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

772
00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.420
<v 1>What was it like some sort of minor dance,
you know,</v>

773
00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.530
like what qualified is a fucking day like it is.
It amazing.

774
00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.530
Just sounds human beings progress creatively.

775
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:59.730
They're like the Charleston,
Charleston,
Charleston,
but I,
but a booboo.

776
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.090
Right?
And now like what?
What,

777
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.530
how well some of these kids can fucking dance just in clubs.

778
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.270
It's like back in the day,

779
00:45:08.271 --> 00:45:11.070
like Fred Astaire would be asking for a goddamn lesson.
Yeah.

780
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.490
It's like Odell Beckham

781
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.840
ever since he made that falling backwards while getting interfered with one

782
00:45:20.841 --> 00:45:25.430
handed,
like as far back as you can reach behind you had catch.

783
00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.200
Nobody ever made a catch like that now.
Like I don't know what they're doing.

784
00:45:30.201 --> 00:45:32.540
They're doing this thing where they're strengthening their fingers or they just

785
00:45:32.541 --> 00:45:36.050
practicing it.
Like the guy in the Jag was,
did it?

786
00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:37.810
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

787
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:38.680
<v 1>Like I watched that.</v>

788
00:45:38.681 --> 00:45:42.040
The only thing it was as though I can't say it was as good as Odell cause it,

789
00:45:42.041 --> 00:45:43.460
that was the first guy to do it.
Any end.

790
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.920
The big thing was he was getting interfered with while falling down backwards.

791
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.540
Um,
booze guy just,
he just reached out like those,
like Spiderman,

792
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.500
just snag the thing that moved it around so the defender could knock it out of

793
00:45:58.721 --> 00:46:00.940
his hand and like,
that's like a,

794
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:02.970
<v 0>okay,</v>

795
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.610
<v 1>that's sort of the joy I got him in.
It's like the Jordan effect.</v>

796
00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.920
Like that shit that you know Colby was doing like by the like they all saw

797
00:46:10.921 --> 00:46:14.670
Jordan do it and then they added it to their game cause he's showed the hey you

798
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:21.100
this is possible.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

799
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.390
I'm trying to say some deposit before I try and try and see how great la is and

800
00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:27.320
then the back of my head I'm like,
you know it's going to be fucking,

801
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.110
I don't know when it's going to be.

802
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.640
All I know is I got a weird feeling that it's going to be all green and it's

803
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.740
going to be raining like the fucking rain forest.

804
00:46:35.741 --> 00:46:37.670
You know they said that it's going to be like you get,

805
00:46:37.671 --> 00:46:39.290
it's going to be like weird weather.

806
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:41.150
I think it's going to be just everything is like whatever.

807
00:46:41.151 --> 00:46:44.330
It used to be like the east coast is going to get all fucking hot.

808
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.390
It's going to be a Goddamn desert and then out here is going to be like lush

809
00:46:47.391 --> 00:46:48.800
line.
I don't think it's going to be lush land.

810
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.710
That's just wishful fucking thinking.

811
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:55.370
I don't know who the fuck knows who the fuck are.

812
00:46:55.371 --> 00:46:58.010
They've always spent saying that we're going to fall into the goddamn motion at

813
00:46:58.011 --> 00:47:01.250
all.
That shit.
Did you guys watch any of that college football?

814
00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:05.720
What a fucking weekend.
You know what,
when I went out to go to that party,

815
00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.820
uh,
I could feel that our state Tcu game was getting was I,

816
00:47:09.821 --> 00:47:12.180
I knew I was leaving early and I had,

817
00:47:12.181 --> 00:47:15.380
so I think I missed the game of the year so far.
Um,

818
00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:21.530
and by the way,
uh,
Oh,

819
00:47:21.531 --> 00:47:24.660
before I get to move on to the next game,
Tcu,
by the way,
it,
how,

820
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.910
how quickly are they on their way to probation?
You know,

821
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.120
I don't get these guys.
These guys came out of nowhere.

822
00:47:31.121 --> 00:47:32.560
They were great and then they fell off,

823
00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:37.561
which you see now all of a sudden they're great again in a Texas and it's three

824
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:40.930
letters,
Tcu,
Smu,
I'm telling you there's something there.

825
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.150
I'm just fucking with you.
Tcu is what I fucking love.
Watching that team,
man.

826
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.680
Exciting is hell and uh,

827
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:51.040
almost had a great comeback against Ohio state.
Um,

828
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.180
and there are two at all while they're coaches suspended.

829
00:47:55.181 --> 00:47:59.650
He's allowed to coach during the fucking week,
but on,
on Saturdays,

830
00:47:59.651 --> 00:48:03.190
he is not allowed to coach.
Um,

831
00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:06.910
tell me you don't have some sort of headset wiring thing going on or some shit.

832
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:09.160
Um,
urban Meyer.

833
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

834
00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.920
<v 1>Uh,
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
That kid from north Texas who did the,
uh,</v>

835
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.450
the fake fair catch.

836
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:19.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

837
00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.100
<v 1>Uh,
the next time he calls for a fair catch,</v>

838
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:24.910
he better be waving a goddamn white flag because there's,

839
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.210
that dude is going to get stuck for the rest of the fucking year cause he,
he,

840
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.730
he humiliated whoever the fuck he did that too.

841
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:36.290
It would people see shit like that.
You lay a fucking deal with that to me.

842
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.460
Then they give you the hill right there Fred.
So keep your head on a swivel.

843
00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:44.630
This sunny.
Um,
I still don't understand how the fuck he pulled that off.

844
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:50.060
You know,
big time confidence.
Big Time.

845
00:48:50.061 --> 00:48:52.670
Fucking confidence.
Um,

846
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.870
did I read them from the almond farmer yet?
Did that?
I did I miss that one.

847
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.770
Did that one get cut off at all?
The fucking confusion here.

848
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

849
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.760
<v 1>This almond farmer wrote me,</v>

850
00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:11.600
he said he was actually listening to the podcast while I was talking about all

851
00:49:11.601 --> 00:49:15.960
almond farm.
Then he invited me,
you know,
to stop by,
which is always creepy,

852
00:49:15.961 --> 00:49:18.930
you know what I mean?
Those farmers is like,

853
00:49:18.931 --> 00:49:22.950
I love farm miles and now I'm fucking,
she had,
right.
But like,

854
00:49:22.951 --> 00:49:27.390
they're all scary looking far.
Mars is,
are there.
They're scary during the day

855
00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:32.220
because you never see anybody and he just always feel like they have all these,

856
00:49:32.221 --> 00:49:37.050
this,
this old fucking,
they have like sickles and shit and it's just,
you know,

857
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.880
they can feed to their pigs.
I Dunno.
They were shady group man.

858
00:49:41.881 --> 00:49:44.010
Those farmers,
they're out there by themselves.

859
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:47.280
You can't tell me you don't slowly go insane when you're fucking a phone when

860
00:49:47.281 --> 00:49:49.770
you were a farmer.
You know what I mean?
Then when you're fucking a farmer,

861
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.990
right ladies,
you keep doing that shit.
All right?
You don't have to be lonely.

862
00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:59.400
Play in with his fucking almond centered bulls.
All right,

863
00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:03.750
living off of smoothies.
Oh,
Lsu,
by the way,

864
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.740
Lsu is fucking two.
And now,
um,

865
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.420
I watched the whole game.
I watched the whole game and I watched so many sports,

866
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.530
so much sports this weekend.
I can't remember who the fuck they played.
Auburn.

867
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:20.100
Jesus Christ in Auburn,
right

868
00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.630
war.
Fucking Eagle,
right.

869
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:27.830
They went down there and they went down there and they fucking,

870
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:32.420
I don't know a lot of those Auburn people,
they're upset.
They lie on,
Hey,

871
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:37.421
what a warrant on him fucking passing or fairy girl scout book and calls.

872
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.650
Um,
I am a big proponent of quarterbacks and how much they get fucked over.

873
00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:46.880
But both of those were in interference.
If you were at the game,

874
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.530
that one over the middle looks like bullshit cause they didn't show you the full

875
00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:55.820
replay where the guy just held him for like,
you know,
10 yards.

876
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.940
Totally slowed them the fuck down.
And then the other one,

877
00:50:58.941 --> 00:51:02.840
that guy was grabbing his fucking arm,
you know,
it was borderline.

878
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:06.260
Sometimes she'd get away with it,
but he got caught.
But he was doing it.

879
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.630
I can tell you this,
uh,
we're fucking two window and what's his face there?

880
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:14.750
Their coach,
the hell's his goddamn name.

881
00:51:14.751 --> 00:51:19.190
I just keep spacing on his fucking name.
I'll get it.
Uh,
he's,

882
00:51:19.191 --> 00:51:20.840
he's the best thing in the SCC,

883
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:24.410
if not in the fucking college football right now.

884
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:30.830
Oh,
I tweeted that.
He's,
he,
he sounds like a fucking,
uh,

885
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.450
a Cajun Hulk.
Hogan.

886
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:34.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

887
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.470
<v 1>[inaudible] I'll tell you right now.
I'll tell you right now.</v>

888
00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:44.090
We went have to,
I'll drag you,

889
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.580
jump to what brother?
Uh,

890
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:50.200
he sounds like a fucking wrestler and he's got them believing in themselves and

891
00:51:50.201 --> 00:51:52.180
they got a quarterback.
This plan are right now,
and look,

892
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:56.770
we all know the Alabama Crimson tide is a fucking professional football team.

893
00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.770
All right?
I don't know what the Fuck Nick Saban is doing.

894
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:04.820
How we get to all those good guys.
Our,
we spoke,
I don't know what,

895
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.510
but that guy is the fucking guy,

896
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.600
Nick Saban.
I love rooting against them,
but I love that guy.
I love Nick Saban.

897
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.510
You know,
I love what he's done with the Alabama,
whatever.
But you know,

898
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:19.220
when I needed to pick a college team,

899
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.930
I wasn't going to fucking jump on the bandwagon.
You know,

900
00:52:23.931 --> 00:52:27.470
I like rooting against the fucking people.
You know what I mean?

901
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:34.030
Well Dahlia,
I dunno.
Maybe a doubt.
Um,
anyways,
plowing ahead,

902
00:52:34.031 --> 00:52:36.940
living off smoothies.
Hey Billy,
fish paste.

903
00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:39.250
Um,

904
00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.820
last week you mentioned you'd love to just live off smoothies if you could.

905
00:52:43.821 --> 00:52:45.290
Well it turns out you can,

906
00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:50.650
there's an entire niche food market called meal replacements or complete foods

907
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:53.930
that contain all the carbs,
fats,
proteins,
fibers,

908
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:57.890
micro nutrients and everything else.
The body needs to function properly.

909
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.640
All in one serving.
Yeah,
I know,
but I get nervous cause when I,

910
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:03.070
I just feel like that it's,

911
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:06.830
it's science and then they always put all these fucking chemicals and shit in

912
00:53:06.831 --> 00:53:11.230
there.
Yeah,
some common powder form.
So all you do is mix it with water.

913
00:53:11.231 --> 00:53:12.940
Others come ready to drink in the bottle.

914
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:16.810
The difference between them and something shitty like ensure is that they take

915
00:53:16.811 --> 00:53:21.760
human biology and complete nutritional needs into account and make sure you get

916
00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:25.910
the full recommended daily intake for all vitamins,
minerals,
and macros.

917
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:30.080
<v 5>Eh,
also most of them are made from whole food ingredients.</v>

918
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.170
This is probably what the future's going to be like when we fucking destroy the

919
00:53:33.171 --> 00:53:34.004
whole planet.

920
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.300
And the only people left are living in this giant air conditioned fucking

921
00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:42.760
greenhouse.
Uh,
and they just in there with,

922
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:46.190
I don't Dunno what chemicals,
but eventually you need plants so that they just,

923
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:50.570
they kept their own ecosystem and like we're going to heal the earth from inside

924
00:53:50.571 --> 00:53:54.860
here and then it's going to work on the way out.
There's another side.

925
00:53:54.861 --> 00:53:57.860
I always pitched these Scifi movies,
you know,

926
00:53:57.861 --> 00:54:01.730
and then years later they ended up making them like that fucking population

927
00:54:01.731 --> 00:54:06.020
jumped that I did that.
You take a test,
they literally made that fucking movie.

928
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:10.070
Where's another one for you?
You even can't actually go ahead and make it,

929
00:54:10.071 --> 00:54:14.750
cause I'm not gonna fucking do it.
Did you just give consent?
Um,

930
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.450
here's one for you,
right?

931
00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:23.350
The whole fucking world looks like a Goddamn desert does all waterworld desert

932
00:54:23.351 --> 00:54:24.184
and all that shit.

933
00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:29.460
And it's just this one fucking house,

934
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:33.340
giant fucking greenhouse to size of Dallas cowboys stadium.

935
00:54:33.341 --> 00:54:37.490
And in there they actually have plants,
they've got some chickens and shit.

936
00:54:37.491 --> 00:54:40.450
It's like a fucking art that doesn't go anywhere.
Right?

937
00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:44.910
And in there is the perfect fucking ecosystem.
All right.

938
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:48.630
And then they're going to gradually,
like their thing is,

939
00:54:48.631 --> 00:54:53.631
is if they have to weight out all the waste and hope that the planet comes back

940
00:54:54.641 --> 00:54:55.750
and then they gradually,

941
00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:01.020
every year they try to expand a little bit more of this stadium to fucking

942
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:07.720
include more.
The more the culinary claim claymore,
the fucking scorched earth.

943
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:10.900
Right.
I'm already off the rails.
I don't know if this fucking works,

944
00:55:10.901 --> 00:55:15.100
but somehow there's a fucking guy in there and he wants to take control and it's

945
00:55:15.101 --> 00:55:19.360
all about the fucking air conditioner.
Right?
That was a bad one.

946
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:22.870
But some of the one of you nerds can figure it out.
Right.
All right.
Anyways,

947
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.630
the one that first came online a few years ago was called,

948
00:55:25.631 --> 00:55:28.600
this is back to the living off smooth smoothies.
Soylent,

949
00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.750
they make potter and premixed drinks.
Very tasty.

950
00:55:31.751 --> 00:55:34.870
But this doesn't have other companies that make similar products.
You know,

951
00:55:34.871 --> 00:55:37.660
one of the guys I fly with,
uh,
you know,

952
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:42.970
his digestive system or whatever,
that's all he does.
And he,
we flew back from uh,

953
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.550
this place one time and I was hungry.
It was drink this man,
you'll be full.

954
00:55:47.551 --> 00:55:50.560
And I drank it and it felt good but it was,
it was too weird.
I need to,

955
00:55:50.561 --> 00:55:54.940
I would need to read up on it.
Uh,
but I know I'm not going to,

956
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:59.360
so I'm going to stick with what I've been doing.
Put a,
but I,

957
00:55:59.361 --> 00:56:01.910
I would think that you'd be in great shape.
Right.

958
00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:06.740
You know,
it's nice and easy to digest the food.
I don't know.

959
00:56:06.741 --> 00:56:09.490
It depends on what's in it though.
Right?
Anyways,

960
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:14.040
it doesn't have other companies that make similar products like Hule he'll be

961
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:17.000
happy.
He will h u e l,
Jimmy Joy,

962
00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.730
bio lint and super body fuel,

963
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:24.460
all with their very own special take on how to fulfill dietary requirements.

964
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:28.270
It's been working for me for years and I even lived off soylent for a month

965
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:31.660
straight a couple of years ago with no issues along with hundreds of other

966
00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:34.090
people.
But you obviously don't have to do that.

967
00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:36.910
You could just use it for breakfast or whatever you want.

968
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.430
Thanks for all your laughs and go fuck yourself.
Well,
let me,

969
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.770
did you lose a bunch of weight and shit?

970
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:46.430
Like why don't fat people just fucking do this or look into it?

971
00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:48.733
You know,

972
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:52.910
cause I figured that once they push through and get off the sugar salt,

973
00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.430
they can start turning it around.
Um,

974
00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:59.940
and one of the hardest things to do about eating healthy is now you got to sit

975
00:56:59.941 --> 00:57:03.840
there and prepare the shit while you're super hungry and your body's going fuck

976
00:57:03.841 --> 00:57:06.030
this order a pizza man,
order a fucking pizza.

977
00:57:06.031 --> 00:57:08.160
But if they'd just all these containers ready to go,

978
00:57:08.161 --> 00:57:12.430
you just shake it up and you'd drink it.
Um,
that could actually help some people.

979
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.220
But I,
I would definitely,
if you're going to do that,
if you listened to,

980
00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:16.041
so you're thinking of doing that,

981
00:57:16.041 --> 00:57:20.080
I would definitely do some research as far as like what is in them.
All right.

982
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:24.550
Boycott dear Billy boycott,
how do you feel about boycotting?

983
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.740
Have you ever boycotted anything?
Uh,
yes,
I have.
I have.
Uh,

984
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.800
is there any reason you would boycott a show podcasts your company because you

985
00:57:32.801 --> 00:57:36.880
didn't agree with their behavior?
Um,

986
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.090
no.
Are Not their opinions.

987
00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:41.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

988
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:46.340
<v 5>I would,
I would,
I would like,
uh,
if something sucked.</v>

989
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.960
So I guess that's not a boycott then.
All right.
Anyways,
he goes,

990
00:57:50.961 --> 00:57:53.570
I feel like you have a thick skin,
so you'd probably have only,

991
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.160
he probably only have reason to boycott a group that was censoring you are your

992
00:57:58.161 --> 00:58:01.030
comedy.
Um,

993
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.400
yeah.
What?
I boycott something

994
00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:13.770
when I boycott a company because of their behavior.
Well,
I hate bankers,

995
00:58:13.771 --> 00:58:17.400
but I still fucking use them.
So that goes that.

996
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.410
Um,

997
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.680
yeah,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I respect people.
If that's what they want to fucking do,

998
00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.280
I would put it that way,
but like,

999
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.640
<v 0>okay,</v>

1000
00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.650
<v 5>I don't know that I would,
uh,</v>

1001
00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:38.640
I,
you know,
I get why people do that shit.

1002
00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:45.900
You just have to do a lot to fucking lose me,
I think,
you know what I mean?

1003
00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.970
Mike,
I hung in there with Trump and you know,

1004
00:58:49.971 --> 00:58:52.580
cause I root for the president whether I like them or not,

1005
00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:55.820
but like once his wife wore that,
yeah,
I don't really care.

1006
00:58:55.821 --> 00:58:59.580
Do you jacket to that fucking,
you know,

1007
00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.460
when she was going down to see kids that were taken away from their parents.

1008
00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:03.323
I mean,

1009
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.590
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1010
00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:06.750
<v 5>whether they're right or wrong about their way,</v>

1011
00:59:06.751 --> 00:59:11.340
their handling immigration or how they want to enforce it,
that,
you know,

1012
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.550
that goes out the window when there's some kid crying missing his parents and

1013
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:17.340
he's,
he or she's scared,
you know,
and you're going to wear something like that.

1014
00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:21.060
That's when they lost me and I was just like,
all right,
bye.

1015
00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.600
Don't trash room in my act.
You know,

1016
00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:25.510
God knows his fucking plenty of people doing that.
Um,

1017
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:31.000
so I may be honest with,
at this point in history,

1018
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:34.630
I think it's really important rather than to walk away or something like that.

1019
00:59:34.631 --> 00:59:39.631
It's more important to try to get something going to talk or something cause

1020
00:59:39.671 --> 00:59:41.380
this screaming and yelling shit.
Jesus,

1021
00:59:41.381 --> 00:59:45.100
this is come from somebody who's a fucking screaming cunt.
Um,

1022
00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:49.500
yeah.
It just,
it doesn't,
uh,
it doesn't fucking,

1023
00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:54.150
it doesn't make any sense.
I understand why people do what they get.

1024
00:59:54.151 --> 00:59:57.900
They get emotional.
Jesus Christ.
God knows I got fucking emotional today.

1025
00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.050
Sky was supposed to move some fucking furniture in my house.

1026
01:00:01.051 --> 01:00:03.360
It's one of the fucking work.
And she's like,
I,
you know,

1027
01:00:03.361 --> 01:00:07.890
I did all this work on the house and like I love the house as much as I bitch

1028
01:00:07.891 --> 01:00:09.360
about it.
And you know,

1029
01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:14.220
I brought it back to life where a lot of people did some home depot bullshit to

1030
01:00:14.221 --> 01:00:18.300
it and I tried to restore it,
you know,
update it in the walls,

1031
01:00:18.301 --> 01:00:22.470
but like outside it tried to make it look like,
um,
you know,

1032
01:00:22.471 --> 01:00:24.720
the time when it was created,
it was,
you know,

1033
01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:29.400
so I went and I got these vintage door handles and somebody swiped one of them

1034
01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.840
and I swear to fuck I got it back though.
I got it.

1035
01:00:33.841 --> 01:00:35.850
I raised fucking holy health.

1036
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:38.670
It's one of the few times my wife didn't give me shit for losing my mind.

1037
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.090
I fucking lost my fucking mind.

1038
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:47.970
What is that about when somebody steals from you?
You know,

1039
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:51.420
it's just that they,
it's like,
I think,
who the fuck do you,

1040
01:00:51.421 --> 01:00:53.820
do you think I'm that fucking stupid?
I wasn't going to notice.

1041
01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:55.710
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1042
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:57.000
<v 5>Do you think I'm the kind of person that's,</v>

1043
01:00:57.001 --> 01:01:00.660
that's not going to fucking pursue this?
Like I,
I used to Jesus Christ.

1044
01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:06.920
Oh well there's a reason I don't fucking own a firearm.
You know,

1045
01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:07.471
you can't,
you know,

1046
01:01:07.471 --> 01:01:10.020
so that's one of those things that they should do is they stage when you go down

1047
01:01:10.021 --> 01:01:13.560
and get a fucking a gun license.

1048
01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:16.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1049
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:19.250
<v 5>They should like spy on you for a week and just figuring out what irritates you</v>

1050
01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:20.660
and then they just come in and do it.

1051
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.880
Just have somebody do it to you in the parking lot.

1052
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:25.880
Just see how much you lose your shit and just see if you should have a fucking

1053
01:01:25.881 --> 01:01:30.020
gun or not.
Um,
I would never shoot anybody,

1054
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:32.810
but I think I would definitely brandish a weapon.

1055
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.550
I'm fucking wave at somebody face,
buddy.

1056
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:40.550
I am going to shoot you in the face.

1057
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:42.950
You don't put your fucking hands on that dashboard.

1058
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.760
One of those underrated performances in any territory to movie the Guy who

1059
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:51.410
played that fucking cup.
Um,
in the bathroom scene.
All right.

1060
01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:56.220
Buying a Lamborghini.
Hey Billy,
the financial advisor

1061
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.350
just might be my favorite fucking question.

1062
01:02:00.351 --> 01:02:02.450
Never are you going to buy a Lamborghini?

1063
01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:06.410
You ever just live vicariously through somebody?
I'm more of a Ferrari guy,

1064
01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:11.050
but God bless you.
You know,
I'm not a Lamborghini.
Guys are more flashy.
A,

1065
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.630
hey Billy,
the financial adviser.
I,
I'd appreciate your take.

1066
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.320
My childhood dream has been to own a Lamborghini.
Thank God.
Damn it.

1067
01:02:18.321 --> 01:02:20.370
Get yourself one.
Not because of the,

1068
01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.360
he says I'd attract,

1069
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.150
but because I am a huge interest in cars and they've always been a motivation

1070
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:31.170
for me.
A problem is I'm not a hundred percent sure if I should.

1071
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:36.540
I should.
I he left a word out,
drop 250 grand on a car.

1072
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:41.160
I know the old saying,
if you have to ask,
uh,
you can't afford it.

1073
01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.440
Uh,
has truth to it.
But I'd like to get advice from people on a big decision.

1074
01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.400
We'll do it.
I'm not the guy.
I'm currently 27,
he says,

1075
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:53.820
did my master's and work a commission based job,
a realtor.

1076
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.950
And luckily he had a few good years in the past.
Um,
from the money I saved,

1077
01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:03.060
I managed to buy three investment properties.
Oh Dude,
you're,
you're,
you're,
yes.

1078
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.390
Okay.
This is all great stuff.

1079
01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.960
I know technically they belong to the bank,

1080
01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:12.030
but I've been able to build equity that way.

1081
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.240
The shitty thing is because I've been buying these,

1082
01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.120
I ended up not buying a place for myself.

1083
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:21.150
My parents had been nice enough to let me stay home with them.

1084
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.790
I know that this is kind of fucked up,

1085
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:27.930
but I'm from South Africa and it's frowned upon to move out before getting

1086
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:29.700
married,
but to just saving a ton of money.

1087
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:34.620
So I guess I kind of took advantage of that.
No,
you didn't,
that,

1088
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:39.360
that was their rule and you'd just,
you're playing within the rules anyways.

1089
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:44.040
Also,
you tell him a patriots fan as the wrong that they didn't say can't do it.

1090
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.760
Also,
I don't have a girlfriend and actually don't get laid at all,

1091
01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:50.910
so I'm not doing it to impress girl.
I could give a fuck about them.

1092
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:56.370
You are just a fucking asexual moneymaking machine here,
sir.
My question is,

1093
01:03:56.371 --> 01:03:58.500
should I buy my own place first,

1094
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:03.330
then save up for a lambo or fulfill my childhood dream?
Now,
uh,

1095
01:04:03.331 --> 01:04:07.050
the reason I don't want to necessarily buy a places because then I'll have a lot

1096
01:04:07.051 --> 01:04:12.051
of pressure to find a wife and I know no woman will ever let me spend 250 grand

1097
01:04:12.511 --> 01:04:17.511
on a car and let's say spent 250 grand on her and because it made the lay my

1098
01:04:18.481 --> 01:04:22.140
dream and other five or so years and I want to enjoy it while I'm still

1099
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:25.350
relatively young.
All right.
Wow.

1100
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.700
This guy's really planning out his life.
I liked this also.
That matters.

1101
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:34.830
I have about half of the amount I need saved up so far and will either save up

1102
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:36.870
for another six months to a year and yes,

1103
01:04:36.871 --> 01:04:40.770
I researched maintenance costs and if factored those into its guy's done his

1104
01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:43.050
homework and he help would be appreciated.

1105
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:47.730
Thanks for the free podcasts and any advice from Nia would be helpful to you

1106
01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:51.390
guys are great together and I wish I had friends in real life like you guys.

1107
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:55.020
That's really nice.
Now that I'm done sucking your tick.
Thanks.

1108
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:58.980
And Go fuck yourself.
That's hilarious.
Um,
all right,

1109
01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:02.490
well I think you know more about money than I do.
Um,

1110
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.090
here's the pros to buy a Lamborghini.
Um,

1111
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.710
they do retain their value.
Okay?

1112
01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:15.711
If you don't wrap it around a fucking tree or modify it or do a bunch of,

1113
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:20.130
you know,
put a bunch miles on it.
The weird thing about a Lamborghini is that,

1114
01:05:20.131 --> 01:05:20.964
you know,

1115
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:25.260
these fucking guys get them and then they have him for 20 years and they sell

1116
01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:27.870
them and they always have like 800 original miles.
And it's like,

1117
01:05:27.871 --> 01:05:32.220
why the fuck did you even have it?
Uh,
secondly,

1118
01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.060
um,
I don't know if it helps you.
It's not a good look.

1119
01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.780
If your real estate agent is 27 and pulls up in a fucking Lamborghini,

1120
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:43.020
that would make me feel like this guy's taken way too much commission.

1121
01:05:43.021 --> 01:05:46.320
He's fucking me.
So I,
if you're going to get it,
I would not drive it to work.

1122
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:48.330
Um,

1123
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:51.283
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1124
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:55.100
<v 5>And as far as your worry about women,
uh,
here's,</v>

1125
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:59.150
here's the secret with women is you gotta be up front with them,

1126
01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.003
okay?

1127
01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.510
You have to tell them from fucking day one that this is what you're doing and

1128
01:06:05.511 --> 01:06:07.460
then you have to follow through and do it.

1129
01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:11.440
And don't let them do that shit where they go.
Well,
that was the,

1130
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:15.770
I was pregnant.
Nope.
Nope,
nope.

1131
01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:20.900
All right.
Um,
I,
I would lean,
I would,

1132
01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.610
uh,
listen,
I think there's,

1133
01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:27.410
there's a massive like bubble being built it,
and I don't know shit,

1134
01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:31.730
so people don't listen to me.
Okay.
I know I'm a bald guy and I know I screen,

1135
01:06:31.731 --> 01:06:34.010
but I'm not that guy on TV who yells about the stocks.

1136
01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.630
I'm just a fucking stupid comedian.
Okay.
And I go with my gut and my gut is,

1137
01:06:38.631 --> 01:06:42.230
was a travel round the country up.
Fucking look.
A paypal.
All right?

1138
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:45.800
And what's been freaking me out is the shit that I'm talking about where,
uh,

1139
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.990
it's like a fucking Thursday afternoon.

1140
01:06:47.991 --> 01:06:51.230
I'm on the road and I go to a breakfast place and it is fucking packed.

1141
01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.440
I'm standing in line like it's Sunday after church and I'm just looking around

1142
01:06:56.691 --> 01:06:59.150
going,
don't any of these fucking people have a fucking job.

1143
01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.300
And I'm looking at them all and they all have smart phones and they have fucking

1144
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:07.410
iPads and they got fucking their custom fucking sneakers that they ordered and

1145
01:07:07.431 --> 01:07:10.630
everybody is living this fucking lifestyle and part of his lifestyle is,

1146
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.070
and building all these fucking luxury high rise apartments.
I mean this,

1147
01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:17.980
this is my fifth time around the block,
but this shit all right.

1148
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:20.810
Started with the fucking yuppies was the first time I saw it.

1149
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:25.810
The fucking Dotcom Shit.
Uh,
the,
the,
the housing bubble la,

1150
01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.710
everybody's getting a house,
you know,

1151
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:31.940
I'm fucking 10 years ago and now this shit,

1152
01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:36.050
so maybe it's my fourth time through this,
but this is,
this is what happens.
So,

1153
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.513
um,

1154
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:43.690
I think keep doing what you're doing with the money and either stay at home,

1155
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.640
I wouldn't buy,
I wouldn't buy the loan or I want to,
I don't want to talk to you.

1156
01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:51.740
It's a fucking dreaming or so I,
I'm,
there's no way I'm going to talk a guide up,

1157
01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.120
a stream or a woman or a hermaphrodite or somebody transitioning.

1158
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.850
Did I cover everybody?
Am I still in show business?
Um,

1159
01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:07.060
I,
uh,
and then as far as the pressure,
you're going to get to get married,
uh,

1160
01:08:07.061 --> 01:08:10.540
fuck that.
Okay.
At some point you gotta be like,
listen,
I'm not doing that.
Okay.

1161
01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:14.200
I'm going to get married when I find the right person.
Okay.

1162
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:18.770
If you don't what I'm talking about just watched coming to America.
Okay.

1163
01:08:18.771 --> 01:08:20.960
I think you're gonna find a lot of themes that you can relate to.

1164
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.510
Um,
that's your,
my coming to America is kill the Irishmen.
Um,
anyways.

1165
01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:30.643
Uh,

1166
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:31.950
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1167
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:33.450
<v 5>Yeah.
I think,
you know,</v>

1168
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.880
here's the thing is another way to have a Lamborghini.

1169
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.240
You could have a Lamborghini for like a year and then turn around and sell it.

1170
01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.290
You know,
my only thing is,
is I think I,

1171
01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:49.291
I would kind of wait until the fucking Lamborghini is a great thing to buy

1172
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:53.910
during a recession.
Okay.
Unless you're talking about buying a new one,

1173
01:08:53.911 --> 01:08:58.620
then you know,
but,
um,
I mean,
you're,
you're,

1174
01:08:58.621 --> 01:09:01.170
you're always going to be able to sell a fucking Lamborghini.

1175
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.110
And I've never seen,
um,
well,
you know,

1176
01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:10.330
let's fucking look them up.
By the way,
I fucking love this team.

1177
01:09:10.331 --> 01:09:12.640
I love anybody with a fucking dream in this guy.

1178
01:09:12.641 --> 01:09:15.120
Like he wants a fucking Lamborghini and God dammit,

1179
01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:16.540
he's going to figure out how to do it.

1180
01:09:16.541 --> 01:09:20.470
I love this Lamborghini,

1181
01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:25.140
uh,
used for sale.
All right,

1182
01:09:25.141 --> 01:09:29.490

Let's see what we got to use.

900 909 c,

1185
01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:40.050
this is why you don't listen to me.

1186
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.250
Is that the poster?
Is that the actual fucking car?
Are you serious?

1187
01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.550
Oh,
that's a kit.

It's not a real one.

1188
01:09:56.390 --> 01:10:00.200
Use Lamborghini.

1195
01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:37.440

You can get for two oh nine five 82 door coupe.

1197

Then you can get a 2018 Volvo s 90 for $375 a month.

1198
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:52.540
What?
Who the fuck is looking at this as well?
Maybe I'd like a Volvo.

1199
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.190
Um,

1200
01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:55.700
<v 0>okay.</v>

1201

<v 5>Use 2008 Lamborghini Murcia,
Lego revention coop.</v>

1202
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:04.550
For some reason they want 1,000,008 and 18 what?
No fucking way.

1203
01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:10.110
There's another or there's another all those door.
All those who,
the kitty ones.

1204
01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:15.400
These are the big boys here.

Evan Taito,

1205
01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:18.010
LP seven 54 soup.

1206
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:20.620
Super vellows roadster.

1207
01:11:20.621 --> 01:11:25.621
I know it says 659,009 $900 these are a year old and these are all like a half a

1208
01:11:29.441 --> 01:11:32.260
million bucks,
right?
MMM.

1209
01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.550
Yeah.
Dude.
You don't want to spend all this fucking mom.

1210
01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.540
Maybe you don't worry though.
I would,
I would buy a used one though.

1211
01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:44.200
I would definitely buy a fucking use one.
Holy Shit.

1212
01:11:44.201 --> 01:11:45.930
He knew what kills me about these things.
If you go to,

1213
01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.310
when you go to the supermarket and drive over a fucking speed bump,

1214
01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.760
please tell me though,
sir,
if you get this thing,
please take it to the track.

1215
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.460
Please take it to the track.
Could you please,

1216
01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:55.870
could you please take it to the track?

1217
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.390
He might've Lamborghini's and never go to the fucking track.

1218
01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.000
You know that if I got one of those fucking things,

1219
01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:02.560
I'd have it on a flatbed truck.

1220
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:06.040
I'd take it to the track and I would meet an instructor there and be like,

1221
01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:10.390
teach me to drive this thing as fast as my skill set will allow me,
um,

1222
01:12:10.391 --> 01:12:14.110
without fucking destroying it.
All right,
let's close on this dilemma,

1223
01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:19.060
but good luck to you,
sir.
Uh,
you got a lot of great options.
Okay?
Okay.
Uh,

1224
01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.760
tell the woman what you're going to do and stick with it.

1225
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:26.620
What are you going to do?
Beat you up,
you know?
Um,
and then secondly,

1226
01:12:26.621 --> 01:12:28.690
you got to let go of that shit with your parents.
If you're going,
don't,

1227
01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:31.260
don't not buy a house because of some fucking,
you know,

1228
01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:34.810
pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
Sorry,

1229
01:12:34.811 --> 01:12:38.800
I always have to go with the fucking some sort of where I'm from kind of thing

1230
01:12:38.801 --> 01:12:42.790
here.
A dilemma.
Everybody.
Dear Bill,

1231
01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.770
if your life depended on it,

1232
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.520
would you and Chris Burma's voice what?

1233
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.930
Rat live in medieval times as a king.

1234
01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.100
What makes 65 grand a year in the present time?

1235
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.840
Oh fuck that.
Oh my God.
As a king,
you be able to fuck any you wanted.

1236
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:07.670
Eat well live well do king shit.

1237
01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.590
But you'd have to worry about being overthrown or invaded.
Yeah,

1238
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:14.600
we're hitting some fucking disease and yeah,
and smallpox.

1239
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:16.130
Everyone asks this question.

1240
01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:21.560
Two changes their mind after talking it out.
I know.
I right out of the gate,

1241
01:13:21.561 --> 01:13:22.520
I was like,
no brainer.

1242
01:13:22.521 --> 01:13:27.521
I'll take 65 grand a year in the NFL package and I'll be an absolute fucking

1243
01:13:27.981 --> 01:13:28.814
nobody.

1244
01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.960
I'll rub it out to internet porn before I would go back into medieval fucking

1245
01:13:35.271 --> 01:13:38.360
times was scurvy gang green.

1246
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:41.300
The Blackpool scurvy I wouldn't have because I'd be a king,

1247
01:13:41.301 --> 01:13:44.630
I'd have plenty of fucking vitamin C.
Right?
Is that what it is?
No.
Vitamin C,

1248
01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.020
no fruit in your diet or some shit.
Um,

1249
01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:51.490
yeah,
fuck all that.

1250
01:13:51.491 --> 01:13:55.210
And then everybody come in to try to fucking kill me and then just then the shit

1251
01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:56.950
I would have to do to stay in power,

1252
01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.940
putting people in iron maidens and stretching them out.
I'm like,

1253
01:14:00.941 --> 01:14:05.080
I don't want to hurt people.
You know?
And then if you're a cool king,
right?

1254
01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.570
I mean,
Jesus Christ,
they be call your fucking Lord snowflake.

1255
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.060
They would all these liberal fucking,

1256
01:14:10.061 --> 01:14:13.580
everybody would think that they could get over on you.
Right.

1257
01:14:13.581 --> 01:14:16.400
And then you just have to stick someone in the belly of the beast.
You know,

1258
01:14:16.401 --> 01:14:21.170
I think about that fucking all the time.
I meant like out of all those things,

1259
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.360
the iron maiden,
they slam it shut.
You're dead.

1260
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:26.240
You know the rack is fucking brutal.
You know,
the rack,
they actually,

1261
01:14:26.241 --> 01:14:30.170
they thought it stretched in,
broke you,
you're a Toyota tendons and stuff.

1262
01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:34.100
When it actually did was it broke your bones by stretching to the point that

1263
01:14:34.101 --> 01:14:37.670
they cracked at me.
Just fucking insane.

1264
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:40.610
Human beings are so fucking horrible.
It's,
it's,

1265
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:44.780
it's not even like a eeky came,
you can't wrap your head around it,

1266
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:47.180
but the belly of the beast,
you know,

1267
01:14:47.181 --> 01:14:48.920
that expression being in the belly of the beast,

1268
01:14:48.921 --> 01:14:51.380
they would actually have like some giant looking bolusing

1269
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.610
made out of cast iron or something and they would put you in there,

1270
01:14:55.611 --> 01:14:59.030
close it and then light of fire underneath and basically cookie will live.

1271
01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.870
And the amount of times I thought of what I would do

1272
01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:07.460
if I was in there,
I would just slam my fucking head.

1273
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:12.070
I would fuck I do the million dollar baby.

1274
01:15:12.071 --> 01:15:15.100
I would bite through my fucking time but it,
but to actually fucking,
you know,

1275
01:15:15.101 --> 01:15:19.500
hot,
it'd have to be before I could actually have the balls to do that.
Um,

1276
01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:24.410
is there a way to just like,
you know,
you just rip your own throat out?
I would,

1277
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:28.150
I would literally,
I would try to fucking punctured my neck and bleed out.

1278
01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.300
That's what I would try to do.
Um,

1279
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.050
but they probably put you in the butt ass naked with your phone all tied up and

1280
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:38.470
shit.
I mean,
just fucking brutal.
So it's not even a question dude.

1281
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:42.970
65 grand a fucking year in the present.

1282
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.680
You know,
my dress like Albert Einstein,

1283
01:15:45.681 --> 01:15:50.350
same fucking clothes every day except would be more the Malcolm young wardrobe,

1284
01:15:50.351 --> 01:15:52.340
rest his soul.
Do you know,
I've been,
you know,

1285
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:57.130
going through a lot of shit here and I actually found this Malcolm Young,

1286
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:02.260
uh,
like action figure thing that I have not action figure.

1287
01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.240
It's like e but I bought the thing,

1288
01:16:04.241 --> 01:16:08.620
I never assembled it cause you had to came from somewhere in Asia.
So,
you know,

1289
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:12.220
Angus didn't get any money on it and you fucking,
uh,

1290
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:17.210
you got to Gulu his feet to the fucking base.
Uh,

1291
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:20.620
I've been meaning to go over to one of these fucking mom and pop department

1292
01:16:20.621 --> 01:16:24.910
stores,
you know,
Fuck Home Depot.
I mean anytime,

1293
01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.480
like you want to talk about someone who gets to act like a king over there,

1294
01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:29.320
she can actually find somebody on the floor.
They can,

1295
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.450
that doesn't have 20 people like running after them.
You know,

1296
01:16:34.451 --> 01:16:37.120
like when a dog whisperer goes over the hill and he's got $20,

1297
01:16:37.121 --> 01:16:40.290
about 20 kids behind them or dogs behind them.
That's what the fuck.

1298
01:16:40.291 --> 01:16:43.750
And Home Depot is like.
So anyways,
yeah,
I would take 65.
We're in a year.

1299
01:16:43.751 --> 01:16:47.040
Great question though.
Great question.
A great.
Um,

1300
01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:53.080
I hope that guy,
I,
it's going to work out for you buddy.
All right.
If you want,

1301
01:16:53.081 --> 01:16:55.900
you got to tell somebody first dates.
Tell me about yourself.
Uh,

1302
01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:00.250
I've always wanted a Lamborghini,
you know,
Jesus.

1303
01:17:00.251 --> 01:17:04.990
What kind of woman would that attract?
Uh,
I dunno,
but that's your dilemma,
buddy.

1304
01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:08.050
Good luck with it.
All right,
go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on,
yeah,

1305
01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.100
on Thursday.
