1
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.550
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:06.580
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.680
July 9th,
2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:15.880
How Wa
how's it going?
Oh,

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.430
Billy's voice is coming back.
It's coming back.
You know,

6
00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:22.480
I've been drinking my old throat coat tea there,
right.
Ben Evans,

7
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.930
some fucking food halls.
Menthyl lip this,

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.320
um,
you know,
just,
you know,

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.700
trying not to yell at people and traffic,
trying to meditate,

10
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.200
trying to learn about patients.
Oh,

11
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:42.380
that guy cut me off.
Oh,
if I get upset,
that's my fault.

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.040
According to the fucking meditation guy on headspace.

13
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.020
So he tries to chuckle through blaming me for other people's contentness.

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.360
That's a challenge.
That's a challenge to try to remain focused.
Yeah.

15
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:57.890
What kind of a fucking guy,
you know,

16
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.890
he's just sitting there trying to get into a zone is telling you that things are

17
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:04.010
your fault.
I know he chuckles along.

18
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.440
I know he's probably right.
Why?
Why,

19
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.470
why should I have expectations when I'm on the highways of La that somebody

20
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.890
isn't going to pass me doing 90 on the right while somebody's in the left lane's

21
00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:22.210
doom with 35 and I'm in the middle like you know,

22
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.930
and I'm in the middle.
I'm the victim.
I'm the guy driving perfectly.

23
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.800
I never pass people on the right ball shit.
Every once in awhile I do.

24
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.620
I tried to be cognizant.

25
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.830
Um,
I don't even know what I have so much shit to talk about.
I mean,

26
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.040
I always talk,
but I mean I actually have shit to talk about and by the way,

27
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.510
shout out to that fucking lunatic who listened to my whole fucking give the oil

28
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:54.080
men the son.
And he took it seriously.
Like he's trying to debunk my theory,

29
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.630
<v 2>you know,
was like,
oh
well,</v>

30
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.350
oh did you take a ball?

31
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.270
A 2.4 billion cars out there who do both

32
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.210
<v 1>least.
That's the way I read it.
That's the way you sounded in my head in,</v>

33
00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:13.940
and I just wrote him back,
was like,
dude,
how many f bombs did I drop?

34
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.320
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.750
<v 1>During the pre,
the presentation of that theory.</v>

36
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.750
Why are you acting like you went to a Ted talk

37
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.450
was I liked the one person you felt smarter than on the Internet.
It's like,
Oh,

38
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:30.770
here's my opportunity to be like,
oh,
maybe if you fucking,

39
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.360
it's the classic Internet,
the way you dive into a debate.
Oh,

40
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.330
maybe try this next time

41
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.240
everybody coming at you.

42
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:46.230
Like they have like these like just a bunch of awards up on the wall behind
them,

43
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.270
you know,
as opposed to you,
you know what,
whatever you,
what do you got to do?

44
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.800
What hacky fucking posters do you have on your wall?
Huh?

45
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.770
What's a hacky poster for,
for the millennials?
When I was growing up,

46
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:04.270
you had to have the Farrah Fawcett poster.
Uh,

47
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.640
I don't know,
a Fonzie poster,
Isam,
Shit like that.
It was,
you know,

48
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.620
it was the 70s when I was still into posters.
Um,

49
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.871
I don't want to talk about,
you know,

50
00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:17.520
I'm doing it is I'm talking to you guys on trying to get fucking comfortable in

51
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:20.530
this God damn couch.
We bought one of these fucking pullout couches and Kate's,

52
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:23.110
we have guests.
What?
Once every three years,

53
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.970
someone's going to stop by here for Thanksgiving

54
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.420
because his fucking wife had enough with them.

55
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.390
So instead I got to be on this thing that's not a couch and not a bed.

56
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.580
All it looks fluffy.
Oh,
it looks comfortable,

57
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:41.320
but the looks are deceiving.
So anyways,
I,

58
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:44.680
um,
I've been back in the writers' room,
um,

59
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.590
back in the writers' room for emphasis family.

60
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.260
We're knocking out a episode one.

61
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.940
We got our first table read on Thursday,
and then,
um,

62
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.640
I'm actually gonna have to do a couple of table reads over the phone because I

63
00:03:57.641 --> 00:04:00.360
got some acting work,
um,

64
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.390
in New York City and a spoiler alert.

65
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.250
They're rebooting sex in the city except this time they're doing it with guys.

66
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.050
And guess who gets to play?
Samantha?
I Dunno.

67
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.180
What's Cynthia Nixon,
whoever the red head is.
All right,
I'm going to wear it.

68
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:22.330
A short little wig.
All right.
And I'm going to be the smart girl of the fellas.

69
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.410
That's what's going to happen.

70
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.200
<v 1>It's kind of like that John Travolta movie,
hogs,
whatever the fuck it was called,</v>

72
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.110
where they rode around on motorcycles.
You know,

73
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.810
I hate that those movies are hits.

74
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.410
It just reminds me of the sadness that most people live in,

75
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.560
that they can relate to that movie.
Like,
oh,

76
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:44.820
wouldn't it be awesome if we could still go out and do fun stuff?

77
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.820
I don't know why you can't.

78
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.960
I don't know why my voice still cracks at 49 years of age.

79
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.590
I don't know why you can't.
Why can't you continue to do fun shit?

80
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.190
<v 0>Okay,</v>

81
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.400
<v 1>two reasons.
One,
you're exaggerating.</v>

82
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.260
You're your importance as a parent,

83
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.823
<v 0>okay?</v>

84
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.380
<v 1>You know what I mean?
And I believe that's the most important role you love.</v>

85
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:12.120
I know,
I know it's important,

86
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:16.830
but the fact that you think you got to fucking be there 24 seven staring at your

87
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:19.740
kid and you can't just sneak down the street,

88
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.000
you know,
for fucking 90 minutes during the day,
like some,

89
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.730
what the fuck is going to happen to your kid?
And those know how fragile

90
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.500
a mindset is your family in that,

91
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:37.000
God forbid you go down the street for 90 minutes,
you know,

92
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.950
figure 20 minute drive,
20 minute back,

93
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:41.440
you've got to shower after whatever the fuck you do,
right.
You go to,

94
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:45.190
you go rock climbing.
Yeah.
One of those rock climbing gyms.
You know,

95
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:48.640
you'd take your towel caot your little talc,
fanny pack,

96
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:50.830
whatever the fuck it is you do.
Yeah.

97
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:53.800
When in your head you're going up mount Everest cause that's all you got.

98
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.070
So you got,
you can't go all the way over there and walked by dead

99
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.570
<v 3>people in sleeping bags while you got a family of family baggage do.</v>

100
00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:04.760
You can't do that.
Right?
You can't fucking do that.

101
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.080
You've got to go down the fucking rock wall.
Okay.

102
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.170
People either over exaggerate the importance of being a guard down parent or it

103
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.030
they fucking,
they're afraid of their wife.

104
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.580
Just say,
look,
I need to go do this.

105
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.900
I'll be back in 90 minutes just and then just go do it.
What is she going to do?

106
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:31.700
Tackle you on the way to your car?

107
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.450
The worst she can do is just be more while the,

108
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:38.950
where she can do is divorce you and take all your shit.
You know,
who's kidding,

109
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:42.740
who?
Um,
whatever.
You know what I mean?

110
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.200
You got an empty once in a while.
Wow.

111
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.180
We steal away like fucking every two,
three days.

112
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:54.200
You can't just go down the street and just fucking do something.
Um,

113
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.090
I'm saying this because I have a tremendous amount of guilt because,
uh,

114
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.350
I came home from work,
right.
And um,
you know,

115
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:07.290
I make sure I don't work as much as I did last year before I became a parent

116
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.140
because I became the most important person in the world too for me.

117
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.750
Um,
so I,

118
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.460
I come home like a couple hours earlier than I did last year.
Right.

119
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.280
So I can take my daughter for a walk around the block.

120
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.970
We're going to walk around the right.
That's what I do.
Okay.

121
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:29.180
So the other day I'm driving to work,
no one driving work.

122
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.360
I just dropped my car off to get serviced.
Right.

123
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.520
I got the old truck I'm driving now.

124
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:39.521
I can either go right to fucking work or it'd be like 10 15 minutes early or I

125
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:43.340
can swing by my house and hang with my daughter who just woke up.

126
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:46.940
So obviously no fucking brainer.
I do that.
I hang out with them for 10 minutes.

127
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:50.570
I have a great fucking time and then I leave and then I drive to work feeling

128
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:53.690
like a great dad,
feeling great that I did that.

129
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.630
I got my priorities straight,
right?

130
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.120
I'm going to raise a,

131
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.420
a great citizen for this wonderful land that everybody else's jealous up.

132
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.470
That's why they don't like us around the world.

133
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.010
It has nothing to do with our foreign policy.

134
00:08:10.011 --> 00:08:13.970
I'm so sick of that excuse.
Okay,
just admit it.

135
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.250
You like her blue jeans.

136
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.690
You liked that we feed cows to other cows,
right?
You like that you,
you know,

137
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:28.490
you like it.
You're over there in Europe,
you're in Asia,
wherever you are,

138
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.050
you're all fucking jammed up.

139
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.940
Everybody had fucking driving cars on cow paths or there's like 90,000

140
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.940
skyscrapers like over and fucking age of Jesus Christ.

141
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.730
Hong Kong is the most astounding fucking the,

142
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.280
I didn't realize it was that much concrete in the fucking world.

143
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.090
They had clusters of Manhattan skyline,

144
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.580
just pocked all around that place.
It was just never fucking to,
um,

145
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.090
I would love to meet the Donald of Hong Kong talking about how he has the

146
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:00.580
greatest skyscraper ever.
Um,
but anyway,

147
00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:04.150
so I come home and I'm like,
all right,
this is great.
I saw,

148
00:09:04.151 --> 00:09:06.640
I have 10 minutes this morning.
I'm coming on,
I'm going to get the hang.

149
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.130
Go for this,
walk around the block and I walk into my house.

150
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:17.070
All right.
And I noticed it's hard to open the door.
I can't open it all away.

151
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.010
And I look around the corner and what do I see?

152
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.570
I see like five giant fucking boxes and then I see an even bigger box across the

153
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:31.770
room and they all say Gretsch drums on him.
My drum kit arrived.

154
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.380
I couldn't fuck it.
I was so convinced that I was like,
Murphy's law.

155
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.850
The second I go to New York for two fucking weeks,
uh,

156
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.460
that fucking drum kit's going to come.

157
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.430
There's going to be some nos pick and jackass delivering it,

158
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:48.510
and he's just gonna fucking leave it on the front porch and some asshole's going

159
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:52.650
to take it.
Um,
but for once,
you know,

160
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:56.420
life worked out right?
I showed up.
It's there.
It is there.

161
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.440
I don't think I've ever been so fucking excited in my adult life.

162
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.780
Ever saw the drum kit came at it.
Spent literally,

163
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.700
as far as when I saw it,
I don't even think it's about 12 hours in my house.
Boom,

164
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.690
right over to the rehearsal space and unpacked it in each box.

165
00:10:19.691 --> 00:10:22.050
She on pack,
there's a box with s in it,
right?

166
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.910
You open that box up and then there's the drum and then there's this little
card,

167
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.410
this little card,
right?

168
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.400
Like a birthday card from Gretsch drums and it says that great Gretsch sound.

169
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.460
And it's written in a,
that writing that millennials can't read.

170
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:36.480
Whatever the fuck you call it.

171
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.950
We call it writing versus printing cursive is what they call it.

172
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.140
Maybe that's why millennials don't like it,
you know,
cause you know,
Kurt,

173
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.200
I don't want to curse.
I don't want offend anybody.
I'm going to print

174
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.420
or maybe they were on computers all day bill and they just don't see it anymore.

175
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.790
All right,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
Whatever.

176
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.720
Maybe just an old guy bill and you're just trashing younger people cause they're

177
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:02.950
younger than you and they're still in the parameter of hey,
you know,

178
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.440
have a point maybe.
Okay,
whatever.
So,
um,

179
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.890
I load up my truck,
I drive over the place but 20 minutes down,

180
00:11:13.891 --> 00:11:18.891
fucked and straight and I started taking these things out of the box and um,

181
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.520
the absolutely fucking gorgeous is a couple of pieces of hardware that I need to

182
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:30.060
get,
but I am going to,
I'm going to tweet a fucking picture of that thing.
Um,

183
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.161
probably Monday,

184
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:35.010
tomorrow I'm going to go over and pick up the last couple of pieces of hardware

185
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:35.844
that I need.

186
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.790
They are fucking gorgeous and I don't give a shit what you are.

187
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.930
You like those,
those loops?
Like you fucking,

188
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:47.910
I don't give a fuck what you think of the color.
I love him.
I love him.
So,
um,

189
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.020
I am,
I'm just over the fucking moon.

190
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:54.730
I can't fucking believe get best thing I ever did.

191
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.750
As I got rid of that old fucking Ludwig and went out and bought the kit that I

192
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.030
wanted.
I can't fucking wait to go over there.

193
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:05.620
But now I have this crushing fucking guilt,
you know,

194
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.980
being a Dang,
or you should be with your daughter right now.
It's like,

195
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:11.440
I can't not fucking yelling at myself as I'm driving over there.

196
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.600
I can't fucking go down if a fucking 90 minutes.

197
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.460
Not even 90.
I play for an hour at 20 bag 20.
Oh,

198
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.520
that's an hour and 40 fucking minutes.
Oh Shit.
That's more,

199
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.120
that's a hundred minutes of Chase's.
All right.

200
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:27.040
So I'm the worst fucking dead ever.
What do you want from me?

201
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.610
Keeps me in a good mood.
Um,
anyways,
they came and,
um,

202
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.890
I'm going over there today.
Uh,
my drum teacher,
he's gonna fucking tune him up.

203
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.030
Um,
I got him sound and halfway decent,
but,
uh,
I'm just a comedian.

204
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.000
This guy's a pro.
So these things are going to sound like,
fuck,

205
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:49.780
I don't know what they're going to sound like,
but uh,
I can't fucking wait.

206
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:54.670
I'm so God damn excited and um,
I guess,
oh Jesus,

207
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.850
my stomach's growling here.
I got to fucking,
I got my symbols.

208
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.590
I got the whole fucking thing that,
you know how nice this is,

209
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:06.130
how nice the setup is.
I'm afraid to show it to my wife.

210
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.180
That's how nice it is.
You know that Shit,

211
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.730
you know when you do something like that and then your wife just looks at it and

212
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.640
she's just kind of quiet,
doesn't say anything and it's just,
this is all they do.

213
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:19.474
They just go,

214
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.143
<v 4>Huh.</v>

215
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.860
<v 3>And you're like,
oh fuck.
How much did that,
how much?
That noise right there.</v>

216
00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:30.840
How much is that going to cost me?
You know,
all I did was buy a set of drums,

217
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:34.730
you know,
there's their fucking shit.
What's she going to go get?
Well,

218
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.330
I thought this would be fair.
Um,
maybe I'm just paranoid.
So anyways,

219
00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:43.300
I want to thank the Gretsch Drum Company for fucking making the greatest guy

220
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:44.180
damn drums I've ever,

221
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:49.110
the most beautiful fucking drums I've ever seen in my life at a packing them up.

222
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:53.070
So there wasn't a,
there wasn't a even even a piece of dust on them.

223
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.170
Absolutely gorgeous.

224
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.980
And I'm going to go over there today and I'm going to play cause I'm doing the

225
00:13:57.981 --> 00:14:00.210
good goddamn comedy jam.

226
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.680
The fucking two or three year anniversary.
I've lost track at this point.

227
00:14:04.681 --> 00:14:09.150
I think it's the two year anniversary.
When did it start in 14 or 15?

228
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.600
Maybe 14.
No,
it started in 15,

229
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.530
the two year anniversary.
And um,

230
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.470
I'm going to be singing one song even though I can't sing and then I'm going to

231
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:25.240
be sitting in on drums for the encore and uh,
no,
I am not bringing my kid over.

232
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.690
I'm not bringing it over cause uh,
I don't have any cases.

233
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.890
Plus I would be fucking losing my mind that something bad was gonna happen to

234
00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:36.910
him.
So that's it.
Um,
all right.
So there you go.

235
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.560
That's what I have to look forward to.
Um,
anyways,

236
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.230
so what do,
I didn't know where to fucking start here.

237
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.320
See if I can keep my happiness and my drum kit as I talk about this next thing I

238
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.950
saw two of the most fucked up things.

239
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.530
<v 4>Okay.</v>

240
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:57.340
<v 3>As far as,
uh,
just that have you no shame,
you know,</v>

241
00:14:57.341 --> 00:14:59.740
and I'm a piece of shit.
So for me to think that,
you know,

242
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.540
<v 4>okay,</v>

243
00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.810
<v 3>I was watching,
uh,
some fucking clip</v>

244
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.270
trashing Dr Phil and I never saw this.
I didn't realize this,

245
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:13.820
I guess like a year ago or two years ago.

246
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.170
You know that actress Shelley Duvall,
who crushed it in the shining?
Well,

247
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.500
she's in her sixties now and I guess she's having,

248
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:24.290
I don't know what she's having,
she's having some sort of mental issue.

249
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.300
I don't know what it is.
Okay.

250
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.370
But she's old and she needs medical help.
That scumbag.

251
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.420
Dr Phil,

252
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.350
who I called it the second I saw that guy I called it I,

253
00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.810
that I was at,
that guy looks like a fucking crooked cop.
The second I saw him,

254
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:45.350
I was like,
that guy looks like he planned a fucking gun on you.
You know,

255
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.760
he'd fucking shoot you over some routine fucking traffic stop.

256
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.220
And he pulled out and he'd do that to a white person.

257
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.090
That's how fucking nuts this guy is.
Right.
He's not your standard,

258
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.840
you know,
bad cop going after minorities.
This guy would do it.

259
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:04.040
This guys are gonna see as a serial killer look,
doesn't he?
Um,

260
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.223
anyways,

261
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.980
that piece of Shit fucking interviewed Shelley Duvall and talk to her is if he

262
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:14.180
was trying to help her.

263
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.470
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

264
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:19.550
<v 3>And she was saying all of this stuff about how Robin Williams was still alive</v>

265
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:20.450
and fucking,
you know,

266
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:23.900
the earth is flat and just all kinds of stuff like that where it's clearly like,

267
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:26.300
oh my God,
all right,
shut off the camera,
shut off the cameras.
Come on,

268
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.470
let's not do this to her.
And he's sitting there talking to her la,
so he like,

269
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:34.580
he's going to try to help her.
So lock you think,
oh,

270
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:38.210
Robin Williams is still alive.

271
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.670
Okay.
Um,
I think you need,
like he's,

272
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.620
he was acting the entire fucking time.

273
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:51.250
Like he was trying to help her rather than completely exploiting this famous

274
00:16:51.901 --> 00:16:56.880
actress who's now in like,
you know,
this mental condition.

275
00:16:56.881 --> 00:17:01.030
It's just,
I was,
it was.
I don't,
I don't,
how do people,

276
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.080
how do you still sit down and watch that guy's fucking shelf?

277
00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:08.940
Fuck that guy in everything.
He's fucking connected to
Jesus.

278
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.900
You don't have enough fucking money.
You can't,

279
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:16.330
you don't drag enough fucking penniless people onto your fucking show.

280
00:17:16.331 --> 00:17:19.450
You don't have enough honey booboo.
People coming on your fucking show.

281
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:20.860
You got to do that.

282
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.850
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

283
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.870
<v 3>Jesus fucking Christ.
But you know,</v>

284
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:30.470
I've been meditating and well I guess I'm not supposed to get upset about this.

285
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:32.270
I should,
we,
you know,
I should expect it.

286
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.460
I should expect that behavior out of him.

287
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.630
So you're saying that you're hearing these voices in your head or [inaudible] I

288
00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:47.840
don't.
I'm making up all of this shit.
I couldn't get,
I couldn't get,

289
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.380
<v 4>yeah,</v>

290
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.990
<v 1>I don't think I got 20 seconds.
30 seconds into it.</v>

291
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:54.570
The second she said the Robin Williams thing,
and then they cut to him.

292
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.940
So you're PSI.
And once he did that,

293
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.860
I had to just shut it off.
Shut it off.

294
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.590
Shut it off,
Doctor Phil,
have you no shame.

295
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.570
I swear to God,
that fucking guy.
I'm trying to think what he wouldn't interview,

296
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.980
you know,
what wouldn't you like?
First of all,

297
00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:24.981
I love that people watch those shows is I is if they're like watching somebody

298
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:29.880
trying to help somebody,
then not,
you can't fix somebody in a half hour episode

299
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.050
on that time when he had that girl on that little girl on there,
the uh,
you know,

300
00:18:36.051 --> 00:18:37.400
catch me outside how my dad,

301
00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:41.420
that one that went fucking viral and then he has her back on again.

302
00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:44.040
He's like putting people thought,
oh,
was explored nurse.

303
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:48.350
So we took out the studio audience.
Yeah,
but you still broadcasted it.

304
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.100
I Dunno,
but you know something.
I'm a hypocritical cut.
All right.

305
00:18:58.101 --> 00:19:02.870
Because I still watched the catch me outside.
How about that?

306
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.400
I just kept seeing it on Twitter and I was like,
I have to see what that is.

307
00:19:07.401 --> 00:19:10.190
And I'm not gonna lie to you.
I did watch it and I did enjoy it.

308
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.360
So maybe I've got a knock back.
My criticisms,
criticisms,

309
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:18.020
why don't you just exploit people that still have their whole life ahead of him?

310
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.890
Jesus fucking Christ.
I don't know.

311
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.700
Did I become the asshole by the end of that?
I don't remember.

312
00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:29.960
I don't even really know where the fuck that whole thing went.
Um,
so anyways,

313
00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:33.590
I was watching the,
the f one race in Austria,

314
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.990
which by the way,
this,

315
00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:40.340
there's something fucking crazy going on in Austria right now.

316
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.010
Uh,
Jewish people relax.
Um,
it's not that,
um,

317
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.770
well,
it's kind of is,
it's kind of related to that then you don't,
you know,

318
00:19:54.771 --> 00:19:59.420
in fucking in England,
like all his shit is old because they,

319
00:19:59.421 --> 00:20:02.510
you know,
that's the origins of white people.

320
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:06.080
Unless she listened to a nausea album and somehow we all came from Egypt,

321
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.900
which they're not really black either,
are they?
They're like Arab,

322
00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.150
you know what I mean?
But he's like,
yeah,
there are African,
it's like,
all right,

323
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.130
well I'm German and Irish.
Do I also claim to be Italian?
Because I'm European,

324
00:20:19.131 --> 00:20:23.390
like African and African is a continent I've never been able to.

325
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.430
So you're say in La,
we all came from Egypt.

326
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.690
Tell you right now,
there's no fucking way I did.
If you ever saw my fucking legs.

327
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:37.841
I mean,

328
00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:42.841
I don't know how fucking long ago my ancestors left Africa or how we did what we

329
00:20:44.861 --> 00:20:49.210
sat in a fucking Snow Jacuzzi fucking 2000 years.

330
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.470
I Dunno.
But I do actually,
I do believe that we all came,

331
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.390
we had to all come from the same fucking

332
00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.010
<v 5>uh,
whatever lake.</v>

333
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:02.871
<v 1>Do you know,</v>

334
00:21:02.871 --> 00:21:05.730
you realize what you're listening to right now you're listening to a comedian

335
00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:09.150
trying to figure out like just because he watched like 10 minutes of Neil

336
00:21:09.151 --> 00:21:13.350
degrasse Tyson,
whatever his fucking name is as he's falling asleep.

337
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.900
And I,
if I can quote de Grasse Tyson,
whatever the fuck his first name is.

338
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.993
Uh,

339
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:25.770
I believe he thinks we came from trees and I don't mean like we were living in

340
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:29.490
trees like we were apes is like no trees.

341
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.390
Like I don't know.
I that was one of those things.

342
00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:36.200
So I was just like fall asleep cause it's like this fucking guy's crazy.

343
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.910
I fell asleep.
I never saw the other other part of it.
Gino,

344
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.920
what the deal is,
you'd go over his house and he convinced you of it.

345
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.330
You go over and eat em on a turtleneck with a sport coat over it,

346
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:52.360
like smoking a pipe and there'd be a fire in the fireplace,
right?

347
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.790
He'd come in and you'd have all these fucking artifacts,
you know,

348
00:21:56.791 --> 00:22:01.110
you and your wife show up as these other couples there and you just stick in.

349
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:01.410
Like,

350
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:05.280
this guy's either going to fucking tell me the secrets of the world or I'm going

351
00:22:05.281 --> 00:22:09.180
to slowly lose consciousness and end up in one of those sounds of the lamb pits

352
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.980
trying to steal his dog.

353
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.320
Um,
anyways,

354
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.590
the fuck am I talking about?
I uh,
I assume I'm white.
I'll like,
oh,

355
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.510
what happened in Austria?
So what's happening in Austria?

356
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:29.940
It might have already been solved.

357
00:22:29.941 --> 00:22:33.840
I just remember seeing it a little while ago because a couple of weeks ago I was

358
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:38.940
trying to see where the f one circuit was taken him next.
And uh,

359
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:40.320
I guess in Austria,

360
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:46.140
Hitler's house still exists like where he was born,

361
00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:47.730
but it's more like an apartment building.

362
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:53.910
So I guess all these neo Nazis go there and they do like the Neo Nazi,

363
00:22:53.911 --> 00:22:58.580
like Yolo Selfie,
Yo,
instead of doing the peace sign,
I bet this.

364
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.170
But then you can't do like a full sieg Heil,

365
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.523
<v 5>you know,</v>

366
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.690
<v 1>in a selfie.
That's a hard to get.
Your arms aren't long enough to hold it out.</v>

367
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:09.640
So they probably do it to the side,
you know,

368
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.100
it's just from the elbow to the tip.
And then they do the duck face.

369
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.690
Right.
I guess they've been doing that.
I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

370
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.550
They're doing some shit like that in front of it.

371
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.710
And for some reason people feel that if you take that place down

372
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.330
that you know those guys aren't going to continue to exist.

373
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.270
Um,
I don't know about that.
What?

374
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

375
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.130
<v 1>I mean,
what are people going,
you know,
I was going to be a neo Nazi,</v>

376
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:47.510
but then day took down on Hitler's fucking building,
so whatever.

377
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.340
So there's somebody that owns it and he's like,
Nah,

378
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:51.850
I'm not tearing this shit down.
And the government's like,
right,

379
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.610
look at how fucking say's it.
All right.
That's how they talk in Austria too.

380
00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:00.670
Everybody talks like my bed sort of fucking English accent maybe.

381
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:04.640
What don't,
what the fuck it is Davy Jones,
whatever I'm doing.
Um,

382
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.670
so there's some big battle about that and they're gonna like knock it down.

383
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:10.790
But I gotta be honest with you,
as much as I'm not down with the Nazi.

384
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:13.580
So like if I went to Austria,
I would go see that place.

385
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.820
I would be like the most evil baby,
Eh,

386
00:24:18.821 --> 00:24:23.330
you know the Jordan of evil babies,
you know,

387
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.930
w fucking came home to that place right there.

388
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.150
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

389
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.500
<v 1>People walked in and saw baby Hitler and we'll like,
oh,
isn't he adorable?</v>

390
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.170
Look at his eyes is a lot going on in there.

391
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.440
So they want to get rid of that.
Um,
I don't know.

392
00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:49.360
I thought that that was fucking interesting.
Like this is what kills me.

393
00:24:49.361 --> 00:24:51.240
He's like,
who fucking,

394
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.160
how do people know that that's what he grew up.

395
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.950
So many people fucking died in world war two.

396
00:25:00.951 --> 00:25:05.520
You think that anybody that even remotely fucking remembered it,
the old piece,

397
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.570
<v 6>well God can grow up in that place right down the street.</v>

398
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.170
Oh,
he had a funny look on his face.

399
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.740
<v 1>Dumb,
right.
They just pass the story on.</v>

400
00:25:19.741 --> 00:25:24.741
It's too juicy a gossip that it just fucking hit a little.

401
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.850
It just keeps getting passed down to the point they got to knock down this

402
00:25:29.851 --> 00:25:33.000
perfectly good fucking building.
I guess it needs to be redone a little bit.

403
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.270
Like we're doing what the baseball stadiums over here and then what happens?

404
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.630
They throw it out and ends up in the ocean,

405
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.720
throw it out the fucking Mediterranean Sea.

406
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.370
That water,
you know the water that when you go over there,

407
00:25:48.371 --> 00:25:51.610
they try to say there's no sharks in them until you go on the Internet.

408
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:56.880
Is that go?
Yeah.
I just saw there was a couple of attacks.
I am,
Amy does Ben,

409
00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.910
a couple of attacks,
but you know that,
you know that's,
it's rare.

410
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.410
Yeah.
Shark attacks in general are rare considering most of us are on the fucking

411
00:26:05.411 --> 00:26:09.520
land.
I Dunno,
I swam in the Mediterranean.

412
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.700
I absolutely loved it.
It was fucking life changing.
But afterwards,

413
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:16.240
when I was reading about the shark attacks,
there is just this fucking,

414
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:22.300
it's the scariest thing other than being tortured,
you know,

415
00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.220
I'm trying,
I'm trying to think,
you know,
of stuff equal to that.

416
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:28.600
Speaking of shark attacks,

417
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.560
I was watching this fucking movie that starred Paul Walker.
Rest in peace.

418
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.470
Jessica Alba,
uh,

419
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.880
Scott Conn this other woman,
her name escapes me.

420
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.320
Her name is scapes me.
Um,

421
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.090
I was watching that movie and uh,
I don't,
what the fuck it's called?

422
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.360
I don't know what the Fuck's calling Jessica Alba.
First of all.

423
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:56.580
It's so fucking beautiful.
You just say she doesn't have to do anything.

424
00:26:56.581 --> 00:27:00.630
She just sits there.
She looks fucking amazing,
Greg.
And uh,

425
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.350
that movie was so fucking ridiculous,
yet entertaining.

426
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.150
I don't think I've ever seen people hold their breath longer underwater in my

427
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:11.550
life.
You know,

428
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.530
there's a fucking crashed plane under the water.
They go down there,

429
00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:18.380
they find drugs.
This is even like a spoiler alert.

430
00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.750
This is like how many fucking times they'd done the movie.

431
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.890
We're regular people find a bag of money or they find some fucking drugs.
Ooh.

432
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.400
Should we do I think we should leave it?
No.
Who should take it?
Man,

433
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:30.860
this is a shot.
Right?

434
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.960
And then the fucking bad guys figured out that they fucking took it somehow.

435
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:38.010
Right.
The same classic fucking story.
Right.

436
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.610
Then Tom Hanks lost his wife and he meets Meg Ryan in Seattle.

437
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:43.140
It's all the same fucking movie.

438
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.550
Billy crystal comes in and says a couple of things.
Okay.

439
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:52.551
Then Rom Reiner makes a cameo cause he's directing the thing and then somebody

440
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:53.580
starts shooting up.

441
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:56.430
Tom Cruise runs through and the doves come up and there's your fucking movie.

442
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.560
It's every Hollywood movie.
Somebody is getting too old for this shit.

443
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.470
Uh,
the two people that hate each other have realized that they,
they,

444
00:28:06.471 --> 00:28:09.740
they now love each other.
Uh,

445
00:28:09.741 --> 00:28:12.740
the two photos then look at each other and they realize that,
you know what?

446
00:28:12.741 --> 00:28:13.574
I respect you.

447
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:14.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

448
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.180
<v 1>You know,
the days of thunder ending,</v>

449
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.630
I think.
I think that covers it.
All right.
Um,
anyway,

450
00:28:22.631 --> 00:28:26.740
so we'll watch this fucking movie and at one point the bad guys have scuba gear.

451
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.630
Paul Walker and fucking Scott Carr and have no scuba gear.

452
00:28:31.631 --> 00:28:34.060
They just dived out of this fucking played.

453
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.230
But just like I know I totally fucking feet under the water

454
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.240
so they fucking,

455
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.810
the scuba guys swimming or the plane looking form Scott Conn is sitting in one

456
00:28:47.751 --> 00:28:50.900
of the,
in the copilot seat pretending to be dead.

457
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:51.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

458
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.720
<v 1>He had enough time to sit there and gather himself,
pretend to be dead,</v>

459
00:28:55.721 --> 00:28:59.840
holding his fucking breath and the scuba guy comes up and looks at him.

460
00:28:59.841 --> 00:29:01.180
He was like,
well I guess he's dead.

461
00:29:01.181 --> 00:29:04.780
And he keeps going and meanwhile they keep cutting the Paul Walker rest in
peace,

462
00:29:04.781 --> 00:29:05.380
right.

463
00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.380
He keeps fucking peeking in little more than a windows and the seat is like five

464
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:13.310
fucking minutes long.
Realtime.
It feels,
oh,

465
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.930
when you just doing the math at how long it would take to get down there,

466
00:29:15.931 --> 00:29:19.710
how long you could fucking stay down there and he's like Pekin.

467
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.610
And then he would just ducked back out of the way and all they had the decency

468
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:27.940
to do is have like one or two little air bubbles go like,
okay,

469
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:29.323
<v 0>yeah,</v>

470
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.780
<v 1>if I'm underwater and I don't have any fucking air,</v>

471
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.080
I mean your heart's already racing like a fucking lunatics are eating up that

472
00:29:36.081 --> 00:29:36.561
oxygen.

473
00:29:36.561 --> 00:29:39.650
Forget about the fact that this is drug dealers with scuba gear that want to

474
00:29:39.651 --> 00:29:42.160
kill you and you're in shark infested.
Fucking waters

475
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.640
<v 3>didn't affect Paul Walker or Scott Conn in the least.</v>

476
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.330
Somehow they were able to throw affective punches under the water I made.
It was,

477
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.800
it was unbelievable.
The leaps of faith that you had to make in that movie.

478
00:29:55.801 --> 00:29:58.440
Yet I still enjoyed it,
you know,

479
00:29:58.441 --> 00:30:01.080
cause every time you will like this is fucking ridiculous.

480
00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.530
They would cut the Jessica Alba just going like,

481
00:30:04.531 --> 00:30:09.120
should we keep the jogs or something?
You Go,
oh my God,
it's fucking beautiful.

482
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.600
Genius.
The editing of that movie is genius.
I don't know what it's called though.

483
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.680
Does she has one seat?
She just leans against a door brushing your teeth.

484
00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:18.450
It's like I could watch a movie of that.

485
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.760
Jessica Alba gets ready for bed.
Um,
so check it out.

486
00:30:23.761 --> 00:30:25.960
I think that's what that movie is.
It's called something,

487
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.150
something about the deep,
they're always called the deep the cove.

488
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.310
I Dunno what it was,
but I was just sitting there,
you know,
in my own way,

489
00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:40.100
making fun of the movie,
trying to make Nia laugh.
That was just like jazz gum.

490
00:30:40.101 --> 00:30:44.190
The,
I'm not going to wear his shirt.
Nausea,
you going to wear that shirt?

491
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.010
Um,
which is probably childish.
So what I do here,
wait a second,

492
00:30:50.011 --> 00:30:52.180
I got to find out the other name of that actress on that movie.

493
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:56.400
It can't name three of the four stars.
Right.
Can I hang on a second?

494
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.730
Actually,
you know what?
Fuck that.
I'm going to need to look that up.

495
00:30:59.731 --> 00:31:03.410
I have to give somebody,
I got to give two people a shout out.
Um,

496
00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.590
I've been watching bloodline.
I'm up to episode eight,

497
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.260
season three.
I got two more episodes to go.

498
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.810
That show at series is gut wrenching.
Like,

499
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:18.730
I can only watch two of them and then I have to shut it off.
And I,

500
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.870
I've never watched a show where I get so mad at the characters,

501
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:27.800
you know,
I guess so fucking mad.
Like,
why the fuck did you just do that?
Shut up,

502
00:31:27.801 --> 00:31:31.850
stop talking.
All of that stuff.
Most of it's with the Kevin Character.

503
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.573
<v 7>MMM.</v>

504
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.980
<v 3>Norbert Leo Butz,
one of like five people.</v>

505
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:42.790
Whoever won the best lead male Tony Award.

506
00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.413
<v 7>MMM.</v>

507
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.570
<v 3>That which is a Broadway Oscar,
basically these amazing fucking actor.
So anyways,</v>

508
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:53.290
there's a guy on that show who plays Eric O'bannon,

509
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:57.580
who's absolutely killing it.
His name is Jamie Mcshane.

510
00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.380
And for breaking bad fans,

511
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:02.920
if you're wondering why do I know that guy's face,

512
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.490
why would his face fucking make,
what am I,

513
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.440
how do I know that guy?
If you're a breaking bad fan,
the episode,

514
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:17.530
I'm not going to give anything away.
The one that evolved the train,

515
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.260
all right.
I can't remember.

516
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:24.400
He played the conductor or the engineer and uh,

517
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.090
he was a great fucking guy.

518
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.280
And in his work on this show is fucking unbelievable.
I don't know.

519
00:32:31.281 --> 00:32:36.260
I want to quote his lines,
but I want I'd everybody like when they watch movies,

520
00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:37.190
it's like years later.

521
00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:40.850
Do you know my dad just saw like I this movie called standup guys

522
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.000
<v 1>and he calls me up.
He's like,
Christ fell.
Yay.</v>

523
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:46.070
I tell you that the other night I'm sitting there,
I'm like,

524
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.790
I'm like narcoleptic I'm falling asleep on the couch and wake up at three in the

525
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:53.460
morning and watching this movie and a,

526
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.300
and I'm already laughing cause I know it's going be some shit I did like fucking

527
00:32:56.301 --> 00:33:00.470
10 years ago because it's got an output cheeto and Christopher Walken and I'm

528
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:01.610
watching the movie

529
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.230
<v 8>and all of a sudden there you are.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.
He wakes up my mother,</v>

530
00:33:06.231 --> 00:33:07.120
he goes,
Jesus Christ,

531
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.860
<v 1>that's all my parents paid,
touched it in my career.
They want shit that I did.</v>

532
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.450
It goes,
it was a great movie.

533
00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.020
<v 8>Oh tell your belly at all.
You could do this comedy stuff.</v>

534
00:33:21.021 --> 00:33:25.030
He could do the dramatic shift day.
Fucking get it all figured out.

535
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.440
<v 1>That's what he said.
You could do the dramatic shit.</v>

536
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.790
It's my favorite thing anybody said to me all week.
Yeah,

537
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.220
I could do the dramatic shit.
Um,

538
00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.470
so anyways,
two thumbs up from my dad for a,

539
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.570
the fucking standup guys.
Check it out if you get a chance.

540
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.800
Anyways,
Jamie Mcshane's is fucking kill everybody is killing it on that show.

541
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.310
And then

542
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.790
<v 3>also,
uh,
John Leguizamo.</v>

543
00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.070
I mean,
has that guy ever been bad at anything?

544
00:33:58.071 --> 00:34:00.420
He's fucking eat everything he's in.
He makes it better.

545
00:34:00.421 --> 00:34:02.180
If the guy's fucking unreal and

546
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:08.170
he's like creepy and hilarious all at the same time,

547
00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:10.690
which I don't know how you'd do that unless you're a fucking genius.

548
00:34:10.691 --> 00:34:14.530
Like that guy.
This is same.
Um,
uh,
how do I do?

549
00:34:14.531 --> 00:34:15.910
I don't want to fucking ruin it for people.

550
00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:21.580
He goes in and he orders like what we used to call like a slurpee or a frosty.

551
00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:23.110
You wouldn't one of those see orders,
one of those.

552
00:34:23.111 --> 00:34:27.120
It's one of the funniest fucking scenes I've seen in a long time.
Uh,

553
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.300
just start watching bloodline and I'm telling you,
if you,

554
00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:34.301
if you want to not have your insides get fucking all twisted up,

555
00:34:34.481 --> 00:34:39.460
just you do two episodes at a time.
Okay.
The first season,
you know,

556
00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:41.410
it's like,
all right,
you know,
it starts a little slow,

557
00:34:41.411 --> 00:34:45.070
like most series don't because they've got to establish who the characters are,

558
00:34:45.071 --> 00:34:49.120
what the background is.
But once that fucking Brock starts rolling down the hill,

559
00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.920
so I'm going to watch the last two episodes today and um,

560
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.470
and I,
I don't know,
you know,
I'm excited to see what happens.

561
00:34:59.471 --> 00:35:03.670
But then I also have that,
you know,
like I almost had the balls to say this.

562
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.140
I almost had the nerve to say like,
you know,
when you're finishing a great book,

563
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.243
like I read,

564
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:14.410
I remember back in the day when I used to read in a book would end and I used to

565
00:35:14.411 --> 00:35:18.520
read a lot of that was that guy who did all the train spotting and Marabou stork

566
00:35:18.521 --> 00:35:23.050
nightmare books.
I used to read all of his shit,
urban Welsh or something.

567
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.670
Then I started reading the classics.

568
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.600
I remember I read the full version of the three musketeers,
the three musketeers,

569
00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.520
the count of Monte Cristo.

570
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:38.510
It was like 700 something pages of the smallest fucking type set or what a font

571
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.750
you've ever seen in life.
And I'm like,
I'm finishing this fucking thing.

572
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.040
I'm finishing this fucking thing.
And um,

573
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.220
I just would try to read like 20 pages a day.

574
00:35:51.221 --> 00:35:55.490
It took me months to finish that fucking book,
Eh,

575
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.400
but I did,
I finished it and it was like,
wow.

576
00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.390
Like I spent a significant part of my life reading this book.

577
00:36:02.391 --> 00:36:05.330
That's how it looks,
how slow I read and all these yet.

578
00:36:05.331 --> 00:36:08.150
And I was always proud that I read that book.
I read it like 20 years ago.

579
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:09.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

580
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.640
<v 3>And I remember thinking like,
you know,
this is what people did back then.</v>

581
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.170
They had time to read books like this because there wasn't the internet,

582
00:36:18.171 --> 00:36:20.060
there wasn't the TV and all that,

583
00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:22.430
and they were bored and needed to be entertained.

584
00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:25.670
So these guys would just spin these yarns that would go for six,
seven,
eight,

585
00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:29.570
900 fucking pages.
And recently,
I forget where I saw it,

586
00:36:29.571 --> 00:36:31.040
they said that Alexander Dumas,

587
00:36:31.041 --> 00:36:34.220
so however you say his name was getting paid by the word

588
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.240
and at 20 years saying,
I'm like,
you fucking asshole.

589
00:36:38.241 --> 00:36:40.520
You could have finished that shit.
Like 20 pages.

590
00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.270
I'd read like the director's cut

591
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.450
of the Count of Monte Cristo.
I still loved the book.

592
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.920
I love a story or event,
you know.
So anyways,

593
00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:59.000
this is the time when I would usually read some fucking advertising,
but I'm,

594
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:04.550
I'm doing this early
because I got shit to do tomorrow.

595
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.920
Um,
I got shit to do tomorrow,
man.

596
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.440
Uh,
I've got stuff to pick up the last few pieces of hardware that I need,

597
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.670
um,
for my kit and then I'm good to go there.

598
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:24.380
Um,
let's see.
Let's see.
Let's see.

599
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.310
The advertising has not come in yet.
So what do I do now?

600
00:37:28.311 --> 00:37:31.070
Do I just pause here and I just pretend like I have reads to do,

601
00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.120
how many minutes have I done?
37 37 minutes.
You don't,

602
00:37:35.121 --> 00:37:37.360
I'm just going to continue talking about the shit I want to.
Then I'll just do,

603
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.040
I'll just hit pause and when the advertising comes in I'll read it.

604
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:44.480
And then when the fucking the questions comes in,
I'll fucking read those too.

605
00:37:44.481 --> 00:37:46.520
So anyways,
um,

606
00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.240
so what you're saying is

607
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.680
I saw this thing,
you know,
when I shut off the f one race,

608
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.390
which is kind of becoming my teaser here,
like people are going to talk about it.

609
00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.990
Are you going to talk about it when I shut it off?
Okay,
I'll,

610
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.620
I'll talk about the f one race.
Um,

611
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.540
congratulations to a,

612
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.200
I always want to say Valerie Valtteri,
whatever his fucking name is botox.

613
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.500
He had such a good start to start that race.
They actually thought he,
uh,
he,

614
00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:21.780
she was a fucking Cheetah,
like the Indianapolis Colts there.

615
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.463
Um,

616
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.580
and it was a typical fucking f one race where it was the first guy to turn one

617
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.930
won the fucking race.
There was a fucking accident in the beginning,
right?

618
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:38.370
The guy in the fucking,
the stepchild of the red bull team that will,

619
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.970
that Rojas fucking team,
whatever the fuck,
whatever they are,
cheeses built grab.

620
00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:45.480
Yeah.
ALMANAC grabbed the fucking program.
If you going to talk about it,

621
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:48.370
have a little bit of respect for the people that actually watched the Goddamn

622
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.310
race.
What's the name of their fucking team?
What is it?
What is it?

623
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.850
Where the Toro Rosso Rossa that fucking lunatic.

624
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.020
He came in and he fucking slammed into one of the Mclaren's who then slammed

625
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:03.820
into the,
uh,
the red bull guy,

626
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:08.530
a Max Verstappen and every one of them,
their whole fucking day was over.

627
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:12.520
And that was it.
It was over.
Botox was out in front.

628
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.890
Lewis Hamilton got like a five position,
uh,
I dunno.

629
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.290
Penalty because he had to change his gearbox during qualifying.

630
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.060
So even if he was number one,

631
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:25.480
the best he could have done was I in qualifying was six.

632
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:30.000
So he was started eighth,
so I guess evidently wait,
that would be,
yeah,

633
00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.980
if I sweat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I guess he came in third anyways,
um,

634
00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.880
pretty uneventful race the whole fucking time other than,
uh,

635
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.870
then in the end it got great.
It got great,
but I actually have some,

636
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:48.030
I actually love the shit that Lewis Hamilton was talking.
Um,

637
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.420
they were talking about the whole,
uh,
his,
his bullshit with,
uh,
what's,

638
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:56.230
what's his face there?
Sebastian Vettel.
And,
uh,

639
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.180
he goes,
he goes,
you know what he planned to do?
He goes,
you know,

640
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:04.830
I'll go out there.
I'll try to explain a few of his weaknesses.
Just floats,

641
00:40:04.831 --> 00:40:09.460
sat out there.
So of course the report of Bites and goes,

642
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:12.010
uh,
what are some of his weaknesses?
Would you say?

643
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.280
His temper is,
uh,

644
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.260
is one of his weaknesses because I guess this guy a Vettel,
he's,
he's,

645
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.230
he's dangerously approaching 12 penalty points.
If you get 12 penalty points,

646
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.280
you have to sit out of race within a calendar year that basically pet points for

647
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:31.870
being a cunt,
driving dangerously slamming your car and the Lewis Hamilton,

648
00:40:31.871 --> 00:40:34.480
whatever the fuck it is.
He still would,
um,

649
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.020
he's like those people on the highway out here that pass you on the right

650
00:40:38.021 --> 00:40:39.490
through at 90.
He does shit like that.

651
00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:42.340
So if you accrue 12 of those points within a calendar year,

652
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:44.830
you have to sit out a race,
which is devastating,

653
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:48.520
especially if the guy you're going up against wins the race.
He gets 25 points,

654
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:53.290
he's just sitting there on your ass,
you know,
sitting on your helmet.
So anyways,

655
00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:56.680
they said,
gee,
he goes,
I'm explain a few of his weaknesses.
So the report,

656
00:40:56.681 --> 00:40:57.371
it bites and goes,

657
00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:01.840
this is temper one of them and Lewis smiles that goes yes.

658
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.860
Which is the perfect thing you want to do with someone with the temper,
you know,

659
00:41:05.861 --> 00:41:08.890
speaking from experience because all that does this make us more mad and then we

660
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:11.860
fuck up again.
Right.
So then the,
the uh,

661
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.740
the report it goes,
wow,
what's his other weakness?

662
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.730
And Louis just smiles.
It goes,
he's like,
I'll keep that one in my pocket.

663
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:26.320
And he walked away and I was like,
ah,
that was perfect.
Perfect.

664
00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:31.660
Hey.
Um,
but anyways,
like I said,

665
00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:34.370
it was pretty uneventful for the whole,
uh,

666
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.500
<v 1>everybody just cruising around the fucking track,</v>

667
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.720
no big crashes after that turn one and uh,

668
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.930
<v 3>dump the fucking American team.
The Huston was up front for like two laps.</v>

669
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:48.880
Hey know they gave us a little pat on the head.

670
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.540
Like we were still able to hold off to Ferrari's for the first three laps of a

671
00:41:52.541 --> 00:41:54.880
71 lap race.
And as an American,

672
00:41:54.881 --> 00:41:59.300
I'm supposed to be excited by that is we have the Ferrari junior engine or

673
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:00.640
whatever the fuck they give us.

674
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:03.970
<v 1>Um,
so anyways,
the uh,</v>

675
00:42:03.971 --> 00:42:07.690
the final like six laps,
Rick,
uh,
um,

676
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:08.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

677
00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.230
<v 3>Lewis Hamilton was right on fucking Ricardo's ass.</v>

678
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.420
The tires are all fucking chewed up.

679
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.750
I was convinced Hamilton was going to catch him.
Ricardo was able to hold off,

680
00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.490
hold them off,
and then a Sebastian Vettel was right on botox his ass.
Once again,

681
00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:24.310
no passes were made,
but it was still fucking excited.

682
00:42:24.311 --> 00:42:27.640
The last six laps of the race was great and that track was fucking cool as hell,

683
00:42:27.641 --> 00:42:28.474
man.

684
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

685
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.550
<v 1>I love how you said,
it starts like uphill.
Bit Bizarre.</v>

686
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.390
I don't mind.
Was seeing a track laid out like that and it's in the,
uh,

687
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:42.340
the Austrian Alps.
How do you not fucking go to that?

688
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:43.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

689
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.320
<v 1>Swing buy Hitler's house.</v>

690
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.040
You go to the f one race and then you get yourself Savine or Schnitzel.

691
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.053
How do you not,

692
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:54.140
how do you not do that fucking trifective that's a bucket list thing right there

693
00:42:54.141 --> 00:42:55.760
before they tear it down.

694
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:03.930
I mean,
I was always a fan of the Allman,
always all those horror movies,

695
00:43:03.931 --> 00:43:05.220
those demon babies.

696
00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.570
How do you not fucking go there and just be like,

697
00:43:09.571 --> 00:43:11.520
he fucking learn how to walk in that house.

698
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.900
It's just fascinating.

699
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.240
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

700
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.880
<v 1>Like the first time he lost his temper was in that house.</v>

701
00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.680
First Time he realized he had an,
he could draw.

702
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.160
I don't know how long he fuck it stayed there.
It's just eerie.

703
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.100
You know what I mean?
Look,
if universal studios,

704
00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:35.550
if he could take the tour over there and they still have the fucking,
uh,

705
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:40.530
the cycle house,
you know,
cause everyone just wants to look at that.

706
00:43:40.531 --> 00:43:44.340
This is a real life fucking psycho.

707
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.020
Hey,
shouldn't be glorified.
I'm not glorifying it.

708
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:53.610
It's the same reason why I want to see a great white shark from a boat.

709
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:55.803
<v 0>You know,</v>

710
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.660
<v 1>I don't fucking,
this is so,
and as much as everybody fucking bitches,</v>

711
00:43:59.661 --> 00:44:01.490
there's no way.
If you walked down the street,
you called,

712
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:05.460
you couldn't fucking look at it.
You couldn't feel that,
that fucking vibe,

713
00:44:05.461 --> 00:44:09.050
but evil war coming off the side of the fucking house.

714
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.430
<v 3>Oh,
they'd probably be right.
They should probably tear the fucking thing down.</v>

715
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:15.973
<v 0>You know,</v>

716
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.110
<v 1>I was like,
why am I talking about Hitler's house?
Can somebody explain it to me?</v>

717
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.990
So anyways,
the race ends,
I shut it off.

718
00:44:23.991 --> 00:44:27.960
Or coming here to go do the podcast and um,

719
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:29.240
<v 0>yeah,</v>

720
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.040
<v 1>I ended up,
uh,
as when I shut off the race,</v>

721
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.170
<v 3>this is woman was short hair,
you know,</v>

722
00:44:36.171 --> 00:44:38.690
she's got the fucking,
uh,
they hit same hair cut at one.

723
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:43.100
Who's the girl come in at?
So you better get the party started.

724
00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.590
<v 0>Amber,
that pink</v>

725
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:53.470
<v 3>right.
He had the pig haircut and she's sitting there talking to this guy and I'm</v>

726
00:44:53.471 --> 00:44:55.990
looking at it like,
this looks like a fucking therapy session.

727
00:44:55.991 --> 00:44:59.800
What's going on here?
And the show was called the therapist

728
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.200
and they then,
and I'm,
and she's sitting there,
it's Katy Perry

729
00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.313
<v 0>talking</v>

730
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.160
<v 3>I about herself in like,
yeah.</v>

731
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.780
<v 9>You know,
some people like</v>

732
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:15.540
<v 0>okay</v>

733
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.940
<v 9>zoning,
all Eichler hair short hair.</v>

734
00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.800
<v 3>Got It.
And I'm just sitting there thinking,
why are you doing this</v>

735
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.330
sweetheart?
He should do this in private.

736
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.960
Why would you put all this shit out of it?
And she going nuts.

737
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:32.970
But as much you know her,

738
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:36.090
I felt bad for it cause it's just like she's fucking obviously going through

739
00:45:36.091 --> 00:45:40.320
some shit but deck did dig fucking therapist guy.

740
00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:46.460
They got this whole intro and he's like walking through doors and shit like I'm

741
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.040
sure we'd say and I'm a licensed fucking therapist.

742
00:45:49.041 --> 00:45:51.290
You're a fucking money grubbing

743
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.420
acting like you tried to help Katy Perry had a shut it off.

744
00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.630
I had to shut it off.
I rewound it cause I had to find the,
the,

745
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:03.920
the name of the fucking show.
And then I had the fucking walk away.

746
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.740
Jesus Christ,
Katy Perry,
if you need therapy,
go to a fucking therapist.

747
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:14.120
Close the fucking door.
Whoever's shut off her phone,

748
00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.720
get it out.
And I hope you get better.
You don't fucking do it on TV.

749
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.230
Do you realize what you're doing?

750
00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.790
You're letting the world know what hurts you.

751
00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:30.400
And you're on the internet or you want to your fucking mind,

752
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:37.120
these are my weaknesses and every fucking asshole on the internet,

753
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:41.450
it's going to be coming after you.
It's a bad move.

754
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.830
That is not a good move.
And like dead licensed therapist air quote,

755
00:46:45.831 --> 00:46:46.730
fucking that guy.

756
00:46:46.731 --> 00:46:50.640
That guy should be disbarred that you would do fucking exploit something like

757
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.530
that.
But you know what,
the end of the day,

758
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.210
I mean it was probably hurt people's idea.

759
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.520
She greenlit it and then they had to find,

760
00:46:56.521 --> 00:47:01.521
they had a find a therapist low enough on the rung with enough TV presence that

761
00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:04.290
would fucking agree to do that Gig.

762
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.450
I'm trying to think of the standup equivalent to that.

763
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:10.190
A televised,
you know what it would be?

764
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.760
It'd be like those fucking gigs at beyond say and all those guys do full like

765
00:47:13.761 --> 00:47:16.130
fucking new year's.
They go out,

766
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.920
they sneak out of the country and they'd go do like fuck.

767
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:24.530
And they sing bootylicious for like 5 million bucks to the son of a fucking

768
00:47:24.531 --> 00:47:28.550
dictator,
you know,
in some country that were at odds with,

769
00:47:28.551 --> 00:47:32.500
I guess like the TV version of it.
Maybe,
I don't know who the fuck knows,

770
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:34.210
speaking and all that shit.

771
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:37.570
Did you see what Trump went to Russia and he bed flicking Vladimir Putin.

772
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:41.160
Do you see that?
That was fucking hilarious.
You know what?

773
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.480
That's when they fucking was shooting the shit.

774
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.920
It reminded me a Jimmy the gent and have to look the left Swansea high silver.

775
00:47:47.921 --> 00:47:52.110
The fuck you said when Trump walked in,
Putin should have been like command.

776
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.890
Yo come here.

777
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:58.891
Yo Love Swan's a loved,

778
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.680
how do you say l u f t h Lufthansa.

779
00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.360
Heist moral.
I don't fucking know.
Um,

780
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.790
anyways.
Oh,
by the way,
uh,
rest in peace.

781
00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:17.540
Great trauma passed away about four days ago.
Jonathon Blackwell,
who uh,

782
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.440
absolutely killed it with prince,
new power generation,

783
00:48:21.441 --> 00:48:25.430
playboy and Justin Timberlake's big,
I think his first album.
Uh,
that tour,

784
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:28.280
was it?
Blood sugar,
sex magic.

785
00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:33.281
I can never win sexy back tour and I'm stomping on a disco ball.

786
00:48:33.591 --> 00:48:38.240
Whatever the fuck it was called.
I can't keep him.
I actually own the album too.

787
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:42.380
That's the sad thing.
Wham,
Wham,
wham,

788
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.370
wham,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.

789
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.850
A and sexy back bear.

790
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:55.510
And what's that other one?
The other one,

791
00:48:55.511 --> 00:49:00.270
I always get the words wrong.
And Neil always laugh.
What does that one,

792
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.153
uh,

793
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:09.640
though I always think he says dirty bitch that I let you with me.

794
00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:13.750
If you misbehave,
I would say he's going dirty bitch.

795
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.810
He always laughs go.
He's not saying dirty bitch

796
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.100
and I just,
I go,
what's he saying?
She goes a dirty babe or something like that,

797
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.060
you know,
is the hardest one to fucking understand.
Is that a Rihanna?

798
00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.090
She got the accent and she doesn't,
uh,

799
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:37.010
she says like the first three letters of every word at the end of a sentence.

800
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.700
What's,
what's our new fuck it hit we,
you know,
me and Nia,

801
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:46.210
well I forget what the fuck we were going,
but we had on like pop radio,
right?

802
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.390
One of the pop stations there,
is that what it's called?
Top 40.

803
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:50.831
And it was hilarious.

804
00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:54.610
Like they played the same 10 songs on the way there and the same 10 songs on the

805
00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:59.380
way back.
Um,
isn't that,
and then any lag,
lag,
lag,

806
00:49:59.381 --> 00:50:04.150
lag,
lag.
It wasn't that one,
but it was the same thing.
It began with a w.

807
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.990
What is going to fucking drive me nuts?
I've got to look it up.
All right,

808
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:11.680

817
00:50:39.061 --> 00:50:41.070
I might have to fucking hit pause here at this point.

818
00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.970
Maybe I can look up the song.
Oh yeah,

824
00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.770
All right.

I'm just,
I'm too fucking old to be looking at this shit.

828
00:51:21.481 --> 00:51:23.760
you got to know when you're too old to be fucking looking at something.

829
00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:27.900
You just walk away.
You know?
Maybe like those fucking,

830
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:31.650
I don't understand why guys over 40 is take those fucking testosterone pills.

831
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:37.060
It's like you finally clear in your head.
You know what I mean?

832
00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.820
You'll finally getting out of the fucking bars.

834
00:51:46.121 --> 00:51:49.240
of order in a brand new drum kit and in the fucking thing up.

835
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:54.170
Then the fucking colossal waste of time that chasing pussy is.

836
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:59.620
You know,

You're a gal over 40

837
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.910
Was it new gen x?

838
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.130
They act like your testosterone dipping is a bad thing.

839
00:52:06.131 --> 00:52:09.010
It's a fucking great thing.
The clouds are finally partic.

840
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.110
Why would you want to take a bottle of that be 18 forever fucking juice?

841
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.240
Jesus Christ.

842
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:22.241
Do you want to go back into the sports bar and shorten up the fucking sporty

843
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:26.960
slash horror themed waitresses,

Granted,</v>

860
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:31.170
I experienced it with an orange Afro.

861
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:34.350
I mean maybe you guys had a better time than I did.
I don't fucking know.

862
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.430

Um,

863
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:42.100

church
in Grand Rapids,
Michigan.

869
00:54:02.561 --> 00:54:04.840
This is one of my favorite fucking places to play.

870
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:10.240
It's a still functioning nondenominational church.

871
00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:14.350
All right.
Which is why they let comedians go in there.

872
00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:18.880
If I ever decide to get back into religion,
um,

873
00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.470
I think I could,
you know what?

874
00:54:20.471 --> 00:54:23.260
I bet I couldn't go to a non denomination one either cause they'd be so busy

875
00:54:23.261 --> 00:54:26.110
patting themselves on the back about how open minded they are.

876
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.950
Just whenever you want to do,
if you want to stay,
stand you on a deal.

877
00:54:29.951 --> 00:54:32.530
And I could have all the Catholic in me going.

878
00:54:32.531 --> 00:54:37.450
There's gotta be some sort of structure.
Um,
what is is a fucking drum circle.

879
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:38.650
Um,

I can't wait to go up there and run my fucking mouth standing on an alter.

885
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.100
You got to go to this.
If you don't see me,

886
00:55:00.101 --> 00:55:04.000
you have to see a show at this place just to see the fucking venue that it has.

887
00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:06.490
An upper deck horse shoe,

888
00:55:06.491 --> 00:55:09.970
upper deck that runs from one side of the altar right down the hall.

889
00:55:09.971 --> 00:55:12.340
All down the side of the fucking,
you know,
the,

890
00:55:12.341 --> 00:55:16.150
the windows there to the back of the church and then comes right back up again

891
00:55:16.151 --> 00:55:18.370
like a horseshoe,
right.

892
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:22.780
Like what they still call Ohio State stadium even though they enclosed it.

893
00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:28.360
Um,
and like the altar is like the new stands that they stuck in there when they

894
00:55:28.361 --> 00:55:30.280
enclosed it.
Um,

895
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.910
so I'll be up there and then I go to New York to do the acting gig.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.980
and then there's another scene where there's somehow explaining,
I dunno,

1131
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.760
pirates or some kind of behave,
Ian legend that,
you know,

1132
01:10:28.761 --> 01:10:31.880
Paul Walker is explaining and then,
um,
what's his name?

1133
01:10:31.881 --> 01:10:34.920
Scott Conn is looking at pictures and he's like,
I love Scott.

1134
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:39.410
So this is snoop dog here and these are all his hose and this is pimp cup and

1135
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:42.560
Blah,
blah,
blah.
And it's like,
really?
He used to be in a rap group.

1136
01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:43.760
He knows the terminology.

1137
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:48.110
You know what was c eight mile that was based on him and it was based on m and
M.

1138
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:51.620
And I'm not even one of those white guys.
Scott Conn in a rap group.

1139
01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:55.390
Like I'm just not even no less.
I don't even want to talk about that.
Got Econ.

1140
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.200
Scotty gone.
Oh,

1141
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:02.510
did he scratch to that?
Right.
He came out.

1142
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:07.580
Oh my God.
It's ridiculous.

1143
01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:12.500
The one
thing that I liked about that movie,

1144
01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.880
I can't believe we actually watched the whole thing,

1145
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:18.260
but there was a scene and I enjoyed it.
It was so good.

1146
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:21.240
Scott Kahn and Paul Walker are talking about the like,

1147
01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.500
what are we going to do man?

1148
01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:25.560
And the underwater holding their breath at the same time or they're above

1149
01:11:25.561 --> 01:11:29.550
hunching shirts.
They're on land and it's daytime as they're talking.

1150
01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:32.580
And the camera slowly pans around them like really slow.

1151
01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:37.050
And by the time it's done,
the son has said,
and it was a really beautiful shot.

1152
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:39.630
Other than that,
that movie can go kick rocks,

1153
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.843
<v 1>right?</v>

1154
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:45.050
Oh that's cause you're holding the baby kick rock and kick rocks said the f word

1155
01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:47.060
in front of her.
We're really trying not to do that.

1156
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:54.420
<v 8>But that movie was ridiculous and I really upset at that line.</v>

1157
01:11:54.421 --> 01:11:57.870
It still bothers me.
I gotta go,

1158
01:11:57.871 --> 01:12:02.040
my baby Momma needs a new week.
They deal under water for 15 minutes.

1159
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.220
Like I can suspend my disbelief on that.

1160
01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:07.650
That wasn't something that I can just say it.
I mean if the update,

1161
01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:11.190
if you're going to handle why excuses for this,
that line in that movie,

1162
01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.180
why are you making,
I meditate now has to do with anything.

1163
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:19.620
I'm learning to have patients,
patients with why?
With just people's behavior.

1164
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:23.010
While you lucky that you have that ability to do that.

1165
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.040
I was very offended and annoyed.

1166
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:30.330
<v 1>No,
I'm just saying that like if they could give them that line,
not to me.</v>

1167
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:31.650
I'm white.
What?

1168
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:36.630
<v 8>I'm not asking about you as a white [inaudible] my head.</v>

1169
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:39.600
I'm just saying they didn't get it.
I'm telling you what it is.

1170
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:42.270
So why are you sitting here acting brand new like you don't understand what I'm

1171
01:12:42.271 --> 01:12:47.010
talking about the,
I'm just trying to be fit some point it has no funny.

1172
01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:50.790
Well,
I know it's a ridiculous fucking line,

1173
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:53.640
but I've got to keep the comedy going.
This isn't counterpoint a coin.

1174
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:58.200
Counterpoint.
What is it?
That point counter point.
You got to mourn for a host.

1175
01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:02.400
Keep the funny for the love of God.
Please.
Let's not lose the funny,

1176
01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:06.560
God forbid you actually agree with me on some shit and try not to on you pitched

1177
01:13:06.561 --> 01:13:10.770
this show dear white people for me.
Good Lord.
I got it.
It's fucking offensive.

1178
01:13:10.771 --> 01:13:14.910
I'm agreeing with you.
I'm trying to fucking keep it funny on some level.
Fine.

1179
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:16.920
I'm trying to,
I'm just playing the ignorant white guy.

1180
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:18.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1181
01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:20.310
<v 8>You don't have to play at anything.
Nia.</v>

1182
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:26.600
I'm the one who said the line first I was,
I was laying there I go,

1183
01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.630
I gotta get my baby Mama.
We've terrible.

1184
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.180
<v 1>It's terrible writing.
I mean the whole we went to fuck.
It's offensive.</v>

1185
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:36.540
It's fucking people jumping or they're walking around all naked looking good,

1186
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:38.370
holding their breath for fucking four hours.

1187
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:42.600
Do you honestly think that they're gonna have Maya Angelou was one of those

1188
01:13:42.601 --> 01:13:47.320
people and then fucking heads.
Is that the right reference?
Sure.

1189
01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:51.670
All right.
What else you got?
I don't know.
Okay.
Norway.
When?

1190
01:13:51.671 --> 01:13:54.060
When are you on this power,
by the way?
You know what?
I'm stupid.

1191
01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:57.000
It was when I was imitating Jessica Alba doing lines and like,
eh,

1192
01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.820
like she's dumb.
She's got a billion dollar fucking company.

1193
01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:04.290
Where do I get off saying that?
Although my podcast is doing pretty well,

1194
01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:06.780
go on Itunes,
right?
Norway when

1195
01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:09.560
<v 8>coming in Norway,
man,
we love it.</v>

1196
01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.040
We would love it and we it before we end

1197
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.730
<v 1>up like Sweden,
have a nice weekend and go fuck yourself now you,</v>

1198
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:20.490
we traveled.
You know what that means before we end up like Sweden.
Yeah.

1199
01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.400
You know what that means?

1200
01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:25.210
I don't know what you don't remember when they said Sweden,
Sweden,
you still,

1201
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:30.190
you know Sweden remain neutral during World War II.
Okay,
okay.

1202
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.940
And they look the other way and they allowed the Nazis to use their train system

1203
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:38.410
to go on a no way in fuck Norway up.
Is that what's going to happen to know?
Oh,

1204
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.250
okay.

1205
01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:44.250
Norway had bright before the war regained the lower third of their comfort

1206
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:47.140
country from Sweden.
As soon he was like,
whatever,

1207
01:14:47.141 --> 01:14:49.840
we didn't want it any ways or whatever.
Right.
So then they,

1208
01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:53.890
during in World War Two,
Sweden remained neutral.
Okay.

1209
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:57.100
Let the Nazis go through the Nazis fucked up.
Norway.

1210
01:14:57.550 --> 01:15:00.460
Sweden became a power after World War II,

1211
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.610
just simply for the fact that their cities were still standing and they could

1212
01:15:03.611 --> 01:15:07.240
function function in like a,
in a business capacity.
Jesus,

1213
01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:11.740
I'm using some pretty impressive words to me,
right?
So long story short,

1214
01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:14.140
Norway ends up finding in no way didn't offer any,

1215
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:16.480
I mean Sweden off front knowing and you're helping me and stuff.

1216
01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:17.710
Long story short.
No.

1217
01:15:17.711 --> 01:15:20.110
Ended up discovering all this oil and that land that they got back,

1218
01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:24.820
I believe or northern that now they're making so much money over there.

1219
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.370
Nobody wants to do like lower level jobs.

1220
01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:30.430
So Swedes come in and do the jobs Norwegians don't want to do.

1221
01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:34.150
You don't remember the Norwegian saying,
Oh the Swedish people saying,
yeah,

1222
01:15:34.151 --> 01:15:36.460
we're like the Mexicans for Norwegians.

1223
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:41.150
<v 8>Wow.
Okay.
You don't remember that?
No,
I don't remember that at all.</v>

1224
01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.790
When would I ever went to,
was that when the guy said it to us?

1225
01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:47.720
We thought it would the Norwegian guy,
when we were in Norway,

1226
01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.570
I gotta be honest with you and you're probably going to jump all over me.

1227
01:15:50.571 --> 01:15:53.780
But when we did Norway,
Finland and Sweden,

1228
01:15:53.781 --> 01:15:57.410
like I honestly can't,
I don't know.

1229
01:15:57.411 --> 01:16:01.940
I don't recall which was which country.
Cause it looked the same.
You realize?

1230
01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:06.560
Do you realize,
no,
don't try to cover your tracks.
Don't try to cover your tracks.

1231
01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:11.561
Do you realize if you took them to follow Rwanda fucking a Honda apple door and

1232
01:16:13.431 --> 01:16:16.730
a,
what is the other one over there?
You took me three African countries,
right?

1233
01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.120
The Gambia,
Gambia,
Africa,
South Africa,

1234
01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:23.620
and then we went to Rwanda was like gay.
You know what to be honest with Ya,
Ya,

1235
01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.850
Ya.
I know what you're saying.
There's a bunch of blue eyed,

1236
01:16:25.851 --> 01:16:28.340
blonde haired white people.
It looked the same.
Norway,

1237
01:16:28.341 --> 01:16:31.580
Finland and what was the other one we went to?
What was the other one?

1238
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:36.020
I wouldn't go.
I want go,
you know much a plane ticket cost.
Me Sweden.
I love cars.

1239
01:16:36.021 --> 01:16:38.720
I love Stockholm.
But what were the other three?
I don't know.

1240
01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:42.920
Why don't you go get a fucking globe and Spin it around a couple times to figure

1241
01:16:42.921 --> 01:16:45.500
it out.
I can't remember which country was which.

1242
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.870
I always wanted to travel as a little girl.
Hey,

1243
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.730
here's three F it was off where we had that crazy meal that like 10 course meal,

1244
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:56.960
like the never ending with the cheese at the end with that Norway.
Oh,

1245
01:16:57.350 --> 01:17:01.310
why don't you serve out to Calabasas and knock on the Kardashians door right
now?

1246
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:03.290
Why don't you just do that and just fit in with them?

1247
01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.010
What does anything that I'm saying I have to do what the card says plays hour.

1248
01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:10.140
I don't waver.
When we ate the cheese

1249
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.460
<v 1>number.
What?
Finland versus Norway,
like what we did,</v>

1250
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:16.970
because they were geographically very similar.
All right.
I'm going to have to do,

1251
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:21.620
I'm gonna have to remind you of these places in a way that your little travel

1252
01:17:21.621 --> 01:17:25.490
brain,
little travel brand,
remember.
Okay.
All right.

1253
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.450
Finland was where you've got the coat.
Yes.
Okay.

1254
01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:34.290
I remember now you remember that?
Norway's where you got the cheese?
Yeah.

1255
01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:38.060
Okay,
great.
Stockholm you loved,
so you remember that.
They go,

1256
01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:42.500
that's the difference.
Yeah.
So Finland is the coat country.
Got It all.

1257
01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:47.270
Slows the cheese.
The meal.
Yeah.
We had that 200 course meal.
Yep.

1258
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:48.141
And then there was that,

1259
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:51.710
the funkiest cheese ever and I was eating it and you were telling me to stop and

1260
01:17:51.711 --> 01:17:54.620
my eyes were watering and told me to stop.

1261
01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.180
The Maura had to eat it because it was funny to me.
All right.
It was cold.

1262
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.780
I remember it being cold.
Yeah.
All right.

1263
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:08.190
Paris was the place that had the arch,
like in Washington Square Park.
Yes.

1264
01:18:08.191 --> 01:18:12.990
I remember parents,
right?
Restaurant doesn't accept cash,
dear.

1265
01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:17.010
Oh dear Billy.
Red tits restaurant.
And some reason this is backwards.

1266
01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.300
It says restaurant doesn't accept cash dear while.
One word Billy red tits.

1267
01:18:21.301 --> 01:18:24.240
I think it's Billy.
Read Ted's restaurant.
Doesn't dear Billy.
Read Ted.
Sorry.

1268
01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:28.470
The other day I went to a very trended salad place in Hollywood and when I went

1269
01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:31.680
to what I said,
sorry,
trended.
Oh,

1270
01:18:31.681 --> 01:18:35.640
very trendy salad place in Hollywood.
And when I went to pay,

1271
01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:40.080
I held out a $20 bill and the cashier said,
sorry,
we don't accept cash.

1272
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:43.260
That's the most ridiculous thing.
Have you heard this before?
Yeah,

1273
01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:47.040
I'm like trains,
planes and shit.
Planes.
I don't think they do.

1274
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:50.820
What do you think we have?
What?
They're working towards a cashless society.

1275
01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.670
We're all going to be microchipped and that's going to be it.

1276
01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.700
And right when they gain control of all human society,

1277
01:18:56.701 --> 01:19:00.180
the robots are gonna take over.
All right.
Lastly,

1278
01:19:00.181 --> 01:19:02.010
but not leastly the last question here,

1279
01:19:02.011 --> 01:19:07.011
girlfriend wants me to call her daddy during sex isn't no one.

1280
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:07.801
Uh,
hey bill.

1281
01:19:07.801 --> 01:19:11.550
I just started seeing this girl we'd been dating for about two to three weeks.

1282
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:13.290
She's smart,
attractive.

1283
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:17.790
Everybody says this career driven and generally speaking has her shit together.

1284
01:19:17.791 --> 01:19:22.200
She seems like a girl.
She was like a girl that you seems like a girl.

1285
01:19:22.201 --> 01:19:22.891
As far as I can tell,

1286
01:19:22.891 --> 01:19:25.640
she's got all the lady parts that I could see myself having a longterm

1287
01:19:25.650 --> 01:19:29.370
relationship with.
However,
recently when we were having sex,
sex,

1288
01:19:29.371 --> 01:19:32.370
she insisted on calling me daddy.

1289
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.200
I've never been the type to talk dirty.
Oh,
oh.
I say,
okay,
I get it.

1290
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.920
Oh,
okay.
I thought it was the other way around.
I thought she wanted you to,

1291
01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.280
okay.
I get it.
Okay.
Okay.
I see that.
All right.
Well that's pretty pedestrian,

1292
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.490
however,
recently about put up at the,

1293
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:56.120
I've never been the type to talk dirty because it seems kind of silly and takes

1294
01:19:56.121 --> 01:19:57.920
me out of the moment.
Yeah,
you guys are not compatible.

1295
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:01.430
If she's gonna want to sale is filthy crazy over the top shit and you're going

1296
01:20:01.431 --> 01:20:06.360
to be like,
oh,
oh,
oh,
like in your fucking cheat,

1297
01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:09.030
whatever the fuck you're doing.
You know which neither one of you are wrong.

1298
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:12.420
I don't know if you're compatible here.
When she started calling me Daddy,

1299
01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:16.080
I was caught off guard but tried to play through it because I didn't want to

1300
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:18.550
make her feel weird when you're a good person then,
alright,

1301
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.750
now even attempted to throw in my own lines like,
oh yeah,
you liked it.

1302
01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:23.670
But afterwards,
after the words left my mouth,

1303
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:27.840
I had to try not to laugh because it felt like I was in a cheesy porno and it

1304
01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:30.690
started to affect my performance.
Um,

1305
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:33.570
afterwards she asked me how I felt about it and I just brushed it off like it

1306
01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:36.030
wasn't a problem.
But on the inside I was starting to have my doubts.

1307
01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:40.110
I'm trying to paint a picture without giving too much detail because I know you

1308
01:20:40.111 --> 01:20:41.460
get all the Weirdos.

1309
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:42.800
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1310
01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.050
<v 1>You get all weirded out by shit,
but I don't know.</v>

1311
01:20:45.051 --> 01:20:48.020
I don't get weeded out by a lot of shit.
Uh,

1312
01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.300
is it weird that she likes me to call her daddy?

1313
01:20:50.301 --> 01:20:53.390
Am I walking into a relationship with underlying daddy issues?
Helped me out.

1314
01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:56.510
Bill,
what should I do?
Oh,
I get to be doctor bill.

1315
01:20:57.030 --> 01:21:01.660
<v 11>Oh,
I'm so weird.
He's having sex with you.
Oh,</v>

1316
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:05.420
she wants you to call her daddy.

1317
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:07.910
<v 1>This is our doctor.
Phil would handle it.</v>

1318
01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:11.370
<v 11>Well.
Um,
most of our fan base is female.</v>

1319
01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:14.610
So you're the male and you're therefore always wrong.

1320
01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.500
<v 1>Um,
no,
I would definitely bring it up to her.</v>

1321
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:21.091
I would bring it up to,

1322
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:24.300
it's difficult to bring up something like that with somebody,

1323
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:27.150
but if it bothers you,
you got to bring it up.
I would bring him,
just say,
listen,

1324
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.140
um,
I'm not judging you or anything like that,

1325
01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:35.070
but for me,
you gotta,
you gotta keep an eye on you,

1326
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:39.950
your side of the bed.
It just feels weird.
No,

1327
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.793
how do you say it?

1328
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:46.200
I don't feel comfortable having you call me daddy in bed.

1329
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:51.180
It just,
it makes just say uncomfortable.
Don't say weird.

1330
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:57.490
Hey Nia,
I need your help.

1331
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:05.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1332
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:09.670
<v 1>Oh yeah.
Yeah,
keep coming.
I got the blue in the other room.
All right.
This guy,</v>

1333
01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.940
this guy's with this girl.
He thinks she's great and everything she wants.

1334
01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:16.510
She wants him to call.

1335
01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:20.800
She wants to call him daddy during sex and it weirds him out.

1336
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:25.270
How does he bring it up without making her feel like she's got a fucking
problem?

1337
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:27.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1338
01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:30.120
<v 8>I don't want you to call me daddy during sex because it makes me uncomfortable.</v>

1339
01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1340
01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:35.170
<v 8>I don't think it's wrong.
I'm not judging you,
but just for me.
For me,</v>

1341
01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:41.290
that was perfect.
Yeah,
just be honest.
There you go.
But just say,

1342
01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:42.370
I'm not trying to judge you.

1343
01:22:42.371 --> 01:22:45.460
I don't think you're a weird cause I know a lot of people do it cause a lot of

1344
01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.680
people do deal with it,
but just I,

1345
01:22:47.681 --> 01:22:51.610
it makes me uncomfortable and I'm not ready to go there just yet.

1346
01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:56.260
Can we come up with something else?
Luckily went different language.

1347
01:22:56.261 --> 01:22:57.700
Like I pop papi.
Yeah.

1348
01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:01.980
Well you just picture some,

1349
01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.800
<v 1>wait me random language.
Uh,</v>

1350
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:09.340
I is German random enough now.
You don't have to go there and extend them.

1351
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:13.920
She's taking a shit on your chest.
I don't know buddy.
You got a uh,
yeah.

1352
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:16.720
However Nia just said.
That's perfect.
All right,

1353
01:23:16.721 --> 01:23:19.420
I'm going to wrap up the podcast here.
All right,
that's the podcast.
Everybody.

1354
01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:21.760
Thank you for listening.
Thank you guys.

1355
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:24.040
Once again for watching efforts for family.
We got,
I don't know,

1356
01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:25.900
you never know what the fuck ratings you get on Netflix,

1357
01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:30.400
but they gave us another season,
so there you go.
Um,
I really appreciate it.

1358
01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:31.570
That's it.
Um,

1359
01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.100
please come out and see me and Dean del Ray at the Fountain Street Church.

1360
01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:40.420
Grand rapids added a third show.
Tickets are hopefully going fast,

1361
01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.790
but hopefully there's some left so you can get him,

1362
01:23:42.791 --> 01:23:45.460
cause I'm saying that some left.
All right.
That's it.

1363
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.430
I'll talk to you and check in on you on Thursday.
Bye.
