WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.400
Okay.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.350
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.720
April fucking seventh.
What's going on?
How are you,

4
00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.370
I apologize for the,
uh,
the bad sound on the recording.

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.470
Um,
I am right now,
I am overseas.
I am in Gay Patty.

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.090
I don't mean that in a homophobic way.
Um,

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.450
I was just what they call it.
I think gay still means happy over here.

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.970
It used to mean happy and,
uh,

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.560
United States of America before gay people stole that word,
you know?

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.090
And then started telling people how they can use it,
how they can't use it.

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.310
It doesn't make any sense to me.
You don't know the word
anyways.
Um,

12
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.260
<v 2>I mean,
how come stupid,
you know,</v>

13
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:58.150
how come dope and stupid could actually meet something good?
Right?

14
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.490
What'd you gay can't meet?
That's leg,
I guess because it's,
it's,

15
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:08.080
it's coming from gay meeting,
uh,
same sex.

16
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.640
I don't know.
I've never understood it.
I could say like,
you know,

17
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:17.641
that that fucking band is dig gay meaning lane and still not care if gay people

18
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.260
get married.
Why?

19
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.850
Why does everybody have to be a fucking parent right now?

20
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.030
And just say what you can say and what you can't say.

21
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.510
It doesn't make a difference.
What the fuck you say?
It's what's in your fucking

22
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.933
right.

23
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.950
All you're doing is you're just given a roadmap for psychos on how to get

24
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.550
through the minefield without showing the hand,
you know,

25
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.680
and that's how you end up with another Hitler.
I'm joking.

26
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.750
Maybe a mousseline you though.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna try not to move the car

27
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.660
<v 1>jewelry had,
the reason why I'm recording this way is because,
uh,</v>

28
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.960
I finally figured it out after two times being over here or overseas.

29
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.920
I think I was in Australia one time and I've blown out my fucking mixer,

30
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.630
mixer.
Uh,
what I figured out over here for you,
you people,

31
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.430
my countrymen in the states,
uh,

32
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.530
do not plug anything with two only two prongs into a fucking wall over here.

33
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.320
My experiences it,

34
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.410
it either blows out the plug that's the best case scenario or just completely

35
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.280
damages and fucks over whatever device you were trying to put in.

36
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:34.600
I've lost two mixers.

37
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.260
I tried to plug my iPhone in and I'm saying this is with an adapter to um,

38
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.760
I didn't just stick it on a wall.
I actually used an adapter and uh,

39
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.770
I did that with my,
uh,

40
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.990
my iPhone charger for the four s and think fucking blew up.

41
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.680
I should have known because I was charging it earlier and it was working fine

42
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:00.040
and when I pulled it onto the wall was really hot.

43
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.320
Now I don't understand electricity.

44
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:07.321
To me it's still magic and you somehow trapped lightening and put it in the

45
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:12.300
wall.
That's what electricity is to me.

46
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.520
It's lightning,
you know,

47
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.920
cause my only education about it was when all fat.

48
00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:22.470
So with his male pattern baldness in his fucking,

49
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:27.030
that glasses flew the kite down there in Philly,
you know,

50
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.110
any went out there and he was all hammered because a,

51
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:35.830
he was making excuses for his alcoholism.
Isn't that what he did?
He said yeah,

52
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.200
beer is proof that God loves us.

53
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.080
Yeah.
What else fills the old man?

54
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.740
He must have been coming down the street with his giant Mug.

55
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.720
I Bet Ben Franklin was the first one to have like a personalized mug at a bar or

56
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:56.721
something like the first norm from cheers as he comes stumbling in this stupid

57
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.380
swearing.

58
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.060
Witticisms witticisms witticisms however the fuck you say it.
I Dunno.

59
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.590
Um,
anyways,
so yeah,
I'm over here on vacation.

60
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.960
Finally took a vacation.

61
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:12.270
I've always wanted to come here and why the fuck not right?

62
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.210
What else am I going to do?
Huh?
Go to fucking Santa Fe.

63
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.290
Uh,
no,

64
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.720
I've always wanted to come here and it has been absolutely incredible and I did

65
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:28.140
not brush up on my French whatsoever.
I mean,

66
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.780
there wasn't really anything to brush up on.

67
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.670
I like how I just said that as if I was at one point semi fluent in the
language.

68
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.870
I wasn't,

69
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.870
I will tell you that I took it from sixth grade to 12th grade and I never

70
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:47.160
progressed past French one.
And I'm actually,
I did,

71
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:51.300
I got the French two way and I did so poorly.
My Dad suggested,

72
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:54.840
why don't you go back to French one and start over again and get the basics?

73
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.570
And I was like,
all right,
that sounds like a good idea.

74
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:01.680
And in theory it was a good idea cause I still had my junior and senior years to

75
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:05.940
get through French two and have my two years of a language,

76
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.800
you know,
because that was a big thing when I went to,
when I went to high school,

77
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:13.140
you have to have two years of language.

78
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.390
If you don't have two years of a language,

79
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.410
you're not going to be able to get into any college worth anything.

80
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.760
In the United States of America of course,
turned out to be complete horse shit.

81
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.100
All you have to do with you fuck up in high school is go to any college that you

82
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:30.870
want to go to and just say,
listen,

83
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:35.460
can I just start taking courses to prove that I can exist if this academic
level?

84
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.480
And then the head is,
they just think,
yeah,
we'll take your money.
Stupid.

85
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.150
We'll take it.
Go ahead.
Thanks for a couple of classes.

86
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.160
Flunk out and we got your money.
You dumb fuck.
But if you actually hang in there,

87
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.830
eventually they have to accept you.

88
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.810
That's the other way to get into a big school.
You know,
me personally,

89
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:56.070
I think what you should really do,

90
00:05:56.071 --> 00:06:01.071
if you want to say some fucking money and you weren't born daddy Warbucks I

91
00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:04.670
don't even know if that's the right reference.
I've never seen.

92
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.180
And I thought the whole thing was offensive.

93
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.190
I didn't like how Andy looked exactly how I looked when I was a child in the 70s

94
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.570
and that they then made it a woman.
I took it as a personal attack.

95
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:20.590
But that's a whole other fucking story.
Um,

96
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.950
anyways,
if you weren't born into a rich family,

97
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:28.530
what you really want to do is go to a,

98
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.410
go to a community college for your first two years.
What's that like?

99
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.070
700 bucks a year or semester or whatever the fuck it is.

100
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.070
You're not that out.
This half you fucking college education,
bing,
Bang,
boom.

101
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.340
You haven't been,
you haven't had to pay shit.
And then you get,

102
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400
and then you transfer to a bigger school in the better school and then you only

103
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.600
have to pay two years.
And you know what the end of it,

104
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:57.860
you've got the same degree hanging on the fucking walls,
the other jerk off.
Um,

105
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.170
but anyways,
anyways,
back to being hammered France.
Uh,

106
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.280
so what I've been doing is I've been going onto this duo lingo

107
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.010
website and I gotta tell you it's been phenomenal and I've been over here in

108
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:15.530
Paris having conversations,
you know,

109
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.040
basic conversations in French with these Parisian who I told were unbelievably

110
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:26.450
rude and to just speak English to them cause they hate when you try and speak

111
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:31.451
French and they'll roll their eyes and you'll try to talk to them in English and

112
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:35.120
they'll leave a stomp away or they'll just speak to you in English,

113
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.910
condescending,
condescending,
condescending,
all of that shit.

114
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.420
I have to tell you my experience,
um,

115
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.210
nothing could be further from the truth.

116
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.460
These people have been ridiculously polite,
that really fucking Nice.

117
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.840
And if you're making an effort to speak their language,

118
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:57.760
they're actually cool with it.
If you just sit there and you're like,
uh,
blah,

119
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.720
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
whatever we go,
do I say that right?

120
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.470
And they'll laugh and they'll just kind of help you along with it.

121
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.410
That's what I find.
I found a couple of impatient people,

122
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:10.720
but you know what the fuck?
Um,
I dunno.

123
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:13.570
I think it Kinda goes back to that,
that same thing like with New Yorkers,

124
00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:17.680
I always heard New Yorkers are rude and pushy and when I moved there I didn't

125
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:20.890
find that I found it to be really friendly.
So,
uh,
either

126
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.120
people are making up shit or I'm fucked up.
One of the other,

127
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.310
it's probably a little bit of both,

128
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.490
but I've been here for about five days and uh,

129
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.150
I can't say enough about the people,
man.
I,
I think they're great.
And um,

130
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.760
the lovely me,

131
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.320
she's unbelievable when it comes to speaking other languages.
She just like,

132
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.533
<v 4>yeah,</v>

133
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.671
<v 1>I swear to God,</v>

134
00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:48.620
I was telling her the other day like she could be like a spy because she'll sit

135
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:52.820
there and she'll start speaking in French and a French is so good that they just

136
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.290
roll with it here and then they start saying

137
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.110
shit and I know via doesn't know what they're talking about,

138
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.620
but she doesn't betray that on a space.

139
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.650
She just sits in the pocket and she watches the body language and their

140
00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:11.890
mannerisms and she picks up on what they're saying.

141
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.920
And then she responds to it with the French that she knows or if she doesn't,

142
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.430
she gives him a smile and then asks them in English is that we are talking about

143
00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:26.010
and they absolutely fucking lover me.

144
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.720
On the other hand,
I've been able to get to,
uh,

145
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.890
I had one cab ride that was entirely in French.

146
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.953
<v 5>MMM.</v>

147
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.330
<v 1>Which like made my whole fucking trip.</v>

148
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.060
I figured this is how you learn the language.
If you ever lived over here,
uh,

149
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.140
how to get,
you know,

150
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.270
have a cab ride in ordering food seems to be the way to go the first time.

151
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:53.170
So I can find to learn all these different,
you know,

152
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.450
words for food in that type of shit over here.
But it's been,
uh,

153
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.550
it's been tremendous.
I've always wanted to come here and I got to tell you,
um,

154
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:06.630
the limited amount of places that I've been to over here or around the world,

155
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:08.050
I should say,
ah,
this is

156
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:15.070
visually the most unbelievable city I've ever been to.
I mean,
uh,

157
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.830
the sons of bitches knew what they were doing when they were laying this thing

158
00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:22.550
out.
It's incredible.
Absolutely incredible.

159
00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:24.800
Like I've been to like,

160
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.590
I think three parks here
are two,

161
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.780
two giant parts here that could fuck with central park.

162
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.570
Well,
and then as big as central park,

163
00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:41.360
they have another one that's as big as central park.

164
00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:43.400
I haven't been to that one yet.
You know,
it's funny,

165
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.970
as I looked it up on the internet and I guess at night that's where the hookers

166
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:47.804
are.

167
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.250
And you know what I gotta tell you they'll,
hookers are pretty fucking gorgeous.

168
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.490
That's another thing too.
Best liquid fucking women.

169
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.330
As far as a country I've ever gone to.

170
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.660
And that includes,
I mean,

171
00:11:05.661 --> 00:11:09.950
this just might be personal tastes as includes Sweden and Norway,

172
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.460
where the women would drop dead gorgeous.
And uh,

173
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.520
Iceland to like the French women at fucking unbelievable plus that speak in

174
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:20.270
French.
You know,

175
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.450
who the hell doesn't like a gorgeous woman speaking French?
You know,
I don't,

176
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.080
maybe you don't,
this is just on my own personal opinions here,

177
00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:32.150
but um,
anyways,

178
00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:35.780
these other two parks at that I've gone to,
um,

179
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.560
the way that they do it,

180
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:41.500
it's like you walk into the park and it's sort of,

181
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.600
you're covered like this trees all around you and that's beautiful enough with

182
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:49.010
park benches and all that.

183
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.303
<v 5>MMM.</v>

184
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.300
<v 1>And then you basically,
I don't know how far,</v>

185
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.440
I don't know how many meters so many yet,
but you get all the way in,

186
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.330
um,
whatever about four or five football fields in.
Once you get in,

187
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:09.390
all of a sudden it just comes to this like giant open area and then you have

188
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:16.471
these 365 degree views of like museums,

189
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.320
old governmental buildings,

190
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.060
or like the Eiffel Tower all of a sudden will just be there like a,

191
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:28.670
like a god Damn Mountain in the distance.
It's,
um,

192
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.390
literally breathtaking,
you know,

193
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.010
and I know you guys are going to trash me for saying that,
but I,

194
00:12:34.011 --> 00:12:38.530
I swear to God it's a,
it's,
I can't say enough about it and,
um,

195
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.110
if I was ever going to live,
I think somewhere else,
I mean,
first of all,

196
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.990
I always wanted to learn to speak another language and also this displaces

197
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:51.991
incredible and I've only seen a little bit of it and I'll tell you about it,

198
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.340
uh,
after,
after these messages here,
I got to do a little bit of advertising here.

199
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.600
I apologize for the click and sound if this is like extra loud,
but like I said,

200
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.850
my fucking mix,
it only has a,

201
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.970
he has the two prongs and I'm not sticking that in the wall because you know I

202
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:11.430
buy like $90 mixer.

203
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.190
So that's another thing too about your devices over here.

204
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:18.880
If you've got something that costs you about a hundred bucks and some sort of

205
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.020
elect piece of electronics,

206
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:22.790
do not plug it into the fucking wolf with or without an adept,

207
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.530
but without an adapter,
it's probably gonna blow up,
um,

208
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.400
as opposed to just getting shorted out the other way.
Okay,
here we go.

209
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.680
I'm stamp stop,

Um,
the post office is always crowded.

210

211
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.730

and what do we got here?
One More Dollar Shave Club.
Everyone.</v>

253
00:15:54.971 --> 00:15:59.740
Nothing feels better than that first shave with a fresh blade,
right?
It's smooth,

254
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:04.270
it's close in.
The blade is as sharp as ever.
Um,

255
00:16:04.271 --> 00:16:08.790
it feels fantastic,
but thanks to the big shapes what?

256
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.020
But thanks to the big shapes companies,
ridiculous prices.
You can't afford,

257
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.970
use a fresh blade every week.
Kenya.

258
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.240
So you drag that Dell last blade across your Frakes phase for two weeks,

259
00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:23.830
three weeks,
10 weeks,
however long,
depending on your cash situation.

260
00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.210
Why would you do that to yourself?

261
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.690
Maybe because the only thing more painful than shaving with an old blade is

262
00:16:28.691 --> 00:16:32.260
shelling out 30 bucks for a pack of new ones.
Um,

263

Um,

291
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.300
I actually got some great feedback on the tour.

292
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:24.420
They did their first date alone down in San Diego.

293
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.260
And here's a review because an email like got a dear William,

294
00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:31.030
I might be your biggest west coast fan.

295
00:18:31.031 --> 00:18:35.410
I saw you on New Year's eve and just checked out the all in show in San Diego

296
00:18:35.411 --> 00:18:39.760
last week.
Wow.
Those guys were hilarious.
Joe,
Jason and Andrew,
Andrew Feminist,

297
00:18:39.761 --> 00:18:42.900
who helps me on the podcast here,
actually came down for the show,
uh,

298
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:47.350
would just as awesome as they worked.
The Wiltern Joe Bart.
Nick is an animal.

299
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:54.220
There's never been a truer thinks that he says,
if that's the way he does comedy,

300
00:18:54.221 --> 00:18:58.080
I hate to see him drunk.
Actually.
You'd love to see him drunk.
A lawyer.

301
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.070
There's a spitfire.
He did a great person,

302
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.080
nation of the guy from bar rescue by request of the other guys on the show.

303
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.950
Oh,
by the way,
we got a video of that.
We've got,
have some video of that.
Uh,

304
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:13.420
Jason Law had,
does a fucking hilarious impression of the bar rescue guy.

305
00:19:13.421 --> 00:19:17.500
We're going to have that up here on the podcast page.
Um,
and he said,

306
00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:22.501
I was quoting Andrew Feminists to my coworkers the next day and now on Diversey.

307
00:19:22.601 --> 00:19:24.400
Holy Shit.
Paul verse.
He's hilarious.

308
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.640
He's the only one of your four horsemen I'd never seen perform.

309
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.270
You don't keep any slob she's around.
I highly recommend your podcasts.

310
00:19:31.271 --> 00:19:35.260
Listeners check out.
There are other shows.
I'd be the water boy.
And this tor to,

311
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.380
I was hoping you were actually a guy in the audience of disguise and you were

312
00:19:38.381 --> 00:19:41.680
going to stand up and rip off your fake mustache and jump up on stage.

313
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.850
Thanks for the podcast and go fuck yourself.
Uh,
there's actually a chance,
um,

314
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.670
then I might pop in on a,
uh,
a show or possibly two on this tour.

315
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.200
You never know,
but just let you know.
Tonight there were helium comedy club,

316
00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.490
Great Comedy Club in Portland,
Oregon.

319
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.060
they're at the punchline in Sacramento,
all very outbreak clubs.

320
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.100
It's an amazing show.
They're all my buddies.

321
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:15.260
I'd love if you had time to go out and support these guys.

322
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.000
The show starts at 8:00 PM.
Um,
see them all on the same bill.

323
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.810
You're going to get to be able to tell your friends that someday.
And uh,
oh.

324
00:20:23.811 --> 00:20:28.280
And also,
um,
Tom Segora,
one of my favorite,
um,

325
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.900
I call them new comedians because I'm an old guy.
And,
um,

326
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.720
he's also one of the members here in the,
uh,
all things comedy network.

327
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.700
He has a new comedy special out his first hour special called completely normal.

328
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.550
It's available if you want to purchase it on iTunes.

329
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:48.310
If you just want to check it out and get them some views on Netflix,

330
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:50.290
you can obviously check it out on Netflix.
All right.

331
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.550
I've done one of my mouth here.
Um,
so back to the,
uh,

332
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.470
back to the tour of here.
Um,

333
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.880
they're just realized I'm wearing headphones and I can't even hear myself.

334
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.370
Not that towards back to the,
uh,
the trip up here in France.

335
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.740
Um,
so yeah,

336
00:21:09.741 --> 00:21:14.741
we got here on a Wednesday of last week and uh,

337
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.450
I got to admit,
I haven't seen,

338
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:23.780
I haven't really done any touristy shit.
Uh,

339
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.790
I just kind of been sitting in cafes,
watching people go and buy,

340
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.320
you know,

341
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.180
eating some great food and I'm riding a bicycle,

342
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.640
riding around like a twinkle toes,
having a good time doing that.
Uh,

343
00:21:40.641 --> 00:21:44.080
walked along the river center.
If you ever get a chance to do that,
um,

344
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.020
you're going to see these stairs that go down where you can get really close to

345
00:21:48.021 --> 00:21:51.950
the river.
Do not,
I repeat,
do not do that.

346
00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.460
Um,
I think that's where everyone in Paris,

347
00:21:55.461 --> 00:21:56.990
when they can't make it to the bathroom,

348
00:21:56.991 --> 00:22:01.991
takes a piss because it literally smells like the Ford Authority down there.

349
00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.800
If you stay up a pie along the road,
it's incredible.

350
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.220
And um,
I don't know.
We've just been having a great time here.

351
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:14.620
I'm trying to get,
getting near to come down here to the podcast.

352
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:18.020
She's still sleeping.
She's got a little bit of jet lag.
Uh,

353
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.231
I don't know.
You know what?

354
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:24.250
I'll hit pause here in a few minutes and I'll actually go into the other room

355
00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:26.620
and see if I can get her,
I apologize if this is too quiet.

356
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.600
Where's she staying in a very quiet building here.
We um,

357
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.400
we rented an apartment here,
which uh,

358
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.490
it's definitely more expensive,
but it's kind of,

359
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.080
you saved money by basically,
you know,
cause then you have a kitchen.

360
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.770
So what you do,
we should just go down the road,
you know,

361
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:52.771
you walk outside and you fucking maybe learn some French words on food.

362
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:55.750
You Go,
where did you go?
Try to have a,
uh,

363
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.310
I tried to go buy your groceries,
all speaking only French.

364
00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.770
I was almost saying old to do it.
I fold it,

365
00:23:02.771 --> 00:23:06.040
I can always pull them for the first couple of words and they kind of figure it

366
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:07.960
out and they slowly start speaking English.

367
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.060
But I kind of just stick with the French,

368
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:13.510
like I'm trying to learn it at that point I just say,

369
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.570
I'll say the English word and then try to say the French word and then just say,

370
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:18.970
is that how you say it?
And then they usually correct me or whatever,

371
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.790
but whatever.
Then you could just bring it back,

372
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:26.620
load up your fridge and I can save a ton of cash that way.

373
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.380
Um,
I dunno.
It's just been amazing.
It's been amazing.

374
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.000
Uh,
I haven't been able to get up early enough to get a fresh baguette.

375
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.700
And,
uh,
I will,

376
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.110
I can tell you that that's something else that I've learned here is nothing,

377
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.470
nothing goes faster than a fucking baguette in the morning,

378
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.760
he's got these people,
like that's one of the true stereotypes.

379
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.150
Like when you see them walking down the street or riding a bicycle with a

380
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.180
Baguette,
these fucking people oriented,
those guys,

381
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:03.700
them sinks and they tried to be the first person in line.
I mean,
do they,
they,

382
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.400
they're gone.
They're fucking gone by.
Like,

383
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:12.380
by the time I get up at like 1130 is probably the earliest segment of getting up

384
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:16.100
around 10 o'clock,
1130 or whatever.
They're just fucking gone.

385
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.850
It's like two or three left.
And,
um,

386
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:26.530
I dunno.
So,
uh,
I already forget the name of bakery.
I say bake.
We out here.

387
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:31.750
Ah,
Shit.
I don't know.
But uh,
Neil,
no,
I keep thinking,

388
00:24:31.751 --> 00:24:36.070
I learned words like left Shin and she'd go,
no,

389
00:24:36.071 --> 00:24:40.000
what does she add?
It's like,
ah,
you know what lifts,
fuck you.
You know,
just,

390
00:24:40.001 --> 00:24:41.230
it's kind of annoying because,
you know what,

391
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.200
it actually kind of got pissed a couple of times when she did that to me cause I

392
00:24:44.201 --> 00:24:47.250
felt like I was back in French class.
It's like,

393
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.410
am I ever going to get this shit down?
Um,
so anyways,

394
00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:52.150
as I mentioned that we haven't seen,

395
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.160
the only touristy things that I've seen is I've just stood and looked at him

396
00:24:57.161 --> 00:25:00.620
like the Notradame I basically,

397
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.603
<v 5>uh,</v>

398
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.310
<v 1>one day this is a great city to get lost into because you just use the river as</v>

399
00:25:07.311 --> 00:25:08.144
you guide.

400
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:09.703
<v 5>MMM.</v>

401
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.520
<v 1>I just kind of go in about five,
10,
20 blocks,</v>

402
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.450
although you can get lost because of river sort of white river sand kind of

403
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:19.100
winds down the middle of it.
But it's,

404
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:22.550
it's been a pretty good way to try to figure out where the hell you're at.

405
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.233
<v 5>MMM.</v>

406
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
<v 1>But like I walked by the military and it was beautiful and everything,</v>

407
00:25:30.191 --> 00:25:31.690
but I'm not a big religious guy.

408
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:36.520
And then I saw the line of people outside of it and I just laughed like,

409
00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.570
why the fuck?

410
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.260
I understand if you have kids and you're trying to teach them something,

411
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.930
but if you're a fucking adult and you're on vacation,

412
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.130
there's no reason to ever stand in the line.
You're on vacation.

413
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.600
Why would you do that to yourself?

414
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:52.543
<v 5>You know,</v>

415
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:58.600
<v 1>we were sitting there,
I was trying to find the,
the trials and uh,
I,
I,</v>

416
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.970
I couldn't figure out where the fucking thing was.

417
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.610
It was one of these great moments just wandering around Paris and I saw this

418
00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:07.190
beautiful park and I was just like,
neo,
let's go in there.

419
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.690
It's just walk in there.
She was like,
all right.

420
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.730
So we start walking in and I started to take in the view and I turned around and

421
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:15.050
I looked over my shoulder

422
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.380
and I was looking right up the shams,
the easy,
however the fuck you say it.

423
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.980
And basically at the end of that street is the Arc de triumph are the way in the

424
00:26:27.721 --> 00:26:28.011
back.

425
00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:33.011
And I literally get goosebumps because all I've ever seen of that monument is

426
00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:40.250
two video footage.
One,
when Hitler,
uh,

427
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.030
when the Germans had defeated France and they were driving up that fucking

428
00:26:45.031 --> 00:26:48.420
street.
And then two,
when,
uh,

429
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.730
England and the Americans came in and we,
uh,

430
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.240
help France get the Germans out of their fucking country.
Uh,

431
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.160
all of them,
you know,
all the French women and everybody going fucking crazy.

432
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.060
It really gave me chills.
And I kept saying that to me.

433
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:07.650
I know I was freaking her out.

434
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.510
There's no way to say Hitler drove up the street in an excited way without

435
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:14.070
freaking out the person that you're with.

436
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.440
And I had to,
you know,
I'm,
uh,

437
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.540
I liked that history shit.
You know what I mean?

438
00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:29.541
It's like one of the most evil guys ever who was well on his way to taking over

439
00:27:31.641 --> 00:27:36.470
the world and possibly,
you know,

440
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.780
the height of him taking over the,

441
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.950
his quest was him driving up that famous street.

442
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.760
And,
uh,
I don't know.
I'm somebody who got fun.
I was on the road and,
and um,

443
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.980
and Canada,
somebody got me a,
uh,

444
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:59.170
gave me this book that the guns of August and it's about world war one and it's

445
00:27:59.871 --> 00:28:03.200
phenomenal.
And uh,

446
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.540
I knew that France had lost to Germany in World War One and World War Two

447
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:11.120
initially,
both wars,

448
00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:14.990
but I didn't realize that in like 1870,

449
00:28:14.991 --> 00:28:19.070
they had had another war in Germany.
One that one.
Ah,

450
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.560
why didn't I bring the book down?
Yeah,
I'll read the quote next week.

451
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.910
And basically France lost France straight up,

452
00:28:27.921 --> 00:28:31.520
lost that war.
It wasn't like World War One,

453
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:34.400
world war two where they got occupied and then eventually got him out of there.

454
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.130
At least I think that's what happened in World War One.
Cause I,

455
00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:42.080
I don't know much about that world,
but in 1870,
they fucking lost in,

456
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.470
aside from having to give up some land,
one of the things,

457
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.420
part of the treaty and the end is they had to lift the Germans drive up.

458
00:28:50.421 --> 00:28:53.290
That street is sharms and easy.
Right.

459
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.020
And not one French person showed up.

460
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.000
It was one of the darkest days in their history.

461
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.230
I mean talk about absolute fucking humiliation,
right?

462
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.970
So these sons of bitches drive,
drove up the street and uh,

463
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.920
and then they had to pay like,

464
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.940
like some ridiculous amount of Franks as a punishment.

465
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.290
I want to say 5 billion,

466
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:21.350
but there's no way anybody could afford that back and fucking 1870.

467
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.500
And I'm supposed to take an entire generation for them to pay it back to the

468
00:29:24.501 --> 00:29:25.310
Germans,

469
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:29.780
which would obviously keep France week and these mother fuckers,

470
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.560
so on of these guys off their back,
they paid it off in three years.

471
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.450
I'm going to go out on the limb and say that nobody ate a Baguette for fucking

472
00:29:38.451 --> 00:29:42.700
three years here in France and they get the Germans off their backs.
And uh,

473
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.810
so once they did,
there was this expression over here,

474
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:49.120
I guess according to the book anyways,

475
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:54.450
where basically that moment in their history when the Germans drove up Shawn's

476
00:29:56.591 --> 00:30:01.250
Elisa,
which I'm sure I'm saying it wrong,
uh,
it would basically said,
um,

477
00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:07.770
yeah,
it was something like to never be spoken of,

478
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.520
but always thought about basically never forget that.
Don't bring it up.

479
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:19.250
That's how,
how much it hurt them to that to happen.
And it was referred to,

480
00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.720
uh,
what was it referred to?

481
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.670
I can't remember.
I can't remember as such,
I'm the worst.
Um,

482
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.980
basically I didn't realize it that it happens.

483
00:30:31.981 --> 00:30:34.660
So the fact that fucking Hitler did it again,

484
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.050
I don't know if it happened again in world war one.
I have no fucking idea.

485
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.953
<v 5>MMM.</v>

486
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.660
<v 1>So I don't know shit about World War One,
but I happen again.
It will go to,</v>

487
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.550
so it actually happened again.

488
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.690
<v 5>And uh,</v>

489
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.830
<v 1>as far as I've gotten into their book,
the guns of August,</v>

490
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.310
basically the fucking reason why

491
00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.330
Germany started the first one,

492
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.320
uh,
kind of England and France and everybody else,

493
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.660
they will be in constant to the Germans.

494
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.460
They just wanted to be acknowledged.
They just want it to be included.

495
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.500
So I guess whenever these diplomats would go around Europe and they would visit,

496
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.720
everybody always went to Paris.

497
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.280
Everybody went to fucking Paris because Paris is the shit.
All right.

498
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.600
And people would go to London.
I don't know where the,

499
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.510
maybe they go to Fox in Rome,
but no one ever went to Berlin.

500
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.170
And I guess they started getting this inferiority complex.

501
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.020
Plus there was a couple of treaties going on.

502
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.900
We're just logistically German felt that they were going to have to fight a war

503
00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:47.530
on two fronts and they were going to get fucked.
So unless they

504
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.800
made a move first they were going to be in trouble.
And uh,

505
00:31:53.801 --> 00:31:57.640
you know,
France and England were playing a good,
you know,
the great game of what,

506
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:01.430
we're not going to invade you.
We're not going to try to,
you know,

507
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.950
fucking take over your shit.
Why would we do that?
We're France and England.

508
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.940
We don't have a record of doing that around the fucking world for centuries.

509
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.530
They kind of had an argument,
I'm not to,
I'm talking about world war one here.

510
00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:17.920
I'm not talking about the fucking maniac.
They were World War Two.

511
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:20.230
I'm just saying,
I actually kind of understood like how,

512
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:24.400
so that's Kinda that that was their logic.
Let's say it was the right move.

513
00:32:24.401 --> 00:32:27.640
But that was very interesting.
So anyways,
uh,

514
00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.060
this is basically what I've been doing here and now today I'm trying to knock

515
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:35.920
the podcast out,
uh,
early
cause like I said,

516
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:40.430
we haven't done anything touristy.
We walked,
we walked up,
uh,

517
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.880
the sharms and day that street for a to go see the,

518
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.750
the trials.
And um,

519
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.580
it was funny the first it was a breathtaking street,

520
00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.650
but the closer you got to the monument,

521
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.280
the more I felt like I was in times square where,
you know,

522
00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.460
there's like a forever 21 and shit like that.

523
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.840
Very disappointing that there was that although I did use a public bathroom that

524
00:33:04.841 --> 00:33:09.010
costs me two euros,
that was the cleanest thing I had ever been to.
Um,

525
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.180
but I didn't realize that,
you know,

526
00:33:10.181 --> 00:33:13.480
you can actually go to the top of that monument.
I had no idea.

527
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:18.220
And I also still have no idea how you actually get to the monument because it's

528
00:33:18.221 --> 00:33:22.660
in the middle of a fucking rotary and there are subway stairs on the other side.

529
00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:26.320
And we went down into the subway and followed the sign and all it did was spit

530
00:33:26.321 --> 00:33:28.390
us out on the same side.
I couldn't figure it out.

531
00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:33.490
And at the end of the day I have to stand in a fucking line to stand up on

532
00:33:33.491 --> 00:33:35.650
something where I can probably get a taller view,

533
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.880
a higher view at a fucking restaurant at the top of a hotel where there's no

534
00:33:39.881 --> 00:33:40.714
line.

535
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.650
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

536
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.040
<v 1>And I can actually look at the monument rather than stand on the monument and</v>

537
00:33:45.041 --> 00:33:47.710
look at a fucking hotel.
It doesn't make any sense.

538
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.530
You want to stand behind fat flux in Jean shorts,

539
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.890
then go to a monument and try to go to the top of it.
I can tell you that.

540
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:58.220
Anyways,
so then finally me and were like three,

541
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:00.830
four days here said,
hey,
do you want to look at the Eiffel Tower now?

542
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.210
And she's like,
yeah,
we're both exhausted cause that's a long fucking walk.

543
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.470
Um Oh and by the way,
the way they had this,
their city laid out,

544
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.290
there's like little oomph.
Um,
they're,

545
00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:16.920
they're famous museum with a Mano,
Mona Lisa is,

546
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:22.060
which I've yet to go see.
I'm going to do that today and right.

547
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.760
Which I don't like the whole setup of it.
How you have,
you have to go in,

548
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.730
you got to go in to see her cause you know,

549
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.160
cause that bitch ain't coming outside.
No,

550
00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.220
you gotta you gotta go in and see the fucking thing.
I already know.

551
00:34:35.221 --> 00:34:38.790
I heard it's really small and uh,
you know,

552
00:34:38.791 --> 00:34:43.650
she's got that Ryan Gosling smile.
I'm going to go do it just to fucking do it.

553
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:44.603
But um,

554
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:49.650
every day you walk by that there's just bus loads of fucking kids getting

555
00:34:49.651 --> 00:34:52.800
dragged there by their French teachers from around the fucking world.

556
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:57.720
And you know,
I don't know.
That's why I'm going there on a Monday.

557
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.990
I figured the weekends are going to be worse,

558
00:35:00.991 --> 00:35:05.880
so I'm going to go there and Nia is just like me when it comes to museums.

559
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:10.920
She likes him for a finite period.
Museums just make me feel dumb.

560
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:15.420
I'm going,
I'm going to be honest with you.
I go in there and I try.

561
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.380
<v 4>Okay.</v>

562
00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:22.040
<v 1>Patrice O'Neal who started this great bit about it was some disaster,</v>

563
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.380
like giant disaster that happened and they were showing all the sad people and

564
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:32.180
he was talking about how we sat there and he tried so hard to give a fuck.

565
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.920
Um,
which I'm butchering in his delivery of it of course was perfect,

566
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.770
but um,
that's how I feel when I'm,

567
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:45.670
when I go into a a,
a museum,
the eggs,

568
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.280
the Patrice O'Neal bit where I'm trying so hard to give a fuck.

569
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.310
I just don't care about old stuff.
I respect it.

570
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.250
I would rather hear a scientist.

571
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.330
I'd rather watch a scientist don't television.
Tell me why.

572
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:02.370
What I'm looking at is so fucking important.

573
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.730
Rather than going up there and have to read the index card,

574
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.780
it's like an index card.
It's like a fucking notebook,

575
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:13.890
paper size thing of all this shit that just,

576
00:36:13.891 --> 00:36:15.270
there's too much shit to know.

577
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.960
They know I go in there and want to look at the knickknacks of all the fucking

578
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.500
or the boutique up racks,
all of the fucking,

579
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.510
and it's just,
it's too much.
All right.
I like going to car museums,

580
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.350
stuff like that,
you know,
like,
and I can,
I can deal with that.

581
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.810
So I'm not saying museums are bad,
I'm just saying that,
uh,

582
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:41.950
I am not refined enough as a human being to actually appreciate what's going to

583
00:36:42.981 --> 00:36:46.370
be in that thing.
We'll see.
I'll talk,
I'll talk to you about it next week.
But um,

584
00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.120
so anyways,
we had gone to a

585
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.503
<v 5>mmm.</v>

586
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:57.090
<v 1>The Arctic dry off and then,
uh,</v>

587
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.910
I finally go,
all right,
you want to go see the Eiffel Tower?
I mean,
we saw it,

588
00:37:02.911 --> 00:37:06.840
we saw basically a third of it all the way to about a half of it for most parks,

589
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.010
the amazing views.

590
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.090
So we're both tired from walking up the street.

591
00:37:12.091 --> 00:37:16.740
So we got one of those little like Rick Shaw fucking things.
It was the greatest.

592
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.580
So we get jumped in that thing.

593
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:23.630
We're going on the rotary around the fucking r and a

594
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.670
and we just riding along,
riding along,
riding along.
And then once again,

595
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.090
because the French,
the French know how to make a city.

596
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.750
You go around this roundabout and then all of a sudden there's this,

597
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.590
there's all these buildings and then there's just this giant gap.

598
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.990
And literally I was looking down because I was like videoing as we were riding

599
00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.330
and I just heard Nia gasp.

600
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:51.180
And I looked up in there and there was like,

601
00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:56.030
like a fucking tyrannosaurus rex,
like a giant had just taken up,
you know,

602
00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.560
taking a step right towards you.
It was unbelievable.

603
00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:04.040
The greatest tourist attraction I've ever fucking seen.
And I never,

604
00:38:04.041 --> 00:38:08.000
I didn't even go up.
We never went up in it.
We just stood there and looked at it,

605
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.990
um,
essentially from across the river,

606
00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:16.010
but it's right on the river and it's so goddamn big.

607
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.560
It was,
it was incredible.

608
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:24.050
And then we just went across the way and we sat in a cafe and just,

609
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:26.660
uh,
just looked at it.

610
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:33.320
And what's great about the cafes here in France is they,

611
00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:38.740
I'd never been to anything like it.
All the chairs are phased out at the street

612
00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:41.570
<v 6>off Nini.</v>

613
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:45.350
<v 1>I think she just came in.</v>

614
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.830
All the chairs are just faced out at the street cause you just,
you just,

615
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.700
you don't want to miss anything that's going by all these fucking beautiful

616
00:38:52.701 --> 00:38:56.030
women all dressed unbelievably.

617
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:57.710
Um,

618
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:02.770
and then you got the Eiffel Tower in the background and we got there just before

619
00:39:02.971 --> 00:39:05.070
dusk and it does,
they turn the lights on.

620
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:10.610
<v 6>Oh,
there she is.
Bose.
Yo Madame gonna miss you.</v>

621
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.153
Um,

622
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.550
<v 1>come on in.
Come on in.</v>

623
00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.660
I was smart enough this time to not plug my mixer in right before he stuck it in

624
00:39:19.921 --> 00:39:24.120
the wall with the adapter.
I saw,
I saw the two prong thinks.
I'm like,
wait,

625
00:39:24.121 --> 00:39:29.121
this is what happened to me the last time with my $99 fucking mixer.

626
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.710
We'll come on over here.
Uh,
maybe the,
uh,
the microphone that go,

627
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:40.140
uh,
that means okay.
Everybody,
she has told me she's feeling about it.
Um,

628
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.290
so anyways,
I was just telling them,
what are you talking about?

629
00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.290
You just cleared your,
sorry.
See that big blip there?

630
00:39:49.291 --> 00:39:52.570
You just clear it right near the microphone.
Jimmy excused.

631
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.773
<v 7>Um,</v>

632
00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:58.480
so I was just telling them about taking that Rick shop bike over to the,
uh,

633
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.350
the Eiffel Tower and just how they have the city laid out where you don't see
it,

634
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:04.640
you don't see,
you don't see,
and then he's just boom,

635
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.370
10 buildings and how he was sitting in that cafe.
Uh,

636
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.933
yeah.

637
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.290
<v 1>So was an amazing drink wine and I was smoking my little pretentious cigars,</v>

638
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:21.280
cigarettes,
things.
That's another thing too.

639
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:25.480
Like everybody fucking smoked over here.
It's hilarious.
It's great.

640
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:30.520
There's no,
there's no surgeon general here whatsoever.
But uh,

641
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.760
I was mentioning that we're going to go see,
uh,

642
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.580
the Mona Lisa today and I'm not a museum person and I've,

643
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.830
I've kind of been speaking for you on a scale of one to 10,
your,

644
00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:46.810
your feelings about museums.
Hmm.
You know what?

645
00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.310
I would say I'm at a seven.

646
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.940
<v 6>I'm not a full on 10 because I don't,</v>

647
00:40:53.941 --> 00:40:58.530
I'm not the kind of person that's like wants to spend an entire day in a museum.

648
00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.760
I want to go in,

649
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.660
see the shift that I want to see and then get out because it's exhausting.

650
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.410
But there are certain things I love.
I love,
I do love museums,

651
00:41:07.411 --> 00:41:09.000
but I just don't want to go there and like,

652
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.720
like when we're in New York and I go to the Moma,
I had,
I just want to go in,

653
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:16.380
see some things and leave.
I don't want to spend the day at the moment.

654
00:41:16.381 --> 00:41:19.110
Some people do that and they love it.
I can't,
I can't do that.

655
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.900
<v 1>I literally get sick to my stomach when I hear you say go to the Moma.</v>

656
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:24.510
<v 6>What do you mean?</v>

657
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.950
<v 1>It's just like,</v>

658
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:31.130
I feel like I'm back in school and it's the class I hate and I have to sit there

659
00:41:31.171 --> 00:41:34.220
until the bell rings.
Do you,
when I was a single

660
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.330
<v 2>man in New York,
the amount of time people go,
oh,
take it to the museum,</v>

661
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.050
take it to a museum.
And it would always is the worst fucking date.
And it was,

662
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:44.360
and I would do it because people say that,
you know,

663
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:48.000
that's where you take these New York ladies.
So right.

664
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.650
Then I would take them there like I was culture and that culture and I would go

665
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:55.190
there and I'd be bored shitless and then they would feel it.

666
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.010
Like I'm telling like 20 minutes,
15,

667
00:41:58.011 --> 00:42:02.780
20 minutes depending on how good looking she was.
1520 minutes in,
I would be,

668
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:05.660
I would just be bored shitless at what you'd be looking for,

669
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.710
for a place to buy a hot dog.
But the thing is there's certain,

670
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:11.840
there'll be certain exhibits that museums that you would like.

671
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:16.220
Remember when we went to the car museum?
I said good,
I liked the car museum.

672
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.950
You're like that.
I like uh,

673
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:23.090
I liked there was like a standup comedy exhibit.
Yeah.
That's not a museum.

674
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.470
That's just cool shit.

675
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.250
Or like a bunch of cool photographs I could get into.
Right.

676
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:33.860
But the uh,
the,
the artifacts,
like when we went to,
we went to the,

677
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:37.200
the fucking thing there,
I was on the ceiling.

678
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:42.000
That shit was just shovel.
You were like black walking through there.

679
00:42:42.001 --> 00:42:44.910
Like you were walking through an airport trying to get to your gate.

680
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.280
You were like walking so fast.
Barely looking at anything.

681
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.240
You were just like,

682
00:42:51.241 --> 00:42:54.220
I'm just walking through this because I just have one cause it's the Sistine

683
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.280
chapel.
It was one vista mall vestments after another.

684
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.480
This beautiful,
no,
what are you talking about?

685
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.750
It Wa I know we have this whole,
I can't even believe that you would say that.

686
00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:09.260
It's not beautiful in there.
It was absolutely gorgeous.
It was a lot to take in,

687
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.520
but you're,
you're like,
you're like,
what?
13 year old boy.
You're like,

688
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:18.410
this is boring.
It looks like you look like an Italians living room.

689
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.100
You know that Hacky joke that they do where they talk about that room that's all

690
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:26.390
covered in plastic that no one can go into.
Yeah,
that's what it looks like.

691
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.520
It's just ornate.

692
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.570
I'm going to use the word [inaudible] so fucking over.

693
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.810
It was so gaudy.
Every look,

694
00:43:35.811 --> 00:43:39.290
you know how you love how the Parisian stress where it's basically all dark

695
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.390
color,
all dark color,

696
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.660
and then like the splash of color with the scarf or the shoes or the hat and

697
00:43:44.661 --> 00:43:48.770
everything else is sorta,
it was it,
was it muted,
Matte,
neutral,

698
00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.220
whatever the fucking word is.
Um,

699
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.990
that was the exact opposite.
Yeah.
That was the epitome of,

700
00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.430
oh,
but look,
no,

701
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:05.470
but there's so much time and skill that goes into putting all those frescoes up.

702
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.800
It was absolutely incredible though.
You got to appreciate that part of it.

703
00:44:09.801 --> 00:44:14.240
You gotta be shade the artistry that goes into something like the same way I can

704
00:44:14.241 --> 00:44:18.170
appreciate an older movie,
but also realize that the dialogues a little dated,

705
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:22.370
like the way they decorated it.
There's a little dated.
Oh,
I've got to give what,

706
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:24.980
what does it,
what do you mean dated?
I mean it's,
it's Rome.

707
00:44:24.981 --> 00:44:28.370
It's one of the oldest cities.
I love Rome.
I loved Rome.

708
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.480
I loved everything about it.

709
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:34.540
Other than that fucking the only museum I went to was a stupid Sistine chapel.

710
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:39.260
And it's sucked when you go there and make a right and go go right to the

711
00:44:39.261 --> 00:44:42.090
ceiling painting and then get the fuck outta here.

712
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:45.930
Don't go to the left and see every chalice they ever fucking drank out of for

713
00:44:45.931 --> 00:44:48.660
like the next.
And it wasn't even crowded that day.

714
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.240
God forbid if it was fucking crowded,
you're gonna,
you're gonna.

715
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.400
I swear to God you're going to think about abandoning your family for good is

716
00:44:56.401 --> 00:45:00.160
your,
if you're wired like me.
Um,
so by the way,
uh,

717
00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:01.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

718
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:06.050
<v 2>I would now say having been here that uh,</v>

719
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:11.370
Paris,
as far as Europe goes,
yes.
Paris is like New York City.

720
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.810
I'd say London.
It's like a smart Chicago.

721
00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:19.780
I love saying that just to piss off people in Chicago

722
00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.980
and then Rome is sort of like a Boston Philly kind of thing.
You know what?

723
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:31.010
I really feel like it's a complete like travesty that you would try to compare

724
00:45:32.081 --> 00:45:35.610
these amazing European cities to cities in the United States.
Oh,

725
00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.470
gimme of the city,
New York,

726
00:45:38.471 --> 00:45:43.471
Chicago and Boston painted them said like Europe.

727
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:46.430
Like that's stupid.
Well most of my listeners to do that,

728
00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.540
most of my listeners are from the United States of America.
They need,

729
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:51.970
they need a frame of reference when I'm doing,

730
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.380
you don't need to give them some sort of like water down frame of reference like

731
00:45:56.381 --> 00:46:01.270
no,
Paris
and Rome is like Rome.
Jesus.

732
00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:01.571
Yeah,

733
00:46:01.571 --> 00:46:05.230
you got to do that person who comes over here and now fucking just says that

734
00:46:05.231 --> 00:46:09.700
everything over here is,
is like is paid with gold.
No,

735
00:46:09.701 --> 00:46:13.480
I'm not saying you see all those suspicions.
Shipping jackasses and England.

736
00:46:13.481 --> 00:46:17.120
I mean you can't tell me that.
That's not Chicago.
Like the monopod,

737
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.650
the checks and I had an awesome time so I honestly,
I don't know that much about,

738
00:46:20.651 --> 00:46:21.760
I love Chicago.

739
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:27.010
I love Chicago and I gave London props or I said that it's like a smarter

740
00:46:27.011 --> 00:46:31.950
Chicago plus.
I like Chicago.
That's what I go through with.

741
00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:35.830
Somebody has to go down in the scenario.
Sorry Chicago.
Oh fuck you.

742
00:46:35.831 --> 00:46:37.910
I love Chicago.
When you would go,
me,
I'm a moron that,

743
00:46:37.911 --> 00:46:40.330
but I bought the totally been doing this.
Talk about dumb.
I am on this.

744
00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:44.800
I can't even go to a fucking museum and enjoy myself.
Um,
oh,

745
00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:49.740
so also out here,
um,
oh,
you know what you missed yesterday.

746
00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:53.310
You missed these two.
Uh,
I was going to say French people like,

747
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:57.330
like what else are they out here?
These two French guys.
Oh,

748
00:46:57.331 --> 00:47:01.870
that's another thing too.
Uh,
uh,
just like in,

749
00:47:01.871 --> 00:47:06.420
in what I love about traveling,
just the,
but just like in Philly,
I would,

750
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:09.000
cheese steak is just called the cheese steak.
They don't go,

751
00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:13.620
can I get a Philly cheese steak there in Philly?
Just like over here.

752
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.920
French toast is not French toast to put pound per do I do that part,

753
00:47:22.651 --> 00:47:26.520
but that's what it is.
There's no French in it.
They are French.

754
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:31.360
They don't need to say it.
So that's my travel.
It's delicious.

755
00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.840
It's wasn't a really good with that customer.

756
00:47:33.841 --> 00:47:38.230
Although in Boston it's still a Boston cream pie says cause it's Boston.
Yeah,

757
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:42.820
we're more on
that where we are.

758
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:49.090
Oh,
I happen to have a login,
Framingham,
whatever.

759
00:47:49.091 --> 00:47:51.700
Over there they got to do a fight.
Everything in Boston,

760
00:47:51.701 --> 00:47:56.140
just to say that it's Boston related.
Oh,
shut up.
It's not like Boston.

761
00:47:56.141 --> 00:47:59.920
I love my city,
but come on Boston is you want to talk about dumb,

762
00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.100
let's talk about Boston.
What are you talking about?

763
00:48:03.101 --> 00:48:06.700
How you know we have Harvard,

764
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.820
Boston universities.
I went to college and plastic.

765
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.230
It's a wonderful,
uh,
Mecca of university,

766
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:16.840
University of people who come from other places

767
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:25.090
to continue their education in a very,
uh,
beautiful risk fall setting.

768
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:26.980
Otherwise I would,

769
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.640
it's a bunch of Jack as is as you say.

770
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:36.070
<v 1>I would be,
I would be offended by that if I didn't fit into that fucking story.</v>

771
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.350
Believe it or not,
people,
I did not get accepted to Harvard.

772
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.900
I got accepted to Wentworth.
Wentworth was a construction.

773
00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.093
Uh,

774
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.580
<v 2>what is this is like,</v>

775
00:48:49.581 --> 00:48:52.460
this is like fucking breakfast club when I'm dumb because I know how to make a

776
00:48:52.461 --> 00:48:55.840
lamp.
No,
you're not.
No,
you're a genius because you how to make a left.

777
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:59.200
That's what you supposed to say.
And I had no construction skills

778
00:48:59.280 --> 00:48:59.941
<v 1>whatsoever.</v>

779
00:48:59.941 --> 00:49:04.941
The reason why I picked it was because it just looked like it was a fun job

780
00:49:05.191 --> 00:49:08.850
because I was working in warehousing and I noticed when you worked with a bunch

781
00:49:08.851 --> 00:49:12.240
of other guys in the boss was sort of there but not really there.

782
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.580
You could just stand around breaking balls all day.

783
00:49:14.581 --> 00:49:17.000
So that's why I picked the school.
Right.

784
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:18.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

785
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.560
I get accepted there and then I also got semi accepted to northeastern.

786
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:27.370
Like all right,
we'll let you take,
we'll let you take a couple of classes.

787
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:32.960
So yeah,
you'd do.
And yeah,
it was a fucking nightmare.
And then I went to,

788
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:37.250
I went to neither place I got,
I got rejected from Harvard of course,

789
00:49:37.251 --> 00:49:39.890
cause I wasn't smart enough.
My Dad went to Harvard,
so I thought like,

790
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.450
well let me apply to Harvard.

791
00:49:41.451 --> 00:49:45.470
I feel like I should have your family a big harder to get into Harvard.

792
00:49:45.471 --> 00:49:47.720
But I didn't.
And I went to Emerson and it was awesome.

793
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:52.580
So is there is my college story and that's my college story.

794
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:57.440
What,
coming up on an hour here.
Uh,
what do you,
what are you talking about here?

795
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:58.723
I talk about

796
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.080
<v 1>it's about everything.
Oh,
you know,</v>

797
00:50:00.081 --> 00:50:04.840
something else I've been trying like every frigging cigar,
uh,

798
00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:07.820
that you can try out here because of selection is incredible.

799
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:14.230
But this is what I have learned.
Even in Paris.
If you want to buy a cigar,

800
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.780
go to a cigar store.
What's the one that I went to down the street.

801
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:19.583
A Ruth

802
00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:24.620
<v 2>on way?
Yeah.
You got to go to a specialty place.
Just like with the,
uh,</v>

803
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:29.770
the belongs only you go to Boulogne jewelry.
That's bakery.
Yeah,

804
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.780
to get the salt and the baguettes and I guess you go to a patsy salary to get

805
00:50:35.991 --> 00:50:40.610
the like little cakes and macaroons and things like that.
Yeah,
because

806
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.970
<v 1>then that what's you,
you just going to get ripped off?</v>

807
00:50:42.971 --> 00:50:46.840
Like it's weird because they got all these places.
Is it just,
it was his t a,
B,

808
00:50:46.841 --> 00:50:50.980
a c tobacco.
The Buck?
Yes.
You just see those signs and you're like,
oh,

809
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.790
this Cuban cigars in there and you walk in there but they don't know what the

810
00:50:54.791 --> 00:50:55.720
fuck they're doing.
Like,

811
00:50:55.721 --> 00:51:00.430
I walked in to one yesterday and I bought two different size,

812
00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.860
like Cohibas,
the smaller ones and real thin ones and uh,

813
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.770
he's supposed to like,
basically what you do is you squeeze the end of it.

814
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.640
He's supposed to go in about 50% and that's supposed to come back out

815
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:15.690
<v 2>and like smushed watching you squeeze your imaginaries.
Yeah,</v>

816
00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.360
<v 1>the cigar,
regardless of how hard it is,
it doesn't make a difference.</v>

817
00:51:19.361 --> 00:51:22.720
It's that right there that'll give you a good drop at the whole thing was Swiss

818
00:51:22.721 --> 00:51:25.540
squishy and I noticed that they seemed almost a little wet.

819
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:28.400
They had the fucking humidifier up too high.
And I'm sitting there,

820
00:51:28.401 --> 00:51:30.430
I was smoking it last night.
It was like,
you know,
I was like,

821
00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:33.280
I'm smoking wet leaves.
It just,
and it was a Cuban,
it was,

822
00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:36.010
I had to finish the thing.
How funny it was.

823
00:51:36.011 --> 00:51:38.930
It when I stuck the Qtip in the end of it to the science.

824
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.260
So I get down there yet it was still,
you know,

825
00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.050
better than any cigar that I usually get it.

826
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:44.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

827
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:48.070
It's like when you're like in college or whatever and you're trying to smoke

828
00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:50.260
like the very smallest part of the joint,

829
00:51:50.261 --> 00:51:54.640
you use a pair of tweezers to smoke out of it.
That was it.
Yeah,

830
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.710
exactly.
That's a French club.
There's a famous

831
00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:59.830
<v 1>story,
cause I've only heard it once in my life.
I'm not going to sell it.</v>

832
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.770
It's famous.
Uh,
Castro,
when he was at the UN,

833
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:08.100
he actually lit up during the whole meeting of the minds of people around the

834
00:52:08.591 --> 00:52:11.020
world.
And as he's sitting there listening,
he's smoking a Cuban,

835
00:52:11.021 --> 00:52:14.320
which I think is a big fuck you to the u s like,
yeah,

836
00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:17.640
you guys wish you could be smoking these.
And in the end he,
he,
he,
what?

837
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:20.410
He uses a roach clip was some part of his glasses.

838
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.470
He's stuck it in there and he was holding his glasses,

839
00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:28.490
like hitting it like a at yeah.
Huh.
Dressed like he was on [inaudible]

840
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:32.590
<v 2>Mash.
Um,</v>

841
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:36.430
I got you a question from the blue.
Long jury.
Okay.

842
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.130
What flavor plane?
The butter one.
How do you say it?
Be?

843
00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.153
Um,

844
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:49.700
<v 1>okay,
let's read a couple of these things here.
Uh,
fake sports enthusiasm.</v>

845
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.740
Um,

846
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.600
dear Billy balls between the final four and the Superbowl,

847
00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:00.140
which one do you think attracts the most fake female sports fans?

848
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:03.880
All just running out the door and whatever color they are rooting for it.

849
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:08.690
Never watched any regular season games,
which is it?
I say the final four.
Uh,

850
00:53:08.691 --> 00:53:11.150
first of all,
I don't think that you got to just say that it's women.

851
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:14.300
<v 2>Uh,
yeah.
Fuck you announce Jesus.</v>

852
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.680
I'm not saying that because Nia is here either.
Otherwise I might subconsciously,

853
00:53:18.681 --> 00:53:19.850
because we have to spend the day,

854
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.120
the most fake female sports fans.
There's only fake female sports friends.

855
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.280
I would say,
oh,

856
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:32.550
I would put the Superbowl is brutal for the fake female sports fair.

857
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.050
It's fucking brutal because

858
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:39.330
most people pretend like they give a shit about the Superbowl when they don't.

859
00:53:39.331 --> 00:53:41.610
They just want to watch the goddamn commercials.
That's a,

860
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:45.650
that's a very ignorant point of view of what you're doing right now because

861
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.550
you're looking at your own head and saying,

862
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:50.810
this is the view of the world to put things in the,
at your part.

863
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.580
A lot of people are.
I didn't say you're part of the problem.

864
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:58.500
You're the woman who shows up that doesn't give a fuck and touch,
you know,

865
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:02.460
I don't go to games or any of that kind of shit with you because I had usually

866
00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:05.310
don't care.
No,
no bumps so but the Superbowl you do show up,

867
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:08.640
you go to a Superbowl party,
eat the food you top during the game,

868
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.130
shut up during the commercial and then when the game comes back on you got added

869
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.150
that God,
haven't you think that one?
Because that one wasn't that good.

870
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:19.580
That is not what I do at all.
Don't ever do that.

871
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:24.590
That more barest then on super bowl Sunday with you and I've never done that.

872
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:29.160
I usually dip out during the game or I'm sort of sitting there watching it and

873
00:54:29.161 --> 00:54:32.340
not really paying attention or if you're over in the corner giggling with your

874
00:54:32.341 --> 00:54:35.580
friends during the game.
All I hear is ha ha.
Now

875
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:44.300
I would actually say the super bowl because the super bowl has become like a

876
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:49.560
national holiday and it's the fact that it is one day.

877
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.850
It is on the weekend.
It's only just for one fucking day.

878
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.470
And uh,

879
00:54:56.070 --> 00:55:01.070
the fact that there's going to be food and all of that stuff for non sports fans

880
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:04.410
to still enjoy.
Um,

881
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.170
and then all the other extra fucking hyping like,
oh,

882
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:10.500
we need to turn the channel and watch the puppy bowl or whatever the fuck it is

883
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:13.110
or yeah.
Oh my God.

884
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:15.773
That's cute.

885
00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:20.100
It's fucking Bruno Mars is going to be playing at halftime.

886
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:25.230
He did kill a,
he's awesome.
Killed it.
He's awesome.
I'm not saying he didn't,

887
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:30.000
but I'm just saying better than Tom.
Petty.
Tom Petty.

888
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:34.890
Tom Petty came out looking like the guy in the Nichols.
Oh,
that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

889
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:39.090
The bond last dance and maybe that guy.
Yeah,

890
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.540
he looked literally,
who's the guy in the Nicole stuff?

891
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.840
Thomas Jefferson or Thomas Jefferson or a Tom Petty.

892
00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:52.950
Tom Petty.
All right.
Girlfriend.
Cheating on her diet.

893
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.570
Really written off.
Um,

894
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.800
why you don't like that delivery now that's actually a very funny girlfriend.

895
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:03.810
Cheating Dat.
Dat Dat on her,
on a diet.

896
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:08.030
That sounds like a gay guy wrote that order diet.
Um,

897
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.560
ridiculous.
Scandalous.

898
00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:17.580
I'm up 27 years old and have a girlfriend of six years whom I live with.

899
00:56:17.581 --> 00:56:18.810
When we first got together,

900
00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:23.220
she had a sexy athletic body that all changed last year when she got promoted,

901
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.710
started working long hours in a high stress position.
Uh,

902
00:56:26.711 --> 00:56:31.090
she began smoking weed almost every night claiming it to help you relax after a

903
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:34.720
hard day's work.
And she also started eating like Shit,

904
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.810
lost of lots of fast food,
larger portions,
et cetera.

905
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:43.110
She's probably 60 to 70 pounds heavier than when we first met and on her five

906
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:48.910
three frame if fucking shows,
man,
after ignoring my sub,

907
00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:51.370
that would show on a six foot frame after my,

908
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:54.610
after ignoring my suddenly 60 to 70 pounds heavier.

909
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:58.660
After ignoring my subtle hints for the last year,

910
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:02.110
I finally sat her down last month and said,
enough is enough.

911
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:05.560
She needs to make an effort to get healthier.
I did everything.

912
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:07.870
Does this support her and losing weight.

913
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:12.250
I paid for an expensive supplement program that are co workers recommended.

914
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:17.280
I started making her healthy lunches every day to take to work when she get home

915
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:20.140
from work.
I'd have a healthy dinner ready for on the table.

916
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.680
I even paid for a new gym membership and bought her a new bicycle.

917
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.120
Today I found a hidden cachet of fast food wrappers in the garage.

918
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:32.560
This led me to believe to look at our bank statements from the last month.

919
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:37.360
She's been picking up fast food on her way home from work nearly everyday since

920
00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:41.290
we talked.
It sounds like a biggest loser story.
Not only that,

921
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:45.610
she'd also buy fast food at lunches sometimes to suggesting that she was tossing

922
00:57:45.611 --> 00:57:49.330
the lunches.
I made her in the trash.
This really pissed me off.

923
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:52.900
I'm a guy who takes care of my body and one a woman who does the same.

924
00:57:52.901 --> 00:57:56.740
She's only 24 and hasn't had children.
She shouldn't have a beer,

925
00:57:56.741 --> 00:57:59.150
gut jowls and saggy tits.
The

926
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:05.260
<v 6>Oh you are so in the pocket you sold as the take your computer and throw it out</v>

927
00:58:05.991 --> 00:58:07.430
the goddamn window.

928
00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:14.360
Can you please finish the rest of this so I can go off on this asshole please

929
00:58:14.361 --> 00:58:18.830
just put an issue because I swear to fucking God.
I swear to God.

930
00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.240
I think he's making a lot of good points.
He,
oh my God.

931
00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.970
The fact that I spent my God,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

932
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.760
Don't scream two pumps too close to the computer.

933
00:58:28.761 --> 00:58:33.290
I don't use a mixture of this week.
The fact that I spent all this time,

934
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.470
<v 2>money and effort on her,</v>

935
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:38.610
only to have her sabotage it and hide it from me makes me seriously call our

936
00:58:38.611 --> 00:58:41.730
relationship into question.
What would you do?

937
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:46.440
<v 6>My situation?
Oh my God.
And he was taking off her shoes.
You know what?</v>

938
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:49.810
No one has to be core.
No,
I know.
I know.

939
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:54.880
I you know what you shallows,
bullshit.

940
00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:57.970
Fucking asshole guy who wrote this letter.

941
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:02.020
Let me explain something to you right now.
You think you care about her health?

942
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:03.640
You don't care about her health.

943
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:05.830
You certainly don't care about her state of mind.

944
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:10.660
All you care about is whether or not your girlfriends hot enough.
What for you?

945
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:13.990
For your friends,
for society.
You don't give a shit.
You said yourself,

946
00:59:13.991 --> 00:59:17.140
she's got this job.
She's stressed out and so she's stressed eating.

947
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:19.570
That's what a lot of people do.
Okay,
and you're sitting here,

948
00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:21.650
you seem like you were well intentioned.
Right?

949
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:25.280
But now it seems like you're just being fucking shallow because you don't care.

950
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:29.870
You don't care about anything that's going on inside of her physically or

951
00:59:29.871 --> 00:59:31.190
mentally or emotionally.

952
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:35.240
All you care about is what she looks like and now you're mad because she's like

953
00:59:35.241 --> 00:59:38.390
hiding it from you.
And you're calling into question of relationships.

954
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:42.470
You've been with her for six years.
Collins or question,
her relationship,

955
00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:45.260
how she feels about you because she's going through something emotional.

956
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:47.480
Why do you talk to her about how she feel?

957
00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:50.510
Because I was trying to put a bandaid on the problem and making it seem like the

958
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:53.260
care when you obviously don't give a shit.
Okay,

959
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.190
you're a shallow superficial Douche bag and she should dump your ass and get
hot.

960
00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:01.700
Even hotter than white.
And she's 2040 minutes.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute,

961
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:04.430
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Time out.
Time out.
Time out now,

962
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:06.410
how would she go about getting even hotter?

963
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:08.210
<v 4>Okay.</v>

964
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:11.330
<v 6>By losing 60 to 70 pounds,
you know what?</v>

965
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:15.260
She could get hotter by finding a guy who was making more money and who was

966
01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:17.280
nicer and like,
uh,
just a better approach.

967
01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:21.590
You should become a gold digging fat whore.
No,
no.

968
01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.770
<v 2>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Now listen,
listen.
Here's the</v>

969
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.980
<v 6>forgot her.
Even if I'm being too hot.
I'm gonna tell you right now.</v>

970
01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.230
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Yeah.</v>

971
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:36.560
<v 6>Better body when she's a teenager,
she was,
when she started to get into like her,</v>

972
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:41.330
what a surprise.
I'm out.
Unbelievable.
Oh my God.

973
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:45.250
When people get older and have like grownup responsibilities,
that's,

974
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.030
that's really crazy how that happened.

975
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.110
<v 2>So you,
you,
you hit,
you hit the,</v>

976
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.051
<v 6>and you've got what?</v>

977
01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:54.280
Like a six pack and a full head of hair and you're just like the hottest guy

978
01:00:54.281 --> 01:00:57.310
ever.
Right?
And that's not going to change for you.
And maybe in 10 years,

979
01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.550
if you go through something and you're having a hard time and the person that

980
01:01:00.551 --> 01:01:04.070
you are supposedly love and cares about you and has been with you for six years,

981
01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:08.080
just decides to what toss you aside because you gained some weight

982
01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:13.110
<v 2>barbecue.
Wait a minute.
Okay,
timeout.
Kay.
Can I defend this guy a little bit more?</v>

983
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.020
<v 6>Sure.
That's what you do.
You defend the assholes who right into you.
So go ahead.</v>

984
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.300
Well,
I can't bite the hand that feeds.
No,

985
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.670
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not defending this

986
01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:26.070
<v 2>guys just to defend this guy.
Okay?
First of all,</v>

987
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.510
you're ignoring the fact that this guy,

988
01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.800
he sat down with her in a nice way,

989
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.340
<v 4>okay,</v>

990
01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.990
<v 2>okay.
In a caring way,
Nia,</v>

991
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:41.800
to be five foot three and put it on 60 to 70 pounds and you're setting yourself

992
01:01:41.801 --> 01:01:44.680
up for heart disease and you're going to die.
And this guy,

993
01:01:44.681 --> 01:01:48.130
and she hasn't even had kids yet.
Okay.
Timeout.
Timeout.

994
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.110
And she has to go to all of that,
which,
you know,
Nia.
Okay.
You like,
that's,

995
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:57.130
that's already hard enough as it,
she's only 24 years old.

996
01:01:57.131 --> 01:02:01.810
You should not be 60 to 70 pounds or 30 pounds.
Overweight is obese.

997
01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:02.860
This girl is,

998
01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.300
is two times on a way to three times at 24th,

999
01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.560
she's blowing out her body and she's,

1000
01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.210
she's never going to be in shape again and she's going to live a miserable

1001
01:02:13.211 --> 01:02:16.140
fucking life because a very difficult life because of it.

1002
01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:19.770
She's going to blow at our knees up telling you all of this is going to come.

1003
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.560
And this guy,
he did not sit down and say,
hey,

1004
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:27.060
you used to be hot and now you're not.
He said,
time out.
No,

1005
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:29.310
he isn't the way a timeout timeout.

1006
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:34.650
He sat down with her like an adult and said that basically I'm concerned about

1007
01:02:34.651 --> 01:02:38.520
you.
Um,
you know,
we say I love you.
I'm concerned about you.

1008
01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:41.730
I want to help you get healthier.
This guy is making lunches for,

1009
01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:44.340
he's paying for a gym,
he's doing all of this stuff.

1010
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:48.960
And in the end when he's trying to help her out and then she's going behind his

1011
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.320
hurt,
his back eating,

1012
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.420
which she's doing it out of a shame thing,

1013
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:58.470
he felt betrayed and then the anger comes out and then that's when he says beer

1014
01:02:58.471 --> 01:03:01.800
got jowls and saggy tests.
Okay,
now this is the thing there,

1015
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:06.320
<v 6>like it's unnecessary for him so I put it like I understand what you're saying.</v>

1016
01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.680
<v 2>Well he has to because he can't say that to her when he can't get,</v>

1017
01:03:09.681 --> 01:03:12.440
he has to get his anger out or he has to make a fucking joke.

1018
01:03:12.441 --> 01:03:15.620
He has to do something and here this guy is also 27 years old.

1019
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:17.630
He says he keeps himself from fucking shape,

1020
01:03:17.631 --> 01:03:20.680
which you know something that's not fair to your part and it's not fair to the

1021
01:03:20.681 --> 01:03:23.070
apartment to go out and put on that kind of weight.
Okay.

1022
01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:26.410
<v 6>If he's 24 years old,
those she can bounce back.</v>

1023
01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:29.800
It's not like she's 44 she's 24 okay.

1024
01:03:29.801 --> 01:03:33.880
Like I know that hard to lose that kind of weight of course,
but she can do it.

1025
01:03:33.881 --> 01:03:34.780
But I'm just saying like

1026
01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.000
he's doing all this stuff or are you like do all like the physical stuff,

1027
01:03:40.001 --> 01:03:43.960
but he seems like he's incapable of being like emotionally support her because

1028
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:48.070
he talking about he was,
yeah,
he was in the beginning.
He wasn't the beginning.

1029
01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.030
He did this.
What he's doing in the end is he's talking to me,
guided guy.

1030
01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.720
She's 24 years old,
has he had kids,
she shouldn't have a beer,

1031
01:03:55.721 --> 01:04:00.350
gut Giles and saggy.
You know he's coming out of like a football coach.
Well,

1032
01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:03.050
she doesn't need a football coach.
He didn't he say it to her.

1033
01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:09.670
He said it to me suggesting she was tossing the lunches.
I made her in the trash.

1034
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:13.690
Yeah.
Who knows.
She might have,
she might have just is probably even a both.

1035
01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.520
She's probably right.

1036
01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:19.650
What would you do with my situation that helped this fucking guy out?

1037
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.930
He seems like he's keeping himself in shape.
He's fit.

1038
01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:27.220
He's actually a great boyfriend.
If he was a dick,
he would have said,

1039
01:04:27.221 --> 01:04:30.700
I'm breaking up with you because she had a beer gut and jealous.
He didn't.

1040
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:35.290
He tried to help her with the fucking problem guys,
problem solve.
Okay.

1041
01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:40.120
Help this guy connect with her emotionally.
So I mean,
look,

1042
01:04:40.121 --> 01:04:43.870
she's got this high stress fucking job,
but like at some point,

1043
01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:45.820
you know,

1044
01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.760
you got to settle into the stress of your job where you'd have to get a new

1045
01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:53.300
fucking job.
But this is what it's doing to you.
All right.
I mean,

1046
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:57.460
I got to tell you,
you get 60 to 70 pounds overweight at 24 fucking years of age.

1047
01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:01.030
What's going to happen in 34 and yet that is a legitimate question.

1048
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.840
It's a legitimate question because that weight thing is,

1049
01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:12.710
you know,
it starts happening.
People died.
Mia,

1050
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:18.370
not to bring up a bad fucking subject,
like taking it to the extreme though.

1051
01:05:18.371 --> 01:05:22.150
I mean,
you're going to think about being with somebody for rest of their life.

1052
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.660
You're going to have kids with this person.
They're already this much overweight.

1053
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.560
They're not going to be be there.
They're not going to fucking be there.

1054
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.410
All right,
fine.

1055
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:36.490
Maybe I went too far and when I was calling him an asshole and all that kind of

1056
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:39.940
stuff,
man.
Thank you.
What a normal reaction.
Yeah,

1057
01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:44.590
it's that last,
that last thing.
You know what I mean?
Because you know what?

1058
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:45.220
You're right.

1059
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.490
Everything that he says that he's doing in terms of making your healthy meals

1060
01:05:48.491 --> 01:05:51.730
and buying her bike to the gym membership,
that's all well and good.

1061
01:05:51.731 --> 01:05:54.250
And maybe that's,
this is the part about men and women.

1062
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:57.370
That's difficult because yes,
you guys try to problem solve.

1063
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:02.610
You don't try to connect on an emotional level and say like bury the emotions.

1064
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.000
Right?

1065
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.830
You go to the gym exactly where like it sounds like what she needs,

1066
01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:12.730
she needs to blow off steam and a lot of people do.
They eat,
they drink,

1067
01:06:12.731 --> 01:06:15.280
they smoke weed,
they do other drugs.
This is how they cope.

1068
01:06:15.281 --> 01:06:16.900
These are how people cope.
It's another thing,

1069
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:21.890
<v 8>uh,
uh,
an alcohol,
a drug,
but now she's,</v>

1070
01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:25.380
<v 6>no,
we then that increases your hunger for most people.
Like,</v>

1071
01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.700
like you wouldn't believe so and all and you don't want a salad when you're
high,

1072
01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.160
you want pizza.
And she was Burberry Nachos.

1073
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.860
<v 8>Let me ask you this.
Let's just say you're dating.
All right.</v>

1074
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:40.750
You know,
we've been going out for two years.

1075
01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:46.000
I'm in great shape and then all of a sudden the stress of the robe,

1076
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.720
I put on 60 to 70 pounds and start smoking weed.

1077
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:52.660
Now you're going to tell me that you're not going to entertain breaking up with

1078
01:06:52.661 --> 01:06:54.940
me.
You're not going to sit there and be like,

1079
01:06:54.941 --> 01:06:56.560
this is going to be the father of my kids.

1080
01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.660
This is the person who I spend my life with.

1081
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:03.990
This guy was acting like he's in fucking Wayne's world and a uncle buck all at

1082
01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:05.824
the same time.

1083
01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:09.380
<v 6>You know what?
I honestly can't say that I would.</v>

1084
01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.790
If you all of a sudden that's all you were doing with yourself and whenever you

1085
01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:16.970
weren't on the road will just sitting around smoking weed.
And you know what?

1086
01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:24.310
If I came home a magic my pasty freckle torso with man text.

1087
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.613
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

1088
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:32.020
<v 6>Right.
Fucking naval.
The size of a half dollar now.
Yeah.</v>

1089
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.070
Smoking weed and just sitting there fucking,
you know,

1090
01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.340
that's going to affect my sex drive.
Getting on top of your

1091
01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:46.000
sweating all over me.
You've got to get on top of me.
I look like I'm pregnant.

1092
01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:47.260
I mean,
give me a fucking break.

1093
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.480
And then you're walking down the street and you're seeing all these other guys

1094
01:07:52.481 --> 01:07:53.470
go to the gym.

1095
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:59.380
I would that you're in the prime of your fucking life and you're going to pick a

1096
01:07:59.381 --> 01:08:01.270
mate for the rest of your fucking life,

1097
01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:05.140
and I'm already looking like I've worked on Wall Street the 30 fucking years.

1098
01:08:05.141 --> 01:08:08.830
You're not going to sit there and have any second thoughts come on yet.
I mean,

1099
01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.790
I might not be as sexually attracted to you,
that's for sure,
but I wouldn't just,

1100
01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:16.250
or the bandaid off and just say what you're going to say,

1101
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:20.250
but I wouldn't be like I need to.
I,
that's the other thing that I have a problem.

1102
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:25.850
This is a problem that I have,
especially with this whole letter.

1103
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.990
The fact that I spent all this money and effort on only to have her sabotage it

1104
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:33.410
and hide it for me,
makes me seriously call our relationship into question.

1105
01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.010
Why does that call your relationship into questions?
Deceptive?

1106
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:41.120
Yeah,
because she's going through some emotional shit,

1107
01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:44.180
but she's been receptive about food.
It's not like she's like cheating on it.

1108
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:47.270
She's like,
you know what?
I know.
She goes,
I know she is to make it,

1109
01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:50.990
to see him like,
you know,
oh,
or do you really not love me now?

1110
01:08:51.230 --> 01:08:54.470
Because you know you're not following this diet that we agree that you would

1111
01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:59.060
like.
That's not,
that's not a fair comparison to make on somebody.

1112
01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.900
Like that's not,
it's really not fair to do that.
No,
it's,

1113
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:04.730
is it fair to do what she's going?
Well,
it's,

1114
01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:08.690
she's not doing it against like against him and as,

1115
01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:11.970
as a way to hurt him.
I know she has.
So you can't see,

1116
01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.440
you can't say is it fair for her to be doing that to him?

1117
01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.200
But this was this classic fucking female thing.
We,

1118
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.720
you guys are right when you're right and you're right when you're wrong.

1119
01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:27.760
Like you're acting like she's doing this to hurt him.
Well,

1120
01:09:27.761 --> 01:09:30.880
why can't she be a little more mature?
Just we've just say like,
listen,

1121
01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.260
why can't she sit down with him and just level with him and let him know?

1122
01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:39.340
Just say,
listen,
I gotta be honest with you.
I know that you care about me.

1123
01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.770
I know that you sat down and you had this,

1124
01:09:41.830 --> 01:09:45.880
this conversation with me and I know that I said going to do this,
this and this,

1125
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:50.970
but I'm actually doing that and I'm actually not going to the gym and I feel bad

1126
01:09:51.431 --> 01:09:54.280
that you're wasting your money and all that and you're taking all this time to

1127
01:09:54.281 --> 01:09:57.310
make a lunch every morning.
How loving is that that he's doing that?

1128
01:09:57.610 --> 01:10:01.600
She shouldn't do that.
All right then she's not 100% free of guilt.

1129
01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.900
The thing about it is Nia,
is that guys are guys,

1130
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.670
and we talk like guys and guys just get to the fucking heart of the matter.

1131
01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:11.590
I don't want it that bad.
What is it?

1132
01:10:11.591 --> 01:10:14.810
He looked at her bank statements from last module,

1133
01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.600
pick up fast food on her way nearly every day.
I gotta tell you.
Yeah,

1134
01:10:18.601 --> 01:10:22.820
that's a chick thing to do.
Go through somebody's email and snoop.
Yeah,
no it is.

1135
01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.910
It's snow.
But now you know you don't like that.
And then what if a woman did?

1136
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.950
You probably wouldn't like it.
No,
I don't.
I she,
she had a hunch.
No I don't.

1137
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.700
I have friends who checks.
Right.
And I don't,
I don't think it's smart to do.

1138
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.050
I think it's ridiculous.

1139
01:10:36.051 --> 01:10:39.620
And also it's like don't look cause you more than likely going to see something

1140
01:10:39.621 --> 01:10:41.850
that you don't want to be checking your emails later on.
Yeah,

1141
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.690
I have nothing to hide all my doing a situation.

1142
01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:53.020
Well first of all I should probably apologize for saying fuck you and calling

1143
01:10:53.021 --> 01:10:56.050
you an asshole.
Um,
but yeah,

1144
01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:59.170
you should just have sit down and have a talk with her and just say I'm

1145
01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:03.100
concerned about you and what's,
what's going on with you emotionally?

1146
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:06.220
Like tell me what's going on.
How does he deal with,

1147
01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:10.150
maybe we can like go for a walk after work and you can tell me about your day

1148
01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.350
when he wakes up,

1149
01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:16.260
when he brings up the fact that he snooped and looked at a bank state does not

1150
01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:17.880
need to do that.
Well let's just do,

1151
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.750
let's just say he does cause at this point now his girlfriend,

1152
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:24.540
because she's going to freak out and she can get a lot of weight behind those

1153
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:25.374
punches now.

1154
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:32.940
Um,
now he should just say,

1155
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:36.950
I'm worried about you because I feel like you're,

1156
01:11:36.951 --> 01:11:39.360
you're going through some stuff and I tried to help you,

1157
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.270
but maybe it's not enough.
Do you want to talk to me?

1158
01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:45.150
Do you want to talk to somebody else?
How do you,
how are you feeling?

1159
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.560
Cause she probably feels about herself.

1160
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:51.210
She probably feels terrible about herself.
She's gained that much weight.

1161
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.300
None of her clothes fit anymore.
She knows how she looks.

1162
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.580
She probably feels absolutely terrible.

1163
01:11:56.581 --> 01:12:00.630
And her one solves is that she's got this boyfriend who's home and he cares

1164
01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:04.330
about her and he loves her and she's abuser.
That's not,

1165
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.340
you don't throw that word around take long.

1166
01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:11.680
We're just taking an amazing him.
She's taking advantage,

1167
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.000
taking advantage of their love.
She's not,
you're making it.
That's what I don't.

1168
01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:20.860
So she's not trying to hurt him by doing that.
She's hurting.

1169
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.860
And you don't know him.
Exactly.
So why are you writing?
And I'm wrong.
I'm not,

1170
01:12:26.861 --> 01:12:29.850
I'm not saying I'm right.
I'm giving you my IP.
Isn't that why I'm here?

1171
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:33.150
You really have a beautiful profile,
you know?
Um,

1172
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:37.890
don't try to throw me upstairs anyway.
Shade them,
but don't try to throw me off.

1173
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:42.300
All right.
That wasn't legitimate thought,
but I was trying to throw you off.
No,

1174
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:44.190
listen if,
um,

1175
01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.190
listen fucker,
I was going to say

1176
01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.630
it would be very hard for a what we were just talking about.
No,

1177
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.800
she probably feels bad for herself.
She's probably blah,
blah blah.

1178
01:12:58.230 --> 01:12:59.550
Here's something.
What if she doesn't?

1179
01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.060
What if she doesn't give a fuck all those people,

1180
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:05.790
how do you know there aren't those people just don't give a fuck cause she's a

1181
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:09.810
woman.
She's five,
three and just put on more than like 10 pounds,
which is,

1182
01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.380
it's just devastating for that.
I'm five,
four and I have been,

1183
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:18.120
what about 25 pounds heavier?
I understand.
They'll look good though.

1184
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.330
You lays me when I was a little bit heavier.
Yeah,
I would say,

1185
01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.360
I don't want to say you liked it when I was a little bit thicker.
So listen,

1186
01:13:24.361 --> 01:13:28.800
I under his eye and it does show it.
It shows like nobody's business.

1187
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:32.040
You are right sir.
It,
it shows,
um,

1188
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:37.130
and to have your formerly tight hot body girlfriend all of a sudden not be that

1189
01:13:38.131 --> 01:13:39.880
way.
I know.
And she looks,

1190
01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:44.970
she looks like she's a retired athlete in her 50s,
at 24.
I mean,

1191
01:13:44.971 --> 01:13:49.360
what is he supposed to do?
He gets 27 so what,

1192
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.040
so he is still at that shallow age where he's like,
you know,

1193
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.000
calling into question is relationship based on your partner's weight gain?
No.

1194
01:13:57.001 --> 01:14:00.570
That,
that's,
that's the level of maturity.
And he's at,
they had,
that's yeah.

1195
01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:05.730
Listen,
that's a very serious fucking thing to be that,

1196
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.950
that overweight at that age.
I mean,

1197
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.040
if you do that to your body and you stay that way for 20 years,

1198
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:13.670
<v 1>I mean it's</v>

1199
01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:15.970
<v 0>okay.</v>

1200
01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:19.020
<v 1>Your body can only take that for so long.</v>

1201
01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.450
And when you're thinking about starting a family with somebody,

1202
01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.700
they have to be around.
They got to be involved.
They can't be over in the corner,

1203
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:31.030
<v 6>you know,
with no energy,
lethargic and,
and,
and,</v>

1204
01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:34.120
and then have on top of that all kinds of fucking hell.
That's another thing too.

1205
01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:38.290
Yeah.
You're not gonna be able to get fucking health insurance
mean.

1206
01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:40.840
What she's doing is really is effective.
Both of them,

1207
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:44.200
I'm not trying to be a dick here,
but like they're not even engaged though.

1208
01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:46.720
This is his girlfriend.
That's how you get is really lose weight.

1209
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:51.850
You should propose.
So please wait with the quickness.
Just me.
I know.

1210
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.450
Yeah.
But then once they get married,
she's going to go right back to Doritos.

1211
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:56.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1212
01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.550
<v 6>Well then that just,
that just means that there is a,</v>

1213
01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:03.570
a significant emotional thing that needs to be addressed.

1214
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:07.000
So all that stuff that you did while you got,
um,

1215
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:11.220
this great bike in a gym membership and all that stuff to support,
first of all,

1216
01:15:11.221 --> 01:15:11.760
that should,

1217
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.620
that should tell you that a person is only going to change their lifestyle if

1218
01:15:16.621 --> 01:15:19.080
they want to.
Number one.
That's the first lesson.

1219
01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.930
That's what drugs or food or anything.
Number two,

1220
01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:26.970
that that means you need to go deeper than just the kind of like these are the

1221
01:15:26.971 --> 01:15:28.200
things they do and get healthy.

1222
01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:32.670
That means they're either talking or you're suggesting therapy or you go to

1223
01:15:32.671 --> 01:15:36.270
therapy to talk to talk about it or something.
She probably needs to,

1224
01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:40.950
if she's got like some sort of like eating,
I have food addiction or something,

1225
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:44.160
I got the,
you know,
she's probably just fucking depressed.
When you're depressed,

1226
01:15:44.161 --> 01:15:48.450
you smoke weed and you gain weight.
Like she's depressed,
he needs stressed out.

1227
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:53.610
<v 1>He needs to sit down and decide if it's worth it.</v>

1228
01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:59.680
If this,
does he love this person enough to ride through this fucking store?

1229
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:03.290
<v 0>If,
if,</v>

1230
01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:09.210
<v 6>if you're not,
if you don't feel that way,
then you should just walk.
Okay.</v>

1231
01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.373
And then,

1232
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.610
<v 0>okay.</v>

1233
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:16.320
<v 1>Breaking her heart is better than marrying her and when you don't love her.</v>

1234
01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:19.440
So just break her heart.
The stress of that and the sadness of that.

1235
01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:22.770
She won't even be able to eat that big king every day and should probably drop

1236
01:16:22.771 --> 01:16:23.604
like 15

1237
01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.650
<v 6>it has.
He has,
he stopped loving her</v>

1238
01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:31.830
because if that's the case,
then he's calling their relationship into question.

1239
01:16:31.831 --> 01:16:36.480
So I don't know why,
because he's being honest.

1240
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.950
Why can't you fucking be honest?

1241
01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:41.720
Why can't guys be these deep who we are we,

1242
01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.590
we are visually you don't.

1243
01:16:43.591 --> 01:16:48.591
I love about women is you fucking want to use that shit where visually

1244
01:16:49.081 --> 01:16:53.670
attractive gets you a fucking drink or get your get your honest centric.

1245
01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.800
What do you mean?
Like that doesn't fucking work.

1246
01:16:55.801 --> 01:16:58.620
You want to use it when it works for you and then you want to,

1247
01:16:58.621 --> 01:17:02.190
you want to use that weakness when it's to your fucking advantage.

1248
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.360
And then once the other way,

1249
01:17:03.361 --> 01:17:06.390
you want us to be these fucking understanding God damn people,

1250
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:07.680
<v 0>okay.</v>

1251
01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.370
<v 6>Want us to be guys,
when it gets you a free fucking drink.</v>

1252
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:12.320
We want guys to love us.

1253
01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:16.370
Whether we're like the hot body or we gained some weight.
That's what we want.

1254
01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:19.480
We want some 90 that you want your cake and eat.
No,
we want,

1255
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.220
we want to live in a world where we don't have to even fucking have this

1256
01:17:25.221 --> 01:17:26.090
conversation.

1257
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:30.910
That's what I want to be rude and fat in,
in,

1258
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.140
in Shell job.
Actually do whatever I want to do.

1259
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.540
You're rude and fat and disgusting and ridiculous and you get to do that.
Well,

1260
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:44.660
women can't do that.
As you went to Rup mic,
we have to be like the hot body.

1261
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:49.520
Otherwise you call our relationship into question.
Oh,
so this one guy is,

1262
01:17:49.521 --> 01:17:52.790
everybody know he's not everybody,
but we're just,

1263
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:56.840
we're talking about just a general,
you know what you just said.

1264
01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.440
Women like to do this and women like to do that.
Like it's all women.

1265
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.380
That's what I do.
That's what I do.
Yeah.
But I'm a moron.

1266
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:06.590
You're supposed to be a higher being you a female.
We are higher beings.

1267
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:11.460
You're not just us.
Not just as dumb as we are,
just of different areas.
You know.

1268
01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:14.560
You don't think so.
No.
Being him being an emotional person,

1269
01:18:14.561 --> 01:18:19.561
it makes you tuned in to things that you as a male with your basic fucking

1270
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.050
basicness can't understand.

1271
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:27.140
So we already are high and we can like carry children.

1272
01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:30.280
We've got some spiritual level shit that you'll never understand.
Exactly.

1273
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:31.760
<v 1>And you know,
we also have,</v>

1274
01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.180
we have some plow through some shit that you don't understand

1275
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:41.170
<v 6>that you don't understand.
Loudly.
Associate an emotion finish of fucking thought.</v>

1276
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.070
No.
Yeah,
you have.
Can you be a plow through shit and an emotional,

1277
01:18:45.071 --> 01:18:46.840
you need both of those things,
don't you think?

1278
01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.270
<v 1>Yeah,
it's called the ying and the Yang,</v>

1279
01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:52.140
but for some reason you think your Yang is better than my Yang and that's the

1280
01:18:52.141 --> 01:18:55.320
fucking problem.
And it's 50,000 shows on fucking TV.

1281
01:18:55.321 --> 01:18:58.710
As much as you ladies complain about the images on TV.

1282
01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:03.000
This is zillion fucking things on TV that are telling you that you guys are

1283
01:19:03.001 --> 01:19:04.410
right and guys are morons.

1284
01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.550
Start with 90% of the fucking advertising when they show a man and a fucking

1285
01:19:08.551 --> 01:19:12.720
woman in a relationship like that ridiculous one from a few years ago that I'll

1286
01:19:12.721 --> 01:19:16.680
never fucking believe that they were actually where she's sitting at the

1287
01:19:16.681 --> 01:19:21.681
computer and the guys outside finds a beehive and literally sticks a broom

1288
01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:26.721
handle up into the fucking thing and it's getting stung by bees cause he's a

1289
01:19:27.481 --> 01:19:31.110
dumb guy and she has to sit down and handle the family business at the fucking

1290
01:19:31.111 --> 01:19:34.350
computer.
Okay,
please do the female,

1291
01:19:34.351 --> 01:19:38.090
the chauvinist Dick version of that fucking commercial.
What do you mean?

1292
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:39.460
Do show a sip version that

1293
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.140
<v 6>when they'll have the guy that's the guy</v>

1294
01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:45.290
<v 1>figuring out the family business on a fucking computer.</v>

1295
01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:49.930
Is she sitting there a lot of looking through a fashion magazine or that's just

1296
01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:52.040
not selling,
but at the same level of ridiculousness.

1297
01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.250
What is the female version of sticking a broom handle?
Lindell fucking beehive.

1298
01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.620
<v 6>They're assuming that the woman is taken care of like the day to day run the</v>

1299
01:19:59.621 --> 01:20:03.720
household stuff that the man is trying to be working.
No.

1300
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:08.090
So there wasn't a metaphor.
So they're trying to appeal to a woman's so that

1301
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:11.570
<v 1>she'll like the product and then she'll buy it.
It's all like,</v>

1302
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:13.740
what about Savannah market?
No,
it is not like,

1303
01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.250
what about the metaphor that's going on there?
That he's such a moron.

1304
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.600
He's trying to stick his fucking pull into any goddamn yeah.

1305
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.530
<v 6>Holy Cow.
That's not knowing.
Not knowing you can get stung at anymore.
Yeah.</v>

1306
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:27.060
I was him getting herpes.

1307
01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:31.120
<v 1>Uh dear Billy bounce.
What music are you listening to these days?</v>

1308
01:20:31.121 --> 01:20:33.820
What's on your iPod?
What's the lovely Neil listening to?

1309
01:20:33.821 --> 01:20:37.930
What do you listen to when you work out?
Chiseled,
meet Marvin Body.

1310
01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.370
It's as old as Lee Marvins party.
Um,

1311
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:45.940
what am I listening to these days?
I don't fucking know.

1312
01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1313
01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:51.250
<v 1>What am I usually listen to shift that makes me want to play drums,
uh,</v>

1314
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.300
or learns some drunk shit.

1315
01:20:53.301 --> 01:20:58.301
So I have no idea what's last night he actually watched,

1316
01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:03.230
we're watching comedy central because we weren't,
we were,
uh,
their website.

1317
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.900
Like jet lag.
Yeah.
I couldn't sleep.

1318
01:21:05.901 --> 01:21:10.901
And when I watch key and Peele and I watched the workaholics and a broad city,

1319
01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.550
when I watched all that did was make me feel fucking old.

1320
01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:25.370
It made me feel fucking old.
Like,
uh,
I mean I love let me get back.

1321
01:21:25.371 --> 01:21:27.380
So they're all fucking hilarious.

1322
01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.970
Like I was legitimately left laughing through all of that,
right?
Yeah.
Okay.

1323
01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.650
But I didn't get,

1324
01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.860
I didn't get so much of this shit not going to get it.

1325
01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:42.850
Like what was that thing that handle Burress thing that he said?

1326
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:47.110
I didn't even get it.
Oh yeah.
He was talking about Childish Gambino,

1327
01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.040
Donald Glover.

1328
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:53.080
<v 6>It was an interview with nerve.com that handle birthday and it was like we asked</v>

1329
01:21:53.081 --> 01:21:57.220
and Hannibal Burress for sex advice and in the end they would ask him if he

1330
01:21:57.221 --> 01:22:00.370
would want to do like a mix tape and if you wrap this and now he's like,
yeah,

1331
01:22:00.371 --> 01:22:01.970
I thought about it but I'm not going to,
you know,

1332
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:04.780
go for like childish Gambino and this and that and the other.

1333
01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.180
And then he made a reference to like,
you know,
oh,

1334
01:22:07.181 --> 01:22:11.160
we figured out like childish Gambino,
Israeli,
like bill bird and that's it.

1335
01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:16.000
That's done.
Or like when he does stand up and you just could not understand,

1336
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:19.330
no matter how many times I tried to explain to you what was he making fun.

1337
01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:22.720
Is that a,
is that a compliment that Donald was,

1338
01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.890
that Donald Glover is also childish Gambino or you just didn't eat,

1339
01:22:26.891 --> 01:22:27.700
didn't seem to,

1340
01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.760
<v 1>it's the whole time I heard Donald Glover,
all I was picturing was Danny.
Yeah,</v>

1341
01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:36.710
<v 6>no,
and it's Donald Glover.
Yeah.</v>

1342
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:39.740
<v 1>Oh my God.
And then the Kroll show,
Jesus Christ.</v>

1343
01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:43.410
<v 6>Everything on the Kroll show is hilarious.
I mean going on,</v>

1344
01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.730
what am I listening to since they were asking you when is a lovely meal?

1345
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.900
Listen to,
um,

1346
01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:53.020
I actually downloaded Sam Smith album based on his performance when Lucy kids

1347
01:22:53.451 --> 01:22:58.030
did SNL.
Actually it was another recent appearance that alluded.

1348
01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.970
It wasn't the first time around.
Um,
so Sam Smith is awesome.

1349
01:23:01.971 --> 01:23:03.110
Just has a beautiful voice.

1350
01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:07.090
I'm actually been making a lot of mixes of like old stuff,

1351
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:10.330
a lot of old hip hop.
I've been listening to a lot like nineties.

1352
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:15.310
I love that though.
What makes hip hop hip hop?
Um,
but I love,
I love,

1353
01:23:15.311 --> 01:23:19.540
um,
what's the like the latest like maybe um,

1354
01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:24.490
Pusha t his album is like,
it's something that I listened to her lover.

1355
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:29.620
I have no idea who I played.
I played it for you.

1356
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:34.240
You liked a couple of his,
his versus,
but overall,

1357
01:23:34.241 --> 01:23:38.500
I don't think you were into it cause you're not really into hip like rap music

1358
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:39.334
right now.

1359
01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:40.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1360
01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:45.120
<v 6>Right.
Would you say
I,
you know,
I,
I,</v>

1361
01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.880
I can't get,
I can't listen to it.

1362
01:23:47.881 --> 01:23:51.660
If you're going to fucking walk around your house or your apartment,

1363
01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:54.330
talking about all this stuff that you have in there,

1364
01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:59.100
it's just boring as shit to me.
Um,
I like storytellers.

1365
01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:02.580
I will never like those,
those guys that tell stories,

1366
01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.770
you know about guns and selling drugs if it's actually real.

1367
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:11.220
It sounds real.
Like they actually did.

1368
01:24:11.221 --> 01:24:15.180
That's why I love Jay z and Biggie because they actually did that shit and then

1369
01:24:15.181 --> 01:24:18.780
they talked about it and it was like listening to a movie.

1370
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.250
I liked that stuff.
Um,

1371
01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:24.913
<v 0>you know,</v>

1372
01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:26.690
<v 6>but she don't like,
I don't like,</v>

1373
01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:31.850
I don't [inaudible] was so far up his own ass.

1374
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:35.670
I,
it's just like,
it's true.
Yeah.
I never heard of like,

1375
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:40.430
who walks around called himself a genius.
Who does that?

1376
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:43.340
I mean this like right there.
You're not a genius.

1377
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:49.190
You're an idiot.
Like I don't,
and I don't understand what it,

1378
01:24:49.191 --> 01:24:53.330
I hate when he also stretches out the words.
It's like,

1379
01:24:53.331 --> 01:24:54.860
what are you trying to dumb it down for me?

1380
01:24:54.861 --> 01:24:58.190
You either don't have enough material for this fucking song to finish it.

1381
01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:00.620
It's a style.
It's like,
Eh,
you know,

1382
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.410
what do you

1383
01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:11.990
get the fucking one that I listened to cause they're like,

1384
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:15.960
oh my God.
Talking about being apropos.
It's,

1385
01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.020
I believe it's called Edwards in Paris.
Yes.
Um,

1386
01:25:20.770 --> 01:25:23.450
in Paris.
Uh,
yeah,

1387
01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:27.950
there's a part of the film where he stretches out like Jay z kills it and then

1388
01:25:27.951 --> 01:25:29.620
he comes on any starts,

1389
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:34.700
we get married at the mom or dad they deal with.
Uh,

1390
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.750
and it just keeps going and going and going like,
and I just feel like,

1391
01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.350
and it stinks.

1392
01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.010
It's not clever and he's slowing it down like I'm supposed to be on the other

1393
01:25:46.011 --> 01:25:47.360
end.
I'm like,
oh

1394
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:55.890
well whatever.
I'm sure a Zillion,
Tanya can't be wrong.

1395
01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.990
He's a genius.
Saint Vincent as another one.

1396
01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:04.070
I guess the most contemporary thing

1397
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.070
<v 8>I've listened to in the past couple of years is probably not the new math.</v>

1398
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:07.611
And that's the only,

1399
01:26:07.611 --> 01:26:11.300
because Andrew who does the podcast told me to check them off and say drama is

1400
01:26:11.301 --> 01:26:12.040
fucking awesome.

1401
01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.920
<v 1>Andrew them less has wonderful taste in music.
Can we just say that on all right,</v>

1402
01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.050
we've got to wrap this up.
Yeah.

1403
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:20.530
Cause we got to go look at that arrogant brought down.

1404
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:26.410
Um Oh,
before I end,

1405
01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:30.820
<v 8>I got to a just unbelievable sad day in comedy yesterday.</v>

1406
01:26:30.821 --> 01:26:34.950
The Great John Pinette uh,
passed away and I got to tell you,

1407
01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:39.310
I got to your great jump and that story.
He was just an unbelievable guy.

1408
01:26:39.730 --> 01:26:42.880
I only,
I only got to meet him a handful of times,
but he's one of those guys.

1409
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:45.280
You met him the first time.
It's like,
you know,
you know,
like Cliche,

1410
01:26:45.281 --> 01:26:48.130
like you know,
forever.
First Time I ever saw him I had already,

1411
01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:53.150
all he heard was the legend of John Fernet where basically he started doing

1412
01:26:53.981 --> 01:26:58.420
comedy and like within six months was headline because he had,

1413
01:26:58.421 --> 01:27:00.820
he didn't have the material yet cause you don't even do want to six months.

1414
01:27:00.821 --> 01:27:03.680
But his charisma and how hard he was killing it,

1415
01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:08.620
he was just such a natural that we're in Boston where it was just such,

1416
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:13.150
we like headlining was so solidified.
Like you,
you,
like we always said,

1417
01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:14.140
by the time we came around,

1418
01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:18.300
you had to leave Boston to headline Boston because the,

1419
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:22.210
the Boston comedy gods weren't leaving and you weren't going to get funnier than

1420
01:27:22.211 --> 01:27:26.440
them.
So you had to go out and get TV credits to just do a headlining set at the

1421
01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:29.860
fucking comedy fall.
Uh,
but John Pinette was so funny.

1422
01:27:29.861 --> 01:27:33.070
He plowed through all of that in six months.

1423
01:27:33.071 --> 01:27:36.410
In the first time I see the guy to hearing the legend of the guy.
Um,
it,

1424
01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:40.330
Nick's comedy stop,
uh,
on Kevin Knox,
his show.

1425
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:43.170
And this is after the standup boom ended,

1426
01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:46.330
the eighties ended in the early nineties when I started out.
So,

1427
01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.230
and they didn't learn how to promote a club because they never had to because

1428
01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:53.200
people just went to comedy clubs.
So now for the first time ever,

1429
01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.820
they had to learn how to promote and they was still learning.

1430
01:27:54.821 --> 01:27:57.520
So long story short,
it was a Tuesday night at Nick's,

1431
01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:00.370
it was maybe 28 people in the crowd.

1432
01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:05.800
And John Pinette comes in and just says,
Hey,
can I get up and do some time?

1433
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:10.950
And they put them on and I watched him and he did 12 minutes and he made those

1434
01:28:12.791 --> 01:28:16.960
28 people.
It sounded like a fucking jet was landing.

1435
01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.600
He had them dying laughing and he got us

1436
01:28:19.650 --> 01:28:21.180
<v 1>standing ovation.
Hmm.</v>

1437
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:26.510
Like he had done like a 90 minute blistering set just doing 12 minutes just,

1438
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:31.050
and it was one of those things I had never seen anybody get a standing ovation,

1439
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:34.380
but I knew what the end,
they were going to stand up.
And I remember he just,

1440
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:37.210
he just went on,
he just kinda like sit down,
sit down,

1441
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:42.110
<v 8>smell going,
like what the fuck was that?
And um,</v>

1442
01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:48.080
fortunately I never had to try to follow them.
I did one show with him,

1443
01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.980
um,
I can't remember where the hell we were.
It was me,
him,

1444
01:28:51.981 --> 01:28:55.550
Kathleen Madigan was just a fucking great line up of people.

1445
01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:59.210
And like he closed it in Jesus Christ.

1446
01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:03.690
He was one of those guys that he would,
and that's that Boston style.
It's like,

1447
01:29:03.691 --> 01:29:07.320
I got you and I'm not letting you go and I'm not letting you get up.

1448
01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.860
And like nobody was the epitome of that more than them.

1449
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:14.970
So going to miss your buddy,
and that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1450
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.510
Um,
don't take any shit.
Don't fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
Mona.

1451
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.020
Lisa.
