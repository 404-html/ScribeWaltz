00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.400
Hey,

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.430
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.290
I'm just checking in on you,
checking you to sell my voices junk.

4
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:18.240
I just did six shows up in San Jose.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.860
<v 1>Hey,</v>

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.420
<v 0>I've been for the Houston Astros so it was one of my favorite players.
Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.300
my voice is going to be a little tight.
It's gonna be a little rough,
you know.
Um,

8
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.680
I did six shows up there to Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday,

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.400
just like when I was in Phoenix to Monday to Tuesday to fucking Wednesday.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.700
I'm putting together my new a hour and I really felt by Wednesday of this week

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.840
it had gotten to the point we're starting to do,
starting to take shape.

12
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:49.890
And I was very happy and I want to thank everybody who came out,
you know,

13
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:50.790
on school nights.

14
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:53.490
I know you guys all have to work unless you hit the fucking lottery.

15
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.320
I assumed all he had to go to work the next day.

16
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:59.760
So I want to thank everyone in San Jose who came out to go see me.

17
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.130
And,
um,
thank you for sitting through the new jokes.
I had a great time up there.

18
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.080
Worked with Dean del,
you fucking crushed it,
crushed it all fucking week.

19
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.580
Um,
had a great time working with them,
you know,
and dean,
like,

20
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.750
this is the funny thing about team when I worked with Dean Dean,
you know,

21
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.480
he doesn't party or anything like that.
He's done all of that shit.

22
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:25.470
So He's over it.
So then,
you know,
I'm,
I'm a fucking codependent jackass,

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.250
you know what I mean?
So I mean,
to a point,
someone's doing cocaine,
heroin,

24
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm like,
Hey,
I'm going to bed.
Okay.
Um,

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.190
but it's when it comes to the booze was smoking cigars,
right.
That's why,

26
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.810
you know,
me and all my friends,
I mean,

27
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:43.410
we're all codependent guys and we just fucking feed off of each other and it

28
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:47.700
becomes fucking,
you know,
animal house.
But,
um,
so he,
he's,

29
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.230
he doesn't do that.
Right.
So my os can be great.
You know,

30
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:54.210
I'm not going to spend any extra money and no extra calories.

31
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:56.340
I was hitting the gym,
was doing everything great.
But a,

32
00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:01.341
the thing about dean is he has impeccable taste in shit that I like old

33
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:04.020
instruments,
old cars.

34
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.740
He was showing me this guy that fucking read does these portion nine eleven's

35
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.300
out here that would just fucking insane,
insane.

36
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.190
Like he has all like,
you know,

37
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.370
not a lot of stuff but he has all top of the line shit.

38
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.161
So I was joking with them,

39
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:21.570
I was like all the money that I'm going to fucking not blowing a bar after my

40
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:25.530
show.
I'm then going to spend 10 times more that on fucking Ebay after I get done

41
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.350
talking to you.
But um,
anyways,
he murdered at all week.

42
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:31.830
We had such a great time in San Jose in front.

43
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:33.960
That's one of my favorite places because it's really,
it's really,

44
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:38.730
it's a small theater,
you know,
from the turn of the last century,

45
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:43.470
I believe it was built in the 1890s burned down back when shit used to burn down

46
00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:46.320
all the time cause it was may not of fucking wood,
you know,

47
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.350
as opposed to what now bill,
I don't know.
We did,
they didn't have sprinklers.

48
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.550
That's what it was.
What a houses man out of plastic bill.

49
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.840
You know,
you've been on a Hollywood so long,
you plastic phony,

50
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:01.660
you think everything's made out of plastic.
Well then they would melt.
Right?

51
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.790
Plastic is it flammable?
But I could just cowers you know what I mean?

52
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.970
Like your friend who says,
I got your back.
I'm not going to fucking rent.
Yeah.

53
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.980
Then all of a sudden the teacher comes walking in and he goes,

54
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.960
he always his idea,
that's what plastic is.
You know,
why?

55
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.600
Cause it's manmade.
Um,
anyways,

56
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:23.140
so it burned down and then they rebuilt it in the early 19 hundreds and everyone

57
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:27.190
from like Harry Houdini,
Charlie Chaplin,
they always bring up those two guys.

58
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:31.120
Nobody ever says,
uh,
you know,
fatty Arbuckle played here.
Nobody gives a shit.

59
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.650
Right.
I love that name.
Fatty Arbuckle.
You know,
that's back when you just,

60
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.360
you said what the person was for better for worse.
You know what I mean?
You know,

61
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.490
you could just say get fatty Arbuckle.
Why?
Cause cause he's a fat fuck.
You know?

62
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.970
Sure.
He had a first name.
Nobody knows what it is,
but people go,
you know,

63
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.130
back then it was great,
you know,
you fucking,
yeah,

64
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.860
but then people also walk around,
drop for the fucking Edward,
you know,

65
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:58.630
like they were saying pass the sugar.
But the upside to that was you,

66
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.580
you knew who sought what as opposed to now where he goes,
African American,

67
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.760
a homosexual America,
Japanese Americans,
and you have no idea who's what.

68
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:09.550
Everybody's walking around and you feel like you're in the fucking invasion of

69
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:12.310
the body snatchers.
Who's thinking what?
Right.

70
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.820
Everybody's reading from the same book.
It's not good God damn thing.

71
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.480
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about right now.
Um,

72
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:22.180
I literally got off,
got on the earliest flight.

73
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.150
I'm doing this thing now because I want to run home,

74
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.620
rush home and see my daughter,
my daughter.

75
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.310
But I get home cause I take the earliest flight out and I'm fucking exhausted.

76
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:35.200
Then I have to go to sleep.
So I'm
sucks.
I came home.

77
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:38.860
I think she has to remember who I am just three days away,
three days away.

78
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:43.360
Like as far as what percentage of her life she was looking at me like making

79
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.330
this face like who the fuck is this guy?
She didn't cry.

80
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:48.130
Thank God they would have broke my heart,
but you know,

81
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.030
it took me like 20 minutes to get a smile out of her.
Um,

82
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.340
what else am I going to do?
One at nine to five job,
you know,

83
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.720
drive a fucking
Chevy Cavalier.

84
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.740
Like what?
What the fuck a lot of you guys are doing right now.
Stuck in traffic.

85
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.420
I know you don't want to do that,
right?
You got to dream.

86
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.790
Let me tell you something.
You got to,
you got to find that dream.

87
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.040
You got to go after it.
Um,
okay.
Uh,
do whatever the fuck you want to do.
You know,

88
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.190
this is a lot of times I look at somebody sitting in a cubicle and that would be

89
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.160
great right there.
I just fucking sit there.
I just,
I,

90
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:23.440
I go from here to right fucking there.
Right?

91
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:26.390
I just send my chair spins from this to here.
Right?

92
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.030
That's my range of fucking motion.

93
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.870
I get my job done and I go home and you know something that this country company

94
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.040
goes under.
I don't give a fuck.
I'll go,
I'll just go to another one.
Ain't on me,

95
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.710
you know,
not rent to own rental leaf.
That's how you'd do it anyways.

96
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.700
Uh,
what's going on in my world?
Other than that,
I'm excited.

97
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.880
Finally excited about my new hour.
Finally,

98
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.780

You know what I mean?

103
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.350
It's fucking crazy.
It's like,
what do you fucking 80 can't take the win anymore.

104
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:15.740
You got to lose your edge stowed.

105
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.040

00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.510
Fucking flip flops sitting down by a dog,

110
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:37.270

115
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:57.700
We lost Edmonton and then we went over to Edmonton,

116
00:06:57.701 --> 00:07:01.600
Alberta and then we went to Toronto,
Ontario and we fucking lost there.

117
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.600
And then we went to Ottawa,
the capital,
the capital,

118
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:08.440

121
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.200
And I could never fucking room room cause most of them begin with n full of old

New Brunswick.

123
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.220
Then there's something in Labrador retriever or some shit.

Newfoundland and Labrador.

125
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.330
Prince Edward Island.
And the rest easy.

126
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.980
You just go on across according to fucking hockey teams,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.490
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
None.
None of what?

141
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.420
Oh no,
that's not,
doesn't sound Italian.
Hey,
we'll have none of that.

142
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:44.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.140
<v 0>Knock it off.
None.
No,
none of that.
None of that would work.</v>

144
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.060
Fuck off.
I got most of them.
I got most of them.
All right.
So anyways,

145
00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:56.900
the Bruins were playing Tampa Bay tonight.
We need a win,
you know,

146
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.960
and we just fucking beat Edmonton.
We've just won one of those fucking gays.

147
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:03.260
We had little breathing room,
a little breathing Roman.
Now we don't.

148
00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:07.250
Now it's just like,
you know Joe Barton,
Dick taught me,
talked me off the ledge,

149
00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:10.280
she goes,
you know they will fucking tired.
They had back to back games.

150
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.410
Don't fucking it the bannock panic button yet.

151
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.630
Then we lost again to fucking Ottawa.
Okay.

152
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.360
So I'm gonna listen to Joe Barton it cause he knows way more about hockey than

153
00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:19.610
I'll ever fucking know.
But if they lose tonight,

154
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.420
<v 1>yeah.</v>

155
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.830
<v 0>Isn't this,</v>

156
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.740
we're looking at possibly three years in a row of being in the playoffs with two

157
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:28.620
weeks to go in March and then sitting at home.
You know,

158
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.190
which partner gets told me that's the worst fucking thing to just miss the

159
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:32.881
playoffs.
Okay.

160
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:35.820
Cause you don't get any play off money and you don't get a good draft pick.

161
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.340
But who knows?
Maybe somebody will miss somebody good.

162
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.010
I mean that's how we got Tom Brady,
right?

163
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.290
Everybody just fucking was looking at him like,
you know,

164
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.090
he's got a nice dimple in his chin.
But other than that,
I don't know.

165
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.500
You can see why they passed a bike and see why they passed a by when he fucking

166
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:56.610
dove after he threw that pick six,
you know,
and the Superbowl this year.

167
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.870
Just look that up.

168
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.880
Him diving to tackle and just look at how unathletic he looks.
You know,

169
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:06.270
anytime anybody ever says like fucking hot have fucked it.

170
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:09.480
All these teams way to the what?
What was he in the fourth round?
Six round.

171
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:14.160
How did they miss this guy?
Just show that video and just say,

172
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.890
imagine that running the 40 yard dash.

173
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.760
You know what Tom Brady is?
He's a fucking slave.

174
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.840
That's what he is.

175
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:28.290
He showed up looking like a Volvo station wagon and they didn't realize what was

176
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.120
under the hood.
You know what it was?

177
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:33.780
It was a four 54 454 cubic kid.

178
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:38.130
She's a fucking hat dude.
I'm sorry.
All right.

179
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:40.020
Plowing ahead.
Um,

180
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.810
other sports stock Formula One starts on this Sunday if you want to get into it

181
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.940
like I did last year and last year,

182
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:51.960
the Mercedes Benz team with Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg,

183
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:55.770
this sense retired.
Nico Rosberg cause he wanted to hang out with his daughter,

184
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.300
which I didn't fuck over his kid,

185
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:01.800
which I didn't understand until I came home after three days in San Jose and my

186
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:06.180
own daughter's looking at me like,
uh,
is this the driver?
Who the hell's this guy?

187
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.643
Um,

188
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.900
<v 1>okay.</v>

189
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.733
<v 0>Who knows?</v>

190
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.480
<v 0>I always,
I always want to blame the woman.
You know,
that his wife was like,</v>

192
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:17.900
it's really dangerous.
I mean,
you won the championship.
I mean,

193
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:20.850
this whole thing with Louis,
it's just,
it's,
it's,
it's,

194
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.950
you talk about it all the time.
We can't even sit down for a meal.
I get it.

195
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:28.610
You think he's a con?
But you know,
I just,
what about us?

196
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.950
Did you just be here with me?
Okay.
You know,

197
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.250
that's the danger of being with the wrong woman.
You,

198
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.180
you end up stepping out of a formula one car and just say,
Hey,
you know what?
Oh,

199
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.130
maybe he's smart.

200
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.370
Maybe he's just like that guy who plays blackjack and goes up early and just

201
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.410
says,
Hey,
you know what?
Fuck this.
I'm going back to the room,

202
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.860
taking my money and I'm going back to the fucking room.
I have no idea.

203
00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:52.170
I don't even understand this God damn sport to be honest with you.

204
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.580
I still don't what happened to the steering wheel and why it looks like a

205
00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:56.780
fucking game boy now.

206
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.470
And how the fuck sitting there like driving that Goddamn fast.

207
00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:06.020
You have time to take your hand off the wheel and fucking search for that button

208
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.100
to pick a new,
uh,
a new suspension.

209
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.820
Like you're in a Tesla with your friend driving up fucking route to,
hey,

210
00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:16.820
you want me to put it in an insane fucking mode?
Whatever the hell it is,

211
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.030
except they're doing this shit at 200 miles an hour.
By the way,

212
00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:25.031
I went by a Tesla dealership when I was up in San Jose and um,

213
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.930
they have,
uh,
they had the new one up there,
you know,
that had,
they had,
um,

214
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.770
you know,
the original one just had the motor,
um,
for the rear wheels.

215
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.760
Now they got one for the front and the back.
And evidently it goes,

216
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.780
we need to get the top of the line,
the best one,
right?
It's,

217
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.790
it's literally with them.
It's just like what,
what gives it,
um,

218
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.360
makes it worth more money is the amount of fucking electrical power you have.

219
00:12:53.361 --> 00:12:54.980
It's all of it.
Cause everything other than that,

220
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.000
I think they're pretty much all the same.
And if you get to top of the line one,

221
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.830
um,
it goes zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds.

222
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.420
That's like a fucking,
that's motorcycles level speed.
Um,

223
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.780
and it's a four door,
looks like a fucking Nissan maximum.
Not even now.

224
00:13:14.781 --> 00:13:15.531
It doesn't look like that.

225
00:13:15.531 --> 00:13:19.220
It looks like maybe like a Toyota super fucked in Nissan Masks.

226
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.420
Maximum one of those late.

227
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.963
<v 1>MMM,</v>

228
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:28.390
<v 0>late eighties once.
Um,
was it the super,
the Celica?</v>

229
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.700
I can't fucking remember.
All I know is,

230
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:35.020
you know what car I would love to fucking own for like a year is one of those

231
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.950
like a 71 or 72,
like Datsun five,
10.

232
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.710
Just have the whole fucking thing redone.
Um,
I gotta be honest with you.
I,
you're,

233
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:47.710
I'm hard pressed to find a fucking car that I,
that I can't see.

234
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.930
That wouldn't be fun to drive.
You know what I mean?

235
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.340
There's so many fucking great cars out there.
The only ones I,
I,

236
00:13:52.341 --> 00:13:55.720
I'm not really interested in is all the American muscle cars at this point,

237
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.450
because they're just fucking everywhere.
Everybody has one.

238
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.830
Every time you put on meek and we've got some mopar power coming up and it's the

239
00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:05.820
same guy.
He comes a Kudo.
It comes a fucking hand.

240
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.510
This hemi that it comes to Shelby,
he comes to fucking,
you know,

241
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:12.640
the daily made a couple of these Camaro's.

242
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.200
There's the 19 fucking 69 you know,
this is a Mustang boss.

243
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.480
It's the,
they're all fighting over the same fucking three models.
Meanwhile,

244
00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:25.540
there's all these other fucking coolest cars out there.
Um,

245
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:29.110
I'm actually glad that the baby boomers are still infatuate that cause it keeps

246
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:32.680
the prices down of the shit that I like.
Um,

247
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.600
yeah.
I'm a fucking Weirdo dude.
I like those.
Ford does Ford vans from the 60s.

248
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.420
You know,
it's just a shame that you know,

249
00:14:41.421 --> 00:14:46.130
a couple of fucking serial killers that dressed up like clowns drove around

250
00:14:46.131 --> 00:14:50.210
advanced,
they really ruined the name of them.
But what's the upside of that?

251
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.860
The
upside of pedophilia is if you're into vans,
you can get one for really cheap.

252
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.700
The trade off is you can never grow a mustache for the rest of your life.

253
00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.210
That's it.
Um,
anyway,

254
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:09.180
so formula one starts this Sunday in Australia and last year then,

255
00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.890
but Mercedes Benz teams where the a was where the um,
Mercedes Benz team,

256
00:15:13.891 --> 00:15:18.660
sorry,
was the team to beat.
And this year evidently the Ferrari's are uh,

257
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.100
are looking like they're going to be really strong and a,

258
00:15:23.101 --> 00:15:26.820
I guess everybody's rooting for.
Who the fuck is the Australian driver there for?

259
00:15:26.821 --> 00:15:31.060
The uh,
the red bull team.
He's coming down there.

260
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:35.400
What the fuck's his name?
What's his name?
Uh,

261
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.620
Daniel.
Ricardo.
Hello?

262
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.000
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

263
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.750
<v 0>you're getting ready to leave.
Does she still remember who I am?</v>

264
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.050
She was looking at me like,
who the hell is this guy?
All right sweetie.

265
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.740
Huh?
I get a smile.

266
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.370
Can I get us to staring at the microphone?
I liked that.

267
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:02.210
How are you going to get in show Biz treed may lago food.

268
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.200
Yeah.
I think she's kind of over me.
Let me hang with it for like two,

269
00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:10.460
three hours today.
Get that bond back.
Get the bond back.

270
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.830
<v 1>Yeah.
Can you say bye Bye Daddy?</v>

271
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.680
<v 0>She's just staring at it.
She'd read.
Look at a pillow then me.
Hey Buddy.</v>

272
00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:22.600
You remember me?
Look at me.
Who Do you think paid for that one?
Z.

273
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.370
That was me.
Nothing.
She's look looking down.

274
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:32.680
She's got no interest.
Unbelievable.
That's the kind of charisma half.
All right.

275
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.710
You guys go have fun.
I'll see you.
Bye everybody on the clock ass.
All right,

276
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.440
bye.
See you later to my two way.
Um,

277
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.340
all right.
So,
um,
she didn't look at me once.
Um,

278
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.450
whatever.
I understand.
Okay.
It's a brand new brain still working.

279
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.540
She's putting together her shit.
The way I'm putting together my act.

280
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.360
Either that or she already doesn't like me,
but you know,

281
00:16:58.361 --> 00:17:02.530
I really can't blame them.
Um,
Daniel Ricardo is the guy,

282
00:17:02.531 --> 00:17:07.510
but here's the thing about him.
Everybody in Australia claims that guy.
All right.

283
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.340
Which is bullshit I think because he didn't move to fucking Australia till he

284
00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:16.750
was seven.
He came from Sicily.
All right.
I bet.

285
00:17:16.751 --> 00:17:20.890
I bet he's got some stories about everybody teasing them with his fucking

286
00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:23.830
accident when he first showed up to Australia,
but he's got some stories.

287
00:17:23.831 --> 00:17:27.910
Any Sicilian,
so you know,
you know,
he never forgets,
but whatever.

288
00:17:27.911 --> 00:17:31.180
Australia would like your claim him maybe you got kicked out like all those

289
00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:35.620
bricks and sent to that fucking land.
Who knows?
But um,

290
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.280
so everybody's going to be pulling for him.
I can't fucking away.
I can't,

291
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:41.650
I can't believe how excited I am for this shit.

292
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.960
They finally stuck it through one of those whole seasons.

293
00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:48.300
Now I'm totally into it,
so I'm probably borne a lot of you.
But um,
oh no.
Sorry.

294
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.020
Let's get to the,
let's get this old bull shit here.
Um,

295
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.570
did I already talk about everything?
Oh,

296
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.680
you know what else I did when I was up there?
Um,
the Improv up,
they have found a,

297
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:03.420
a,
a drum room for me.
And on two days I got to play for two hours,

298
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:06.030
both fucking days.
I snuck four I was in,

299
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.610
that's what I do when I'm on the road cause I can't really play drums,
you know,

300
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.190
as much as I like,
which is basically an hour to two hours every fucking day.

301
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.380
I can't do that anymore.
Now I get out,
you know,

302
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:19.440
a couple a couple of days a week if I'm lucky.

303
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.330
But I got the whole practice pad kit and all that shit here.
So,
um,

304
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.950
I got to go out and do that shit.

305
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.800
See how awful my playing is now.
It was really fucking depressing,
you know,

306
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.250
but it was still a good time.
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Let's,
let's read.
Oh,

307
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.093
you know what?

308
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.940
I have announcements I have to do if I sound like I'm all over the place,

309
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:40.140
it's cause I got like two hours.

310
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.950
Fucking sleep flight was at like 6:50 AM you know,
I,

311
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.410
I never,
I usually don't do a podcast when I flew the same fucking day.
So.

312
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.090
All right.
What am I supposed to do here?
Oh,

313
00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:55.570
I've got to remind the listeners about,
uh,
Deanna Adler's,
Steven Adler,

314
00:18:55.571 --> 00:18:57.540
his mom.
Um,

315
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.830
I interviewed her with Steven Adler and um,
Jamie Adler,

316
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.560
um,
that was posted yesterday.
Please listen to it.
And um,

317
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:08.850
Steven's mother,

318
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.470
mother is going to be at Barnes and noble doing a book signing,

319
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.410
um,
a week from yesterday.

320
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:20.340
So that will be the 29th.

321
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:25.380
March 29th.
She's going to be there.
Let me,
but let me double check on them.

322
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:27.450
Make sure no,
fuck that up.
That would be a bad thing.

323
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.190
It would defeat the for purpose of them coming on here.
All right.
Where am I?

324
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.210
Where am I?
Um,
yeah,

325
00:19:36.211 --> 00:19:41.211
the 29th at 7:00 PM at the growth on Fairfax here in Los Angeles.

326
00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.870
Um,
she's going to be at the,
uh,

327
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:48.803
at the fucking,

328
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.520
at the God damn mall down there where they used to have two stadiums by the way.

329
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.200
These to have a football stadium down there and they used to have a baseball

330
00:19:58.201 --> 00:19:58.601
stadium.

331
00:19:58.601 --> 00:20:01.740
If you ever watched those old school black and white home run derbies and you

332
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:02.640
wonder where they are.

333
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:05.310
I always thought they were like in like the Washington Center to see original,

334
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.150
you know,
Washington senators ballpark.
But they were actually out here in la,

335
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:12.450
which makes sense because it's a fucking TV show.
Anyways,

336
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.110
now it's a CBS slot and we're all,
that shit stood,
you know,

337
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.560
they knocked it all down and then they did like 9 million episodes of the
prices.

338
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:24.360
Right.
So you know what the world moves ahead.
All right.
In don't Chai.

339
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.140
No,
sorry.
Just blew out your ear.
Drums.
Indochino everybody.

340
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.440
Geno talk about how um,

341
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.270
a made to measure suit fits compared to a generic off the rack suit and now

342
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:38.220
every man looks better in a suit.
Hey,

343
00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:41.220
why don't you fucking write something and I'll,
I'll read that.

344
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.920
I got to sit here and riff.
You know,

345
00:20:43.921 --> 00:20:46.710
they used to do that to comedians way back in the day.
They probably still do it.

346
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:50.980
We used to go on for commercial auditions and he'd show up and they,
you know,

347
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.450
there's no coffee,
there's no coffee.

348
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:56.320
They just want to see personality and then you go in there and you hold up the

349
00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:59.920
product and you'd sit there and riff and all this shit and then they would just

350
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:03.010
steal all your jokes.
They wouldn't hire you.
And then they'd write the copy.

351
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.270
Oh,
I think I told this story.

352
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.320
Patrice fucking called them out on it.
That's right.

353
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:14.110
I think I told this actually recently too much and I'm standing there.
He goes,

354
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.910
he just walked in like a can of coke and just stared all like three of them
down.

355
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:20.770
Just so what?
What is this horse shit?

356
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.540
They all imploded and told them exactly what the fuck they were doing.
All right.

357
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:30.050
Do I really need the riff about this?
Okay.
Do you know?
Unless you're,

358
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.130
unless you're fucking the exact same measurements of a mannequin,

359
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.950
you know you're not,
something's gonna look fucked up.

360
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:37.240
He just not going to look right.
Okay.

361
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:40.360
If you have a suit that's fucking tailor made your body,

362
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:45.100
obviously you have a buy a top for your car.
You know,

363
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:47.410
if you buy the one for your model,
your model car,

364
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:50.080
it fits like a glove as opposed to just getting some generic one.

365
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.330
It's a little gust of wind and it blows right off.

366
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.190
Do you want you suit pants to come flying off and then you Dick's Pekin outta

367
00:21:56.191 --> 00:22:00.550
your boxers at the Christmas party or do you want to fish soup?
Well,

368
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:04.690

371
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.860
Are there hundreds of fabrics?
How many are there?

372
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.320
It's like cotton silk and ray on in my world.
The fuck else is there?

373
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.030
Plastic leather.
Yeah,

374
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:29.230
that's it.
I thought there was less fabrics and it was fucking banks.

375
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.573
Um,

376

383
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:01.680
Yeah.

465
00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:21.050
shithole store that always has that sign up,

but that they're going out of business going out of business and they were in

467
00:28:24.381 --> 00:28:27.710
business for like another 10 years.
Um,
anyways,

468
00:28:27.711 --> 00:28:30.130

And so as computer consumer confidence,

472
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.480
but it takes a lot more than a good timing to launch a successful business.

487
00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.440
I could spend 20 minutes trying to break that fucking thing down.

488

Trying to figure is that a fragment?
Is that a run on?

490
00:29:40.671 --> 00:29:44.600

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.850

496
00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:06.830
zoom.com/startup oh guess what?
I wanted to thank somebody.

497
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.870
Somebody on Twitter sent me a,

498
00:30:11.871 --> 00:30:16.871
somebody uploaded an entire Boston Bruins versus Chicago Black Hawks from 1974

499
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.800
and it's the Bruins feed.
So it's Fred Q sick doing the game.

500
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:27.200
Spoiler alert,
the Chicago Blackhawks win the face off.

501
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.400
They win the draw,

502
00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.990
it goes back to stand Makita who shoots it down to the Bruins and,

503
00:30:32.991 --> 00:30:37.970
and it's then picked up by Bobby your and it's,
it's the whole fucking game.

504
00:30:37.971 --> 00:30:41.360
I just sat there and it's,
it's a great,
great quality.

505
00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.750
I hope nobody goes into fucking takes it down.
It's unbelievable.

506
00:30:44.751 --> 00:30:46.490
If you just want to check it out,
like,
um,

507
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:51.500
the first thing I always noticed decides from no helmets is like how small the

508
00:30:51.501 --> 00:30:55.970
goalies are.
So you can,
one of these guys scored like a fucking everybody,

509
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.930
you scoring 50 goals,

510
00:30:56.931 --> 00:31:01.250
but so many people scored 50 back then these guys barely took up.

511
00:31:01.251 --> 00:31:04.100
Like it looks like a third of the net standup goalies.
You know,

512
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.280
they played goalie,
they look,
they look like they're in the rock cats.

513
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:12.230
So just fucking kick their legs out and shit.
But it's,
it's,
so,
um,

514
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.520
I'll,
you know,
I'll actually,
I'll maybe I'll put a link to it,
um,

515
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.220
from the podcast.
Podcasts are at the MMP.
Is that what the Twitter is?

516
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:26.120
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
anyways,
that's the,
uh,

517
00:31:26.121 --> 00:31:29.120
that's the podcast here for this Thursday.
I got something I got to go do.

518
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.460
I apologize.
I know it was a little scatterbrained here,

519
00:31:31.461 --> 00:31:36.420
but however you can listen to some nice music and then listen to a podcast,
um,

520
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.410
from,
I don't know when,
I don't know when it's going to be.
It's from,

521
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.520
from yesteryear.
When I was a little bit younger,
my brain wasn't as scattered.

522
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.930
<v 2>Briana,
that's always been scatterbrained.
Who's getting to,
all right,</v>

523
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:48.880
please enjoy the next half of the podcast and

524
00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:51.730

You'd cut

525
00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:08.890
places with touches

526
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.270

529
00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:48.630
[inaudible].

530
00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.580
<v 3>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

531
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.840
The Monday morning podcast for a March 25th,
2009

532
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.460
fucking podcast is to start to feel like groundhog day for me.

533
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.700
Might be a little grumpy,
a little extra grumpy this week because,
uh,

534
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:20.190
I don't want what happened.
I,
uh,
well I do know what happened.
Um,

535
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:25.670
I went out drinking last night and I stayed out until about two in the morning

536
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:27.720
and,
uh,

537
00:33:27.721 --> 00:33:32.721
I was driving home and I saw a coyote and I slowed down and for some reason felt

538
00:33:32.791 --> 00:33:37.380
the need to yell at it in a,
just to see what it would do.

539
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.200
Because according to Black Comedians,

540
00:33:40.201 --> 00:33:43.170
that's what white people do around wild animals and God damn.

541
00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:48.160
And I am the stereotype
Parker Shi

542
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.500
[inaudible].

543
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.290
That's literally what the fuck I did.

544
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:06.291
I was a hacky def jam bit and those were two of the worst impressions of two

545
00:34:07.321 --> 00:34:12.120
races you're ever going to hear.
Um,
but go fuck yourself.
I'm still in my pajamas.

546
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.900
He wear pajamas bill.
Um,
when it's cold in my apartment,

547
00:34:15.901 --> 00:34:18.780
I do still comfortable with my sexuality.

548
00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.620
Let me tell you something.

549
00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.520
If you wear pajamas as a man and you don't have a child,

550
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.780
you're just,
you're a fucking,
I don't know what,
but you're not something,

551
00:34:30.781 --> 00:34:35.470
I want to be around these Pajama bottoms or my way of saying that I hate my

552
00:34:35.471 --> 00:34:40.290
shelf.
Oh,
Bill,
why would you say that?
Um,
anyways,

553
00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:44.820
yeah.
So I just pulled over and I started
yelling at this coyote

554
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:50.370
and anyone has found that hey,
if they do something,

555
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.030
then I started whistling at them,
you know,
not in like a sexual way.

556
00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.030
I'm not a creep.
I was whistling and I'm like,
it was domesticated.

557
00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.000
I just want to see if I could fuck them up,
you know,

558
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.460
just can we
can we believe

559
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.620
and think was looking at me like,
dude,
are you serious?
And I was like,
no,

560
00:35:10.621 --> 00:35:13.600
not really.
I just want to see what you would do.
You fucking cunt.

561
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.900
And I drove home and I had some Salami and some horseradish cheddar cheese.

562
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.760
And uh,
oh,
you know,
when I got the other day,
I got this new Sam Adams.

563
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:30.810
Um,
I really am a Douche bag this week and wearing pajamas.

564
00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:32.340
I'm drinking Sam Adams.

565
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.730
And if I have a story that involves me having a sandwich with an olive in it,

566
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.070
you should really just unsubscribe to my podcast at this point.

567
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.990
Or maybe any story when I'm standing here in a blazer with a pipe.
Um,

568
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.700
yeah,
I bought this new Sam Adams Beer,
like uh,

569
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.620
you know they had like the seasonal ones.

570
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.630
What is it that the blackberry something beer.
I know it sounds gross,
right?

571
00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:02.550
That's what I was thinking.
I'm like,
that sounds gross.
I'm like,
but a Sam Adams,

572
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:04.110
somehow they make this shit tastes good.

573
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:06.720
That Sherry Week Cherry wheat was something that bears,

574
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:10.410
I drank and I thought it was the most delicious beer I ever had.

575
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:15.590
And by the third one I felt like I had eaten the whole bag of candy and I was

576
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:19.520
like,
I need to stop.
But I still get those.
I like the somewhere else.

577
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.420
I figured fuck it.
You know what it was?

578
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:26.421
I had just seen a Sam Adams commercial and I fucking challenge you to not want

579
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:29.760
to go drink 12 beers after seeing a Sam Adams commercial.

580
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.930
You ever see those commercials?

581
00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.750
And the guy sticks his fucking face and those hops

582
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.900
grabs two big handfuls.
They show how many extra hops they put in,

583
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.110
which I don't even know what that does.
Evidently it makes it more tasty.

584
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:48.240
And then when they put it in dead fucking dead beer,
glass shape,

585
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:52.740
shape,
like a voluptuous woman,
you know,
and it just looks that perfect color.

586
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.910
That's what was in my head.
And I was at the grocery store,
I was like,
Oh man,

587
00:36:56.911 --> 00:37:00.690
they got a new flavor and that guy's face and the hops that's very sexual,

588
00:37:00.691 --> 00:37:04.200
like he's got to use buried his face and some chick's pussy.
And then the end,

589
00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:07.260
they show her all filled up and fulfilled,
you know,

590
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.060
all filled up and fulfill.
There's a sentence for you.
So anyway,
Black Berry,

591
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.980
sweeter the bass,
I'm led darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice they got me,

592
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.080
they all went sex on me and I fucking bought it.

593
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.500
And I would tell you that was the worst goddamn tasting beer I've ever had my

594
00:37:22.501 --> 00:37:26.490
fucking life.
Okay.
You know,
I'm a big fan of these smaller brewers,

595
00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:30.480
even though they're huge.
Sam Adams is huge now,
but I'll tell you the Sammy,

596
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:33.990
he missed the mark on that one cause that tasted like a,

597
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.370
I don't know where it tasted like

598
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.110
it tasted like Sam Adams armpit.
Okay.
That's,

599
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.820
that didn't even make sense under said this,

600
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.590
avoid the Sam Adams blackberry.
Whatever the fuck it's called.

601
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.200
It's like,
where the fuck was I thinking blackberry.

602
00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.980
You don't what the advertisement should that for?
That shit should be,

603
00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:59.280
it should be.
It's not a wine cooler.
It's not a beer.

604
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.680
Or maybe they get a bad cop buddy movie.
You know,
he's a bear.

605
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.450
He's a wine cooler and together they taste like ask what is the,

606
00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:14.070
I'm actually my refrigerator right now.
The blackberry.
Ah,

607
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:19.260
Jesus.
I can't pronounce it with beer.
W.
I.
T.
V.
I.
E.
R.

608
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.300
Is it from a fancy German way of spelling?
Uh,

609
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.070
whatever fucking word that's supposed to be.
That's not a word.

610
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.000
There's no space between it.
I didn't want the fuck that is

611
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.650
and yeah,
I feel like I'm in Woodstock right now.

612
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:39.490
You ever see that thing where they're like,
stay away from the red tabs,
man.

613
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.420
I'm telling you,
stay away from the Black Berry,

614
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:48.460
Sam Adams with bear.
All right?
It's not a good fucking scene.

615
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.990
It's not a good fucking scene.
And yes,
Jesus Christ.
What,
you know,
that's it.

616
00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:57.580
I'm done with that.
I'm,
anytime there's any sort of fruit in a beer,

617
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:02.530
you gotta be done.
Although I do like what does that bear?

618
00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:06.130
They put the slice of orange and the,
uh,

619
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.250
I'm just really going to just say one douche bag.

620
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:13.060
Think about my personality after another on this podcast.
This is what it is,

621
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.390
you know,
and for some reason,

622
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:20.040
one of you finds me to be your hero and you,
uh,

623
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.640
took out the CD cover and taped it on the ceiling above your bed.

624
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.010
And I just realized that all of a post or myself,
what kind of,

625
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:34.630
what kind of fucking entertainer or am I that I don't have that poster,

626
00:39:34.631 --> 00:39:37.720
you know what I mean?
When I'm standing under the tree,
you know,

627
00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:42.160
both hands up on the tree branch above me with the little seashell necklace and

628
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:43.710
my shirt opened down to my navel.

629
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.420
Then little Shaun Cassidy poster a,
that's when you know you made it.

630
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.520
That's when you know you made it.
When you're,

631
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.210
when you're posing for that picture and nobody around you is telling you it's a

632
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:58.540
bad idea,
that's when you know you made it.
That's when you know,

633
00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:01.060
because you are making so much fucking money.

634
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.420
People are afraid to tell you that maybe you shouldn't be sitting on a tire

635
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:09.520
swing with one leg in the air,
you know,

636
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.950
for the poster of your upcoming tour.
Um,
okay.

637
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.840
That was a long way to go to do a Shaun Cassidy reference.
Um,
anyways,

638
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:22.570
this is the Monday morning podcast and uh,

639
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:27.870
if you are new to my page of my website or on my myspace page,

640
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.480
um,
welcome.

641
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.600
I did one of these every single Monday and people send me a list of questions of

642
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:41.800
collections,
not questions,
questions,
because it is the internet.
Um,

643
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:47.340
they send me lists of questions and I tried to answer them to the best of my

644
00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:51.940
ability.
It's fucking pajamas a killing me.

645
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.230
I'm fucking,
I with my brain.
I don't know.
I gotta let my brain this week,

646
00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.300
Clinton,
my fucking brain,
what am I freak?

647
00:40:59.301 --> 00:41:01.330
I'm freaking out about something right now and I can't even figure it out.

648
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:04.540
What the fuck it is.
Um,
but anyways,

649
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:09.100
I do this podcast every single week.
Yeah.
They send me questions,
questions,

650
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.550
and they,
uh,
send me their list of underrated overrated things.
They,
uh,

651
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.700
give me movie reviews.
They asked me for advice.

652
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:18.640
They tell me to go fuck myself every once in a while.

653
00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:22.780
Someone such a constantly become douche bag of the week and a,

654
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:26.950
and lately people have been sending me stories about revenge.
Um,

655
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.660
which I find fascinating because that's one of the few evils that I've,

656
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.790
uh,
I've actually resisted.

657
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.350
I have not partaked in,
um,
Oh,

658
00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:43.220
before I get too deep into this podcast.
And why let you guys know that my,
uh,

659
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:47.330
my standup special,
why do I do this?
Evidently is on demand.

660
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:52.310
So,
uh,
if you want to have a little party,
you know,

661
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.980
get out your little fucking not tea cups and a table that's way too big for you

662
00:41:57.981 --> 00:42:00.380
to be sitting at because that's what you do.
At a tea party.
Don't yet.

663
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.980
Does anybody over the age of five have a fucking tea party?

664
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:09.080
Do they do that over in England or do they just have fucking tea and just sit

665
00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:13.520
there and stare out of the clouds?
Um,
all right,

666
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:16.070
let's get on with the broadcast.
Okay.
That was my opening.

667
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:20.840
Just burst of energy trying to make this fucking thing funny because,
uh,

668
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.250
I only got five hours sleep last night.
Oh,
poor fucking baby.

669
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:27.830
You only got five hours sleep and now what are you gonna do with the lay around

670
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:32.390
the next day,
the rest of the day,
and you fucking pajamas.
You know what about me,

671
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:32.930
Eh,

672
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.840
the fucking work in man Trican boilermakers till six in the morning.

673
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:42.770
Now I'm operating heavy machinery.
Go Fuck Yourself.

674
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.170
It's not my fault.
Okay.
Fuck you.

675
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:48.530
You're doing heavy machinery that makes you make when like fucking 30 bucks an

676
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:53.210
hour,
30 bucks an hour to take that on mountain.
All right.

677
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.080
That made no sense.
What's so fucking ever,
um,

678
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.350
I just have a bunch of random notes here.

679
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:05.360
Notes that I've made over the past week.
Here's an idea.
I had in an airport,

680
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.910
nothing suffers like the luggage of fat people.

681
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:13.100
And I don't know how I came up with that.
I know what it was.

682
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:17.750
I just saw this woman dragging her wheelie sideways or was it a guy?

683
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:21.620
I can't remember.
Once you get to that size,

684
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:25.280
is it really matter if you think about that?
It's become so big.

685
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:29.870
You just come asexual.
This is my,
uh,
late night DJ voice sort of,

686
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.440
uh,
trying to convince you with some things.
Um,
all right.
And that was creepy.

687
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.230
I'm sorry.
All right.
What do you want to talk about?
Creepy.

688
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:41.090
Let's talk about how Obama,
President Obama,
oh,
uh,

689
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.120
Barack Obama was on the tonight show this week.

690
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.850
Did that disturb anyone as a fucking American?
Is he in dude,

691
00:43:49.851 --> 00:43:52.010
where's my car part too?
You know,

692
00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:55.190
what the fuck are you doing on the tonight show?
I got a big army,

693
00:43:55.191 --> 00:43:59.180
my girlfriend about that and I said,
oh,
it's good.

694
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.430
It's a great way to reach people.

695
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:07.010
It's like when you have a fucking friends conference,
right.

696
00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:10.160
I got to do is wheel out that podium.
The whole world sits around and watches it.

697
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.620
I couldn't,
I couldn't,
I couldn't sit there and watch him.
You know what I mean?

698
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.170
It's like,
dude,
[inaudible] like near the red phone.

699
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:21.110
What if the red phone rings and you're on there,
you know,

700
00:44:21.111 --> 00:44:23.570
picking your fucking march madness brackets.

701
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:30.070
It's unreal how the presidency of has just gone downhill just over the last

702
00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:31.530
fucking 10 years.

703
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:35.460
Like right around 10 years ago was when Bill Clinton got impeached because of

704
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:39.390
some fucking Skank,
you know,

705
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.060
every president.
Can you too cute?

706
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:48.110
Can you even begin to understand not only the amount of world leaders that have

707
00:44:49.861 --> 00:44:53.220
been in the Oval Office,
but the amount of fucking skanks

708
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.770
that have been in there that does the original playboy mansion.
All right,

709
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.770
guys have been in there getting blown

710
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:04.770
for centuries.

711
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.470
Women love power guys loved blow jobs.
Okay,

712
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.910
and you and you marry the two.

713
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.110
You get the fucking Oval Office that is ground zero for that shit.

714
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.020
And the guy got fucking impeached for it.
It's right there.

715
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:20.700
I thought that knocked down the presidency,

716
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:25.730
that the president with fucking secret service at his fingertips can't get a

717
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:29.740
fucking blow job.
Right?
He gets busted and,

718
00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.090
and then you had a,
what's his face?
Uh,
uh,

719
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:37.260
Georgie [inaudible] whose dad evidently didn't teach them how to give a speech.

720
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.850
So we had to look at that fucking retard for the last eight years,

721
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.470
given a speech where he sounds like somebody given a book report who didn't read

722
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:49.170
the book.
You know what I mean?
Kind of.
Secondly in Ariana,

723
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:54.090
he had that shit and now we got this fuck head going on the tonight show.

724
00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.240
You know,
like he's Ashton Kutcher.
I don't know.

725
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:04.750
I don't like it.
This is three,
three presidents in a row where I,

726
00:46:04.751 --> 00:46:07.290
I don't like what they're doing.
You wear the blue suit,

727
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.360
you wear the fucking tie and uh,
you,
you should have an air about you that you,

728
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.900
and he just shouldn't be on the tonight show.
You know what I mean?

729
00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:21.870
And then this night show pad is Ashton Kutcher it,

730
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.050
President Obama.
You know what?
I didn't even watch it.

731
00:46:25.051 --> 00:46:28.470
I'm like literally criticizing.
I did something I didn't even watch.
You know,

732
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.350
I just couldn't sit there and watch that showing.
Yes,

733
00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.640
he gets dragged to presidents are limos and I just didn't have the Hemi

734
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.840
[inaudible] here.
We doing donuts.
We do it very notes.

735
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:46.280
Um,
I dunno.
All right,
let's,
let's get on with the fuck.
I'm really,

736
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.310
really in an extra fucking shit mood right now.
You know,

737
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:52.310
it all started last night when I yelled at that coyote,
you know,

738
00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.880
that's what I did.
I turned my back on nature and I,

739
00:46:55.881 --> 00:47:00.480
she kind of freaked me out cause it was just a couple of blocks down my,
uh,

740
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.310
my street.
You know what I mean?
It's like kill of a sudden.

741
00:47:03.311 --> 00:47:07.830
It's like a fucking will Smith movie playing out at three in the morning.
And uh,

742
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:09.950
I was kind of wondering like,
where the fuck that thing came from?

743
00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.970
I know the Hollywood hills,
they're kind of off there in the distance,
but uh,

744
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.500
you know,
oh,
what a coyote seat roadrunners.
Huh?

745
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:23.810
Who watches cartoons?
I do,
but they never catch them.

746
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.540
What does that even fucking true?

747
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.180
You know what I mean?
Roll hunters.
Can Fly.
Right.
They just choose not to.

748
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:37.750
They'd read around that.
Read a run,
be the fucking martyr.

749
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.780
Make all the other birds feel guilty for taking the easy way out.
All right,

750
00:47:41.781 --> 00:47:45.190
let's get on with the questions here because this podcast is in a cul de sac

751
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:46.990
right now.
I have driven down the street,

752
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.890
it says not a throughway and I continued down the fucking street and now I'm

753
00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:54.460
just driving around in a fucking circle.
Okay.
Uh,
Bill,

754
00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.950
I've been listening to your podcast since I watched you perform and because it's

755
00:48:01.241 --> 00:48:05.050
nice to hear someone use the word cunt every five minutes.
You know,

756
00:48:05.051 --> 00:48:06.610
a lot of people who have been giving me shit about that,

757
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.520
say I used the word cut too much and that they're starting to use it in everyday

758
00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:12.790
life and their,
uh,
you know,

759
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:18.310
they're dropping it in weird times.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to try to take,

760
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:23.080
I'm going to try not to use the word console much.
Alright.
ECON.
Hey,

761
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:25.060
he did a cunt joke.
All right.

762
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.250
In addition is the rest of the rest of the question.
But,
um,

763
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.280
how do you feel about non Irish,

764
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.890
the way Non Irish people celebrate Saint Patrick's Day?
Quite frankly,

765
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.660
it pisses me off.
It's a day to celebrate the patron saint of Ireland,

766
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.020
not to get drunk.
I'm from Cleveland,

767
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:48.880
Ohio and here we have a big parade downtown.
It's so annoying seeing the drunks,

768
00:48:48.881 --> 00:48:49.900
filling the streets.

769
00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.760
People stereotype us as if we're the only culture that has a drink.

770
00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:55.594
Once in a while.

771
00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:00.070
I'm Irish American and I'm probably the only woman of Irish descent who has

772
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:02.530
never been drunk.
Really.

773
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:10.270
My family and I usually have a traditional meal of boiled potatoes,
carrots,

774
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:15.250
cabbage,
corn,
beef and Irish Soda Bread.
Now let me tell you something.

775
00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:17.740
If ever there was a fucking reason to get drunk,

776
00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.190
it's the kill,
the taste,
boiled potatoes,
carrots,

777
00:49:24.191 --> 00:49:25.480
cabbage,
corn,
beef,

778
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:30.481
and you can just taste the hot water on the fucking over.

779
00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:33.760
Boiled vegetables on.

780
00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.040
Every nutrient is just taken out of them.

781
00:49:36.041 --> 00:49:41.041
You wonder why as Irish people have such pasty fucking skin and no pigment of

782
00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:44.010
the boil on the fucking nutrition out of the,
out of the,

783
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.380
out of the vegetables anyways.
Personally,
she says,

784
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.480
I think traditional Irish food sucks.

785
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:53.440
And it's mostly because they didn't cultivate much except for potatoes and

786
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:57.700
cabbage.
We ever think maybe they were too fucking drunk to get a cookbook,

787
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.080
you know?
But I do like Irish Soda Bread.

788
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.860
I remember you saying you don't go out drinking.
I don't,

789
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:09.040
I don't think I ever said that.
Is that a Typo?
Um,
but you,

790
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:13.450
but do you ever do anything and do you like Irish foods?

791
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.281
Um,
I to admit,

792
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:19.570
I really do like a corned beef sandwich and I really do like potatoes.

793
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.340
I do not like boiled potatoes.

794
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:25.000
Boiled potatoes are disgusting and you need at least half a stick of butter,

795
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.300
salt and pepper to just kill the taste of what you did to it.

796
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:35.370
You know what I mean?
I'm trying to think of anything that you should,
boy,

797
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:40.260
other than drinking water during a fucking catastrophe,
you know,

798
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:45.200
what do you boil rice?
All right.
And then would you boil,

799
00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.860
I dunno,
but let me get back to the question.
How do I feel about people,
uh,

800
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.870
who celebrates St Faxing?
I don't go out on Saint Patrick's Day.
That's a,
a,

801
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.000
it's a very bad day to go drinking,
you know,

802
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:59.600
everybody out in their green plastic hats and they'd say,
hey,
they're good.

803
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.890
Iin alligator and a long neck goose.
Yeah,
it's,

804
00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:08.240
it's very,
um,
uh,
it's,
you know,

805
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:10.430
it's like drinking on New Year's Eve,
you know,

806
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.850
and all the dumb concert out with their stupid little Horry outfits.

807
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:18.500
And is this the sound of the noisemakers weren't ear piercing enough?

808
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:23.480
You got them shrieking over them.
It's just a horrible time to go out.
And,

809
00:51:23.481 --> 00:51:25.490
um,
I still have in us to the question,

810
00:51:25.491 --> 00:51:29.690
how do I feel about non Irish people celebrating Saint Patrick's Day?

811
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:35.570
I really could give a shit.
I think it's a statement of,
uh,

812
00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:40.250
I dunno how empty their lives are or how the herd just follows whatever the fuck

813
00:51:40.251 --> 00:51:42.890
they supposed to do.
You know,

814
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.300
there's always like that one traditional guy and he's got to wear the Sculley

815
00:51:47.301 --> 00:51:50.450
cap in the Irish sweater standing over in the corner,

816
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:54.980
cutting into a bar of soap with a knife.
You know that guy.
Um,

817
00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:56.010
yeah I could give a,
I'm a,

818
00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:00.980
I'm German Irish and I could give a shit about a Saint Patrick's day.

819
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.260
I don't know the story of the patron saint and um,

820
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:09.910
yeah,
I don't give a fuck.
I think in the,
in the,

821
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:14.480
when I was in my twenties I used to go out to pubs on Saint Patrick's Day.

822
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.590
Um,

823
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.700
and I used to do it because I would thought I could get laid that night cause I

824
00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:22.880
look so Irish.
And then some girls that are like,
oh my God,

825
00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:26.750
this is what the day is about.
Here's the Leprechaun right here.

826
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.540
Maybe I'll blow him.
That's the only reason why I went out.

827
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.820
I was desperately trying to be interesting.

828
00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.050
But now I just,
I don't go out.

829
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:40.100
I don't go out on new years and I don't go out on Saint Patrick's Day.

830
00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:45.260
I don't go out on flag day and he sorta day Earth Day I stay home.

831
00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.570
Those are,
those are,

832
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:52.370
those are just douche bag days and what you want to do is whatever people are

833
00:52:52.371 --> 00:52:55.430
doing is you,
you do it the next day,

834
00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:01.040
like Valentine's Day.
Everyone brings their broad out to go fucking whatever,

835
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:03.920
right?
He can't get a reservation anywhere.

836
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:07.340
The fucking prices are jacked up through the roof.
This is what you'd do.

837
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:12.170
You'd go out on the 15th that's what you do and you tell you woman that that's

838
00:53:12.171 --> 00:53:15.980
what you're doing because you're going to get a fucking table anywhere you want.

839
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:17.890
You're not going to get raped on the charges.

840
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:22.430
You probably actually be able to go to a better restaurant than you would have

841
00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:25.680
on the night of the 14th and that's a great like,
you know,
you know Bronx tale,

842
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:26.640
the lock,
the door test.

843
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.250
That's a great way to see if you're with the cool girl or not.

844
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:32.910
If she'd let you take her out on the on on the 15th cause it really doesn't make

845
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:35.730
a fucking difference,
does it?
You know,

846
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.800
you're going to get to see if she is an independent thinker or if she's fucking

847
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:45.660
stuck in must see TV,
you know,

848
00:53:45.661 --> 00:53:49.170
and it's going to drag you to the Macy Day fucking Thanksgiving parade one day.

849
00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:53.750
Cause that's what you do.
Everybody else is doing it.

850
00:53:53.751 --> 00:53:58.080
We have to do it,
honey.
It's not that I don't love you.

851
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.630
We're just going to get right there on the price.
You know,

852
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:06.600
you're trying to find a bargain on Valentine's Day.

853
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:11.070
Uh,
I want to be rude bitch.
But you're in the relationship too.

854
00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:14.850
You're not paying for the fucking meal.
How does that work?
Exactly.

855
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:20.400
Exactly.
You know what?
Now I'm not even taking out.
We'll go ahead and cry.

856
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:21.660
Go ahead and cry.
It's not going to work.

857
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:25.950
This is all fucking fake because you know,
I just expose you for being selfish.

858
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.200
I like that.
Now that was great.

859
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.840
You like that and you liked that little little reflected there?
I always,

860
00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:35.370
when the hypothetical arguments.
Okay,
Bill,

861
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.090
how would,
uh,

862
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:40.140
how would I go about getting a personalized autographed DVD set from you?

863
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:44.700
DVD set?
I didn't know where they were releasing them in a set.

864
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.890
Do I have a trilogy of Dvds like the Godfather?
Um,

865
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.640
how would you go about that?
Uh,

866
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:55.290
you'd come out to one of my shows if that's what you would do and you'd buy one,

867
00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.540
and I'd stand there and I'd fucking sign it for you.

868
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.240
And I'd smile like a jackass is,

869
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:04.110
I waited the excruciating eight seconds that it takes for a digital camera to

870
00:55:04.111 --> 00:55:07.690
click before the three flash bulbs go pump

871
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:12.450
some of those disposable cameras,
as bad as they were for the environment,

872
00:55:12.451 --> 00:55:17.400
I imagine.
How great will those things say cheese collect?
And it was over.

873
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:23.100
Now they fucking got those digital cameras.
They're like,
okay,
Lan till today.

874
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.300
And then you sit in there waiting and waiting with that fucking smile plastered

875
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:28.860
on your face.
You know,

876
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:32.640
like that fucking newscasts or it goes to throw it to the other newscaster in

877
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:34.590
the field and then it doesn't go.

878
00:55:34.591 --> 00:55:38.550
And then you just staring at the entire state that you're broadcasting to now

879
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:40.920
off to Mike,
out in Chelmsford.

880
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.360
Okay.
We seem to be having some tactical hook.
I'll pay.

881
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:53.640
That's what it's like getting your picture taken on fucking digital camera.

882
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.460
And then what's even better is when they accidentally hit video and then you're

883
00:55:56.461 --> 00:55:58.080
standing there with a smile on your face.
Like

884
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:03.560
he started talking through your taste is a god,
hold a button down.

885
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.730
You got to haul the dob.

886
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.300
Now many times that's happened to me after my shows and they're like,
oh my God,

887
00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:10.320
I had it on video.

888
00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.720
And those are the times when I wish I didn't sell shit at the end of my shows.

889
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:23.010
You know,
I like meeting people after my shows.
I definitely liked doing that.

890
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:26.350
You know,
sometimes you feel like a fucking idiot,
you know,

891
00:56:26.351 --> 00:56:29.410
especially when people come up to you and like,
you know,
I did.
It gives us Joe,

892
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:34.180
can you just say pesto and then we'll take the picture now?
No,
I can't.

893
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.760
Oh my God,
you're so grumpy.
Shut up.
Take the picture.
Um,
all right.

894
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.280
Anyways.
Uh,
he said,
I didn't want to let me go on with this guy.
He says,

895
00:56:45.281 --> 00:56:49.750
I'm happy to pay for it and I have a downloaded copies paid for to my iPhone,

896
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.280
but I want an autograph one,

897
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.690
so let me know what I need to do to get one where I had to pay for it.
All right?

898
00:56:55.691 --> 00:57:00.310
I'm kind of being a Douche or,
but like,
um,
you know,

899
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.960
people ask me for like autographed photos and Shit.

900
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:08.920
Like I'm Fonzie sometimes and they never,

901
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:13.310
they like expect me to pay the postage and all that type of shit and it's just

902
00:57:13.311 --> 00:57:17.620
like,
I'm not doing that.
Okay.
All right.
I hang out at the end of my shows.

903
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:21.640
I take pictures,
I autograph,
do everything but kiss fucking babies.
All right?

904
00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:23.260
I do this podcast every week.

905
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:26.380
I'm not going to get myself into a situation where I got to go to the post

906
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:31.240
office,
you know,
every fucking,
you know,
every other day.
All right.

907
00:57:31.241 --> 00:57:33.760
With Manila envelopes.
I'm not doing that shit.
You know,

908
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:37.000
trying to think of something to write before assignment.

909
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:41.140
That's the hardest thing about giving an autograph.
Can you make it out to Susie?

910
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.320
And then I always write Susie and then I sign my name and I'm like,

911
00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:48.700
then I try to think what to write and I'm like,
uh,

912
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:52.300
God bless a Susie.

913
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.880
What's going on?
Bill Burr?

914
00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:03.760
Ah,
Shit.
All right.
Who complains about signing autographs?
You know what I do.

915
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:09.280
I do.
Um,
okay.
Uh,
okay,
let's go.
Let's get on with this.

916
00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:12.520
I'm really sounded like a fucking window.
I get off complainant.

917
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.331
I liked the way I acted.

918
00:58:13.331 --> 00:58:16.390
Like I would see someone asked me for a photograph every other day.

919
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.450
I was going to say every 20 minutes and I'm like,
they'll never believe that.

920
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:21.610
I'll say every other day.
That's not even true.

921
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.640
It's usually like once a month and it's usually somebody with a fatal disease

922
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.450
and I still don't send it to them cause that's the kind of guy I am.
Alright.

923
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:33.280
Also bill,
let me move on here.

924
00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.740
You should really promote the protests.
Uh,
okay bill,
you should also,

925
00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:41.890
you should really promote the podcast for download on iTunes.

926
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:44.350
That shit is so easy that once you do it,

927
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:47.430
you have the podcasts on your iPhone and you can listen to it in the car

928
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.640
anywhere other than in front of a computer.
Well,
there you go.
Everybody,

929
00:58:51.641 --> 00:58:56.440
you can download it on iTunes.
Thank you sir.
He just hyped it for me.

930
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:57.160
All right.

931
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.450
Last week I had a big question about the differences between hotels and motels

932
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:07.210
and uh,
well first of all before we get into this shit,
um,
how about those Bruins?

933
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:11.580
Huh?
Beating the New Jersey devils.
I got any New Jersey Devil fans out,
dad,

934
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:16.060
you like that little four to one victory.
I'm just fucking with you.

935
00:59:16.061 --> 00:59:19.810
You guys got a great team and if you're not watching hockey right now,

936
00:59:19.811 --> 00:59:24.811
I really feel bad for you all you guys watching March madness and uh,

937
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:28.490
you know,
waiting for that,
that awful song at the end of the tournament,

938
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:32.980
when they show the great moments,
I had a tree,

939
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:38.590
they usually pick the Lakeland was syrupy song as they show all the dunks in

940
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:42.050
slow motion and the people being excited and then crying.

941
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.700
What is this song that they sing to night?
How I need you.

942
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.930
Oh,
the dark

943
00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:01.130
telling you right now.
Play off.
Hockey's coming the flyers of playing great.

944
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.500
The rangers lost yesterday,
but they're coming on.

945
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:05.330
The capital's a fucking ridiculous.

946
01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:10.610
The goddamn Devil's got an insane team as always.
I really hate,

947
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:15.600
I really hate the devil.
I just hate their,
uh,
I,

948
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:19.370
I hate the country style of hockey that they played throughout the 90s with the

949
01:00:19.371 --> 01:00:23.540
left wing Loc and the trap defense.
I swear to God,
not disrespecting,

950
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.560
you know Marty Bro over there in the big record that he got,
but you know,

951
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.780
it's a little padded.

952
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:34.790
It's a little fucking pad it with the fucking trap defense.
I mean,

953
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:37.070
he spent half his career have to save the,

954
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:41.540
made with skating behind his next stop in the puck because they just would dump

955
01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:45.470
it in because they'd clog up the neutral zone and you know what I mean?

956
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.400
And that was also during the clutch and grab era.
Jesus Christ,
I couldn't,

957
01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:54.290
I go to squeezed out a couple of shout outs.
All right,
that's bullshit.
I just,

958
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.830
I just hated that period of hockey.
And when I think about that period of hockey,

959
01:00:57.831 --> 01:01:01.490
I think about the New Jersey devils and I don't still to this day,

960
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:05.150
I don't understand why the NHL just didn't say that's an illegal defense,

961
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.433
you know what I mean?

962
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:11.390
It's like when will Chamberlain was fucking dunking on everybody.
You know,

963
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:13.800
they came up with rules to,

964
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:18.860
to keep it competitive because it's a fucking business.
You know,

965
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.390
the three second rule,

966
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:24.350
you can't have some guy just standing in the fucking paint who's nine feet tall.

967
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:29.120
Goaltending they came up with that shit and they came up with the legal
defenses.

968
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.180
I still don't know why they allow that defense.

969
01:01:32.181 --> 01:01:34.970
It's the worst fuck they had to get rid of the red line because of that shit.

970
01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.560
I don't know.
But I was watching yesterday and they don't play it anymore,

971
01:01:39.561 --> 01:01:41.060
so I really enjoyed it.
But as usual,

972
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:44.360
they just got great fucking players and they play smart fucking hockey.

973
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:48.350
And uh,
I dunno,
I dunno.

974
01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:51.650
It's going to be a tough fucking road and a,
for those of you who are,

975
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:53.570
who kind of want to know.
This is a question I have for you.

976
01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:56.750
Who the fuck are these people who are trying to get the fighting out of hockey?

977
01:01:56.810 --> 01:02:01.370
I don't understand them.
You know,
watch a different sport.
Hockey is not for you.

978
01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.800
All right?
And if it's somebody in hockey stopped doing it,

979
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.320
don't get rid of fighting and hockey.
All right,

980
01:02:09.321 --> 01:02:12.770
and think that you're going to be as popular as baseball,
basketball or football.

981
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.680
You're not all right.
You're a rogue fucking sport.

982
01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.040
You are really in hard about hockey.
If you never,

983
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:23.220
if you didn't grow up playing it are in like a hockey family or in a hockey
town,

984
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.480
it's duck the hardest fucking game to watch on TV.

985
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.750
I was kind of noticing that yesterday.

986
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:34.320
Like you literally have to be not only watching what's on the screen,

987
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.490
but what is like literally 20 feet to the left of your screen.

988
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:40.740
You know what I mean?
You got to,

989
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.280
you got to figure out like a guests when they're like,
you can have a while.

990
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:45.270
You watch it long enough,

991
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.680
you know what's going on to the left or to the right of the play.

992
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:54.180
That is literally off the TV screen.
He just called the change in lines.

993
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.750
Like you just know shit like that.

994
01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.360
I can't see the puck.
Well fucking watch bowling.
You're blind bastard.

995
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:06.090
All right.
It was a question I had last week.
Someone I asked,

996
01:03:06.091 --> 01:03:08.610
what's the difference between a hotel in a motel?
You know what I mean?

997
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:10.980
And I thought it was basically,
you know,

998
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.270
if your door opens up out to the parking lot,
that is a fucking motel.

999
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.010
It's a serial killer.

1000
01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:21.000
Doesn't have to kill somebody at a front desk and get an an elevator or at least

1001
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.330
walk a hundred yards of carpet before he kills you.

1002
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.470
That is a hotel now that is a motel.
I'm sorry if he has to do that shit.

1003
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.170
That is a hotel.
And evidently I am right.

1004
01:03:31.171 --> 01:03:33.990
Because one person said that I was,

1005
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.410
and that's the amount of research that I do with everything in my life.
Well,

1006
01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:41.290
if you drive up to your room,
uh,
you are at a motel and use it as a,

1007
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:45.120
and you deserve to hear the people fucking next to you.
Oh wait,

1008
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.030
I read that wrong because I have dyslexia.
Let me start over again.

1009
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.690
Take a deep breath focus.
You can do this bill.

1010
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.730
If you drive up to your room,

1011
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:59.330
you are at a motel and you deserve to hear the fucking people next to you talk

1012
01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:04.920
about their free fucking Hbo.
Okay,
that was really funny and I butchered it.

1013
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.780
Um,
anyways,
he goes a,

1014
01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:13.020
that shit sucks also.
You're killing me.
You're fucking killing me.

1015
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:16.710
You spend $89 on a cheap motel.
Are you fucking nuts?

1016
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.860
I always hear about this internet stuff and I never do it.

1017
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:24.600
And he writes in capital letters.
Then he goes back to regular typing.

1018
01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:27.000
Listen to me,
go to Priceline.

1019
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:31.470
Next time you're traveling and look up a hotel and pick the highest star rating

1020
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:36.471
and do not bid any more than 89 bucks and you'll get the best hotel in the city

1021
01:04:36.931 --> 01:04:37.860
for that price.

1022
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.380
I would tell you to go down to 59 or 69 bucks,

1023
01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:46.710
but just stick with 89 bucks.
Please just try it once.

1024
01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:50.700
I traveled the road for 14 years and I kicked myself in the ass when I realized

1025
01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:51.870
what I'd been missing out on.

1026
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.160
Thanks for the free podcast to the highlight of my Monday mornings.

1027
01:04:56.161 --> 01:05:00.960
Well thanks for the fucking Info.
That's that William Shatner.
Shit.

1028
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.410
I never even,
I don't even pay attention to commercials.

1029
01:05:04.411 --> 01:05:08.610
I just look at the fucking,
the glitzy lights.
I'm like,
Oh wow,
look,
I will shit.

1030
01:05:08.611 --> 01:05:10.470
And William Shatner,
you know,
he's keeping it going.

1031
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:15.810
Did Star Trek 40 fucking years ago and he's still working,
you know.

1032
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:21.910
Um,
and he has a hell of it to pick.
All right,
Asheville,
here we go.

1033
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.110
Here's the Asheville,
a section of the podcast that I just started there.

1034
01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:29.590
I was all right,
ask bill.
Bill,
I need your advice.

1035
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:34.180
I had something very horrible happened to me and Oh man,
this is brutal.

1036
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:39.490
Settle into your fucking your staples office chair for this one.

1037
01:05:39.491 --> 01:05:42.820
People.
This is,
this is a tough situation.
All right.

1038
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.470
And I dunno if I got the uh,
life experience to get you out of this one.

1039
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.330
Um,
Asbell okay,
bill,
I need your advice.
I had something very,

1040
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.170
very horrible happened to me and it's nobody's fault but mine.

1041
01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.570
Nobody's fault but mine,
Ben in and Nnn,
sorry,
let's up.
All right.
I have this,

1042
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.220
I have this friend
who don't get me wrong is a good friend,

1043
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:11.280
but is that one type of friend who's really fucking annoying but wanting to hang

1044
01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:13.870
out 24,
seven.

1045
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:19.840
Just recently I got a new girlfriend and I've been spending all my time with

1046
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:23.080
her.
My friend then became jealous,

1047
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.860
becoming more and more knowing by making me feel bad for being with my girl.

1048
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:29.650
Anyway,
long story short to vent,

1049
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:34.860
I wrote an email to my girl just trashing my friend up and down the fucking road

1050
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:39.970
for being the moron.
Wait a minute.

1051
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.520
Could you use a smaller type set?
You know,

1052
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:47.380
I suck at reading a bulk IC,
trashing my friend up and down,

1053
01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:50.380
but being the moron that I am,
and here we go,

1054
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:54.580
people instead of just sending it,
emailing it to her,

1055
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.220
I checked this,
send all options,

1056
01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:00.970
sending this horrendous email to everyone on my email list.

1057
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:06.490
Oops.
My email list doesn't really have too many people on it,

1058
01:07:06.491 --> 01:07:11.210
but it does have the friend I was trashing.
Of course,
it just made,

1059
01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.500
it just made me realize that you shouldn't say things behind someone's back if

1060
01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:15.790
he can't say it to their face.

1061
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:19.420
So I'm nominating myself for Douche bag of the week.
Lol.

1062
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:23.980
What would be your advice?
Send an apology email or just ignore them.

1063
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:30.490
Ah,
that's the worst.
That's the worst.

1064
01:07:30.491 --> 01:07:34.390
Because you know what sucks about that is
you,

1065
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:39.870
you're 100% in the right that this guy is a douche bag,

1066
01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:43.930
but now you became the Douche bag because,
uh,

1067
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:46.810
and you know what's funny is if he had a girlfriend,

1068
01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.400
he would be doing the same thing.
He just wouldn't have been a

1069
01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:58.000
dumb enough to fucking send,
hit send to everyone.

1070
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:02.320
Uh,
I dunno,
what should you do?
Should you send an apology email?

1071
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:06.430
No.
First of all,
stop writing things down on paper.

1072
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:10.990
That's number one.
Don't ever do that.
And number two,
learn how to spell apology.

1073
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:11.853
There's no e

1074
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:19.760
I wouldn't just ignore him.
You got to take it like a man.

1075
01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:23.690
He just got to walk up to him and just be like,
yeah,
you know,
I wrote it.

1076
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:28.750
And you know what I meant that you've been a con and a and that's it.

1077
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.750
So you want to punch me in the face knowing that I'm going to defend myself and

1078
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:36.500
punch you too.
So,
you know,
that's kind of where we're at.
I know which shocks,

1079
01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:40.000
I dunno.
You know what I think,
uh,

1080
01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:45.140
I'm getting uncomfortable thinking about the situation you put yourself in.

1081
01:08:45.141 --> 01:08:49.330
I really don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to do with that one.
Uh,

1082
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.700
you got caught and you fucking,
you kind of turn yourself in.

1083
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.000
You should be on America's dumbest shit.
Talkers,

1084
01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:00.890
yellows,
you know,
you know that show,
right?
Americans,
dumbest criminals.

1085
01:09:00.891 --> 01:09:03.710
And the guys put whip cream on their face and they stand in line at the bank and

1086
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:06.650
it melts off their face and by the time they get up,
this is what this guy,

1087
01:09:06.651 --> 01:09:09.300
he did the email equivalent of that.
I don't know what you got to do.

1088
01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.930
I would just,
I have the laugh.
I have no idea.
You know what?

1089
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.850
I got no advice on this one.
I got,
I got,
I got to smell this to listeners.

1090
01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:23.480
All right.
I got to go to way.
Uh,
what did they say that you got to,
I got a phone,

1091
01:09:23.481 --> 01:09:24.170
a friend here.

1092
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:28.780
If anybody has any advices what to what the fuck this guy's supposed to do?
Um,

1093
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:32.430
I'll read it next week because I don't know what to do.
You've,
you've uh,

1094
01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.070
it's checkmate.
Checkmate.
Uh,
I don't know what to do.

1095
01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.900
Dump your girlfriend,
change your name and moved to Alaska.
Um,

1096
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:45.650
either that or he had just,
uh,
I think he just got to take it.

1097
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:50.810
I think he just got to take Eric.
So when did you learn no more fucking emails.

1098
01:09:50.811 --> 01:09:53.540
Right.
And you've got to watch out too,

1099
01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:55.310
cause you eventually you fucking girlfriends.
And even,

1100
01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:56.660
even when she's in a good mood,

1101
01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:00.080
she's still going to tell half the fucking story to uh,

1102
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:06.470
to one of her close friends.
You know what I mean?
I Dunno why they just stay.

1103
01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.610
They really,
um,
I don't really think women know bad at keeping it.

1104
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.820
He didn't guys are overrated,
but their ability to keep a secret.

1105
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.650
I'm going to keep it a secret because I forget shit
cause I'm,

1106
01:10:18.651 --> 01:10:20.810
I have any sort of code.
I just,
you know,

1107
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.230
I have really bad memory and after like three days,
I can't remember.

1108
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:26.780
Like you could literally be like,
Bill,

1109
01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:31.760
anyone don't say anything but I fucked so and so's wife.
I feel like shit,

1110
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.900
I can't believe it.
I have so much guilt.
I just had to tell somebody,

1111
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:40.090
please don't tell anybody.
And I'd be like,
yeah,
okay.
Yeah Dude,
no problem.

1112
01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.430
The problem.
And literally,
I'm not saying two,
three days later,
but

1113
01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.340
by a year and a half,
if I went out to dinner with all the people involved,

1114
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:54.950
maybe sometime around dessert,
I would be like,
oh,
wait a minute.

1115
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.430
Wait a minute.
He fucked that guy is who I am.
That's right.

1116
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.130
That's right.
So it's not like I can keep a secret.
I just,

1117
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:06.350
I can't fucking remember.
Yeah,
though.
We got it.
We got it.

1118
01:11:06.351 --> 01:11:08.840
And then we understood what the example,
you don't need to go back into it.

1119
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.370
Why don't you wrap up the fucking podcast.
All right.

1120
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:15.030
You're 40 fucking minutes in.
I'll
relax.

1121
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.780
It's going to be a long podcast,
but I don't get going here.
Um,
all right,

1122
01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:20.850
let's get on of revenge stories.
Okay.

1123
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:26.250
This is a question I have because every revenge story seems to be from guys.

1124
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.470
None of them seem to be from females.

1125
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:33.390
So finally a woman chimed in with some sort of revenge,

1126
01:11:33.391 --> 01:11:36.750
but it wasn't really revenge.
Um,

1127
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:41.130
or maybe it was revenge and she was just doing the typical thing that women do

1128
01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:45.030
when they tell stories as they never get to the fucking point.
No kidding.
Oh,

1129
01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:48.810
Jesus.
I'm crabby today.
All right.
Here is one from a hormone bill.

1130
01:11:48.811 --> 01:11:51.720
I usually don't take serious advantage on someone,
but I do take,

1131
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:55.800
I take so much pleasure in other persons fuck ups and misery.

1132
01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.400
I always take comfort finding out that someone I hate has such a miserable life.

1133
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:05.560
Here's a story about my egg head Douche ex boyfriend.
All right.

1134
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:09.450
I already liked the sound of this.
All right.
To start to start the story,

1135
01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:14.010
I will admit that I was a cunt who ran rarely gave him any sexual,

1136
01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:18.390
anything sexual for two years.
Jesus Christ.

1137
01:12:18.391 --> 01:12:22.980
That's one of those relationships that died the final two years and no one,

1138
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.410
no one just had the nerve to be like,
hey,

1139
01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:29.760
so why don't we both just fuck off anyways.
Uh,
she goes at least,
uh,

1140
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:31.530
he put up with,
with that shit.

1141
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.860
Any other guy would probably want to do stuff or get sick of it and dump my ass

1142
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:38.123
anyway.

1143
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:43.140
He always played a PC games such as world of Warcraft.

1144
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:48.560
He got so fucking engrossed in that game and paying money every month to renew a

1145
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:51.240
subscription.
What a dumb ass.
However,

1146
01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:55.770
plays can talk to other players in their guild or on their side of the,

1147
01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:58.380
of the game.
After I broke up with them,

1148
01:12:58.381 --> 01:13:02.010
I found out that he was talking to some chick behind my back for a year.

1149
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.420
The story gets better.
Um,
this is,
uh,

1150
01:13:06.421 --> 01:13:10.740
this is where my revenge happens.
I don't have to do shit to ruin his life.

1151
01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:14.610
I didn't have to do shit to ruin his life.
Okay?
So after I'd dump his ass,

1152
01:13:14.611 --> 01:13:18.390
he continues talking to the [inaudible] from the game.

1153
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:22.260
He thinks he's in love with her parentheses,
retard.

1154
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:25.890
So he goes to Canada to be with her where she lives.

1155
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:29.490
I guess he thought she was going to be the one and he proposed.

1156
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:34.620
But a month later he gets deported back to America and like a dumb ass.

1157
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.750
He lets her keep the $3,000 ringer and her finger after a short period of time.

1158
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.630
He tried to go back but he gets deported again.

1159
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:47.940
So he's a college dropout who lives at home with his mommy and he's out three

1160
01:13:47.941 --> 01:13:52.260
grand in addition,
while after he starts dating.

1161
01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.460
Oh,
in addition a while after he starts dating this Jewish bitch,

1162
01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.200
they were dating for about a year and a half,
one and a half years.

1163
01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:05.160
Then she dumps him because she decides it doesn't,

1164
01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.230
it's not going to work out cause he's Catholic.

1165
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:13.270
And the icing on the cake is that all I have to do to make them feel even more

1166
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:16.990
pathetic is let them find out.
I Bang my boyfriend

1167
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.140
and everything he does usually comes back to me because he keeps in contact with

1168
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:25.480
one of my good friends.
Anyway.

1169
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:30.760
Anyone who was on my bad side who has fucked with me has always had something

1170
01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:32.410
come back to bite them in the ass.

1171
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:36.670
I take great pleasure in that Jesus Christ.

1172
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.940
Wow.
That is a fucking,
yeah.
Hell hath no fury.

1173
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.290
I love how you dumped him and you think he's a loser and you're still getting

1174
01:14:47.291 --> 01:14:50.080
enjoyment that he has this horrific life.

1175
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:56.350
That's scary,
man.
You know,
I usually expect that sort of evilness out of guys,

1176
01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.310
you know,
and just really frightening like that's,
that's a mom.

1177
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.830
That's going to be somebody's mom.
Now My,
our why our hanger,

1178
01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.290
all right,
Bill is another story of revenge.

1179
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:12.520
Um,
you know what?
There was what that story could think.

1180
01:15:12.521 --> 01:15:13.810
I'm being a jerk to that person.

1181
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:16.990
It's that the guy really didn't do anything to you,
you know,

1182
01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.840
and he was a lame dude.
He was a loser.

1183
01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.670
You had dumped him and then his life continued to go down the toilet

1184
01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:26.831
and I know,

1185
01:15:26.831 --> 01:15:30.610
and you're just enjoying him getting dizzy as he goes down and I don't fucking

1186
01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:34.690
get,
anyways.
Anyways,
here we go.
Here we go,
Brent.
Story number two,

1187
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:38.170
about 20 years ago I was living in downtown Chicago by the way.

1188
01:15:38.171 --> 01:15:43.120
This person is like,
I know I read really bad out loud,
but this guy is typing,

1189
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:45.100
eat,
and even a smaller type.

1190
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:48.190
I don't understand.

1191
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.610
Can you guys type a little bit bigger and don't be a con and just give me the

1192
01:15:51.611 --> 01:15:54.550
biggest size.
Okay.
That's really a second grade joke.
All right.

1193
01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.640
We're trying to do something serious here.
People do whatever you want.

1194
01:15:57.641 --> 01:16:01.360
I don't give a fuck and I'll sit here and start it through the emails bill.
Okay.

1195
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:02.650
Let me get out my magnifying glass.

1196
01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:06.760
About 20 years ago I was living in downtown Chicago and a high rise that had a

1197
01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:08.470
multilevel parking garage.

1198
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:12.970
I paid a monthly fee and had a designated covered spot.

1199
01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.120
Skye was doing great.
It sounded like you worked like one of those.

1200
01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:20.920
Fuck Oh 20 years ago.
I think he was selling health insurance.
Um,
anyways,

1201
01:16:20.921 --> 01:16:25.921
one night I came home to find another car parked in my assigned spot and sense

1202
01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:29.140
it was about 2:00 AM I just said fuck it.
You know,

1203
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:33.850
and drove to the roof deck where there was always plenty of open spaces and

1204
01:16:33.851 --> 01:16:38.851
about 10:00 AM I was looking out the window of my apartment and I saw a tow

1205
01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:42.880
truck driving down Lasalle Street with my car attached to the back.

1206
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:46.630
Since I was on the 18th floor,
there was no chance to catch the tow trucks,

1207
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:51.100
so I went down to the office and ask the manager management why my car was
towed.

1208
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:53.620
She said that I was parked in someone else's spot.

1209
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:58.090
I explained that someone was parked in my spot and that there was probably 30

1210
01:16:58.091 --> 01:16:59.620
empty spots on the roof deck.

1211
01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.630
Plus the fact that my car had a sticker on the windshield showed that I was a

1212
01:17:04.631 --> 01:17:08.190
resident.
She said that there was nothing she could do and I asked,

1213
01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:11.540
so I asked to speak to the person who had my car towed.

1214
01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.020
She called the girl who had my car towed and she came down to the office.

1215
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:19.580
She was a total content about the whole situation in the assisted that she did

1216
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:22.910
the right thing.
Well,
since I couldn't blast this cunt in the face,

1217
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:27.650
I decided to take revenge on her car since I knew exactly where she parked.

1218
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:32.930
Once again,
revenge is coming back to fucking up somebody's car.

1219
01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.140
All right,
so here we go.
Here is the revenge.

1220
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:41.410
I waited about two months and then I got a syringe from my mother who was a

1221
01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:42.530
diabetic.

1222
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.470
Did you make sure she had an extra one lb?
Didn't take her last one.
See,

1223
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.690
see what happens when you go down the road of revenge.
Next thing you know,

1224
01:17:53.691 --> 01:17:56.810
you stealing syringes from your mom.
So anyways,

1225
01:17:56.811 --> 01:18:00.140
I still the syringe from my mom who's a diabetic.
Uh,

1226
01:18:00.170 --> 01:18:04.040
then I went to a sporting good store and bought [inaudible],

1227
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:06.830
which is basically deer urine.

1228
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:13.180
I then proceed to load the syringe with Rut and I injected in it.

1229
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:18.530
I injected it into all the rubber moldings around the windows of this girl's

1230
01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:21.020
cars.
It smelled awful.

1231
01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.670
My parking spot was one level below or spot and I could smell it every day.

1232
01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:32.060
I know that taking revenge on a car is a wimpy move,
but it did feel good.

1233
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:37.310
Always remember,
revenge is a dish best served cold.

1234
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.350
Jesus Christ.
Wow Man,

1235
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:44.480
you went like fucking CIA on that.

1236
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.410
That's like something they would miss him like the autopsy cause it's little

1237
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:52.610
fucking needle fucking holes.
Um,

1238
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:57.080
I got to admit that that is definitely a,
I mean fucking up.

1239
01:18:57.081 --> 01:18:59.640
Somebody's car's not too original butter.
That is uh,

1240
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:05.360
that dude you grew up in the backwoods.
No city kid knows about Rut.

1241
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:10.460
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You grew up in the backwoods.

1242
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.130
You did,
didn't you?
You mom's a diabetic,
you know,
living in a trailer,

1243
01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:17.630
ate off of George Foreman Grill.

1244
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:21.770
You're going to show everybody in your high school class that you were better

1245
01:19:21.771 --> 01:19:25.130
than this.
She got some big fancy job.
You lived in a high rise.

1246
01:19:25.131 --> 01:19:29.930
You had your own spot,
you know,
and you will looking out your window,

1247
01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:32.660
looking out over the south street's stroke and your cock,

1248
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:36.170
and you thought you had the whole world by the balls.
And what happened?

1249
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.180
They told you fucking Mazda Miata right out of your God damn spot.

1250
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:43.700
Right in a brought,
you're right back to your childhood,
didn't it?

1251
01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.340
And then you took revenge the same way those kids took revenge on you in second

1252
01:19:49.341 --> 01:19:53.430
grade.
I don't want to fuck him going with this shit.
All right,
let's,

1253
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.260
let's go to this next one.
Uh,
all right,
Bill.
Uh,

1254
01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:57.730
it's just another story of revenge bell.

1255
01:19:57.731 --> 01:19:59.750
So I did it check for two years on and off,

1256
01:19:59.751 --> 01:20:02.840
and this is my first real girlfriend in high school and I thought she was the

1257
01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:07.560
perfect,
most amazing girl in the world.
I was an idiot and like 17 old,

1258
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:11.490
I'm still an idiot,
23,
but I sure as hell won't let this crap happen again.

1259
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:15.000
Anyways,
I let her walk all over me and I just took it like a bitch.

1260
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:19.350
It was the kind of thing where she could fucking cheat on me in front of me.

1261
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:23.490
And I believe her.
If she told me she wasn't,
I was,
I was that fucking pathetic.

1262
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:24.511
Eventually though,

1263
01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:27.180
after hearing that your girlfriend is cheating on you for so long,

1264
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.110
it eats away at you.
Can you hear the foreboding music in the background?

1265
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:35.610
Eventually she posted some bullshit poem on my space,
on my space.

1266
01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:39.630
About some dude she was going out with at the same time she was going out with

1267
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:43.350
me.
Wow.
That's pretty bold.

1268
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:46.590
And anyway,
she goes,
the Fucker,
uh,

1269
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:50.220
who she was cheating with even had the balls to post on there talking about how

1270
01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:53.820
sweet she was.
So finally I had my proof.

1271
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:59.220
She wasn't getting out of this and here comes the revenge till I actually

1272
01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:03.360
messaged the guy and start telling him that I'd been fucking her the whole time

1273
01:21:03.361 --> 01:21:04.440
that he's been going out with her.

1274
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:09.800
He starts telling me that he even knows of her cheating on him and he took her

1275
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:14.850
back.
So we teamed up to destroyer.
See,
see,

1276
01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:18.570
this is,
this is,
this is where it goes wrong.
This is where it gets evil.

1277
01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.790
This is why I do not partake.

1278
01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:25.820
They're teaming up now to destroy another thing and this is how it plays out.

1279
01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.690
All right,
here we go.
By this time I was out of high school and they were both,

1280
01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:33.420
and uh,
wait a minute,

1281
01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:36.510
but this time I was out of high school and they were both at the same high

1282
01:21:36.511 --> 01:21:38.040
school.
I guess the guy.

1283
01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:42.600
And this girl basically I showed up to her school and what we did was bring up

1284
01:21:42.601 --> 01:21:47.601
all this shit that she did up in the middle of all her little fucking friends.

1285
01:21:48.331 --> 01:21:49.770
She cared about so much.

1286
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:54.390
She cares so much about and explained how much of a horse she was.

1287
01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:58.860
Other dues even came up and said they were going out with her at the same time.

1288
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:04.080
I was fucking her and shit.
This bitch was the fucking public bicycle.

1289
01:22:04.081 --> 01:22:09.030
Everyone was riding with a completely ruined the rest of high school for now.

1290
01:22:09.031 --> 01:22:10.500
Five or six years later,

1291
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:14.040
me and the dude are still friends because a wind,

1292
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.010
there's a wind for the guys who got treated like shit out there.
Yeah,

1293
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:23.340
it is.
Yeah.
I guess it would have just fucking,
I dunno man.

1294
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:27.690
I cut my losses,
cut my losses.

1295
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:32.670
That reminds me of an of an intervention story where there was this girl whose

1296
01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:36.060
dad didn't stick around.
So,
uh,
she,
I dunno what,

1297
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:41.190
and she developed young and,
uh,
the guys be like,
Hey,
let me see a titties.

1298
01:22:41.191 --> 01:22:42.330
And she just showed them to him,

1299
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.630
not realize she just liked the fucking male attention.

1300
01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:49.170
So she's dancing as a cheerleader and I gotta I dunno what she did.

1301
01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:50.460
She blew a couple of guys.

1302
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:55.380
And so she's dancing as a cheerleader and the hope her,
her entire college,

1303
01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.880
I mean,
high school class just started chanting whore,
whore,
whore,

1304
01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:01.110
whore or something like that.

1305
01:23:01.111 --> 01:23:03.990
And then she burst into tears and then she became a fucking alcoholic.

1306
01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:07.630
You know what I'm saying?
But you know something,
you don't,

1307
01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:10.960
you don't have the mentality to know that at that age and I show wasn't on.

1308
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.580
So why am I playing armchair quarterback and ruining your event?

1309
01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:21.430
I Dunno.
Revenge.
Ya Know,
Maya,
I don't know.
Fucking creepy man.

1310
01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:27.490
We ruined the rest of high school for and then we high fived and kicked a puppy.

1311
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:32.770
All right,
here we go.
Overrated.
Underrated.
This is the last thing here.
Um,

1312
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:35.620
overrated and this is something that I've been meaning to bring up.

1313
01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:38.860
This is one of the eye overrated that I agree with.

1314
01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:43.660
I think the most overrated multi-blade raisers.
A few months ago,

1315
01:23:43.661 --> 01:23:48.661
I started using my dad's old double h double edged razor made almost 20 years

1316
01:23:48.911 --> 01:23:51.730
ago before I was born.
Born.
It's fucking great.

1317
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:55.300
My face feels better than ever and I can get a hundred blades for less than what

1318
01:23:55.301 --> 01:23:59.560
it costs for an eight pack of those three or five blade cartridges.
Um,

1319
01:23:59.561 --> 01:24:03.970
if you got to shave like a man and introduce an element of danger to it.

1320
01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:05.560
I actually have a couple of straight razors too,

1321
01:24:05.561 --> 01:24:08.100
but it's too much work and I don't use them on a regular basis though.

1322
01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:09.760
There's nothing.
Sure.
Those fucking,

1323
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:12.490
one of the worst things that ever happened me on the road was I left my

1324
01:24:12.491 --> 01:24:15.640
toiletries behind I think in Tampa a long time ago.

1325
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:19.510
Not only did I use lose my little tough crowd,
uh,

1326
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.340
a shaving kit bag,
I lost that fucking thing.

1327
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:27.190
Um,
and I,

1328
01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:32.191
I lost my twin twin blade razor and then I went onto the triple red blazer and I

1329
01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:35.860
have a whisker underneath my nose that it just can't get,
it just doesn't get it.

1330
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:39.070
It sucks around your Chin itch.
It's terrible.

1331
01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:43.960
The two blade razor is the shit and you will never get a closer shave than that.

1332
01:24:43.961 --> 01:24:46.750
Everything else is fucking bullshit.
I was wondering though,
what about the,

1333
01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:51.130
you've seen those things on TV?
We can sharpen your razor blades.
Anybody.
I mean,

1334
01:24:51.131 --> 01:24:54.610
anybody buy one of those?
Huh?
Is this podcast going on?
Well,
my God.

1335
01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:58.990
53 more minutes.
I gotta get Outta here.
Alright.
Underrated.
Uh,
your podcast.

1336
01:24:58.991 --> 01:25:01.900
It's fucking great.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Uh,

1337
01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:05.110
here's another good one.
Overrated.
Chickson bars and clubs,

1338
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.060
underrated chicks at the laundromat.

1339
01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.540
The skill set in these two groups is so far off.
It's ridiculous.

1340
01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:14.500
Chickson bars and clubs just spackle on so much makeup that they can barely hold

1341
01:25:14.501 --> 01:25:18.220
their heads up long enough to accept your drink before they shoot you down.

1342
01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:23.850
But Dude,
dramatic pause raising my eyebrows type shit.
Um,

1343
01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.490
he actually typed up,
um,
helping me with my reading ability.
I liked that.

1344
01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:31.870
I liked direction,
but dude,
a chicken,
the laundromat is so sexy.

1345
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:36.370
It's crazy.
They're wearing probably the last clean shit that they own.

1346
01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.900
That's just a little too tight.
They don't,
they don't put on makeup.
So dude,

1347
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.640
you're really sounding like a pervert right now.

1348
01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:46.440
You how they were in that last piece of clean closet they got,
yeah,

1349
01:25:46.450 --> 01:25:49.500
that's one of the two tight
down,

1350
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.560
put any makeup on and then they're pretty at that moment and they look

1351
01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:54.570
unbelievable.
And you know,

1352
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:57.190
you don't like to have for the rest of the time and just reading the rest of

1353
01:25:57.191 --> 01:25:59.950
your shit like a pervert.
Actually.
Dude,
you're actually,
you're right.

1354
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.360
He makes some great points there.

1355
01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:06.090
Plus they're doing some responsible while they're hung over and they're trying

1356
01:26:06.091 --> 01:26:09.060
not to throw up when they're newly clean clothes.
Sorry,
I went too long.

1357
01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:14.480
He had dude,
you did.
You actually make a great point.
You do.
Yeah,
you did.

1358
01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:17.040
All right.
That's the end of the podcast.
Okay.
Kind of petered out.

1359
01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:21.750
Kind of like the Colorado River,
not reaching the ocean anymore.
Um,

1360
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.251
anyways,

1361
01:26:23.251 --> 01:26:28.230
before I'm going to be in Saint Louis this week at the house of comedy,

1362
01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:31.380
um,
I have the link right there on my website.

1363
01:26:31.381 --> 01:26:34.500
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com B U R r.com.

1364
01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:39.530
And I want to thank everybody who came out to my Monday shows at the punchline

1365
01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:43.680
in San Francisco.
I really wish I talked about that in the beginning.
Um,

1366
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.890
being honest with you,
those were two of the best shows I've ever had in my life.

1367
01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:52.680
Um,
that second show,
it was ridiculous.
Um,
for those of you who weren't there,

1368
01:26:52.681 --> 01:26:55.350
I just started telling stories and uh,

1369
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.010
I probably did close to an hour and a half,

1370
01:26:59.011 --> 01:27:02.690
15 minutes of which was actually from my act.

1371
01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.490
So,
uh,
you know,

1372
01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.280
it was all material I'm never going to do again because it was all family

1373
01:27:08.281 --> 01:27:12.750
stories and fucked up shit that I would never talk about on TV.
So,
um,

1374
01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.980
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

1375
01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:18.630
I had a great time and I'm thinking about coming up there again in a couple of

1376
01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:23.220
months at the punchline and maybe having that be a regular thing,

1377
01:27:23.221 --> 01:27:24.570
just coming up on Mondays and do one,

1378
01:27:24.571 --> 01:27:29.520
a couple of shows and just venting about the people in my life,

1379
01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:35.550
you know,
and I'm not having to worry about them ever hearing about it.
All right.

1380
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:38.790
And,
uh,
that is it.
Thank you for listening to the podcast.

1381
01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.120
Thank you guys for contributing.
And,
uh,

1382
01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.540
what else?
Oh,
well,
you know what,
I,

1383
01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:49.100
people have been asking me about my myspace page,
asks him about the comments.
Um,

1384
01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:54.060
I kinda haven't been adding accepting comments since last September.

1385
01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:55.860
I just kind of forgot about it.

1386
01:27:55.890 --> 01:27:58.430
I just was adding friends and answering emails that you get.

1387
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.790
The podcast took up a lot of times.
So I'm back to accepting comments.

1388
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.690
I literally had like 400 or 600 comments.

1389
01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.010
It didn't allow me to,
uh,
you know,
here it is.
Comment approvals.

1390
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:14.430
I'll click on this right now.
This is,
this is garbage time right now.

1391
01:28:14.431 --> 01:28:15.690
You don't even need to listen to this shit.
