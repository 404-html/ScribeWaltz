00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.350
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:05.550
Just before Friday,

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.690
Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.750
I'm just checking in on you.
You can hear from the breathing and the background.

5
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:16.590
I usually do not have guests.
That's not something that I do,

6
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:19.770
but every once in a while I get a maniac in here.

7
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:21.690
Somebody who's fucking raring to go.

8
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.950
You might recognize this guy from his own fucking chest.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900
This man could talk about sports.
Seek and talk about the hip hop and the rap.

10
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.310
He can talk about the real housewives.
He's an actor.
He's a director.

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.840
He's out of breath.
Ladies and gentleman,
he's a,

12
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:41.520
he's one of the biggest Boston sports fans I've ever met.

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
Welcome back to the podcast,
your friend and mine.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.440
Mr. Michael Rappaport.
Glad to be here,
Bill Burr.
How are you feeling man,

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.840
I wish I could.
Uh,
I had the words,
the words,

16
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:56.220
I mean shipped to paint a picture of what,
what,
what,
what's going on here?

17
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.670
Like we're sitting on our couch or your couch here.
Here in your crib.

18
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.530
We both have on half see socks as he sucks.
I went white.
You went black shorts.

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.830
Yup.

20
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.780
Almost similar shorts but different color coordination and it's like this is,

21
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.520
this is a sad fucking sight for sore eyes were probably two of the most

22
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:18.930
undesirable white men in a,
in Hollywood.
That's real shit.
Maybe in the country,

23
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:23.430
like if,
if someone came in like soil,
like what?
This looks sad fucking site.

24
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.030
You told any woman you marry a white guy 15 years in,

25
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:29.160
this is what you're going to have.
He like,

26
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:33.750
he'd be like the worst thing for white people ever.
Like just across the board.

27
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.860
Like the picture of of me and bill burr with half see socks on.

28
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.930
But dude,
I'm barely covering the ankle.
I got on the Chrissy Everett,
you,

29
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.510
you got on,
you got on,
you got on headphones.
I mean this is a sorry fucking site,

30
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.520
but I'm happy to be on the pod.
I know you requested to come on.

31
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:54.360
You seemed like you had some things that you needed to get off your chest.

32
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:57.820
Now this,
this,
you know,
for people who aren't,
aren't in your world or my world.

33
00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:00.300
Yes.
Maybe just passing by on the Internet.
Yes,

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.390
I am from the Boston area and I support,
you know,

35
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:06.450
we have 14 so we just need one in each sport to win a championship.

36
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:11.100
You guys in New York needs like what 15 three,
four yes.
Well for each sport.

37
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:14.900
For each sport.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Exactly.
And then when things come Greensboro.

38
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.270
Yeah,
we'll steal them from jersey.
We bring me on Brooklyn,
half of Lids.

39
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.330
It's just New York teams.
Yeah,
it's,
it's not a problem.

40
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.270
I notice on your computer you have your,

41
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:27.490
your facetime camera covering ups.

42
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.800
Do you think so I do that on,
I'd do that on the TV.
I do it on everything.

43
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.000
I would do it.
No one's looking,
you know that no one's like no one's shit.

44
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.700
Like if people were looking they wouldn't be looking.
That's not true.

45
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.460
You think they're looking for you?
Oh,
what was,
I forget who it was.

46
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.080
Somebody with the TV kind of got busted.

47
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.810
So what are you doing in here that needs to be covered up?

48
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.950
Just like in your general general,
like day in and day out because well,

49
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.590
the laptop becomes like this on video camera.
So what if I'm here?

50
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.660
What if I'm on the couch and all of a sudden my wife comes and we started

51
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:58.470
banging and there's some guy at Yahoo fucking rubbing one out with his lab coat

52
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:02.320
on.
I mean,
I should at least get some money.
Do Amateur Porn.
No,

53
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.450
now you have a beautiful,
or if I watch porn,

54
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.330
I don't want to say to somebody seen me going like rubbing one out,

55
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.800
but you in a porno.
I don't think anyone's going to be able to get me in a porno.

56
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.250
Just,
just footage of me rubbing one out.
I don't need that out there.
I don't,

57
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.880
I that we're trying to go Disney.
I hear,
I'm trying to hit on that chair.

58
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.600
I hear you.
I hear you.
Um Oh,
it's all creepy.
But they still can like,
you know,

59
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.680
so you keep the tape on for security measures.
I,
I hear,
I primarily do it too.

60
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.680
I hear you.
I hear you.
So this is the thing.
If that fucking thing,

61
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:32.500
I think they live in the fucking the future,
right?
Look,
look,

62
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.250
look at how much shit I can store on this fucking and who the fuck am I?
Right.

63
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.540
And I'm just,
you don't know nothing.

64
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:40.080
I'm just a regular freckled cunt walking down the street.
That's it.

65
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.590
Just one of many,
one of many.
One of many things special on dodging the sun.

66
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.610
That's it.
Going from palm tree,
the palm tree out here.
I mean fuck man.

67
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.530
Wait,
who's got whiter legs?
I got it.

68
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.090
You're not scared of the sun the way I am.
I'm fascinated by that.
I was like,
Yo,

69
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.950
I mean you should be the spokes.
You should have like a son,
like a Sun Tan sun,

70
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.731
a sunblock,

71
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:08.230
sponsorship like you're fucking white and I'm super white,

72
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.500
but like you matched the wall color in here.
I don't go out in the sun.

73
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.060
I mean I like with my dog,
I'll get a little bit of a farmer's Freckleton sorry,

74
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.700
did I knock this over?
Yeah,
she said he's in broken.
No,
no,
it's fine.

75
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.900
Leave it on the floor.
Leave it on the shore.
Yeah,
just looking on the phone.

76
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.370
You you've done quite enough of right.
Sorry.
All right,
well listen,

77
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.460
let's bring it out to the people.
Let's tell the people what happened.

78
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:31.450
I saw you at a,
we were at a very big fancy Hollywood party the other night,

79
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:33.130
but low key.
It's like,

80
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.960
to me that party is a low key Hollywood party because it's a private party with

81
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.180
a lot of cool,

82
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:44.620
interesting sort of different sort of La show business people.
But I've,

83
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.080
I've gone to that party three or four times and actually the last time I

84
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:50.560
actually went out was at this party.
I've never been to it every time.

85
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.750
Every year I'm always on the road.
Right.
But I had,
I made it this year.
Yeah,

86
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.840
it's a good towards having a great time.
And then you showed up and,

87
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.150
and this is about 1145 on a Saturday.

88
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.740
And before I even was able to give you five,
we were like 20 feet away.

89
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.500
You say what?
To me now this is the God's honest truth.

90
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.950
I want to make sure we're on the same page here.
We was pretty buzzed,

91
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:15.520
but I believe sitting dude,
Bill Belicheck,
if he wins or had,
he already won,

92
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.900
I already won.
Greatest of all time.
That's not what you started with tonight.

93
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.360
I remember exactly what you said because I was about 25 to 30 feet away.

94
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:26.220
You said this is before.
How you doing Mike?
Before I,

95
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.390
where's your wife before?
What's up?
Good to see you for 25 to 30 feet away.

96
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.980
Three and,
oh motherfucker.
Three in fucking old.

97
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.340
And then you went on the bill Bellacheck right?
And then I said to,

98
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.100
and then I said to you,
I want the new way in.

99
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:43.580
And you said this is the old system.
It's so foolish.

100
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.120
That's where you're not right.
And you're now I want to,

101
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:50.200
I am here to explain this to you.
Bill burr not correct you when you're done,

102
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.280
check this out.
I want them to go for no.
Okay.

103
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.780
And what I really want to happen because I knit,
but not for any reason.
No.
Ooh,

104
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.960
careful.
Just as good as talk radio,
which you in there.

105
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.060
But you buffalo wild wings.

106
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.990
Fucking let me hasten to deal order and Jackie,

107
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.430
let me tell you my point of view.

108
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:15.431
I want them to go for no and then lose the first game back with Tommy and that

109
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.000
will,
you guys will be all fucked up.
Our will.
We will be all bent out of shape.

110
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.160
Then sort of create a cough.
Then if they look,

111
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.280
what if they lost two in a row with Tommy and Garappolo sitting on there and

112
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:27.650
what does that mean?
I'm just saying,
damn,

113
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.530
that's win super bowls he got to us or how,
let's see if,
let's see the pressure.

114
00:06:31.531 --> 00:06:36.260
Has He know the Patriots not deal with facts.
Crazy look fancy,
right?

115
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.080
Cheesy.
Exactly.
If we stay right here in the present,
yes.

116
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:43.490
Three nor his fucking hall of fame career.
Absolutely were like,
who is this guy?

117
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.870
Is it,
is it?
Is it Frank Brady?
What's his name?
Tommy.

118
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.890
Let's stay in the present too.
We don't even know this guy's name then.

119
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.410
Then I could be,
who the fuck is this guy that just fucking brought in?
Oh No,
no,

120
00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:55.760
no,
no.

121
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.030
Then I can get to where you're at making it seem like I don't think Tom Brady is

122
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.380
great.
That's what I wanted to,

123
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.830
I come here to tell you I am going to try get what you're saying.

124
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.110
I get what you're saying.
You're just saying all you want is,

125
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.980
is some Dan Shaughnessy horseshit cause that's the only Chinese man.

126
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.870
So what are you worried about them but totally overwhelmed.
I honestly,

127
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.070
what are you worried about?
I asked you this arrest twice.
I know that.
Um,
but I,

128
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:19.100
I gotta be honest with you.
My,

129
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.500
you're like one of the only uncool giant fans I've ever met.

130
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.420
John Fans never talked shit.
They don't need to,
we don't need a tool.
Yeah,

131
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:27.860
but you do.
But I,
cause you know what it is sadness and you know there's,

132
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:31.630
it's a sad,
sad,
I'm trying to say this.

133
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.660
I know that this is a heavily Boston like your,
your,
your core core people.

134
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:38.030
You or your worldwide,

135
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:42.110
You went on a copy toward Cape Man.
Yo,
you went on a comedy tour worldwide.

136
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:46.400
That's crazy to me.
That's crazy to me because it's like that,
that comedy,

137
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:47.211
I know it happens,

138
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:52.211
but I think that I'm so fascinated and respect that that comedy can translate

139
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:53.630
worldwide.
No,
it's all English,

140
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:55.880
but I think that's fucking does a lot of your worldwide,

141
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.210
you're worldwide a freckle concept.
Yes.
We're around the globe.

142
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.070
But your essence is a Boston fuck true.
We rendered Yestermorrow yeah,

143
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.840
right or wrong barrier insult and then try to run away from it.

144
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.770
They were boss to fuck true.
Ooh.
Did right or wrong,
just called me a postie.

145
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:12.100
You bought Boston.
Fuck.
Correct.
So,
so no,
I'm not,
you're not.

146
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.200
You're born and raised in,
I'm from the suburbs,

147
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.950
but it's an avenue expense.
You know,

148
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.480
they only time I was in Boston was when we first met doing um,
the heat,

149
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.090
the heat.
That was the first and only time I've ever been in Boston.

150
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.770
And you know her Boston,
thanks you for that.
They had enough.

151
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.320
They're like,
that's all you're going to get.
No,
dude,
this is the thing.

152
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.170
What happened was nobody knew shit about Boston.

153
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.020
And then goodwill hunting comes out and then everybody thinks that you have

154
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.790
anybody from,
from Boston.

155
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:46.670
Anybody from Massachusetts is from southeast still cars.

156
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:49.680
Do you like apples and you're good at math?
It was just a fun,

157
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.600
it was just a fucking movie.
I'm supposed to fucking movie.
I was,

158
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:56.340
I always say ever since that movie out.
All right.
I just

159
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.090
<v 1>cause like new kids on the block then puts you on the map.
What do you mean?</v>

160
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.960
Like the group new kids on the block.
Like new kids on the block.
How boy band.

161
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.270
Yeah.
I'm saying you guys weren't proud of new kids on the black.
No,

162
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:07.800
I must say when we were proud of,
when we were happy,

163
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:11.070
some local kids made it put like,
yeah,
boy band does not put a city on the map.

164
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.180
I'm just saying they weren't,
you know,

165
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:17.181
why does run running the table fucking every championship with just four teams.

166
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.550
But the thing that I want to acknowledge and I want you,
I want to try to get to,

167
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:23.160
I want you to see,
I love that you said that you've never been to Boston.

168
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.610
I haven't only that one time.
Can I tell you that's why I went over.

169
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.330
You say Boston has this inferiority complex to New York in sports and I just can

170
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:32.460
I just finish please sir.
Okay.

171
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.010
It's for nobody knows shit about New York and Boston unless you've been there.

172
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.090
I remember when I first moved there,

173
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:42.000
this is how little we knew despite how much we hated the Yankees.

174
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.160
And it was always just the Yankees.
It wasn't really a jets.

175
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:48.030
Jazz was none of that horse shit.
Right.
Um,
and even when we lost to the mets,

176
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.570
it wasn't like the fucking,
and we,
we've met them one time and it was more,

177
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:54.060
there was no rivalry.
It was bill Buckner.
Folks happens.

178
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.420
And why did you have Calvin Shrine?
You know,
I'm not a baseball guy.
Well,

179
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:01.560
let me finish.
Let me finish.
Which guys,
Bill Buckler let me finish this.

180
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.580
Let me finish this.
All right.
Yeah.
To do this.

181
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.670
How can you like think that that's still bugs me.

182
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:09.240
I watched that highlight now when I laugh.
Which one?
The Buckner what?

183
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.750
Which one is that?
I don't,
you know,
I'm not a baseball games.
Six Games,
six.

184
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:14.280
I'll walk you through it.
Okay.
What happens?

185
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.590
A ground ball went down the fucking between his legs.

186
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:21.020
I could stopped it with my parents and bill Buckner played for the red sox.

187
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.560
Okay.
I'm sorry.
You know I,
I know basketball,
no football.
Baseball.
So sad.
Okay.

188
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:26.520
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

189
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.900
Are you still giving me shit about the fact that Oh four happen and we won three

190
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.690
world series since then?
No,
I was just trying to get more sacks.

191
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.590
Stanley Cup championship and an NBA champ.
You don't want you to do right now.

192
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:41.340
You're wearing your high school jacket going.
Remember 86 I can't,

193
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:44.750
I get confused about baseball.
They're halfway there.

194
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.170
Come on dude.
That's fucking,
that was 30 years ago.
They focus,

195
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:52.770
they focus on the finish.
This story that you were telling me,
I am focused.

196
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.600
I know what to tell him ahead.
Go ahead.

197
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.870
I just wanted to get clear on Buckner cause some people you said they might be

198
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:01.140
passing to pay,
they might not know the reference.
They might know the ref now.

199
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.540
Crazy legs.
Johnson fumble the ball for the,
uh,
the Ohio.
Who gives a fuck in 1930.

200
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.960
I mean,
I'm sure if the people who live in the Columbus area still devastated.

201
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.560
Okay,
go ahead.
You're ready.
Go ahead.
And I'm,
yeah,
so when I moved to New York,

202
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.060
yes.
Oh,
I told him you would live in New York.
I moved there.
Yeah.

203
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:19.530
And my buddy goes,
he says to me,
where do you live in New York?
And I said,

204
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.520
I live on a 97th,
and third.
And he just goes,
do what's,

205
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:25.080
what's with all the numbers down there?

206
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.700
Like why are all state's number like he didn't know fucking anything about like

207
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:34.080
we don't know,
like that whole inferiority complex.
You guys do this now it's,

208
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:39.000
it's manufactured by ESPN.
I understand that.
You want us to,
you want us to,

209
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.610
nobody gives a shit about me.
You only gives a shit about New Yorkers.

210
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.270
New Yorkers.
Listen,
listen guys,
all fucking you guys,

211
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.300
even though the Tad's steaks and you get yourself a slice and you do your sad

212
00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:54.610
stakes in a slice it,
you do your in Times Square,

213
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.120
<v 0>right?
One of the,
one of the worst fucking places in America.
Absolutely.</v>

214
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:00.430
Absolutely.
Every hip hop video they're in,
they're like,

215
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:04.330
we made it the fucking m and m store in Times Square is a fucking wreck.

216
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.560
Every city must have like Hollywood boulevard is the same thing.
Yeah,
but,

217
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.590
but what do you guys have that similar cheers?
What do you mean cheers?

218
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:16.000
The Bar Yours and you're going like a whole neighborhood.
You got cheers.
Yeah,

219
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:20.350
because boss,
you see him.
You see what I'm saying though?
Giant cheesy area.
Yeah,

220
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.350
but it's,
it's for the,
you know,
the betterment of the city.
It's called midtown.

221
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:25.480
But you guys have one street where this happens.

222
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.010
Just trying to get a map in my head cause I did not.
I'll,
I'll get,
yeah,

223
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.260
and everything else is authentic.
We don't waste it with all that other shit.

224
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:33.041
I mean,
yeah,
you can go,

225
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:36.520
you can put on a Paul revere hat and walked down the freeway.
Do you want to?

226
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.571
But other than that,

227
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:40.930
it's a bunch of great bars and people can actually talk sports,
good food,

228
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.740
tremendous food.
Um,
a bunch of characters out there.

229
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:47.760
Everybody's fucking funny up there.
There's really not a,
in sports,

230
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.320
you weren't into sports.
You,
you would actually love Boston.

231
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.890
When I was there for the two or three weeks while we were working together.

232
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.460
I liked it.
Good Restaurants,
nice people.
Easy to get around,

233
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.560
a maneuverable.
Um,
that's the same thing,
but we'll give it to you,
you know,

234
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.910
maneuverable.
You know,
like you could take a train,
you could like,
you could the,

235
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.450
there's the train,
right?
Yeah,
I would,

236
00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:09.250
I would have just said good public transportation.
The bus,
right.

237
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:12.700
You could take cabs.
There's Uber's,
I did all of it.
You could walk.
I walked,

238
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.060
I got lost.
What?
You were in a city and you took advantage of it.

239
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.130
I took a village.
It was a good city.
It's a good city.

240
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.130
But there is that sort of the reason that sort of like,

241
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:24.460
you know lesser than sort of feeling that you guys have one spoiled a lot of

242
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:28.220
games.
What do you like?
Like the lesson comes up when you guys are three.

243
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:35.120
I like that fucking chick who never has a boyfriend and then goes like,

244
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.840
you know what guys are just intimidated by me.
They can't handle high,

245
00:13:38.841 --> 00:13:40.790
Blah Blah Blah and you want to be like lady.

246
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:44.780
Do you ever think that maybe you kind of cut?
No,
that's hilarious.

247
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.660
You're walking around like ordering a sandwich and you just felt like as they

248
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:51.140
were making the sandwich that they was sitting there thinking inferior thoughts

249
00:13:51.141 --> 00:13:53.110
to New York City.
Do you really this sport,

250
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.430
that's one of the most self centered thing anymore.

251
00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.680
It's 1130 that door anymore.
1130 at night.
Why are you screaming at me?

252
00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:04.970
Three and eight oh three and I mean I'll tell you why.
Your wife was like,

253
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:07.870
she walked away and like see,
everybody's embarrassed.
People are nervous.

254
00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:10.550
You got a shaved head and people are freaking out.
Look at your,

255
00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:13.430
now you're exaggerating.
I mean a little bit like three and old like,
Yo,

256
00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:16.960
I'm fucking whacked out of my tree and you're talking to me about three and I'm

257
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:20.120
trying to let,
let me,
let me shake your hand.
Burn like that's what I'm saying.

258
00:14:20.121 --> 00:14:23.330
Like I know you three are no,
I know Bella check is fantastic.

259
00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.690
I know Brady's coming back to you right now.
No,
I bought the inferiority complex.

260
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.600
Let me,
no,
it has to do with you during this three in o streak.

261
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.170
Constantly shitting on Tom Brady.
Constant Shit.

262
00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:36.480
So I was just rubbing in your face.
The set.
Let me ask you a question.

263
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.960
If you walked into that party and we were all in three,
ha ha ha.

264
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.400
You're going to tell me you would have said hello.

265
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.410
I love you because you're actually,
you'll actually fucking,

266
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:48.400
you'll go with if I get you with a good no,

267
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:52.070
I got to acknowledge your fans because we made bet that hasn't been

268
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.740
<v 1>dealt with.
Cause I've gotten,
I've gotten a lot is made to,</v>

269
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.360
you still owe me a dinner for the NBA finals?
No,
just one bet you NBA finals.

270
00:14:58.361 --> 00:14:59.280
You still owe me.
I know,

271
00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:03.830
but I want to acknowledge it because I got your fans a few times a day.

272
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.850
Did you fucking pay Bill Bell?
Berber his bet.
Have you taken burnout?

273
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.300
This is on Twitter and you know,
I don't mind I tweed Blah Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

274
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.540
But I'm getting like a sense,
I want to acknowledge that it hasn't happened,

275
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:17.840
but it's,
would you say it's a scheduling issue?
Uh,
yeah.

276
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:20.780
I would definitely say it's a scam.
You're traveling.
I'm traveling.
You're moving,

277
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:25.340
you're grooving.
You're overseas.
How maneuverable you on buses?
On subways.

278
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.390
You were in Greece?
No,
I was in Ireland.

279
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.620
Didn't you tell me you were in Greece?
Italy.
Italy.
Yeah,
on a beach.

280
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.690
You're on the beach.
They can roam.
Yeah,
but I had a giant umbrella.
But I mean,

281
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:41.060
we're like,
what was that like?
I've never been like,
I've been,

282
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.470
I've been to Rome and I've been to Venice,

283
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:45.860
but I'd never been to the beaches of Italy.
So it was,
what was that trip like?

284
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.210
The Amalfi coast?
It was,
it was beautiful.
It's extremely touristy.

285
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.490
The food isn't as good as it is.
And when I was in Rome,
when,

286
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.820
yeah,
it was,
I was in Rome.
I couldn't miss when I was,
it's incredible.

287
00:15:58.821 --> 00:16:02.870
When I was on the Amalfi coast,
like I had to ask around.
I mean,

288
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.380
I'm going to look,

289
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.560
I had the best eggplant parm or Sean I've ever had in my life when I was there.

290
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.540
Granted,
I didn't order it in Rome,
but in Raam,
dude,

291
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.620
I just couldn't fucking miss missing a diner and Rome.
People go,

292
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:15.270
you went to Rome,
you should go to Florence,
you should go to Venice.

293
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:17.040
She should go to Milan and I'll,
I'll look fucking tweets.

294
00:16:17.041 --> 00:16:20.390
I'm going to get now everybody,
like everybody on the Internet and whatever.

295
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:24.560
You did this the wrong fucking thing to do.
You know why you're right.
Yeah.

296
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.420
You know what I mean?
I can bullshit.
You cannot say a Rome,

297
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.510
Italy.
You Fuck,
you're an asshole.
How dare you?

298
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.280
Anything you say every single thing you say it's,
it's literally like you,

299
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:41.450
you can't,
unless it's fact checked.
But I like it though,
cause it's a great,
like,

300
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:45.290
it reminds me a litmus test.
Hey,
it's just,
you just can't fucking like,

301
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:48.620
I actually had a lot of comics,
uh,
you know,

302
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.340
I'll run into at this point because I've been doing it so long.

303
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:55.070
I'm the fucking old guy,
man.
I'm 48 now.
So like a lot,

304
00:16:55.071 --> 00:16:57.290
most of them that I talked to her at least 10 years younger than me.
Right.

305
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.390
Cause uh,
you know,
most guys my age at this point of raw,
either mogul,

306
00:17:01.391 --> 00:17:03.400
so they write and substitute teachers.
Right?
Right.

307
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.500
There's very few of us still doing comedy clubs.
So

308
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.890
they'll come up to me and I'll be like,
yeah,
you know,
I just want to see,

309
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:12.200
you know,
the other day this comic said Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

310
00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:14.120
And they said to me,
and I always want to say like,

311
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.640
why the fuck would you listen to some negative cut like that?

312
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.980
But then I always go back to like,
oh cause I did,

313
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.300
I did when I was where you're at in the fucking business soap.
Right.
Um,

314
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.780
I kinda lets,
one thing I do like about Twitter is I,
when I actually read them,

315
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:29.090
like I used to respond like sports things,

316
00:17:29.091 --> 00:17:32.690
I'll go back and forth cause that's fun.
But when there's any of that shit,

317
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:35.450
like I was offended or uh,

318
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:40.280
you know this facts checking horse shit on my fucking fact check all of that.

319
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.990
I'll either laugh or just kind of glance at it,
scroll by it or whatever.

320
00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:49.200
But like back in the day,
like that shit with like a,
that would bug me.

321
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.350
Like if somebody really came at me yet,
you still really bother me.

322
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.260
And I had to develop a whole nother like,
Oh internet,

323
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:58.380
I need to have the wall up for the Internet.
You have to.
Yeah.

324
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:02.100
Cause the first time somebody really got me was back the my space days,
you know,

325
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:02.551
and like I,

326
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:05.610
I had the wall up if I was on stage in a comedy club and now I'm just sitting at

327
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:09.990
home eating a piece of toast your guards down and somebody hit me fucking both

328
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:12.180
barrels.
Dude,
I can't even remember what the fuck they said.

329
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:16.050
But I still remember the feeling I had to go for a walk and I was with Nia
still.

330
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.220
And uh,
she said to me,
um,

331
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.350
she goes in,
she basically said,

332
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.540
you're going to let that fuck you shouldn't read those things.
Look at this,

333
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.520
this could you just let this fucking guy you don't even know,

334
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.850
just ruined like an hour your life.
And,
uh,

335
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.970
it still took me an hour to come down.
I was just like,
you know what?

336
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:36.640
You're right.
This is stupid.
So now when I read them,
uh,
I just,

337
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.830
I laughed them off.
Unless it's sports sports,
I will go back and forth on.
Yeah.
I,

338
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.580
it's a,
it's a new frontier with,
with,
with the,
with the,
with the Twitter and,
and,

339
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:48.300
and,
and you know,
if you have any sort of pump all the way with the Twitter,
no,

340
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:50.670
it's fucking crazy,
man.
You can't say Facebook.

341
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.440
Are you on the Facebook to the member of my space?
That was like 15,
16 years ago.

342
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:58.830
Right now.
I love this.
Uh,
you know,
when people book a job now,

343
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:02.790
Comedians book a job and then they jump on your Twitter and then they scroll

344
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:03.480
back.

345
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.780
Something recently got a job and they scrolled back on this person's Twitter.

346
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.030
You know,
they'd been on Twitter for like five fucking years,

347
00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:13.620
10,000 tweets to tweets.
Oh,
about about something they said bad.

348
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.010
They didn't even say it bad.
It was a joke.
Right?
It was a Joe,
right.

349
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.150
Making fun of themselves.
They take it out of contract,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

350
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.450
Bullshit.
Oh yeah.
Well yeah,
yeah.
All in those people who do it.
It's like,
Hey,

351
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.820
can I listen to your voicemails for the last month?
And I read all your texts.

352
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:30.480
We'll go through all of them shits to find and they have to read each and every

353
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:34.050
one to find one.
That's not good.
God forbid anything good.

354
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:36.390
All they're trying to do with shifts.
Cause it's just,
it's clickbait.

355
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.790
And then people will go on it and then all of a sudden like,
but I,
I,

356
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:42.540
what's the greatest?
The networks now don't seem to respond to it.
No,
they don't.

357
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:46.800
Which is great cause everybody's got some shit on there.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Mine.

358
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.960
My mind's horrendous.
My minds.

359
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.960
I think it's better to have a horrendous one rather than like butterflies and

360
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:55.140
flowers and then a couple of horrendous ones.
Right.
Then it's like what the fuck?

361
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:59.250
But if you just come in with the mean the whole time,
right then they're like,

362
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:03.450
yeah it,
there's nothing,
there's nothing new.
Like I don't think with you or me.

363
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.060
That should be your apology.
I tweet something like that every day.
Yeah.

364
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:08.280
What the fuck?
Where you bent?
Yeah.
And I don't care.

365
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.490
You're all of a sudden you're follow me.
Welcome to the fucking party.

366
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.860
So what's up?
What's up with you man?
So do you finish you,

367
00:20:14.861 --> 00:20:18.720
you finished the second season of your show?
Yup.
Done or no?

368
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.640
We finished writing it.
So now it's,

369
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.640
it's all the punch up and the editing and all that type of stuff.

370
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.240
But you didn't do the voiceovers like [inaudible] I know it's not shot cause you

371
00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:31.350
don't shoot it,
but did you record it?
Yeah.
It's all recorded.
And,
and,
and when,

372
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:34.590
when,
when is the second season of,
of,
of a coming out?

373
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.720
We're looking like may of next year.
It takes that long.
Well,

374
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.540
the thing about it was this was our first season,

375
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.180
so they had to see how we were going to do,
right.

376
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.090
So now like now that we're doing well and they're like,

377
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:50.440
and what's second season looks like?

378
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:55.360
We're already talking about the third season so they won't be as big.
Ah,
a a gap.

379
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:58.090
So it was one of the,
see I only gave me six.
Right.

380
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.320
And the reason they only gave me six I think was because when I went to pitch a

381
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:06.990
cartoon at that time,
no comedian was doing a cartoon.
Right.

382
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.620
Louie Anderson did one,
uh,
what's his face there?
Uh,
you know,

383
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.970
I'll be back to bill Cosby.
Yay.
Now.
But they all fuck every,
like,

384
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.910
it's not like Howie Mendell.
There's a bunch of people that have done like,

385
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:22.630
comedians don't just as of right now,
no one was doing one.
Right.

386
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.660
So they were expecting me I guess to come in and try to do my version of Louie

387
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:32.020
on my version of Marin and I just looked at those shows is a huge fan going,

388
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.920
I'm not going to fucking do this better than them so I'm going to be like the

389
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:38.320
third string quarterback holding the clipboard.
Right?

390
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.540
Like I'm not gonna fucking be better than Louis show and I'm not going to

391
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:44.230
fucking self examine myself.
Like tie the podcast in and all that shit.

392
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.060
Marin's already doing that.
Right.

393
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:50.350
It's just like I just felt like I didn't see any wiggle room between those two

394
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:54.610
shows.
Were those two shows like because of the success of looting,

395
00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:56.410
because it's sex success of Marin,

396
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.930
you consciously said I need to do a like a cartoon.
Like Oh,

397
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.380
I had this idea,

398
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:06.040
I had this idea way back in oh nine and I pitched it to comedy central and I

399
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:09.430
wanted to do them is five minute vignettes of just crazy shit from my childhood

400
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:15.070
and they were just like,
well you know,
so and so just did a cartoon.

401
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:15.970
It was another comedian.

402
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.120
I'm not going to say his name right and it didn't do well and I wanted to be

403
00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:19.751
like,
well,
you know,

404
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:22.330
Warner brothers did one with the bunny and that went did pretty well.

405
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.350
People don't like animation,
so they just kept getting kicked to the curb.
Um,

406
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.290
and uh,
you know,
I had a couple of one camera things.

407
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:30.880
I tried to do something with the always sunny guys,

408
00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:33.340
which I could still can't believe that one didn't get picked up and they just

409
00:22:33.341 --> 00:22:37.870
weren't getting picked up.
So I had this sort of,
this was the fun one,
right.

410
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:42.190
And I,
through Steve Byrne,
I met Vince Vaughn wild west.
They liked it.

411
00:22:42.191 --> 00:22:45.660
Then they brought on the Great Mike Price from the Simpsons and uh,
then it,

412
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.460
then we pitched it around town and everybody was looking at us like,

413
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:52.630
who are these old guys pitching this fucking cartoon from the early Seventies.

414
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.880
Right,
right.
Then we went to adult swim was fucking hilarious.

415
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:56.050
Like the guy we were pitching too.

416
00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:58.930
We were all at least like 15 to 20 years older than 10.
10.

417
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:03.560
The guy that was alive in 1972 you have a tight purple shirt on or a pink?
No,

418
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.040
he was a cool guy.
He was a cool guy.
He was just a young guy.

419
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:06.821
So it's just kind of like,

420
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:09.610
it would be like if me and the eighties or early nineties,

421
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:13.300
if someone came in who said,
okay,
the show takes place in 1961.

422
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.290
Do you remember when Blah Blah Blah.

423
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.690
We were talking about that when they used to spray for mosquitoes and all that

424
00:23:17.691 --> 00:23:18.400
and this,

425
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.520
which is funny now that's coming back with the whatever that fucking virus is.

426
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:25.190
It Equiline known that equal.
I uh,
let's your Breton to Zeke,
you,

427
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.640
what is it called?
Zika.
Zika.
Ezekiel Elliott.
Zika.
Zika,

428
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:35.680
jumbo.
Elliot.
Um,
anyways,
so uh,
yeah,

429
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:39.130
so just kind of came bawling get,
so then nobody picked it up.

430
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:42.730
And then Vince was the guy who said,
well,
let's just go on Netflix too.

431
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:45.230
He was in the pitch meetings.
That's cool.
We'll do.

432
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.320
That's why it got sold because then I just went over to Netflix.
So good.

433
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.900
I'm a fucking no name comic.
Want to do a [inaudible] too?
And they'd be like,

434
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:54.680
yeah,
that's cool.
But I think they were thinking go fuck yourself.

435
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:57.350
And then they look to the left and like that's an alias movie star and he

436
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:01.050
believes in this.
So then I think they were just like,
we'll give you six,
right?

437
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.670
We'll give you six.
We see how they do.
And then fortunately for us,

438
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.800
while we were doing that,
bojack horseman came out and it blew up.

439
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.450
Right.
That one's right.
Oh,
it's doing great.
So show is that um,

440
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.600
that's Aaron Paul.
Oh,
right,
right,
right,
right.

441
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.020
I met the guy the other day and one of those things,
a great guy too.

442
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.580
My apologies.
So many fucking people in this business for so many fucking people.

443
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.360
They uh,
I loved.
You know what?

444
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:29.600
My favorite part of bojack horseman is just so fucking nuts.
I love his house.

445
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.190
I haven't seen his house as the shit is it?
It's Keith got the view.

446
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.960
He's got the fucking pool.

447
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.830
I got to watch it sits like I let every time I watch that show,

448
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:41.930
as much as I love all the shit they do it,
he was like,
you know,

449
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.080
former sitcoms star,
you know,
he,

450
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.100
he did like a too close for comfort kind of show and he's past his fucking
prime.

451
00:24:49.101 --> 00:24:52.650
He's trying to get his career going again.
He does coke and like buddy,

452
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.540
I what I love is he has no shame.
And this is the animated.
Yeah.

453
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.500
What I love is he watches old episodes of his show and has no shame.
Right.

454
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:03.800
And it looks at them how great they are.
Right.
Ain't,
and he just goes around.

455
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.720
That's fucking funny.
Yeah.
And like you,

456
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:08.210
you see like some sometimes like he'll go out until like a restaurant or

457
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:09.290
something,
a Hollywood restaurant.

458
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.060
You're kind of like all that kind of seems like that place.

459
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.120
Like you know those old referencing places.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's cool.

460
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:16.580
But do you watch it?
Cause they have it in the opening,

461
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.640
the opening credits of the shit and I fucking love his house.

462
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.050
I got to check that show out.

463
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.340
If bojack's horse horseman's house went up for sale,
I would definitely,

464
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:28.750
I would go to the open house,
the act,
you know what I mean?
And Bullshit.

465
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.030
Like he could afford it.
How many,
how many,
how many,
uh,
uh,

466
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:35.000
episodes you do doing in the second season?
Two.
You did 10.

467
00:25:35.001 --> 00:25:39.200
And then what about third season?
10.
10.
Is it a fucking grind to do this shit?

468
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.520
Um,
yeah,
sometimes it is.
It's,
it's more like,
uh,

469
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.460
it's,
it's uh,
it's one of those things when it's,
when it's going good,

470
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.300
right?
It's,
it seems like easy now.
Some of the most fun,

471
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:56.150
like we're in the writer's room and somebody comes up with something cool and

472
00:25:56.151 --> 00:25:59.570
everybody's pitching on it.
We're all laughing our ass off and you know,

473
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:02.840
it's Netflix,
so it's not like you got to worry,
you just go ahead and put it in.

474
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.600
But um,
when,
when it's not working and all that,

475
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.310
all those industry words start coming out.

476
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.540
This isn't tracking and I think we earned this,
right.
This isn't our show,
right.

477
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.030
This is in the tones in our,
in our Palette.
Right.
And all of that shit.

478
00:26:20.031 --> 00:26:23.000
When that starts coming out and then it's,
it's already like fucking,
you know,

479
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.050
late in the day and you're going to stay late and then spitting and then you're

480
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:31.460
gonna come back.
I'll tell you one thing I've really,
I always had respectful,

481
00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:35.880
but I really have way,
way,
way more respect now for is uh,

482
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.170
like nobody works harder than you show runners probably work the hardest.

483
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.800
And then writers.
Yeah.
And to listen to,
to writers,
man,

484
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:47.700
they fucking tell these horror stories like,
of,
of like Comedians,

485
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:51.030
all you tell the stories,
the story,
Shabaab,
they tell the stories.
It's like,
dude,

486
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:56.031
when you get a showrunner who's unhappily married or just doesn't like his or

487
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:58.950
her life,
it's just like you're never going home cause they're on top.

488
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.630
They don't want to leave.
They don't want to leave.

489
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.680
They're waiting for their wife on the show runner to go to sleep boss.
Yeah.

490
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.130
And they'll just keep going over it and over it and they'll come up with shit to

491
00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:10.600
do,
do.
And these fucking people will stay there till two in the morning.
They,

492
00:27:10.601 --> 00:27:13.790
they're literally like Iceland and this guy a long time ago.
And uh,

493
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.220
he was unhappily married and he used to tell this hilarious story how he would

494
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:20.850
go out drinking and then he would drive past his house and if the light was

495
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:21.750
still on,
you would keep

496
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.170
<v 0>driving.
Fuck
that.
Christ,</v>

497
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.800
I was already afraid enough.
There was Anthony [inaudible]

498
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.350
<v 1>told that story.
I was already afraid,
afraid enough to get married.</v>

499
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:38.070
And then he told that story and I don't know what it was.
It was so vivid.

500
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.061
For some reason,

501
00:27:39.061 --> 00:27:42.030
I pictured one of the houses that I grew up in whenever I pictured him telling

502
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:42.690
that story,

503
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.020
it's me and I'm driving by looking at what was the family room living,

504
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:48.600
a silhouette of them waking.
Yeah.
Just like,

505
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.320
<v 0>you know,
as,
that's one of those things where he's just like,
Jesus Christ.</v>

506
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.890
At some point you gotta be,
and he'd be like a beer.
Fuck it.

507
00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:00.330
When I had my first son,
I was so sleep deprived.

508
00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:03.240
I would leave the house to sleep in my car on the street.

509
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.680
Like I had parked my car in a shady thing and I had a big navigator and I

510
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:10.770
literally would like,
I'd have like a little pillow or like a sweatshirt.

511
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.860
And how would you just tell your wife he had somewhere and I got shit to do.

512
00:28:13.861 --> 00:28:16.830
I got a meeting or whatever and I probably most likely would,

513
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.880
but then I would fucking,
or I leave three hours early or late,
you know,

514
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.910
like my meeting will be a 10 and they would come home just to sleep in the car.

515
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.080
Cause I was the first kid I had yo,
I was,

516
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.990
I couldn't see straight.
You know,
it's like,
it's like,
um,

517
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.640
<v 1>are you,</v>

518
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.230
are you one of those guys that doesn't do well unless he gets eight hours?

519
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.000
<v 0>Well I'm better now because having kids will break you from whatever habits you</v>

520
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:40.730
think you have as far as sleep.

521
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.550
You will be broken like where you think you need eight hours.
You know,

522
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:48.550
like now the kids,
kids are older so they sleep like teenagers.
So,
but when the,

523
00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:53.190
when they were younger that that,
that first year,
year and a half,
two years,

524
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.400
Yo,
it's,
it's like a shock to the system for real.

525
00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.680
And especially if you have a kid that's not a big like a sleep,

526
00:28:58.681 --> 00:29:01.410
especially if you're in this business too.
We have,
you know,
you,
you have,

527
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.390
you know what's weird,
like the amount of free time we have,

528
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:06.570
but so much of that is like panic of when am I going to get the next thing.

529
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.720
So it's not an enjoyable,
no,
it's not enjoyable at all.

530
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.980
They put the you do nothing.
I go,

531
00:29:10.981 --> 00:29:14.910
I'm fucking walking around worried like you see me out and you think I'm doing

532
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:15.211
nothing.

533
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:18.870
All I'm doing is like trying to find like make sure I'm near a bathroom so I

534
00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:22.080
don't,
you know,
like shit myself and like waiting for the phone ring.

535
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.080
I know that's what some guy said that a long time ago.
Send anybody in.

536
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:29.190
This business is a professional job hunter.
It's just like you're never,

537
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.970
you never,
you never can be like,
you can never rest easy.

538
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.550
I don't think I've ever met anybody that said,
you know what,

539
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:40.200
I've made it Leonardo.
He,
he,
he's good.
When you'd say it's money,

540
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:44.770
it's all money.
Never got married.
He never,
he's the pain in terms of like,

541
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.750
you know,
man Shit,
never got married,
does his shit.
He's the Jeter.

542
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:53.330
He's the GM of,
of of actors period.
And,

543
00:29:53.331 --> 00:29:58.331
and also you'd be hard pressed to find anybody that has anything bad to say

544
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:02.680
about them.
Like when Derek Jeter.
Yeah.
Well you know,
like when you go with set,

545
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:07.060
you work with like,
and he's working on big movies like,
you know,
20,
30 movies,

546
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:09.910
however men and movie.
So it's like hundreds of people that he's come across.

547
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.490
And then there's fans and then there's the hundreds of women.

548
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.640
You don't hear anybody going that cock sucker this or he worked with me on this,

549
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.470
did just now he,
he's cool now,
but he knows how to,
he knows how to handle,

550
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:24.910
I met him one time,
right.
He's chill.
This is the funniest shit ever.
You know,

551
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:28.150
he's standing there.
Of course everyone wants to talk to him,
and the guy was,

552
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:29.530
what's it goes,
hey,
you want to meet the guy?
He's like,

553
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:31.090
I don't want to bug him like it's not going in and meet him.

554
00:30:31.091 --> 00:30:34.460
So I fucking go over there.
And he goes,
Hey Leo,
this is a,

555
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.800
this is bill [inaudible].
He's a standup comedian.
And they just,
he just nodded.

556
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:42.010
He goes,
he goes,
what did he say?
He goes,
ah.
He goes,
I'm familiar with this work.

557
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.160
Or he goes,
all right,
I've seen his work and just nodded like that.

558
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.980
It was perfect.
He knows saying no,
he didn't say it was good.

559
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.760
He didn't say it was bad and I could totally tell by the way he said that was

560
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:54.820
just,
I don't need another freckle jackass trying to say hello to me.

561
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.970
And I just went like,
oh,
hey,
Matt.
And I just walked away and I was just like,

562
00:30:57.971 --> 00:31:02.080
he handled that perfectly perfect.
Okay.
Can you imagine?
I've seen his work,

563
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.010
that's it.
And he may or may not have seen the work.
You never know,
but,

564
00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.370
but you walk away,
go.
You walk away feeling good about it.

565
00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:11.440
The best rap it upskills that was on a whole other level because I walked away,

566
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:13.160
I felt good.
I met the guy,
right.

567
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.960
We had zero conversation of that just sort of way.
But it's a memorable thing.

568
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.380
Yes.
That's some,
that's some high level shits,

569
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.110
ninth degree black belt public figure read.

570
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.680
That's like some presidential like you know like running countries,

571
00:31:25.681 --> 00:31:28.540
shit like sweats.
That martial art where they use,

572
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:32.530
she know a Kito where they'll use your energy and next thing you know like you

573
00:31:32.531 --> 00:31:36.130
went to kick him and then the the four she used to kick the person.

574
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:37.240
You go flying into the wall.

575
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:39.730
That's what he did that did the make use it all against you.

576
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:43.870
I'm familiar with this work is not it gracious with eye contact.

577
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.470
The Blue Eyes would dig.
He gave me a quick eye contact.
You still don't know.

578
00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:50.380
You're still trying to,
I don't remember.
I imagine that on a girl,

579
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.800
like you're just all fucked up in the game.
That sort of like elegance.

580
00:31:53.801 --> 00:31:58.140
You don't know.
Like he liked les.
That's just like,
it's just soda.
Elegant.

581
00:31:58.141 --> 00:32:00.580
So that I don't think that word has ever been used in this plug.
No.

582
00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:03.360
Thank you for bringing that.
And especially the DiCaprio has that shit.

583
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.320
I mean in like,
you know,
you think about like,

584
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.860
you know the amount of people that he comes across on a daily basis.

585
00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:12.550
Just think of like he's in New York.
Just think about Leonardo on a,
on a,
on a,

586
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:16.870
on a,
on a fall day in New York.
Like I picture his life grand central station,

587
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.940
five o'clock in the afternoon,

588
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:22.720
you're late for a train and everybody in there no shoe and wants to say hello

589
00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:26.020
and you got to get from the door to and make the fucking train.

590
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.870
That has started to out.
He's not going to make it.
He could make it,

591
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.040
he can make it cause he's got it figured out.
He,

592
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.850
he would do and everyone would feel good and they would part and he would just

593
00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:37.170
go right through.
What's the elegance?
Elegance of Leonardo Dicaprio?

594
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.770
That should be,
that should be his autobiography.

595
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.520
The unauthorized autobiography though.
But he couldn't,

596
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:46.490
he couldn't divulge your secrets and not everybody would know what the fuck he

597
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:50.130
was doing.
But what you said about the Aquillo's fucking totally right.

598
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.050
I came home and told my wife that I was,
it wasn't even like I was,

599
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.980
the excitement of meeting him was out shined by how he handled me.

600
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.830
It was fucking perfect.
That's like some Obama Shit.

601
00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:03.380
Like that's presidential shit.
You know what I mean?

602
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.880
Cause people are like to like bugging,

603
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:09.050
you know I saw him and we blew me off and I was so fine with it.
It was awesome.

604
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.470
It was,
it was perfect.
It was fun.
It was a work of art.
You don't,

605
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.440
Leonardo is elegant.
I Dunno.

606
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:20.270
Maybe Game Tom Brady.
He's a good looking fella.
Tom.
No tights.

607
00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:25.490
Who,
how do we get on fucking Leonardo Dicaprio?
I don't even know.

608
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.470
We were talking about job hundreds,
right?
Job Hunters.
Oh,

609
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.480
having it all figured out,
but you can't go back information ever making it.

610
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.450
Once you go backwards,
then that just becomes radio silence.
No.

611
00:33:35.451 --> 00:33:37.670
The people who are going to be good,
they're hanging on the edge of the seat.

612
00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:38.600
They want to see,
you know,

613
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:41.930
like I think a lot of them are laying down right now maybe driving.
What do you,

614
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:45.060
what do people do like with listening to majority of the podcast listeners of

615
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.990
the flight per airplane flights going to the gym,

616
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.250
going for a run in the car,
sit on the train.
A lot of commuters.
Yes.

617
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.100
So then be end up making them laugh and then people look at and like they're

618
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:57.740
fucking idiots.
I get a lot of,
I get a lot of tweets like that.

619
00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:01.130
I was on the train laughing crazy.
Hysterical when you,
when you said this,

620
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:04.310
this and this or whatever.
Yeah.
That always makes,
I always makes me feel good.

621
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.370
How long have you been doing this?
June podcasting,

622
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.550
June or July of 2007 I'll say this again.

623
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:15.380
Bill Burr inspired me to do my own pop podcast cause the first time I went on

624
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:18.140
your podcast,
the first time when we make podcast history,

625
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.460
I had never been on a podcast and I was like,
what the fuck is you?

626
00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.750
Did you have an inferiority complex?
No,
I didn't even know.

627
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.700
It was sort of just sort of,
it was just sort of brewing and and,
and,

628
00:34:28.701 --> 00:34:31.090
and doing it.
So you're a man who has a lot of things to say,
man,

629
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.100
how the fuck did you get into the whole real housewives and then get onto,

630
00:34:35.101 --> 00:34:36.230
it was the Andy Cohen show.

631
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:41.150
I'm with Andy Cohen show that is the Sports Center Sports Center for women.

632
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.140
Yes.
For and Ken and gay men and me,
and I have to say this,

633
00:34:45.141 --> 00:34:48.710
it's one of the brilliance of that show brilliance.
I'll tell you what it is,

634
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:53.740
is how of Koan or the housewives in general of him doing the show because all he

635
00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:58.370
has to do is just stir it up a little bit and then sit back and they're going to

636
00:34:58.371 --> 00:35:02.960
fill out all,
he just goes.
He'll just be like,
so Mandy,
in episode two,

637
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.780
yes,
you were going through this,
this and this.

638
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:10.580
And then Karen said that the reason you can't get a man is because,

639
00:35:10.581 --> 00:35:13.150
and then he just fucking sits back and they go out.

640
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.120
And it's the most brilliant show I've seen since when Byron Allen used to do,
uh,

641
00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.630
comics unleashed.
Oh Huh.
And this is the brilliance he produced.
Not,

642
00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:23.480
that's incredible.
Now he produced the show,
right?
It was,

643
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:25.910
he owned the fucking show and syndicated it.
Okay.

644
00:35:25.911 --> 00:35:28.730
He doesn't have to have any writers because comedians would come in with their

645
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:31.070
own bits and then he knew what bits you were doing.

646
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:35.950
So all he had to do is just sit there and be like,
uhh.
So Michael,
ah,
ah,

647
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.420
have you ever been to a Knicks game?
And then you just go,
as a matter of fact,

648
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:41.370
I have,
and you just go full,
go into your bit.

649
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:46.080
And then he just sits back as you eat up that fucking time with your own fucking

650
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:49.860
comedy.
And then he would go over there.
So Judy,
uh,

651
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:52.800
you're counting the money in his hand and bloody fucking brilliant.

652
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.790
That guy is the king of finding the show where no one sees the shelf,
but they,

653
00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:57.740
but it stays on the,

654
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.890
I remember them coming up next week coming up now he took press junkets.
Yup.

655
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.010
It was like this is a fucking show.
And he was like,
before Tmz,

656
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:08.100
he was doing that shit and it was going,
I'll bet you Byron Allen,

657
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.440
have you ever been interviewed him?
No.
I've met him a few times,

658
00:36:10.441 --> 00:36:14.610
but that guy is a fucking genius and he has like three quarters Oprah money and

659
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:15.320
nobody even knows.

660
00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.750
So I was just going to say that mother fucker's price so fucking we made it.

661
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.810
Absolutely made it.
He's probably like you,
you like,

662
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:25.050
you think I'm a fucking joke and yeah,
that motherfucker was doing that.

663
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.010
Owning and ownership.
Any indication he came in on,
uh,
on,
that's incredible.

664
00:36:30.011 --> 00:36:33.620
That's incredible.
He was not even the star.
He was like the fuels 19.
Yeah,

665
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.610
like the fourth banana.
He,
he,
he was a kid.

666
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:39.550
He was like straight out the fucking business.
Yes.
Yeah.
I like all of those.
Yeah,

667
00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.520
I think he's good.
Um,
oh,
so the was he's not getting 1 cent residual check.
Nah,

668
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.090
he ain't getting them shit.
I just got one the other day for 47 cents.

669
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.700
We have this,
this game,
uh,
you meet Al Madrigal sends it to me.

670
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:56.700
So it's almost like a game of poker where you just take a picture of your

671
00:36:56.701 --> 00:36:59.320
residual check to going all the way down.
You,

672
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.240
you and Al Madrigal the two people I know that actually got literally got a 1

673
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.700
cent 1 cent residual from,
I don't even know what it was,

674
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.290
but I cashed the shit they used to.
They used to be.
I did.
Fuck that.
I was like,

675
00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:13.950
I thought I did something that I now either liked or didn't like to get this one

676
00:37:13.951 --> 00:37:18.420
sense and it's never coming in.
This is the bottom,
this residual,
this cycle.

677
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.260
However those things get get to you.
I never understand how they get to,

678
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:26.430
but this whole he said,
oh it gets to is is the money all goes to somebody else.

679
00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:29.730
And then they had this algorithm on how it works off the first time they pay you

680
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:33.720
the second time it's half that and then it's you're just complete thousand feet

681
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:36.980
of water and then at one sense will come in and the partners allows and dollar

682
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.500
gig.
Then you get a residual for six 66 something like that.

683
00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:42.660
And then three 32 no,
no,
no.

684
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.280
It goes six 66 down to like $3 and 32 so it wasn't that big of a jump.

685
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.090
I feel it does.
I don't know.
I eat cause that whatever,
that's not the point.

686
00:37:51.091 --> 00:37:55.350
The point is about how's,
well this is how I got into housewives.
My girl,

687
00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.650
Yeah Lady,
my lady,
she,
she,

688
00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:03.000
she would watch housewives on Sundays and a few seasons ago,

689
00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:06.390
I don't remember what happened.
A few seasons go Sunday during football season,

690
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.560
something went bad for me.
So normally I'd be downstairs watching the late game,

691
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.830
the,
the,
the Sunday night football game.
And by the time I got up there,
the,

692
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.370
the,
the housewives shit would be over.

693
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.780
So what something happened where something happened with my team or the game,

694
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:24.090
it's something was bad and a mother fuck this game.

695
00:38:24.091 --> 00:38:27.270
And I went upstairs early and I,
and I was like,
you know,
she's like,

696
00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.560
what the fuck are you doing up here?
I was like,
oh,

697
00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:30.120
she's well don't come up here with your bullshit.

698
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.400
I don't want to watch a fucking game.
I'll watch this shit with you.

699
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.210
And I swear to God,
Bill,
I don't know if you watch housewives or not,

700
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.740
but I was like first of all,
as an actor,
and I'm not like,
oh it's an actor,

701
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:45.250
I'm a people watcher.
But I was like so fascinated by the behavior.
I was like,

702
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.640
Yo you,
you every actor should be watching this.

703
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.690
Every actress should hundred and 50% be watching because it's mainly women.

704
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.800
But I was just fascinated that these people are for real.

705
00:38:56.801 --> 00:39:00.220
They have cameras on them and you know,
people think it's fake.
You.

706
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.480
Marlon Brando on his best day.
Meryl Streep on his best day,

707
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:07.060
couldn't do some of the shit that I see on these housewives show.

708
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.930
So I just fell in love with,
I was just like,
Yo,
this is fucking nuts.

709
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:13.510
And I was like,
who's this one?
She was telling me all the stories and I was like,

710
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:18.050
this is fucking crazy and no bullshit.
I will put the shit up against it.

711
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.851
What is the name of the show?

712
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:22.720
You just submit the Aaron Paul show bojack horseman.
Bojack horseman,

713
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:27.490
which sounds dope.
Fucking breaking bad.
Bill burr was on breaking bad,
Blah Blah.

714
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.470
I swear on my,
on my kid's feet,
that a great episode of real housewives.

715
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.620
I will put it up there with the best of the Sopranos.
I'm not saying it's better,

716
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:39.940
but as far as the entertainment value of a great episodes of real housewives to

717
00:39:39.941 --> 00:39:42.400
same fucking thing.
Nobody and you're looking at me like,
no,

718
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.360
I understand if you're looking at it as far as like ideas for characters just

719
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:49.700
entertained,
pure entertainment,
pure entertainment.

720
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.340
I saw a long time ago on on one of those bounty hunter shows,
right?

721
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:57.610
This guy did the greatest delivery of this,
of the,

722
00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:02.590
of a line where he,
he,
his wife came running up to him.

723
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:04.990
Excuse accusing of him of something.

724
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.170
So he started off going like I wasn't,

725
00:40:08.171 --> 00:40:11.320
and then he got mad and said I wasn't again.
And then he was like,

726
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.660
then he immediately hit,
did the math in his head like,
don't get mad.

727
00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.150
So he wouldn't like that.
She came out like,
what the fuck are you blah blah.

728
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.250
And he goes,
he goes,
I wasn't,
I wasn't,
I wasn't he,

729
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.630
he did every fucking thing you can't.
And I was just,

730
00:40:22.631 --> 00:40:26.590
and I remember watching that,
I did say to Nia,
I was like,
dude,

731
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:30.930
if any actor ever did that with the academy awards on a,
on a page,
what you're,

732
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.660
you're working for another 20 years.
That's it.
You're,
you're great.
So,

733
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.250
so it's not like I sit there and watch it as it,

734
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:39.520
as an actor sound like I'm studying it,
but that's what I was like,
Yo,

735
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:41.410
this is fucking wild.
Like,
Yo this.

736
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.440
And I was like asking her questions and I was like,
this is how they act.

737
00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:47.140
This is for real.
She goes,
yeah,
this is fruit.
This one's that one.
It was like,

738
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.130
they're dead series arguing like they're crying.
I was like,
people can't do that.

739
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.910
Fucking Meryl Streep can't cry like a lunatic whenever she wants aren't.

740
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:57.940
She was on her best day.
She couldn't do that check,
so I just,

741
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:02.020
I fell in love with it and believe me,
I sit there and watch it.

742
00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.340
Shame with shame,

743
00:41:03.341 --> 00:41:07.720
but I also know that this is as good as TV on any channel.
I'm telling you,

744
00:41:07.721 --> 00:41:08.554
I put,

745
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:14.110
I am telling you in terms of what you get in terms of like when you watch a

746
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:17.050
great episode of whatever show you're into it,
it doesn't matter.

747
00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:20.470
Whenever show people have an affection for,
it can be CSI la.

748
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.220
When you turn off the channel,
when you turn the show off,
when it ends,

749
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.720
literally you're looking at me like I'm nuts.
You're when,
when,
when,
when,

750
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.800
when a good episode of real housewives ends,
we clap at the fucking TV.
I'm like,

751
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.170
I'm in a fucking Broadway show.
You lost me there.
I,

752
00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.500
I'm with you with the character stuff and the crying and all that shit.
But like,

753
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:41.570
you know,
if you can just fucking sit there and act like,
you know,

754
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.950
I'm telling you then an episode of the Sopranos,
I'm not saying it's better,

755
00:41:45.951 --> 00:41:49.510
I'm saying it gives you entertainment,
entertainment,
value fan on.

756
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.360
I get depressed when I watch it and I come home and I feel like I fucking live

757
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:55.580
with them after a while and then never in a good mood.

758
00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.680
And all they do is scream and yell at each other.

759
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:58.730
And I have no problem with this.

760
00:41:58.731 --> 00:42:01.670
My mind is much screaming and yelling at each other here.
Yeah,
but it's,

761
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:04.370
but w we're having fun though.
That's true.

762
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.730
And I'm not saying hurtful shit.
Right.

763
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.390
I'm not saying like this really hurtful shit to you that I,
that I mean,
right,

764
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.020
right.
You know,
and then we have like this big fucking falling out and like,

765
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:17.150
and I'd walk off the set and then like,
you know,

766
00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:19.910
someone subs who do really good new,
I'm not going to record anymore with bill.

767
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.750
He said about me.
No,
I'm just saying,

768
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.120
but like what kills me was my wife is a feminist.
Does she love it?
Yes.

769
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.983
And it just like,

770
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.160
I go like this shows women in such a bad light that all they want to do is go

771
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:36.161
around and get these fucking stupid ass shoes and I just scream and yell at each

772
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:38.570
other.
But she goes,
look,
I just watch it.

773
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.390
Cause sometimes I don't feel like thinking because she also,

774
00:42:41.391 --> 00:42:45.260
we'll watch some other shit.
But she mainly watches that stuff.

775
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.440
And she's not telling you the truth about the thinking.
She's engaged.
She's,

776
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.190
she's thinking what she's watching.
I can't read your wife's mind,

777
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.910
but I want tell you the,
I know it.
I've had conversations with the wife about it.

778
00:42:55.911 --> 00:42:59.600
I've had conversations,
we've discussed it.
She loves it.
Like I,
you know,
I hit,

779
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:02.300
you know,
it makes me sad is,

780
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.470
is watching these women in their forties and 50s trying to dress.
That's crazy.

781
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:12.630
Two,
it's like you look at it,
they're exhausted.
Yes,
yes.

782
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.210
Like you're an ebony used the word gear and your elegant years.
Yes,
I agree.

783
00:43:16.211 --> 00:43:21.020
Like there's a guy,
I'm in my sport coat years.
I agree.
I hear no more tank tops.

784
00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:21.380
For me.

785
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.760
I hear some cleaning out the garage and I know no one in the general public is

786
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:29.450
going to see my fucking flabby ghost white arm.
I hear you.
I hear you.

787
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.480
But like watching them that it'll wire and forever 21 I don't like that shit

788
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:35.410
cause so many of them.

789
00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.380
They really like the attractive I what the Botox who fucking done up?

790
00:43:39.381 --> 00:43:43.430
It's like the Oscars on a Tuesday for coffee.
Oh yeah,
it's insane.

791
00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.220
And then the one with the little fucking plugged nose she's out of which one are

792
00:43:46.221 --> 00:43:47.030
you drunk?

793
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.280
I don't even know what you don't even know what show are you even talking like

794
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:52.160
you don't even know what this one,
there's one where the pug nose on every show.

795
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.380
No,
it's like a,
it looks literally,
it looks like,

796
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.700
you know back when you had a train set and there was a tunnel and the tunnel
out.

797
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:01.910
That's what a nose looks like.
A goal.
I'm upside down you and the whole thing,

798
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.690
they can see both sides.
Yeah.
And she won't name names cause we would all like,

799
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:06.620
you know,
but then you,

800
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:11.060
you fucking watch it and like this screaming and yelling at each other.
I get it.

801
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:15.160
The only time I'll I'll get into it is the Jersey one I liked because the guys

802
00:44:15.161 --> 00:44:17.480
are funny.
Yeah,
they're good.
The core gun,

803
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.290
I falsified some loans watching them.

804
00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:26.530
Gee I guess I need to look at the papers more like that type of sociopathic

805
00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:31.350
behavior where it's like,
it's like,
dude,
you're,
you're busted out in the open.

806
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:33.310
They all know that you did it.
Yes but,

807
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.540
but the physical rounds sign in Shit and you don't know what it is you're

808
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:38.160
talking about real housewives of New Jersey.

809
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.290
But the thing for me when I keep watching,

810
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.160
they went to jail and then the reality like you see like this family,

811
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.000
like I'm saying as far as,
I hate to say entertainment,
but that's what it is.

812
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:51.420
Like you follow the story like it's fucking Dallas or knots landing.
Once,

813
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:53.700
once that kids would cry and that the dad was going,

814
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:55.590
I couldn't watch it anymore because it was too painful.

815
00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.590
I don't want to see that shit cause it,
it hit the heart.
Right.

816
00:44:58.591 --> 00:45:00.130
But you see what I'm saying?
If you're watching it.

817
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.690
But there's also that other element of like,
why the fuck are you airing this?

818
00:45:03.691 --> 00:45:07.380
Why didn't you just,
I hear you have to show,
why would you put your kids on TV?

819
00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.980
I don't have the choice.
I get it.
I get it.
But,

820
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:14.670
but I am all in straight up.
Do you watch the Kardashians?

821
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.060
My not,
not as,
not as religious as my girl watches it.
So we,

822
00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:22.410
I watch it but it's not like I have to watch it.
That was the worst.

823
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:27.060
That's a fucking cause they don't have any problems.
No.
And they just keep going.

824
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:27.570
Problem is,

825
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:32.570
as I left my fucking $30,000 bag and the other generally $30,000 back,

826
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:34.320
how am I going to get that over here?

827
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.350
And now they throw the brother on there and the brother who I've met,

828
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:38.870
I've come across him and like,
you know,

829
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.140
like celebrities should in basketball game here for your famous guy,
man.
Yeah.

830
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.890
So I know Rob Kardashian,
you know like I know people like that.
Rob Kardashian,

831
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.550
I'd never,
you had all the big Hollywood party but he's on his show now and I'm,

832
00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:52.230
I'm thinking like,
Yo,
he's,
he's a fragile dude.

833
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.230
Like that dude does not look like he should be on a reality,
a reality show.

834
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:57.480
And they're like,
just keep going and you,
Yo,
you're like,

835
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.570
this dude's shouldn't be on a reality and look what they did to poor fucking

836
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:04.380
Lamar Odom.
They fucking put him down into the ground.

837
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.680
Who did fucking,
she was,
he was,
he was married to,
what's the name?

838
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:10.010
And like every guy that they come across,
if they don't fuck with it,

839
00:46:10.011 --> 00:46:12.960
it's like they get a curse on them.
The other one,
Scott Disick,

840
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.870
you watch your shows?
No,
you don't want them at all.
This neo watching.

841
00:46:16.871 --> 00:46:19.530
Why am I doing a pocket?
I should be doing this.
This is funny to me.

842
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.280
This is getting it out here to fuck.
I want to find something.

843
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.570
It's like after football sports it's like I want to have somebody to talk to,

844
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:32.010
but I like the shows.
But my,
the housewives or my shit.
And it's fascinating.

845
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.930
I know,
trust me,
Bill,

846
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.350
I'm not a lot of actors also like they feel guilty when they watch them cause

847
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:39.600
they feel like,
oh,
these should be scripted shows and,
and I'm,

848
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:42.390
I'm contributing to this.
But I don't think that's a problem at this point.

849
00:46:42.391 --> 00:46:45.030
There's enough fucking scripted shows for everybody to have a job.
I agree.

850
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:48.150
I agree.
I,
I,
you know,
at first I resent the reality shows,
but now I think,

851
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:49.830
you know,
they're,
they're finding,
I think,
well,
let,
let's,

852
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:52.980
let's get it back on track.
The Patriots are playing the buffalo bills next week.

853
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:58.030
Now,
Julian Edelman,
uh,
this,
this,
this,
this,
they can't that,

854
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.960
you know,
uh,
Garappolo might come back.
Yeah,
he might be back.

855
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.830
Did you see what the Patriots and other teams are doing it too?

856
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.770
But of course they just bring up the Patriots.
It's not cheating,

857
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:10.110
but it's fucking brilliant.
Well,
what are they doing?

858
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.510
Why did you preface it by saying it's not cheating?

859
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:15.960
I didn't say it was because they present it like it was.
Okay.
What was it?

860
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:20.100
So this,
this new rule that when you,
when you kick the ball out,

861
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.710
you kicked the ball and the ends off the guy catches the ball.

862
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.310
If he takes a knee rather than going to the 20 all these years,

863
00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:31.000
now it goes to the 25 so they gave him that extra five yards because they're

864
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:33.430
trying to avoid the collisions.
Yes.

865
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.610
So you just giving them the fucking 25 yard line,

866
00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.880
which is a fucking it that is a,

867
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.710
that is a fucking like what would you say are on,

868
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.010
are on a grade like a B plus return?

869
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.600
A minus year I get a return is 25 yard line.

870
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.570
If you kick in the end zone and you add the guide downs,
it,

871
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.720
it's the 25 yard line.
I didn't fucking know.
It's a new rule.

872
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.720
That's a new rule this season.
Yup.
So this is the thing,

873
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:01.990
if you take a fucking personal,
cause I that's what I was saying,
cause this guy,

874
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:06.910
I finally looked it up because I saw somebody take a personal foul on the other

875
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:10.930
team and it's like that's a 15 yard penalty.
First down.
I'm like,
all right,

876
00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:15.190
there on the 35 and they went on the 40 and I was like,
aw,
here's,

877
00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:16.780
it's so what the Patriots are doing.

878
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.620
It's like uncertain situations that they,
they,

879
00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.270
they just booted up in the air.
So it lands on like the half yard line,

880
00:48:25.271 --> 00:48:26.110
the three yard line,

881
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:29.410
or just into the end zone to entice these people to run it out.
Right.

882
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:33.820
So they can stop them before the 25 and we got to fumbles doing that against the

883
00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:34.600
Texas.
Right.

884
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:39.580
And it's just one of those fucking things where it's just like Bella check was

885
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:42.820
like,
okay,
that's the fucking rule.
Where can we get our advantage?

886
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:46.630
And it's one of those smart dog.
Exactly.
And that's half of the Shit,
you know,

887
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:49.960
I talk to people,
Hey,
he's the motherfucker,
man.
He is.
And you know,

888
00:48:49.961 --> 00:48:52.790
I'll be honest with you,
I,
you know,
like,
cause you think that I,

889
00:48:52.791 --> 00:48:55.090
I don't want to see them do good.
No bullshit.

890
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:59.800
I would love just to see just for the,
at the accomplishment of it,
if,

891
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:04.340
if,
if,
if Edelman doesn't mean,
if that'll make does play,
let's say,
uh,
um,

892
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:09.700
preset that preset and Garappolo can't play and fucking Julian Addleman plays

893
00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:16.030
quarterback and they somehow when an NFL football game,

894
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:19.800
they should just stop playing the game like this season because to me that will,

895
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:23.320
let's not get crazy.
I mean we,
we haven't played like the greatest teams.

896
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.500
It doesn't matter if you could win a football game with Julian Edelman is your

897
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:30.130
starting quarterback.
I don't give a fuck who you're playing for real.
And that's,

898
00:49:30.131 --> 00:49:30.431
that's,

899
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:34.300
that's an exaggeration with one week preparation that Julian Edelman to be,

900
00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:37.540
I mean he's not even that,
that would be crazy first of all,

901
00:49:37.541 --> 00:49:40.540
but it wouldn't you and playing buffalo.
Right.
Would you agree though?
Yeah.

902
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:42.890
That's going to be at the toughest game because in Buffalo,

903
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:45.430
because Rex Ryan is a,
he's a great coach and he's smart.

904
00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:46.840
Two aunts of mine and he,

905
00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:51.790
and he has a heart on force and his lifetime record against Bella check is,

906
00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:55.470
I think it's maybe a couple games under 500 seats.

907
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.800
It personal jet.
Yeah.
Every year we fucking went,

908
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:01.630
it was like we won and they won.

909
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.510
They won one and now he's got his brother there and they're,
you know,

910
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:07.630
they're smoking fucking weed because the brother,
it's rex.

911
00:50:07.631 --> 00:50:10.280
And what's Ryan when mean,
what's the other rex?
Ryan and the,

912
00:50:10.281 --> 00:50:11.170
what's the brother's name?

913
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.520
The one who looks like fucking the dude runs a tilt a world,
that fucking guy.

914
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.440
Right?
I mean those guys are gotta be no that great.
They're great.
So I mean,

915
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:24.100
I was not happy when rex got fired.
I don't like seeing people get fired,

916
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.960
but like I knew he was going to catch on somewhere else,

917
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:27.980
but when he was still in our division,
I'm like,
fuck,
I still

918
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.700
<v 1>got to see this guy twice a year.
But he makes it fun though.
He makes it like,</v>

919
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:35.930
to me like that guy and like,
he definitely makes it fun.
But my thing is,

920
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:39.270
I don't like a guy who talks shit when he has a good team and then clams up when

921
00:50:39.271 --> 00:50:42.020
he has a bad team.
It's like still talking shit.
Like that's the whole thing.

922
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:45.030
And like he's,
he's not,
not,
not the way when we want to put the jar,

923
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:48.200
he dialed it back.
But he swayed back.
He,
but he's still like,

924
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:52.220
I saw this whole thing on him,
the way he talks to his team and all like the,

925
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:54.710
you know,
ray Lewis and all them were like,
what the fuck is he like,

926
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.740
we don't need that pep talk.
Like he's talking,
I'm like,
it's a high school team.

927
00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:01.610
You know,
he's still like,
we got to get out there and kick their fucking answers.

928
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.810
It's the Buffalo Lewis.
Ray Lewis never needed a pep talk.

929
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.740
A professional summer.

930
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:10.490
Somebody else probably does great rate for game three and the in the NFL season.

931
00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.870
No,
I love Ray Lewis.
One time they did.
I was think I told the story.

932
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:17.850
One of those outside the lines with Bob Lee or something,
uh,

933
00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.210
on ESPN and he was in,

934
00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:23.150
they had this intense music and he was fucking talking about how,
you know,

935
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.480
his dad wasn't as in his life at that time.
So when he went to high school,

936
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:27.320
he just,

937
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.920
he just went on a fucking Taylor and his dad owned all the records and he broke

938
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:33.970
all the fucking records,
all the football games or something.

939
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.980
Every time I looked up in the stands and he wasn't up there and made me go even

940
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:39.860
harder.
Dude,
this dude was so fucking inspirational.

941
00:51:39.861 --> 00:51:43.880
I went to the gym like every day for like three weeks after that because every

942
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:45.520
time I didn't want to go,
I just kept thinking,

943
00:51:45.521 --> 00:51:47.170
well right Ray Lewis would go right,
right.

944
00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:50.480
Lewis is going to the same thing from watching a Coby doc fiduciary,

945
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:53.720
Coby dark now dude,
you know I,
I'm a Celtics fan.

946
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:56.780
I can't watch anything pro Lakers yo that now I could watch it cause he's out of

947
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:59.090
the fucking loose.
You watch it if you want like that.
Kinda like,

948
00:51:59.091 --> 00:52:00.530
I want to work out like psycho,

949
00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:02.990
like he's a fucking like now he's a maniac and he's what?

950
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:06.140
She fucking pass the ball more.
Yeah,
I never,
that was my big fucking like,

951
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.320
I actually think that they would have won a couple more if he did.
Absolutely.

952
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:13.210
I think that if he had it together,
I think if he had,
I can say that to have him.

953
00:52:13.211 --> 00:52:16.740
I've never played the game on any sort of,
to me,

954
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.910
I'm going to say he would have won two more.
I want to tell you what years.
Right.

955
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.570
And I won't even tell you why.
I'm just going to say that.

956
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:25.790
You're just going to go out on the record and say,
but,
but you want some water?

957
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.660
No,
I'm good.

958
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.420
You're just going to chop ice the microphones you to finish what you were saying

959
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:31.730
about the patriots cause I want to hear what you,
you,
your,

960
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:35.180
your first of all that you know about.
Okay.
When I was going to play,

961
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:39.290
what I was going to say is I know what,
look,

962
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.960
I've watched enough football to know that when in three,

963
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:44.000
four games in September is not even,

964
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:48.770
doesn't even 10% equal up to winning game one of the playoffs in January.

965
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.630
Of course.
Okay.
Cause you're going to run,

966
00:52:50.631 --> 00:52:52.530
it's better than losing three games in the second number,

967
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:55.460
but you're going to run to a fucking teams that are rebuilding.

968
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:58.460
You're going to run and run with teams that have bad ownership,

969
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.880
that have a bad coach.
Some people that have lost the fucking locker room,

970
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.040
like you'll get your injury,
those games,

971
00:53:04.041 --> 00:53:07.370
you're going to get those games like anybody can fucking it these days with all

972
00:53:07.371 --> 00:53:11.600
these fucking rules can throw 304,
300 yards.
Yes.

973
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.110
Between September,
yes,
and I would say mid November,

974
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:16.960
but then when it really starts tightening up and Oh,

975
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.770
it also depends on when you play comes January.
Okay.
When it's one and done,

976
00:53:21.771 --> 00:53:26.130
if you fucking lose like all of a sudden like you know you're not

977
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:30.150
<v 0>now ethnic each week it gets harder and harder and harder.
Yes.
The ownership,</v>

978
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:33.540
the coaches,
the players,
everything gets better and better and better tighten up.

979
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:37.800
Tighten up.
Exactly.
Exactly.
It's like one of those fucking muscle bound guys.

980
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:41.580
They start drinking water but and just,
there's no,
no fat,
no fat.

981
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.410
What they did to fucking the Texans.

982
00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:47.790
The Texans have one of the best defenses in the,
it was a joke.

983
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:52.560
I mean they kicked her ass.
Well that's,
that comes down to like,

984
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.290
you got to understand what you're dealing with with the Patriots is you have a

985
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:58.150
top three owner all time.
I already think,
Nah,

986
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:01.680
maybe that's not to be disrespectful to like,
cause dude,

987
00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:05.700
you got to go George Hallis.
There's a lot of great,
but you have to be you.

988
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:07.050
I love that.
You just don't give a fuck.

989
00:54:07.051 --> 00:54:10.340
Are you going to chomp that ice right into the microphone?
People know.

990
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.240
People know,
no,
don't care.
Can I want to use that next time?

991
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:17.320
Mia gives me shit for doing something within my math.

992
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.850
People know they don't care.
Like dude,
his fucking,

993
00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:25.770
his three coaching hires have been bill Parcells,
Pete Carroll,

994
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.610
Bill Bellacheck,
right.
There's two quarterbacks have been drew Bledsoe.
Tom Brady.

995
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.310
Is that it?
That's it.
Damn.
That's fucking good luck to men.

996
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:37.080
It that is good luck with the fact that Brady's able to play this long is good

997
00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:37.721
luck.
Oh,

998
00:54:37.721 --> 00:54:40.830
somebody told me they know a guy that knows a guy that knows him and it's like,

999
00:54:40.831 --> 00:54:43.400
that guy literally knows what he's having for lunch like three years.

1000
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:47.250
I'm sure he's probably,
he's like a closet Kolbe.
He's a fucking lunatic.

1001
00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:51.620
You have to be,
you had also its lunches.
It's funny to me the injuries are luck,

1002
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:54.750
Pronoun and injuries.
And you know what Slaac is that he got to play for bill.

1003
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:57.360
Bill Bellacheck absolutely the same way per show.

1004
00:54:57.370 --> 00:55:01.960
Montel Montana was lucky that he got to play for Fucking,
uh,

1005
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:02.980
Bill Walsh.
Yeah.

1006
00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.980
I would say Dan Marino was unlucky to play with Don Shula when he was towards

1007
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:10.970
the end of his career.
I agree.
Because the,

1008
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.400
the game had changed and when Bill Walsh came in with the west coast offense and

1009
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:16.950
all that,
and that fucking guy for as much shit as he gets,

1010
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.450
look up his running backs right.
That he had,
that guy never had a running game,

1011
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:24.520
never had a fucking running game.
He never really had is uh,
Jerry.

1012
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:28.650
He had duper and Clayton that more.
Right.
He never had like a Randy Moss,

1013
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:33.270
right level fucking guy and like,
you know,
his defense was the killer bees.

1014
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.330
They had like the last two like white quarterbacks ever.
Ever.
Yeah.

1015
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:42.390
It was like the Blackledge ledger,
blackwood brothers while and Kyle's yes,

1016
00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.370
I remember that.
Yeah.
That was Jay Dewey.
Bob.
Yes.
Students.

1017
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.090
It looked like the 72 team,

1018
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:51.310
the amount of fucking white dudes that were on that thing.
Yeah.
Um,

1019
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.180
no disrespect to any of those guys,
but what the fuck?
No,
it's shit,

1020
00:55:54.181 --> 00:55:56.700
it's shit that that guy was going.
Absolutely.
It was like,

1021
00:55:56.701 --> 00:55:59.850
was he supposed to tackle people too,
right?
I mean that guy,

1022
00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:04.140
like the amount of rule changes that they had to make in the NFL for his fucking

1023
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.630
like 84 season record phrase ball.

1024
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.480
And he did that back when I think you could spy 84,

1025
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:14.210
you could still wear stick them.
I know that it was like covering receivers.

1026
00:56:14.211 --> 00:56:17.610
What's my man's name on it?
Oh Mom.
Oh Hey.
Yes,
the fucking Hayes.

1027
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:21.060
And I think it was eerie is Lester Hayes.
Aren't you getting him on the podcast?

1028
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.160
Lester Hayes.
Cause I figured he's busy

1029
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:28.030
<v 1>doing something.
One of the great suck to something.</v>

1030
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.780
Yeah but I think you know and that was still like the Mel blunt rules as far as

1031
00:56:31.781 --> 00:56:36.370
coverage and all of that.
What they've done is they say some of it's for safety.

1032
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:38.710
I think most of it,
it means it's always about money.

1033
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:39.820
Even if they say it's about safety,

1034
00:56:39.821 --> 00:56:42.100
it's not cause they give a fuck about the players is cause they don't want to

1035
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:43.830
deal with another class action law suit.
Right.

1036
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:48.990
And then also they know that offense offense sells like here's the deal dude.

1037
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.270
You and I do.
Do you watch fucking soccer?
No.

1038
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.390
Let's say each game was like 10 to eight.
You want to watch,

1039
00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.200
you have more appeal to watch because I don't understand that 90 minutes and

1040
00:56:59.201 --> 00:57:03.460
it's one zero get the fuck out in our last call might come in the last minute

1041
00:57:03.461 --> 00:57:07.540
thing though.
But if you,
if you go into a s uh,
football bar,

1042
00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:08.950
it's switch what they really call it.

1043
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.580
Or if you're over in England and they're watching the premier league and people

1044
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:15.520
are fucking end of this shit,
right.
I always say when I stand there,

1045
00:57:15.521 --> 00:57:16.150
it's like I wouldn't,

1046
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:20.410
I just need to live in this country for about three weeks and I would have a

1047
00:57:20.411 --> 00:57:23.770
team and I would have a scarf and I would be learning the socks.
Right.

1048
00:57:23.771 --> 00:57:26.650
I know that that's true.
But the thing is is we already got,
we got our four,

1049
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:31.570
it's cultural.
I see.
I still watched like I still watch a little bit of tennis,

1050
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.060
right?
I'll watch the golf.
I got into Formula One racing.

1051
00:57:34.061 --> 00:57:37.600
Like I kind of all over the place,
man.
I go watch that shit for me.
One racing.

1052
00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.790
Yeah,
I love it.
And you're talking to me about housewives.

1053
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.600
You weren't fucking cars.
Go Zoom,
zoom.

1054
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:45.460
Well it's not like Nascar where they just drive around in a giant circle.

1055
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.710
There's like left and right turns this all kinds of shit.

1056
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.920
And then you know what else love.
It's Sorta like the Illuminati sport,

1057
00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:53.050
you know what I mean?
Like yachting is fucking,

1058
00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.780
it's like you have to know how to sail to see what the fuck's going on there.

1059
00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:59.560
Right.
That shit is just like,
like I remember the right,

1060
00:57:59.561 --> 00:58:00.880
the first race that I watched this year.

1061
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:03.670
I kind of watch it every year as the one in Monaco.
I know nothing.

1062
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:05.950
You're like eight and I'm like,
I'm supposed to be like,
yeah,
okay.
I don't know.

1063
00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:09.670
Right.
The France,
you know Monica?
I actually never been to France,

1064
00:58:09.671 --> 00:58:11.920
believe it or never been.
A friend won't let me in Paris.

1065
00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:15.100
The mother never went to Cannes or anything.
I never went to cons.

1066
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:19.150
Never been to Paris.
It's I need to go.
You got to go.
I know.
I know you.

1067
00:58:19.151 --> 00:58:20.950
When I say right now,
you bring your fucking wife,

1068
00:58:20.951 --> 00:58:24.070
they're over over and you know what's great to can throw it in their fucking

1069
00:58:24.071 --> 00:58:27.250
face for a while.
Right?
You can do.
That'll work for you for about a year,

1070
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:30.220
year and a half now.
It's a woman too.
It's about six weeks.
Okay.

1071
00:58:30.221 --> 00:58:33.680
It's a great six week.
Paris,
France.
The whole thing.
He touched you.

1072
00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.380
You just take into Paris and it just,
this is what I do.
Like I,

1073
00:58:36.381 --> 00:58:37.690
I don't look at her when I say it,

1074
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:40.230
I just sort of stare out the window and just talk to myself like,
Hey,

1075
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.180
you'd think if Davy brought somebody to Paris,
right.

1076
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.120
Keep it good for at least three days.
Cool.
And what goes cool from,

1077
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:51.600
she always laughs,
he goes,
you don't take me to Paris to throw it in my face.
Go.

1078
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:54.610
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
I do.
Yeah.
I don't know 100% do that.

1079
00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.790
But like if you think that you're going to go to Paris and then come back here

1080
00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:00.640
and fucking call me on my shit,
you're not gonna hear about it.

1081
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.430
I shouldn't be allowed to go off the rails.
Yeah.

1082
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.540
I should be able to have a nice drink and habit.
Yeah.

1083
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.200
Text her a picture of weeks.
She said,
what are you doing?

1084
00:59:08.201 --> 00:59:10.650
Are you texted her a picture of like you and her kissing under the Eiffel Tower?

1085
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.560
I remember this.
You want to fucking break my balls though?
You don't want to.

1086
00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.830
I got this picture,
I get it.

1087
00:59:14.831 --> 00:59:19.831
I got it in my phone of Rihanna and she's courtside at a basketball game and

1088
00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:21.920
she's like looking up at the

1089
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.750
<v 0>scoreboard.</v>

1090
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:25.370
I don't know if she needs glasses but you know when people need glasses then

1091
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.250
making that thing,
it's perfect the way she's looking.

1092
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:31.370
So whenever Nia texts me something and I don't want to do it,

1093
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:34.610
I just send her that picture and it looks like Rihanna is like looking up at it

1094
00:59:34.611 --> 00:59:35.421
like what the fuck is,

1095
00:59:35.421 --> 00:59:39.420
that always makes her laugh and I swear to God like 40% of the time I get out of

1096
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.910
whatever the hell she wants me to do.
Do you do you find,

1097
00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:46.660
because I know I do like arguing as I used to be arguing of football,

1098
00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:51.670
you know,
no more don't seem so easy going.
I know.
Shocker,

1099
00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:56.240
right,
but in relationships I don't argue no more like I'm done.
I don't,

1100
00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.070
what am I cause not arm wrestling when I figured out there's no actual winning

1101
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:05.240
and no actual losing.
Yeah,
there is no,
there isn't.
There isn't.

1102
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:09.870
There is certain things on certain things.
There's certain certain behaviors,

1103
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:11.810
certain behavior,
yes,

1104
01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:16.010
but 99% of the argument you have in a relationship with a woman or a man,

1105
01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:18.590
whoever's listening to this,
you have a big,
a lot of women listening to the show.

1106
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.630
I don't think so.
Probably not.
Why?
Why would they,
why would they fucking wasted?

1107
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.250
Because their husbands or boyfriends listened to and the public and I fucking

1108
01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:28.280
hate this guy.
I can't fucking stand these two of them and doing this shit.

1109
01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:31.790
Now it's usually one is usually the one guy's in there talking to himself as a

1110
01:00:31.791 --> 01:00:36.290
sausage fest,
Mike.
But,
but I don't,
I don't argue.
I mean,
Eh,

1111
01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:40.010
I'm not saying it's perfect,
but I,
the arguing that the bantering,

1112
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:42.020
the bickering about little shit,
I don't do it.

1113
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.440
That's the one thing that I've gotten being a little older and more experienced

1114
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:50.330
divorce.
Oh,
I don't,
I don't bicker.
I don't pick up.
But if there's some bullshit,

1115
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.550
right.
All right.
I'll own up to it.
Maybe not right then,
but I,
I couldn't,

1116
01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.880
I can within an hour cool off.
It'd be like,
you know,
right.

1117
01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.970
You put the hour so you need the hour.

1118
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.480
I used to need forever because you called me one time.
Something was going,

1119
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:05.110
I was like,
you would like we were,
you were,
we were arguing about Pa.

1120
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:05.481
You were like,

1121
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:08.650
am a job in the house and I'm an undetermined to fuck you and your fucking and

1122
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.600
Cavaliers and they're going.
I was like,
what the fuck?

1123
01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:15.050
And then you were like going on,
I,
we're already,
you're like,
oh,
I'm walking.

1124
01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:17.780
I was up at my house and I was like,
what the fuck is wrong with this guy?

1125
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.070
And I was like,
oh somebody,
another guy who's been married forever told me,

1126
01:01:21.071 --> 01:01:23.300
he goes,
he goes,
just go for a walk.
So I started doing that,

1127
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.300
but then what's fucked up is then I walked down the street with like Tourette's

1128
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.450
and everybody's looking at me like I'm out of my mind talking to yourself,

1129
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:31.310
talk on the phone,
talking to,

1130
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:35.890
are you arguing with yourself based voice by yourself,
by myself.
Fuck and do it.

1131
01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:40.700
It's just every other word is fuck you want to hit something fucking hilarious.

1132
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.300
So I'm doing the road this week and yeah,
we're at,
uh,

1133
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.300
I'm doing a couple nights in Madison,

1134
01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:51.050
Wisconsin than a bone in Nebraska during the day I'm going to the corn husker

1135
01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:55.100
game.
Oh Shit.
Playing the lion,
I,
and then I'm going up to Omaha to do the show.

1136
01:01:55.101 --> 01:01:56.960
So I,
uh,

1137
01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.340
I go on one of these tickets sites to fucking get my tickets.
Right.
So I fucking,

1138
01:02:01.341 --> 01:02:04.040
you know,
pay through the nose to get them,
cause I,
I almost fight yourself.

1139
01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:06.560
You're going to the gun and I'm going with,
with the other Nate cry.
Right,
right.

1140
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:10.070
Okay.
So I get these fucking tick,
you know,
I get the tickets,

1141
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:10.980
I'm all set right now.

1142
01:02:10.981 --> 01:02:13.640
I'm thinking like it's a couple of days before the fuck one of these things

1143
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.780
coming.
So I look on my confirmation thing,
it says we're going to overnight him.

1144
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.470
It's like the day after I'm leaving,

1145
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.850
<v 1>so I fucking call up the one eight,
eight 88 number and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.</v>

1146
01:02:23.851 --> 01:02:28.290
I can't get anyone on the phone,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
So I just say,
fuck this,

1147
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:29.790
I'm going to these other guys.
Right.

1148
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.510
And I fire off this email to the first people just go on like,
yeah,

1149
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.860
this is my situation.
Blahblahblahblahblah why can't I talk to a person?

1150
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.660
Why is it so difficult?
Why did your machine hang up on me?
And I said,

1151
01:02:42.661 --> 01:02:47.640
I'm going to fucking,
I go,
I have a podcast,
I'm going to trash you guys.

1152
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.540
Right?
I forgot,
I forgot that my email.

1153
01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:55.890
Like just my name shows up,
right?
So I fucking,

1154
01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.200
I send this thing in this anger,
right?

1155
01:02:58.201 --> 01:02:59.960
And then I immediately go to this next slide.

1156
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:01.770
Don't even wait for these people because they said,

1157
01:03:01.771 --> 01:03:02.810
if you have a problem sending right,

1158
01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.520
you don't even don't even wait for him to try to resolve it.
Right.

1159
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.400
So I immediately go to the next one,
give me the two best you've got.

1160
01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:11.970
And I got a person and she was great.
I could talk on the phone.
It was all fine.

1161
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.610
They gave it to me,
I print them out,
I'm all fucking set.
Right?

1162
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:17.850
Fucking like three hours later I get this phone call.
It's like,

1163
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:22.260
had a guy on the website,
he's like,
yeah man,
sorry.
You have a difficult time.

1164
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:25.190
Well we'll have these things overnighted out to you.

1165
01:03:25.191 --> 01:03:29.340
I hope there wasn't any inconvenience.
No big deal.
A big fan of the podcast.

1166
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.310
And I just,
I felt like an idiot.
I go,
all right man,
thanks a lot.

1167
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:36.270
And now you've got four tickets for tickets that tonight I paid through the
nose.

1168
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:40.530
That's fucking did you,
you didn't,
you just took it and were like,
okay,
thank you.

1169
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:44.170
And you didn't,
you didn't,
you just kept it moving.
No,
cause I was rough.

1170
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.720
I'm not addicted.
I am an idiot.
Right.
But I'm not a dick.
Like I was wrong.

1171
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:51.720
And I was sitting there when they called back and there was something in my head

1172
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:54.240
going like,
dude,
you should probably wait a couple hours.

1173
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:55.820
But I was like in a panic because I hear you.

1174
01:03:55.821 --> 01:03:57.000
You thought it was going to the airport today.

1175
01:03:57.001 --> 01:04:00.480
I'm not going to the mall because I never look at my itinerary until like the

1176
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.370
night before.
And uh,
yeah.
So,
you know,
my,
my,
I'm,
I'm literally,
you know,
I'm to do,

1177
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:08.980
I'm going to,
I'm going to put on a post it on my dashboard because the cars,

1178
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.130
the big thing where I really feel bad for my wife,
right?

1179
01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.600
I'm just going to write like a,
I forgot I hadn't,

1180
01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:18.210
this little fucking thing I was going to write and all I know is it just ended

1181
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:19.700
with God bless these cuts.

1182
01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.310
I was just going to put me in a silly mood and I'm like,
dude,

1183
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:27.690
I almost need to like meditate before I go.
I hear you.
I hear you.
I hear you.

1184
01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:31.050
We mean you should go to meditation class.
I needed to know,

1185
01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:34.010
but I don't think you and I can't help each other.
Like I've had to,
right.

1186
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:34.850
I one time,

1187
01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:38.540
you'll a third party need to intervene because a long time ago I remember,
I,
uh,

1188
01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:44.070
I w I dated this woman and she was an angry psycho into conspiracy theory too,

1189
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.250
right?
And we were not a yin and a Yang.
Now you care and how,
you know,

1190
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.730
and it's just like we just fed off each other and it was just this downward

1191
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.760
spiral of negativity.

1192
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:57.960
Anger stole that event at the world that eventually turned inward.

1193
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:02.220
I got that was just like,
I agree.
Yes,
relationships.
You,
you,
you can't,

1194
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:06.570
you can't like,
oh,
we're just the same bad.
All you young motherfuckers out there,

1195
01:05:06.571 --> 01:05:09.540
I'm not,
listen,
I'm not.
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a onetime loser.
I got divorced.

1196
01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.900
I have fucking bad history released.
I'm in a great one now.

1197
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.590
But all that shit,
we're just the same.
No,
you don't have to send a red flag.

1198
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:18.040
We know what the

1199
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.980
<v 0>sad,
you want to find somebody like we're just the same.
Do not do that.</v>

1200
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:23.080
That's a tip.
This is a sad thing out there.

1201
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:26.320
This is really depressing for guys like you and me have to be with the

1202
01:05:26.321 --> 01:05:29.220
sweetheart.
Gado all right,
so with the sad thing is,

1203
01:05:29.221 --> 01:05:33.490
is so many sweethearts end up with people like us.
Like,
I always wondered like,

1204
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:34.930
you know,
if it was a fair world,

1205
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.630
I would end up with the version of me and then I would fucking,
we,

1206
01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:42.340
I would have to somehow try to bear myself natural love each other into fucking

1207
01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:44.520
like a day.
And I was like,
yeah,
and we wouldn't reproduce it.

1208
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:46.480
And that would be fucking it.
But like sweet,
like,

1209
01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:50.800
I'm trying to think if I ever saw a couple where it was just two sweethearts.

1210
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.600
Yeah,
I see that every once in a while.
You can't too.
Sweethearts will work too.

1211
01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:59.830
Sweet.
I sweetheart in a lunatic or work to lunatics.
It's,
it'll,

1212
01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:02.210
it'll get a bit of catch up with you.
You'll,

1213
01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:06.130
you'll eat each other from the inside 48 it's gone down.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1214
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.460
It will catch up with you.
What?
You'll either kill each other,

1215
01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:13.990
your key or just emotionally dis rip yourself out.
Your innards,
who will be,

1216
01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:17.530
will be ripped out.
Hey,
before we got a little over an hour here,

1217
01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:20.020
I usually just do a half hour unless I get a great guest like you.

1218
01:06:20.021 --> 01:06:23.500
So let's wrap it up here.
Talking about the giants.
Yes,
no,

1219
01:06:23.501 --> 01:06:26.910
I'm going to talk about your giants here.
Go ahead.
Eli had one of his classic,

1220
01:06:26.911 --> 01:06:30.850
a September Games where he threw two picks and blah,
blah blah.

1221
01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:34.530
And then I know every mouth on the only the mouth breathing giant fans are like,

1222
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.850
dude,
we gotta fucking get rid of this guy and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1223
01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:41.970
My theory on Eli Eli is fucking board in September and October.

1224
01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:46.600
He's coasting and he has to wait till it's like,
Hey Eli,

1225
01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:51.550
we have to win the last six fucking games or else we don't make the playoffs.

1226
01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:53.320
And then,
and then he goes,
oh,
all right.

1227
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:57.490
And you think because he wears a blue sport coat and fucking those Pete Carroll

1228
01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:57.880
Docker's no,

1229
01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.180
you just thinking that this guy doesn't have the Septum and that guy does.

1230
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:05.650
He has it in him.
He's a motherfucker.
He gets the later it gets,

1231
01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:09.430
the better he is.
Yes he is.
And this is the thing,
dude,

1232
01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:13.000
like he doesn't have Payton's stats.
No,

1233
01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:17.260
but his fucking record in January into February,
I mean this is fucking insane.

1234
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:20.230
He's got two rings.
They're playing Minnesota this weekend.

1235
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.640
I'm scared of that Minnesota defense.
They did.
I heard they're good.
Yo.

1236
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:28.270
They had Aaron Rodgers like they're the,
the the,

1237
01:07:28.271 --> 01:07:30.400
the offensive line was giving him protection.

1238
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:34.330
The secondary they lock shut down.
Cam Newton,

1239
01:07:34.331 --> 01:07:39.280
they have guys on that team,
they're red blooded American straight goons.

1240
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.700
They were body slam and Cam Newton not just sacking him.

1241
01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.880
Some mother fucker picked him up and threw him on the ground.
I was like,

1242
01:07:45.881 --> 01:07:49.570
what the f Cam Newton and they didn't throw a flag either.
Yo,

1243
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.130
I think the ref was just like,
oh,
like scared.
Like it was like a violent sack.

1244
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:57.340
Like he picked him up and through Cam Newton to the girl,
you have to,

1245
01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.930
you know strong.
You have to be to do that.

1246
01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:02.140
I don't know who it was and I saw him one time in real life too.
Like Kiss Cam,

1247
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:06.490
Cam Newton.
He was the most amazing thing about that guy.
His feet dude.

1248
01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:09.910
His feet like he has like a size,
like it looked like a 20 yeah,

1249
01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.430
he's a fucking beast.
I just thought if I was like,

1250
01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:15.920
if that gave a walk by and accidentally if stuff I was wearing timberlands,

1251
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:19.590
I probably still break to Towson.
Yeah.
And if he was walking he'll about rag man,

1252
01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:23.540
he's gigantic.
He's like six,
six,
I think gotta be at least six,

1253
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:26.840
five like a real six,
five and like a fucking like,

1254
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.620
like he's like a bodyguard like aside from being that good looking and handsome

1255
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.750
you'd like this guy could be like outside of club,

1256
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:36.530
like holding the whole shit down like a fucking good,
like he's goon size,

1257
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:37.431
you know what I'm saying?

1258
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:41.270
Like you know his head is like you should be in the VIP in his body as he should

1259
01:08:41.271 --> 01:08:45.620
be guarding the door.
He's a goon man and that fucking guy on the vikings,

1260
01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:46.500
I don't know who is not,

1261
01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:50.270
I didn't see that game but that immediately I was waiting for people to go like,

1262
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.820
well how come if it's a white quarterback like Tom Brady,

1263
01:08:52.821 --> 01:08:54.860
all of a sudden the flags coming up.
And then I'm also thinking,

1264
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.450
has he not been in the league long enough?

1265
01:08:56.451 --> 01:08:59.990
But I think he's making the league enough fucking money that from what people

1266
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:03.340
said about that game,
he should have got a couple of Tom Brady.
Hey,

1267
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:06.080
go easy on the dimple.
They gotta they gotta take it easy on them,

1268
01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:08.920
but this wasn't an illegal hit.
It was just like,
oh,
okay.

1269
01:09:08.921 --> 01:09:12.200
Well got him in his arms and literally like slammed him down.
He's like,

1270
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:16.010
the guy didn't fall down on him.
Like he picked him up and threw him down.

1271
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:18.440
Like he didn't like take him to the ground.
I still had the ball.

1272
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.350
He had the fucking balls.
Okay,
well then forget he's a legal hit.

1273
01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:24.050
It wasn't like Denver where they were like,
you know,
going at his head,

1274
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:27.440
it was just normal.
You see a guy like drew Brees get hit like that,

1275
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:31.930
like a smaller guy like this guy to do that to Cam Newton.
I was like so divided.

1276
01:09:31.931 --> 01:09:35.060
What's funny too is drew breeze is huddles.
He's like six [inaudible],
right?

1277
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:39.600
Six one probably what?
Two 2010 right.
But compared to Cam Newton,
he's like,
oh,

1278
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.560
but wait,
but when,
yeah,

1279
01:09:40.561 --> 01:09:43.940
it was some saying like how tough those guys are that they could take a six one

1280
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:47.480
210 pound guy who I just give my wallet too.
Right.

1281
01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:50.900
It could like throw him through the wall like nothing yet just bumping into him,

1282
01:09:50.901 --> 01:09:53.750
trying to get to the fucking running back zero.
Nothing don't though.

1283
01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.110
Those guys are,
but the vikings defense,
they're,
they're,

1284
01:09:57.111 --> 01:10:00.230
they're the most impressive thing that I've seen all season in terms of like,

1285
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.420
I'm going to watch that game.
Who's,
who's your pick this year?

1286
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.620
You've got to go with your heart.
Say that giants prepared.
I got to go you.

1287
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:09.680
I'm like if you say who's going to win the Superbowl and I say the Patriots,

1288
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.370
I'm not saying who I want.

1289
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.230
Like if I say who do I think is going to win the Superbowl?

1290
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.400
I say the Patriots are going to right now based on the injuries and the way

1291
01:10:19.401 --> 01:10:22.940
everything is now,
it's four weeks in,
you know like long ways off.

1292
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.520
But if you add like I think Seattle's a wrap look good.

1293
01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:29.650
I hear the eagles look good quarterback,
but there he,
oh,
he's,

1294
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:34.130
he's only three games.
He's not just all right.
He's superseded.
But you know,

1295
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:35.720
you think,
I mean we need to what?

1296
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:38.750
They haven't had a quarterback since fucking Donovan McNabb superseded the fact

1297
01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:42.240
that he wasn't even going to fucking suit up the first week.
And He,
I mean he,

1298
01:10:42.241 --> 01:10:46.130
he had,
he did he the 3.0 and he's a big part of it.

1299
01:10:46.131 --> 01:10:49.580
It's not like they're doing some trickery like Cleveland where like just making

1300
01:10:49.581 --> 01:10:53.120
it happen.
Or if like Edelman plays for a quarterback,

1301
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:54.500
like he's a fucking quarterback.

1302
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:58.740
Like he's there three and now like San Francisco and,
and,

1303
01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:00.740
and Philadelphia and the preseason,
you were like,

1304
01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:02.690
they're not going to score points.
Like,
you know,

1305
01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:06.890
they traded Stan Bradford and then this Guy Carson Wentz and all of a sudden

1306
01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:10.210
there's these,
I'm Sam Bradford in Minnesota.
He is,
and the,

1307
01:11:10.211 --> 01:11:12.950
and then the other quarterback was supposed to start before Carson Wentz.

1308
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:16.290
And then whenever we're born your fence,
listen,
Bill Burr,

1309
01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.360
what do you got to promote?
What I got nothing.

1310
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:20.220
I got the iron Rapaport Stereo podcast.

1311
01:11:20.221 --> 01:11:24.360
I want to officially say at some point when bill burrs,
in traveling,

1312
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.100
selling,
selling out arenas,
we will eat this food,
this steak.

1313
01:11:29.101 --> 01:11:30.980
I will pay my debt.
I'm not avoiding that.

1314
01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:34.890
So don't fucking tweet me with your shit and your threats and all that bullshit,

1315
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:38.040
but I appreciate you having me on.
It's always a pleasure.
I did.

1316
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.290
I did go on record saying that.
If you ask me right now,

1317
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:42.840
who would win the Super Bowl?
I said,
whoa.
You said the Patriots.

1318
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:46.050
I didn't say I wanted it to happen,
but I said it can.
The Patriot,

1319
01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:49.380
I'm taking the pages right now based on all every,
everybody stays healthy.

1320
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:52.200
What about your fucking guy real quick?
Gronk Koski when did he,

1321
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:54.720
what's his problem?
What do you mean?
They're like,
oh he's,

1322
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:58.020
he all of a sudden he's hurt.
He's not playing.
What's that bullshit about?
Well,

1323
01:11:58.021 --> 01:12:00.360
they always disguised.
They don't want to say where the guy's hurt.

1324
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:04.080
They don't want the animals to go after it.
Okay.
It's all right.
Okay.

1325
01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:06.300
Cause I know you're not in the fantasy football,

1326
01:12:06.301 --> 01:12:09.480
but you know even that even New England Patriot diehards that are in the fantasy

1327
01:12:09.481 --> 01:12:13.830
that drafted the Gronk and the first round they got fucked because they didn't

1328
01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:16.170
say anything about any injuries.
How did he get fucked?

1329
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.110
Because you should leave like you didn't lose my league.
You know I can't,

1330
01:12:20.111 --> 01:12:23.100
but if you don't like fantasy,
you're so fucking stupid.
I love it.

1331
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:25.260
It's the stupidest shit out of it.

1332
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:28.230
You all this shit that I was just talking about eight drafted him.

1333
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:32.580
I get a moment,
it's like
I'm a fucking gem.

1334
01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.440
Eminem.
I'm an owner.
I own a finish.
It's like playing risk.

1335
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:41.160
I love it when people play risk and they start feeling like that they're Hitler

1336
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:44.440
taken over Europe or some shit.
The reason why you're playing a board game,
I,

1337
01:12:44.441 --> 01:12:48.600
I totally have a different appreciate like I could talk about every teams when I

1338
01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:52.440
do like about fantasy football is you guys know the players way more than I do.

1339
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.180
Then a normal fan,
I don't have time.

1340
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:59.210
I know half of you guys could do color commentator who like the backup punter is

1341
01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:01.140
cause he's fucked you on.
Absolutely.

1342
01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:05.660
You guys who play fantasy football and degenerate gamblers.
Absolutely.
No,

1343
01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:08.910
as much as a color commentator.
Absolutely.
I and I played in low stakes.

1344
01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:11.280
It just was fun.
But that the,
the biggest thing,

1345
01:13:11.281 --> 01:13:14.070
the biggest takeaway from all of the,
I mean the shit talk I like,

1346
01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.210
I love the shit talk,

1347
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.330
but the thing that I really take away from it is that I have a whole different

1348
01:13:18.331 --> 01:13:19.670
appreciation for the entire league.

1349
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.150
Not just the giants are not just the jets are just the Patriots,

1350
01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:25.380
the teams that are against the giant.
Well I will say back in the,

1351
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.370
when I was a kid and I collected football cards,
I knew every stat,

1352
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.870
I knew what college you went to,
academia,

1353
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:35.490
offensive line type of shit of everybody.
And,
and what I hated was when I,

1354
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.110
when I got a little older,
I was like,
you know,

1355
01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:41.820
I'm going to go back to doing that because it was a cool way to,
uh,

1356
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.880
to learn it right down to go on a website.
And try to figure this shit out.

1357
01:13:44.881 --> 01:13:49.440
It's a pain in the ass.
Um,
you just had the guy,
you flipped it over.

1358
01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:52.410
They had every season and then they didn't do that anymore.

1359
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:55.410
Right when I stopped cars and then they try to make certain you couldn't just

1360
01:13:55.411 --> 01:13:56.520
buy the set.
No.

1361
01:13:56.521 --> 01:14:00.030
And they're like an electronic cards and they tried to make them RF artificially

1362
01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:03.800
rare so they're worth something because you know,
I guess a bunch of guys my age,

1363
01:14:03.801 --> 01:14:05.790
he started collecting again for the wrong reasons.

1364
01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:09.120
I wanted to collect just cause I wanted to get to know them cause my first 10,

1365
01:14:09.121 --> 01:14:12.160
12 years of doing stand up,
like I just was working

1366
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.993
<v 1>so much,</v>

1367
01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.870
I kind of lost touch with like a generation of players and I just wanted to go

1368
01:14:16.871 --> 01:14:17.860
meet too.
Yeah.

1369
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:21.850
And I wanted to really go back into collecting cars and stuff just so I could

1370
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:24.370
just have 'em out.
Like,
I'd,
you know,

1371
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:27.570
I'd rather have them out on the table and just line them up the way they were

1372
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.400
telling me when I would watch a game and the guy would make a play and I would

1373
01:14:30.401 --> 01:14:33.910
just turn over it like even like block,
my dad used to be like Jesus Christ,

1374
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:34.751
you know,
every,

1375
01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:38.800
but meanwhile I was flunking everything and Beasley Reese was out too.

1376
01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:41.980
I R C Thielemann,
I knew all the guys on Falcons.

1377
01:14:41.981 --> 01:14:45.900
I knew all of these fucking guys.
Joe De Lamea,

1378
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:50.110
I knew all of these offensive guards and,
and,
and I just fucking knew everybody.

1379
01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:52.210
I knew where they went to school,
all this fucking trivia.

1380
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:57.220
I knew what the size cleat that Louie Culture War,
right?
Rare facts,
all of that.

1381
01:14:57.221 --> 01:15:00.010
She was mom's name.
His mom's name is lovely,
you know,

1382
01:15:00.011 --> 01:15:01.570
like some weird shit on the back of the car.

1383
01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:06.760
He wants returned three fucking scores for a touchdown when he played in high

1384
01:15:06.761 --> 01:15:09.730
school and like,
and then the commentator would say it,
my dad be like,

1385
01:15:09.731 --> 01:15:12.850
for Christ's sake,
how do you know that?
I'd be like getting attention from him.

1386
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.460
I certainly wasn't with you were getting the wrong kind of attention with the

1387
01:15:15.461 --> 01:15:19.000
report card.
So I do,
that's the only thing about fantasy.

1388
01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:23.160
That's what I love about it.
That does appeal to me.
But sitting there,
uh,

1389
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:25.630
I dunno it,
it just seems so fun.

1390
01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:29.000
<v 0>Can time consuming.
It's not,
it's always,
it's time consuming as it is.</v>

1391
01:15:29.001 --> 01:15:30.170
You make it like,
I mean I,

1392
01:15:30.171 --> 01:15:34.760
I'm fucking nuts with it because I'm like obsessed with it cause you're crazy

1393
01:15:34.761 --> 01:15:37.030
cause I'm crazy.
But,
but the,
the,
the,
the,

1394
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:42.020
the re my rejuvenation for the NFL because when I had my kids Sunday would be

1395
01:15:42.021 --> 01:15:42.854
kids time.

1396
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:47.890
So I lost track of a lot of shit for like either because you're fucking sleeping

1397
01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:49.650
because it's the weekend or you're like,

1398
01:15:49.651 --> 01:15:52.070
oh you gotta go to fucking drive them to their games.

1399
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:56.690
Flag football games or football games or parties or fucking Bar Mitzvahs at this

1400
01:15:56.691 --> 01:16:00.080
pool party and sit there and talk to other parents while the fucking giants are

1401
01:16:00.081 --> 01:16:03.650
winning full.
Is that experience.
Oh my God,
you're going to,
you know,
if you,

1402
01:16:03.651 --> 01:16:08.180
and you have kids,
whoa my goodness.
It's going to fucking parties.

1403
01:16:08.181 --> 01:16:12.320
And socializing with people and no,
I'm not going to be a good thing.
It's tough.

1404
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:17.290
It's rough,
but I'm bad at that.
Not being a parent,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's going to,

1405
01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.460
boy,
you're going to have to do it.
When you have kids,

1406
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:22.190
you have to do it because it's not like la where you're like,

1407
01:16:22.191 --> 01:16:25.750
go outside and play.
I'm just,
I'll draft behind you that day ever comes.

1408
01:16:25.850 --> 01:16:29.740
I'm telling you,
she'll it,
she'll go with a big smile and do you have a boy your,

1409
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:33.380
there's no way to avoid it.
It,
it,
you have to do it.
And it's,
it was,

1410
01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.610
it was rough for me to do.
Like it's so outside of my thing,

1411
01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:37.444
I like to sit there and like,

1412
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:41.480
when they're four and five at like Spiderman is at the party and Spiderman's in

1413
01:16:41.481 --> 01:16:44.720
a jumpsuit and his fucking balls are flopping around and you're talking to the

1414
01:16:44.721 --> 01:16:46.750
other parents,
he's like,
so what do you do it like,
ah,

1415
01:16:47.210 --> 01:16:50.060
you don't know who the fuck I am and no,
this is

1416
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:54.690
<v 1>the best in the ally.
Yeah.
Well I'm a,
I drive a truck.
Yeah.
Well,
I had computers.</v>

1417
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:56.350
I used to say I'm in computers,

1418
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:59.030
but then they would ask me a followup question and I'll just went off the rails.

1419
01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:02.020
You don't have plan B?
Yeah.
What kind of computers?

1420
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:06.760
The computers do lap laptops.
Yeah.
Sell them.
You work at apple store.

1421
01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:09.250
All right bill.
I'm out.
Wrapped us up.
All Right Mike,

1422
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:13.610
we'll wrapping it up with Michael Rappaport.
Uh,
thanks for coming on.

1423
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:17.000
Picking the Patriots fantasy football.
You can,
uh,

1424
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:18.570
you can catch him on Andy Cohen show.

1425
01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:24.020
So a Zillion fucking movies and the Michael Rappaport.

1426
01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.720
I am Rapaport Stereo podcast Stereo Stereo.
I'm out.
Wow,

1427
01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.520
<v 2>right.
He is the uh,</v>

1428
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:35.260
is he advertising here for Thursday?
You know,
what are you going to do?

1429
01:17:35.261 --> 01:17:39.190
This is obviously recorded later as you can tell them a tone of my voice.

1430
01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:42.670
Rapaport is left.
All right.
Lift everybody.

1431
01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.590
You know about Lyft,
right?
Do you,

1432
01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:52.380
it's the APP that gets you a ride in minutes on demand 24 motherfucking seven

1433
01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:58.180
for less than the cost of a cab.
Please include all the following points.

1434
01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.360
If you fucking write it.
I'm going to read this.
Give us the keys.

1435
01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:07.390
Um,
if you've tried Lyft,
you know what I mean?
With lifts,

1436
01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:09.670
you just download the APP,
request a driver,

1437
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:14.740
and they show up in three and a half minutes.
On average.
That's really fast.

1438
01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:19.570
Every Lyft driver is fully vetted through that 10 point safety standard.

1439
01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:24.900
Unlike those other people that you can walk out of jail and just become up,

1440
01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:28.510
I can't say the name,
but it rhymes with scrubber.
Um,

1441
01:18:28.511 --> 01:18:31.750
including criminal and DMV background checks,
you know,

1442
01:18:31.751 --> 01:18:35.170
you'll get around quickly and safely.
That's right.

1443
01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:38.650
Lift is dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's.

1444
01:18:38.651 --> 01:18:42.070
Dude lifts are rated after every dried,

1445
01:18:42.071 --> 01:18:44.230
so only the best ones stick around.

1446
01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:48.750
You don't have to worry about getting to a filthy car with some creepy dude.

1447
01:18:48.751 --> 01:18:51.100
Meann.
With Lyft,
you can tip in the APP,

1448
01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:54.070
which is obviously leads to happier drivers.

1449
01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:59.200
Nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating from the passenger.

1450
01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:03.490
It's just a better overall experience.
Bigger isn't always better.

1451
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:06.100
Lift isn't the biggest ride sharing app,

1452
01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.160
but it's the fastest growing and highest rated one.

1453
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:13.930
I'm talking about quality over quantity.
People,
you know,

1454
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:17.830
it's like he got that roommate,
he's out there at bang and a bunch of threes,

1455
01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:21.760
right?
He's in the triple digits,
but you're,
you're,

1456
01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:24.370
you're banging sevens,
eights,

1457
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:28.330
occasional nine and every once in a while you get a 10.
You know,

1458
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.310
sky's hitting singles,
spraying them all over the field.
But you're,
you,

1459
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:36.640
you're going fucking yard every once in a while,
right?
Yay.

1460
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:41.320
Yay.
And then into the triangle at Fenway park,
getting that triple you get,

1461
01:19:41.321 --> 01:19:45.790
you get double softer,
the fucking monster.
Um,
thanks to the lift,

1462
01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.010
you got an easy way to avoid drunk driving.

1463
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.070
You never have to burn a ride and you never have to worry about parking.

1464
01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.690
A lot of people are actually getting rid of their cars and relying on Lyft to

1465
01:19:55.691 --> 01:20:00.400
get around.
You know what?
I don't blame them.
Evidently I do blame them.

1466
01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:03.580
You never want to go to the countryside.
You dumb.
Fuck right now.

1467
01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:06.250

All right.
D s t l d genes.

1477
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.840
That's the longest,
most complicated name ever for a pair of fucking genes.

1478
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:50.670
The problem with jeans is that they're really good pairs cost between two and

1479
01:20:50.671 --> 01:20:55.410
300 bucks to have you hug your fucking ball big there easily.

1480
01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:58.800
And the bargain brands just fall apart and look terrible.

1481
01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:01.710
Those are the gap ones where you've got all those red next to in the line

1482

they're broads,
they,

1483
01:21:04.461 --> 01:21:07.710
they haven't led them out of the house yet.
They're just making pies and shit.

1484
01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:11.130
They walked from the stove to the fucking silt.
That's it.
All right.

1485
01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:15.540
D s Tld pronounced distilled.
Okay.
I didn't know that.

1486
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.260
Has Revolutionize,
revolutionize.

1487
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:22.590
Can you tell him like fucking three tequilas and this is like fucking like nine

1488
01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:23.760
hours past the podcast.

1489
01:21:23.761 --> 01:21:28.761
I didn't realize how to do this shit has revolutionized the fashion industry by

1490
01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:32.790
creating timeless luxury grade denim.

1491
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.860
I didn't know there was such a thing.

1492
01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:40.010
So you get genes that would cost you hundreds of dollars starting a at 65 bucks.

1493
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:44.700
Oh,
I know what you're saying.
It's like diesel jeans except as 65 bucks.

1494
01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:49.170
Hey everybody.
How do they do it?
How does that work?
Mia,

1495
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.340
by refusing to work with department stores in retail middlemen,

1496
01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:57.960
there's no markup,
no bullshit,
just great jeans at unbelievable prices.

1497
01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:03.230
Just go to distill.com d s t l d.com find the perfect pair with the perfect fit

1498
01:22:04.841 --> 01:22:09.841

1499
01:22:10.201 --> 01:22:11.250
your spirits high.

1500
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.520
They'll ship them to you for free and guarantee the fit or we'll send you a new

1501
01:22:17.581 --> 01:22:19.800
pair till they are perfect.

1502
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:25.520
See for yourself why a list celebrities had been spotted in magazines like vogue

1503
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:28.380
and doubt.
Fuck that whole sentence.
They got paid to do it.

1504
01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:32.040
They're not going to a podcast to find out where they get their genes that are

1505
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:36.060
out there.
There a list.
Celebrities,
they get genes helicoptered in.

1506
01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:40.950
Even seedless celebrities like me.
Why?

1507
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:44.310
Why did you write that shit?
What am I fucking,

1508
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:48.330
Kathy Griffin went the Dick.
I have a little more self esteem than that.

1509
01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:52.920
I got a pair of raw denim.
No I don't and it fits amazing.
I've never put them on.

1510
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:54.030
This still does.

1511
01:22:54.031 --> 01:22:57.930
The only place in the u s you can get the weight of denim for this price.

1512
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.120
Now what the natural indigo look,
they,

1513
01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.150
they're going to fade beautifully and last for years.

1514
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:05.470
Independent in defense of these fucking people.

1515
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:07.780
These fucking people who advertise,

1516
01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:11.710
they always ask the podcast or can we send you some free shit?
And I always say,

1517
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:14.920
no,
I don't want the shit.
So they gave me the copy,

1518
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:18.000
like they gave me the jeans and I walked around them and said,
Ooh,

1519
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.630
my balls feels tremendous.
I have enough jeans.

1520
01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.110
I'm a sweat pants guy.
You know what I mean?
I don't want to work.

1521
01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:27.970
I like my balls dangling in the wind.

1522
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.260
I like thinking about nothing and I like boozing anyways,
but,

1523
01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:39.680
but you don't need to be a celebrity or I have a stylist or even pay $100 to

1524
01:23:39.901 --> 01:23:42.990
look at it.
Amazing.
Distilled starts at 65 bucks.

1525
01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:48.690
Half of how you look is how your pants fit,

That doesn't mean your special though.

1535

I don't want to fucking rain on your parade,
but what?

What are you doing with the special face?
I've never seen anybody look like you.

1537
01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:36.140
What are you doing with that face?
Let's get back to the copy.

1538
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:40.050
You don't walk like everyone else talk like everyone else or sleep like anyone

1539
01:24:40.051 --> 01:24:40.520
else.

1540
01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:45.520
So why is your mattress man one size fits all?
