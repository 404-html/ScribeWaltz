00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.140
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn it's time for the Monday morning podcast for a

2
00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:10.141
Monday fucking and match 12th March 12th.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.950
The very important day of the history of Barch.
That was the day

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.780
that was the first day slash ever wore a top hat on stage or was it Abraham

5
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.683
Lincoln?

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460
What would you say that those are the most famous people who ever wore a top
hat.

7
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.323
Right.

8
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.920
<v 1>Got It.
Lincoln just get shot while he was wearing one.</v>

10
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:35.720
So that's how everybody always draws him.

11
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.650
<v 2>Um,
I dunno,
I feel like you gotta be a certain height.
That's,</v>

12
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.440
that's tall people shit,
you know,
to have a fucking top hat and tails,

13
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.233
you know?

14
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.200
Is there anything funnier than seeing somebody short wearing tall people?
Shit.

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.420
You know,
like when you went to your prom,
that fucking little fucking five foot,

16
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.320
six inch fireplug showing up,
wearing the fucking tails

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.640
<v 1>look like a little God damn penguin.
Um,</v>

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.310
do people even wear tails that even have prompts anymore?

19
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.780
Is it considered unsafe?

20
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.230
I know that they're supervised and that they started to fucking book Comedians

21
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:18.530
at them.
And now who's kidding?
Who?
I guess they always should have been,

22
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.380
especially if you have a dog.

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.020
<v 0>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.340
<v 1>Speak in a ladies and ladies,</v>

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.180
ladies get in for free.
Um,

26
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.720
they never talk about that when they talk about equal pay.
Huh?
Ladies' night.

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.150
Leave your money at home and bring your snatch cause you're not paying for shit.

28
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.150
Right.
They don't talk about that through that.
All the nightclubs,

29
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.960
they get in for free,
for free.
Um,

30
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.360
actually what they really mean,
don't they really mean beautiful women,

31
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.640
<v 2>beautiful women.
Get it for free,
you know,</v>

32
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.650
<v 1>mediocre to ugly women.
Then they just start going like,
hey,
you know,
we're uh,</v>

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.660
we're kind of full right now.

34
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.440
And what does that do?
That causes of movement.

35
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.780
I went to a club the other night and they said it was full and there wasn't,

36
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.090
you know,
I know that because all of a sudden these other women who yeah,

37
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:18.140
they were skinnier.
Yeah.
They had better bone structure.
Yeah.

38
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:22.130
They were better looking at it.
They wouldn't lend me and they let them in.
Yeah.

39
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.973
This isn't right.

40
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.333
<v 0>MMM.</v>

41
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.020
<v 1>What do people who aren't good looking just go to admit that they're not good</v>

42
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:31.750
looking and just realize that they're going to have to walk through another door

43
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:36.430
in life.
It makes you stronger.
You know,
I'd love to have sympathy for you,

44
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:40.120
but I'm a bald,
redheaded mail,
so I mean,
you fucking preaching to the choir.

45
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.563
<v 0>You know,</v>

46
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.550
<v 1>you think the club wasn't full when I showed up.</v>

47
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.720
Well,
will make me my own room.

48
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.143
<v 0>Wow.</v>

49
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.080
<v 1>It's just the fucking poor me era of human beings is we ignore a real,</v>

50
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.030
real,
real

51
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.960
<v 2>shit,
real shit that's going on.
What kind of real shit is going on,
Bill?</v>

52
00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:05.670
I don't know.
I don't pay attention.

53
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.110
I know there's gotta be something more important than fucking bathrooms,

54
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.860
right?
We already got bathrooms.
Pick one.

55
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.780
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.203
<v 3>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.520
<v 2>Anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.870
You're probably wondering why I'm in such a weird fucked up movie.

59
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.390
I'm really not in a weird phone.
I'm in a good mood.
This is me in a good mood.

60
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.880
I cleaned up my office,
finally,

61
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.070
finally put things in their proper place.
Um,

62
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.610
found a lot of shit that I thought I lost or misplaced or even forgot that I

63
00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:48.620
even had.
Now I'm a minimalist will be like,
well,

64
00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:51.230
that's sense what you need to get.
You need to get rid of all this.

65
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.930
You to get real low as it is.
Where does it go?
They're minimalist.

66
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

67
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.740
<v 2>Into the ocean.
Into a fucking dump.
Okay.</v>

68
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.290
Stop acting like every fucking post that you have out there.

69
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.590
You're going to go sell on craigslist and someone's going to want to buy it.

70
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.683
Okay.

71
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.860
Isn't it more environmentally sound to be a hoarder

72
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.300
rather than sending all your shit to the dump?
Poisoning the soil.

73
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:20.320
You have it contained within your own apartment or house

74
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.430
or a or or Cabana Oak guesthouse,

75
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.500
depending on your living situation.

76
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.863
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.940
<v 2>You can't tell me ever since Oj that when you're in a guest house,
you can't.</v>

78
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.430
You can't be the guest and think,

79
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.500
what if the fucking person who owns this kills their spouse and somebody else

80
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:43.450
who happened to be there?
Wait,

81
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.750
am I going to be the person who happens to be there?
All right.

82
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.030
Note to self the entire time.
I'm a guest

83
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.220
in this guy's house.
Just make sure I'm always wearing,
supposed to be,

84
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.410
how will I know where I'm supposed to be?

85
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.530
I'm just going to avoid this fucking guy and pay the rent on time.

86
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.960
That's what Oj did.
I have a lot of people talk about the bad that he did.
Okay.

87
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.530
Which is pretty obvious at this point.
Um,

88
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.940
<v 3>yeah,</v>

89
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.300
<v 2>but the good that he did is I think the behavior of people in guest houses.</v>

90
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.670
I bet if you were able to chart it,

91
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.350
if you've got an algorithm or whatever is these number crunching,

92
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.560
crunching people do,

93
00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:26.561
they would find that the behavior of the Keto Caitlin's of the world

94
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.340
dramatically improved after Oj,
you know?

95
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.710
<v 3>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.250
<v 2>Well I guess you can't say killed those two people.
He was acquitted.
Um,</v>

97
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.480
it's fucked up.
How the fuck you supposed to say that?
I,
you know,
I don't,

98
00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:46.130
I think I just talked myself into a corner.

99
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:48.860
Look at the bird then I fucking burnt out there.

100
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.053
<v 3>Okay.</v>

101
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.100
<v 2>You know,
a lot of,
you know,
I'm just sitting there looking at that fucking thing.</v>

102
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.180
How that fat fuck that bird just flew the way it just did.

103
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.340
I think it's all about the legs,
I think.
Yeah.
You know,

104
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.230
I bet if you got a fucking really skinny person,
right?

105
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.140
Had a beer belly and they had little bird legs.

106
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.683
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.660
<v 2>Nah,
I still wouldn't work would it?
You know what?</v>

108
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.840
I bet you could get them to try if you talked to him long enough.

109
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.370
If you talk to him long enough,
you know,
C'mon Dude,
look at he,

110
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.640
you shaped just like a burden and you're smarter than that fucking thing.

111
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.220
Give it a jump.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Anyway,

112
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.540
so this is Sunday afternoon.
Uh,

113
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.590
I just put my absolutely darling daughter in the other room for a nap,

114
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:44.300
so I got the fucking big brother camera going here.
Where the fuck is it?

115
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.310
A Shit with a flux.
The camera.
God dammit.
I just fucking had this thing.

116
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:53.240
I was killing it.
I had everything going the way I needed it to be going.
Oh,

117
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:56.420
there it is.
There it is.
What is she doing?
Oh,

118
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.940
she's sleeping Rocca by Qd and the other room

119
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.450
something someday.
Then I'll get a broom,

120
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.850
clean up all the shit that fell on the floor,

121
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.940
and then you'll come out and deal with some more.
Oh,
dad,

122
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.020
can you stop singing your nerd songs?
Um,

123
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.380
anyways,
uh,
you know,

124
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:22.220
it's fucking amazing is I'm getting my Invisalign off,

125
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.420
allegedly just like Oj,
allegedly.
I'm getting my Invisalign off this Wednesday.

126
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.780
I can't fucking wait.
I'm on train number 13.

127
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:33.770
It was projected to take 16 weeks,
but I had these fuckers in the whole time.

128
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.620
I did my half on my stand up sets.

129
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:40.220
I left them in spitting all over the fucking stage.

130
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.790
I just wanted to get it over with.

131
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.343
<v 0>Right.</v>

132
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.360
<v 2>That's a big thing in life when they would,
something sucks.</v>

133
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:52.710
You just get it over with.
Kay.

134
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.360
You get tossed overboard in the ocean.
You know what I mean?

135
00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:58.640
You see that shark fin.
Don't swim away from it.

136
00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:02.450
You swim at it head first,
get it over with it.

137
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.810
What do you say that show gain?
Um,
anyways,

138
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:15.310
I'm getting my Invisalign off and then they give me a mouth Gad.

139
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.400
Uh,
so for the rest of my life when I go to sleep,

140
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:22.760
I just popped in the mouth guard and then I'm fine and the ship will stay the

141
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:23.594
same.

142
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.910
<v 0>And uh,</v>

143
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.750
<v 2>and it's also cool because,
you know,</v>

144
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.230
occasionally I will grind my teeth at night because I'm a lunatic or I'm

145
00:08:31.231 --> 00:08:33.780
stressed.
I don't know what it is,

146
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.370
but it's something I've done ever since I was a little kid.
Um,

147
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:39.990
so anyway,

148
00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:43.500
so it all worked out and I'll fuck a worked out and I highly recommended and

149
00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:46.800
they're not paying me to tell you guys that fucking Invisalign is the shit.

150
00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:50.850
But uh,
it's the shit,
you know,
considering what they used to do,

151
00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:54.240
put all that Barb wire and you fucking mouth,
you know,

152
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.130
then God forbid you got into a fight.
It was just like you were a fucking bleed.

153
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.490
All someone to do is just punch you right in the mouth.
I would playing,

154
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.530
we were playing killed a man with them,
not kill them out with the ball.

155
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.190
That's what we used to call that game.

156
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.970
You just pick up the football and start running and the other half your grade

157
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:15.360
would tackle you and then you just coughed it up and someone else got it.

158
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:19.740
It was fucking great and played a toll.
We played it everyday.
Outdoor recess,

159
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:21.900
just a button you come in,
you when you weren't even sore,

160
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.160
your body was brand new.
He had a big puffy coat on.

161
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:30.360
That's all you needed.
Um,
so we were playing football one time and uh,

162
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.280
it was right around the time,
you know,

163
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.340
junior high when kids started getting braces.
And I remember this Kid Sean,

164
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.400
he got somehow hit in the mouth and when he got up like the wires that go from

165
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.610
like,
you know,
you know the,
each tooth they had like a,

166
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:49.630
like a little fucking central hub where the wires would go through and like the

167
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.520
thing had like popped off,
the wired popped off.
Those things are still glued on.

168
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:56.760
That's right.
And he had like two wires sticking straight out of his mouth

169
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.160
and maybe even getting up,
like making this weird noise and he was bleeding.

170
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:06.640
And then we all just standing there like,
ah,
somebody get applied.

171
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.880
Um,
but now they got Invisalign and it's tremendous.

172
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.860
And you two and 13,

173
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:16.800
well it depends on how fucked up your teeth are and how much you're willing to

174
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:20.970
wear them because I know somebody else that's getting them and doesn't want to

175
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:24.600
wear them all the time.
So she's given into the fact that it's going to take,

176
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.930
you know,
like a year and a half or some shit.
And now it's just like,

177
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.790
why wouldn't you get it over with?
And she was just like,

178
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.720
why wouldn't you just fuck off?
And I was like,
fine.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

179
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.610
Who am I to tell you
how to fix your fucking dentition?
All right.

180
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:43.170
I'm just,
you know,
I'm excited.
I want other people to be excited.

181
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.230
Hey,
his son to be excited about,
I finally watched,

182
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:51.170
I watched two Bruins games this weekend.
Yeah,
it,
Eh,

183
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.640
I finally saw Rick Nash Plan with the Bruins spake physical presence,

184
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.690
scored a goal on a Saturday.
Now matinee game,

185
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:03.840
those games usually suck,
right?
Cause if fucking teams tired,

186
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:04.710
they're just waken up.

187
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:08.220
They used to like sh there's still shaken off a hangover and all of a sudden

188
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:12.000
that dropping the puck is a bunch of kids there and shit.
It feels like,

189
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.830
it feels like a charity game,
you know,
it doesn't feel like the season.
Uh,

190
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.150
but they played a wild one on Saturday,
seven to four.
They won.

191
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.650
They were up two to nothing looking like it was going to be nice smooth fucking

192
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:26.610
time.
And then,
uh,
the hawks gave a seal right there,
Fred.
Then it was two to two.

193
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.830
I came out with three,
two,
three,
three,
four,
three,
four,
four,
five,
four,
six,
four,

194
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:35.850
seven,
four.
Right.
I think that's what it was.
And then today,
like to fucking,

195
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.920
you know,
I thought we were going to a,

196
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.800
we tied it up and thought we had the goddamn thing one.
And then shower law.

197
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.840
I know the Patrick Sharp took a stick to the face of Charisse and we'd get a

198
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:49.350
shower in the box for four minute fucking major for the rest of the Goddamn
game.

199
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.260
Right.
A double minor I should say.
And then,
uh,

200
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.490
of course they go out there and the fucking,

201
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.960
it reminds me when we lost the Stanley Cup to him,
but we were like,
oh,

202
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:03.310
there is going to be a game seven now there isn't,
it's over.

203
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.260
Um,
they did that fucking Patrick Kane,
Jesus Christ,

204
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.960
guises sniper.
Um,

205
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:14.380
so I'm going to try to watch some more of the gains,

206
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:17.110
but I mean I've watched so many fucking games in the last 10 years,

207
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:20.470
so it didn't feel like I was away that long and I still knew most of the team

208
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:24.160
cause I've been watching,
uh,
looking at the stats and all of that shit.

209
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.290
Um,
so I dunno,
I guess I'll try it.
I don't know what we're not,

210
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.390
and I got the kid,
man.
It's just,
it's fucking hard,
man.

211
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:32.920
I haven't been able to watch my Celtics.

212
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:37.060
My Bruins patriots are easy cause it's like once a week,

213
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.230
you know.
So,
um,
anyways,
I'm just fucking,

214
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.140
I'm meandering right now because I'm waiting for the,
uh,

215
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.580
all the reeds and all that bullshit to come in because there's always,

216
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:52.600
I have 50,000 fucking things I have to do today.
Even on a Sunday.

217
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.310
This is a day arrest.
Even God rested on Sunday.

218
00:12:57.311 --> 00:13:01.870
I'm working harder than God people.
Um,
I shouldn't have said that.
You know,

219
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.930
this fucking person sent me this,
this,
I don't know,

220
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.260
this fucking thing with this guy was convinced that I was possessed by Satan and

221
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:13.690
his eye for cinematography was incredible.

222
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.570
The way he was breaking down something that he did.

223
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:19.120
He got every fucking thing that we would doing right.

224
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:23.260
He just had the motivation rock.
He was like,
this is hypnotic.

225
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.470
They're trying to hit the Taj here.
It was all the serve Satan.
And it's like,
no,

226
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.810
it's not the serve Satan.
It's so I could sell tickets.

227
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.840
The reason why there's no crowd shots is because I feel your brain resets every

228
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:36.340
time they cut to the fucking crowd,

229
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:37.990
and then you've got to try to draw him in again.

230
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.720
When you go to a fucking standup show,

231
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.470
you're not looking at the comedian and then turning around and looking at people

232
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:48.580
laughing every fucking eight seconds.
That would be a shitty experience.

233
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:51.070
So I'm trying to recreate the live experience.
That's all I'm doing.

234
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.010
I'm not trying to serve,
uh,
you know,

235
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.900
the guy down under all right.
With my standup special,

236
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.990
I do that effortlessly the way I live my life anyways.
Um,

237
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.560
but it's fucking this youtube video.
This guy's comparing like fucking,
he goes,

238
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:09.570
look at the [inaudible] x.

239
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.000
So kind they use black and white and they fucking do all this shit was really a,

240
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.130
it was really insane.
Um,

241
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:21.390
my favorite part was when he told his kid and knock it off.
I'm like,

242
00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:25.350
all right,
he's a good dad.
Hey,
knock it off.
Um,

243
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.700
but yeah,
uh,
anyways,
you're going to get that right.

244
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.150
I guess if you put a fucking special out,

245
00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:34.450
you're going to get some shit like that.

246
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.870
Who gives a fuck about my standup specials?
You know,
it was awesome.

247
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:40.060
Last night I stayed in with my lovely,
beautiful,

248
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:44.010
gorgeous wife and we hung in and,
uh,

249
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.310
I started to watch peaky blinders and you don't know nothing about no robbery.

250
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.390
Right?
She's like,
I don't want to watch this every bill,
you're wide enough.

251
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.870
I have a difficult time,
enough understanding.

252
00:14:55.871 --> 00:15:00.430
You forget about these fucking people.
Right.
So I was like,
okay,
fair enough.

253
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.990
So then we were scrolling through and,
uh,
I look for the nice guys once again,

254
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:06.521
Netflix.

255
00:15:06.521 --> 00:15:11.521
Can you make my year and get the Nice guys starring Russell Crowe and,

256
00:15:12.521 --> 00:15:15.940
um,
God,
Jesus.
Wow.
How can I forget this guy's name?

257
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.430
The guy from drive,
the guy from la La land.

258
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.350
I'll remember it later.
I always

259
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.120
the fuck is his name.
He's fucking hilarious in that movie too.
You know.

260
00:15:33.121 --> 00:15:35.970
Fuck this.
Hang on a second.
I'm going to hit pause.
I to get this guy's name,

261
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.200
sorry.
Ryan Gosling.

262
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.210
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

263
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:45.260
<v 2>they're fucking hilarious in that move.
Ryan Gosling's hilarious.</v>

264
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.520
But also Cora was hilarious.

265
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:50.930
It's such an underrated comedy and it reminds me of one of my favorite comedies

266
00:15:50.931 --> 00:15:55.160
of all time,
midnight run as far as I feel like the comedy,
so much of it,

267
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:57.170
their reactions and the way they're doing things,
it's,

268
00:15:57.171 --> 00:16:00.770
it comes from a real place.
I don't mind Wacky,

269
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:03.260
I don't mind absurd or any of that bullshit,
but,
uh,

270
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.800
I fucking love that movie and I'm so I looked it up and for whatever reason,

271
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:15.101
Netflix has every fucking movie just about on this streaming surface,

272
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.870
the biggest streaming service in the world,
world world world.
Right.

273
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.480
But they don't have that one.
So I'm like,
fuck.

274
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.920
And we scrolled down and then they had Fellman Luis and I was just like,
man,

275
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.431
I am not,

276
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:33.431
I literally not seen that movie since I saw it when it came out in the movies.

277
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.670
And uh,
oh,
is that a great fucking movie?

278
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

279
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.730
<v 2>Fucking great God damn movie.
And it still holds up.
And now with all this,</v>

280
00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:46.960
me too.
Shit,
you watch it now and it,
it's,

281
00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:49.940
it's more relevant than ever.

282
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.260
And every guy in there was just this piece of shit hitting on him.

283
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:58.130
Like the guy who plays Gina Davis has a husband,

284
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.590
Christopher McDonald,
he fought,
he fucking steals every scene that he's in.

285
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.093
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

286
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.100
<v 2>you got to,
you got to watch it again.
What did they tell him?</v>

287
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:14.860
That his wife might be involved in her murder,
murder.
He just goes,
what?

288
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.480
W
what?
Just the way he does.
I'm going to be,
I'm butchering it.

289
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:25.340
He's fucking hilarious in that movie.
And uh,
we watched an aroma in the end,

290
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:28.460
you know,
I don't want to ruin the ending for people who haven't seen it,
but uh,

291
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.870
you know,
anything that you know is a little nod to vanishing point.

292
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.330
You got to love that.
Have you ever seen vanishing point?

293
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.250
That's one of the first like anti hero.
It was during that,
not the first,

294
00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:43.190
but during that era of the anti hero,
like up until then,

295
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.990
I guess with movies and Shit,
it was always like,
you know,

296
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.130
the guy with white hat and who's kidding who the white skin was always like the

297
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:56.370
fucking hero.
He was always trying to do the right thing.
He didn't rob,

298
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:58.290
he didn't steal and he was a fucking hero.

299
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.250
And if you stole and you were a piece of shit,
uh,

300
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.580
you are the black cat,
you were the bad guy.
You know what I mean?

301
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.540
I would say that they'd put minorities in those roles.
But way back then,

302
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:11.120
I didn't think they did that.
They just had like,

303
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:16.020
they even had white people playing like native Americans and Asians,

304
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:16.923
even Asians.

305
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.260
I remember that when I posted that thing from fucking Hawaii five o and they had

306
00:18:22.261 --> 00:18:25.340
that fucking white dude and they did some that was eyes to try to make him look.

307
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.740
He just looked weird.
Um,

308
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.220
which was really strange because they had all those,

309
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.810
I don't know if they will hope Asian Hawaiian on what the fuck they were,

310
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:39.180
but I mean they had plenty of people who weren't white on that show.

311
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.450
I don't know.
It didn't make any sense.
But anyways,

312
00:18:43.451 --> 00:18:47.190
you've got to love Jack Lawrence Mercury Marquee.
Um,
I liked the first one.

313
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:51.180
They'd had the 67 that he had or the 66.

314
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:54.390
That was a mean fucking looking car.
Um,
anyways,

315
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:58.950
but we sat and we watched that movie and uh,
it's still,

316
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:03.780
it's just still holds up.
It's still fucking holds up.

317
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.900
This is a time when usually I would start doing some reads,

318
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.090
but I don't fucking have any
filming my reads Jesus.
Bill.

319
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.600
Why would you make such a bad fucking joke?
You know,

320
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:17.610
I can't even sign into my fucking Gmail right now.

321
00:19:17.611 --> 00:19:21.000
I don't know what the problem is.
Oh,
Instagram instinct.

322
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:23.130
I'm inching closer to getting on Instagram.

323
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.670
I figured out what my password is and now they're like,

324
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:30.410
God has been too many fucked up attempts to get into your account.
I'm like,

325
00:19:30.411 --> 00:19:32.670
all right,
that was me.
But there's nobody to say that too.

326
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:36.390
So they go in and send this fucking code to you and then they never sent it.

327
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.410
Well,
who's kid who they send me something back in September and I never fucking

328
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:45.150
responded.
So now I think they're looking at my,
uh,
you know,
my account,

329
00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:48.330
like it's fucked up or some shit.
I have no idea.
But anyways,

330
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:54.810
who gives a shit enough about that?
Um,
oh,
so thank you to everybody who,
uh,

331
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.190
who came out to my shows of Vancouver,
Jesus Christ and I have a good time.

332
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.250
I had such a fucking great time,
uh,
performing up there,

333
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.900
such a beautiful city and all that.
And um,

334
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.430
this woman started running down to the stage.

335
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.480
She was yelling something about how lesbians were better at something and I was

336
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:19.110
just like,
why do I don't know what you're talking about and you know,

337
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:21.900
and I was being an asshole,
you know,
make it fun of all that and me to shit.

338
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.830
You know,
just,
you know,
feminists that you did just so easy to get mad.

339
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.460
How do you not do it?
It's just so fucking tempting as a comic.

340
00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:34.461
So I'm up to it just saying this fucking ridiculous ignorant shit and

341
00:20:34.471 --> 00:20:36.870
everybody's laughing,
including all the rest of the women there.

342
00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:39.390
Cause he know what I'm saying is so fucking ridiculous.
They know.

343
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:44.070
I don't believe it.
Right.
But nowadays there's,
there's always the,
uh,

344
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:46.710
you know,
Franny face value in the fucking crowd,
right?

345
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.810
You've got to fucking take everything.
Like,
did he mean,
now I'm offended,

346
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.980
now I'm offended.
So I dunno what the fuck she was doing.

347
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:58.690
She started like marching down towards the stage and all this security cave and

348
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:00.220
just got her in a way.
And next note.

349
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.260
Next thing I knew she was being escorted out,

350
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.710
which sucked because that meant the fun was over a curb.

351
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.490
I heard people,
People's guides of preds and came out to the show.

352
00:21:09.491 --> 00:21:12.490
They were trying to just people walking out saying that she was a plant.

353
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.150
That was funny.
Is that

354
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.240
like I got that kind of time and money to fly an actor up to fucking Vancouver

355
00:21:22.241 --> 00:21:23.260
to interrupt my show.

356
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:26.500
It's just like at that point when I just hired somebody to write me better

357
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:30.960
material,
um,
who knows?
I don't fuck,

358
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.580
I have no idea.
I don't know why people always think that

359
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:40.540
that's such an old show Biz thing to have a plant in the crowd.

360
00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:46.880
But people used to do it.
They did used to do it.
So I guess it's fair that they,

361
00:21:46.881 --> 00:21:49.700
that they,
uh,
that they think that.
But anyways,
so she got kicked out.

362
00:21:49.701 --> 00:21:51.740
I never kick anybody out on the show and it wasn't my call either.

363
00:21:51.741 --> 00:21:54.210
They just fucking escorted her out.
Um,

364
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.220
which I thought was funny after,
I mean,
I kind of felt bad.
I was like,

365
00:21:58.221 --> 00:22:01.310
well that's,
you know,
we've been fun.
If she stuck around,
I could hear it.

366
00:22:01.311 --> 00:22:06.210
Some more of a fucking crazy theories,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't,

367
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.510
there's this,
and I had,

368
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.390
I had another two women walked out on my show when I was down in the Improv.

369
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.720
Now if I was some sort of thinking man,
it would be like,
well,
hey bill,

370
00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:18.370
that's two incidents the one week,
maybe it's shoe.
But you know,

371
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.620
I really don't think it is.
I just think that the,
uh,

372
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.830
the extreme left
are,

373
00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:29.160
are out of their fucking minds now.
And they have this thing where if you,

374
00:22:29.161 --> 00:22:30.680
if that the,

375
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.800
there's only one way to think and it's their way and there's only certain

376
00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:36.210
subjects you can joke about.

377
00:22:36.211 --> 00:22:39.570
And if they don't think that you should be joking about it,
that they're,

378
00:22:39.571 --> 00:22:42.930
they're just gonna really just behave like children

379
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.800
was funny when they got up and walked out when I was at the Improv,

380
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:51.040
like people were going to care.
Um,

381
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.730
I dunno.
Hey,
you know what?
You know what?

382
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:56.650
It's just the world that we're living in,
Huh?

383
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:02.050
Just as overly sensitive fucking time that we live in.
And so anyways,
uh,

384
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.780
<v 3>okay,</v>

385
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.740
<v 2>the fuck am I going to get these reeds 80 just see Trump is going to go talk to</v>

386
00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:10.710
Kim Jong.
They're going gonna go hang out.

387
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.860
So I actually looked up the fucking story,
right?

388
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.100
I looked at story and we see if I can find this shit.

389
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.480
And my first thought when I saw that picture side decide is like,

390
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.070
you know,
Trump gets way too much shit for his fucking hair.

391
00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:29.670
Do the picture they have on the Google news is,
hey,
it looks good to me.

392
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.090
You know,
I think it was bad for a long time where he had,

393
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.470
he did have a comb over,

394
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.010
but since then hair plugs got way better and I think he filled it in,

395
00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.940
but he likes having the big swooping thing cause I think that's part of his
look.

396
00:23:41.941 --> 00:23:45.410
But I think that's all his hair but whatever.

397
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:49.400
But Kim Jong UN's haircut.
How in the fuck you say,

398
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.170
Jesus Christ,
I don't want to sabotage this meeting,
but my God,

399
00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.130
he has like a Joseph Stalin meets Moe Howard with a little bit of John Travolta.

400
00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:05.980
All in the same,

401
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.130
<v 3>yeah,</v>

402
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.420
<v 2>all in the same fucking</v>

403
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.040
<v 3>okay.</v>

404
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.700
<v 2>Haircut.
It's incredible.
Really?
Yes.</v>

405
00:24:14.701 --> 00:24:17.520
It's like the kind of haircut like a wrestler.
You know,

406
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.600
what have they wanted to make a splash?
Like,
oh my God,
who the fuck is this guy?

407
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.310
Um,
but anyways,
isn't it?

408
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:29.190
You mentioned the balls and me just sitting here and fucking completely bald.

409
00:24:29.191 --> 00:24:32.020
Sitting there trash in these people's haircuts.
I gave Trump a naughty,

410
00:24:32.021 --> 00:24:34.410
that nautical or Septra compared to what?

411
00:24:34.411 --> 00:24:36.120
Compared to what I'm fucking dealing with,
I guess.

412
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:41.060
Although I think I look better than a,
Hey,

413
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.970
well let's do that.
Let's do that on the Photoshop.
You know,
when they go,

414
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:46.790
who wore it best,
you know,

415
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.220
do a fucking Trump,
me and Kim Jong Un and just vote worst haircut

416
00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.270
and fuck all you assholes.
Who picked me just to be cunt.
I respect it,

417
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:01.400
but fuck you too.
All right.
CIA Director,

418
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.260
Mike Pompeo has defended Donald Trump's decision to meet North Korean leader.

419
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:10.340
Kim Jong saying the president understands the risk.
Uh,

420
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.220
I actually think it's fucking great that he's doing this.

421
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.590
This should happen more.
Go talk it out before a bunch of people fucking die.

422
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:20.240
You're lunatics.
He said,
Mr. Trump isn't doing this for theater.

423
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.420
He's going there to solve a problem despite chief told a Fox News Sunday.

424
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.070
Uh,
it's funny that he's a spa,
a spa,
a spy,
and he's going on the fucking news.

425
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:36.020
The president has said the summit could produce the greatest deal for the world.

426
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.850
What else do what he say?

427
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:41.960
He's been saying that that's how it got him in the office.
Everything's great,

428
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.890
but critics have warned that it's a tops tog scope.
Poorly.

429
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:50.680
The two nations will be in a worse position than before.
Uh,
the,

430
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:55.070
it's the political gamble of the 21st century that the tricky task of preparing

431
00:25:55.071 --> 00:25:58.160
for the Trump Kim summit.
Why is everybody so like,

432
00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.740
why is it better if that the two of them don't talk?

433
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.220
Says no sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader.

434
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.040
Mr. Trump reportedly accepted the offer to do so on the spot when it was really

435
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.340
relayed by South Korea,
South Korean envoys on Thursday,

436
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.420
taking his own administration by surprise.
Let me ask you this,

437
00:26:19.421 --> 00:26:22.180
please tell me they're not going to meet some fucking Italian restaurant in the

438
00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:23.980
village.
Okay.

439
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.780
And if any point Kim Jones says,
I need to go to the bathroom.

440
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.930
All right,
you better.
You better have something down by your ankles.

441
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.370
That's all I'm saying.
Um,
anyways,

442
00:26:36.371 --> 00:26:41.371
attempts to negotiate aid for just disarmament deals have failed repeatedly

443
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:44.040
since 2003 when the north pulled

444
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.950
<v 1>out of the nuclear non proliferation treaty.</v>

445
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.610
Mr Pavio told CBSC administration had it's eyes wide open to the challenge of

446
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:56.370
dealing with North Korea.
Um,
I gotta be honest with you,

447
00:26:56.371 --> 00:26:58.440
I don't understand what the fucking problem is.

448
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

449
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.980
<v 1>Like why are there so we have like economic sanctions on them.</v>

450
00:27:02.981 --> 00:27:06.610
Is that why there are people are starving and we have that on them because they

451
00:27:06.611 --> 00:27:10.950
were part of the communist expansion.
You know,

452
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:14.280
there's gotta be a better way to do it.
We gotta,
you know,
economic sanctions.
We,

453
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.810
why don't you go the other way?

454
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.540
Why don't we ever go the other way and just become like the,
the,
the fucking,

455
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.440
you know,
just be like a good shit,
you know,
fight the guy to the Superbowl.

456
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.880
Get him some whores,
you know,
then he,

457
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.010
then he doesn't want to blow this place up.
He,
I can't fucking blow that up.
Yeah,

458
00:27:30.011 --> 00:27:34.080
I bought to the football game.
I got my dick sucked.
Well what are we doing here?

459
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.640
I liked those guys.
Right.
Is that going?

460
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.320
The Bruins in the rangers hated each other and then they all played on the same

461
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:42.870
team and they went and they played the Russians and all of a sudden the rivalry

462
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:45.780
fucking died.
That's what you do.
These people they got,
they got to hang out.

463
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.370
You know,
I don't know how good that will be for the rest of us.

464
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:54.960
Cause then they're probably like joined forces.
I have no fucking idea.
Um,

465
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.360
<v 3>yeah</v>

466
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.680
<v 1>sweat.
Don't read the news.
I mean,
Princess Diana's iconic minefield walk.</v>

467
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:02.940
What the fuck is this about?

468
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

469
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.230
<v 1>How slow news Newsday is it that they're,
they're going to bring this shit up.</v>

470
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.110
I mean then it was like she died to what?
97

471
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.650
Rosa parks before Rosa parks.
There was a 15 year old girl.

472
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

473
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.210
<v 1>From hero to big friend.
Is Bernie Sanders running for president?</v>

474
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:32.610
Five women.
Five countries.
Five babies.
It sounds like a bad movie,
doesn't it?

475
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.920
Demand Brussel can't stop.
Brussels can't stop talking about.

476
00:28:36.921 --> 00:28:40.590
That's the winner right there.
Who's this guy's Brussels.

477
00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:45.450
Can't stop the man at the heart of the Bra Brussels Saga Saga.

478
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.580
I have no idea what this is about.

479
00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:52.230
The European Commission has denied allegations of cronyism after a protege of

480
00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:54.520
its president shown collage junk.

481
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:58.400
NEP was given one of the most powerful jobs in the EU civil service.
He hasn't.

482
00:28:58.401 --> 00:29:01.950
Everybody hooks everybody up in politics.
Mark Martins sell.

483
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:04.890
Mayer has been appointed secretary general,

484
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.520
general of the commission off not Martin.
Satan May.

485
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.500
Mailer sell mayor.

486
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:11.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>

487
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.540
<v 1>The organization that monitors where the countries are sticking to,
he use rules,</v>

488
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.730
dreams up new laws and runs the Brexit talks day to day.

489
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:21.643
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

490
00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.870
<v 1>Who is he?
He's at 40 something low.
Who gives a fuck.
This is why I can't pay.
Who,</v>

491
00:29:25.871 --> 00:29:30.380
who cares?
I don't care.
I actually stopped carrying the middle of that.
Um,

492
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:31.711
all right.

493
00:29:31.711 --> 00:29:34.530
I guess I have to hit pause at this point cause I don't have any my fucking

494
00:29:34.531 --> 00:29:38.400
advertising,
right.
No bullshit wellness.
Can I talk to you about Oh,
you know what,

495
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.340
my fucking shoulder is doing great.
I did yoga for 20

496
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.250
<v 2>minutes before my shoulder was like,
you know,
get a little like,
hey,</v>

497
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.350
take it easy there.
Huh?
Um,

498
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.600
I got weightlifting going again a little bit.
I got to get in shape.
Girls,

499
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:56.530
you know the pink,
Oh my God,
you had a girl,
one pounders.

500
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.600
I got the baby blue fucking five pounders and uh,

501
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:03.550
I don't know.
At some point I'm going to work back up to the iron,

502
00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:07.630
but at this point,
oh my,
uh,
all my weight training.
What's the Shit I grabbed?

503
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:12.460
Looks like it's made out of play dough but a fucking site.

504
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:13.990
Cause I told you guys and you know,
I'm turning 50.

505
00:30:13.991 --> 00:30:16.240
I don't know if I brought that up 50,000 fucking times,

506
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:19.870
but I'm turning 50 in June and uh,
I'm gonna get into the best shape of my life.

507
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.560
That's what I plan on doing a,
that's my plant,
whether I do it or not,

508
00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:27.160
I have no idea.
Not the best shape of my life.
Best shape of my fucking,

509
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.080
like the last 10 years.
Cause matter how good a shape I get in,
you know,

510
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.140
the parts of 50 years old.
Right.
You know,
they was trying to say that shit.

511
00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:37.470
You know,
they used to do that shit when it's just like,
you know,

512
00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:41.040
he did a test set,
you know,
I'm 50,
but my fucking legs of 40.
It's like,
no,
no,

513
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:45.430
they're not.
And those are your,
those are all original parts.
Okay.

514
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.840
Unless you lost a leg and then they stuck a new one on there when you were 10,

515
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:56.080
then that leg would be 40 years old.
The prosthetic.
All right.
That was negative.

516
00:30:56.081 --> 00:31:00.730
All right,
let me,

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.350
haven't,
you know,
they can't fucking ring a doorbell anymore.

705
00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:31.550
They're sitting there,
they're texting you that they're outside of the head.

706
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:36.220
Knock on the fucking door.
Um,
so anyways,

707
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:40.720
I've used it twice.
Same place.
Okay.
The first fucking guy say,

708
00:42:40.721 --> 00:42:44.290
I said I that I live on fucking 9 million,
858

709
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.420
main street,
north main street.
He went to the south main street.

710
00:42:49.421 --> 00:42:53.200
He's just like God,
blah,
blah.
K nine miles from your house,
blah,

711
00:42:53.201 --> 00:42:56.940
let to fog toad Santa.
We talked,
he was actually a good shit.
And I,

712
00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.950
I sat there blaming myself going,
I probably fucked it up.

713
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.360
I just signed up a bottle,

714
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.130
all his fucking shit in it turned out I didn't fuck up.

715
00:43:06.131 --> 00:43:09.970
I put my right set of coping in the day.
They fucked up.
I still tip the guy,

716
00:43:09.971 --> 00:43:12.390
right?
I got to need to be liked.
He was a good guy,
whatever.

717
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.880
So I ordered again,

718
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:20.380
same fucking place and I'm waiting and I'm waiting and then I'm looking and it

719
00:43:20.381 --> 00:43:25.270
says it's going to be here at like six.
And I'm like,
fine,
you know,

720
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:30.010
but I can't negotiate it.
And then fucking,

721
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.430
I dunno,
I hit something and it said,
oops,

722
00:43:33.431 --> 00:43:36.040
it's been a problem you order can't go through.
So I was just like,

723
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:41.041
hey fucking fuck Postmates and all this shit and ate something else.

724
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:46.090
And in the middle of prepping that,
uh,
the doorbell rings and my order came,

725
00:43:46.091 --> 00:43:47.140
so I don't know what I did.

726
00:43:47.141 --> 00:43:51.850
So I apologize to Postmates for all the Shit I just said about him walking

727
00:43:51.851 --> 00:43:55.450
around my house.
Evidently I fucked it up.
I went back to some other screens.

728
00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.250
All I knew was I couldn't tell if I ordered it and had gone through.

729
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.510
<v 0>I don't,
I don't know.</v>

730
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.620
<v 1>Do you know it doesn't take much to fucking,</v>

731
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:08.183
<v 0>you know,</v>

732
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.590
<v 1>sorry,
I'm checking my password.
He can't fucking think and type at the same time.</v>

733
00:44:11.591 --> 00:44:14.560
It doesn't take much to throw me off.
That's all I'm saying.
All right.

734
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.990
So whatever Postmates is fine.
Okay.
All right.

757
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.670
Then I'll be like,
oh,
sorry,
I didn't mean to offend the Queen.

758
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.830
Whatever the fuck I'm supposed to say.

764
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.110
Um,

Wow.
This,

765
00:46:23.111 --> 00:46:27.620
this is going to be a fun year.
It's going to be a fun year.
All right.

766
00:46:27.621 --> 00:46:30.950
Enough with me fucking drooling over all those great places I get to perform at

767
00:46:30.951 --> 00:46:33.770
Boston sports.
Hey,
they had Billy Russell.

768
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:37.850
Do you think Boston is the type of city that could have supported two teams in

769
00:46:37.851 --> 00:46:41.090
any sport?
Do you think it's something you could handle in the future?

770
00:46:41.091 --> 00:46:45.740
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,
well,
we had that opportunity way back in the day.

771
00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:48.980
We had the,
uh,
let's see,
we had the,
uh,

772
00:46:48.981 --> 00:46:52.430
the Boston Braves and the Boston Red Sox,
the Braves ended up leaving.

773
00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:55.440
<v 3>MMM.</v>

774
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.510
<v 1>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I gotta be honest with you.</v>

775
00:46:59.511 --> 00:47:01.850
I don't know how the Brooklyn Nets did it.

776
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.080
<v 3>Okay.</v>

777
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:08.080
<v 1>We're all those people out there with nick fans and then all of a sudden the New</v>

778
00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:08.091
Jersey,

779
00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:11.690
Nick's move out there and it just says Brooklyn and everybody just jumps on the

780
00:47:11.691 --> 00:47:14.570
bandwagon and says,
fuck the Knicks.
I don't get that.

781
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:15.900
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

782
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.570
<v 1>Especially if you're a long time suffering Knicks fan.</v>

783
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.380
And then what if they win it?
You know,

784
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.590
even if the Brooklyn Nets when it,
it's not going to be the same.

785
00:47:27.591 --> 00:47:30.340
You didn't fucking,
they showed during your life,

786
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:34.380
you know,
that's like the second wife.

787
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.400
You don't love her the way you love the first one because the first one went
bad,

788
00:47:38.401 --> 00:47:41.460
I would think.
Right.
I don't know.
Um,

789
00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:45.060
and then of course we had two football teams there for a minute.

790
00:47:45.061 --> 00:47:49.200
We had the New England patriots and we had the Boston breakers in the USFL.

791
00:47:49.201 --> 00:47:52.530
I went to a game against the Washington federals,
that Nickerson Nickerson field.

792
00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.470
I know,
I know.
I don't,
you know,
this is the deal.

793
00:47:55.471 --> 00:48:00.471
We don't need more than one team and every sport the Way New York does to try to

794
00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:05.130
fucking win some championships.
I'm telling you,

795
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:11.010
the fucking New York Yankees or the sugar daddy of New York City,

796
00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:15.420
I,
that's the reason why New York City is not looked upon as one of the most

797
00:48:15.421 --> 00:48:17.700
pathetic fucking sports towns ever.

798
00:48:17.701 --> 00:48:21.690
Just conspired considering the amount of titles versus the amount of fucking

799
00:48:21.691 --> 00:48:23.740
teams.
Um,

800
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.843
<v 3>okay.</v>

801
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.420
<v 1>You know,
the next habit,
one in forever.</v>

802
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:32.230
The Nets have never won the med seven one in 30 something years.

803
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.230
The jets have at one since Superbowl fucking three,

804
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.440
uh,
four wells.
The Knicks,
the Knicks since what 73?

805
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.850
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

806
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:48.850
<v 1>The rangers have won one since 1940 and they're going on a 25 year fucking</v>

807
00:48:50.421 --> 00:48:53.870
drought again.
Uh,
they're about halfway through that fucking curse again already.

808
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:56.990
Just like that.
They went 54 years.
The last time.

809
00:48:56.991 --> 00:49:00.210
They're almost at the halfway point of the,
um,

810
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:07.750
giants.
A decent giants are respectable.
Um,

811
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:12.210
and also they did a bar,
you know,
some giants also want some NFL titles too.
So,

812
00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:16.140
um,
but what kills the fucking city for me,

813
00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.980
aside from my blind hatred of them is the fact that,
you know,

814
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.770
you can just go,
oh,
what about the giants?

815
00:49:22.771 --> 00:49:25.080
Cause you already have the jets so that you don't have to have the jets hanging

816
00:49:25.081 --> 00:49:27.360
around your neck,
out the fucking meds a lot.
What about the Yankees?

817
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:32.710
You know what I mean?
They always have like a fucking option.
Um,
so yeah,
I dunno.

818
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.780
And I gotta be honest with you,

819
00:49:33.781 --> 00:49:38.580
I don't understand how the clippers fucking survive,
but they do.
They do.

820
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.610
Um,
I just don't see that happening in a,

821
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.550
a city like Boston,
the size of it and the,

822
00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:51.480
the ridiculous loyalty that you would bring a new team.

823
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:55.260
Like who the fuck would you bring in there?
I mean,

824
00:49:55.261 --> 00:49:58.380
everybody hates us at this point in everybody's talked shit about us.
So what,

825
00:49:58.381 --> 00:49:59.670
what are you going?
What are you,
who are you gonna move there?

826
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:03.900
The jag was the new England Jag was.

827
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:06.663
<v 3>Okay.</v>

828
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.950
<v 1>What'd you put them on and oyster change their name.
The fucking Wister.</v>

829
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.890
Willdabeast I dunno.
Former vegetarian and Auntie weight lifter.

830
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.560
A dear Billy bison thighs.

831
00:50:18.561 --> 00:50:22.280
Heard you talking about lifting weights with Kenny Aronoff can I just read that

832
00:50:22.281 --> 00:50:25.520
sentence again?
Heard you talking about lifting weights with Kenny Aronoff.

833
00:50:25.521 --> 00:50:29.180
How fucking awesome was on the podcast.
I can't believe I got to meet that guy.

834
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.780
Really glad you understand the benefits.

835
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.260
I was a vegetarian who only did cardio for five and a half years.

836
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:39.080
I recently started eating animal fat again and I feel a lot better.

837
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:42.500
I'm not going to preach against Fredric [inaudible] vegetarianism,

838
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:46.700
but the mental benefits of those types of cholesterol is complete,

839
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:50.360
improved my hormone energy and cognitive levels.

840
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.740
I only eat grass fed meat and try to eat in the morning to improve brain

841
00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:58.550
function.
Also,
since I started lifting weights once or twice a week,

842
00:50:58.551 --> 00:51:03.200
my upper body feels better than when doing when doing basic tasks around the

843
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:06.530
house and yard.
Uh,
what's your take on red meat?

844
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.260
Are you picky where it comes from?
Nah,
dude.
I've literally,

845
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:12.140
I'll lead a fucking cow.
They need another cow.
I don't have,

846
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.360
I don't have the patients.
The,
there's a butcher,
you know,
a couple of towns over,

847
00:51:17.361 --> 00:51:19.370
I guess I could go to sometimes I go there,

848
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:23.540
but generally speaking I don't know what I'm eating.
Um,

849
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:28.010
but I try to eat as well as I can.
Uh,
what's my take on red meat?

850
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:31.680
It's fucking delicious.
Um,

851
00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.980
you know,
I start to read up on all of that shit.

852
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:40.390
It just gets so fucking depressing.
So I try me and then he goes to that,

853
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.210
they just say it's grass fed.
Okay.
So it's grass fed.
Everything sends.

854
00:51:44.211 --> 00:51:47.720
It's fucking organic.
It isn't organic.

855
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:50.300
It's got a bunch of crap put in there like

856
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.100
the system to monitor what's in your food.

857
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:58.490
Like most systems at this point is so fucking corrupt.

858
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:04.880
Um,
I don't,
I don't know how to,
I don't know what to do,
but uh,
yeah,
I'm actually,

859
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:06.320
I will go back to lifting weights.

860
00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:08.180
I don't think I'm going to do like bench pressing.

861
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.240
I'll do it with dumbbells for some reason with dumbbells.

862
00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:14.900
I can control the angle independently on both shoulders and I don't have a

863
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:15.621
fucking problem.

864
00:52:15.621 --> 00:52:20.580
But a bench pressing is for a young people and I am not young.
All right.

865
00:52:20.581 --> 00:52:22.490
For Mont Gun Laws Bill,

866
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:26.620
I'm from New Hampshire and I always found it fascinating how lenient for months

867
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.590
gun laws are.

868
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:33.640
Here's a basic rundown of how Bernie runs things and why he's always careful

869
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:35.630
around the gun law conversation.

870
00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.640
A minimum age to pursue,

871
00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.720
purchase and possess in Vermont,

872
00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:46.721
Vermont allows any person age 16 or older to possess a handgun without the

873
00:52:47.001 --> 00:52:48.740
consent of a parent or Guardian.

874
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:53.240
There is no minimum age to possess a rifle or a shotgun in Vermont.

875
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:58.220
Fremont law allows firearm sales to anyone.
16 years or older.

876
00:52:58.221 --> 00:53:01.940
Thanks.
All right,
well I really don't have a problem with any of that.

877
00:53:01.941 --> 00:53:06.890
I just have a problem with people who are mentally ill getting them.
Uh,

878
00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.940
that's the problem.

879
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:13.100
And nobody on either side seems to know how to stop that from happening.

880
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:19.540
You know the guy's the fucking people who buy guns keep making this is this guy

881
00:53:19.701 --> 00:53:22.460
made this whole video showing how like this,
this rifle,

882
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:26.990
he had had a bullet twice the size of an ar 15 going,

883
00:53:26.991 --> 00:53:28.790
but this is the,
this is the friendly gun.

884
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.370
Nobody's scared of this one and it's got a bolt twice cyber.

885
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.260
So you have to stop that and semi automatic.
You know what this saying?

886
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:36.930
You know what they're saying?

887
00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:41.570
And everybody's just got to fucking just sit there and act like they don't

888
00:53:41.571 --> 00:53:42.710
understand what the f doesn't.

889
00:53:42.711 --> 00:53:47.711
Everybody want this shit to stop somebody for the love of fucking God.

890
00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.380
Just come up,
figure out how to fuck you.

891
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:56.500
You can't be a fucking nutjob and just walk in and get a fucking gun.

892
00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.340
That's the fucking problem.

893
00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:02.600
But people who like to buy guns don't want it to be extra difficult for them to

894
00:54:02.601 --> 00:54:05.030
get the fucking thing because they're not nuts.

895
00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:07.563
<v 0>So,</v>

896
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.660
<v 1>which is crazy to me.
I don't,
you know,</v>

897
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.730
ah Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya,
Ya.
But watching both of those arguments,

898
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:20.410
they're talking about two totally different fucking things.
One size,

899
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.120
just like cage free to have all of the guns.
Stupid.

900
00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:25.680
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

901
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.830
<v 1>Guns are great.
Guns do great things.
Okay?
They,
they do.</v>

902
00:54:28.831 --> 00:54:32.130
You keep defend yourself with a gun and you can provide,

903
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.910
you can hunt with a gun.
Okay?

904
00:54:35.911 --> 00:54:39.150
You can scare somebody off with the fucking gun.
This is great fucking things.

905
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:41.010
And then there's bad things you could do with the gun.

906
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:41.923
<v 0>Okay.</v>

907
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.860
<v 1>Um,
to Helen,
adventure.
Hell of an adventure.
All right,</v>

908
00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:49.350
wife on able to grow the fuck up.
Okay.

909
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:55.470
Hey there.
Billy said old sober ball sack.
Now I'm not sober anymore.

910
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.380
I got a rack,
a bud tall sitting in the fridge.

911
00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.530
I love a Budweiser every once in a while and it can't,

912
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:05.050
it takes me back to when I first got shit faced down.
Faneuil Hall.
Uh,
Ben,

913
00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:08.190
a listener for a few years.
Actually I was drinking Michelob light that night.

914
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:11.700
I'm a particular,
um,

915
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:15.780
I'm particularly a fan of the way you look at sensitive topics like religion.

916
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:20.160
Not everyone is able to question the fact of why all other religions sound
silly,

917
00:55:20.161 --> 00:55:24.390
like our own.
I love that bit on your special.
Well thank you.
You know,

918
00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:27.390
and as much as you loved it,
somebody else thought I was a servant of Satan.

919
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.340
Now for the question,
I'm a guy on my early thirties,

920
00:55:32.341 --> 00:55:33.420
you mean in my early thirties.

921
00:55:33.421 --> 00:55:36.540
Married with a boot with a beautiful two year old daughter.

922
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:40.050
Congrats on yours by the way.
It's a wonderful thing being a father.
Yes it is.

923
00:55:40.051 --> 00:55:44.070
However,
my wife routinely gets nostalgic about her teenage years.

924
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:48.780
She's unable to get a steady job,
keeps changing topics.
It's,
it's school.

925
00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:52.260
So she attends a certain course for a couple of years,

926
00:55:52.261 --> 00:55:56.490
gives up heads onto the next one.
I was hoping becoming a mum would help,

927
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.860
but it looks like it hasn't recently.

928
00:55:58.861 --> 00:56:03.861
She's even been asking how upset would I be if she told me she was cheating?

929
00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:11.660
Oh,
what the fuck it,
that's it.
Uh,

930
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:16.730
she has apparently been watching some fucking show on Netflix where the

931
00:56:16.821 --> 00:56:21.821
protagonist is a check that cheats to feel free and young again.

932
00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.653
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

933
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.020
<v 2>Oh my,
isn't it a fight?
It's just women.
I swear to fucking God.
I swear to God.</v>

934
00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:30.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

935
00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:32.060
<v 2>Do you know if they have,</v>

936
00:56:32.061 --> 00:56:36.170
I put a show on the fucking air where a guy was cheating on his wife to feel

937
00:56:36.171 --> 00:56:37.520
free and young again,

938
00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:42.620
the amount of fucking attacks that that God damn show would get.
You know,

939
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:46.520
this is one thing that I have learned generally when it comes to women.
Okay.

940
00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:50.030
If you fuck up,
it's your fault.
Okay.
It's your fault.

941
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.750
If they fucked up,
it's because it's something you did.

942
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.250
That's kind of how it works.
Um,
I told her,

943
00:56:58.251 --> 00:57:03.140
I think that's bullshit.
I can go out on a guys' night out,
smoke a cigar,

944
00:57:03.141 --> 00:57:05.630
and drink some alcohol and have a fucking great time.

945
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.110
And that's basically more than enough for me.
Unfortunately.

946
00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.910
I have also found out she's been trying to engage in conversation with their

947
00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:18.740
first big crush.
Oh boy.
Dude.
Like,
I,
you know,

948
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.200
you don't have to be a genius to read these tea leaves here,
man.

949
00:57:21.201 --> 00:57:22.550
At least the way you're presenting it.

950
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:23.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

951
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.030
<v 2>So what's your takes on this?
What the fuck do I do with this woman?</v>

952
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:30.060
We're planning on having a second child,
but honestly,

953
00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:31.830
I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

954
00:57:31.831 --> 00:57:36.000
It's fine for me to stay with my daughter and she can fuck off if that's what

955
00:57:36.001 --> 00:57:36.834
she wants.

956
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.100
<v 0>Uh,</v>

957
00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.260
<v 2>I almost think you have to tell her that.
Find out first what's just be like,</v>

958
00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:45.460
what's going on with you.

959
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.170
You're asking me how I would feel if you cheated on me.

960
00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.880
You watching this show with this woman's cheating and you're,

961
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:56.980
you're having conversations with your,
your first big crush.

962
00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:04.480
Okay.
I need to know what's going on.
Are you going through a phase?

963
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.480
Because if this fucking things over,
it's fucking over.

964
00:58:07.481 --> 00:58:08.890
I'm not having another kid with you.

965
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.353
<v 0>MMM.</v>

966
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.970
<v 2>And I wouldn't get upset the way I'm getting upset for you to say it.</v>

967
00:58:16.971 --> 00:58:21.650
I would just put it on line like what's going on with you?
And,

968
00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:24.560
um,
I don't know how much I would trust her.

969
00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:25.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

970
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:29.050
<v 2>Listened to what she has to say.
And before,
uh,</v>

971
00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:31.400
I have another kid with that person,
I would fucking die.

972
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:35.410
I would hire a private investigator to follow around to see if she's not fucking

973
00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:40.380
somebody else.
Uh,
no,
I wouldn't,
but you should.

974
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.273
Uh,
by the way,

975
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.630
you said I'm doing very well professionally and have also some hobbies that keep

976
00:58:45.631 --> 00:58:49.470
me entertained.
Having a daughter certainly takes a toll on a relationship.

977
00:58:49.471 --> 00:58:50.700
I'm guessing she's had,

978
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.060
she has too much free time and maybe consequently feels neglected.

979
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:58.170
We do try to watch a show every now and then and we'd go out as a family

980
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.480
regularly on the weekends.
Sex Life is okay.

981
00:59:00.481 --> 00:59:03.720
Not sure if we can blame this situation on me.
Thanks a lot.

982
00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:05.423
<v 0>MMM.</v>

983
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:09.260
<v 2>Well,
God,
no,
she's gonna.</v>

984
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.793
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

985
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.330
<v 2>I mean,
what man does it feel fucking neglected to when they have a kid?
I mean,</v>

986
00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:18.550
your sex life does suffer,

987
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:23.440
<v 1>you know,
so that you then go out and,
you know,</v>

988
00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.700
do something to feel free and wanted.

989
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:29.803
<v 0>MMM.</v>

990
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.970
<v 1>Yeah.
You need to sit down and talk to her.
Uh,
find out what the fuck is going on.</v>

991
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:39.530
And I would just tell her what you're doing and the way you make me feel right

992
00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:42.620
now is not even remotely fair and it's not something I would do to you.

993
00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:50.320
So what the fuck?
Uh,
just clean that up.
Say it in a nice way.

994
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:52.853
<v 0>Uh,</v>

995
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:55.760
<v 1>man,
it's fucking annoying.</v>

996
00:59:55.761 --> 00:59:59.450
Does a show out there where a woman flux around to feel free and young again?

997
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.560
Um,
listen,
here's the thing.
All right.

998
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:08.590
It's not that I even fucking mind that show because I believe that there are

999
01:00:08.591 --> 01:00:09.251
people out there,

1000
01:00:09.251 --> 01:00:13.210
like there's people out there that they're just not designed to be married.

1001
01:00:13.211 --> 01:00:16.360
There's people out there that can actually do that and it doesn't mean shit to

1002
01:00:16.361 --> 01:00:20.020
him.
Both men and women and they can just fucking walk back in.

1003
01:00:20.021 --> 01:00:21.040
It doesn't mean shit to him.

1004
01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:25.210
The problem is the person they're with it means something too.
So,
um,

1005
01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:28.690
I'm pretty fucking open minded,
but uh,

1006
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.830
I've just annoyed that if,
if you made a,
you know,
did they,

1007
01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:36.130
I guess it was Californication like that.
I have no idea.

1008
01:00:36.131 --> 01:00:38.290
I never watched that show.
I couldn't get into that show.

1009
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.980
I didn't get what this guy's problem was.
Ah,
man.
You know,

1010
01:00:41.981 --> 01:00:44.260
these fucking young chicks just want to keep banging me.

1011
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.780
I'm supposed to feel bad for this guy.
Um,
anyways,

1012
01:00:49.781 --> 01:00:52.480
friend's wife is attracted to me.
Jesus

1013
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:58.570
dear billiard,
the cube bald,
the cue balls.

1014
01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:02.470
I like to appreciate the podcasts and everything you do and thank you for taking

1015
01:01:02.471 --> 01:01:05.860
the time to read this email.
No problem.
Thank you for the funny nickname.

1016
01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:09.970
I like it.
Uh,
I'm in a tricky situation here.
There are four people involved.

1017
01:01:09.971 --> 01:01:14.440
My Buddy of 12 years.
Oh man,
his wife of two years.
Dude,

1018
01:01:14.441 --> 01:01:15.280
where's your loyalty?

1019
01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:20.050
My girlfriend of six months and myself,

1020
01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.810
we're all in our mid to late twenties.

1021
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.100
<v 0>Oh boy.
Um,</v>

1022
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.970
<v 1>is recently come to light that the wife is interested in me.
Oh Geez.</v>

1023
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.680
You just skipped over a lot of fucking details.
How did that come about?

1024
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.480
She sent you a Valentine.
Oh,

1025
01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:44.500
you guys having inappropriate conversation that led to that end.
He was,

1026
01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:48.520
I met her about three years ago.
Why she and my buddy were still just dating.

1027
01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:51.970
She was my type and I was drawn to her immediately.

1028
01:01:51.971 --> 01:01:54.730
She is at least a nine for my tastes,

1029
01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.270
but I just put her in the unattainable compartment in my brain.

1030
01:01:58.271 --> 01:01:59.530
Since she wasn't available,

1031
01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:02.890
I did not give her any additional thought beyond being cordial.

1032
01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:07.690
I didn't really care to get to know her and I didn't think about what it would

1033
01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:11.980
be like to date her though she had been single.
I would have gone after it.

1034
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:14.950
All right,
so so far,
according to you,
you've been a good guy.

1035
01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.230
Fast forward to the recent past.

1036
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:22.040
My Buddy's wife and I got to know each other on a bit more of a personal level.

1037
01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:23.840
On my birthday a few months ago,

1038
01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.550
my girlfriend was there too and it seemed like my bud's wife took an interest in

1039
01:02:28.551 --> 01:02:31.430
getting to know my girlfriend as well.
Since then,

1040
01:02:31.431 --> 01:02:36.110
the four of us have hung out a few times and the wife has gotten to know me a

1041
01:02:36.111 --> 01:02:36.944
lot better.

1042
01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:37.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1043
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.990
<v 1>I've also been hitting the gym,</v>

1044
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.820
which has gotten the attention of my buddy's wife.
Ah,

1045
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:46.390
Jesus Christ.

1046
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:47.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1047
01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:50.760
<v 1>All right.
They'd been married two years,
your 20s in your late twenties.</v>

1048
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.530
So she's looking to pull the ripcord.

1049
01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:54.670
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1050
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:58.780
<v 1>MMM.
Where the fuck was I?</v>

1051
01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:06.170
Yeah.
Okay.
So one weekend a group of people including myself and my buddy's wife.

1052
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:07.200
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1053
01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:11.580
<v 1>Go to a club.
My girlfriend was invited but decided to go to sleep instead.</v>

1054
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:16.940
Obviously alcohol was flowing and there isn't much room on a dance for I'll

1055
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:20.340
spare you the details.
Do what do you mean?
Spare me the details?

1056
01:03:20.341 --> 01:03:24.030
It was just getting good.
Fuck what the fuck.

1057
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:26.340
This is like a a Cinemax movie.

1058
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:30.570
I'll spare you the details and suffice to say that I learned that night that she

1059
01:03:30.571 --> 01:03:31.404
was into me.

1060
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:32.873
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1061
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:37.470
<v 1>Uh,
when,
what she was doing the running man on your Dick.
I don't know what.
Okay.</v>

1062
01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.590
I was pretty overwhelmed and thrilled because I thought she was a bit out of my

1063
01:03:41.591 --> 01:03:43.750
league and I'm also,

1064
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:46.930
I'm also am not the happiest in my relationship.

1065
01:03:46.931 --> 01:03:49.600
What makes it harder for me to sort out my feelings on the matter.

1066
01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.110
This girl likes cells in the areas that my girlfriend doesn't am.

1067
01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:58.000
I certainly am very attracted to her and enjoy this type of attention.

1068
01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:01.810
I didn't know if she was unhappy in a relationship of what I've tried to see

1069
01:04:01.811 --> 01:04:04.930
what this girl wants or if there's a problem with their marriage,

1070
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:08.080
but she has had a lot of dodgy answers,

1071
01:04:08.081 --> 01:04:11.890
like I wasn't looking for anything or this isn't supposed to go anywhere,

1072
01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.410
or I'm perfectly happy in my relationship,
et cetera.

1073
01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:18.520
She also has a hard time committing to any boundaries of fuck this chick.

1074
01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:22.330
Fuck this chick.
Or maybe she just got drunk and said something stupid.

1075
01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:23.643
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1076
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.110
<v 1>It all sounds like bullshit to me.</v>

1077
01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:29.160
I think she is lacking affection from my buddy and she's bored and Horny.

1078
01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:32.610
She also sounds like she just doesn't want to admit that there's a problem.

1079
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:36.030
She's trying to have the security of a marriage and the thrill of a new romance.

1080
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:38.880
We haven't kissed or anything yet big word yet,

1081
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.660
but I feel like we've already desecrated both of our relationships.

1082
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.880
I also feel like any increased fun,

1083
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:48.390
talk about it and the tension will eventually reach the inevitable breaking

1084
01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:50.760
point.
Yeah.
You gotta stay away from her.
What should I do?

1085
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.190
My girlfriend will lose her shit.
If she hears about this.

1086
01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:56.970
My buddy will be really unhappy.
I think you flipped those.

1087
01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.270
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1088
01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:02.110
<v 1>I think you girlfriend be unhappy.
Your Bro,
your buddy.
We'll re lose his shit.</v>

1089
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.413
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1090
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:04.640
<v 1>Um,
anyways,</v>

1091
01:05:04.641 --> 01:05:08.750
and I already feel like I couldn't trust this girl if we did get together.

1092
01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:13.050
However,
I don't really care.
I just loved the hookup with her.
I can,

1093
01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:15.920
while it's honest,
I could tell this girl has something wacky going on,

1094
01:05:15.921 --> 01:05:18.100
but I don't have the strength to reject her advances.

1095
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.680
<v 2>What should I do?
Thank you so much and go fuck yourself.</v>

1096
01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:25.681
I stopped going out to the club with them or fucking rub one out before you go

1097
01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:30.640
out or don't drink when you go out there.
Yeah,
that's going to blow up.

1098
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.640
That is going to fucking blow up

1099
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.440
and your face.
Um,

1100
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.750
but who's kidding who,
man,
that type of shit happens all the fucking time.

1101
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:45.910
All the fucking time.

1102
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:51.990
Married women will come up to another guy and say that they're attracted to

1103
01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:52.451
them.

1104
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:56.080
I mean there's all this shit out there now about guy's behavior and that type of

1105
01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:58.750
shit.
Um,
you know,

1106
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:04.030
women do it all the fucking time and they say they're better at it.

1107
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.090
I don't think they necessarily are.
I think what the thing is,

1108
01:06:07.091 --> 01:06:09.880
is that just women are into vengeance.

1109
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.530
So you know,

1110
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:19.690
you know,
if,
if he gets like something like that going and if the end,

1111
01:06:19.691 --> 01:06:22.270
if they don't get a fucking check for $1 million in a house,

1112
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.340
they're going to try to do something to blow up your life.

1113
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:28.930
That's what they do guys.
We walk away.
Fuck you.
Booch and we just,

1114
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:31.750
we've generally speaking,
we just,
we walk away.
They,
they don't,

1115
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.980
they burned down your fucking life.
Um,
so,
uh,

1116
01:06:35.981 --> 01:06:37.960
dude dairy,
first of all,

1117
01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:42.961
break up with the fucking check you're with now and go find somebody else to

1118
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:44.740
fuck around with.
All right?

1119
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.610
You don't need to be fucking around with your buddies,
unhappy wife.

1120
01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.260
Um,
cause you're never going to be able to trust her.
All right.

1121
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.110
Do you just not,

1122
01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.040
and then you're going to lose your friendship at 12 years with this other guy.

1123
01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.590
All right?
This is basically,
um,

1124
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.800
like your Dixon Congress right now.
Like filibustering,
you know

1125
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.250
your deck has the floor right now.
That's what the problem is.

1126
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.090
If you just sit down,
okay.

1127
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.160
And you listed all the pros and cons of doing this.
If you are aware,

1128
01:07:24.161 --> 01:07:28.360
I was at right now sitting there,
the answer is easy.

1129
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:33.160
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
But when your rented and your deck is there,

1130
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:37.390
all fucking logic goes out the fucking window.
So,
um,

1131
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.260
you know,
uh,
I dunno,
I just,

1132
01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.490
you know,
I,
I would just fucking,

1133
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:52.460
she said there's nothing else to it.

1134
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:55.790
I would leave it at that and if she brings it up again,
I would just say,
look,

1135
01:07:55.791 --> 01:07:58.190
you said there was nothing to it.
Okay.

1136
01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:04.010
So I don't want to hear any more of that kind of talk.
I already did it.

1137
01:08:04.011 --> 01:08:06.330
You can't hang out with her anymore.
You can't,

1138
01:08:06.331 --> 01:08:10.080
you cannot fucking hang out with her unless that dude is there.

1139
01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:13.750
And if this guy is really a fucking friend,
by the way,
wait a minute.

1140
01:08:13.751 --> 01:08:16.580
If this guy is really your friend,
you know,

1141
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.040
you wouldn't be thinking about doing that.
And B.

1142
01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:25.523
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1143
01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.470
<v 2>Oh Man,
I don't know if you tell him.
I don't know if he should tell.</v>

1144
01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:32.250
I wouldn't tell him it's a fucking mess.
You know a woman would.
Women would,

1145
01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:34.230
<v 3>okay.</v>

1146
01:08:34.230 --> 01:08:37.460
<v 2>Women would initiate the conversation and then turn around and fucking tee,</v>

1147
01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.320
you know?
Yeah.
Don't tell him.
Don't tell them.

1148
01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.650
That's a stupid fucking idea cause she,
she'll flip the fucking story,

1149
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:47.560
start crying,
he'll feel bad and he's going to choose her over you.
Dude,

1150
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:48.420
you got a situation.

1151
01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.630
There's just so many fucking ways that this can go and none of it's good unless

1152
01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:53.730
you just walk away,
walk away,
go back to the wrong.

1153
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.160
Go back to the wrong fucking sad moment in fucking when you're playing cards,

1154
01:08:59.161 --> 01:09:00.990
we just kind of admit,
you're not going to win tonight.

1155
01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:04.650
Just fucking cash out and go back to the fucking room.
That's what you should do.

1156
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.760
A jerk off tours.
As much as you fucking want to get it out of your system.

1157
01:09:08.761 --> 01:09:12.240
Go find somebody else that you like that makes you not to think about your

1158
01:09:12.241 --> 01:09:15.570
buddy's wife.
How about that?
There?
There we go.
Um,

1159
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:20.460
but I'm sure she just wants to feel free.
All right.

1160
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:23.370
I know I was a little bit of an asshole,
but what are you gonna do?
All right.

1161
01:09:23.371 --> 01:09:26.040
That's the podcast.
Um,
once again,
thank you very much.

1162
01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:31.041
It came out in Vancouver and I'm going to be in Ontario coming up this weekend

1163
01:09:32.431 --> 01:09:35.370
on the 17th.
Wherever the fuck I'm going to be.
I came up against when Al,

1164
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:39.660
I think it's up on my website.
Bill Bill bird.com.
That's the podcast.

1165
01:09:39.661 --> 01:09:42.600
Go fuck yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
