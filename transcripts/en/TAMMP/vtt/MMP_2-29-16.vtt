00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.920
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.280
Monday,
February 29th,

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.390
2016 happy late.

4
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.293
<v 2>Yay.</v>

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.740
<v 1>Oh happy leap year and happy birthday to the poor said clients who only have a</v>

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.460
birthday once every four years,
you know.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.391
Good Lord.

8
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.150
Can you imagine going on that first day with that broad pitch in about that?

9
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:28.560
And I always feel love tone.

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.940
It was like everybody yells at a birthday every single year.

11
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.600
It was like,
oh zero.
Then I was four then it was a,

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.160
you know,
she'd be in good shape.
Dog

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.200
Eating fucking 75% less birth gate.
Birthday cake every year.

14
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:50.080
Right now I'll wait.
And how does that math work out?

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.190
If in four years you had four slices of cake,
all right,

16
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.420
but you appointed a leap year,
you only had one.
Yeah,

17
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.800
that percentage doesn't work cause you know you have one.
Somebody else says too,

18
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:04.840
they got 100% more than you got,
right?

19
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.710
They provided their equals slices.
Now Jason's pill,

20
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.150
you're gonna if you're gonna break out fractions,

21
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:13.660
I think of Gunnar still a little birthday cake.
Fractions.
All right,

22
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:16.780
so then they're getting fucking 300% more cake than you are,

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.140
man.
I Bay,
you know something.
I've been,

24
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:25.030
anybody's born on February 29th is either a miserable con or just one of the

25
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.530
coolest laid back people like,
you know,
oh my God,
another birthday.

26
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:34.000
I think years flying by now.
Now they're not actually,
to be honest with you,

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.900
that's kind of weird.
So like when the fuck are you actually like,

28
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.580
<v 0>okay,</v>

29
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.990
<v 1>like say when you're 29 you know that doesn't work.</v>

30
00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:46.900
Do your 28 it's gotta be forced,
right?
Wait,

31
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:51.080
your zero Jesus Christ is,

32
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.180
it'd be fucking annoying.

33
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.660
Zero if you had a baby born on the 29th grade year is zero the first year.

34
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.480
<v 0>All right.</v>

35
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.900
<v 1>One,
two,
three now four be back again to four right?
I don't fucking know.</v>

36
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.560
All I know is it somebody's birthday today and it hasn't been their birthday

37
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.830
since 2012 so happy fucking birthday.
What does that work out?

38
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.190
16 1514 1312 would be five years.

39
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.000
I can't fucking do it.
I don't know when it was once every three years,

40
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.960
cheeses,

41
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.710
anything that happens every four years usually sucks people's birthdays on leap

42
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.770
year,
World Cup soccer,
the Olympics,
you know,

43
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.870
actually like Olympic hockey,

44
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:38.510
but then I hate all this fucking Douche is who never watched hockey.

45
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:42.350
And they'd be like,
see if it was like this,
I would watch it all the time.
What?

46
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:46.260
Only two weeks long with no fighting.
You fucking do shit beat.

47
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.970
Nobody cares whether you watch it and not least.
I know.

48
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.560
At least I don't.
So,
um,
anyways,
I apologize for the,
uh,
you know what?

49
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.080
I don't apologize.
Oh,
I okay.
I will,
I will.

50
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.890
I'll apologize for the being this late.

51
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.850
I was going to do it on Sunday when I was up in Foxwoods.
Joe,

52
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.500
this go to the fucking casino while in the middle of words,
Yo,

53
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.790
um,
I was going to record on Sunday,
but a verse,

54
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.990
he got some tickets to see the Yukon,

55
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.800
a Houston cougars game up,
uh,
you know,

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.790
big fucking program by the way,
man.
How about the fight?
You know,
very quietly.

57
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.430
I probably shouldn't say very quietly.

58
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.240
I just don't pay attention to the sports ladies hopes.
You know,

59
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.030
I knew that fucking,
uh,
Tennessee with pat summit,
right.

60
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.020
Was fucking crushing it.
And I know Yukon was,

61
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.290
I thought they were doing all right,

62
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.420
but I thought it was mainly fucking pat summit.

63
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.870
And then I went to the Goddamn Yukon game.

64
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.890
I got a picture of it here on my phone.
You know,
somebody sent me a picture of a,

65
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.980
of a hairless pit bull that had freckles.

66
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.470
It's the most adorable thing ever seen in your life,

67
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:54.520
but the person said it looked like

68
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.793
<v 3>maybe,</v>

69
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.050
<v 1>ah,
I like a good tweet.
You know,
I don't get,</v>

70
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.670
I don't give a shit if you break my balls,
if it makes me laugh.
All right,

71
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:09.320
so the fucking lady,
the lady huskies.
Well,

72
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:11.420
let's do it in order here.
Let's do the guys first.

73
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.160
Considering they have way less.
You know,

74
00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:16.820
you always want to build towards your closing bit.
All right,
the guys,

75
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.880
the fellows have won four national championships since 1999.

76
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.941
All right.

77
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:27.941
The Yukon men's huskies have one 1999 2004 2011 2014 that's very fucking

78
00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:32.810
respectables.
Anybody want more than that?
I don't know.

79
00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:36.950
I'm not going to look it up.
Kentucky or Duke,
I would guess.
Maybe not Duke.

80
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.740
Right dough.
Dough.
All right.
Um,

81
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.230
but the ladies,
they want it.
95.

82
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.410
<v 4>Okay.</v>

83
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.410
<v 1>They want it in 2000 2002 2003 2004 2009 and then the fucking Goddamn poor</v>

84
00:04:56.581 --> 00:05:00.140
excuse for speakers hanging from that fucking building that they have what it

85
00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:02.820
through the ceilings.
Peeling is in the way.
The next two banners,

86
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.780
they want it 2014 2015 now I got to fucking look it up.

87
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.580
Well,
as far as what I can see here on the phone,
that's one,
two,
three,
four,
five,

88
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:13.720
six,
seven,
eight.

89
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.593
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.210
<v 1>And there's two other banners behind that that's gotta be a championship won.</v>

91
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:20.850
Yeah.
National Champions.
What an asshole.

92
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:22.920
What a fuck did I walk down and take it correctly?

93
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.070
I'll maybe look it up before I did this.

94
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.650
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.090
<v 1>All right.
Hang on a second.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Oh,
Jesus.</v>

96
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.520
Now I'm typing on my phone.
This is going to take for fucking ever,

97
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.780
I looked a lot the most random women's huskies.

98
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.210
Why would I write that?
That's not going to get me there.

99
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.103
<v 4>Okay.</v>

100

Connecticut women's basketball.
I apologize.</v>

110
00:06:11.311 --> 00:06:14.730
I even know if I had an had any fucking decency,
I would edit most of the south,

111
00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:16.380
but I'm not gonna.
All right.

112

National Tournament Championship as Ebidta Conference Championships.

113
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.220
Jesus fucking Christ.
Nobody cares about any of this.

114
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.760
Elite eight final four tournament champions.

115
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.450
95 2000 2002 2003 2004 2009 2010 2013 2014 2015 one,

116
00:06:39.721 --> 00:06:44.340
two,
three,
four,
five.
They wanted five or less.
Six fucking years.

117
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.630
And since the year 2000 number that corner a bit.

118
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.920
They wanted one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,

119
00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:56.580
nine fucking times total domination.

120
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.020
Fuck a dog snoring.
You know my dog's getting fat.

121
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.990
I don't know what's going on with him.
He's changed his food.

122
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:06.960
We started getting her an extra can cause she's always fucking come on over

123
00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:10.280
licking the bowl there.
You know we felt bad for now.
You should see it.

124
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:14.970
She looks like a fucking stake worker,
right?
Tennessee lady.

125
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

126
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.240
<v 1>Falls.
All right,
here we go.
Come on Wikipedia.</v>

127
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:24.280
Where the fuck are you
lady Vol?
What'd,
what'd he say?

128
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.860
W what do you think is we think of as more,
Huh?

129
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.870
I get to go with Connecticut at that point.

130
00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:32.520
I though this might be the most boring podcast ever.
Why?
What do you do?

131
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.780
You get what you pay for.
All right,
fuck it.

132
00:07:36.781 --> 00:07:40.320
I'm not looking it up at a mama eyes.
A,
C and C,
a double here.

133
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.250
I'm very impressed with both of them.
Man.

134
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.950
They're quietly crushed and it's a nice small campus.

135
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.330
They play in this little ass building with,
with Shit Pailin from the ceiling.

136
00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:53.940
The student section was hilarious.
You know when they introduced the other team,

137
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:56.340
they sit there reading the newspaper.
I thought that was funny.

138
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.100
Now I'm sure somebody's gonna say,
well al Qaeda oil,

139
00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:02.200
corn fucking university used to do that.
I don't give a shit.

140
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.320
It's the first time I saw it.
It was fighting and me,
um,
do,

141
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.250
there was a guy sitting behind is like classic New England Sports Fan.

142
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.120
I never heard a guy like eat anytime the ball didn't go in for the huskies.

143
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.960
He fought,
he had a reason every fucking time down the court.

144
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.900
And this is what killed me.
So I'm like,
all right,
this guy's a total who pad.

145
00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:22.440
Right?

146
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.930
And I turned around and he has on a red sox hat and tee shirt until he's

147
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.430
basically a sports maniac.
Right?
The guy missed his shot.
He'd be like,
Eh,

148
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.550
I didn't follow through.
Next time they come down the court and the big guy,

149
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:37.510
the guy,
you should have been rotating around these.

150
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.740
The second day I had to double.
Kb should been rotating around.

151
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.130
Next time down the court,
somebody slips.
It was it,

152
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:47.790
what does it something wrong with the floor.
And I just kept nudging Farsi.

153
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.710
He would,
he would go on like,
like,
like the fucking lady huskies here.

154
00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:55.800
He would go on like four,
five,
four or five runs there,

155
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.290
except instead of winning championships,
he'd be like,

156
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:01.350
bitch moaning and complaining.
And at one point he made a point,
you know,

157
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.680
they threw it to their big goof there and the guy fucking missed the ball.
And,

158
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:06.990
uh,
the guy goes,
you know,
if he had a pair of hands,

159
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.390
he would've had to there in verse.
He turned around and goes,
you know what,

160
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.750
you're right.
And the guy just looked at him with like an angry look like he was,

161
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.160
he was so pissed that Yukon was losing.
And we actually,
uh,

162
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.190
you know,
I know they're only having a mediocre year this year.
I mean,

163
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:22.540
he can't fucking win it every year.
But,
um,

164
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.850
you could sense when you were in there the level,

165
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.590
how seriously everybody was taking it.
Because first he kept saying like,
wow,

166
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:30.360
these people take this shit really seriously here.

167
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.610
And I just kept pointing up to all the banners.
I'm like,
uh,

168
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.040
I would say at this point that kind of used to winning.

169
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.320
So I guess they are having a disappointing year,
I guess.

170
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:42.930
I have no idea.
I didn't look it up.
I just started talking about it.

171
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:47.760
It's what I did.
But that's why the podcast,
um,
was not ready.
Um,

172
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.870
I had a great time up at Foxwoods resort casino is,

173
00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:55.800
by the way,
I want to thank them for having me.
It was their 24th anniversary.

174
00:09:55.801 --> 00:10:00.690
Right.
So they say to me,
um,
before I get there,

175
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:05.560
they said,
is there any way before your first show if you could come down,
um,

176
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.020
there's a big dinner or something we'd love if you could meet the,
uh,

177
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:13.800
the tribal council and just stop by and say,
hello.
Right.

178
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.590
These are my employers for the weekend.
What am I going to say?
No.
So I'm like,

179
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:17.424
absolutely.

180
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.320
I want to meet these native Americans that fucking beat the white man,
you know,

181
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.760
and got their own fucking casino,
right.

182
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:30.630
So I go down there and I just thought it was going to swing by a table and say

183
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:33.120
hello to somebody,
thank them for the Gig.

184
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:34.380
And next thing you know they got this whole,

185
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:37.920
this is like fucking eyes wide shut fucking dinner going on,

186
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:41.310
you know the shining kind of shit in the bowels of the casino.

187
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.210
There's some band and there's a stage and is like this Guy Smiley looking

188
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:48.990
fucking political guy on stage and next thing you know he's,

189
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:53.160
he's given me an intro.
I had no fucking idea I was going on.

190
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:55.500
I have no idea what these people are.
And furthermore,

191
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.290
these people had no idea who I was and I just walk on and they go play up.

192
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.530
We've got a local funny man he had this weekend.

193
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.830
Please welcome comedian bill burn.
I was standing there go,
is he bringing me up?

194
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.790
See,
forgive me up and I just fucking walk on stage.

195
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:07.980
I take the mic and I was like,

196
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.220
I'm looking out at all these old people and shit and it just staring at me.

197
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:15.060
I was like,
ah,
the Cardia I had no idea.
I was uh,

198
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.440
I was going to be brought up here,
but um,
you know,

199
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:21.810
congratulations on 24 years.

200
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.340
I'm sure most of you people here know who the next four presidents are going to

201
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:28.830
be on behalf of regular people.

202
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:31.260
If you could do something about the population problem.

203
00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:35.700
I really appreciate it and all of this shit is getting nothing.
Right.

204
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:38.610
I just started talking to them like they were running the world and to just

205
00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:43.200
looking at me like I got fucking 10 heads and I just said,

206
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:47.340
I just sort of petered out and I went in and uh,
onward and upward.

207
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.010
I just handed it back,

208
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.670
the Guy Smiley and there was just like a little of applause and I just walked

209
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:58.810
back into the hall with the promoters will walk away.
I was like,
what the,

210
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.410
what the fuck was that?
And he's like,
oh,
I don't know.
That's how he talks.

211
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.850
[inaudible] I didn't know what to watch over our doctorate.
Your Orca.

212
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.291
I weren't talking to Dan.

213
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:10.520
A pressure natural guardians showing how long hours are terrible,
you know,

214
00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:15.220
nobody knows anything.
Right.
And they just fucking wheel year round.
Um,
yeah.

215
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:18.740
And then we just fucking,
I think we got on a golf cart at that point.
We,
no,
no.

216
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.840
When we walked through the halls and then they walk me by the crowd that was

217
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:26.890
going into my show.
So I looked like a complete jerk off I fucking,

218
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:28.570
I love seeing people after the show.

219
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:32.200
I fucking hate seeing people before the show.
I don't know why.

220
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.050
I don't know if it's a superstition.
It's just weird to me to be,

221
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.320
for me to just be walking by like the first time you see me,

222
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.190
I'm just walking down the fucking hall.
Oh,
there's that jerk off.

223
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:44.710
And then you just start looking at why did I pay to see that look at them.

224
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.790
But anyways,
we had a,
um,

225
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.270
we had a great fucking time and a bunch of family and friends coming out,

226
00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:58.990
people I hadn't seen in years.
Do you don't mind.
My first best friend

227
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.150
and then I ever had in life actually came up to the Gig and um,

228
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:09.070
I hadn't seen him in 36 years.
And,
um,

229
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.120
I was actually thinking the last time I saw him,
you know,

230
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.470
the reason why my family,
we moved away from the town that we had lived in.

231
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.720
And um,
I just remember we were both,
how fucking old was I?

232
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.800
I think we were like seven or eight and you don't know how to say goodbye.

233
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.490
You know,
I probably had been friends with the kids since I was like four.

234
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:33.340
So basically half my life I was friends with this kid,

235
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.390
so we had loaded up the moving van the last time like we would do in the u haul

236
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:39.640
thing,
you know,
we'll do it ourselves.

237
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.410
And we just made like 900 fucking trips in this thing.
And um,

238
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.470
we were loading it up for the last time.
And uh,

239
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.970
he lived across the street from me.

240
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:52.990
So I walked down my driveway and he was out there and he knew this.

241
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.160
He knew it was in,
I knew it was it.
And we were just too young.
Didn't know.
Yes.

242
00:13:57.161 --> 00:13:58.240
You know what to say.
It's seven.

243
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:02.770
So some kid rode by and I had just written by an a bike and I remember he just

244
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:04.060
said something to me like,
Oh yeah,

245
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:06.700
that kid was trying to say that blah blah blah blah.

246
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.570
I couldn't remember anything.
I was like,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
okay.
I was like,
oh all.

247
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.780
And he just started to walk away and I walked away in the other direction and

248
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:19.780
then we both looked over our shoulder at the same time and then that was it.

249
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.220
I got in the fucking u haul
and that was it.

250
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.160
I think I came back to the neighborhood like four years later.

251
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:29.380
I saw him one other time.
So yeah,
1980.
Yes.

252
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:32.530
Cause I left in [inaudible] 76 some and 80 and then I hadn't seen him since
then.

253
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:36.790
So,
uh,
we got caught up talking about the old fucking times.
Man.

254
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:38.680
We didn't even get into it either.
Man.
Jesus Christ,

255
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:41.890
some of the shit we used to do,
you know,
we used to play with fucking matches.

256
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.080
That's what she used to do back then when there was like,

257
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:46.980
like playing with matches was like,
I dunno,

258
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.320
like having a game boy or whatever these fucking kids do nowadays.

259
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.740
And His dad had these things for,

260
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.480
they will called a monkey matches.

261
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.140
There was just a book of matches and for some reason that they,

262
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.600
it just had a picture of a monkey like wearing like a hat.
Like,

263
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.030
like that was like high brow humor back then,

264
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:08.120
like dress and monkeys up like human beings,
you know.

265
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.240
And also having pictures of dogs playing poker and Shit,

266
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.530
passing cards underneath the table with their paws and shit,
you know.

267
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.840
So his dad,
for whatever reason,

268
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:20.840
I always had these match books that had pictures of monkeys that were like,

269
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.870
you know,
dress like dentists,
you know,

270
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.730
like lab coats on and shit or just some stupid fucking hat,
you know.

271
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.730
And uh,
so we would,
this is what we would do.

272
00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:36.731
We would go over and we would like basically underneath the tree we would bunch

273
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:41.771
up a bunch of pine needles and you would just light it on fire and just look at

274
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.940
the fire and then try and put it out.
And um,
you know,

275
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:49.190
sometimes you put it out,
sometimes you didn't.

276
00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:51.310
Sometimes a neighbor would come running over Christ.

277
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:56.060
What the fuck are you kids though?
Yo Dahlia.
And um,
I did that one time.

278
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.180
I lit it and all of a sudden it just got completely out of control.

279
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.410
And this guy came running over the giant trashcan.
They had filled up with water,

280
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:06.740
thank fucking Christ and um,

281
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.790
and then somebody else in the neighborhood,
I remember fucking lit it on fire,

282
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:15.770
lit the whole fucking woods on fire.
And uh,
I know,

283
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.870
I know it was two because he wrote down to the fire station and,

284
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.570
and said that he didn't do it,

285
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:24.110
but he knows that he knew that my friend did it and he fucking rat it out.

286
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:27.050
My friend and I'm sure the fire department was looking at the kid looking at him

287
00:16:27.051 --> 00:16:31.610
like,
listen,
you little rat,
we know you fucking did it.
Right.
Um,

288
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.000
so what,
I was cool to see him and um,

289
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.870
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about it.
I,

290
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:41.960
I hate doing this thing after I've been on a fucking plane,
you know.
Oh,
you know,

291
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.740
I watched on the plane for the second time,
I saw the movie a black mask,

292
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.880
you know,
I know that that kind of got mixed reviews.
That's one of those movies.

293
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:51.200
You got to see it more than once.

294
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:55.280
See it the second time to Johnny Depp is fucking unbelievable in that movie.

295
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.380
He's unfucking believable.
And um,
there's a couple of other actors here.

296
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:02.870
I've got to get their fucking names.
They were absolutely amazing,
but,
uh,

297
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.940
I liked it the first time.
I loved it the second time I saw it.
So,
um,

298
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.110
you know,
I know,
but most people I heard from a,
from Massachusetts to like,
dude,

299
00:17:12.111 --> 00:17:16.850
the fucking ax as you just shut the fuck up.
You know,
when I went to Fargo,

300
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:19.220
they were bitching about the fucking accents and Fargo,

301
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:24.050
does that mean Fargo's a bad movie?
Well,
why don't,
why don't we hire you,

302
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.440
who's not an actor,
will have you fucking do it and we'll see how that works out.

303
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:31.940
But,
um,
I just felt,
you know,
the second time when I saw it,

304
00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:34.510
like the pacing of it,
I felt like it,

305
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.380
they tied it in to like the absolute sociopath main character that they would

306
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:41.840
try.
You are so fucked up as I'm nervous about talking about it.

307
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:44.930
That's the level of power that those fucking guys had.
Um,

308
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.990
it reminded me of the Shawshank redemption where a lot of people,

309
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:51.530
I know the first time they saw they didn't like that movie because they felt it

310
00:17:51.531 --> 00:17:55.100
was so long.
It was dragging on and on and on and on.
But um,

311
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:56.250
<v 3>okay.</v>

312
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:56.600
<v 1>My,</v>

313
00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.520
my theory on that movie was they were giving you the sense of what it was like

314
00:18:00.521 --> 00:18:04.960
to do time where it becomes like this open ended thing.

315
00:18:04.961 --> 00:18:08.080
No beginning,
no middle,
no end.
It's actually,

316
00:18:08.081 --> 00:18:09.340
sounds like I'm shitting on the movie,

317
00:18:09.341 --> 00:18:13.600
but it's just the way it would fade down and then just fade up and every time in

318
00:18:13.601 --> 00:18:17.950
the crowd you'd like to be anticipating that there'd be this major turn and it

319
00:18:17.951 --> 00:18:22.570
was just another day in prison.
A few years later.
Um,

320
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.250
I kind of felt like they were trying to do that with the Whitey Bulger character

321
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.840
where,
um,
you know,
they was saying like he was a sociopath,
like they,

322
00:18:31.841 --> 00:18:36.841
and how he slowly drew in the FBI guys to the point that they were entangled in

323
00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:40.960
his bullshit.
Um,
any insulated himself that way.

324
00:18:40.961 --> 00:18:45.100
I really,
I dunno.
Maybe I was too dumb to get all of that shit the first time,

325
00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:47.470
but the second time I watched it,
like I said,

326
00:18:47.471 --> 00:18:52.150
I went from liking that movie to fucking loving that movie.
So,
um,
whatever.

327
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.010
Give it a shot if you haven't,

328
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.040
but I'm speaking of which the fucking Os Guinness well,

329
00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:04.700
last night.
Huh?
White guys fucking crushing it.

330
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.060
Ah,
we fucking sweet.
Cleaned up last night.

331
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.390
I'm just fucking with you man.
That was a,
uh,

332
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.580
I only got to see,
I got to see Chris Rock's opening monologue,

333
00:19:21.581 --> 00:19:22.570
which I thought was great.

334
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.780
I thought he handled the whole thing fucking perfectly.

335
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:26.873
<v 3>MMM.</v>

336
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.280
<v 1>And uh,
what else did I see?</v>

337
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.350
I didn't see a lot cause right is it started?
The show was starting.

338
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.570
I think we had a nine o'clock shown.
Started little bit after eight.
But,
um,

339
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.510
I have no idea who won what.

340
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.460
I know the Boston movie about the fucking pedophile priests.
I heard that,

341
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:45.294
that thing one.

342
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.990
<v 3>MMM.</v>

343
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.550
<v 1>That was it.
Nobody fell down.
Nothing else happened,</v>

344
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.250
<v 3>right.
Is that it?</v>

345
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.930
<v 1>Oh,
very quietly.
The first,
uh,
Asian director,</v>

346
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:02.130
I believe ever fucking once something is that what I saw?
I don't know.
This is,

347
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:04.530
you know,
just a reoccurring thing.
I'm not going to look anything up.

348
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:08.480
I'm just going to start talking about it and uh,
you know,
that's going to be it.

349
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

350
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.520
<v 1>You know what I don't understand.</v>

351
00:20:12.521 --> 00:20:15.640
Like I don't understand the weight that people put on the fucking Oscar.

352
00:20:15.641 --> 00:20:18.370
So I really got to tell you that though.
You know what I mean?

353
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:19.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

354
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:24.570
<v 1>I just don't,
I don't fucking get it.
I was joking this weekend,</v>

355
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:27.720
like just sitting there watching a bunch of adults running around wanting to win

356
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:31.020
a trophy.
It's like,
what?
What are you fucking little league

357
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.740
trophy is if a kid's aren't they,

358
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.890
you have ribbons and shit and it makes them feel good and you're taking them out

359
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:41.390
for a fucking snow cone and then that's it.
Yeah,
he put him to bed.

360
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:45.040
You get yourself a whiskey and you sit there and just stare at the wall and

361
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.650
that's basically your life.
I mean,
why would he do old?
Are you,

362
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.560
you need a fucking trophy.
Um,
yeah.
I don't,

363
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:52.390
I don't give a shit about like that type of stuff,

364
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:55.870
but I definitely think that there should be opportunity for everybody.
You know,

365
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.860
I'd like to hear everybody's stories.
So I had no problem with any of that shit.

366
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.640
But I do just think it's funny that people fucking flip out and start crying

367
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:09.430
about winning a goddamn trophy in this trophy means more than that trophy.

368
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.170
This one's more prestigious.
Um,
all right,
let's,

369
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:15.880
I got to do a couple reads here for this week.

370
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.910
What the fuck am I clicking on there?
All right.
Um,
Jesus,

371
00:21:21.911 --> 00:21:25.390
quite trunk club,

you don't.
You can chill out.

373
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.280
You know,
you can sit down on a,

374
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:35.710
on a deck or maybe your neighbor's deck if he's not home,

375
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.020
and just fucking put your feet up and enjoy yourself.

376
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.190
And then what time of year it is,
you got to make every second cap.

377
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.430

I don't know if you guys know this,

454
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:40.130
but I guess they're working on cars that are going to drive themselves in the

455
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:42.980
future.
Um,
I don't know.

456
00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.590
I mean,
how fucking lazy people going to get,
I mean,

457
00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:51.670
it's going to be great for drinking and driving it just be drinking and writing.

458
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.480
You know,
you,
all of a sudden you'll always have that fucking thing,
right?

459
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.370
I don't,
I don't like this man.

460
00:26:57.371 --> 00:27:01.600
I don't like how everything's becoming fucking automated.
You know?

461
00:27:01.601 --> 00:27:05.380
I feel like rich people are gradually phasing us out,

462
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:06.963
you know,

463
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:11.290
cause you know God damn well the only reason why they allow us to exist is

464
00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:14.500
because they need us to farm,
right?

465
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.370
They need us to deliver shit.
They need us to do a bunch of shit.

466
00:27:18.371 --> 00:27:20.410
And I guide could add another example.
I don't know.

467
00:27:20.411 --> 00:27:22.660
Dance around like a monkey at a fucking casino.

468
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.330
Come downstairs and say a couple of words that your little fucking Illuminati

469
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.650
party in the basement.
They need us to do that.

470
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.720
But once everything is automated and it just handles it,
it's fucking self.

471
00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.520
<v 4>Okay.</v>

472
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.040
<v 1>Do you think you could be a part of that group?</v>

473
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:41.500
What if you are part of a group that was just going to slowly fucking just phase

474
00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:46.390
everybody else out,
you know,
in some hours would happen in your lifetime.

475
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.930
All right Mike,

476
00:27:49.931 --> 00:27:53.350
who would you keep these free Hitler s type questions.

477
00:27:53.351 --> 00:27:56.710
But this is the type of fucking madness that I think everybody's capable of.

478
00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.400
You know,
especially,
um,
I don't know if you travel on the road,

479
00:28:00.401 --> 00:28:03.880
some of the dope shit fucking meet out there watching people get stirred up.

480
00:28:03.881 --> 00:28:05.140
You know,
in all honesty,

481
00:28:05.141 --> 00:28:08.320
I can't stand like the choices that we have for president right now,
you know,

482
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.470
is it starts to go towards as a fucking torpedo,
uh,

483
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.360
that fucking Saint Bernard looking guy,
Bernie Sanders,
right?
His jowls,

484
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.850
um,
as a torpedo,
his fucking campaign and all democrats are walking around,

485
00:28:21.851 --> 00:28:24.070
he can't wear it.
He can't win.
I love that.
I love it.
Yeah.

486
00:28:24.071 --> 00:28:27.580
Cause you're too much of a pussy to fucking vote for him.
That's why,
right.

487
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.290
So you're going to vote for this fucking,

488
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:34.060
this clammy fucking crook or this guy who isn't saying anything,
but like,

489
00:28:34.061 --> 00:28:35.140
I really believe that,
you know,

490
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.780
you can talk people into fucking wiping out everybody on the planet.

491
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.990
He's very easily just listening to Donald Trump,

492
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.890
his speeches where he just says absolutely nothing.
You know,

493
00:28:44.891 --> 00:28:47.640
he said today he was talking to college graduates and he's literally going
right,

494
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:52.410
like I'm going to bring jobs back to the United States.
You wait,

495
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:55.230
there's going to be more jobs here by the time I'm done,

496
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:57.780
it's going to make your head spin.
I'm going to have,

497
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.990
I'm going to have apple bring manufacturing jobs back from China to here.

498
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.720
Okay.
And people clapped.

499
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.560
He never has to say how he's going to do all,

500
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.540
I'm going to plug up the hole in the ozone layer.
Water's going to be clear.

501
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.940
I'm going to get rid of all terrorism and that's going to be the first week

502
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.350
I like this guy.
Sky Makes Sense.
He's making it great again.

503
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.630
No.
And then you got to Hillary out.
She just talks to her fucking teeth.

504
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.350
It's like she,
you know,

505
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.870
she looks like she should be doing like a ventriloquist act,

506
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:39.420
but the puppet isn't there.
Um,

507
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.640
fucking,
I dunno.
I have no,

508
00:29:46.641 --> 00:29:48.470
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.
I no idea.

509
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:49.850
And I don't even know who the other guys are.

510
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.640
I just heard a couple of them talking and trying to trash Donald Trump and they

511
00:29:52.641 --> 00:29:56.420
just stay.
Sounded pathetic.
Just not good speakers.
This is just a,

512
00:29:56.421 --> 00:30:00.860
this is a bad one is a bad one.
Yeah.
Like,
I bet people watching,

513
00:30:00.861 --> 00:30:02.050
you know you don't,

514
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.180
if you've got a great college program and a bunch of seniors fucking graduate

515
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.270
graduate and you just,
you know,
he just go through a bad four year period.

516
00:30:08.271 --> 00:30:09.350
I think that's what we're coming through.

517
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.760
We're coming out all right now you know like this one guy who was saying he was

518
00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:17.260
going to get rid of Obamacare if he was elected.
And people like applauding,

519
00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.020
like I,
I just,
I don't fucking get it.
I don't get why I don't even,

520
00:30:21.021 --> 00:30:23.750
I don't have Obamacare.
I guess my tax dollars paid for it,

521
00:30:23.751 --> 00:30:25.340
but I don't have any problems with somebody.

522
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.810
Like I don't want my fellow countrymen walking around with a fucking too thick.

523
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:35.900
You need your spleen removed.
Fuck you figure it out for yourself.

524
00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.480
Why do we help each other out a little more?
You know,

525
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.380
what can we do that and if full act anybody needs this spleen out

526
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:46.120
Donald Trump,
I bet I could run.

527
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.700
I could run for president if that's all you gotta do is just say you're going to

528
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:50.710
do all this awesome shit.
You never fucking do it.

529
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:55.240
And everyone will have healthcare and it will be free.
All right.
Um,

530
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.740
oh,
this weekend,
by the way,
all these self driving cars,

531
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:01.020
let's get back to that fucking thing.

532
00:31:01.021 --> 00:31:03.520
So evidentaly some self driving car hit a bus,

533
00:31:03.521 --> 00:31:08.350
which is fucking tremendous for anybody who loves driving.

534
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.990
That is such a tremendous fucking thing that happened today or yesterday or

535
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:16.960
maybe last year.
All I know is I just found the fucking story.

536
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.440
I'm so fucking site.
It's the self driving car.

537
00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:23.530
Hit the fucking hit the fucking bus.

538
00:31:23.531 --> 00:31:25.870
I mean that even though it was only going like two miles an hour,

539
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.890
it's just so fucking great because it,
it hit a bus.

540
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:35.620
So all you got to say,
it's just,
you know,
just be like,
well what if,

541
00:31:35.621 --> 00:31:37.990
what if there was a bunch of kids on that bus?
Right?

542
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:41.830
And then that'll delay it a good 20 fucking years.
Um,

543
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.620
let me see if I can find this story.

544
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:49.630
Self-Driving Google says it bears some responsibility after self driving car

545
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:53.830
hits bus.
Can you fucking believe that?
What was there?

546
00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.580
Was there a person driving the bus?
I would say that you,
you,

547
00:31:57.581 --> 00:31:59.380
you have all the fucking responsibility.

548
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:03.770
Unless this guy literally drove into the fucking thing.
Elsa,

549
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.730
Ben Incorporate,
incorporate Google set on Monday.

550
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:11.731
It bears some responsibility after one of its self driving cars struck municipal

551
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:15.340
bus in a minor crash earlier this month.

552
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:20.590
The crash may be the first case of one of it's autumn autonomous cars hitting

553
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:23.890
another vehicle and the fault of the self driving car.

554
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:25.480
<v 4>Okay</v>

555
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.160
<v 1>Dude,
this is going to be a shit show.</v>

556
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.440
This is just one and it already hit a fucking bus.

557
00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:37.590
You know what I mean?
That's fucking,
that's lunacy.
It's fucking lunacy,
man.

558
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.540
I will tell you it mean I think it will.
It will.

559
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.460
It will cause people to drink like they've never drank before.
I mean

560
00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.840
hap most nights I don't drink out here because I,
you know,
I drive myself places,

561
00:32:49.841 --> 00:32:54.700
you know,
I don't fucking Uber.
Well that'll put Uber out of business.
Right?

562
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:56.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

563
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.440
<v 1>Well I guess if you don't have a fucking car,
I dunno.</v>

564
00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.450
Don't you guys like driving?
I will.
I'll be have like the option,

565
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.470
my thing is how is the insurance going to work?
Because you know,
God damn well,

566
00:33:08.471 --> 00:33:12.160
there's no way the insurance company is going to take that fucking liability on

567
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.070
it that they're claiming they're going to get rid of.

568
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.780
They'll be no more deaths from car accidents is going to be no more accidents.

569
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.920
It's just going to be,
it's going to be like just accident free.

570
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:25.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

571
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.720
<v 1>This is amazing to me that this,</v>

572
00:33:28.721 --> 00:33:33.400
that it's gotten this fucking far considering,
you know,

573
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.380
that like the amount of times they tried to kill the electric car,
right?

574
00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.570
And you know,
big oil companies,
that type of thing.
I mean,

575
00:33:40.571 --> 00:33:43.720
you're fucking with their,
their blue blood money without having that,

576
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.590
let's go electric cute and elephant to show how fucking dangerous sees cars are.

577
00:33:47.591 --> 00:33:49.120
Right.
So

578
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.830
<v 0>yeah,</v>

579
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.940
<v 1>like
does,
the only thing I can think,
what will these insurance companies,</v>

580
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.970
they're making enough money to go down there and whack somebody at ABC Inc.

581
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.810
Right?
You know,
they fucking do shit like that.

582
00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:04.330
And you go to a diner and all of a sudden you stagger outgoing.

583
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.310
They poisoned me and he'd do a face plant,
then your invention disappears.
Oh,

584
00:34:09.311 --> 00:34:10.900
I'm going down the rabbit hole.

585
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.610
This is why I think they're letting this one go through cause they're eventually

586
00:34:15.611 --> 00:34:17.710
going to get rid of all of us.
And when they do that,

587
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:22.470
they're going to have no more limo drivers.
So they're like,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.

588
00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.030
<v 5>We'll do the future is if we were to Raj somewhere,
I'm it,</v>

589
00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:32.031
I'm not going to drive my car and soil my wealthy hoons Elma.

590
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.900
<v 1>And then somebody is like,
well what if we just had,</v>

591
00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.940
we'll just make the cars drive themselves.

592
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.480
<v 5>Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Kill them all then,
you know,
slinky,</v>

593
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.160
poisoned them.
Remove them from the balloon it.
Okay.

594
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.200
<v 1>Um,
I wonder if they got rid of everybody,
how long it would take for this funk,</v>

595
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.070
you know,
to go back to normal,
you have to take all the nuclear waste bright.

596
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.880
Just send it out,
you know,
out of the fucking space.
Right.

597
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.940
Send it towards Mars.
Just make sure you don't hit the moon

598
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.890
and all you do is just fucking chill out nearly a little house.
I want to,

599
00:35:06.891 --> 00:35:08.790
how long it would take to undo all APP,

600
00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:12.960
but you all this shit that people leave behind,
you know,

601
00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.070
fucking going to do with all of that.
That's all going to go into the soil.

602
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.070
I take a Louie ain't I wouldn't happen in your lifetime.

603
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.240
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

604
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.830
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I am all over the place,
man.
What the fuck am I talking about here?</v>

605
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.010
Murdering people and self driving cars.
You should see this fucking car.

606
00:35:30.011 --> 00:35:33.070
By the way,
this fucking self driving car,

607
00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:36.360
it makes the Volkswagen beetle looked like a Goddamn Lamborghini.
Okay.

608
00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:41.560
People on the Simpsons drive a better looking car then that fucking thing.

609
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.640
<v 4>Okay.</v>

610
00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.090
<v 1>Oh,
you need all that all going to be the exact same fucking one,
right?</v>

611
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:48.560
<v 4>Okay.</v>

612
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.060
<v 1>You'll have your options of like three different colors,
like white,</v>

613
00:35:53.061 --> 00:35:54.800
black or beige.

614
00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:02.060
Oh Man,
this is not uplifting.
I'll tell you what's up.
Lifting March 5th,

615
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:07.410
this weekend,
UFC one 96.
Conor Mcgregor,
um,

616
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.880
UFC one 96.
What are they calling this one?
Did they,

617
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.740
do they stop naming them by the way,

618
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.360
to have they come up with 196 adjectives that,
that,

619
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.570
that describe how fucking tremendous said sports that sport is.

620
00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.210
You know,
you would have seen 12 the redemption,
the red badge or whatever.

621
00:36:26.211 --> 00:36:28.910
They always had like these cool fucking names up to once you get up to like one

622
00:36:28.911 --> 00:36:31.940
96,
they gotta be running out.
Right.

623
00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.510
Let me see what they got here.

624
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.610
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

625
00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:40.950
<v 1>UFC One 96.
Conor McGregor versus some Guy Diaz.</v>

626
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.930
I wish I knew these guys named better.
I'm,
you know,

627
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:48.160
there's only so much shit I can pay attention to.
Um,

628
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.540
these taking on late replacement,
Nate Diaz that Jesus,
what happened?

629
00:36:52.541 --> 00:36:54.010
He was supposed to fight somebody else.

630
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.960
Rafio I'm not going to fucking insulted Latinos by trying to pronounce it,

631
00:36:58.961 --> 00:37:00.580
although I could give you a good laugh here.

632
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:05.820
Rafael dos Anjos Rafael dos Anjos was from his show down against Connor with a

633
00:37:10.781 --> 00:37:13.330
broken foot or get the fuck.

634
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.730
Do you know what I was reading something on Mcgregor today.
Do you know what?

635
00:37:15.731 --> 00:37:18.760
I don't understand.
I don't.
Somebody in the fight game,
please explain this to me.

636
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.300
That guy walks around at one 70 and he's shredded.

637
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.590
And then before his fight for whatever fucking reason,

638
00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.050
he's got to go down to one 45.

639
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.980
Now I can understand if the other guy just walks around at one 45 or maybe one

640
00:37:36.341 --> 00:37:39.220
55 and kind of for whatever reason,

641
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.680
just wants to beat the fuck out of the guy.

642
00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:45.340
So he's willing to starve himself down to one 45 for the love of God.

643
00:37:45.341 --> 00:37:49.720
Can anybody in the fight game that,
that does this,
why can't,

644
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.703
you know

645
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.930
if Carter walks around at one 70 and the other guys walking around at one 65,

646
00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.240
why don't they just fight it like one 60?

647
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.930
Why do they got to bring everybody all the way the fuck down there?
I,
I,

648
00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:05.720
I just don't understand why they got to do that shit.
Um,

649
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:11.440
check out the sports illustrated article on,
uh,
on Conor McGregor.

650
00:38:11.441 --> 00:38:14.620
They got like this whole thing where the only briefly talk about it,

651
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.830
but they're talking about cutting weight.

652
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.010
And it actually sounds in a lot of ways worse than the fight,

653
00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.570
like talking about the pain and the agony of it and it's,
I,
I can't even a,

654
00:38:25.571 --> 00:38:28.600
I'm not going to be able to do it justice because I just read it.

655
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.770
I have a very poor memory and I've never gone through it.
But,
uh,

656
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:37.000
Holly Holmes also fighting against,
we should tape and uh,

657
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.370
I'm taking a night off from stand up and I'm going to fucking hang.

658
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.120
You know what's great,

659
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.270
this is the one sport that I can really watch my wife like,

660
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.420
she likes going to live hoop too,
but she loves the fucking UFC.

661
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:51.070
She gets into it like at a crazy level.
Like that time when he,
that guy kicked,

662
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:55.060
kicked the other dude and he had the compound fracture,
you know,

663
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.570
and his fucking leg bent all the way back.
I was just like,
I walked out,
I'm like,

664
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:02.380
I done done.
I can't watch that.
She,
she was rewinding it,

665
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:07.030
wanting to watch it again and was like,
like literally interested in it.
Um,

666
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.240
which means she either should have been a serial killer or gotten into the

667
00:39:10.241 --> 00:39:13.630
medical field because if you can fucking stomach that,
um,

668
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.640
either way I can,
I'm,
I'm really excited to see this shit this weekend.
I like it.

669
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.950
Even if they're quick fights,
even if it's a bad thing,

670
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.720
does it make you at least want to work out?

671
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.380
You see those guys and fucking women getting in and they're all fucking jacked.

672
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.650
You look at down at yourself,
usually finishing off a pizza and like,

673
00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:33.430
what the fuck am I doing going down to home depot tomorrow I'm getting a sledge

674
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:36.760
hammer and a big fucking tire,
you know,
and you know what?

675
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.560
You'd do it for a couple of days and then you quit.

676
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:40.060
And that's why you're not a champion.

677
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.910
Like what you're going to see on fucking Saturday.
There you go.

678
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:47.710
There's my promo for the UFC.
Um,
all right,

679
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.220
let's,
uh,
let's,
let's read some fucking letters for this week.
Shall We?
Everybody,

680
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.990
chances are the close of Cleo.

681
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.840
You're losing your finger sweetheart.

682
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.930
Glad you didn't walk the red carpet at the,
at the fucking Oscars.

683
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:09.580
They would have been all over you.
All right.
Leaving the country.
If Trump wins,

684
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.650
dear Billy elect,

685
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.940
what's your take on people who say they're going to leave the country if Trump

686
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:17.620
wins?
Uh,

687
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:20.980
besides the potential for lanes to open up on the highway.

688
00:40:20.981 --> 00:40:24.500
I just hope the people that say they're going to leave leave,

689
00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:29.050
so I don't have to point out who's a lying sack of shit.
Um,

690
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.890
there are obviously joking,
no one's going to lead this country,
but,
uh,
it's just,

691
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.490
you know,
he's a very extreme guy.
You know,

692
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.170
I think people said that when Obama,

693
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:42.610
they definitely said it during George Bush with some famous star set and I

694
00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:46.700
remember,
I thought it was like funny.
Then of course Fox News,

695
00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:48.740
it was lunch or league.
Why don't you get the fuck Outta here?

696
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:52.090
You're like fucking lunacy.
Um,

697
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.470
what do I think about people say that?
I think it's kind of Hacky at this point.

698
00:40:56.471 --> 00:40:57.880
I think that's what everybody says.

699
00:40:57.881 --> 00:41:02.860
When there's somebody that's on the fringe on one side or the other,

700
00:41:02.861 --> 00:41:05.560
somebody always ends up going to [inaudible] fucker wins are going to leave.

701
00:41:05.561 --> 00:41:09.550
Where are you going to go?
This is what people forget when you,
uh,

702
00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:11.230
when you leave this country,
you,

703
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:14.890
you immediately become an immigrant who's taking somebody else's job in the

704
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:18.940
country that you're going to and you get treated as such.
You know,

705
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.910
even if you white,
they don't want,

706
00:41:21.911 --> 00:41:25.120
but they don't want Americans moving up to Canada,
fucking with their population,

707
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.280
taking their jobs.
You know,

708
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.880
all of a sudden you're standing this driving a spike into a tree to take out

709
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:34.010
some maple syrup instead of the other guy.
They don't want that.

710
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.560
I don't want that at all.
Um,
all right.

711
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.520
Yeah,
I just think that just the same,
I mean,
it's fucking scary.
I mean,

712
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.830
it's both scary.
I think Hillary's a fucking lying sack of shit.

713
00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:53.470
Totally dishonest.
And I think Donald Trump is a reality show star.
Okay.

714
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:55.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

715
00:41:55.470 --> 00:42:00.420
<v 1>That's the best we can fucking dope.
I just don't fucking get it.</v>

716
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.920
It keeps getting worse.

717
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.260
Jesus fucking,
the last guy,

718
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:13.250
the last guy that I thought was decent was the first George Bush,
you know?

719
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:14.860
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

720
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.830
<v 1>I like Bonnie went into Kuwait and then like,
he keeps it all right.</v>

721
00:42:17.831 --> 00:42:18.910
That's enough.
That's enough.

722
00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:21.460
He didn't go all fucking nuts and we got the fuck out of there,

723
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.900
you know,
and then fucking Clinton came in.

724
00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:30.200
I don't what the fuck that was a big frat party where he's getting his dick

725
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:34.610
shocked.
He's lying about shit.
People got stuff on them mysteriously die.
I mean,

726
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:35.520
it was fucking nuts.

727
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.020
Then he bombed some people to get out of a fucking blow job accusation.

728
00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:43.510
They'll whole fucking thing was,
I don't know.
It's been crazy ever since.
Um,

729
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.680
I don't know shit about politics.
Don't listen to me.
All right.
Boyfriends,

730
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.350
smoking habit.
Hey Mister burr.
Love the podcast and the stand up.

731
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:55.970
Come to Rochester,
New York soon.
Uh,
I would love all,
you know what,
you know,

732
00:42:55.971 --> 00:43:00.500
what is a buffalo date and as Syracuse date in the works.

733
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:05.240
Yes ma'am.
Yes sir.
Whatever.
Wherever this is writing the shit.
Um,

734
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:11.060
uh,
with the f I just scrolled down.
Sorry.
Love the podcasts and the standup.

735
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.230
Come to Rochester,
New York.

736
00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.920
How would appreciate some advice from yourself and the lovely Nia if she's

737
00:43:15.921 --> 00:43:19.040
available.
Uh,
she ain't here today,
man.
All right.

738
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:22.700
I've been with my boyfriend for almost two years and since day one,

739
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.220
I knew of his daily weed smoking habit.

740
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.350
He doesn't let her let it hinder his life.
Still very social,

741
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.850
faithful,
going to,
going to work every day.
Uh,
he scheduled,

742
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:37.940
he eats healthy and he goes to the gym four to five days a week.

743
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.420
I tried getting used to it,
um,

744
00:43:41.421 --> 00:43:45.920
since it's something that he does and it,
and it isn't a problem in his life,

745
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:49.730
but I've never wanted to try drugs or alcohol.

746
00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:53.390
So I don't know what the feeling of being under the influence of something as

747
00:43:53.391 --> 00:43:56.930
like now because not because of that.

748
00:43:56.931 --> 00:44:00.260
My problem is unless I see him during the day,

749
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.800
and even then it'll take a hit.
He's not sober.

750
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.360
Is it wrong of me to be concerned that whenever he sees me,

751
00:44:08.361 --> 00:44:11.180
he's under the influence of something?
Uh,

752
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:13.520
whenever we go to the movies or a comedy show,

753
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.690
he'll bring half a cookie so we can enjoy the show more.

754
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.730
And why don't I want him to relax after work by vaping a bag and hanging out

755
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:27.080
with me.
Considering this habit has,
it hasn't hindered his life in any way?

756
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.540
Do I have a reason to be uneasy about this?

757
00:44:29.541 --> 00:44:33.810
I understand why he does it and he tells me it doesn't affect his feeling about

758
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:36.360
feelings about me and about us being together.

759
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:39.030
But it still makes me uneasy whenever I know he's high.

760
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.753
<v 3>MMM.</v>

761
00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.010
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
I mean if you don't like it,
you don't like it.
And if he enjoys it,</v>

762
00:44:46.011 --> 00:44:48.530
he enjoys it.
So you both know where you stand.

763
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.423
<v 3>MMM.</v>

764
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.420
<v 1>I gotta be honest.
I mean,
if someone was drinking every day,</v>

765
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:56.790
they would be probably an issue with that.

766
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.500
Although there's no medicinal purposes for,
uh,
alcohol is there,

767
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.740
unless they've taken an arrow out of your back.

768
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.840
Don't think like rub some on your gums or some shit.

769
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:09.120
I can't remember how it goes.
You take a shot.
Is that what it is?

770
00:45:09.121 --> 00:45:12.330
You bite down on a fucking garden hose?
I don't remember.

771
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.043
<v 3>MMM.</v>

772
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.740
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
if he's getting fucking begged all the time and he always,
you know,</v>

773
00:45:18.741 --> 00:45:22.040
so he'll enjoy it more.
Yeah.
That's a little bit of a red flag.
I,
you know,

774
00:45:22.041 --> 00:45:25.510
honestly if you fucking doing it every day and you never really sober and he

775
00:45:25.511 --> 00:45:29.660
just sort of constantly just sorta hi.
Um,

776
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.200
that's probably not a good way to go through life,
but it is his choice.

777
00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.860
I would just tell him,
just be like,
look,
I'm not saying you can't smoke,

778
00:45:36.861 --> 00:45:41.120
but like if you're high all the time and I'm sober,

779
00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:46.240
so I'm constantly talking to a buzzed you and um,

780
00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.710
it bothers me.

781
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.220
<v 3>Okay.</v>

782
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.790
<v 1>I would just tell him that and I think that it's going to bother him because</v>

783
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:57.300
when you fucking smoke weed like that,
it's a religion,

784
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.260
you know what I mean?
It's not like,
you know,

785
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:02.870
every day he comes home and he does this one little thing,

786
00:46:02.871 --> 00:46:06.110
puts his shoes in the wrong spot or some shit.

787
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:09.770
This is like you're talking about his state of consciousness when he's around

788
00:46:09.771 --> 00:46:13.010
you at all fucking times.
Basically you want them to alter that.

789
00:46:13.011 --> 00:46:15.140
So that's a kind of a major change.

790
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.013
<v 3>MMM.</v>

791
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.450
<v 1>You didn't tell me how old he was,
but,
um,
I dunno,</v>

792
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.380
I don't know much about weed.
I know some people say they get productive when,

793
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.960
when they're,
when they're using it and that type of stuff,
but,
uh,
I dunno,

794
00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:35.530
I really feel that,
you know,
and this is somebody who's like,

795
00:46:35.531 --> 00:46:37.750
realize that his drinking is out of control again.

796
00:46:37.751 --> 00:46:40.920
So I just sort of stopped for the last fucking three days.
Okay.

797
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.033
<v 3>MMM.</v>

798
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.180
<v 1>I mean,
I really have to watch it with myself.
Okay.</v>

799
00:46:46.181 --> 00:46:50.320
Because I have the kind of job where,
you know,

800
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:55.030
I can get fucked up every night basically,
and then sleep in the next day.

801
00:46:55.031 --> 00:46:55.661
Now granted,

802
00:46:55.661 --> 00:47:00.430
my career would suffer and I wouldn't get anywhere and eventually,

803
00:47:00.431 --> 00:47:02.590
you know,
but I mean,
I could do some before,

804
00:47:02.591 --> 00:47:06.010
like I might career totally did a fucking nose dive provided I didn't like,

805
00:47:06.011 --> 00:47:07.700
you know,
do something stupid like fucking,
you know,

806
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.450
get behind the wheel of a car,
fucking assault somebody.

807
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.600
If I was just getting drunk every day,
um,
yeah,

808
00:47:13.601 --> 00:47:14.890
that would affect where I was in the business.

809
00:47:14.891 --> 00:47:19.500
But it'd be like a long seven year,
like tapering off,
you know,

810
00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.930
back to doing the comedy vault at Remington's in Boston,

811
00:47:22.931 --> 00:47:24.460
which doesn't exist anymore.
But

812
00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:25.893
<v 3>MMM.</v>

813
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.580
<v 1>You know,
I,
I don't know.
I just personally,</v>

814
00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:32.150
I know I really got to watch it and my,
my,

815
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.260
my thing about people who smoke weed is the fact that they can be on it and

816
00:47:37.971 --> 00:47:41.590
nobody really knows,
like,
you know,
and one,

817
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.040
they high all the time,

818
00:47:43.041 --> 00:47:47.880
they're experienced being high and they can just go to work being high and,
uh,

819
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.720
you can't do that drunk.
He can't go to work like,
you know,

820
00:47:50.721 --> 00:47:54.590
shotgun a beer and walk in.
People just know it just doesn't work.

821
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.333
Um,

822
00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.850
but I'm not exactly 100% exactly against it the way I used to in the early days

823
00:48:01.851 --> 00:48:03.740
of this podcast when I didn't know a lot about it.

824
00:48:03.741 --> 00:48:05.960
Now I'm understanding that there's certain people,
you know,

825
00:48:05.961 --> 00:48:08.480
if they have really active minds,
I need to fucking chill out.

826
00:48:08.481 --> 00:48:11.920
It's actually a great thing,
um,
for them.
But I,

827
00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:14.780
I really think if you're doing it all the fucking time like that,
yeah.
Like,

828
00:48:14.781 --> 00:48:19.250
this is probably cause for an issue there,
you know,
to bring it up like,
hey,

829
00:48:19.251 --> 00:48:23.420
you kind of fucking basically wasted every time I talk to you.
And then also,

830
00:48:23.421 --> 00:48:26.440
you know,
that whole thing,
you know,

831
00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.160
he brings half a cookie so he can enjoy the show.

832
00:48:29.161 --> 00:48:32.280
It's like you can't enjoy it sober.
Like those are kind of some,

833
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:37.720
um,
red flags.
I Dunno.

834
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:41.630
And I also think that you can get addicted to that shit.
You know,

835
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.900
I think you're,
I think a guy is,
to be honest with you,
people always say Nah,

836
00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:49.950
you're not really addicted to it.
Oh yeah.
You just do it every waking moment.

837
00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:53.070
You can't fucking enjoy something unless you're under the influence of it.

838
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:54.690
There's something there.

839
00:48:54.691 --> 00:48:58.500
It's just because it's such a mellow thing and it's not like a,

840
00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.350
you know,
I got a bug in a buddy of mine from back in the day.
Dude,

841
00:49:03.351 --> 00:49:06.930
he's completely fucking addicted to that shit.

842
00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:12.130
He says I love weed cause it,
it turns my life into a movie.
And um,

843
00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:17.140
no,
he's basically been high since we were sophomores in high school.

844
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.300
Uh Huh.
Without a doubt.
It's fucked with his memory.
Without a doubt.
It's,

845
00:49:23.301 --> 00:49:27.390
it's fucked with his drive,
you know,

846
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:29.543
I dunno,

847
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:35.250
but I understand wanting to get fucked up every day.
Personally.

848
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.133
It's fun.

849
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.860
I think it was weird.
So easy.
A couple of puffs in.
Then boom,
you're there,

850
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.650
you know,
drink.
It takes it off.

851
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.400
I've got to stop talking about this or I'm going to have a drink.

852
00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:50.820
I'd set up to take a week off here,
so.
All right,
well good luck with that.

853
00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:55.670
I would just,
I would just say how you're feeling and if he gives,
you know,

854
00:49:55.671 --> 00:49:57.420
gives you shit back.
I just be like,
look,
give me,

855
00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.490
and I'm not being an asshole here.
You just like,
yeah,
high every day.

856
00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:05.300
Can you just like,
not be high a couple of days a week,

857
00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.510
but like how do you do that and not feel like you're infringing on this guy's

858
00:50:08.511 --> 00:50:11.030
fucking lifestyle?
I mean,
it's,
I dunno,
I would bring it up to him.

859
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:14.660
As I said 20 minutes ago before I meandered my way through that.

860
00:50:14.661 --> 00:50:17.840
Sorry about that.
Alright,
I fucked up.
Please advise.

861
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:22.370
Dear Billy ginger cakes.
I am a 26 year old fucking lazy.

862
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

863
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:28.000
<v 1>Who's a tremendous fan of your work and all its glorious forms.
Well,</v>

864
00:50:28.001 --> 00:50:30.120
thank you very much.
Uh,

865
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:34.600
that seen in efforts for family with the dad balls when bill is stuck under the

866
00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:38.200
bed is the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen.
Brilliant.
Well thank you.

867
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:41.170
I appreciate that.
Um,
I did,

868
00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:44.080
I did something really thin,
all capitals,

869
00:50:44.081 --> 00:50:49.081
really dumb and I would greatly appreciate your insight because I know you will

870
00:50:49.091 --> 00:50:52.870
tell me the ever elusive truth.
I won't tell you why.

871
00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.080
I'll tell you what I think is the truth,
whether it's the right answer.

872
00:50:56.081 --> 00:50:57.640
You got it.
You're going to decide that for yourself.

873
00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.300
I had been friends with this guy for about two years and now you're fucked him

874
00:51:01.301 --> 00:51:02.820
in your ruin the friendship.
That's what I'm about.

875
00:51:02.821 --> 00:51:06.400
So that's what I'm guessing here.
We met through a larger group of friends.

876
00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:11.110
There was chemistry between us immediately.
This guy is Sophie's married.

877
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:15.610
Trying to see where,
how,
how this can go off the rails.
This are,

878
00:51:15.611 --> 00:51:18.490
this is reading in the beginning,
like one of those dating sites,

879
00:51:18.491 --> 00:51:22.360
you know they play that stupid piano.
Udub,
but dude do that stupid.

880
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.210
<v 6>Ooh,</v>

881
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.410
<v 1>dumb Schiff
and see area killer.</v>

882
00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.460
There's could be a sex offender.
I don't know.

883
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.360
<v 6>No.
Ah,</v>

884
00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:41.620
<v 1>Metro,
larger group of friends.
There was chemistry between us immediately.</v>

885
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.460
This guy is so funny and so smart and fun to be around.

886
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.470
The problem is he has to penis.
I'm kidding.
She didn't write that.

887
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:54.580
But he's also a complete and total whore.
Oh Jesus.

888
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:59.230
Crushing it and good for him,
but exactly the wrong guy to get hung up on.

889
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.930
I knew I liked him too much.
I couldn't help it,

890
00:52:01.931 --> 00:52:03.640
but I thought I could handle being frank.

891
00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:08.320
Some friends with him and eventually eventually the feelings would pass.
Nah,
Nah,

892
00:52:08.321 --> 00:52:13.000
you can't be around guys like that.
This guy is a pussy getting son of a bitch.

893
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.650
Right.
Dracula would be like,
God damn it.
That guy's got game right.

894
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.630
And by all the,
all the ladies loved Dracula.

895
00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.720
He'd come up and start non on their fucking necks and that was it.

896
00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:26.960
Turn them into lady bats.
Right.
Then he kicked him to the curb,

897
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:30.010
cut himself another chick the next day.
Um,

898
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:34.480
we started hanging out a lot,
at least two or three nights a week.

899
00:52:34.481 --> 00:52:37.810
Sometimes he said things that made me think maybe he liked me too.

900
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:42.670
Then on my birthday we got drunk and had sex called it.
Oh,

901
00:52:42.671 --> 00:52:47.020
Jesus.
She says,
let me be clear.
He started it.

902
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.550
I just didn't stop it,
even though I knew it was a bad idea,

903
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.620
so I'm like a little kid.
He started it.
Um,

904
00:52:55.930 --> 00:53:00.700
the worst part is when I woke up the next morning in his bed,
in his bed,

905
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:05.230
he was gone.
Oh Man.

906
00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.110
He fled the fucking seen bill,

907
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.820
the dude shaped hole in the door.

908
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.620
What told me that he was freaked out.

909
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.440
The dude's shaped hole in the door.
He mean,
he was like,

910
00:53:23.441 --> 00:53:24.520
lily ran through the door.

911
00:53:24.521 --> 00:53:27.070
I think you left words out or I'm too fucking old to understand.

912
00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.800
Is that some new slang?
Uh,

913
00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:34.150
told me it was too freaked out and decide and I decided to give him some space.

914
00:53:34.151 --> 00:53:37.240
He called me four days later.
I don't remember the conversation.

915
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:42.040
When were you drunk?
But he said he'd call me back.
That was four months ago.

916
00:53:42.041 --> 00:53:45.370
Clearly he doesn't give a shit.
I get that,

917
00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:50.170
but I cannot understand how we could be so much in my life and then just never

918
00:53:50.171 --> 00:53:53.490
fucking talk to me again.
The fuck dude.

919
00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:57.220
The fuck you sound cool as hell.
By the way.
The more,

920
00:53:57.221 --> 00:54:01.060
the more immediate problem is that in a few weeks a mutual friend is having a

921
00:54:01.061 --> 00:54:04.330
birthday party and dude is going to because it's going to be there.

922
00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.810
What the fuck do I do,
Bill?
How do I face him?
Do I confront him?

923
00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:10.390
Do I ignore him a bugging out?
Please help me.

924
00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:14.170
Thank you in any advice in the law and he has got a golf.

925
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:17.310
I wish she was here this week.
Um,

926
00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:18.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

927
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:22.790
<v 1>All right.
Here's the deal.
All right.</v>

928
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:28.070
This isn't about him.
This is about you.
All right?
Be honest with yourself.

929
00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:32.750
Be kind of setting.
You knew what this guy was.
You knew who he was.
All right,

930
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.110
but he just had that fucking thing.
All right?

931
00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:40.700
You just had that fucking charisma or whatever and two year,
two years into it,

932
00:54:40.701 --> 00:54:44.840
you're drunk.
He started and you went through it,
the whatever,
you know,

933
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:49.190
he got freaked out and confirm what you knew all the time and he fucking left.

934
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:54.260
All right.
That'd be honest with me.
Do you want to fight that fight?

935
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:55.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

936
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.910
<v 1>Before you met this guy and you fantasize about the man you are going to marry,</v>

937
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.760
was this how it was going to play out?
Was this,

938
00:55:02.761 --> 00:55:05.100
does this something that you want to fucking deal with?

939
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:09.750
You realize you're going to have to like trying to bring this fucking fish in

940
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.340
the amount of heartache,

941
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.720
the amount of extra curricular activities and all that fucking shit that comes

942
00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:19.290
along with a guy like this?
Well,
why would you do that?

943
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.790
Why would you do that to yourself?
You don't need this shit.
All right.

944
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

945
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:28.010
<v 1>The problem is is you're,
you're trying to like,</v>

946
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.953
you're trying to,

947
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:32.120
<v 0>okay.</v>

948
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.740
<v 1>Like figure out the sanity in somebody insane behavior.</v>

949
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.593
Okay.

950
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:43.100
You knew what he was and then he confirmed it and now you're like,

951
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.860
does he mean this is exactly,
how could he just do that?

952
00:55:45.861 --> 00:55:49.070
Because he's a fucking load of 10 he's a load of tech.
Who knows?

953
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:53.450
Because his dad ran around on his mom because his mom took off on his dad.

954
00:55:53.451 --> 00:55:55.970
Who the fuck knows because it his bullshit,

955
00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:00.560
his giant truck load of fucking bullshit.
Okay.

956
00:56:00.561 --> 00:56:03.170
That he is still not even begun to deal with,

957
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:06.170
which is why he's behaving like that around you.

958
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:09.590
You don't fucking need that Jesus Christ.

959
00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:14.840
All the guys in the fucking world go to the party and have a good time.

960
00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:16.810
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

961
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:19.450
<v 1>just tell him just,
you know,
if you see him,
just say what's up.</v>

962
00:56:19.451 --> 00:56:24.190
No need to be weird.
Okay.
Over whatever we
had.

963
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:28.050
We had a good time.
It's fucking over.
I knew you were nuts.
Now you confirmed it.

964
00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:32.010
All right.
Stop fucking looking at me like you've seen a gold like I,

965
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:36.120
I would just go there and have a good time.
I wouldn't ignore him.

966
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:41.010
I wouldn't confront him.
I would just say hello and then I would go on.

967
00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.830
What's happening.
If he wants to talk,
talk to him.
If he doesn't,

968
00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.960
just go on with having a good time.
If you bump into them against,

969
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:51.820
say hello again,
but don't let that fucking guy ruin your good time.
Alright.

970
00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:57.770
And quit fucking wasted mental time trying to figure out his bullshit.

971
00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:03.960
He's not worth it.
Fuck up.
All right.
There you go.
Fuck them.
Hey,

972
00:57:03.961 --> 00:57:05.940
who knows?
You might meet Mr Right at that place.

973
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.180
<v 7>Ooh,</v>

974
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:12.110
<v 1>the everlasting love.
A documentary suggestion.</v>

975
00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:14.930
A dear Billy boo.

976
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.070
If you haven't seen the documentary on Netflix about the Ukraine revolution,

977
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.580
you should definitely check it out.
I would love to see that.
Um,

978
00:57:22.581 --> 00:57:24.530
it's called winter on fire.

979
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:26.120
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

980
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.830
<v 1>that sounds like a really bad 80 song.</v>

981
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:29.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

982
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.823
<v 7>Where do you,</v>

983
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:37.590
<v 1>oh,
is that cell saying almost far?
I can find some fucking Russians.</v>

984
00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:42.510
I don't like biting me a Putin.
I'm sorry.

985
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:47.010
In the immortal words of Ron Burgundy.
Wow.
That escalated quickly.

986
00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:49.320
My singing more the,
uh,
the documentary,

987
00:57:49.321 --> 00:57:53.880
it starts with some activists deciding to congregate in one place,

988
00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:58.830
which started as an event sent out on Facebook and ended up replacing their

989
00:57:58.831 --> 00:57:59.664
president.

990
00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:03.173
<v 0>Okay.</v>

991
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.350
<v 1>Every time I reached you like this,</v>

992
00:58:04.351 --> 00:58:09.351
like I am amazed at the human spirit and also feel so fucking lucky that I

993
00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:12.060
haven't had to experience that in a country,
you know?

994
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:13.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

995
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.220
<v 1>I then the country I live in,
we haven't gone through some shit like that.</v>

996
00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:19.670
Hopefully it will never fucking happen because I don't think I could stomach it.

997
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:21.080
You know,

998
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.960
hearing people running up and down the street and you'd just sit in there in the

999
00:58:23.961 --> 00:58:24.794
house

1000
00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.160
<v 7>who was in charge.</v>

1001
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.900
<v 1>Um,</v>

1002
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:33.640
the idea is so foreign to us and I think most people don't understand just how

1003
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:36.580
crazy it is.
Yeah.
I mean I don't,
I'm trying to wrap my head around it,

1004
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:39.040
but you are really good at seeing crazy shit.

1005
00:58:39.041 --> 00:58:41.380
No one notices that is right under our noses.

1006
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.610
So I think you'll be floored by this.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
What?

1007
00:58:44.611 --> 00:58:48.430
Thank you for the,
uh,
the recommendation.
I will definitely try to,
uh,

1008
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.090
check that out as soon as I can.
Is that all this shit?
Is that all the fucking,

1009
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:53.653
<v 0>okay.</v>

1010
00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:58.150
<v 1>What am I up to here?
58 minutes and 56 seconds,
I think.</v>

1011
00:58:58.151 --> 00:59:02.650
I could bullshit for another minute and call this a God damn day.

1012
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:07.240
Was it something else that I had to talk about here on the podcast?
Um,

1013
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.030
oh yeah.
I decided,
uh,

1014
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:14.050
I ran into a buddy of mine and he told me his new year's new year's resolution

1015
00:59:14.051 --> 00:59:14.201
was,

1016
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:17.890
he wasn't going to argue with his wife this year and he's made it all the way to

1017
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:18.940
February.
I was like,
you know what,

1018
00:59:18.941 --> 00:59:23.910
that's a really cool resolution and I haven't any this year.
So,
um,

1019
00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.670
I'm not giving up arguing with my wife,
uh,
for two reasons.
One,

1020
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:33.450
it would destroy my act into I'm a selfish son of a bitch.
Um,

1021
00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:37.340
I've lost,
I have no control over my fucking emotions.
I don't,
it's shameful,

1022
00:59:37.341 --> 00:59:40.670
but I don't.
Um,
so I decided instead,
I'm going to,

1023
00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:44.250
I'm trying to get back into learning French.
Uh,

1024
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:49.070
I feel like as I'm approaching,
you know,
the mid century mark here,

1025
00:59:49.071 --> 00:59:50.960
if I don't fucking do it now,
I'm going to be fucked.

1026
00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:55.130
I'm never going to learn how to do it.
Um,
so I'm fucking,
I'm back into it.

1027
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:58.370
I'm do a lingo.
I've done it three days in a fucking row.

1028
00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:02.480
And the only reason why I'm announcing it to you guys is because if you don't

1029
01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:05.810
hear me talking about it,
please break my balls to say that I fucking quit again.

1030
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.280
I'm a loser.
And all that type of Shell,

1031
01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:10.250
that wonderful positive shit that you guys can say anonymously,

1032
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.990
anonymously on the Internet.
Um
Oh,

1033
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:18.920
by the way,
you know,
you know it's funny in this fucking business,

1034
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:23.450
like they never tell the performer shit.
Right?
So I'm on stage this weekend.

1035
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:26.690
I got to ask you if there's any doctors out there.

1036
01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.210
I'm fucking onstage and I'm doing my act.
I don't even know what night it was.

1037
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:37.130
It might've been the first show last night
and the whole time I'm doing my act,

1038
01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:38.390
everything I fucking say

1039
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:44.870
some guy in the crowd is just like repeating it or commenting on it.

1040
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.280
You know what I mean?
Like not like cackling.
It's more like,
like black church,

1041
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:52.520
like call and response.
I was like,
yeah,
you know,

1042
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:54.860
I was walking down the street the other day and he says,
oh yeah,

1043
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.760
well I mean down the street,
you know,
doing that shit the whole fucking time.

1044
01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:03.430
But he's not so loud that the rest of the crowd can hear it.
Some hope.

1045
01:01:03.431 --> 01:01:05.580
And if I just ignore him,
he's going to stop and he doesn't.

1046
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.690
And finally after like a half an hour,
I was like,
dude,
when you shut the fuck up,

1047
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.170
you don't have to fucking comment on everything.
Is that all right?
All right.

1048
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:13.980
All right.
He's just doing that shit,
but I love you.

1049
01:01:13.981 --> 01:01:17.660
It's take saying shit like that and you know I was trashing them and all that

1050
01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:18.494
shit.

1051
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.560
So afterwards I ended up meeting him after the show and he ended up telling me

1052
01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:28.220
that he had Tourette's and then somebody on the show goes,
yeah,
yeah,

1053
01:01:28.221 --> 01:01:30.110
he had Tourette's.
We didn't know if he should throw them out.
It's like,

1054
01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.430
why don't you fucking tell me that before I make a fucking ass out of myself?

1055
01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:36.740
I felt terrible.
But here's my question,

1056
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:39.830
is that a former Tourette's at that Tourette's is either you're cursing your

1057
01:01:39.831 --> 01:01:44.831
brains out or you make weird noises or yet you do some sort of physical tick.

1058
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:49.430
I didn't know that you fucking,
all of a sudden we're doing that,
you know,

1059
01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:52.100
I'm in a Baptist church,
you know,

1060
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:55.040
except doing it in a way that eggs on the fucking speaker,

1061
01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:57.590
it actually annoys the shit out of it.
Well,
maybe that's my temperament.

1062
01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.590
I have no idea.
Um,

1063
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:04.650
that's my question for somebody out there in the medical field,
is that a,

1064
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.290
a form of Tourette's or was he just trying to make me feel bad?

1065
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:13.010
I'm literally yawning here like a fucking idiot.
Um,
all right.

1066
01:02:13.011 --> 01:02:15.860
That's the podcast for this week.
Oh,
Biz Billy.

1067
01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:20.430
No booze bag is back on the fucking wagon again.
Um,
I got to tell you,

1068
01:02:20.431 --> 01:02:22.140
as much as I fucking go up and down with that shit,

1069
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:26.940
at least I do nip it in the bud.
You know,
I,
uh,
I just drank too much.

1070
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:31.710
Was it Friday night?
Woke up fucking hung over.
Tired as shit.

1071
01:02:31.711 --> 01:02:34.050
I was just like,
what the fuck am I doing to myself is stupid.

1072
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:39.300
And then I watched black mask and I was watching them drinking Budweisers in

1073
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:42.990
1970s pull tab cans.
And I was like,
God,
I miss that.

1074
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.240
I miss it already.
All right.
All right.
That's a podcast for this week.

1075
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.410
Sorry.
Uh,
it was so late.
Um,

1076
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.100
if you'd like to contributed to this podcast,

anytime you go to Amazon,

1079
01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:04.410
You Click on the Amazon link and a,

1080
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:08.400
I get credit for driving people there and I give 10% of that shit to the Saint

1081
01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:13.401
Jude until you tell me that that one's a scam to everyone that I give to you

1082
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:16.230
guys eventually end up telling me that.
But I think this is a good one.
All right.

1083
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.970
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you on Thursday.
