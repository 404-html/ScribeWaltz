00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.160
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:07.090
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast full Monday,

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.840
uh,
March 4th,
2013.
How you doing?
How's it going?

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.710
You like this?
Is it up early?
I hope it is because I'm recording it.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.610
Uh,
on Sunday night right after watching the Bruins lose to the Canadians.

6
00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:25.030
Let's get that out of the way.
Congratulations Canadians.
You guys,
Canadian fans.

7
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:28.630
You guys deserve to win the game.
Fucking Bruins.
Jesus Christ.

8
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.530
You had the gay man.
You

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.470
<v 0>okay?</v>

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.710
<v 1>Oh my God,
they played,
they just fucking morons.</v>

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.260
<v 1>They played like they just fucking played right into the Canadians hands.</v>

13
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.490
We were up three to two for all.
You don't watch of,
um,
watch hockey.

14
00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:51.160
We were up to three to two and even though it was three to two,

15
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:56.020
we were carrying the play and we had commanded the game and then,
uh,

16
00:00:56.021 --> 00:01:00.220
the Canadian started getting chippy.
We fell right into it.
Fell right.

17
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:05.160
I got a good idea.
Chara take a fucking game misconduct day,

18
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.470
then I'll help the effort.

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.160
<v 1>I got to admit with nine minutes left,
I shut it off.
Once it was four to three,</v>

21
00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:14.340
I just shut the fucking thing off.
I was like,
it's,

22
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.940
you got to understand what the Bruins,
when Ciara is not on the ice,

23
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:22.960
it's like we pulled half our goaltender.
That's how important he is.

24
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:26.710
The place half the fucking game.
Yeah.
It was just a worse,

25
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.140
some fucking who gives a fuck player cross checks,
Sagan at the ice.

26
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.960
All right.
Whatever.
You know,

27
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.870
you don't like to see it,
but you're fucking go.

28
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.450
You got you take your head.
Can they take the helmet off?

29
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:46.480
What if they take the helmet off and then they start throwing punches?

30
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.940
At that point,
the D is still get the game is conduct.

31
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.100
I just don't understand how,

32
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.600
I just don't understand why you would do that.

33
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.730
Why would do you just basically gave them a 20 minute power play in the fucking

34
00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:03.270
third period for the simple fact that one of the best defenseman in the league

35
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.820
and the best guy we have in all the ICA eats up,

36
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:10.360
but he's not even going to be out there.
Um,
very stupid,
very stupid,

37
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.270
but Canadians are much better team than they were last year.

38
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:14.520
It was a great game and the Canadians didn't play the traps,

39
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.840
so it was fucking awesome hockey.

40
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.230
And I was surprised with the amount of fucking Canadian friends giving me shit

41
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.660
on Twitter who don't even know what the fucking trap is.

42
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:24.960
I thought you guys came out of the womb with skates on,

43
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.740
you know,
go on Youtube.
They'll show you what the fuck it is.
You'll see those.

44
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.210
I don't know why they stopped playing in play when they played the penguins

45
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:38.500
either.
That was seven to six.
It was a fucking awesome game up.

46
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.540
That's what I like.
You know,

47
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.620
you don't just do one sports fan that I can't stand is the fucking person who

48
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:50.620
complains about some shit and then when his team does it,
he goes,

49
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:52.030
well I don't give a shit.
You know,

50
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.610
that's like what the Canadian fans are doing with the fucking trap.

51
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:59.470
Like they weren't crying was a with boredom when they watch the devil's trap way

52
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.940
to fucking three cups.

53
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.370
<v 1>Were those not the most other than a Stevens was a great player to watch,</v>

55
00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:07.680
but other than I know a lot of people think he's dirty or whatever,
but I,
I've,

56
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.360
I've loved that guy.
But other than that,
I mean Jesus Christ.
I mean,
it was like,

57
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.810
I mean that we see almost the lose literally almost the end of the sport,

58
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.250
the whole,
the whole fucking game.

59
00:03:19.251 --> 00:03:22.700
One team would skate to about mid ice.

60
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.810
They dumped the pocket and the goaltender could skate over the corner.

61
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.190
You don't try to wrap it around the boards.

62
00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:31.400
The goalie could come over and stop it in the corner and then the defense would

63
00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:34.070
bring it up the fucking ice.
Oh my God.

64
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:37.490
God forbid the other team was playing it two and then they'd fucking try to dump

65
00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:38.600
and chase they called it.

66
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

67
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.970
<v 1>It,
it,
it was,</v>

68
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.190
it was almost the end of the league and fucking Nhl.
For some reason,

69
00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:51.110
NBA is smart enough to be like,
all right,
guys are too big.
They're too fast.

70
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.820
At the end of the day,

71
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.830
this sport is supposed to entertain fans and I don't watch enough hoop,

72
00:03:57.831 --> 00:04:01.100
but I know that there's a legal defenses and hope for the fucking life of me.

73
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:04.460
I don't understand why the NHL just goes,
hey listen guys,
stop playing that shit.

74
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.250
All right.
Just fucking play the way they used to play.
You know,
and let's,

75
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.140
let's have some nice rushes in that type of shit.
Going up and down the ice,

76
00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.660
couple of fights or whatever.
And let's get the fuck outta here.
So is that,

77
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:17.830
is that too hard?
Is that too hard?
It really gonna fucking get,

78
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.360
go up one goal and then sit back on your own fucking Blue Line of Waverly up

79
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.430
database.
A mistake.
Um,
I dunno,

80
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.860
I don't fucking know,
but I,
I really,

81
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.670
really disappointed in the Bruins for playing just right into their fucking

82
00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:36.110
hands.
Sitting in like an old man screaming at the TV.
Now

83
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.150
back to the bench.
What are you doing?

84
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.030
Why would you do that?

85
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.740
I think last time I saw Ciara fight,
I think,

86
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:54.060
I believe last time I watched it was in buffalo and he was just in the box for

87
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:58.590
five fucking minutes.
And we immediately became like,
uh,
like,
you know,

88
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.970
we look like a a 500 team.
Um,

89
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:04.200
it's not as bad now because we got,

90
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:07.710
we've got some other guys back there on defense,
but Jesus fucking Christ.

91
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.230
So I gotta be honest with you,
I don't know what to to,

92
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.710
to take away from that game because I can't really say that we saw the Canadians

93
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:17.070
cause a price wasn't a net and uh,

94
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.250
you know,
and then shower takes that stupid fucking penalty.

95
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:25.270
So he didn't play a third of the game.
I Dunno.
I still think we're a better team.

96
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:27.900
So I feel good and I look at Montreal and that they look like a,

97
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:30.940
a second round of the playoffs going to get bounced out.
What's,

98
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:35.680
you'll make me happy then that'll be 22 seasons,
21 years without a cup.

99
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.780
And just with every year they look more and more like Matthew mcconaughey in

100
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:44.080
dazed and confused.
Like,
it's fucking over and they don't realize it yet.

101
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.500
You know,
I mean,
Jesus fucking Christ,

102
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.470
they still walk around arrogantly,
Canadian fence do like living off of like,

103
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.710
you know what they like at this point that like trust fund kids,

104
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.641
you know,

105
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:05.420
like their grandfather made all the money and now they're riding around this

106
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:09.320
Maserati that like interest paid for and then they are looking at you like this,

107
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.320
some sort of success and you're looking like,
dude,
you haven't done shit.

108
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.860
You haven't done shit in your life.
What do you puffing your chest out for?

109
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.450
You know,

110
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.720
in your high school jacket with all your grandfather's accomplishments written

111
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:22.250
up and down the fucking sleeves.

112
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.710
Do you remember that championship they won back in 1958?
You don't,
you can't.

113
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.520
Seriously,
you know,
I'll listen.

114
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.430
I'll take shift from Canadian fans that are like my age because I don't know

115
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.850
that they remember the,
uh,
the Patrick wa championships,

116
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:40.640
but these punks in their twenties right up to their early thirties.

117
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.940
You guys can all go fuck yourselves because I know you don't remember anything.

118
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.680
Even last time the Canadians won it.
You were upstairs in your lead jam jams,

119
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.670
you know,
getting ready to have some dreams.
So go fuck yourselves.
All right.

120
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:57.350
With your most overrated run of championships.
Oh,
let's start an argument here.

121
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.230
I'll ask you guys this.
What do you think

122
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.670
when I already congratulated the Canadians for winning,
right?
Did I do that?

123
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:08.360
So I'm not being a total country here.
I just love shitting on him.
Um,

124
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.180
what do you think is the most overrated,

125
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.850
overrated collection of like,
you know,
championships?
Uh,

126
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.610
the Celtics,
the Boston Celtics,

127
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.400
the 11 that they want in the 1960s,
uh,

128
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.840
the New York Yankees.
Oh,
the Montreal Canadians.

129
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.060
I would,
I would put them in this order.
I would say Canadians top of the list.

130
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.950
Then I would say Celtics.
And then I would say Yankees,

131
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.440
you know,
and this,
this is why,
okay.

132
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:47.441
The Canadians dominated a 16 league and they had first choice of every French

133
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.380
born Canadian player for like the first fucking 50 years.

134
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.360
It's like they had their own lottery draft every fucking year.

135
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.170
All right.
And that dimension,
there's five other teams.
I mean,

136
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:03.920
give me a fucking really,
you went on a run.
Holy Shit.
How did you do that?

137
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.830
You know,
then I would say,

138
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.280
I would say the only reason why I'm putting the Celtics next is because the

139
00:08:13.591 --> 00:08:17.790
Yankees basically had Jordan.
They there,

140
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:21.840
there was such a good front office that they grabbed the Jordan three

141
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:24.840
generations in a row,
you know,

142
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.310
I mean we gave him fucking Babe Ruth like assholes because we wanted to have a

143
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:33.870
musical.
I think people should think too,
right.
So we give him babe Ruth,

144
00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:37.830
but they had Lou Gehrig.
They went from Lou Gehrig,

145
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.890
Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig to fucking Joe Dimaggio to Mickey Mantle.

146
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.480
Um,
there,
I don't,
I'm good.
I don't think you ever going to see that again.

147
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.290
That would be like if one team drafted a,
you went doctored,

148
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.300
the sixers got doctor j and then they fucking Michael Jordan and then they

149
00:08:57.391 --> 00:08:59.640
drafted like Colby Bryant or Lebron,

150
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.730
like within like what does that like 30 years within 30 years from the 1920s,

151
00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:05.970
the 1950s they had that.

152
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:09.870
So I put the Celtic second because I'm,

153
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.880
I know,
I guess it was a newer league.
Well the league started in the forties,

154
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:16.380
but it was still the 1960s.

155
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:20.250
It was still there was will Chamberlain but all those championships back then

156
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:24.750
though,
the amazing thing about it was the like the amazing argument.
It's like,

157
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:28.290
okay,
well it's distilled down.
So there's,
there's uh,

158
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.170
the talent level obviously should have been higher I guess.

159
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.770
But for some of you youngsters out there,

160
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.560
like back in the day when you won the pennant in baseball,

161
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:41.220
there was so few teams,
I should have done my research.
I used to know this shit.

162
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:45.720
There was like literally like maybe 17 in each,
um,

163
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.040
in each league.

164
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.360
So it was basically winning the pennant

165
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.340
was having the best record at the end of the regular season that was winning the

166
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.380
pennant.
And if you had the best record in the American league,

167
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:02.090
you immediately went to the world series.
There was no wildcard,

168
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.870
no divisional series,
and then the fucking a LLCs,
you immediately,

169
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.060
you went to the world series.

170
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:14.061
So basically after you won all those games in the regular season,

171
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.870
you had to win four more.
Um,
and I think that that's why you,

172
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.060
you saw teams go on.
I don't know.

173
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:27.090
I think that that's why you saw like a Yankees,
a Celtics or a,

174
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.860
a Canadian staying where they could go on runs because there was so,

175
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.790
there was way fewer teams and you had in even like the playoffs,

176
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.980
playoffs was,
was so much shorter.
Like I was talking to my buddy law yet,
he said,

177
00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:40.140
yeah,

178
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.580
the amount of times that the Cleveland Indians won over a hundred games and they

179
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:47.210
didn't even make the playoffs because the Yankees had a couple more wins.

180
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.990
Um,
and you know how the playoffs go?
Anybody can fucking,

181
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:54.000
when you have a bad day or a bad couple of games,
next thing say,

182
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:56.420
know you bounced out in the first fucking round or a hundred wins,

183
00:10:56.421 --> 00:10:59.540
go right down the toilet.
That didn't happen back then.
So,
uh,

184
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.820
I will be interested to hear,
but I mean,

185
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:06.410
I think obviously just the sheer number of teams and then that unbelievably

186
00:11:06.411 --> 00:11:10.520
ridiculous advantage that the Canadians had that they had first choice of every

187
00:11:10.521 --> 00:11:14.780
French board,
Canadian player,
you know,
I mean,
what the fuck?

188
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.940
Um,
but anyways,
anyways,

189
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.500
go and I,
and I promise you this,
that the Bruins ever start playing the trap.

190
00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:28.560
I will immediately stop watching them,
uh,
because I,

191
00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.930
I like the game of hockey.
I don't like watching it being suffocated.

192
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.420
All Right,
Bill,
you've made you God the employee.

193
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:36.770
How long did I talk about hockey?

194
00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:40.460
And I can guarantee you there's no women left listening to this fucking thing.

195
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.580
11 minutes.
Does that sound all right?
I'm back to my old contraption here.

196
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.200
I bought yet another memory card.

197
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:53.201
Somebody on Twitter told me that the lovely zoom h four n recorder could take

198
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:56.560
one that had 32 gigabytes or some shit.

199
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.590
So I went out and I bought one of those and I stuck it in there and they said

200
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:03.520
that there was nothing in there.
So,
uh,
I don't know if I had a fish tank.

201
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.190
That's where this record would be at the bottom of it cause it kind of looks

202
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:10.710
like one of those castles that the goldfish swim swim in and out of.
Um,

203
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.140
all right,
let's get on with the podcast.
This is the Monday morning podcast.

204
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:16.200
Everybody.
I'm,

205
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.470
I'm actually in a great fucking move despite the fact that my Bruins lost.

206
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.780
Um,
have you ever had I was telling you how tight it showed me how to uh,

207
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.880
or basically did the job and then just stood over my shoulders.

208
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:31.870
I did the other one when we converted my front brakes from drum brakes to disc

209
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:32.470
brakes.

210
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.830
So I've had those drum brakes in my garage saying that I was going to put those

211
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:38.420
motherfuckers together and uh,

212
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.770
and they just been sitting there mocking me every time I'm walking by like,

213
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:46.330
what's up bitch?
What's up bitch?
What Titus isn't here to fucking hold your hand,

214
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:50.980
your little fucking pussy.
And we tell him we saw him,
they were bugging me.

215
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:56.860
So,
uh,
I went on,
I went on the Internet there,
I went to amazon.com.

216
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.521
That's what I did.

217
00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.160
Everybody write through the Bill Berg website and the podcast page.

218
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:00.994
I clicked on it.

219
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.150
I actually got money kicked back to me that I'm going to kick on to the troops

220
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.430
and I bought the kit.
Um,

221
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:09.790
<v 0>okay.</v>

222
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.460
<v 1>You know,
to help you put the fucking springs on and all that shit.</v>

223
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:14.230
So underrated for this week.

224
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.650
Actually having the tools for the job that you need.

225
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:20.740
Cause I watched all these guys these weekend warriors going like,
you know,

226
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:24.490
there's just,
there's a special tool for this,
but if you don't have it,
uh,

227
00:13:24.491 --> 00:13:28.030
you know,
a needle nose pliers,
we'll work,

228
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.060
get yourself a screwdriver and a no go out and get the fucking things that you

229
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:37.600
need.
And uh,
I actually got them all together.

230
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:40.330
I think I fucked up one of the springs.
I think one of them,

231
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.750
cause when I got told the last spring that was left,

232
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.740
it didn't seem like it fit right.
So I'm going to bring it down to the guy,

233
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.750
works on my truck normally and have him show me how to fucking do it.

234
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:55.090
But I was psyched.
I probably,
I'll put a picture up of what I,

235
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.380
what I have done so far.

236
00:13:56.381 --> 00:14:00.460
I've got it basically three quarters done and I have some extra parts,

237
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:04.450
some clips and a couple of screws.
So I'm like 80% there.

238
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.770
And um,
I dunno,
I think I breathed in a bunch of,

239
00:14:09.771 --> 00:14:10.640
especially this too.

240
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.890
I didn't realize actually I did and I was like,
Hey,
I'm outside,
I'm fine.

241
00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:21.800
And then I've got this words,
I already had a scratchy feeling in my throat.

242
00:14:21.801 --> 00:14:23.720
I thought I was catching a cold,
but now it feels like,

243
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.030
and it's best to see kind of cold.
Um,

244
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:28.820
<v 0>okay.</v>

245
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.320
<v 1>But anyways,
man,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm psyched.</v>

246
00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:31.820
I'm going to get these fucking things together.

247
00:14:31.821 --> 00:14:34.310
Cause remember that carburetor I told you I took apart,

248
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.430
I tried and I was going to rebuild it.
I went nuts.

249
00:14:37.431 --> 00:14:40.730
I took the whole fucking thing apart.
Right down to those,
those little flat,

250
00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:43.550
it was a four barrel right down on those little flapper things.

251
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.020
I know what you call them,
but I took them out and now they won't fit back in.

252
00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:51.110
Cause I think all the years of it just being so hot,
they were a little warped.

253
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.680
I can't get a back end.
So if anybody knows where I can buy those parts,

254
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.250
I don't mean like a rebuilt,
rebuilt kit.
I have all that shit.

255
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.530
I need the actual parts to the carburetor and a,

256
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.050
it's making me sick every time I look at it.
Um,

257
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.320
cause that's literally the first thing I have to put back together and I can't

258
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:12.500
get him.
I can't get them to fit.
Um,

259
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.300
so if anybody knows where I can order that shit,
I'd appreciate it.
All right.

260
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.980
All right.
What the fuck am I talking about this week?
Um,
you know,

261
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:20.310
I went to go look at a,
uh,

262
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.970
a story on the Internet that I somehow missed because I've been traveling so

263
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:30.170
much.
And one of the advertising,
the advertising before,

264
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:34.540
like the little youtube video was uh,
Oh,
before I forget,
I got,

265
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.970
I'm going to post the,
uh,

266
00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:40.550
the youtube video of this southern dude who was doing the drum brakes on his

267
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:44.780
buddies Mustang that actually taught me how to do it.
The guy's a fucking riot.

268
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.070
He knows what he's doing,

269
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:50.000
but he's drinking the whole time and every time he takes a sip he goes chairs.

270
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.950
And it was,
he just,
he filmed it in real time,
so he fucked up,

271
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.300
you know,
a couple of times,
had to take some shit off.
You know,

272
00:15:58.301 --> 00:16:00.770
you just put some shit on too soon or whatever and then,
you know,

273
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.950
kind of had to go back and forth.
But just watching a guy,

274
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.920
he just left the camera on.
It was really great.

275
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:10.910
So if you've ever thinking of doing it,
if a dumb ass like me configure it out,

276
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.450
sort of,
you know,
I'm not looking to lie to you.
I had some extra parts,

277
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.520
but after tomorrow when I go down in the garage,

278
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.920
the guy's going to show me what I did wrong and I'm going to have it down and

279
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:23.480
I'll do the other one and I know how to do it.

280
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.290
So I'll definitely post that video.
And,
um,
so anyways,

281
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:28.910
um,

282
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.650
this advertising comes on right before this new story that I somehow missed.

283
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.070
And,
um,

284
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.080
it shows this guy out on a lake on a jet ski or something like that.

285
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.520
And these two ladies sitting on the bench on the beach,
I mean,

286
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:45.740
and they go,
uh,
she goes,

287
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:49.180
so when one of the lady says to the woman who's married to the guy and the jet

288
00:16:49.181 --> 00:16:53.290
ski,
so does he still keep it in the driveway?
And she's like,
not any mar,

289
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.060
you know.
And like now that it's like in storage,

290
00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.380
it was basically an advertising advertisement for storage,
right?

291
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.210
So of course,
you know,
the storage companies,

292
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.920
they're basically advertise into fucking ladies out there because what,

293
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.950
what a what a women do.
The second you get married to them,
you know,

294
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.690
they take over the fucking house.

295
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:18.590
And all your shit ends up out in the garage and if there's anything that sits in

296
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:22.610
the driveway,
how long before they want you to sell it?
You know what I mean?

297
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.760
Did they give a fuck that it's the last fucking flame flickering in your heart.

298
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.490
You know something.
You have a passion for an old car.

299
00:17:31.491 --> 00:17:35.150
You want to fix up a fucking jet ski,
right?

300
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.450
And this fucking woman is sitting there gloating.

301
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.230
There's guys out on the lake cabin the fucking time of his life when this God

302
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:47.180
damn Jetski she sees how much she enjoys it.
Does she give a fuck?
No.

303
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:48.890
It's a fucking eyesore to her.

304
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.920
I really don't understand how women have like that motherly thing with,

305
00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.190
they're like these absolute angels and at the same fucking time they,

306
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.730
they're like these,
I don't know what they are.

307
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.680
What is the fucking word?
It's not like a Leech.
They're like these,
uh,

308
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

309
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.280
<v 1>I Dunno.
What does that old thing where a calf,
a cat sleeps on your chest,</v>

310
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:16.560
it steals your life breath or something like that.

311
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.860
Or is that when you hold the milk in front of your mouth and a fucking tape worm

312
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:22.870
comes out,
I can't lose something of this sounds something somewhere in there.

313
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.530
Yeah,
somewhere in there.
There's,
there's a reference.

314
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:29.260
That would have been funny three minutes ago.
Sorry.
Um,

315
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:30.950
<v 0>okay.</v>

316
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.710
<v 1>I just don't understand it.
That's why we need is this shit.</v>

317
00:18:33.711 --> 00:18:36.110
And he doesn't give a fuck.
I got my drum stuff,
my guitar stuff.

318
00:18:36.111 --> 00:18:39.980
She knows I'm a big kid and she lets me have it.
She's never said,
oh,

319
00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:43.610
why don't you take your shit and put it in storage,
you know?

320
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.390
But all these fucking women they show in these advertisings and all these

321
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.940
fucking sitcoms and shit.
I don't know.

322
00:18:52.941 --> 00:18:55.610
I just don't understand it.
Why,
why?
You know,
at the end of the day,

323
00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:59.060
you know who's fault it is.
It's the fucking guy in the jet ski.

324
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.010
You know when,
when she's sitting there breaking his fucking balls,
there's,

325
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.300
there's,
there's,

326
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.440
there's a great line that you can use when you're just sick of your woman.

327
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.400
She's just crossed too many lines and she's on a fucking role and she's gone.

328
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.890
And now I think,
yeah,
you get that yet.

329
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.490
And My mother is coming to town and he'd taking up all that space.

330
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:25.920
We need Rumford backyard a bunch.
She's on a fucking role.

331
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.580
There's a great simple thing that you could say to them,

332
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.290
you know,
to make them stop.
It's basically this all,
all right.
All right.

333
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.953
<v 0>Okay.</v>

334
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.360
<v 1>That's what you do.
And then you sit in the awkward silence.</v>

335
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.470
So you're yelling at me now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why are you doing that?

336
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.280
Because you're fucking annoying me.
Tell her,
cursing me.
I'm not cursing at you.

337
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.150
I'm cursing because I'm angry.
It's my fucking jet ski.
I enjoy it.

338
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.310
I like going out in the fucking leg,
doing little looky loose.
Oh,

339
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.560
little dosey doe,
whatever,
whatever the fucking slang is on jet skis.

340
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.630
I liked doing it.
Okay.

341
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.400
And I don't have to haul my ass all the way down to the fucking storage shed on

342
00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:09.590
the other side of town.
Every time I feel like taking a lap around the lake.

343
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.400
Why don't we put some of your fucking shoes down there?
How about that?
No,

344
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.210
no.
Shut up shop while you're talking.

345
00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:20.360
When I'm talking then that that's why that fucking word exists.

346
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.850
You shut your face lady.
All right.

347
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.410
My jet ski goes down to the Fucking,
uh,
storage center.

348
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.470
So to some of your,
your,
uh,
sort of some of your shoes.

349
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.120
Fucking only my jet ski.
Only my shit goes down.
They,

350
00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:36.960
what kind of fucking lopsided trade is this?

351
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.560
Like I'm dismantling the team of my life.
Go Fuck Yourself.

352
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:43.440
You got to give somebody else to give somebody else up.

353
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

354
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.650
<v 1>There we go.
See that?
That's why,
you know,
I don't know if this,</v>

355
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.040
this kind of shits gonna cause me to live longer,
uh,
dire earlier,

356
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.640
but literally that's what a 14 second advertisement can fucking do to me.

357
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.050
I get upset at this,

358
00:20:56.051 --> 00:21:00.480
this hypothetical fucking relationship and this guy who was on this just jet ski

359
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.880
and goes into a green screen storage door.

360
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.530
I don't know if there's any women who's still listening to this.

361
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.890
Can you please answer me like two things.

362
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:16.870
What do you have against the guy you're with having fun without you?
And two,

363
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.880
what is it that guys do?

364
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.450
What is the male equivalent to doing that?

365
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.590
Because I know we balanced each other out at this point.
Okay.
But I'm,
I'm a guy,

366
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:30.490
so I only see,
you know,
I'm like a homer announcer.

367
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.720
I only see the fucking offenses that are on my side,
you know,

368
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.260
uh,
that affect me.
It really just,
just the way they said now,

369
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.380
begging is down,
crash this street.
Oh fuck you.

up blue,
but oh,

424
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:08.540
what those five puts good.
Has any body shame?

425
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:13.541
My Gal that if you run into a five two covered with pearls,

426
00:25:14.291 --> 00:25:18.610
bum,
bum,
bum,
diamond rings and all those things,
you bet your life.
It isn't her.

427
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.790
But could she loved,
could she cool?

428
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.950
Could she could she could [inaudible] seed my and my hair.

429
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.710
It was orange.
Is it any,
is it any wonder?

430
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.760
I ended up doing this shit,
talking to myself in the basement of my fucking home.

431
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.450
Oh by the way,
I finally got the roof put on my house.

432
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.430
Love in life as one of those things that you absolutely love and your girl could

433
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:47.720
give a fuck about.
I'm standing up there,
you know,
just staring at it,

434
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.420
talking to Nia.
Look at it.
Look at the fucking top paper.
Right?

435
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:57.350
She could give a shit.
She's like,
yeah,
yeah.
It's nice.
It's very nice.

436
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.850
It's going to keep it like 15 degrees cooler.
We used to have the black,

437
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:03.680
now it's a white that was white.
You know,

438
00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:05.630
it's going to reflect light rather than attracting.

439
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.830
Do you understand what's going on?
Yeah,

440
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.270
that's tar paper.
All right.

Everybody else was singing,
you know,

468
00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:56.040
like sweet emotion and I'm walking around going roll out the barrel.

469
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:00.390
What lab?
A barrel of fun.
We got it.
Bill,
you'll listen to a bad record.

470
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.380
All right.
So anyways,

471
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.770
here it was a new story that I sudden somehow missed out on.
Um,

472
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.630
I've been living a very,
a cavernous life recently.
Um,

473
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.870
I've been really busy so I've missed out on a lot of,
uh,

474
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.160
<v 0>okay.</v>

475
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.340
<v 1>A lot of stories.
I don't,
how the fuck did I miss out on this?</v>

476
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:25.341
And Jim Norton actually did a bit about this on the Patrice O'Neal benefit and I

477
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:29.130
missed it cause I was,
I was in the back somewhere and making sure,
you know,

478
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.030
freaking out,
making sure everybody had food and all that dynamic range.

479
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:36.420
One of those things before.
So,
you know,
I was,
I was,
uh,

480
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:37.670
it was like that fucking nerd who,

481
00:28:37.671 --> 00:28:40.920
who had a party and was worried that no one was going to show up or they'd show

482
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:44.130
up and say,
that sucked.
I guess he did a story on this.

483
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.160
It's an a man charge was slapping a toddler on a Minneapolis to Atlanta flight

484
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:51.330
is out of a job.

485
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.530
This guy got up and he slapped a baby and the baby was African American and he

486
00:28:57.871 --> 00:28:59.130
dropped the n word.

487
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:00.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

488
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.633
<v 1>I mean,</v>

489
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:07.570
I've been trying to fig like that's gotta be like as far as ending your career,

490
00:29:08.751 --> 00:29:13.510
that's like just,
I mean,
I don't know how you could've done it any better.

491
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.200
Like if you truly just wanted to get fired,
I mean,

492
00:29:17.201 --> 00:29:22.090
you could have stopped with slapping a baby.
That is Jay,

493
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.960
let me,
that is just,
I can't,
I'm,
can you fucking,
you haven't been on a plane.

494
00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.400
The baby starts crying.
I always get blown away by people who get annoyed by it.

495
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.650
I always find it funny and relatable.
Like when I hear a baby start crying,

496
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:41.030
I just think like,
I just,
I'm,
I'm jealous of the freedom of it.

497
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.150
I want to do that too.
Like how great that would be.
Just anytime.

498
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:50.090
It just,
life started to suck.
He doesn't do that.

499
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.550
You know how all my God,

500
00:29:52.551 --> 00:29:55.430
I should be like verse pullovers he has a bit just so I gotta stop paupers

501
00:29:55.431 --> 00:29:58.220
versus he has a bitches like this.
Oh wait,
I gotta stop here.

502
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.030
Go See Paul Versey for the rest of this fucking ideas.
Oh my God.

503
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.360
Accidentally almost stumbled into that one.
Um,

504
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.840
but I've,
I've always felt that though.

505
00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

506
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:14.800
<v 1>Can you fucking believe going up?
It's slapping.</v>

507
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.460
Forget the whole racial thing.
Just standing up.

508
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:25.250
I mean,
we've all had a couple of drinks.
We've all said some things.
You know,

509
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.180
how many fucking drinks do you have?
Well,
you,
your brain goes,

510
00:30:29.181 --> 00:30:32.300
why don't you go over there and slap that bitch fucking head?

511
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.280
I can see if you were driving by and there was a baby standing on the street

512
00:30:37.281 --> 00:30:39.680
corner and you took the plates off your car,

513
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.340
I could see in your drunk mind thinking that you are going to get away with
that.

514
00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.950
But this guy,
if you did that in the mall,
it would be over.

515
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.670
This guy does it on a plane.
There's no where to go.
There's nowhere to go.

516
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

517
00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.910
<v 1>Yeah.
You know what,
when they make the sequel to like snakes on a plane,</v>

518
00:30:55.911 --> 00:30:57.200
they sh this is what it should be.

519
00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:02.230
It should be Sam Jackson is a baby in some racist white guy slaps him in the

520
00:31:02.331 --> 00:31:07.120
face and,
and calls him the n word and then that it just sets him on.

521
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.440
That guy's actually part of the Illuminati.

522
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.650
I'm just throwing shit against the wall.
That guys,

523
00:31:12.651 --> 00:31:16.850
part of the Illuminati and the reason why he's on a commercial airline flight
is,

524
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:21.830
uh,
maybe he got a little too out of control at the last secret meeting.

525
00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:25.190
He didn't do the handshake.
Right.
You know,
and the,
as a punishment,

526
00:31:25.191 --> 00:31:30.191
he actually had to fly commercial like FirstClass and uh,

527
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.510
<v 0>okay.</v>

528
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.560
<v 1>And it's actually it's a baby Sam Jackson.</v>

529
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:35.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

530
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.650
<v 1>And,
and it's whatever snakes on a plane.
Snakes meaning like the Illuminati,</v>

531
00:31:39.651 --> 00:31:42.530
like they're pieces of shit snakes on a plane,
part two.

532
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.580
And in the the tag is you just slapped the wrong motherfucker.

533
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.090
I'm sorry.
Sometimes this shit's just funny to me,
but um,

534
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.450
oh and then he drops the n word.
I mean Jesus,
I mean this guy is just like,

535
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.520
it's just as far as evil,
it would be like,
I can't even imagine.

536
00:32:05.521 --> 00:32:08.580
It would be like getting eaten by a snake and a shark at the same time.

537
00:32:08.581 --> 00:32:13.140
Like I wouldn't be possible.
Like the level of evil that is in that man's heart.

538
00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.600
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

539
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.820
<v 1>You know,
Jesus,
I'm trying to like,
he's sick.</v>

540
00:32:18.821 --> 00:32:21.250
He's a 60 year old guy from Idaho

541
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:28.100
and I even think the 60 is too young at this point to still be dropping the n

542
00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:31.110
word.
You know,
you get somebody at this point,
let's see,
60 years old,

543
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.730
you were black,
you know,
Nah,
you were born in the fifties come on man,

544
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.950
you're born to fit.
You should know better.
All right.

545
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.520
Even white guy in the middle of nowhere,
you should know better.

546
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:48.080
So I feel like the,
the the white person dropping the n word kind of Shit,

547
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:49.760
even though I know there's a bunch of hate groups out there,

548
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:54.020
I'm just talking to the average everyday Joe just on a fucking plane saying that

549
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:57.420
type of shit.
That's like a,
you know,
at this point I think you,

550
00:32:57.421 --> 00:33:02.421
you were born in like the twenties and the thirties maybe the forties may Bill

551
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.990
Clinton was in the forties right?
He's played saxophone on our Cineo Hall.

552
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.610
I don't even did the cool handshake.
Right.
White people have come a long way.

553
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.610
This guy just set white people back.

554
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.360
The only thing that's saved that he's an old white guy and I think people always

555
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:21.440
just look at old people is like they were born in the 18 hundreds at least I do.

556
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.690
Maybe that's me cause I'll be 45 this year and I just realized that I'm 15 years

557
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:31.310
away from being 60 years old.
And you know what,
I'm all right with that.
You know,

558
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.820
I make salads,
I'm doing pull ups,
go fuck yourself.
All right.
Um,

559
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:40.190
it's not like I'm aging any quicker than anybody else.
We all listen,

560
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:44.150
we all get a day older every day.
Okay.

561
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.110
Now the great thing about being my age is if the fucking we get hit by an

562
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:51.440
asteroid,
I got 45 years in.
All right,

563
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.890
you only got 20 [inaudible] but they're,
they're great.
20 years,
your first 20,

564
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.320
now they think of it.
You don't have to deal with a bunch of other shit that you,

565
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.010
I don't know.
But let's does this,
this is kinda gone off the rails here.
Um,

566
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.060
so I apologize.
Like I really missed out on a bunch of stories.
I don't,

567
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.560
I just kind of,

568
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.560
obviously as you can tell from the first 11 minutes of this podcast,

569
00:34:12.561 --> 00:34:17.561
all I do is watch hockey and then try and put together auto parts while

570
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:23.060
breathing in a [inaudible],
um,

571
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.240
embattled,
Scottish,
Cardinal O'Brien,

572
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:31.220
Cardinal O'brien apologizes for my sexual conduct.
You know,

573
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:36.221
I'm getting sick of people apologizing for shit and they dance around this guy

574
00:34:36.561 --> 00:34:41.330
basically to use my new word,
he buggered some kids.
All right?

575
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:46.190
He took out his holy Cock Oleo and stuck it in their fucking,
uh,

576
00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.080
uh,
uh,
what the fuck was Jesus born in a shed?

577
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.250
What are they always call it,
you know,
are always around Christmas.

578
00:34:55.251 --> 00:34:57.650
I remember what it's called.
What was he boys born in a barn,

579
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:00.470
but they give it some biblical,
what's the name for a Biblical Barn?

580
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.810
I don't give a fuck.
Anyways,

581
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:06.770
it says the Scottish cardinal who had earlier earlier challenged allegations of

582
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:11.771
his sexual impropriety claims that once again claims that once again shine an

583
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:17.370
international spotlight and the alleged alleged sexual abuse evolving row

584
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.170
involving Roman Catholic clergy reverse course Sunday.
And the guy,

585
00:35:22.171 --> 00:35:26.960
I apologize,
this is how we apologizes for basic I for as far as I can tell,

586
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:31.100
fucking children in the ass.
He said,

587
00:35:31.101 --> 00:35:36.080
I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my

588
00:35:36.081 --> 00:35:41.081
sexual has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest,

589
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.650
archbishop and Cardinal.

590
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.050
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

591
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.010
<v 1>In recent days,</v>

592
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:51.810
certain allegations which have been made against me have become public initially

593
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:56.811
there are anonymous and nonspecific nature led me to contest them to those I

594
00:35:57.181 --> 00:35:58.020
have offended.

595
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.180
I apologize and ask forgiveness to those.

596
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.520
I've offended.
You know,

597
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:10.610
I've been lucky enough in my life to have never been unwantedly fucking banged

598
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:15.900
in the ass by a fucking priest.
But I know,

599
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:20.901
I think I can be empathetic enough and say that if this was happening,

600
00:36:21.661 --> 00:36:23.730
at no point would I be turning around going,
you know,

601
00:36:23.731 --> 00:36:27.960
that's what you're doing is really offensive.
I find this,

602
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.640
you know what the fuck?

603
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.100
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

604
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.280
<v 1>When you apologize,
you should have to say what the fuck you did.</v>

605
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.780
And if you're going to talk like this,

606
00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:40.781
there should be somebody obnoxiously yelling off the mic like what you did like

607
00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.370
during this paulagy should have been like,

608
00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.930
I wish to take each opportunity to admit that there have been times that my

609
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:52.950
sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest.

610
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.080
Yeah.
And it's a fucking human being.
You're not supposed to fuck kids.

611
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.120
And regent days,

612
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:04.630
certain allegations fucking of children which have been made against me have

613
00:37:04.731 --> 00:37:05.564
become public.

614
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:10.570
Bob Flock and tie and naturally there are not miss and nonspecific nature led me

615
00:37:11.181 --> 00:37:15.020
to contest them how many different ways.
So we got them explain it.

616
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:20.660
You talk to your fucking Dick to put in their ass.
You got the point.
Um,

617
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.130
<v 2>okay,</v>

618
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.130
<v 1>good lord to those.
I have offended to those you're raped.</v>

619
00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.120
You're a fucking rapist.
And like,

620
00:37:28.121 --> 00:37:31.880
like how like he tries to tie in the fact that he's a priest

621
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.600
like below the standards expected of me as a priest,
Archbishop,

622
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.850
archbishop and Cardinal.

623
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.013
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

624
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.570
<v 1>So like
what if you,</v>

625
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:50.950
if you were a pope that was okay or was it because you never became a pope?

626
00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.750
So these guys basically been dental and kids ever since he got into that fucking

627
00:37:55.751 --> 00:38:00.610
hurt.
How is that thing still in business is just fucking beyond me.
Um,

628
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.060
anyways,
so that's the news for this week.
Everybody.
I hope you enjoyed it.
Um,

629
00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:08.890
let's get on with some sort of a,
uh,
what do we got here?

630
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:12.320
Did I talk about everything I want to talk about?
Yeah,
I think I did.
Alright,

631
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.170
cool.
Alright,
new girl.
Hey Bill.

632
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.570
Love your calamity and just wanted to ask a clarifying question.

633
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:24.880
My guy always gives me crap for watching the show new girl.
Uh,

634
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:28.450
due to the fact that he thinks the show is ridiculous.

635
00:38:28.451 --> 00:38:32.290
He refuses to believe that you did a spot on it.

636
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.610
Can you please verify whether or not you on a show is Nick's cousin?

637
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.410
I know you're a busy guy,

638
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:42.550
but I listened to your podcast and know that you respond personally to emails,

639
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.920
which is great.
Um,

640
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.700
I can neither confirm nor deny that that is top secret information.

641
00:38:49.701 --> 00:38:54.680
And I'm not allowed to talk about it.
Um,
but chances are good.

642
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.500
Yeah.
I did an episode of the,
I did an episode of it,
uh,
two weeks ago.

643
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:03.110
MMM.
Does that help you win your argument?

644
00:39:03.111 --> 00:39:07.490
Will that make your boyfriend like the show more?
I doubt it.
Uh,

645
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.160
he thinks to show is ridiculous,

646
00:39:10.161 --> 00:39:12.980
so he refuses to believe that I did a spot on it.
Well,
tell him this.

647
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.670
I did a spot on it and everybody in the show was fucking hilarious and I had a

648
00:39:16.671 --> 00:39:17.301
great time.

649
00:39:17.301 --> 00:39:22.220
And I also got to work with Nick Kroll who had me dying laughing between every

650
00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:25.190
take.
I was laughing like a school girl,
so I had a great time on the shelf.

651
00:39:25.191 --> 00:39:28.040
It's unfortunate your boyfriend can't enjoy the show,
but do you know what,

652
00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:32.600
that's why there's other shelves.
Um,
but I actually liked how your,

653
00:39:32.601 --> 00:39:37.430
your boyfriend views make that I am big enough to actually turn down acting
work,

654
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:42.350
having one day sit down and read my IMD be page and eight seconds later when

655
00:39:42.351 --> 00:39:43.184
he's finished,

656
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.070
I would do a pilot of a show that was ripping off sesame street.

657
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.330
And I would play the lower half of big bird at this point.
I don't give a fuck.

658
00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.780
Um,
so if I get to be on a hit show like that,
yeah,
absolutely.
Oh,

659
00:40:00.781 --> 00:40:04.390
I had a great time.
I had a great time on that show.
And uh,
you know,

660
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.380
just tell you boyfriend,
he doesn't have to watch it.
All right.
Hey Bill,

661
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.330
I'll keep this short,
but my wife had three years cheated on me back in July.
Oh,

662
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.510
Jesus.
While she did it three years in,
please don't have any kids.

663
00:40:16.511 --> 00:40:18.070
Please don't have any kids.
Please don't have any kids.

664
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.920
After telling her that I wanted to work things out,

665
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.340
she fucking left me for another dude in November.

666
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.360
Not even the dude she cheated on me with.
Um,
man.
Yeah,

667
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:32.440
that's one of those deals where you still loved her and she just fucking hit you

668
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:36.890
with a giant bucket of water and you were in shock.
Um,

669
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:42.090
so you tried to work it out with that cheating whore.
Uh,
anyways,
he said,
uh,

670
00:40:42.091 --> 00:40:47.070
I was friends with this girl since high school,
as was her.

671
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.860
Wait a minute.

672
00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.860
I was friends with this girl since high school as was with her now and was with

673
00:40:54.261 --> 00:40:58.330
her.
You wrote as Anne was with her for a total of six years and she broke,

674
00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.790
broke off our marriage via text.

675
00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

676
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:07.090
<v 1>What a fucking cunt.
Anyways,
I'm 30 years old in great shape,</v>

677
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.050
live on my own,

678
00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:12.070
have been on a dating website for a couple of months and I've yet to go out on a

679
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:16.630
date with anyone because I secretly think all these girls just like getting guys

680
00:41:16.631 --> 00:41:20.710
to look at their online profiles but never want to go out on a date.

681
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:25.390
My question is should I continue to try and find someone through online dating

682
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:26.320
or somewhere else?

683
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.220
I've only been with two girls my entire life and want to take your advice and

684
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:34.810
get it out of my system for a bit before I settled down with someone else.
Yeah,

685
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:38.150
do it.
Why don't you,
first of all,
you're only 30 years old,

686
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.800
which is really young nowadays.

687
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.760
Why don't you give yourself a little bit of time to heal from what the hell you

688
00:41:43.761 --> 00:41:47.210
just went through before you jump into something else.

689
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.340
Learn a little bit about yourself,

690
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:53.030
figure out what you're looking for and what you,
what you want.

691
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.780
What's a deal breaker,
what is something that you want,
you know,

692
00:41:56.781 --> 00:42:00.350
you're looking for.
And then I would go into a relationship like that.
Um,

693
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.960
I online dating I think is great.
I mean,
if I was a young guy,

694
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:07.940
I would do that in a second.
I mean,
that's just like,

695
00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:11.810
all of a sudden you become like the bill Bellacheck a pussy,
you know,

696
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.670
it's like you got your own draft.

697
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.390
It's like,
it's like you're looking at the,
the fucking,
the NFL combine,

698
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.990
you know,
but instead of seeing their vertical leap,
you'll,

699
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.900
you're looking at like a,
the teddies,
I don't know what you do and the thing,

700
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.590
but um,
look,
it could have been a lot worse.

701
00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.180
She could've done it like when you were 40 and you already had a couple of kids

702
00:42:35.181 --> 00:42:38.630
and you'd have to pay for a cheat and asked to,
um,

703
00:42:38.631 --> 00:42:41.060
I think the fact that you guys were young when you got married,

704
00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.040
I don't think she knows how to break up with somebody.

705
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:45.350
She probably deliberately sabotage the relationship.

706
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:48.890
And the fact that she sent a text,
she doesn't like confrontation.

707
00:42:48.891 --> 00:42:53.270
She still very immature.
Um,
so what are you going to do?

708
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.850
But whatever she's in the rear view mirror,
I would,

709
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.830
<v 2>okay.</v>

710
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.330
<v 1>You know,
the best revenge is living a great life.
So take some time.</v>

711
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:07.180
Go travel,
go fucking,
I don't know.
I'll do something for now to fly a helicopter,

712
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:11.840
ride a motorcycle,
go to Europe,
you know,
go,
go to a Superbowl,

713
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.720
both some cash,
just to something for yourself,

714
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.690
figuring out what you want to do and uh,

715
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.960
just tell women you're not ready to get into something until you are.
That's it.

716
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:23.690
And be totally 100% honest.
I'm going to call me back.

717
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:25.910
I thought he had a good time.
I had a great time,

718
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:30.110
but I didn't feel that feeling like you were the one.
I'm sorry.
You know,
Bang,

719
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:35.060
Bang,
boom real fucking quick.
And uh,
you know,
the second year,
honest like that,

720
00:43:35.061 --> 00:43:38.060
that's when you'll eventually find the person you're supposed to be with when

721
00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:40.370
you keep lying to people.
Cause you don't want to hurt their feelings.

722
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:45.080
You just end up hurting yourself.
So sorry you went through that.
Um,
but uh,

723
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:48.050
you know what dude,
it's your,
it's your time right now.
So enjoy yourself.

724
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.950
All right.
Doris,

725
00:43:50.951 --> 00:43:55.600
Bill ex-girlfriend won't x.
What does that mean?
Won't exit.
Uh,

726
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.930
I need some advice on how to handle a crazed woman.
Oh,
Jesus.

727
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:03.920
I Dunno dude.
This is rough.
A crazed woman.
Uh,

728
00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:08.090
I'm 18 and have joined the marine corps and I leave for basic and a few months.

729
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.010
While Jesus is a great out

730
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.300
as a way to get out of a relationship,
you know,
I'd love to keep seeing you,

731
00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:19.350
but I uh,
I joined the marines.
Yeah,
sorry about that.

732
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.620
I know.
It's crazy.
All right.
See you.
Anyways,
he said,

733
00:44:23.621 --> 00:44:25.680
I've been dating this girl for about six months in,

734
00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:29.370
dumped her because I feel like the last thing I need when I'm away is a

735
00:44:29.371 --> 00:44:31.830
relationship with someone who will never see

736
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.053
<v 4>exactly.</v>

737
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.900
The girl has constantly been blowing up my phone for the past couple of weeks.

738
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:41.130
Uh,
I thought she would calm down over time,
but it seems to be getting worse.

739
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.300
I started to get really concerned when I arrived home the other day and she was

740
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:47.190
at my house talking to my mother,

741
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.460
who thinks this girl is the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

742
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.770
How can I get this girl

743
00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.030
<v 1>out of my life?
Any advice?
Uh,
would be greatly appreciated.</v>

744
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:58.720
Love the podcasts.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

745
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:02.910
all right,
well what this is,
I,
you get a ride.
He's like,

746
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:06.660
if you just don't answer any of our calls,
all right.

747
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.830
And you know,
she shows up where you're at.
Just say,
leave me alone.

748
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.010
I don't want to talk.
And just,
you know,
eventually,
I mean,

749
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.210
you can't get blood from a stone.

750
00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.330
And I would immediately talk to me your mother and just say,
listen,

751
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.120
I know you love this girl,
but,
uh,
I don't just,

752
00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:24.870
this is going to be the mother of my kids and she's stalking me.

753
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.540
Okay?
So I need you to not talk to her.
And then that's it.

754
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:34.260
Start with that.
And then after that,
um,

755
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.840
I don't know where you go after that stun gun.
I don't know.

756
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.700
Did you go to the Marines?
So it's so it's going to be fucking over.

757
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.750
When did you say leaf?
A basic and a few months.
Yes.

758
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:47.160
Tell your mother to stop talking to her.

759
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:52.680
She say she's fucking nuts and uh,
yeah,

760
00:45:52.681 --> 00:45:56.250
that shouldn't be that hard.
I mean she,
she's just blowing up your phone.

761
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.463
You know,

762
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:01.710
she's not pinging in the batter of the brownies that you then eat with your

763
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:03.600
fucking best friend.
Right.
Like last week.

764
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.320
<v 4>Um,
anyways,
new pope a Boston.
Billy loved the podcast.</v>

765
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:11.730
Keep up the good work.
Thank you.

766
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.950
What do you make of all this news about the pope retiring?
Oh Geez.
Geez.

767
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.010
Personally I'm not that religious and don't really care that much.

768
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.340
Maybe if they elected a new pope that was young.
Well that was a young,

769
00:46:23.341 --> 00:46:27.210
some young hot lady in her twenties.
I would give a shit.

770
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.880
What do you think bill?
Is there more to the story that,

771
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.970
that they're not telling us where his age and health issues.

772
00:46:32.971 --> 00:46:37.470
The only reason he retired is the church covering anything up.
Um,

773
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.250
I'll come on and do what do they cover?
Anything up.
They,

774
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.110
they fucking have been an aisle.

775
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.240
Certain percentage of them have been covering up other fucking kids

776
00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:49.970
<v 1>for a long time.</v>

777
00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.830
<v 4>You know,
during World War Two there was a,
you know,</v>

778
00:46:53.831 --> 00:46:56.560
they got in bed with the Nazis.
I mean,

779
00:46:56.561 --> 00:47:00.460
it really is one of the worst organization as far as some of the shit that

780
00:47:00.461 --> 00:47:03.110
they've done,
you know,

781
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:08.090
but people are so wrapped into not pissing off the invisible guy and wanting to

782
00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:11.600
go to the happy place and get to eat marshmallows for the rest of you fall

783
00:47:11.601 --> 00:47:16.250
fucking eternity.
That they are actually,
it's really,
it's,

784
00:47:16.251 --> 00:47:17.390
it's disturbing.

785
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:18.950
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

786
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.020
<v 4>That people can still be part of that religion.</v>

787
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.100
<v 1>You don't want him,
I don't understand how,
you know,
the stuff that they've done.</v>

788
00:47:26.101 --> 00:47:30.910
So,
uh,
yeah,
I would say,
yeah,
there's probably something going on.
I don't know,

789
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:34.210
maybe he said something like a,
Hey,
you know,
ah,

790
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.640
maybe we should apologize for,
uh,

791
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:39.520
having that clam bake with Adolf Hitler.

792
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.500
Should we maybe clear the air with that one?
Hey,
what do you say?

793
00:47:44.501 --> 00:47:45.570
Yo,

794
00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:50.580
we actually don't help to pay for the lawyers of the people in our organization

795
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:55.270
who put their dicks in the acids of kids.
You know?

796
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:59.400
Maybe he said something like that.
I have no idea.
Anyways,
she said also,

797
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.500
what are some of some of the ways that they could make the church more

798
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:05.120
interesting?
For example,
maybe let broads,
but

799
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:09.220
I bet more people would pay attention.

800
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:13.060
Or how about letting people sit in lazy boys instead of sitting and kneeling and

801
00:48:13.061 --> 00:48:17.230
those terrible rock hard benches they call pews.
I know.
It's so dumb.

802
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:21.640
The whole thing is to get you like you're not worthy.
You're not worthy.

803
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:25.990
You're not worthy.
Get on your fucking knees and it's in.
It's all,

804
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:32.010
it's all made up by human beings taking a guest and other adults because they

805
00:48:33.251 --> 00:48:36.400
get into it.
His kids,
they,
they,
I don't know why.

806
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:41.320
I actually know why because I believe that there was like a spirituality and I

807
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:43.360
believe that you feel good when you do good things.

808
00:48:43.361 --> 00:48:48.361
And I just think that you can't corral that nobody owns it and you can't put a

809
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:49.390
fucking,
like,

810
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.580
I think that all churches should just be philosophies rather than this,

811
00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:58.270
this hardened way of looking at things.
Um,

812
00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.790
just the amount of death that it has caused.
I don't,

813
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:05.200
I'm not saying anything fucking,
do you guys know how I feel on this shit?
Um,

814
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.400
finally,
how about we live in up the music a bit and add some newer sounds.

815
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:11.320
Maybe a little guitar and drums.
Well,

816
00:49:11.321 --> 00:49:13.390
what you need to do is go to a Baptist church,

817
00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:18.610
go to a church where you don't see any white people going in there.
Um,
that,

818
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:21.610
that would be a good one to start with.
And I bet you're amazing.
You'll,

819
00:49:21.611 --> 00:49:24.970
you'll hear people who are actually in those churches probably sing bay better

820
00:49:24.971 --> 00:49:27.640
than half the people who won grammys that year.
I mean,

821
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:31.300
how many times you've seen some amazing created whore sticking her finger in a

822
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.180
year.
La Trying to act like they know how to sing and what do they,

823
00:49:34.181 --> 00:49:35.950
what's behind them all the fucking time.

824
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.600
It's always like fucking three black chicks or two black chicks is some black

825
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:43.330
dude.
I mean that's where the music is.
That's where it's coming from us.

826
00:49:43.331 --> 00:49:47.650
That's what you want.
Just fucking go there.
They're not going to give a shit.

827
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.480
Right.
They might look at you weird,
but after a while,

828
00:49:49.481 --> 00:49:52.540
once to see you feel the music,
you should be fine.
You should be fine.

829
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.010
The rest of the shit,
I don't know.

830
00:49:54.011 --> 00:49:56.980
I think that they should maybe update the stories.

831
00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:58.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

832
00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:02.490
<v 1>Every once in awhile
maybe,
uh,</v>

833
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.480
just make up some new shit.
Just say,
Oh,
you know what,
God,

834
00:50:06.481 --> 00:50:11.130
God came back again and the burning Bush said,
uh,
you know,

835
00:50:11.131 --> 00:50:15.930
let he who never,
uh,
illegally downloaded the song.

836
00:50:15.931 --> 00:50:18.090
Just something to fucking update it.
I don't know what to tell you.

837
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:19.763
You know what I mean?

838
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:21.763
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

839
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:26.170
<v 1>Updated,
I guess,
you know,
there are some sort of,
some of those new age,</v>

840
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.100
the new age ones

841
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.400
<v 4>are just as scary because then somehow somebody always ends up saying there,</v>

842
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:32.600
Jesus,
and the next thing you know,

843
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:36.320
you're surrounded by the FBI and his tank shooting flames at Ya.

844
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:39.890
Or you're waiting for some aliens to come.
And next thing you know,

845
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:44.450
everybody's drinking some poison and you're dying of fucking bunk bed,
you know?

846
00:50:44.451 --> 00:50:49.451
Or in the middle of the jungle with some sweaty fucking Conga player,

847
00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.170
whatever the fucking that guy's name was.

848
00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:52.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

849
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.900
<v 1>You know,
I think you better.
It's when it comes to us,</v>

850
00:50:55.901 --> 00:50:58.940
spirituality and that type of shit,
I think you're really,

851
00:50:58.941 --> 00:51:02.580
you're better off on your own.
MMM.

852
00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:08.190
I think,
you know,
I think generally speaking,
if you're not a psycho,

853
00:51:08.191 --> 00:51:10.230
you kind of know how to be a decent human being.

854
00:51:10.231 --> 00:51:15.210
I'm not saying that you're always succeed in it.
I certainly don't.
But,

855
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:19.760
um,
how the fuck do I put it?

856
00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:24.640
I would rather sit at a bar about six,

857
00:51:24.641 --> 00:51:29.641
seven beers in and talk to somebody else who's in the same mind frame and talk

858
00:51:29.801 --> 00:51:34.801
about life than I would to actually go to a church and listen to some guy up

859
00:51:35.111 --> 00:51:39.580
there going,
eh.
Then he did stop day Gaddy,
did something,

860
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.690
Aus,
he did it for you.
He died painfully.

861
00:51:43.691 --> 00:51:45.730
I hope you appreciated.

862
00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.970
And then I lay low ya'll ya'll way we are.

863
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.350
You're not fucking worthy.
We want you to remember this.

864
00:51:54.351 --> 00:51:56.630
Your a piece of shit.

865
00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:01.520
You better hope he's not mad at you.
I lay Lou.

866
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:06.500
Yeah,
I'll lay Lou.
Yeah,
I mean who the fuck wants to sit there through that?

867
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:12.660
I mean there's still telling stories about lepers.
Can we fucking update it?

868
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:15.443
<v 0>You know</v>

869
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:19.350
<v 1>the world was flat.</v>

870
00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:24.380
Now the world is flat and there was some lappers and a guy at a big Bodie stuck

871
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:31.280
some animals on,
what am I singing?

872
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:36.520
I don't even know.
I shouldn't have listened to my mother.

873
00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:40.570
Like how do you,
how do you end up in that?
Okay,
here's a job where you,

874
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.840
you're not going to be able to ever fuck another woman again.

875
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.743
<v 0>You know?</v>

876
00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:50.560
<v 1>Well,
do I get a wife?
No,
you don't get that.</v>

877
00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.800
You're going to sit in his dorm room with a bunch of other guys.

878
00:52:53.801 --> 00:52:57.850
None of you are beginners.
They're going to get any pussy whatsoever.

879
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.310
Okay?
There you go.
There's a natural,
like the whole thing is just like,

880
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:07.310
as far as the Catholic way is just like,
just flogging yourself.

881
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:11.810
Do you understand how fucked up,
but you got one fucking life.

882
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:16.070
You should be out having the time of your life,
you know,
not hurting anybody,

883
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:19.070
but having the time you life and enjoying it because you fucking deserve it

884
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:22.700
because you were lucky enough to be born a human being and not a fucking house

885
00:53:22.701 --> 00:53:23.534
fly.

886
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:27.900
What if reincarnation is all right and you're going to fucking come back?

887
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:31.460
Is is a,
uh,
I don't know.
Something.
A snake.
Each

888
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.700
one of those little fucking lizards sitting at darting around.

889
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.090
Any of you don't get eaten by a snake.
He only lived like 14 days.

890
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.830
You can fucking drive a car.
You know,

891
00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.900
you never see a lizard doin that shit.
Do.
Ah,
Jesus,

892
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:53.280
this is best as fucking with me.
Um,
hey,
everybody gets where I'm going this week.

893
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:55.860
I'm in beautiful downtown fucking Los Angeles,

894
00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.280
enjoying my life right now and this wonderful weather,
you know,

895
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:00.570
and you're probably thinking like,
hey bill,

896
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:03.150
last thing you want to do is go to Wisconsin and Michigan.

897
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:07.830
And you know what I say?
Fuck you.
That's exactly where I am going.

898
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:10.110
I'm going to Wisconsin,

899
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:13.650
the great state of Wisconsin and I am then going on to Michigan.

900
00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:16.980
I am doing a bunch of shows this weekend as you can tell by how long it's taken

901
00:54:16.981 --> 00:54:18.930
me to tell you this.
I'm opening my website.

902
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:23.040
I'm going to be at the Barrymore theater in Madison,

903
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:26.460
Wisconsin on March 7th,

904
00:54:26.461 --> 00:54:29.370

905
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:33.870

Wisconsin area.

906
00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.590
Um,

I will be knewing not one,

907
00:54:37.591 --> 00:54:41.250
but two shows at the legendary beautiful,

908
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.060
absolutely gorgeous PAPP's theater in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.

909
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:49.380
Um,
if you live in that area and you've never been to the theater,
you know,

910
00:54:49.381 --> 00:54:51.720
you should write,
you should come down,
see the show at the very least.

911
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:56.520
Just look at the,
uh,
the beautiful etchings on the wall.
On March 9th,

912
00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.190
I will be doing the,
uh,
Albeit Fountain Street church in Grand Rapids,

913
00:55:02.191 --> 00:55:05.490
Michigan,
part of the,
uh,
there's a comedy festival out there.

914
00:55:05.491 --> 00:55:07.080
I don't have the name of it on my,
uh,

915
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:11.310
website March 9th and March 10th.

916
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.400
I will be,
uh,

917
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:17.250
right outside of Detroit at the Royal Oak Music Theater for not one,

918
00:55:17.251 --> 00:55:21.030
but two shows on March 10th.
So that's it.

919
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.433
That's the deal.

920
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:26.490
I'm going to visit winter for four days and it's going to be a great time.

921
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:31.320
And if you guys know any,
uh,
any great places to eat out there,

922
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.900
places you know,
Shit that I should definitely get him.

923
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.200
You got to get yourself a horse shoe.
Have you had a juicy Lucy?

924
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:39.360
Whatever the fuck you have out there,
a sandwich,

925
00:55:39.361 --> 00:55:43.920
a drink of fucking buffalo wings,
whatever you got.
I want to know.
Um,

926
00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:48.720
all right.
That's it.
Where the hell are we?
55 minutes in.

927
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:53.010
I can't stop this early.
Oh,
okay.
Let me tell you this story here.

928
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:58.430
Uh,
last night I had a,
uh,
I did this great thing,
this,

929
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:02.550
this,
um,
the fuck is my phone.

930
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.530
I lose my phone already.
You guys like me.

931
00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:09.030
Do you lose your phone like fucking 20 times a God Damn Day?

932
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:15.450
What's the deal with Lulu Moon?
Um,
what am I trying to say?

933
00:56:15.451 --> 00:56:18.780
Okay.
Last night,
ah,
this is fucking goddamn thing enough already.

934
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.260
Last night I did a skyway comedian.
Wayne Fetterman does this great

935
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.870
<v 4>film festival every year and he picks like four or five comedians and they all</v>

936
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:34.140
basically talk about of a film that influenced them as a comedian or just

937
00:56:34.301 --> 00:56:37.750
wanting to get into show business.
So whatever.
And uh,

938
00:56:37.751 --> 00:56:41.600
they have the comic talk about it before and then they show the movie.
And um,

939
00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.310
the night I was down there,
nick

940
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.900
<v 1>crawl went down and he did raising Arizona.</v>

941
00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.590
I'm sitting out in a crowd and the movie's just fucking killing and I'm laughing

942
00:56:51.591 --> 00:56:55.660
and having a great time wherever I go down the street.
And,
uh,
I picked the,

943
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.720
I picked the dirty dozen,
you know,
I loved that movie.

944
00:56:59.721 --> 00:57:03.440
All of a Victor Franco.
I just,
I just loved that,

945
00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:06.630
that the attitudes at the dirty dozen guys had where they just kind of,

946
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:09.720
I don't appeal to me as a kid.
Like they did,
they,

947
00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:14.970
they were fighting it like a,
they had issues with authority.
You know,

948
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.240
I didn't like teachers.
I didn't like my parents going,
hey,
get in there,

949
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:20.310
clean up your fucking room.
I just never liked it.

950
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:25.530
So the movie appealed to me and what I didn't realize is that movie is 150

951
00:57:25.531 --> 00:57:28.860
minutes long.
So if anybody,

952
00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.790
only five people walked out.
We started the fucking movie.

953
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:38.370
I don't know when we started with the show was supposed to start at 10,
15.

954
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:41.640
I know it may,
it had to have started a little bit late.
We did do a Q and.
A,

955
00:57:41.641 --> 00:57:46.560
which was a lot of fun and I don't know when the movie started,

956
00:57:46.561 --> 00:57:47.394
but it,
it,

957
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.520
it ended at like 10 past one in the morning and I was sitting in the back and I

958
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:57.240
literally felt like it was my movie and it was bombing people still enjoyed it

959
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.670
because it was,
you know,
movie festival.

960
00:57:59.671 --> 00:58:01.350
It's like movie geeks and that type of thing.

961
00:58:01.351 --> 00:58:06.351
But my apologies to anybody there who wanted to leave but didn't want to be rude

962
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.230
because I was sitting there in the back just for to be empathetic.

963
00:58:10.231 --> 00:58:12.630
My ass fell asleep to,
I can't pull,

964
00:58:12.631 --> 00:58:17.340
I never remember it being that fucking long.
The middle of that movie,

965
00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:19.680
the whole thing where they have the war games.
I mean,

966
00:58:19.681 --> 00:58:23.520
I think they shot that in real time.
They could have done that so much quicker.

967
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:25.343
<v 0>MMM.</v>

968
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.780
<v 4>Hundred and 50 I what is that?
Two hours</v>

969
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.380
<v 1>30 that's two and a half hours long.</v>

970
00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:34.850
<v 0>MMM [inaudible]</v>

971
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:37.280
<v 4>but anyways,
I,
I,
you know,</v>

972
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:40.520
I kept wanting to leave out of embarrassment because I just kept feeling like

973
00:58:40.521 --> 00:58:43.730
everyone was getting tired and they weren't enjoying it.

974
00:58:43.731 --> 00:58:47.660
But I was also going like,
wait,
I get to see the dirty dozen on a big screen.
So,

975
00:58:47.661 --> 00:58:51.650
uh,
but Wayne assured me that everybody had a great time and they loved the movie

976
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.710
and

977
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:53.543
<v 0>uh,</v>

978
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:57.710
<v 4>I dunno,
it was a,
it was definitely a fun time.
So if you're ever out here in la,</v>

979
00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:58.970
this time of year,
I guess every year,

980
00:58:58.971 --> 00:59:02.840
Wayne Fetterman does it at the silent movie theater on Fairfax Avenue when I

981
00:59:02.841 --> 00:59:07.460
think that's about it.
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is the podcast for this week.

982
00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.020
Uh,
like I said,

983
00:59:09.021 --> 00:59:12.320
I'll be at Wisconsin and I'll be in Michigan if you guys know of any places to

984
00:59:12.321 --> 00:59:15.110
eat out that way that I should check out.
Uh,

985
00:59:15.111 --> 00:59:17.000
I try to stay out of trouble when I'm on the road,

986
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:21.980
but if there is a great bar that you know of,
maybe a check one out,

987
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.250
<v 1>like grand rapids,
what does it do in grand rapids?</v>

988
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.130
I don't know that I've been out to that one.
Whatever.

989
00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:31.550
You guys will figure it out.
That's the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

990
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.780
Oh lastly,
last thing I have here,
sorry,

991
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:39.260
the USP Bestos is kicking in.
I finally have the hard copy.

992
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:41.630
I'm literally making the shape of the DVD,

993
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:45.650
like one of the corners with my hand for some reason in front of my face so I

994
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:49.500
can find the word in my speced this logged head.
Um,

995
00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:53.930
I finally had the hard copy versions of uh,
my,

996
00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:58.090
my special that came out last year.
You people are all the same.
Um,

997
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:01.320
I'll be selling those in uh,

998
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:06.400
Wisconsin and in Michigan already signed all of them and ship them out through

999
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:11.320
stamps.com and a every show after this I will be selling those motherfuckers

1000
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:15.980
cause I've got about 200 boxes of him sitting in my garage,
taken up space.
So,

1001
01:00:15.981 --> 01:00:19.220
uh,
if you want to buy the hard copy version of it,

1002
01:00:19.221 --> 01:00:23.330
come out to my show and eventually we're going to get them up hopefully sooner

1003
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:26.420
rather than later on the website.
And um,

1004
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:29.240
I really appreciate it if you buy one and if you don't,

1005
01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:30.680
if you've already downloaded one,
whatever.

1006
01:00:30.681 --> 01:00:33.020
Thanks for listening and all that shit.
All right,
go fuck yourselves.

1007
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:33.860
We'll talk to you next week.
