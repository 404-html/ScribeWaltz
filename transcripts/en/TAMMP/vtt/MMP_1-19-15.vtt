00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
Okay.

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.530
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?</v>

3
00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:08.531
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.590
Monday.
Um,
what is today?
It's January 19th.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.660
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm actually taping this on Sunday.

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.863
<v 2>First</v>

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.510
<v 1>much in the Patriots right now.
The are up 14 to seven,</v>

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.800
four minutes to go into fucking foot.
Second quarter.
Joe.

9
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.870
Joe,
what are you,
what are you supposed to be fucking Paul Murphy.

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.550
You fucking goddamn colonial hat.
Um,

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.550
alright.
I've gotta be honest with you guys.

12
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:45.080
I already recorded a podcast this week with a very special guest.
Uh,
but it's,

13
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.990
it's a famous drummer and a,

14
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.991
I think it's going to be too much of a drum head thing for a while.

15
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:55.910
You guys had just like,
are you still listening to me talk about sports?

16
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:59.030
So I'm going to do a quick one here Monday and then I'm going to have,
uh,

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.990
I have an interview with Chris Leighton from a Stevie Ray Vaughan and double

18
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:10.910
trouble back in the day from arch angels.
I saw him touring last year,

19
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:14.570
came through the Greek with Kenny Wayne Shepherd.
Um,

20
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:18.200
he does that Hendricks review thing and he's actually in town here in la working

21
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.610
with Stephen Stills.
So,
uh,
if you're into drums and uh,
you know,
it's not,

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.870
not the only thing that we talk about,
but we talk about,
uh,
his time,
you know,

23
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:30.350
coming up and making it and push it through people being negative little talk

24
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:32.510
about whiplash in there.
Uh,

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.720
I think it's a really interesting podcast even if you don't play drums.
And uh,

26
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.040
he got me some hilarious,

27
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.390
a couple of hilarious gifs and then one unbelievable one cause he's such a great

28
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:44.570
guy.
So please tune in.
I'll post that probably on Wednesday of this week.

29
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.020
So let's talk,
start talking some

30
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.860
<v 3>dad.
Dad,</v>

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.650
<v 1>make me a fucking sandwich lady,
lady please.</v>

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.633
Kitchen.

33
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.270
You know the houses are so close together out here.
I shouldn't be yelling.

34
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.930
Stuff like that.
You know,
I shouldn't.
Yeah,
yeah,
look at me again.

35
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:16.070
I'll give you another one.

36
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.700
Let's see if I can get the cops coming to my house.
Um,

37
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.660
I shouldn't do that.
Like Garrett blank referenced Gab.
Sorry,

38
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:29.840
I'm not going to do that.
But I do have the game on here and I actually have to,

39
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:33.800
uh,
I don't know.
I got a ton of Shit I got to do tomorrow.
So anyways.

40
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.210
<v 0>Okay,</v>

41
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.000
<v 1>what do we do here?
What do we do?
Um,
I gotta tell you something right now.</v>

42
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.560
I was what?
I watched the Green Seattle game and I am over it,

43
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.540
but I was absolutely fucking sick at the end of that game.

44
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.630
I'm not out of like a hate and Seattle kind of thing.

45
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.860
It was just that fucking prevent defense,

46
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.680
prevent or fencing.
I just,
for the life of me,

47
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.100
I mean it to work,

48
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.430
<v 4>it has to,
it has to work.
Not only has,
does it have to work,</v>

49
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.580
it has to work way more times than it doesn't work for them to continue the

50
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:16.551
insanity of playing football for 50 fucking minutes,

51
00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:20.700
55 minutes.
And then in the end you just play,
not to lose that.

52
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.130
I Greenbay went into

53
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.280
<v 1>Seattle.
They shut up the crowd.</v>

54
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.730
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

55
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.990
<v 4>they,
they handled,
they manhandled him through the first half.</v>

56
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.670
And then when you know Seattle was going to come back and have a surge and they

57
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:37.690
handled that

58
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.260
<v 1>five minutes to go,</v>

59
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.610
they pick off Russell Wilson for the fourth fucking time.

60
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.760
You got the ball back.
All right,
let's fucking eat up some clock.

61
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.480
<v 4>What?
What do they do?</v>

62
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.620
They run the ball into the ass or this center three fucking times and then punt

63
00:03:57.621 --> 00:03:58.454
it.

64
00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.040
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.180
<v 4>The,
I don't even think they took a minute off the clock.</v>

66
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.260
<v 5>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.810
<v 4>The whole game.
And you've got Aaron Rodgers is a quarterback.</v>

68
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.570
Does he all of a sudden not know how to throw a fucking ball?

69
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.170
It's guys a super bowl champion.
Do you think he's fucking nervous?

70
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.410
The whole game you're playing to win and then in the end you've,
I,

71
00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:17.090
it was fucking unbelievable.

72
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:19.580
I can't imagine what it'd be like the plane for the fucking packers.

73
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.160
Aaron Rodgers taking those play calls.

74
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.170
<v 5>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.003
<v 1>You know?</v>

76
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.930
<v 5>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.130
<v 4>All right,
man.
Five minutes ago,
what are we doing now?</v>

78
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.040
What are you gonna dump it off to run it back.
We're going to post pattern.

79
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:30.874
What are we doing here?

80
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.630
<v 1>Rod?
The ball up the battle.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah,
I get it.</v>

81
00:04:35.631 --> 00:04:36.500
Burnt a little clock here,

82
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.373
<v 2>right?</v>

83
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.750
<v 1>Timeout.
Two seconds.
Three seconds off the clock.</v>

84
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.080
All right,
coach.
Second down and 10 what are we doing?

85
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:51.000
How are we throwing the ball here,
right?
What are we gonna do?

86
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:54.540
A little play action.
Fake freeze.
The linebackers do.
Some here may pick up five,

87
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:57.360
six yards.
It up.
Blood battle.

88
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.760
<v 5>Okay.</v>

89
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.420
<v 2>Rarely.
Hi.
Hey the boss,
right?</v>

90
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.500
<v 1>Oh,
tackle.
Timeout.</v>

91
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.840
Now the two seconds off to fucking clock.
Third down at 10

92
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.080
<v 5>okay.</v>

93
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.250
<v 4>Battery.
Is it fucking Aaron's warming up his arm.
What are we doing here?
Come on.</v>

94
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.430
Who am I throwing it to?
Run it up.
The battle.

95
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.490
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

96
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.630
<v 1>he fucking serious.</v>

97
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.150
<v 5>Okay.</v>

98
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.360
<v 1>The fuck are we doing right?</v>

99
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.040
You don't want to throw the ball it into the ass crack of your center.

100
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.550
This is a recording.

101
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.830
<v 2>Boom.
54</v>

102
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.240
<v 1>over Seattle doesn't take a timeout.
Greenbay kicks the ball away.</v>

103
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.280
They take off fucking 50 seconds.
55 seconds off the clock.
Then what do they do?

104
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.990
Are they going to go back to play in football and get up in

105
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.823
<v 4>their grills?</v>

106
00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.880
<v 5>Okay.</v>

107
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.090
<v 4>Rush fucking Russell Wilson put them on his back like they have been the whole</v>

108
00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:06.630
gap.
Fuck that.
I got a better idea.

109
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.670
Let's go into the prevent.

110
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.750
<v 5>Okay,</v>

111
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.430
<v 4>let's go into the fucking prevent defense,
which is basically we don't want to,</v>

112
00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:17.710
we don't want them to score on one big play.

113
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.230
<v 5>Okay?</v>

114
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.230
<v 4>We'll protect the sidelines will give them the middle in 15 to 20 yard chunks</v>

115
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.400
while they burn the clock or burn that time outs.
That's the philosophy.

116
00:06:29.401 --> 00:06:31.710
So basically you don't give it up on one play.

117
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.790
You give it up on sixth place and you make every quarterback,

118
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.710
every quarterback who's ever faced a prevent defense immediately looked how Joe

119
00:06:40.711 --> 00:06:43.150
Montana or John Elway,
oh,

120
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.650
Roger's star back used to look when and in the final two minutes of the game

121
00:06:46.651 --> 00:06:51.210
when they actually played fucking defense as far as I remember.

122
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.750
So Seattle goes,
right.
You know,
you know what the F and I am literally,

123
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.010
where's my phone?
I fucking was texting Paul Versey.

124
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.420
You want to hear my tweets during the end of this fucking game?
All right,

125
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:06.430
here we go.
Let me scroll.

126
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.320
Jesus said coming in chunks coming in chunks.
Let's see here.

127
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.551
All right.
This is me.

128
00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:15.910
After I watched him run the ball into the ass of their fucking center.

129
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:18.760
Three plays in a row and then punted all capitals.

130
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:23.290
What a fucking waste of a possession.
They are now going to ruin it.
Oh,

131
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:26.380
now that they're all that,
I think they still had one more run to go.

132
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:27.670
They are now going to run it.

133
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.520
<v 5>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.200
<v 4>They just got,</v>

135
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.990
Seattle is just going to take a timeout fucking eight seconds off the clock.

136
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.650
Now they've kicked the ball.
I right.
What was the strategy there?

137
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.070
Get the other team to use all the time outs.

138
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.790
They aren't even going to burn a minute off the clock on for fucking place.

139
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.950
Paul writes back,
I know now Seattle has the ball and I text.

140
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.640
They're literally going to get,

141
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.930
you're going to give this team a touchdown just so they can burn off time from

142
00:07:54.931 --> 00:07:55.764
the clock.

143
00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.860
I can't tell if that is good coaching or it is done by the league to give every

144
00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:04.710
game possible.
A dramatic ending.
This is when I'm sitting there going,

145
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:08.520
I'm a comedian.
What the fuck do I know about,

146
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.370
about prevent the fits?
All I know is a fan watching.
Now obviously they scored.

147
00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:15.990
I wrote fucking joke.

148
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.250
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

149
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.400
<v 4>verse.
He wrote wild and he said,
no TD.</v>

150
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:21.830
Thank God all that's when they throw it to Marshawn lynch.

151
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.820
Who by the way is the closest thing I've seen since Earl Campbell watching an

152
00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:28.010
entire defense tried to tackle that man is like,

153
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:31.610
you haven't been drunk with your friends during the summertime and all the

154
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:35.330
windows of your car was down and you got everybody gets out of the car on a

155
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.810
small hill and all of a sudden you notice the car starts rolling and everybody

156
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:42.530
grabs onto it sliding in their tennis shoes trying to stop it.
Eventually.

157
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:46.460
You fucking do.
That's what it's like watching a defense.
Trying stop.

158
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:49.290
Marshawn Lynch fucking amazing.
Um,

159
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.880
then I go every fucking game,
Paul.
Every fucking game.

160
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:57.250
That stupid strategy makes every team look like the 40 niners in 1989.

161
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.640
Um,
okay,
now Greenbay okay,
they now are you.

162
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.380
I want to read the whole this whole fucking thing.
It's just basically,

163
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:06.850
<v 5>okay,</v>

164
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:07.690
<v 4>I'll read the excerpts.</v>

165
00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:10.480
It's the dumbest fucking strategy I've ever seen in my life.

166
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.940
Green Bay packers deserve this.
They're fans don't.
Then in the end,

167
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:17.720
travesty in verse,
he said,

168
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.960
the problem was they kicked a gut feel goals instead of touchdowns.

169
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.170
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you're playing against the defense,

170
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.040
I feel is good is Seattle's.
You got to take what they're going to give you.

171
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.683
All right?

172
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.210
You kicked the field goals and then your defense was answering the call.

173
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.970
They answered the belt,
whatever the fucking cliche is,

174
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:39.840
and you had the fucking game.
One Green Bay had the ball back.

175
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:44.010
They had the ball,
they had their fucking destiny in their hands.

176
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.790
Go for a first down.
They,
if they got to first downs,
three first downs,

177
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:49.050
that fucking game is over.

178
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.230
<v 5>Okay.</v>

179
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.320
<v 4>All right.
Sorry,
I'm back.
I'm back.
I actually knocked my recorder off.</v>

180
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:59.430
I was saying I'm so fucking old that when I see people who run like me,

181
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.410
how bad I run.
They've played 17 years of quarterback and blew out an ACL.
Um,

182
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.010
anyway,
so I at the end of the game,
watching them,

183
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.620
watching them lose that game the way they did.

184
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.740
First of all,
congrats.
I didn't even say congratulation to Seattle.

185
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:21.060
Congratulations.
I mean,
it's not your fault.
They stop fucking playing.

186
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.000
And I guess to say that I'm taking away from your victory,

187
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:25.650
but I'm sure you've seen your team.

188
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.680
I think every football fan you've seen your team do that.

189
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.210
You've seen your team just playing football.
I'm not giving it up an inch.

190
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:38.600
I'm right up on you.
Fuck this.
We're winning this game.

191
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.250
And then you go to this whole like,
well,
you know,
I'll give you like [inaudible],

192
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.870
we'll give you a 10 yards,
15 yards.
But that's it.
I mean just,

193
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:49.370
it's just the exact,

194
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:50.870
<v 5>yeah.</v>

195
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.470
<v 4>I don't know if the mentality of it,
I just don't,
I don't understand it.</v>

196
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.730
It makes you know what it is about the prevent defense.
No game is out of reach.

197
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.460
You have to be like fucking up 21 points,
but if it's below 20

198
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.920
all of a sudden within five minutes if you're going to play that way,

199
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:13.470
it just seems like everything all of a sudden is in reach.

200
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.400
And then the de the announcers dramatical,
Tarnow Blah Blah.
Paula,

201
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.450
I who would never thought what when you start playing 20 yards off a guy,

202
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:28.080
when you stop calling any imagine of plays on offense and even Troy Aikman on

203
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:29.840
the third time was going like,
no,

204
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.490
I got a thrill like to go running in there and keep it on the ground.

205
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:33.810
It's like everybody knew it.

206
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.510
When you got to stand up comedians texting what the Green Bay packers are going

207
00:11:40.511 --> 00:11:41.081
to do next,

208
00:11:41.081 --> 00:11:44.920
that's probably not a good sign as far as if you're going to try and win a

209
00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:45.754
fucking game.

210
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.290
<v 5>Okay</v>

211
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.550
<v 4>Dude,
I was so,</v>

212
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.890
I was so upset because I felt the pay,
you know,

213
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.860
<v 1>I'm not looking past the colts either.
I know obviously anything can happen,</v>

214
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:58.440
but if we were going to go to the Superbowl,

215
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.500
I got to think that uh,

216
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.150
for whatever reason we matched up better with green bay.
I just,

217
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.100
I just feel that the fact that we get for the most part,

218
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:16.660
no pressure on the quarterback and you got Russell who so mobile,

219
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.340
um,

220
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.560
that would present a problem and then we suck against the run for the most part.

221
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.430
And Marshawn Lynch,
even if you're good against them,
it takes at least what,

222
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:30.730
like six,
seven people just to kind of slow him down.

223
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.670
And Seattle's defense is unbelievable.
As annoying as they are,

224
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:40.300
how they stand over every person after they tackle them as if that person has

225
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.560
never been tackled before.

226
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.030
And as annoying is all those bandwagon fans are,

227
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.640
which was hilarious to see them locked out.
You know,

228
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:52.240
nobody who was at the kingdom back in the day left that game,
you know,

229
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:54.730
Goddamn well they going to stay there.
Even if they were going to lose,

230
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.970
they would have sat there and they would have cried like a real fan and then

231
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:02.860
walked out to your car with your head down.
It was always next year.
Right.
Um,

232
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.760
I have a tremendous amount of respect for,
uh,
for that organization.

233
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:07.750
I mean it's the fucking,

234
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.800
I mean obviously the teams that they put together is incredible.
Um,

235
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.230
but I would like to win the Superbowl,

236
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.160
so I would like to give my team the greatest chance.
So I was,
uh,

237
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.590
that was not the damn team that I wanted to play,
but um,

238
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.750
it's not even that the Seattle one,

239
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:26.470
it was the way green bay loss and I had to get in my fucking Prius,

240
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.790
fucking go for a drive.
And um,

241
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.510
I ended up in an Italian restaurant.

242
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.810
They make homemade pasta.
Right.

243
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:43.110
And I was right before dinner and they hadn't made that.

244
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:46.110
They were in the process of making the pasta and the sauce.
So I got an a,

245
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.630
I got a salad and then just a couple of meatballs and sat there and had a scotch

246
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.480
as the patriots are playing,
recording the game.

247
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.723
<v 6>MMM.</v>

248
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.600
<v 1>Just dumbfounded how I watch green bay loose at fucking game.</v>

249
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.940
And uh,

250
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.680
and somewhere halfway through that scotch that I was drinking,

251
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:10.681
it just became hilarious that my team was playing and I was so distraught over

252
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:15.070
to other teams that aren't my team.
That didn't knock my team out,

253
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.980
that I wasn't even watching my team,
even though I was recording it.

254
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.270
And just that whole thing of like,
why the fuck?

255
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.110
Why do I care this much?
And I'm,

256
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.190
I don't know,
it just kind of struck me as funny.

257
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.130
Then of course I'm talking to the bartender and you know,

258
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:36.640
he doesn't give a shit about,
well,
I guess maybe he could give a shit.

259
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:39.670
He just needed money.
So he was working.
I just assume if you've taken that shift,

260
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.530
you could at least fake sick or whatever.

261
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.720
<v 6>Um,
so</v>

262
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.470
<v 1>anyways,
uh,</v>

263
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.890
Jesus Christ two in a row at least it wasn't a bad call man.

264
00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:59.810
But what the fuck?
What the fuck.
Anyways,

265
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:04.540
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Um,
I don't have any,
uh,

266
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.830
any questions or anything this week.
How far into this?

267
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:08.720
I don't even know how many fucking minutes of any of this cause I don't,

268
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.430
I didn't look at the first one should probably,
uh,

269
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.170
Micah Dolan's is not only to packer fans,

270
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:18.710
but any fan of a fucking team that had to sit there and watch your team have a

271
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:21.320
game one and then go into the prevent defense.
I,

272
00:15:21.321 --> 00:15:26.000
I'm really actually going to listen to sports talk radio tomorrow morning to try

273
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:30.530
and have some,
hopefully somebody will explain it.

274
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.550
Um,
there's another one,

275
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.870
I don't get five seconds left in the half for some fucking reason.

276
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.430
You squib kick it.
So then they get the ball in the 40.

277
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.780
Like how big a threat is that guy back in the end zone?
What are the odds?

278
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:51.950
He's going to take it to the 40
if they wanted to,

279
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:52.940
they probably won't,

280
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:56.570
but if they wanted to they could just fucking heave it to the end zone with

281
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:00.770
Andrew Lux arm.
Right.
I Dunno,
I don't fucking get it.

282
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.110
Um,
well,
Bill,
you're a comedian,
you're not supposed to get it.
Oh,

283
00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:07.760
go fuck yourself.
Um,
so anyways,
I got a,
uh,

284
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:12.560
I've got a crazy week coming up here.
Um,
you guys remembered a long time ago.

285
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:17.150
I did a movie out in New Orleans called black or white that started,
oh,

286
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:20.570
they took a knee.
It's nothing.
Why don't you throw the Hail Mary?

287
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.450
They used to do that.
What is the problem?
Um,
anyways,

288
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.010
I really sound like a crabby old man.

289
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:32.390
Why aren't they doing it the way that you start though?
It?
Uh,
all right.

290
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:36.800
So I did a movie a year and a half ago,
uh,
called black or white,

291
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.440
um,
starring Kevin Costner,
Octavia Spencer,

292
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.740
and I directed and written by Mike binder.
Um,
and uh,

293
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.310
it's finally coming out.
It's coming out on January 30th and a,

294
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:53.840
so we're doing all the promotion,

295
00:16:53.841 --> 00:16:56.990
all the press and all that type of stuff this week,
which should be a,

296
00:16:56.991 --> 00:17:01.970
hopefully a good time.
So I got a bunch of that type of shit coming up and uh,

297
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:07.220
I'm going to be on,
um,
real time with Bill Maher

298
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.080
on a,
on Friday.
And,
uh,

299
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.620
and then after that on Saturday,
I lead from my,
uh,

300
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:22.000
what the hell am I going?
I go to Australia,
New Zealand,
Singapore,

301
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.980
Hong Kong,
Mumbai,
all of that shit.

302
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.800
And I get back to just going back to being a comedian.

303
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:31.970
So I got basically a week of press here that I'm doing coming up.
Um,

304
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.550
I was in New Orleans this week.
I did an,
uh,

305
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.760
had a quick three day shoot and a,
an upcoming movie.

306
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:42.560
I never see what they are until they're coming out.

307
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.680
And then I make sure that I'm still in them.
So,
uh,
you know,

308
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.950
trying to keep my actor health insurance hanging in there,
the sag after shit.
So,

309
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.110
uh,
anyways,
let's do a little bit of advertising here for this week.

The fitness industry is booming.

337
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.820
Of course it is.

338
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.950

going to make money off of them.

And then the last one here,

359
00:21:05.551 --> 00:21:08.610
I'm going to read draft kings.com yeah,
season ending.

360
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.430
Long fantasy football league may be over,

361
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.000
but there's plenty of excitement.
Sorry you had a scotch,

362
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.920
but there's plenty of excitement every week at draft kings that can't turn
story.

363
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:24.780
Dave from Boston won $1 million and one day just playing fantasy football.

364
00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:28.740
So did Matt from Florida and Ray from New Jersey,

365
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:33.720
Ray aggy and fucking a million euro.
You're fed code.

366
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.670
In fact,
draft kings is crowned a new millionaire nearly every week.
This season.

367
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.650
The football action even continues throughout the playoffs@draftkings.com and be

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.180
You've been hearing about big witness at draftkings all year.

374
00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:08.970

Draft kings.com.
All right,
let's go back to this.

381
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.200
Um,
oh,
I did another one of the goddamn comedy jam,
uh,

382
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.360
this weekend with Josh Adam Meyers.
And,
uh,

383
00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:43.950
we actually did,
um,

384
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.870
I did a Pentair or song cowboys from health was the song that I chose to do

385
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.000
despite the fact that I don't play double bass.
And,
uh,

386
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.170
Mike Double Bass playing was,
was,
uh,
it was pretty horrific,

387
00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.580
but it was way better than I was before I decided to do that song.
Um,

388
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.410
I dressed up like Vinnie Paul.
I made an ass of myself and uh,

389
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.800
but it's fun.
You know,
it was cool was I sat down behind the kid,

390
00:23:07.801 --> 00:23:11.040
I wasn't nervous at all,
which is a,

391
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.690
which is a good thing because usually there's a,
um,
you know,

392
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.810
cause I'm stepping outside myself,
but you know,
you just keep doing it,
doing it,

393
00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:21.090
doing it then all of a sudden just becomes,
oh yeah,
I'm doing this show again.

394
00:23:21.091 --> 00:23:25.040
I've done it before.
I know what I got to do,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

395
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.000
And uh,
you know,
it's funny.
That sound was really bad.
We were outside in a tent.

396
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.200
It's way better when it's,

397
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.380
when they have the show over on the brave because you can actually,
you know,

398
00:23:34.381 --> 00:23:35.280
the sound was tremendous.

399
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:38.700
They had to turn down the sound because we were playing riot fest.

400
00:23:38.701 --> 00:23:41.490
It's some sort of comedy festival that they have in downtown La.

401
00:23:41.491 --> 00:23:44.970
And people were complaining about the noise,
not even from the music.

402
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.740
They were complaining about how loud the stand ups or I guess there was a

403
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.380
apartment building right next door.
So my apology to those people.

404
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:59.090
But um,
yeah,
went up there and I had a,
I had a good time.

405
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:04.091
So I have no idea what the next one I'm going to do is if you guys have any

406
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.240
requests,
you know,
I'm be,

407
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:11.510
I'm basically asking you guys to give me an idea of what song I should fucking

408
00:24:11.511 --> 00:24:14.960
play next because I'm kind of out of ideas.

409
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:19.580
I played a Zepplin one dress like John Bonham,
Motley Crue,
Tommy Lee,

410
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.910
and I did Pantera.
Um,

411
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.900
I dunno,
I don't know.
I don't know.
Let the double Bass Golf.

412
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.090
I don't want to do a novel now the double Bass Song,

413
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:33.020
but if anybody knows a good one,
uh,
if you learned how to play Double Bass,

414
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:35.150
obviously starting with Vinnie,
Paul is not an easy thing.

415
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.110
If you know a pan terra song that,
uh,
cause if you played double bass,

416
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:42.410
I would imagine that cowboys from hell is pretty straight forward.

417
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.710
Um,
as far as the tempo is not that bad.

418
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.170
If you know something else along those lines.

419
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:50.900
That's sort of the next thing because I always felt like if you're learning how

420
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:53.630
to play drums for me,
if you learn,
if you're a white guy,

421
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:58.580
he knew playing rock drums.
For me it was you started with ACDC,
right?

422
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.180
You learned the whole foreign,
the floor to for fucking thing.
Right?

423
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.950
And then the next thing I would do is then you move to like guns and roses,

424
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:11.030
appetite for destruction.
Well maybe we even went up to Charlie watts.

425
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.970
If you're going to baby step your way up so it's a little more busy bass drum,

426
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.260
you know.
And uh,

427
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.330
then I would go appetite for destruction and then from there it would basically

428
00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:25.060
be like whatever direction you want it to go.
And,

429
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:29.150
and here I am talking about drums again.
I don't know,

430
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.200
supposed to be talking about anyone.

431
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:34.910
What the fuck I'm supposed to be talking about here?
Um,
anyways,
Hey,

432
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:37.190
I saw that movie boyhood.
Did you guys see that shit?

433
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.510
It's pretty interesting where they have uh,
basically the,

434
00:25:41.511 --> 00:25:45.290
cause they shot the movie over 12 years and you get to watch this little boy

435
00:25:45.291 --> 00:25:48.200
that they cast grow up.
Oh my God.
Here we go again.

436
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:51.710
Domestic violence and sexual assaults are hard subjects for everyone to talk

437
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:54.500
about.
So let's show all these people crying,

438
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.053
<v 2>right?</v>

439
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.060
<v 1>Who does,
what are they going to do next?</v>

440
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.470
Funerals.

441
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.250
What you actually cared about the person who died or hard to talk about.

442
00:26:10.251 --> 00:26:15.100
And then I have to watch people crying
for the love of God.

443
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.200
Who were those fucking commercials for?

444
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:24.410
Does the person who sexually assault someone just sees Hillary swank crying and

445
00:26:24.481 --> 00:26:29.010
then goes,
you know what,
I'm going to stop sexually assaulting people.
I don't,

446
00:26:29.011 --> 00:26:33.360
I don't for the fucking life of me who doesn't care about victims

447
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.080
of basically anything.
Did the what did they,

448
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.780
are they trying to move me to do what?
What are they trying to do?

449
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.110
I think they're trying to get my

450
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.360
<v 4>money on some level,
right?</v>

451
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.920
So that they can siphon off 20% of it so they can go out and go buy themselves a

452
00:26:50.921 --> 00:26:54.370
pink Bentley and then they throw some money at the,
uh,
you know,

453
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.130
no more backhands docket org,
whatever the fuck they're doing.

454
00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.110
I just for the life of me,

455
00:26:59.111 --> 00:27:03.550
those fucking goddamn commercials and as annoying as those are,

456
00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:07.570
I don't understand why you kicking other team's fucking ass for 55 minutes and

457
00:27:07.571 --> 00:27:11.680
then decide to lay down on the goddamn ground for the final,
your own choice.

458
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.200
<v 5>Okay.</v>

459
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.910
<v 4>Your own fucking choice.
Um,
God dammit.</v>

460
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.820
I liked it.
I liked Seattle.
I really liked that fucking team,

461
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:24.630
but I just cannot stand all the fucking pomp and circumstance around it.

462
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.780
Did you guys see that they have two giant screens,

463
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.820
allegedly measuring how loud the fucking crowd is?
I mean,

464
00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:37.110
isn't it enough that they built a fucking stadium to try to just hold those

465
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:40.800
people's hands and to trying to sound like they give a fuck?

466
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:47.030
What else do they have to do to coerce these people into cheering every God damn

467
00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:47.461
game.

468
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:52.461
They gotta have some fucking war vet or fucking 80 at eight 1980s action hero

469
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.270
come out and wave a fucking Hanky to get them all excited.
You're not excited.

470
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.300
It's a fucking playoff game.

471
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.810
You're going to try to be the first team to repeat and like 10 fucking years.

472
00:28:03.811 --> 00:28:05.370
That's not enough excitement.

473
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.720
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

474
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.021
<v 4>You know,</v>

475
00:28:07.021 --> 00:28:10.650
you need frank Stallone to come out there and swing a dirty diaper over his

476
00:28:10.651 --> 00:28:13.230
fucking oh yeah.
Try.
We're supposed to give a fuck.

477
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:15.983
<v 5>Ah,</v>

478
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.390
<v 4>worst stressed fans.
Who are you going with?</v>

479
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.530
Honorary mentions gotta be the black hole.
Oakland Raiders.

480
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.300
That absolute fucking shit.
Show of humanity.

481
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.200
I would say Cleveland Browns,
the dog pound.
If they put them on TV more.

482
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.980
Remember that when they used to bark at the camera and,

483
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.590
and dog biscuits and you're supposed to sit at home going,
wow,

484
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.600
these people are crazy.

485
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.260
They had money,

486
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.910
legal tender to buy football tickets and they went to their assigned seat.

487
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.550
Uh,
Jesus fucking Christ with the pretend crazy.
I gotta be honest with you.

488
00:28:58.551 --> 00:29:02.720
The person who's really just going to fucking knock you out and make you
fucking,

489
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.170
you know,
ate the rest of your meals for the rest of your life.

490
00:29:06.171 --> 00:29:11.030
Sipping through a fucking Straw is not the guy that's dressed up like a dog or

491
00:29:11.031 --> 00:29:14.480
the dude with the spikes coming out of his fucking shoulder pads.

492
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.630
It's going to be that quiet guy with the dirty hat.

493
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.710
The dude with the neck tattoo,

494
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.330
it's going to be that person because they know that they're crazy and they know

495
00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:27.660
that they're going to fuck somebody up.

496
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:31.820
And the last thing they want to do is fucking puts somebody in a coma and then

497
00:29:31.821 --> 00:29:35.090
run out of a stadium,
dress like big bird.
Cause they're going to get caught.

498
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.830
They want it,
they want to blend in with the fucking crowd.
Wouldn't you think?

499
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.100
Am I out of my mind to think that shit?

500
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:47.600
<v 1>I have no idea.
So anyways,
I just heard a fucking plane fly over my head.</v>

501
00:29:47.601 --> 00:29:51.350
I'm actually studying for my exam next month to get my,
uh,

502
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.280
my license and I'm not going to fly here for the next uh,

503
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.620
couple of weeks due to my schedule and all that type of shit.

504
00:29:57.621 --> 00:30:02.510
So I am literally studying,
um,
bringing my notebooks with me,

505
00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.780
taking practice tests.
Ah Shit.

506
00:30:05.781 --> 00:30:07.640
I should have had some of that stuff in front of me.

507
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.420
I should have taken one of those God damn test all this type of shit.

508
00:30:11.421 --> 00:30:16.340
You have to know.
If you're flying east to west and you slow down,

509
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.990
you know which way's the needle going to point as they can to point down towards

510
00:30:20.991 --> 00:30:23.120
the south of the north on your fucking compass.

511
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.550
I already can't even fucking remember.

512
00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:27.200
I've answered that question so many fucking times.

513
00:30:27.201 --> 00:30:30.290
They still forget when you're flying east,

514
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.390
when you fly east to west,

515
00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:38.860
you fly at an even altitude plus 500 west to east.

516
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:45.100
You fly an odd plus 500 so you wouldn't fly at 5,000 you fly at 5,500 you go on

517
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.911
the other way.

518
00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:51.560
You'd fly four thousand five hundred and four thousand all of that shit plus all

519
00:30:51.561 --> 00:30:53.990
this shit about the weather.
All right.

520
00:30:53.991 --> 00:30:58.340
What do you go to your second half is starting.
How about fucking Amygdala?

521
00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.020
Is this guy been stepping up or what?
I was like most people,
I thought the guy,

522
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.950
like every time he went to go pick up his helmet,

523
00:31:03.951 --> 00:31:06.830
he blew out his hamstring and Al of a sudden to me he had such a fucking,

524
00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:10.880
I didn't really talk about the game last week.
I was so fucking,
uh,

525
00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.470
on my period about the Dez Bryant catch.
That wasn't a catch.

526
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.390
And uh,
I dunno,
when am I going to learn?

527
00:31:20.391 --> 00:31:23.540
I can't fucking have the TV on and try to fucking riff on this God damn thing.

528
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.800
<v 4>Think.
Oh by the way,
can we talk about that lady?
The fucking,</v>

529
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.940
there's a woman out there.
Um,

530
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.590
she fucking was married to a guy who was a billionaire.
She's getting a divorce.

531
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:42.430
The guy wrote her a check just under a billion dollars and she turned it down.

532
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.650
Now I know what a lot of people are thinking.
What a fucking gold digging whore.

533
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.570
This is right up bills.
Alley.
I know what I'm going to do.

534
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.790
I'm going to tweet a fucking link to this article and this will get them going

535
00:31:57.791 --> 00:32:00.190
on the podcast and then he'll have a shit fit.

536
00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:05.080
And I'll laugh as I'm sitting in my cubicle.
Well,
surprise,
surprise.

537
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.630
I'm not really having a shit fit about this cause I don't think it's about the

538
00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:13.920
money.
This is the deal.
This broad.
All right,

539
00:32:13.921 --> 00:32:18.180
this fucking twinkle toes here and I know a little fucking sugar tits here.

540
00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:22.920
She married this guy.
This guy was worth 50 million bucks.
He was an oil man.

541
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.610
Get off my fucking property right now.
Global warming.

542
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.870
Good.
I liked that.
There's a hole in the ozone layer.

543
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.980
Makes me feel like I'm closer to God,
right?
He's an oil man.

544
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.940
Hey,
I'll tell you what,
Mr President,
I mean,

545
00:32:39.941 --> 00:32:41.560
know why I have to call you Mr President.

546
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.190
I fucking put you in office with my God damn money.

547
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.340
Look at me when I'm talking to you or bomber.

548
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.263
<v 0>Alright.</v>

549
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:56.100
<v 4>My granddaddy put that dictator in fucking power and he was supposed to give us,</v>

550
00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.510
are a little gold little shit there,
right?

551
00:32:58.511 --> 00:33:02.140
He's supposed to give us our liquid gold.
Right?
He ain't doing it no more.

552
00:33:02.141 --> 00:33:05.080
You gotta go over there.
You got to take that fucker out.
You understand me?

553
00:33:05.081 --> 00:33:07.870
I'll give a fuck how you do it.
He's an oil man.

554
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.320
It's a fucking oil man.
Alright,

555
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.830
he's got slim Whitman on laser disk,
right?

556
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:22.940
Oh,
it's Irish.
What was the fucking Slim Whitman?
He sold over 9 million records.

557
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.870
Um,
anyways,
I'm all over the fucking map.
You'll see I'm back to me.

558
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.100
I'm not looking at the TV anymore.

559
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.453
<v 0>MMM.</v>

560
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.100
<v 4>So this fucking guy he's got,
he's got a $50 million business.</v>

561
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:39.140
This,
he already has this.
And this woman does not sign a fucking,

562
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.320
he doesn't sign a prenup with the woman.
According to her,

563
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:45.590
she didn't take the billion dollar payout because now 26,
27,

564
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:47.390
28 fucking years later,
they going for doors.

565
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.410
This guy's company is worth $20 billion according to her.

566
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.123
<v 0>All right?</v>

567
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:57.420
<v 4>Nay is the thing.
She's like,
I was with this guy and I supported him and blah,</v>

568
00:33:57.421 --> 00:34:00.360
held down the fucking home front and all that.
That's gotta be worth something.

569
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:04.770
This was fucking crazy to me.
It's like,
you know,
with all due respect,
sweetheart,

570
00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.060
this guy made 50 million without you.

571
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.420
<v 0>Okay,</v>

572
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.040
<v 4>look,
I could see if the guy had a couple hundred grand in the bank.
All right?</v>

573
00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:16.240
Maybe.
All right.
Whatever.

574
00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.193
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

575
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.870
<v 4>You make $50 million.
Give me a fucking break.</v>

576
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.600
You started out with nothing and you worth $50 million.
Are you fucking,

577
00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:30.190
you know what you're doing at that point.
Once you have $50 million,
that's,

578
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.320
that's when,
that's when you got your own.

579
00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:36.160
You can starting to have your own plane.
You're in a gated community.

580
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:38.860
You got your own security system,
you know,

581
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.060
you fucking kill somebody and the cops go down to your house and they're talking

582
00:34:43.061 --> 00:34:44.770
to your lawyer and the driveway is,

583
00:34:44.771 --> 00:34:48.310
you're sitting there eating fucking escargo on an English muffin and they're

584
00:34:48.311 --> 00:34:50.440
asking your fucking lawyer,
if you,

585
00:34:50.441 --> 00:34:54.850
if you wouldn't mind turning yourself in over the next six,
seven days,

586
00:34:54.851 --> 00:34:58.390
you like that level,
fucking rich.
And once you that level rich,
it's fall.

587
00:34:58.391 --> 00:34:59.650
It's all fucking downhill.

588
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:00.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

589
00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.780
<v 4>You meet and the people that are running the world,</v>

590
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.750
you meet the people in the Bilderberg group.
Yeah.

591
00:35:05.751 --> 00:35:08.660
Meet the people in the other groups that I don't know about or what the fuck

592
00:35:08.661 --> 00:35:12.500
they talk about,
but I pretend like I do.
You're at that level of fucking wealth.

593
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.263
<v 0>All right?</v>

594
00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:19.270
<v 4>So this fucking guy grows it to $20 billion and she gets a check for a billion</v>

595
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.350
jet basically.
And,
uh,
she says she doesn't want it.

596
00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:24.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

597
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.340
<v 4>She wants more.
So everybody is saying that she's a gold digger whore.</v>

598
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.600
You know what I really think it is?

599
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.630
And she's saying that she supported them and helped to build,

600
00:35:31.631 --> 00:35:32.740
say go fuck yourself.

601
00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:33.773
<v 0>All right,</v>

602
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.010
<v 4>let's,
let's just say for whatever fucking,</v>

603
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 1>I met an unknown lady Gaga in the East Village 10,
12 fucking years ago.</v>

604
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.950
Right?
And she's down there ripping off Madonna songs or whatever.
I'm like,

605
00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:49.890
you know what?
There's something about her though.
You know,
she's got nice legs.

606
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:53.670
He's getting a nice ass.
I mean,
I like the imperfections.
I like the giant nose.

607
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.520
Look at me.
I got red fucking hair.
It's falling out.

608
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.730
I think we could make a good couple.
You know what?
Both the mess,
two negatives,

609
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:01.410
make a positive.
We'll make a beautiful baby.

610
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:04.390
So I started fucking hanging out with the next thing you know,
we fall in love,

611
00:36:04.391 --> 00:36:07.800
Garrett.
Um,

612
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.340
so then we think,
uh,
all right.
You know,
we get married.

613
00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:19.100
Okay.
And let's just say whatever I'm doing,
I'm fucking,
I make keys.

614
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:23.080
That's what I do.
That's my job.
Okay.
And she's out down there.

615
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.860
She's down in the village and she's fucking,
you know,

616
00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:28.910
she's making her own meat dress.
You know,
she's going out,

617
00:36:28.911 --> 00:36:31.880
she's making money in a coffee house and she goes right to the Deli and she buys

618
00:36:31.881 --> 00:36:35.300
more meat.
She's investing in herself,
she's building her career,

619
00:36:35.301 --> 00:36:37.610
she's playing the fucking piano,
she's coming home.
And she's like,

620
00:36:37.611 --> 00:36:41.510
what do you think of this?
And I'm like,
God,
Hey,
right,
I'm over there.

621
00:36:41.511 --> 00:36:43.640
I'm knitting a fucking sweater.
You know,

622
00:36:43.641 --> 00:36:46.120
I've got a pot roast in the Goddamn oven or whatever.
Okay.

623
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.000
And then she becomes lady Gaga.
I get to quit my fucking job,

624
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.980
Mr Gaga.
I get to go on Oprah and sit there silently,

625
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:59.060
you know,
as Oprah talks to lady for fucking an hour.

626
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.500
And then finally she says,
Whoa,
what do you see it here?

627
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:05.450
And then I already have some prewritten speech about how I'm Gaga about Gaga,

628
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.900
Gaga for Gaga or whatever the fuck happens,
right?

629
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:14.360
And let's just say in the end to all of that,
I'm walking down the fucking hall,

630
00:37:14.361 --> 00:37:19.070
blinded by her gold records or platinum records and all that shit.

631
00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:22.790
Every morning when I go to brush my teeth,
I got to fucking,
I got to put on my,

632
00:37:22.791 --> 00:37:26.900
uh,
my amber visions just to get there so I don't fucking walk into the walk in

633
00:37:26.901 --> 00:37:30.580
closet instead of the bathroom,
let's say at the end of that,

634
00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:34.990
she gets sick of me and she kicks me to the fucking curb.
All right?

635
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:40.330
And let's say she's worth $100 million and she turns around and says,

636
00:37:40.331 --> 00:37:43.120
I'm going to give you bill.
I'm going to write you a check.

637
00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.280
Let's do the same thing.
Let's say I said 20 billion.

638
00:37:46.281 --> 00:37:48.460
Just say she's worth 20 million.
And she says,
Bill,

639
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:52.060
I'm going to give you $1 million.
And you know what I'm going to say?

640
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:54.070
I want to say thank you,
lady Gaga.

641
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.390
<v 5>Okay?</v>

642
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.930
<v 1>It was awesome.
I enjoyed,
I was just making keys.</v>

643
00:37:58.931 --> 00:38:03.280
I wasn't going to make $1 million in my lifetime.
All right,

644
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.750
I'm going to take this money and I'm going to pay my taxes on it,

645
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.450
but to get myself a little fucking house,

646
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.960
<v 5>okay?</v>

647
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.970
<v 1>You know,
and I'm going to make keys in the back of it.</v>

648
00:38:13.971 --> 00:38:16.360
I'm going to get my life back and I'm going to find,
I have,

649
00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:18.430
God knows you gave me plenty of fog and I would buy,

650
00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:22.010
you know what I would do with that?
I would go buy a fuck.
Everybody needs keys.

651
00:38:22.011 --> 00:38:26.800
Touchdown.
Who the fuck was that?

652
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:32.420
Who've just scored that Nate's salt.
Just scored his first,
first touchdown ever.

653
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.370
Nice.
23 seven.
Oh,

654
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.390
<v 4>did we match up better against the packers?
So anyway,</v>

655
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:42.550
I'll look at our two cheaters talking there

656
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.310
on the sidelines to convicted Cheetahs.
That was a nice play.

657
00:38:49.311 --> 00:38:52.850
That was nice place.
How'd you like the video?
I love the video.
Um,

658
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:56.560
anyways,
you're going to have a sense of humor,
but you don't fucking team,

659
00:38:56.561 --> 00:39:01.120
don't you?
Most people don't,
but I do.
Um,
anyways,

660
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.580
so let's go back here.
Uh,
yeah,
she gave me 1 million bucks.

661
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:10.090
What I would do is I would find a house.

662
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.100
<v 5>Okay.</v>

663
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.970
<v 4>That cost,
like,
I don't know,
like 150 grand,</v>

664
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.660
you know?

665
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:23.660
And I would put down a ridiculous amount of money on it and then I put the rest

666
00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:27.060
of the money away and I would start cutting keys again out of the back of my

667
00:39:27.061 --> 00:39:31.530
house and I get that business going and I would fucking build it up.

668
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.520
And then I go on to a set of farmers only.com I go on like a key makers only.com

669
00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:42.090
and I try to meet somebody else.
That's what the fuck I would do.

670
00:39:42.091 --> 00:39:44.250
I would never try to take her money.
It'd be like,
you know what?

671
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.660
I know I gave you support.
I know I said that was a beautiful song.

672
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:53.760
I know you wrote a couple songs about us instead of Dear Ben,

673
00:39:53.761 --> 00:39:57.600
you wrote,
dear bill,
I get it,
but I can't sing.

674
00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.960
I can't play a fucking piano.
Whose kid know?

675
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:05.370
We both know why I lived the life I live for the last 10 years.

676
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.630
It was because of you,

677
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:11.700
lady Gaga and the think I got to live that life.
And in the end of it,

678
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:16.000
you're going to give me 1 million bucks to leave.
Yeah.
You're a fucking sates.

679
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:22.170
<v 2>I still love you lady Gaga,
even though you don't love me anymore.</v>

680
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:25.860
I don't know why you love me in the,

681
00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.400
that's probably why you liked such wonderful thought there.

682
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.160
Connects with an entire demographic of people.

683
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.640
<v 4>Continued success.
Thank you for that million dollars.</v>

684
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.540
And I would fucking leaf.
All right.

685
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.040
I got too much fucking pride to sit there.

686
00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:49.080
If somebody doesn't fucking want me

687
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:52.730
to then try to take everything they got.
I mean,
just,
I,

688
00:40:52.731 --> 00:40:55.590
I couldn't fuck the second,
somebody didn't want me around like,
all right,
Jeez.

689
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.590
I didn't know it was annoying you.
I get it.
Sorry.

690
00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:03.440
Can I grab my things now?
Do you want to want me to send somebody else?

691
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.620
I would just get the fuck out of there.
Um,
so anyway,

692
00:41:07.621 --> 00:41:12.150
so that seems to be,
you know,
this lady here that she,
she got $1 billion,

693
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.380
um,
and she says it's not enough.
What I honestly think it is,

694
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.440
I just think it's an emotional thing for this woman.

695
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.740
I don't think it's a money thing because you can't spend that.

696
00:41:22.741 --> 00:41:27.330
You can't spend all that fucking money.
Right.
Did you guys,

697
00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:30.630
they actually showed a copy of the,
uh,

698
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:35.430
of the check that this dude to his ex wife,

699
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.890
he didn't write it on one of those business checks,
you know,

700
00:41:37.891 --> 00:41:41.190
that are sorta extra long and the whole extra area of the memo section that you

701
00:41:41.191 --> 00:41:44.070
write stuff,
he wrote it on like a personal little check,

702
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:47.340
like the same kind of check,
like you know,
somebody live in week to week.

703
00:41:47.341 --> 00:41:52.200
There's the one was a little checkbooks.
He wrote a check for like 989 million,

704
00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.790
$899,000 and 31 cents,
whatever the fuck it was.

705
00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:02.700
And I think what he did was,
it's guys obvious,
I dunno what the fuck.

706
00:42:02.701 --> 00:42:03.660
Maybe he's just good at business.

707
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.900
I think he just sat down after they decided on the number and I bet he did it

708
00:42:09.511 --> 00:42:12.900
right in front of her after 26 fucking years.

709
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.890
Okay.
He's walking away,

710
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.740
he's leaving and he just sits down and he's just writing money just to make her

711
00:42:22.741 --> 00:42:26.880
leave.
And he just sits down and goes,
scribble,
scribble,
scribble,

712
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:32.250
sign,
sign,
sign dot.
The I cross the fucking t,
tears it out.

713
00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.630
He'd go beat it,
lady.

714
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:38.250
I just think it came across like that and it fucking pisses her off.

715
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.000
And she's just like,
this is the thing,

716
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:46.170
the worst thing you can have when a woman's breaking up with you or if you're

717
00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:49.260
breaking up with a woman,
is if she's not over you,
if she's over you,

718
00:42:49.261 --> 00:42:52.620
it's going to go smoothly.
You don't have to deal with her fucking,
you know,

719
00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.940
putting up your,
your pet rabbit and a god damn stew.
All right?

720
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.570
But if they're not over you,
you got a fucking let them down easy.

721
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:04.830
You can't just push them down.
The emotional elevator shaft.
All right,

722
00:43:04.831 --> 00:43:07.740
you're going to have a major fucking problem.
And I think this guy,

723
00:43:07.741 --> 00:43:11.640
he just fucking fired off the check.
Like he was paying another bill and I,

724
00:43:11.641 --> 00:43:15.090
she just was insulted by that.
And she's think doing the math.
And I had like,

725
00:43:15.091 --> 00:43:15.331
you know,

726
00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:18.360
this motherfucker's gonna actually you talked a little bit about this on the

727
00:43:18.361 --> 00:43:21.210
Chris Layton podcast,
so I forgive me if there's a little bit of overlap,

728
00:43:21.211 --> 00:43:23.670
but I just wanted to hear what he thought about it.
Um,

729
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.110
<v 5>okay.</v>

730
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.820
<v 4>I think that uh,
Aye.</v>

731
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.810
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

732
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:34.490
<v 4>I dunno.
I just think that they want you,
they want you to hurt.</v>

733
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.830
They just want you to hurt.
I don't know what it is.
Not all of them,

734
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:40.664
just some of them.

735
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.840
And I think that she didn't get a sad enough of a satisfied heart.

736
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:48.260
Look on this guy's face.
There wasn't enough pain.

737
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:53.600
I think he just treated her like he had to get the gutters fixed and at some

738
00:43:53.601 --> 00:43:56.630
professional come over and did it and he just fired off this fucking check and

739
00:43:56.631 --> 00:43:57.740
it just pissed her off.

740
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.150
They all cause she's more than taking care of for the rest of her fucking life.

741
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:04.310
Anything that you could ever watch,
it's all good.

742
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.510
But I think the fact that he still has so much more money and it didn't hurt him

743
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:09.620
to write that check

744
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.700
that and she knows that he has enough money to get like,

745
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.210
you know when you got $20 billion,

746
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.600
there's like a Victoria secret model that will pretend to give a fuck about you

747
00:44:21.601 --> 00:44:23.040
for a good year,
year and a half.

748
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.340
And you could do that for the rest of your life as you're ride around in

749
00:44:26.341 --> 00:44:29.820
Ferrari's now her,
she's a woman,
guys don't work that way.

750
00:44:29.821 --> 00:44:31.500
We don't really give a shit money.

751
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.520
<v 1>You know,
one more like enamored by looks,
you know,</v>

752
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.600
it's both of our fucking weaknesses.
Whatever you guys are into stuff.

753
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.770
We were into fucking
tits and ass.

754
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.130
So which is why you know,

755
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:50.150
we will date somebody is dumb as a fucking rock and you will also date some ugly

756
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:54.400
old balding Douche,
you know,
because they can take care of you.

757
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.190
It's kind of what we do.
So I'm not really,

758
00:44:56.191 --> 00:44:58.650
a lot of people wanted me to go off on her like she's a gold digging whores.

759
00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.970
I don't think she has.
I think she's,

760
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:04.680
I think she's hurt and she's heard how easy this guy is.

761
00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:07.800
Just getting over.
I know.
All you guys are sitting there going like,
dude,

762
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:11.010
what the fuck?
He's writing her a check for $1 billion.
I know that hurts,
dude.

763
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:15.960
You got $20 billion.
Come on man.
If that's true,
if it's true,

764
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:19.720
and you got $20 billion outright,
yeah.

765
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.280
Fucking check for up for a bill.
That wouldn't hurt me at all.
There you go.

766
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.960
Big Bang.
Boom.
Bated whistle on Dixie.
Jesus Christ.

767
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:31.590
The fucking interest alone on that money you'd get by the time you walked down

768
00:45:31.591 --> 00:45:35.760
the driveway or she walks down the driveway leaving you,

769
00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:40.470
you're money is probably already made fucking $30 million.
The fuck.
Do you care?

770
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.310
Um,
I know he's probably,
that's obviously not 20 billion liquid.

771
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:49.340
It's got a lot of that tied up and Derek,
right?
Some giant fucking ranches,

772
00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:53.700
some oil rags trucks.
Um,

773
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.880
other that Pat's van
that look like Jim Loleta.

774
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.540
Um,
comedian.
I,
I knew back in Boston,
uh,

775
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.370
drinking is Sam Adams there.
Anyways,

776
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.400
it's 24 to seven nine oh nine left to go in the third quarter.

777
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:15.840
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

778
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.400
<v 1>Patriots d is looking good,</v>

779
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:21.420
but I just don't think there's anything in the AFC that was,
is really going to,

780
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:25.620
uh,
can get you ready for what Seattle's going to be bringing on a d.

781
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:30.380
At least a defensive level.
Uh,
I dunno,

782
00:46:30.381 --> 00:46:33.770
that was,
I probably one of the worst games is a pro that Russell Wilson has had.

783
00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:38.150
I have no,
I really don't have,
I don't have any idea what's going to happen.

784
00:46:38.151 --> 00:46:41.020
I like if the Patriots play Seattle in the Superbowl,

785
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:45.230
it will not surprise me if we win or we get absolutely ass raped.

786
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:50.120
I have no fucking idea.
I've watched that little amount of football,
um,

787
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.120
this year because I've been so fucking busy.
Um,

788
00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.900
but that's going to be amazing.
And how about Robert Kraft?
Huh?

789
00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.970
I know I've mentioned this before.
What a fucking owner.

790
00:47:00.971 --> 00:47:02.650
He is three coaching hires,

791
00:47:02.651 --> 00:47:07.651
Bill Parcells unknown Pete Carroll as far as like at the pro level and then bill

792
00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:12.340
Bellacheck.
Yeah,
it's pretty cool.
That now is a,

793
00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.120
he's basically these two guys looking like they're going to face each other and

794
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:20.640
the super bowl.
Uh,
I would love to hear that conversation.
I wonder if,

795
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.480
I wonder if they've ever talked since he fired them.
Sure.

796
00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.430
We sent them some sort of fucking,
um,

797
00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.010
the fuck was it one 800.
What was that thing?

798
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.990
<v 4>When I lost my shit when I was reading it and I can't remember.</v>

799
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:36.910
What the fuck was it?
Fruit baskets.org.
I forget me undies.
Everybody.

Oh,

You got no sweaty balls.
Oh,

804
00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:57.420
Yay.
You can talk to the fucking chick.
Well,

805
00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.310
get yourself some know,
more sweaty balls.
90%.

806
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:08.250
That's the percent of your life that you're in your underwear there,
right?
Um,

807
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.420
and underwear,
it gets old fast.

808
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.300
You know that feeling of putting on old saggy underwear.

809
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.140
You need to know the feeling of great fitting underwear that it's two times

810
00:48:17.141 --> 00:48:21.070
softer than cotton.
You need to know about me undies,

Me undies.com [inaudible] is the most comfortable underwear you will ever wear.

813
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.610
Four out of five ball bag.

814
00:48:29.611 --> 00:48:33.760
Say we love me undies and it's insane how good they make you feel.

815
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:34.810
They fit perfectly.

816
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.340
They don't ride up on your fucking ass crack and they literally pull moisture

817
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:43.360
away from your skin growth so you can stay cool.

818
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.650
Personalize.
I have mine on right now.
I didn't.

819
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.840
I had them on earlier and I am floating.
I wouldn't say I'm floating around.

820
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.170
I was comfortable.
You know what?

821
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:57.310
I wore them last night when I was pretending to be Vinnie Paul and that's the

822
00:48:57.311 --> 00:49:01.690
best I ever played live.
And who am I giving credit to?
Josh,

823
00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:05.200
Adam Meyers.
Nope.
Me undies.
Me undies.

824
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.290
I'm fucking butcher and double bass.

825
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:11.530
I can't even tell you how great I feel when I'm staying cool and comfortable

826
00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:15.970
down there all day.
Oh,
these are all examples of stuff that I'm supposed to say.

827
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.390
It's such a profound impact to the way I feel.

828
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:22.960
If don't say impact around your balls anyways,
they're great.

829
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.110
I've tried them on Gras for a first down.
I've tried them.

830
00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:30.340
They have cool styles for both men and ladies.
Oh good man.
He used to be under,

831
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:34.420
you know,
more clammy twats oh yeah.
And look great.

832
00:49:34.421 --> 00:49:37.000
Check out the photos yourself at me undies Dotcom.

833
00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:41.380
This quality would typically retail for two times the me Andy price according to

838
00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:01.150
I got to tell you,
I've warned them.
Uh,
they're great.
They're nice and thin too.

839
00:50:01.151 --> 00:50:03.700
You know what I mean?
They're not cumbersome.
So if you were,

840
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:06.880
if you one of those people that wears your hipster jeans,

841
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:11.140
you know where they're tight yet sagging off your lack of an ass,

842
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:15.250
I think that this is the underwear for you.
Then they come in very bright,

843
00:50:15.251 --> 00:50:18.100
noticeable.
Notice my ass colors,
I think.
I think,

844
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:20.440

869
00:51:54.181 --> 00:51:57.120
sitting here doing a podcast with the game on mute in the background.

870

is that what happened?

876
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.240
I was in a store the other day and one pack of razors is now 20 bucks.

877
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:21.720
One pack people.
That is crazy,

Say with me,
dollar shave club.com/burr.
All right.

903
00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.250
Hey,
I bought those Bruins.
Huh?

904
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.380
They finally for the first time this year put together a nice run there.
They,

905
00:53:57.381 --> 00:53:58.214
uh,

906
00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.840
they played six games without losing winning five in a row and they lost one and

907
00:54:02.841 --> 00:54:03.260
overtime,

908
00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.110
but they still picked up a point unless the other night they lost to the

909
00:54:06.111 --> 00:54:10.880
Columbus blue jackets.
But,
uh,
it's starting to hopefully play up to,
uh,

910
00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:16.010
up to their potential.
I love whenever,
whenever they have a fucking problem.

911
00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:16.581
Do you know,

912
00:54:16.581 --> 00:54:21.230
somebody actually texted me and they said that they should trade Lou Cheech or

913
00:54:21.231 --> 00:54:25.280
trade Brad Marshawn.
It's like,
are you fucking mind?
Yeah,

914
00:54:25.281 --> 00:54:27.470
let's trade the guys that get the fucking team going.

915
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:28.720
<v 5>Okay.</v>

916
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.780
<v 4>You know,
I just,
for the life of me,</v>

917
00:54:31.781 --> 00:54:35.710
I just don't understand the panic and they always pick like the star.

918
00:54:35.711 --> 00:54:40.560
I think people who say that just,
they don't watch the game,
they just fucking,

919
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.950
they just,
they watched the stars.
Like if the Patriots start losing this,

920
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.190
remember earlier this year,
they started blaming Tom Brady say,
and he's,

921
00:54:47.191 --> 00:54:50.700
is he past his prime?
Um,
I didn't think that,

922
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:52.600
but I was also one of those people that thought that the,

923
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:56.940
I thought the Patriots were finished after that.
Uh,
was it Kansas City game?

924
00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.150
And then we came against the Bengals.
I thought it was,
um,

925
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:06.570
I definitely thought that we were done,
um,
because I just felt like we kept,
uh,

926
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.050
I think he can hear it on one of my podcasts,

927
00:55:10.051 --> 00:55:13.980
I was saying how we had this formula where we would basically,

928
00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.530
<v 5>okay</v>

929
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:20.530
<v 4>have a veteran player and w right when the guy was getting his second or his</v>

930
00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:25.100
second to last or his last contract and he wanted big money,

931
00:55:25.101 --> 00:55:29.150
we would always trade the person away to stay under the cap or whatever.

932
00:55:29.151 --> 00:55:32.400
And then we'd play some with somebody that didn't have experience and then we

933
00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:34.070
would be,
we'd get that position for a while.

934
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:39.220
We just kept doing that all the way around on offense and defense and I,

935
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:42.800
I dunno,
Trade Logan Mankins look like a bad fucking move,

936
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:47.330
but the genius of Bella check when the drive a Brady,
um,

937
00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:49.580
and the defense and all that,
I was wrong.

938
00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:54.590
So I've been wrong about a lot of shit and I don't think we match up well

939
00:55:54.591 --> 00:55:59.180
against Seattle.
So I think I,
I'm hoping I'm going to be wrong against that.

940
00:55:59.181 --> 00:56:02.510
Granted there's still,
you know,
plenty of fucking time left in this game.

941
00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:07.780
I'm talking about it like we already won.
Um,
anyways,
how far into this are we?

942
00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.160
46 minutes.
I forget how long I talked to the,

943
00:56:10.161 --> 00:56:13.430
I don't want to feel like you're going to talk to at least 15 minutes.
Um,

944
00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.530
so anyways,
I'm gearing up for this.
Um,

945
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:17.100
<v 5>okay.</v>

946
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.570
<v 4>Does standup tour that I have coming up and a,
I'm going to be playing,</v>

947
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:24.510
doing a United stand up,
running my hour hit flappers

948
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:28.590
<v 1>possibly another place going to be bouncing around La all this week.
Uh,</v>

949
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.100
getting ready to go.
Just going back to being a fucking comedian again.

950
00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:36.150
I can't wait to do it.
I am so ridiculously excited to,
uh,

951
00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:40.740
go out to Southeast Asia and uh,
even all this time,
you know,

952
00:56:40.741 --> 00:56:43.140
I'm not spending a lot of time in any of these places,

953
00:56:43.141 --> 00:56:47.730
but this is how I handled Europe.
I just kept going there,
just business,
business,

954
00:56:47.731 --> 00:56:49.800
business.
And then once I started selling tickets,

955
00:56:49.801 --> 00:56:53.730
I was actually able to slow down and,
uh,
taking some sites.

956
00:56:53.731 --> 00:56:57.090
So I plan on doing that throughout Southeast Asia.

957
00:56:57.091 --> 00:57:00.210
So there's some quick things then I'm going to do when I go to Hong Kong,

958
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:01.950
I don't know how long I'm going to be there,

959
00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:04.410
but at some point I'm going to get some fucking dumplings.

960
00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:05.573
<v 9>Touchdown.</v>

961
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.400
<v 1>Sorry.
There we go.
Now it's going to be 31 to seven.</v>

962
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:14.780
So it's looking pretty good here.

963
00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:16.643
<v 6>MMM.</v>

964
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.650
<v 1>Paul Versey would've called this game at 14.
Nothing.</v>

965
00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:22.310
<v 6>It's all,
it's all</v>

966
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:26.040
<v 1>I got to smoke a cigar with that guy.
Jesus Christ.
It's been a while.</v>

967
00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.720
So when I go to a Hong Kong,
I'm going to,
uh,

968
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:33.270
I'm definitely gonna try to get dumpling somewhere.
When I go to India,

969
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.270
uh,
India I think is going to be,

970
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:39.330
I don't know,

971
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:43.350
I think that that's going to be actually a bigger culture shock than when I go

972
00:57:43.351 --> 00:57:46.680
to like Shanghai in and,
um,

973
00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.360
and Hong Kong,
this might be ignorant of me,

974
00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:55.780
but I feel like I've gone to a Chinatown enough times.

975
00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:57.921
You know what I mean?

976
00:57:57.921 --> 00:58:01.220
I've gone to San Francisco and gone down there and you walk there and there's

977
00:58:01.221 --> 00:58:03.910
just so many people,
uh,

978
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:08.950
Asian people that you follow for the most part feel like you are somewhere in

979
00:58:08.991 --> 00:58:13.610
Asia.
But I've never been to,
towns don't really have like a little India,

980
00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.500
you know,
they have little Italy,
Italy,
little Armenia,
Thai town,

981
00:58:18.501 --> 00:58:20.180
they'll have Chinatown on that type of stuff.

982
00:58:20.181 --> 00:58:23.420
But I've never gone to a place where I was just surrounded by nothing but Indian

983
00:58:23.421 --> 00:58:27.980
people.
So I think it's going to be a,
and an amazing experience.

984
00:58:27.981 --> 00:58:31.610
And I had a buddy of mine who actually one of my flight instructors was just

985
00:58:31.611 --> 00:58:36.410
over in Hong Kong and he said it's the coolest city he's ever been to hands

986
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:41.000
down,
which is so fucking awesome to hear.
Um,

987
00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:42.910
<v 5>okay.</v>

988
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:45.190
<v 1>And uh,
I also like China anyways just because they were,</v>

989
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:48.520
the underdogs were as far as ain't little.
I know about Asia,

990
00:58:48.521 --> 00:58:51.550
like Japan was signing kind of like the white people over there where they are

991
00:58:51.551 --> 00:58:51.791
like,

992
00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:56.110
we are the supreme people and we're now going to try to enslave everybody over

993
00:58:56.111 --> 00:58:58.780
there.
You know what I mean?
Um,
they were sorta the,

994
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:02.130
they are the European mentality and a,

995
00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.510
I don't know,
everybody else is sort of the underdog,
so I don't know.

996
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.490
There's just something about it.

997
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.500
Something I read about Bruce Lee one time I read this thing that uh,

998
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:12.170
<v 5>okay,</v>

999
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:14.960
<v 1>the Japanese back in the day so that the Chinese were animals.</v>

1000
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:16.803
<v 6>So</v>

1001
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:21.280
<v 1>sleep was fighting in this Chinese style,
defeating these shogun warriors.</v>

1002
00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:25.510
And after he kicks their ass in the movie,
he says,
by the way,
I'm not an animal.

1003
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:30.010
And in China they like the movie say to just stood up and gave a standing

1004
00:59:30.011 --> 00:59:33.370
ovation.
I was like,
that's the shit.
I hope that's true.
So anyways,

1005
00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.570
I'm looking forward to going over there and uh,

1006
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:40.571
it's killing me that I won't be anywhere near the Great Wall of China because a,

1007
00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.850
that's definitely on my bucket list.

1008
00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.270
But I figure if I keep going over to Hong Kong and a,

1009
00:59:46.271 --> 00:59:48.160
I can build up a following over there.

1010
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:52.360
Eventually I'll make enough money where I could then blow it on another.

1011
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.460
I figured I gotta jump on another plane.

1012
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.150
I don't even know where the Great Wall is.
Is it in Beijing?

1013
00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:03.730
I know I can't jump in a fucking Prius over there and drive to it.
Uh,

1014
01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.990
I would be terrified to do it because I figured once I get out of Hong Kong,

1015
01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.850
the road signs are no longer in English and I would be fucked.

1016
01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:18.530
Uh,
Singapore,
it fascinates me.
Uh,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1017
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:22.400
I am nervous that I am going to say something on stage that will get me caned.

1018
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:26.330
Uh,
I promise you if I get into that situation,

1019
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:31.331
I will try to remain calm enough before the first strike to yell out dough

1020
01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:36.350
Jesus.
Yo Jay Jay's before then and then any bitchy sounds I make after that.

1021
01:00:36.351 --> 01:00:39.560
I don't want to fucking hear it unless you got caned.
Um,

1022
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.470
and then I have all of Australia and New Zealand and uh,

1023
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:48.580
I just think it's going to be,
uh,
you know,
come on man.

1024
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:51.460
This is like some shit that people bid on it at the end of the fucking price is

1025
01:00:51.461 --> 01:00:54.130
right.
And I get to do it while telling jokes.
Man.
I'm pretty much,

1026
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.730
I'm pretty much stealing money.
Not to mention when I go over there,

1027
01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.370
my biggest fucking problem is going to be,
uh,

1028
01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.390
cigars because Cuban cigars or legal over there.

1029
01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:08.530
And I kind of made a new year's resolution that I was going to smoke only one a

1030
01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:12.940
week because you figure that's still 52 fucking cigars a year.

1031
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:16.960
That's a lot of fucking cigars.
Unless you smoke cigars,
then it's a joke.

1032
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.130
So,
um,
for the month of January,

1033
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:27.040
I unfortunately have already smoked five.
I smoked one at the Rose Bowl,

1034
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.930
then I smoked too during the Patriots game last week I spoke to in New Orleans

1035
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.060
and um,
that was going to smoke one today.
I was like,
I can't,

1036
01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:40.600
cause I'm already for the allotted time are already into February,

1037
01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.790
so I have to somehow get through this week and my first fucking a week of

1038
01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:50.530
Australia without smoking.
But I gotta tell ya today,
you know,

1039
01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.860
uh,
today it was tough.
I got a nice back porch area,

1040
01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:58.050
was really calling to me.
Jesus Christ.
I really,
I,
I,

1041
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.220
I am addicted to those fucking things.
I've got to admit it.

1042
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.520
I'm fucking addicted and I got to work on that.
But anyways,
yeah,

1043
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.360
that is the podcast for this week.
Uh,

1044
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:10.390
congratulations to the Seattle Seahawks franchise and all the fans that stayed

1045
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.880
it all the ones that were back there when the kingdom,
ah,

1046
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:21.910
my condolences to all fucking fans of the Green Bay packers.

1047
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:27.290
Um,
can anybody,
anybody who was in code,
there's gotta be somebody in coaching,

1048
01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.080
you know,
I don't give a shit what level you coach.

1049
01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:32.570
Can you please explain to me the prevent defense and just,

1050
01:02:32.571 --> 01:02:37.280
do you have any numbers?
It has to work way more than it doesn't work.

1051
01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:42.730
Um,
I don't know.
I just think as a fan,

1052
01:02:42.731 --> 01:02:46.390
I hate it because even if we win,
I still have to go to fucking,

1053
01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.730
the amount of stress that it puts me through just drives me up the fucking wall.

1054
01:02:51.731 --> 01:02:53.230
It's just like you've been kicking their ass.

1055
01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:55.900
Just keep kicking their fucking ass.
Can Anybody at coaching please?

1056
01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:57.730
For the love of God,
help me.
Oh,
by the way,

1057
01:02:57.731 --> 01:03:00.510
I had an epic battle with Yannis Pappas and uh,

1058
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.480
Paul Versey got the babe Ruth thing going again.

1059
01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.980
I know it bugs some of you guys,

1060
01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:08.860
but I know a lot of you guys enjoyed it and actually trying to beat those guys.

1061
01:03:08.861 --> 01:03:10.090
I mean it was a fucking two one one.

1062
01:03:10.091 --> 01:03:14.920
So I was taking my hits like to think I was dishing them out to um,

1063
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:16.670
oh by the way,
Paul version of the verse,

1064
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.780
he affects sat down with Yannis Pappas and they allegedly destroyed me on the

1065
01:03:19.781 --> 01:03:24.310
babe Ruth debate here.
Here's some interesting stats outside of Babe Ruth

1066
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.760
<v 4>to tell you why I feel like it was an inferior leak.
All right.</v>

1067
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:33.761
Ted Williams was the last guy to ever hit 400 he did it in 1941 nobody has done

1068
01:03:36.681 --> 01:03:37.514
it since.

1069
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:43.210
So that's 70 coming on 70 74 seasons going on 75 years.

1070
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.840
Nobody has hit 400 yet prior to the 1942 baseball season.

1071
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:52.503
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1072
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:57.890
<v 4>Hitting 400 had been done 28 times in a little over 60 years.</v>

1073
01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:00.163
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1074
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:05.130
<v 4>Every guy who did it was white and did it in an all white league.</v>

1075
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:06.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1076
01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.310
<v 4>And after 1941 it was never done again.</v>

1077
01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:15.200
Prior to 1941 they average somebody doing it almost every two years.

1078
01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.820
Two to two and a half years.
Two to three years.
Somebody hit 400 Honus,

1079
01:04:19.821 --> 01:04:24.800
Wagner,
ty Cobb and some Guy Ed Mcdermott or some shit.

1080
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.090
You know what they have in common?
All three of them.
Not only did they hit 400,

1081
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:31.460
they did it three fucking times.

1082
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.450
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1083
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:37.060
<v 4>And this is what funny,
I brought that up to Yannis and I go to,</v>

1084
01:04:37.061 --> 01:04:42.061
there was a guy in the 1817 or 1880s hit four 34 for the season and he goes,

1085
01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:45.720
oh,
that's ridiculous.

1086
01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:51.140
And it is ridiculous compared to 1925 hitting four 34 and 1875 is ridiculous,

1087
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:58.220
but 19 to 1925 as compared to 1965 to me is also ridiculous.

1088
01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:03.000
What'd you have during the all white error?
Okay.

1089
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:06.330
What you have is you have not only with Babe Ruth,

1090
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:09.120
you have straight across the board,

1091
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:14.330
unprecedented offensive numbers pick off by the Patriots.

1092
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:17.120
<v 10>Whoa.</v>

1093
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:23.680
<v 1>Um,
do you know when the 1930s I did a quick quick research.</v>

1094
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:28.240
I might be wrong for all you baseball heads out there every year in the 1930s

1095
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:32.080
except one year two when the RBI crown,

1096
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:36.850
you had to hit at least 170 rbis.
Honus Wagner,

1097
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:41.080
he hit 100 and 920,
I'm sorry.
Uh,
uh,
Hank Greenberg,

1098
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:46.300
Hank Greenberg had 191 fucking rbis.

1099
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:48.123
Okay.

1100
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:53.060
And what you noticed with all of these crazy fucking stats guys having 30 wins,

1101
01:05:53.061 --> 01:05:55.900
seasons,
guys pitching double headers,

1102
01:05:56.260 --> 01:06:00.760
guys win and 500 fucking games,
all of that shit.

1103
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:05.200
What you notice is this is ridiculous level of fucking stats.

1104
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:09.010
And then when the game becomes integrated,
all of a sudden those,

1105
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.090
those numbers go down and they level the fuck off.
All right?

1106
01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:17.080
And I really feel stats from the fifties,
sixties,

1107
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:20.600
70s touchdown patriots,
Lou Garrett Blunt.

1108
01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:25.480
We're going to the super bowl into the 80s,
um,

1109
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.210
into the 80s.

1110
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:33.190
Like those are left leveled off fucking numbers in some of the greatest pitchers

1111
01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:36.220
and some of the greatest hitters of all time played from the 50s into the

1112
01:06:36.221 --> 01:06:41.221
fucking eighties and none of them came anywhere close to winning,

1113
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.960
hitting long ball,

1114
01:06:43.961 --> 01:06:48.961
any of that fucking shit other than a Roger Maris who hits 61 home runs.

1115
01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:54.070
Okay.
I guess some,
I think mantle hit like 57 home runs or whatever.

1116
01:06:54.071 --> 01:06:56.050
But I'm saying,

1117
01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:01.650
and then all of a sudden you had a game that was just steeped in its past and

1118
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:05.800
all the great records and all the shit.

1119
01:07:05.801 --> 01:07:10.330
We're all held by these fucking guys whose baseball cars were inside a cigar

1120
01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:12.640
boxes.
All right?

1121
01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:16.750
And then you notice all of a sudden those records stuck getting broken again.

1122
01:07:16.751 --> 01:07:21.070
They live in up the ball.
They made the stadium smaller,
they livened up the ball,

1123
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:25.870
they made the stadium smaller and guys started doing steroids and still the most

1124
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:30.871
fucking rbis anybody ever hit was Manny Ramirez one 65 Sammy Sosa got one 60

1125
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:38.611
both of those guys were on roids and even they couldn't get 170 180 forget about

1126
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:43.840
191 nobody's hitting 400 I'm telling you.

1127
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.770
And you're also talking about like all the pitches back then,
the curve ball,

1128
01:07:47.771 --> 01:07:51.410
the slider,
split finger fastball,
cut fastball.

1129
01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.770
All of those pitches were being developed.

1130
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:59.550
So you had a guy like babe Ruth who had an any era monster talent showing up

1131
01:08:01.471 --> 01:08:05.050
day.
Yeah,
that guy's going to do some fucking damage and he's going to put up

1132
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:08.560
unprecedented fucking numbers for these guys to sit there.

1133
01:08:08.561 --> 01:08:13.561
And since you'd suggest that in 2014 15 if this guy fucking played that,

1134
01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:16.080
not only would he hit his hundred something home

1135
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.380
<v 4>runs,
he would also be a cy young award winning pitcher.</v>

1136
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:22.200
It doesn't even fucking make sense.

1137
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.883
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1138
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:30.810
<v 4>That a guy that talented could fucking exist and then never is there another guy</v>

1139
01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:34.380
that talented again.
And despite everything that you saw in a May,

1140
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:39.460
incredible athletes like Bo Jackson do nothing Bo Jackson did as far as

1141
01:08:40.541 --> 01:08:42.610
statistics go despite the fact,

1142
01:08:43.570 --> 01:08:44.060
<v 0>okay.</v>

1143
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:44.511
<v 4>That he was,</v>

1144
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:48.290
that he was arguably definitely gonna be a hall of Famer in baseball and

1145
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:52.400
arguably had the talent to be a hall of Famer in baseball.

1146
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:57.200
The fact that even what he did in his short time paled in comparison to what

1147
01:08:57.201 --> 01:09:00.740
Fuck Bay rooted Babe Ruth played in an all fucking white league.

1148
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.370
And some of you guys will argue while there was only 10 12 teams and it's like,

1149
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:05.270
fine,
okay,

1150
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:09.680
let's take today's baseball in whittle it all the way down to 12 teams with

1151
01:09:09.681 --> 01:09:13.700
those 12 teams,
then go back to being only white guys.
They wouldn't,

1152
01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.060
they would still be the best of the best.
Okay.

1153
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.940
Which when it's all legal and fair,

1154
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:23.000
seems to be predominantly Latino in that sport.

1155
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.370
So those people would not be allowed to play.

1156
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:27.560
And right there it becomes inferior.

1157
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:30.530
So I feel like I'm still given Babe Ruth.

1158
01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:31.720
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1159
01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.170
<v 4>600 plus home runs for his career.
All right,</v>

1160
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.320
but he would have had to have decided to either be a great pitcher or a great

1161
01:09:38.321 --> 01:09:42.300
hitter.
That's how it would have fucking gone down.
All right and

1162
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:43.510
<v 0>okay,</v>

1163
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:46.690
<v 4>that's it.
I'm not going to debate this any fucking more.</v>

1164
01:09:46.691 --> 01:09:51.691
I really feel that Babe Ruth played essentially you had an any era hall of fame

1165
01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:58.380
dominant fucking player that played against Division One college talent and I

1166
01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:03.370
think that is a fact and I don't give a fuck what you say.

1167
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:07.300
I think because everybody loves baseball.

1168
01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:12.340
They are just so steeped in that history that is absolutely sack religious

1169
01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:18.400
to talk about these fucking guys in the records that they had in their 500

1170
01:10:18.401 --> 01:10:22.630
fucking wins and all of this shit.
I'm telling you man,
come on at the beginning.

1171
01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:24.760
I maintain it.

1172
01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.840
Watching Colby score 80 something points in the two thousands is more.

1173
01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:34.450
I think that's more difficult to fucking do then to score a hundred points like

1174
01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:37.240
wilt Chamberlain in the 1960 [inaudible].
That's just how I feel.

1175
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:39.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1176
01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:43.530
<v 4>You know,
you got a hundred fucking years of,
this is what I did.</v>

1177
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:46.460
Defense wins championships.
So if you're going to be successful,

1178
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.680
they figured they would pitch around Babe Ruth.

1179
01:10:48.681 --> 01:10:52.070
They would figure out how they would figure out how to neutralize,

1180
01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:53.920
<v 0>okay,</v>

1181
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.960
<v 4>his talents.</v>

1182
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:56.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1183
01:10:56.370 --> 01:11:00.630
<v 4>Okay.
Do paypal's went up.
We was hitting against fucking an all white league.</v>

1184
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:04.410
He went up against a guy who sold shoes in the fucking off season.

1185
01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.530
Like these guys didn't even make enough fucking money.
I mean,
if you babe Ruth,

1186
01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:09.900
you did.
But this guy that,

1187
01:11:09.901 --> 01:11:12.540
the level of talent he was playing against was so piss poor.

1188
01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:14.070
This guy could out and booze.

1189
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:18.150
<v 1>Any cakes in hot dogs,
not even work out.</v>

1190
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.710
You know?
Look,
I'm not saying the guy was,
was,

1191
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.660
wasn't one of the greatest of all time.
But you know,

1192
01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:29.661
when John Goodman get selected to play you in the fucking movie a life for me,

1193
01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:33.690
give me a fucking break.
All right,
I'm done.
That's it.
That's the podcasts.

1194
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:37.010
Go Fuck yourself off all you drum heads out there are fans of Stevie Ray Vaughan

1195
01:11:37.011 --> 01:11:39.810
is music or just fans of Chris Leighton's.
Unbelievable drumming.

1196
01:11:39.811 --> 01:11:42.150
If you want to listen to have an extra podcast this week,
that's it.

1197
01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:43.680
Go fuck yourselves.
We'll talk to you next week.
