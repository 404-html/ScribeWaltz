00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.450
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:07.950
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.
Uh,
what the hell was it?

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.730
October 12,
2015 what's going on?
How are you?
I'm,

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.560
I'm recording this Sunday because as you're listening to this,
um,

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.180
unless I posted tonight,
Oh,
who's kidding,

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.320
who my podcasts guide posted cause I don't know how to do it.
Um,
I'll actually,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.220
I got some acting work,
uh,
Monday and Tuesday.
So it was always,

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.260
I never tell you what the hell I'm doing because you know,

9
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.650
you can get edited out and then you look like an asshole.
Like you say,

10
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.980
hey everybody,
look for me.
I'll be that guy in that thing.

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.200
And then all of a sudden you're not in it.
And then he goes,
Hey,

12
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.400
I thought you were going to be a nut,
you know,
laughing my ass off.

13
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.810
Epic fail actor Balding,
redheaded Con,
you know,
I got to deal with that all day.

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.110
So I usually don't say anything,
but I'm mean,
I'm excited.
It's going to be fun.

15
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:53.370
It's funny shit.
And,
uh,
so that's why I got to do over the next couple of days.

16
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:58.070
But,
um,
so it's football Sunday,
I'm recording this right,
is the,
uh,

17
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:02.760
the Patriots and cowboys game just ended,
I'm not going to gloat.
Um,

18
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.930
I know that that was a banged up,
a cowboy stem and come on,

19
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.630
I think the last play of the game when you guys,

20
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:14.250
your receiver beat our quarterback and the ball still sailed like eight feet

21
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:15.084
over.
His fucking,

22
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.880
I felt bad for them was at number 83.
I don't know who he is.

23
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.890
So I know he needs those stats.
They all need the stats.

24
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:27.300
That's how they make their money.
You know,
the end of the season when they're,

25
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:31.860
they're,
they're uh,
they're,
they're sports.
Uh,
agent comes in,
hey,

26
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:34.400
you'll need to the guy we now for nothing.
And the guy,
uh,

27
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.300
you had fucking 17 touchdowns.
So
after 16,

28
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.760
that means he fucking makes an extra 400 grand.

29
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.250
So with this guy comes up one short,

30
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.220
you think he's not going to be thinking about that.
You know,

31
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.890
when they have the cowboys Christmas party and they don't make the playoffs,

32
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.620
you don't think 83 is going to be staring at that fucking,
uh,

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.280
that radio contest winner that they had a quarterback.

34
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.010
I shouldn't talk shit about him,
you know,
I don't know anything about him either.

35
00:01:59.011 --> 00:01:59.844
But um,

36
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.630
that play really made me laugh because after the ball goes over 83,

37
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.710
his head,
I think that's his number,
right?

38
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.750
You see him yelling at the corner and the corner is kind of laughing back at him

39
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:15.540
and you know,
he was going like,
I fucking beat you again.

40
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.260
I should've had fucking 150 yards on you.

41
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.980
If this guy could fucking throw it to me and the other guy doesn't give a shit

42
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.830
cause he knows in the end,
right.
It's just going to show up on the stat sheet.

43
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.880
Who gives a shit?
So,
uh,
anyways,
so you know,

44
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:31.260
I felt bad for the cowboys.
You know what I mean?

45
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.810
Snakebit it just fucking snake pit and they looked like they were going to be

46
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.980
good.
Tony Romo gets heart bought it out to Donna.
All that bullshit.
You know,
but,

47
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:38.101
uh,

48
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:43.101
I do think on one level it was a justice by the football gods that the patriots,

49
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.910
who some people were suggesting,
you know,
if the Brady suspension went through,

50
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.830
could have been oh,
and four one and three,

51
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:52.500
two and two that were actually for now,

52
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.000
I think that that means the football gods know that Tom Brady did not cheat.

53
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.010
Okay.
Oh,

54
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.280
you guys can fucking roll your eyes and shake your heads all you want.

55
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.090
You know what the greatest thing about it is,
is I can't hear you right now.

56
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.200
Do you ever think about that?
I can't hear you,
but you can hear me.
So you,

57
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.980
you have to listen to this shit.
All right?
You don't have to,

58
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:17.020
but I know if you're listening to this shit right now,

59
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.340
you're probably doing something you don't want to be doing and you need to be

60
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.174
distracted.

61
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.080
So all you can do is sit there and hope that maybe it's going to get better or

62
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.860
you could fast forward through it.
Cause I'm gonna tell you right now,

63
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.610
I'm going to talk about this for another couple,
two or three minutes.

64
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:37.120
He might want to jump ahead.
You know,
if you're a fucking,

65
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.900
uh,
with a big crybaby,
but if you're a cult said,
you know,

66
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.640
it's such Saint Andrew luck his heart.
Man.

67
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:45.820
I want to go in there and I want the Patriots.
That guy just said,

68
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:49.540
I want to go in there and fuck somebody at the door.
Hold on a second.
Hold on.

69
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:52.980
Hang on.
All right,
I'm back.
Clean up.
Get over there.
Laid out.

70
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.690
This is what happens when you got a crazy pitbull.
You gotta make sure you wait,

71
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.780
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
You got to close all the doors so you don't need anyone

72
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.070
lay down.
All right.
Sorry.
Sorry,
I'm back.
I'm back.

73
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.910
Dogs.
Crazy man.
Dog.
Dog is awesome.

74
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.760
But uh,
she's only awesome till like seven people on everybody else.

75
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.060
Look at right now.
She's sitting in the bed or bed with their ears up.

76
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.550
You know what I mean?
Listening intently.

77
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.240
Totally locked in that Terry,
your gene,

78
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.220
cleo still not looking.
Let's see a lot.
I have to say her name.
Cleo.

79
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.800
Cleo,
Cleo.
There we go.
Relax.

80
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.200
<v 1>Okay,</v>

81
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.110
<v 0>stand down.
Um,</v>

82
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.250
anyways,
I like how he said I want to go in there,

83
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.430
I want to go into Indianapolis and I want to sit there and you know,

84
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:52.110
fucking sausage kig cause I watched athletes play at a professional level.
No,

85
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:56.160
I was saying I want to,
uh,
I want to,
I wanted to see the patriots,
you know,

86
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.110
go in and play the colts at full fucking strength if we go on next week.
Okay.

87
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:05.040
And if we win,
God willing,
you know,
Andrew Luck's not 100%,

88
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.710
so I'm not going to gloat about that when I hate when fucking people do that

89
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:12.260
shit.
You know what I mean?
So,
uh,
but what a lot of leak,

90
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.350
there was so many games,
those one o'clock games and I just thought were,

91
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:19.560
were over,
you know,
all right.
Browns are getting their ass kicked.

92
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:23.550
Seattle's killing fucking Cincinnati.
There was one other one in there.

93
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.500
Um,
Cincinnati came back,
the browns came back.

94
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.010
Who else came back?
There was like three fucking games in the beginning.
Ah,

95
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.520
Christ,
I can't,
all the bills,
the bills ended up coming back to,

96
00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:42.150
I was watching that game.
Um,
you know,
tightens a young,

97
00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:46.110
they don't not have close out a team yet,
but,
uh,
I'm always watching Rex Ryan.

98
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.020
Man,
I liked the way that guy coaches,
and it's funny to see him lose.

99
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.520
Nobody takes off a fucking headset when he loses.
Like Kim,

100
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:55.630
he's always good for a couple of courtesies.
Fucking shitty tests,

101
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.220
test the thing off.
But um,
yeah,
so anyways,

102
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.770
I actually totally got off track.
So I was talking about like,

103
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:05.780
I literally think that,
uh,

104
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.450
not to make excuses for,
uh,
how dumb I am,

105
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.680
but there I

106
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.870
really think there's something wrong with the way my brain is wired.
The way I,

107
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:21.170
when I visually look at something and try and process it.

108
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.260
And this fucking flyer it had,
it didn't have,
uh,
you know,

109
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:31.130
the thing was the show was down at the shrine auditorium or something like that,

110
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:34.600
which I found out led Zepplin actually played at.
Um,

111
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.290
I was not in that theater,
obviously
that is in the,

112
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.590
I was at basically the hallway area that led to the arena that,

113
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:49.430
uh,
the theater I should say,
that,
um,
that zipline played in.
And,
um,

114
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.911
anyways,

115
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:54.820
but I noticed the flyer and completely fucked me up because at the,

116
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.610
there was shows from basically like three in the afternoon to 12 midnight.

117
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.410
So when they listed the shows,

118
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:04.910
for some reason they started at 12 midnight and they went backwards.

119
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.360
And then the block that I was in was basically Largo comics with um,

120
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.730
Veruca salts.
Band was actually the band that you got to play with,

121
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:20.690
which is fucking awesome.
Right?
And just the way they had it,

122
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.670
like instead of going down,
you know,
I can't even explain it.
I mean,

123
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:29.540
once you go fucking like five,
six,
seven,
eight,
you wouldn't go 1211.
Right.

124
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.450
But if I had any sort of like learning visual,
a billability,

125
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.890
I would've just looked at it like,

126
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.710
I just look at something like that and I just go like this.

127
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.240
When I see all of that shit,
it just,
my brain just goes like,
ah,

128
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:48.800
I can't even fucking see it totally turns my brain to mush.

129
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.840
And all I saw was Largo.

130
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.300
So my dumb ass drives to Largo.

131
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.670
Now obviously most of you don't live out here.

132
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:03.671
So Largo is basically without traffic is about 20,

133
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:08.780
25 minutes away from the shrine auditorium.
So there's always traffic here.

134
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:12.500
So it was a colossal fuck up on my part.

135
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.450
And um,
and of course I didn't bring the,

136
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.090
I had the parking passes in the wristband,

137
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.740
I had all of that laid out ready to go and my brain kept saying for days and

138
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:27.890
days and days,
go and make sure you have that,
make sure you have that.

139
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.340
And as I was getting ready to leave,
I saw it on the desk.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

140
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:35.930
that thing,
that thing.
And then I fucking go and get my keys and,

141
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:38.480
and I walk out the door without the parking pass,

142
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.020
without the wristband driving to Largo,

143
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.320
the exact opposite direction when I'm supposed to go to the other fucking place.

144
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:49.700
It was a,
a,
an absolute shit show.
And I really,
on the way over,

145
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.980
um,
I can't bring myself to say,

146
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.000
because I've always said that it's just an excuse,

147
00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:01.060
but I would just say there's something fucked up with the way my brain is wired.

148
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.030
Cause my whole life it's just like I,
it's like I don't think I'm dumb,

149
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:10.410
but I continued to do dumb shit.
So the end of the day,
right,

150
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.830
it's the results that's like say I'm a good quarterback but I keep losing the

151
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.680
game.
Right?
So at the end of the day,
yeah,
you suck as a quarterback.

152
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.690
So I would love to hear,
you know,
considering I'm not a doctor,
obviously,

153
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.670
obviously I'd like to hear your guys' analysis cause that's what this whole

154
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:28.260
fucking Internet thing is about.

155
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.290
The Internet is about people who have absolutely zero qualification,

156
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.580
just Shiming in what their opinion just going on and fuck this,

157
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:43.190
what this podcast is.
I'm looked up any of that.
I don't fucking know anything.

158
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:45.440
Right?
So when he was,
so I drive over to the,
um,

159
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.210
the venue and uh,
it's fucking gigantic place.

160
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:51.800
It's one of those places they bring into it.

161
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:53.810
You don't even know what it looks like.
It's so fucking big.

162
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.350
I came in from like the parking structure and uh,

163
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.430
I get in and I'm walking by and as the open area that I'm going to be on that

164
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.890
stage.
And then I walk by and then I go by the theater.

165
00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:11.330
Then evidently led Zeppelin played at,
and a Reggie watts is on stage.

166
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:14.390
Of course crushing it.
I went upstairs,

167
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.820
I met the people in the band and then they basically just fucking ran through if

168
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:20.481
you want blood.

169
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:23.810
And I sat there air drumming and that's one of those songs that fades out.

170
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.240
So the big thing was like,
all right,
how the fuck are we going to end this song?

171
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.300
Um,
and then we're like,
all right,
let's do it.

172
00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:31.040
So then when I came back downstairs,

173
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.590
I'm walking by that it was this weird thing where you walked behind the theater

174
00:10:36.591 --> 00:10:39.220
where the guy was on state.
I can't even explain it.
Yeah.

175
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

176
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.260
<v 0>I can't even explain it.
So this time when I go down,</v>

177
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.670
Reggie is finishing up.
I walk in,

178
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.970
go on into this hall fucking area.
And then we're in the,

179
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.920
the basically the giant open area that looks,

180
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.180
it looks like a giant mall after the apocalypse.
There was an upper deck,

181
00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:01.710
but there was no stores and it wasn't really well lit.
And,

182
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:06.510
um,
so anyways,
the show starts Greg Behr and Kilz tick the towers killing.

183
00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:08.700
So I'm thinking everybody's killing.
I gotta get my shit together.

184
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:13.350
So when I walked into the other area,
um,
to get my head together,

185
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.710
um,
I looked in super,

186
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:21.711
Dave Osborne was on stage where Reggie was just on stage and for guys my age and

187
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:27.840
older,
you remember him from that show.
Bizarre.
And I'm definitely going to work.

188
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.420
I got to put up some clips,
hopefully I'll fucking remember.

189
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.690
I would say I haven't to put up some clips and then I taught for another 50

190
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:37.260
minutes.
I forget it.
But uh,
he was on stage and um,

191
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.940
I would've loved to have met that guy.

192
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.080
That guy used to fucking kill me when I was a kid.
And,
um,

193
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.370
but anyways,
Jesus,
Bill,
get to the fucking point here.
So I go on stage,

194
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.650
I do my thing and I'm

195
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.790
a tell my jokes or whatever and now I'm to go back and go play the fucking
drums.

196
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:56.680
You know,
when you sit down on somebody else's kid,

197
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.420
it's like driving somebody else's car.

198
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.610
The chairs either to fucking closest stairwell,

199
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.970
not the high hat and all that stuff.
So I sit down,
we start fucking playing.

200
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.380
I fuck it up from the very beginning.
Uh,
not in a bad way.
I'm just,

201
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.310
I'm just not playing it the way it is on the album.

202
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:14.710
And I can see the guitar play looking at me like,
dude,
what the fuck?

203
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.090
He didn't do that upstairs.
So I continued doing the same mistake but on time.

204
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:22.120
So you know,
nobody fucking notices.
But he's looking at me like,
wow,

205
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.610
is this going to be a train wreck?
There were,
at least I felt he was,

206
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.200
it's probably my own insecurity.

207
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.740
And then we start to play and I can't hear anything.

208
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.990
I couldn't even hear the bass drum.
And it was like,
wow,
this is,

209
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:38.110
I didn't realize that musicians have to deal with this shit.

210
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:38.921
So it was Kinda cool.

211
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:43.921
So I'm literally can almost hear one of the guitarists and I'm watching his foot

212
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:47.380
and I just started humming the song in my head.

213
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.220
I'm just doing that.
It's grim and know then as humans do what?

214
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:58.120
I'm just back there humming this fucking song.
But it was great.

215
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:00.460
They kept turning around looking at me when we were going into the verse.

216
00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:03.760
So it ended up going,
uh,
going great.

217
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:08.290
But the highlight of it other than getting to play with for Lucas Salt,

218
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:13.000
which is the fucking shit,
um,
they totally rocked the whole fucking night.
Right.

219
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.480
I was a at one point I looked up at the crowd cause that was one of my goals.

220
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.050
Just like with stand up.

221
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:22.540
Like I had to be like I'm taking the Mick out of the mic,
stand on baby,

222
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:26.140
step in this thing with every once in a while playing out playing drums.
Right.

223
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.870
I actually was trying to look up at the crowd more.

224
00:13:28.871 --> 00:13:31.780
So at one point I'm looking up to the crowd is I'm humming the song cause I

225
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:34.960
can't,
I can barely hear people.
Um,

226
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.000
I saw this woman in the crowd and she was standing there.

227
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.000
She wasn't moving at all,
wasn't tapping your toes,

228
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:46.120
wasn't fucking nodding her head,
nothing.

229
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.140
And she had this blank stare and,
but she wasn't looking at anybody.

230
00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:53.140
She was just sort of daydreaming,
standing right in the front.

231
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:58.290
She was like the poster child for like being completely disconnected to anything

232
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:01.990
that was going on stage.
And when I saw her,

233
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.360
the old me that would've crushed me because I was so self conscious about my

234
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:10.030
playing.
But when I saw her,
I actually looked down.

235
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.280
I just looked down and I started laughing.
And,
uh,

236
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.170
I didn't think about it until I was driving away.

237
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:19.180
When I was critiquing the shit out of everything I did,

238
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:22.660
I was actually driving away and I took that.
That was my victory on that one,

239
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.880
was that,
uh,

240
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.710
she clearly was not into it and it didn't rattle me.

241
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:32.530
It actually made me laugh and I was able to find the humor in that.

242
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:37.120
And I was talking to another comic about it and I,
I feel like,
uh,

243
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.430
that's the difference between a performer that stays doing it.

244
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.980
And somebody who just after a while just quits.

245
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.970
And I'm not saying one person is better than another,

246
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.820
but in order to fucking do any sort performing,

247
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.570
<v 2>you have to find the humor in bombing or you're fucked.</v>

248
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:59.830
You have to be able to look at somebody is you're trying,
you're fucking hardest.

249
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.350
And they're just sitting there like,
I mean,
dude,

250
00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:05.740
she was thinking about next Wednesday or some shit or something from our

251
00:15:05.741 --> 00:15:09.850
childhood,
like she was that far
the day.

252
00:15:09.851 --> 00:15:11.740
Jayman it was fucking brutal.

253
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.650
And you've gotta be able to look at that and just be like,
what I'm doing,
right.

254
00:15:16.651 --> 00:15:16.740
Yeah.

255
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.950
<v 0>Now made her do that.
You know,</v>

256
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.140
like that's how bad I am right now.

257
00:15:23.141 --> 00:15:27.010
So whatever I was able to shake it off,
you know,
it's,

258
00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:31.450
hopefully the cowboys will be able to shake off today's loss right there.

259
00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:36.310
Did I bring it back?
Speaking of losing,
uh,

260
00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:40.960
my Boston Bruins,
my beloved,
hey,
we go bro.
It's,

261
00:15:40.961 --> 00:15:42.760
here we go.
Our,
um,

262
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.250
they're all in too now we,

263
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.580
we got shellacked by Winnipeg.

264
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:54.170
We played good for a period and a half,
you know,
but then again,
you know,

265
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:57.470
the game is three periods,
but whatever,
it's a brand new fucking team.

266
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.550
We got rid of everybody.
They got to figure out how they're going to Joe.
Right.

267
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.870
So I'm not freaking out yet and I don't have any,
you know,

268
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.710
ridiculous expectations,
especially,
uh,
uh,

269
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.180
our coach Clo,
Julian and I already had one guy go after we lost a Montreal.

270
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:19.420
He goes,
you know,
they,
uh,
is it time to shorten up the leash,
Upload Julian?

271
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.950
It's like,
why?
Why would you do that?
Does he suddenly not?
No,
no.

272
00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:25.420
Understand the game of hockey.

273
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.600
Why would you blame the fact that they're all in to,
on him?

274
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:34.350
This guy coached the team when he had the players to winning a fucking Stanley

275
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.660
Cup.
That was only four years ago.
It's not like it was 40 years ago.

276
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.320
The game hasn't passed.
The dude.
Bye.
Okay.

277
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.970
In that time we lost Tyler Sagan,
Johnny boy chuck.

278
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.090
Okay.
Douggie Hamilton and Lou cheats the face of our franchise.

279
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:57.920
It's a whole new fucking team.
When he had those guys.
I'm also those guys.
Doug,

280
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.680
he was on the 2011 team yet.
I can't remember.
He won a cup.

281
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.740
So I don't think,
you know,

282
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.680
if you're going to bitch when they're trying to Redo the whole fucking team

283
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:12.410
after two losses,
if you got to bitch about anybody,

284
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.900
you got to bitch about our new GM,
dawn Sweeney.
That's the guy who should take,

285
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:21.140
be taken the heat,
not the fucking coach,
you know,
would say shit like that.

286
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:22.190
Dan Shaughnessy,

287
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.960
Dan Shaughnessy would say shit like that because the man doesn't watch hockey.

288
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.670
So anyways,
I actually saw a lot of positives in the,
um,
uh,
yet another loss,

289
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.410
um,
to the Canadians to hate it.
Canadians,
um,
so many new,

290
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.040
I mean I didn't get to watch the Winnipeg game,
but Joe Barton,

291
00:17:41.041 --> 00:17:46.041
nick from puck off podcast told me that a Winnipeg is a force and that there is

292
00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:49.180
no fucking shame in losing to them.
Then,
you know,
they're loaded,

293
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.140
which is fucking annoying to me.
It's like,
well,
how are they loaded?

294
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.910
How are they under the salary cap?
And they're fucking loaded.
I don't know,

295
00:17:54.911 --> 00:17:57.480
just how to think.
But he got more money than us.
They're in fucking Winnipeg.

296
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.730
I've been to Winnipeg.
All right.

297
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.700
I don't know what the fuck you do out there,

298
00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:05.730
but somehow they got more money than us.
Why?

299
00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.820
Cause they're always digging a new fucking canal for a mall because it's too

300
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:12.420
cold to be outside.
Maybe.
Is that what it is?
I don't fucking know.
But anyways,

301
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:17.220
I saw some,
uh,
I saw some positive shit.
Jesus Christ.

302
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.780
We had like seven penalties and to all you Canadian fans out there,

303
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:24.180
I'll admit we were guilty of all of them.

304
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.930
I didn't have a problem with any of the calls.
Uh,

305
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.740
even the five minute one that spoke to took right the game,

306
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:33.450
the game misconduct.
Uh,

307
00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.360
I didn't have a problem with any of those carry price looked fucking great.

308
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.350
And uh,
but you know,
other than the first penalty kill,

309
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:44.430
which we looked like a beer league team,
um,
you know,
we killed off all those,

310
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:47.490
including the five minute major at one point.
We would when,
uh,
what's his face?

311
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:52.170
Uh,
um,
good Lord.
Bill,

312
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.380
what is wrong with your brain right now?
Brian Marshawn.
Jesus Christ.

313
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.930
He took a penalty.
We actually had a five on three.

314
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.210
They had a five on three for a minute.
We still killed that.

315
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.580
We had a goal called back.
I didn't have a problem with that either.

316
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.330
We will literally laying on the dude's mask,
but uh,
I don't know.

317
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:10.340
I think we were bad.
We will competitive.
I'll give us that.

318
00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:15.300
So I'm sticking it out.
I'm watching every game.
We got Tampa Bay next.

319
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:18.720
We'll probably lose to that one.
You know,
I dunno

320
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.911
is Bart.

321
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:24.840
Nick told me we got to beat the bad teams and fucking hang in there and a,

322
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:26.700
who knows.
We've gotten rid of everybody.

323
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:31.020
I got to think that we have some salary cap,
uh,

324
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.050
money leftover that maybe we can pick somebody up or something.

325
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.580
I don't fucking know.
I don't know what they're doing,

326
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:38.820
but don't blame the fucking coach for the love of God.

327
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:42.510
We don't even have shower showers out right now.
Um,
but I liked that number.

328
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:46.620
39 kids though.
We got from the ducks that uh,
how do you say his name?

329
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:51.570
Matt Boleski or whatever he looks good.
Pasta knock is going to be great.

330
00:19:51.571 --> 00:19:56.130
I think,
I know we got some shit.
Get some shit right Craig.
He's healthy.

331
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.350
Gray,
G,
Patrice Bergeron.
You know,
I think it will be okay.

332
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.660
Um,
whatever.

333
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.180
I'm not gonna be one of those guys that fucking bitch moans and complains there.

334
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:10.170
Right?
We did.
We did fine.
Did find those tours to games.

335
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:12.060
I'm still gonna Watch him.
You know,
it was,

336
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:14.490
if they keep playing the way that they're playing,
I'm,
I'm all right with it.

337
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.443
I can handle that.

338
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:20.130
As long as whatever dawn Sweeney is doing is leading towards the light.

339
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.323
You know,

340
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.940
actually my Sean took a fucking elbow to the head of the end of the game.

341
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:28.170
I think he's got a concussion that's brutal.
One of our best fucking guys.
Right?

342
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.170
And uh,
I don't think it was deliberate.
You never know.

343
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.470
But I just think the guy was so much taller than him.

344
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.530
He was just trying to do the contact thing.
Um,
you see this people,

345
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.220
this is like actually seeing both sides of it.
I did that with the Patriots.

346
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.170
I'm doing it with the Bruins.
Right.
I became a model sports fan right now.

347
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.960
You liked,
you probably don't because it's probably not as funny.

348
00:20:48.961 --> 00:20:51.080
You really brought me to fucking go off and some shit.
Is that,
what,

349
00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.840
is that what you want?
I'll tell you what I'm going to go off on.
Like I actually,

350
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.810
uh,
I felt bad for Mcdonald's.

351
00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.590
<v 0>You know,
first of all,</v>

353
00:21:00.591 --> 00:21:03.440
this whole excitement that to trying to create about the fact that they're

354
00:21:03.441 --> 00:21:07.430
serving breakfast all day.
I mean I might be out of the loop,
you know,

355
00:21:07.431 --> 00:21:11.900
I'm an older fellow,
but nobody I know,
I know is,
has ever bitched at Mcdonald's,

356
00:21:11.901 --> 00:21:14.210
doesn't serve breakfast all day.
They might bitch,

357
00:21:14.211 --> 00:21:18.590
you know when you show up at 10 31,
are you still serving breakfast?
No,
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:18.591 --> 00:21:18.891
You know,

359
00:21:18.891 --> 00:21:21.920
and you've got a hangover and you just want one of their fucking sausage,

360
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.070
egg and cheese and now you've got to get like a quarter pounder.

361
00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.430
You know something about the eggs,
you know,
you did.

362
00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:30.650
I got to eat some eggs and ham,
a little bit of biscuit.
Right.

363
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.810
I could see that and I could see them,
hey,
from now,

364
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.670
now on we're going to be serving a breakfast until 11:00 AM.

365
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.750
That would have been fine.

366
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.690
But to watch these guys just cave in to their fan base and just say,

367
00:21:45.931 --> 00:21:48.800
you know what?
Okay,
you know what you guys,
you win,
you win.

368
00:21:48.801 --> 00:21:51.540
You can have breakfast all day long to watch them do that.

369
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.320
It's like watching a great artist just completely sell out.
Right.

370
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:57.783
And just start,
you know,

371
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.910
making songs that really meant something and connected with the to just do it.

372
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.460
Remember at the time of Bryan Adams put on the eyeliner and spiked up his

373
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:07.780
fucking hair and just like how it,

374
00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:11.050
how did the summer is 69 guy go from this to that and well,
what happened?

375
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.980
This was Mcdonald's is doing right now.

376
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:18.220
They got their eyeliner on and they got their fucking hair all spiked up.

377
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.750
They might as well,
it's just,
you know,

378
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:23.050
when they announced that they fucking going to do breakfast all day,

379
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:26.990
they might as well have had Ronald McDonald behind two turntables.

380
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.170
Pretended to be like a DJ.
You know,

381
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.080
have a little self esteem.
Mcdonald's.

382
00:22:34.081 --> 00:22:37.050
Don't fucking give it to these fucking animals.
Fuck Damn.

383
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.820
If you can't roll your fat ass out of bed by 10 or 10 30,
you get an a burger.

384
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.070
All right?
Fuck you.

385
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.830
<v 0>Gotta make eggs for your all God damn day.
I'm not fucking burgers like 99 cents.</v>

387
00:22:49.831 --> 00:22:51.480
What more could we be doing for you?

388
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:52.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.010
<v 0>Could we do it for you?
What more could we be doing for you?
See that?</v>

390
00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.600
That said fucking hiccup in my brain.
Um,
I think it's a bad move.

391
00:23:00.601 --> 00:23:04.110
You don't see Wendy's doing that.
Wendy's does even serve breakfast.
They're like,

392
00:23:04.111 --> 00:23:08.700
fuck you.
We make hamburgers and you know what?
This square deal with it.

393
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.950
Right?
Mcdonald's,
you're the dealer.
You're the pusher.

394
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.960
Okay?
You let the junkies come to you.
You don't start slashing prices.

395
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.900
Okay?
I ain't just the cake.
You,

396
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.920
you fucking billions and billions of served the formula fucking worst.

397
00:23:26.631 --> 00:23:31.230
What are they so afraid of?
Yeah,
because I'll tell you right now,

398
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.490
you know what sucks Denny's.
Let's just talk breakfast food right here.

399
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.990
You know Danny's fucking blows.
I don't know what it is about them.
They are like,

400
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:45.090
like I hop is like the Iroc CE in Denny's is just the,
the,

401
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.560
you got a Camaro but it's got a v six in it.

402
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.680
I don't know why they serve the exact same.
The exact same film.

403
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.030
Have the same menu.
They just call it different shit.
Right?

404
00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.320
It's like Mcdonald's and Mcdonald's.
Right,
but there's some bad,
I hop,

405
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:05.050
you know the,
the,
the pancakes.
Fluffier Bacon's a little more crispier.

406
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.560
I liked it.
Toasts better.
You know,
eggs are eggs,
whatever,

407
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.540
you know,
don't ever awarded scrambled eggs.
Do you want scrambled eggs?

408
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:18.080
You make them yourself.
Okay.
They just,

409
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.120
nobody knows how to make fucking scrambled eggs.

410
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.520
Nobody knows how to make oatmeal.
They know how to make oatmeal,

411
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:25.340
but they made it like nine hours ago and they just stick it in a giant Vat.

412
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.630
I'll give you guys a great tip on fucking when you make scrambled eggs.

413
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.000
All right?
When you scramble them,
you've got to scramble the shit out of him.

414
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.920
All right.
When I scramble eggs,
all right.
Put two or three in the bull.
Okay.

415
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:44.420
It's like a cooking show,
except he listened to it.
Right.
Um,
you fucking,

416
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.130
you know how the hell I even got on the subject.
How the fuck does this happen?

417
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.550
I'm telling you guys how to scramble eggs.

418
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.860
You realize how insulted you should be right now.

419
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.390
This is like something you'd tell a five year old.

420
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.150
But this is a little secret that I made scrambled eggs forever.

421
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.440
And you know what?

422
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.400
They tasted like the scrambled eggs at Denny's and I was proud.
I was like,

423
00:25:01.401 --> 00:25:04.190
these are just like the ones that Denny's but I didn't realize that daddy's

424
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:06.800
absolutely sucked.
Right.

425
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.230
So,
um,
I'm just loving all the tweets I'm going to get.
Cause you know,

426
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:14.630
there's people out there that love Denny's and thinks ihops stinks.

427
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.930
I will tell you this.
Denny's tables not as sticky.

428
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.170
I hop has cornered the fucking market.
I mean to you,

429
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:24.110
put your elbow on that table.
If you leave it there for more than three seconds.

430
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:28.340
I mean somebody's got to get a putty knife for you not getting it off there.
Um,

431
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.120
so anyways,
the,
the,
the scrambled eggs,
this is what you want to do,
right?

432
00:25:32.121 --> 00:25:36.110
You put two or three in a bull,
whatever you want to fucking do.
All right?

433
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.290
And then you take out your fork and you start fucking scrambling them.

434
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.680
And what a lot of people do is they scramble them for like fucking,
you know,

435
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:45.950
1520 seconds tops.
You don't want to do that too.

436
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.540
Do you want to scramble them for like two minutes?

437
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.700
You want to get a bunch of air in there?

438
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.640
You want to scramble the shit out of him,
right?

439
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.330
I'm on a submarine and article on James Cotton one time he gave me this tip.

440
00:25:56.331 --> 00:25:58.610
So this is from him.
So if you think I'm a fucking moron,

441
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.110
I'm going from a guy who was in godfather one and two.
All right?

442
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.003
And Elf,

443
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.880
three of the greatest fucking movies of all time as far as I'm concerned.

444
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.460
All right.
So anyways,

445
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.490
you've got to get that air in that you've got to have those bubbles going right

446
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:15.680
over the top.
You know what I mean?
Like a good milkshake.

447
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:19.310
That's what the fuck it should look like.
Meanwhile,
you got shipped Pan,

448
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.660
your pan is on.
Hi.
I know you guys Christ.

449
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:25.700
You got to cook the shit out of it.

450
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.080
Now she going to do is the second you pour it and you're going to be constantly

451
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:33.520
moving that motherfucker,
right?
You put it in right,
you got the Pan,

452
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.730
you've got your little fucking,
whatever you use,
right,
you olive oil,

453
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:38.600
whatever the fuck you,

454
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:41.000
I wouldn't put butter in there because you've got it on high,
right?

455
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:43.380
Whatever you spray in there,
you pay him,
whatever you,

456
00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.990
whatever you use to deplete the ozone layer.
You get that thing on high,

457
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.190
right and right is whatever you put in their chest starts to seem like it's

458
00:26:51.191 --> 00:26:54.520
going to start smoking.
You pour that shit in there and it goes

459
00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.240
and then you move that fucker around like a stir fry.

460
00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.680
You don't stop moving that thing.

461
00:26:59.681 --> 00:27:03.620
Right and when it looks like it's about halfway done,
you pull the yeah,

462
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.830
pan off the burner and you finish it that way.
Then you take it,

463
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:10.320
you fucking dump it on and you're done.
That's it.
That was some point.

464
00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:13.110
You put some sea salt in there too.
What?
However,
however you want to garnish it.

465
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.430
All right.
And I'm telling you that there'll be nice and fluffy.

466
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:22.170
All right.
Unlike that horse shit that they have down there at Denny's and IOP.

467
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.670
IOP doesn't make good scrambled eggs either.

468
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:26.160
And then you've got to get cheese in them.
You've got to get cheese.

469
00:27:26.161 --> 00:27:29.010
But that's like ordering a steak and you got to put like fucking a one on it

470
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:30.310
because the guy didn't know how to cook it.

471
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.810
You should not have to put cheese in your fucking scrambled eggs if you know

472
00:27:33.811 --> 00:27:37.680
what you're doing.
All right.
And you know what?
That's one to grow on.
They go,

473
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:40.320
how was that?
It took me fucking seven,

474
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:43.300
eight years of doing this podcast and I finally told you how to scramble a God

475
00:27:43.301 --> 00:27:47.250
Damn Egg.
Um,
actually,
you know something,

476
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:50.250
the cooking it on high part and then taken it off.
I learned that from Nia.

477
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.740
She taught me that thing.
Jesus Christ,

478
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:55.320
we're already fucking halfway through this thing.
Let me,
uh,

479
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.480
let me do some of the reeds here for this week.
Had to scramble an egg point.

480
00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:04.470
A fucking asshole.
Jesus,
that must,
maybe you should really,

481
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:05.970
you should really be fucking offended.

482
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.540
He should be at fender right now cause I'm not really even apologizing to you.

483
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:12.390
I'm just killing time while I try and find where the fuck I put the advertising.

484
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.040
Oh,

Why are you torturing yourself with a gross old blade week after week?

488
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:28.370
Probably because you don't want to shell out 20 bucks for a pack of new ones.

496
00:28:55.011 --> 00:28:58.490
they're trying to fool you into milking the same blade for an entire month.

497
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.360
And that's gross.

You got your balls in the paints.

517
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:13.230
It's almost like they are sweaty except that purple by some fucking me undies.

518
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:17.830
Yeah.
Okay.
We all know how sexy confidence can be.
Oh my God.

519
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:22.150
He just feels like he knows six and that confidence comes from being
comfortable,

520
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.750
but how great can you feel if your underwear is wrinkled,

521
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.230
wrinkling and writing up the undies gets it and that's why they've created the

522
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:32.560
world's most comfortable underwear for a daily dose of confidence.

523
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.000
When you look good,
you feel great.
It's a cliche because it's true me.

524
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.610
Andy's understands this and that's why they designed underwear that makes you

525
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:43.000
feel and look great.
Look and feel fantastic.
Sorry.

00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:44.530

One more legal zoom,

544
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:45.463
everybody.

545
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:51.130
You shouldn't have to choose a random lawyer who charges expensive hourly rates

546
00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:53.200
when you need legal help,
but the legal zoom,

547
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.480
but the legal system is so complicated.

548
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.240
What other choice do you have when you need help with your business?

549
00:31:58.241 --> 00:32:02.170
I want to protect your family.
Relax,
start with legal zoom.

550
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.330
They make it easy for more than a decade.

551
00:32:04.331 --> 00:32:08.080
They've provided a way for regular people like you and me to confidently

552
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:10.590
navigate the legal system.
Legal Zooms,

553
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.840
not a law firm and that's how they provide such a great value.

554
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.990
They don't realize that you,
oh well,
yeah,
we don't even want,
we're doing.

555
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.630
They don't rely on charging you by the hour.

556
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:23.830
Instead you'll get transparent pricing and customer reviews so you know exactly

557
00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:28.030
what you're getting upfront.
If you need help with and corporations,
LLCs,

558
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:31.960
trademarks,
last wills,
living trusts and more legal zooms.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.730
Why do I do that to myself?
Oh,
by the way,

572
00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:21.560
somebody sent me a link to some fucking music and I listened to a couple of

573
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:24.710
their songs,
but I really liked him.
I don't know how to say the name of the band.

574
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:30.670
It's Geo j I are a Gojira go Jarrod.

575
00:33:30.851 --> 00:33:35.510
The Ohana.
I have no idea.
It's the name of the album is from Mars to Sirius.

576
00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.320
And uh,
I usually don't like that music.

577
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:42.560
Would the people sing like [inaudible] wrote that death metal shit.

578
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.000
But these fucking guys,
ladies,
men and women,
I don't where the fuck they are.

579
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.380
They sound like they're a bunch of guys.
Um,
yeah,
blew me away.

580
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:55.700
The song did anyways.
It's called the heaviest matter of the universe.
Um,

581
00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:00.820
I downloaded the album,
came out in 2006 so I'm a little late to the party.
Yeah.

582
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.890
But I'm,
I want to thank whoever sent me that,
um,

583
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.070

584
00:34:07.071 --> 00:34:11.450
and downloaded the entire freaking album over there.

That doesn't mean you need to come over here.

Lay down.

592
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.870
You Go,
you got your own fucking couch.

593
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.250
How much more could you be spoiled in order to is,
was today.

594
00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:42.800
I watched like the whole,
I watched the bills game,

595
00:34:42.801 --> 00:34:45.410
the browns and the Bengals game.
I was just clicking around.

596
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.030
We'll a little bit of the packers too.

597
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.110
And I had the whole house to myself and I was just laying on the couch and she

598
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:54.590
was up on the couch with me laying there like a fucking baby.

599
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.770
So now she wants the whole day like that,
you know what I mean?

600
00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.310
She's a spoiled Brat.
Had you guys see the latest,
uh,

601
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.050
that fan duel thing where they got Tiki barber and a Ron de Barbara to NFL

602
00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:09.110
players talking about it and I uh,
you know,
uh,
yeah,

603
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.740
just pick out your fucking day pickup,
be cash.
My favorite thing,

604
00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:17.300
there was a guy on there where he,
this guy worked on Wall Street.

605
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:21.620
He's crushing it.
Pilfering from the greatest generation.
Right?

606
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:23.480
They're too dumb to know what's going on at this point.

607
00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:27.050
They don't know what's going on in their portfolios.
Stealing from old people,

608
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.250
stealing from young people license to steal the man is on Wall Street.

609
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.170
There's nobody watching these cons.

610
00:35:33.171 --> 00:35:36.800
Every once in a while they'd throw a celebrity chef in jail to make it look like

611
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.260
they're paying attention.

612
00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:43.300
This guy was on fucking easy street and for some dumb reason,

613
00:35:43.301 --> 00:35:47.440
according to this infomercial,
he just decides

614
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:54.980
to quit his job and try to win $1 million on fanduel.

615
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.420
I love that.
Like you,
you just can't try that on the weekend.

616
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.240
You got to sit there and stare at fucking stats.

617
00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.410
Seven days of fucking whiskey for six days before you make you pick.

618
00:36:06.411 --> 00:36:08.690
So long story short,
the guy goes out,

619
00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:11.570
he's in the infomercial so you know he's not going to lose.
And you know what?

620
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.280
He goes out and he wins.
He wins 1 million bucks.
And you know what he does?

621
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.690
You know what he does?
Fuck head that he is.
You know what he does?
True Romance.

622
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.540
He fucking quits his job.

623
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.440
I'm supposed to believe that this guy that works on Wall Street quit it.
Quit,

624
00:36:27.441 --> 00:36:28.160
quit it.

625
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.160
Quit his fucking six figure job on Wall Street to make $1 million.

626
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.360
I know some of you fucking,
you know,
p odds on Wall Street are going to be like,

627
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.670
Ooh,
you know,
just start here.

628
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.540
I don't give a fuck about you there baby face to whiskers.

629
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.390
I don't give a fuck about you.
All right?
You sociopath,

630
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.350
you're gonna work your way up.

631
00:36:48.351 --> 00:36:52.850
This guy was like my age and he was almost as bald as I am.
All right?

632
00:36:52.851 --> 00:36:56.280
So if he's still on Wall Street,
he's making money.
All right?

633
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.520
And he's got a fucking,
you know a god damn ulcer in his stomach.
Okay,

634
00:37:01.521 --> 00:37:04.040
so I know this guy's making money,
so whatever,
I don't even know.

635
00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:05.840
I don't even know if I can work on some works on Wall Street.

636
00:37:05.841 --> 00:37:07.880
What the fuck do I know?
So anyways,

637
00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:11.120
he says that he quit his job after you made the million.
He quit his job,

638
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:16.370
he quit his job on Wall Street because he won $1 million on fanduel.
What's,

639
00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:17.810
which after taxes?

640
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

641
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.800
<v 0>Is going to be more than 50% tax bracket.</v>

642
00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:27.801
So let's say he gets to keep about 480 85 grand after he's done fucking,

643
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.250
you know,
pain is accounting and all the other bullshit.

644
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.790
You know what I mean by in his fucking wife,
the pink Cadillac or the fur coat.

645
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:40.040
Get it.
I get it.
I take it back and it's so bad,
I think,
right?

646
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.280
Once he's done doing all that right,
he's got like fucking 480 grand.

647
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.740
He quits his fucking job and now he's going to take that foreign 80 grand and

648
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:54.000
reinvest in his new business of gambling on football.

649
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.060
It's fucking guy is going to be homeless.

650
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.120
It's going to be almost with ims on call right now.

651
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:03.000
This guy is going to be destitute and fuck and he's gonna be one of the guys at

652
00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:06.930
Bryant Gumbel interviews or actually one of his piano interviews.

653
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.790
You know what I mean?
He always sends them out.

654
00:38:08.791 --> 00:38:13.560
Brian is not going on in the field anymore.
He's too old for that shit.
You know?

655
00:38:13.561 --> 00:38:16.710
And then you come back and he does his followup where he has his little

656
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:18.600
clipboard,
a questions,
you know,

657
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:21.790
and the person sits down and he comes back and then he just goes like,
oh,
well,

658
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.000
oh,
whatever the fuck.
He says,
you know,

659
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.420
it was really high pitched voice when he's got that little like,
oh,

660
00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:36.100
they're going to interview this fucking guy
and he's going to there.
You

661
00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.760
<v 1>want Brian interview somebody?</v>

662
00:38:37.761 --> 00:38:41.300
And he just thinks that that the dumbest fucking the planet he does.
He does not.

663
00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.140
He waves his emotions,
not on his sleeve.
He wears a right on his fucking face.

664
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.150
I never understood that.
Why?
Why is it your sleep?

665
00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.600
Nobody looks at your sleeve when you're talking.
I don't get what that means.

666
00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.950
I've never understood it.
Nor did I ever look it up considering I got to fucking,

667
00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.020
I got a Goddamn a laptop right here.
Why don't I look it up?

668
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:03.140
Come on window move for me.

669
00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.530

674
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:23.930
<v 0>Hey,</v>

676
00:39:27.581 --> 00:39:32.200

What a fucking great car.
I'm not the biggest fan of low riders,
but uh,

677
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:35.260
those paint jobs are fucking ridiculous.
I think they look cool as shit,

678
00:39:35.261 --> 00:39:39.190
but I'm just,
I like to,
I like going fast more than just fucking cruising around.

679
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:42.490
But uh,
the 78 olds cutlass man is fucking,

680
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.930
those were the cars man when I was a kid man.

they will basically all the same body style body type.

684
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.910
I thought that those were the best silicon and stock cars too,

Dale Earnhardt rest.
His soul used to drive the wrangler,

688
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:20.920
the blue and yellow wrangler.
He get out there and get sideways.
Right.

689
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.010
They all had old,
staid cutlasses.
Monte Carlos,

690
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.820
I think Harry Gant had the fucking uh,

691
00:40:28.821 --> 00:40:33.050

the rear window was just straight,

692
00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.380

just chopped it right down the back six,

693
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.110
we'll fucking bad ass cars man.

694
00:40:39.111 --> 00:40:44.111
Those two door coops with that ridiculous fucking interior,

695
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:49.940
that totally cheesy.
Uh,

696
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.600

So they read did one,

697
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.930
you know what kills me.
The fucking gas monkey season is already over

698
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.220
10 episodes.
How the fuck does it go by that quick?

699
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.830
That was a brutal season for me.

700
00:41:03.831 --> 00:41:08.660
Everybody brutal season went by in fucking two seconds and Casey left the show.

701
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.200
Um,
I dunno,

702
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.360
I wished that they'd let him do more shit like the,

703
00:41:14.361 --> 00:41:17.800
I love when he did the lace top and when he was trying to do the low riders

704
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:20.590
stuff.
Um,
he was talking about how when they do,

705
00:41:20.591 --> 00:41:23.780
they put so many layers of paint on it that it looks like you can actually,

706
00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:25.340
after a while it creates the illusion.

707
00:41:25.341 --> 00:41:27.260
You feel like you can actually reach down into it?

708
00:41:27.261 --> 00:41:31.880
I'll fucking killer is that and just watching how they,
I don't know.

709
00:41:31.881 --> 00:41:35.180
I'm such a fucking respect that and they did so many cool projects this year

710
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:38.000
where they try to do something different.
They did the old catty,

711
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.740
they did a low rider.
They got that Ford Gt.
Um,

712
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:43.900
<v 1>okay.</v>

713
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.150
<v 0>Such a great fucking season and I then,
you know,</v>

714
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.300
I don't know that that shows the best man.
It just went,
went by too fucking fast.

715
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.460
Now what am I going to do?
Right.

716
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:55.630
I had the same level of depression when like a fucking sports season ends.

717
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:56.650
<v 1>Okay,</v>

718
00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:00.340
<v 0>well they like to be there next week for the final episode of this season's gas</v>

719
00:42:00.341 --> 00:42:02.410
monkey garage.
I was like what the fuck are you talking about?

720
00:42:02.411 --> 00:42:06.070
They just started probably cause I binged watched like five of them cause I was

721
00:42:06.071 --> 00:42:09.730
on the road.
Whatever.
What the fuck am I talking about?
Oh,

722
00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.550
wearing your emotions on your sleeve.
Hey guys,
I'm getting better at that.
Huh?

723
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.570
I usually go off on a tangent.

724
00:42:13.571 --> 00:42:17.680
I never come back wearing his,

725
00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.460
well fuck that.
Fuck his or her wearing emotions.

726
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.020
Typing with just my index finger on sleeve

727
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.090
definition.

728
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

729
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.180
<v 0>Meaning no origin.</v>

730
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:38.100
That's what I want the origin origin of wearing your heart on your sleeve.
Oh,

731
00:42:38.101 --> 00:42:42.150
that's how you say,
not your emotions.
Uh,

732
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.990
come on load please.
Advertising.
Oh look at that.

733
00:42:45.991 --> 00:42:50.991
Pretty girl with if she lotions healthy looking skin starts here with user Id.

734
00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.820
Continue our site.
That was it.
I just had a look at her.

735
00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.320
She was nice to look at the origins of wearing your heart on your sleeve.

736
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:02.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

737
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:03.363
<v 0>All right.
Here we go.</v>

738
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.420
It was during the Roman Empire that Saint Valentine is said to have left a note

739
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.400
to his jailers daughter.

740
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

741
00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:12.601
<v 0>Oh Jesus.</v>

742
00:43:12.601 --> 00:43:15.330
How much was she trying to fucking piss off her dad by fucking one of the

743
00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:18.990
inmates.
Huh?
From your Valentine.
Uh,

744
00:43:18.991 --> 00:43:22.380
before his execution on February 14th.
Today.

745
00:43:22.381 --> 00:43:27.270
Thanks to Saint Valentine cards expressing one's heartfelt emotions,

746
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.670
Aka Valentine's,
are given to that special.

747
00:43:29.671 --> 00:43:33.240
Someone to defer to the classic idiom.

748
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.240
It's a day to wear your heart on your sleeve.

749
00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.290
Was there an explanation in there?

750
00:43:40.291 --> 00:43:42.570
You started with a story and then you just deferred,

751
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:44.010
which completely fucked me up.

752
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:47.670
We use the phrase casually to mean exposing our true emotions,

753
00:43:47.671 --> 00:43:50.250
making ourselves vulnerable and letting it all hang out.

754
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.290
The phrase is so pervasive that from Ringo Starr to m and M to carry under word,

755
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.560
those words to turn into the jewelry.

756
00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.220
You're trying to stretch this out any longer.

757
00:43:59.221 --> 00:44:00.960
This could have been one fucking paragraph.

758
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:02.360
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

759
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.430
<v 0>wearing your heart on a sleeve.
Oh,
here we go.</v>

760
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.390
But what kind of sleeve and why?
Honestly,

761
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.020
I swear to God I'm reading the copy and not pants.
Her legs and around your neck.

762
00:44:12.021 --> 00:44:15.080
There's no clear answer.
You fucking Asshole,

763
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.350
but little mini you fucking Dick.

764
00:44:19.351 --> 00:44:21.630
That's why you were stretching it out because if you just wrote,
I don't know,

765
00:44:21.631 --> 00:44:25.770
I wouldn't have clicked on your site.
All right,

766
00:44:25.771 --> 00:44:29.370
we've got to see it through people.
I'm sorry there's no clear answer,

767
00:44:29.371 --> 00:44:34.371
but many legends attempt to to get at the heart of the matter.

768
00:44:35.011 --> 00:44:37.950
Now you're going to go into upon FTE.
Tell me,
this is such a fucking train wreck.

769
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:41.100
I can't stop.
It may explain the sorts of the same.

770
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:43.230
The three most popular are in the Middle Ages.

771
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:48.180
Emperor Claudius to second believed unattached men,
made better soldiers.

772
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:51.300
So he did declared marriage illegal as a concession.

773
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.400
He encouraged temporary coupling once a year during a Roman festival honoring

774
00:44:56.401 --> 00:44:59.400
Juno men drew names to determine who would be there.

775
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:04.401
Lady friend for the coming year once established the man would wear a name on

776
00:45:05.101 --> 00:45:06.900
his sleeve for the rest of the festival.

777
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.640
Jesus Christ to the woman have any say no.

778
00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:15.770
She's just a common who Janet.
Ruthie is.

779
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.370
Uh,

780
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.780
around that same time it's speculated when a night performed in a jousting match

781
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:22.740
in the king's court,

782
00:45:22.741 --> 00:45:27.140
he dedicated his performance to a woman of the court by tying something of hers

783
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.890
like a handkerchief around his arm.

784
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:33.960
He let the court know the match would defend the honor of that woman or we can

785
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:36.600
credit Shakespeare and I'm not reading this Shakespeare,

786
00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.560
you wanna hear me read Shakespeare where May,
okay,
I ago.

787
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.280
It is sure as you are a road road Rodrick Rodera ago where I,

788
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:50.730
the more I would be,
I would not be I ago.

789
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.270
Well,
I'm glad you cleared that up,
Billy.
This is right here.

790
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:58.980
Why I flunked all this shit and following him.
I follow,
but my dude,
fuck you.

791
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.740
Fuck you.
All right.
Jesus Christ.

792
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:04.260
Why don't you Jesus fucking Christ and you're not depressing.

793
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:06.540
That was that fucking attempt right there.

794
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:14.070
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
I succeed in anything,
isn't it?
Oh,
by the way,

795
00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.510
just stay doing this 20 year retrospective on Oj,
the Oj Simpson trial.

796
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.470
It was funny and they said the exact same shit that they said 20 years ago,

797
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.820
how polarizing it was and how white people saw it one way and how black people

798
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:27.654
saw it in another way.

799
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.840
Now obviously I'm not going to be dumb enough to try to speak for black people

800
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:32.790
here.
I wouldn't do that.
But I'll tell you what.

801
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:35.940
There was plenty of black people on that show speaking for white people and you

802
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:37.830
know,
I'm not saying there were 100% wrong,

803
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.510
but they will never speaking for all the sports fans out there who happened to

804
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:46.830
be white like me,
the whole trial.
When I was watching that,
I was never thinking,

805
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:50.760
oh,
that son of a bitch,
black guy killed that pure blonde white woman.

806
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.270
I never thought that shit.
The entire trial.

807
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.330
I've thought the exact same thing.
Anytime I would turn it on,

808
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.250
I would think the exact same thing.
I would be like,
Daddy's fucking Oj Simpson.

809
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:08.780
Oj Simpson is sitting behind that table on trial for a double murder.

810
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:13.860
I grew up watching that guy.
You know,
when he did the heart's commercials,

811
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:14.611
I was just,

812
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:19.140
I was like five or six years old and that old lady Gow Gow right when he would

813
00:47:19.141 --> 00:47:20.520
fucking jump over the luggage.

814
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:24.030
I wasn't old enough to know that a black guy starring in a fucking commercial

815
00:47:24.031 --> 00:47:26.940
like that was groundbreaking.
I didn't,

816
00:47:26.941 --> 00:47:30.280
I just knew that that guy was fucking awesome.
He had a cool nickname.

817
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.240
My first pack of football cards,
I got Cleo for the love of fucking Christ.

818
00:47:34.241 --> 00:47:38.320
Can you lay down buddy?
All right.
Get up here.
Get up here and there you go.

819
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:42.550
Lay down.
So yeah,
given I give it a go,
just show cubed.

820
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.720
Anyways,
back to Oj.
Um,

821
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.750
my first pack of football cards and it got,
he was right on top,

822
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.550
right on fucking top.
I think the gun was in the back so it didn't ruin it.
And,

823
00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:57.670
um,
that was like my prize possession.

824
00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:01.840
And I remember I was so young when he got traded to the 40 niners and I got that

825
00:48:01.841 --> 00:48:04.960
tops football card that me and my brothers used to call side year because

826
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:08.170
everything was on when we used to trade.
Like what year?
Flag here,
side year,

827
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:12.150
football year.
Um,
rather than the years.
Um,

828
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.050
I thought it was gonna be worth money because he was on a different team.
Like,

829
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:19.330
wow,
this is Oj Simpson's on the 40.

830
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:21.610
Niners this is going to be worth money because people do,
you know,

831
00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:23.680
I didn't realize that the rookie card,
I was young,
I was stupid.

832
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.920
And then I watched his fucking movies,
the naked gun.

833
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.970
I watched him on Monday night football when he was with Joe Nemeth and he would

834
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:33.430
be like,
you don't want to,
I would have done,
but I would have cut back.

835
00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:34.570
He used to say what he would do.

836
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.640
And then Joe Nemeth would always say the same thing.

837
00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:41.200
That was a really nice play play.
He's always say that shit.

838
00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:43.570
And it was a terrible year for Monday night football or whatever.

839
00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.920
I just remember hearing shit that Bob Costas and Al Michaels,
you know,

840
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:50.790
born in contact with them anymore.

841
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:56.390
There was the first time I really remember watching somebody have it all and

842
00:48:56.391 --> 00:48:59.810
then fucking lose it all.
And it was always,

843
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:04.990
that's how I always looked at Oj Simpson's 2003 fucking yards in a season.

844
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.490
Heisman trophy winner,

845
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.230
star of the naked gun one and two and that fucking movie where he was the

846
00:49:12.231 --> 00:49:14.180
astronaut,
right.

847
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.110
And the thing goes bad and then they try to kill him.

848
00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:23.280
That's who the fuck he was in there.
He was just sitting there on track.

849
00:49:23.281 --> 00:49:24.650
I couldn't fucking believe it.

850
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:29.150
So the next time they do one of those documentaries,

851
00:49:29.151 --> 00:49:30.980
they got to have a dope like me in there.

852
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.940
Not going like you know it and the history and the justice system,

853
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.000
black thing will always say the lightbars again.
I'll play with it.
Tell me.

854
00:49:39.001 --> 00:49:42.570
It was,
it was fucking,
it was Oj Simpson.
All right.

855
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:46.920
For you youngsters out there just about who,
who's your guy?
You know what I mean?

856
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.890
Is there even a guy like that anymore?
I don't know.

857
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.460
I can't relate to it anymore because every time I look at an athlete now it's

858
00:49:53.461 --> 00:49:56.480
just somebody half my fucking age live in a dream that never happened to me.

859
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.940
Um,
this is fucking ridiculous.
All right.
Where the fuck are we?

860
00:50:02.941 --> 00:50:05.060
Here?
Let me get to,
well,

861
00:50:05.061 --> 00:50:08.150
let me get to some of the reads for the week here and then I go workout because

862
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.660
I go to the gym.
Um,
I maintain it guys.
I put on a few,

863
00:50:12.661 --> 00:50:13.770
then I take it off,
put on a few,

864
00:50:13.771 --> 00:50:16.980
we'll take it up and I'm still on my fight and fucking weight.
Um,

865
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.900
which I don't even know what the fuck it is.
Anyone,

866
00:50:18.901 --> 00:50:20.400
which is good cause I got active mark tomorrow,

867
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.010
so maybe I'll look sexy and maybe I'll get some more work on it,

868
00:50:23.011 --> 00:50:27.120
but I don't know where the fuck is.
Oh,
did I close the wrong one?

869
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.400
Ah,
is it,

870
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:34.270
could this be like a new segment on the fucking podcast where bill tries to find

871
00:50:34.271 --> 00:50:37.750
the fucking window that he opened and everything was fine and he had it all set

872
00:50:37.751 --> 00:50:41.710
up and then he fucks it up when he's on live.
All right.

873
00:50:41.711 --> 00:50:44.080
Contents,
contents.
Hey,

874
00:50:44.081 --> 00:50:48.040
if you guys want to email the podcast bill@themmpodcast.com.

875
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.200
All right.
Draft kings inside,
inside,
or explanation.
All right,

876
00:50:53.201 --> 00:50:54.040
cause I didn't get a last week.

877
00:50:54.041 --> 00:50:57.640
I don't understand why it was such a big fucking deal that some people from

878
00:50:57.641 --> 00:51:02.470
draftkings one 300 grand at fan duel and they were saying that they had inside

879
00:51:02.471 --> 00:51:03.840
information and sign.
I was like,
what are yeah,

880
00:51:03.841 --> 00:51:05.270
what are your friends will or what are the way?

881
00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:09.170
Have a friend little player though.
Um,
so bill not trying to be a container,

882
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:11.290
just explaining why that guy from draftkings,

883
00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.380
what he did was considered insider information and made money.

884
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.760
Basically he had access to the percentage of ownership of the players.

885
00:51:18.761 --> 00:51:23.050
For example,
he knew that 58% of people were starting Brady.

886
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:27.710
13% were starting.
Russell Wilson,
Wilson,
80% start,
uh,

887
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:31.770
starting Julio Jones,
et Cetera.
Obviously these are not the real percentage.

888
00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.820
It's just an example.
While even if they were,

889
00:51:33.821 --> 00:51:36.370
I wouldn't be able to figure out the math.

890
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:40.150
So thank you for giving me round numbers anyways.

891
00:51:40.151 --> 00:51:42.340
He and all and uh,

892
00:51:42.341 --> 00:51:46.540
only others at draftkings had that information.
Not anyone else.

893
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.690
The general meaning the general public,
um,

894
00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:51.970
that we're playing in those games.

895
00:51:51.971 --> 00:51:54.670
The numbers are released after the lineups are locked,

896
00:51:54.671 --> 00:51:59.110
but he had them beforehand.
Okay.
So I understand that he had information,

897
00:51:59.111 --> 00:52:01.370
but I don't understand what you do do with the information because I don't play

898
00:52:01.371 --> 00:52:02.930
fantasy football or to this shit.

899
00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:06.350
So hopefully you'll break it down a little more.
He and the uh,
um,

900
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.150
player percentage own is potentially the biggest factor when picking players.

901
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:16.250
Why this is,
why is this significant do please don't ask the questions.

902
00:52:16.251 --> 00:52:20.540
Just fucking give me the answers.
Why?
I don't know.
Well,

903
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:24.020
the only way to actually make money and get ahead of other players is if you had

904
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:25.970
different people starting than them.
Right?

905
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:29.240
If 80% of the people are starting Julio Jones and you have him,

906
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.150
you won't get ahead of people,
you will be even with them.
Yeah.

907
00:52:32.151 --> 00:52:34.370
But if Julio has a bigger day,
you're going to be fucked.

908
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.110
So what this country did was look at the players with the lowest percentage

909
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:42.550
owned that also had the highest potential law.

910
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:47.580
They have big Gabes he uses inside information he had at draftkings to play in

911
00:52:47.871 --> 00:52:50.630
big money tournaments at fan duel.
Also,

912
00:52:50.631 --> 00:52:53.870
he wanted big money almost every day playing MLB fantasy.

913
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.230
It's not out of the question to think he could have added information from
shark.

914
00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.830
His buddies are the highest bidder.
Oh,
that's very interesting.

915
00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.410
That's really fascinating.
That's going to be a great movie,
right?

916
00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:08.200
Let's give you an animal is Facebook movies.
You know,

917
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.230
some awkward guys gonna play the awkward guy that started it.
No.
Cool.

918
00:53:11.231 --> 00:53:12.970
Does anybody cool who's fucking,
you know,

919
00:53:12.971 --> 00:53:16.780
can hold up their end of a conversation ever starting think he like a really

920
00:53:16.781 --> 00:53:19.180
introverted thing.
This computer stuff,
it's amazing.

921
00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.020
They can't talk to people yet.
What they make speaks to so many.

922
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.700
Wow.
Sorry.
Uh,

923
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:34.620
there must have been a collective that use on that one.
All right.
Nfl Pink.

924
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.180
Dear Billy Schram.
Uh,
if a guy likes Phil Sims,

925
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:40.380
Jim Nance or Chris Collins,

926
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:45.360
where spoke out about extortion involved in the breast cancer awareness pink

927
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:47.850
campaign,
would they lose their job?

928
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:52.020
Of course if they said it's stupid,
they just lose their job.

929
00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:56.640
But if they articulated the problem with parading survivors on the field at the

930
00:53:56.641 --> 00:53:59.310
beginning of the game,
like during the New England Dallas game,

931
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:02.940
a while only giving pennies on the dollar to the actual cause,

932
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.450
would they come under fire or be praised?
Thanks the guy.

933
00:54:06.451 --> 00:54:09.360
I think I've answered all of those questions.
Um,

934
00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.710
look,
I mean the NFL is always going to sell jerseys.

935
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.140
So they make some pink ones and the pink ones,

936
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:20.800
they give a percent evidently allegedly to a,
the cancer people,
uh,

937
00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.690
the awareness people in,
then they give 8% of that 8% and I fucking works.

938
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:30.450
I mean it's better than not.
Yeah.
I mean,

939
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:35.460
I think the way they presented it,
like a portion of the proceeds fans,

940
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:38.370
all we hear is like,
Oh,
I buy this Jersey and then they give all this money.

941
00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:41.370
You know,
I get a jersey,
it's not the color I wanted,

942
00:54:41.371 --> 00:54:46.260
but that's going to help out people that are suffering.
Um,
so yeah,

943
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:51.060
it's not,
it's not the most transparent advertising gives a fuck.
Right.

944
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.770
They don't give a shit.

945
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:56.160
They didn't give a shit when ray rice fucking knocked out his fiance and he only

946
00:54:56.161 --> 00:54:59.220
gave him two fucking games and they didn't give a fuck until the video came out.

947
00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:02.370
Then they suspended him forever.
They didn't give a fuck.
Why can't,

948
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.210
because ray rice fucking was making him a bunch of money.
It's like,
you know,

949
00:55:06.211 --> 00:55:06.510
they get,

950
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.290
they call it the Brady rule about not hitting low and hitting the quarterback

951
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.460
late.
It's not the Brady rule.
It's the fucking money rule.

952
00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:12.990
They don't give a fuck about Tom Brady.

953
00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:16.260
Tom Brady make some money and Tom Brady's not playing.
They lose money.

954
00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:18.010
So they're like,
we got to protect that motherfucker.

955
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.520
Not because Tom has any sort of influence,

956
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:25.290
although he is pretty dreamy to look at a lifeguard bill.

957
00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:27.570
I'm a lifeguard in a strong swimmer.

958
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:32.340
I was at the beach last week and I noticed the body go under.
Oh my God.

959
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.190
Oh my God,
Dude.
That's one of the scariest fucking,

960
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:36.750
that's one of my biggest fears in life.

961
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:41.010
The undertow was bad that day and I had a bad feeling so I swam to where I

962
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:44.430
thought someone went under.
I pulled up an 11 year old kid.

963
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:47.970
He had water in his lungs and was struggling through this better be true because

964
00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:51.090
I or you better go into writing because I'm a riveted right now.

965
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:54.480
I didn't need to give him give full on CPR,

966
00:55:54.481 --> 00:55:58.200
but I did have to administer the proper response to get them to cough out the

967
00:55:58.201 --> 00:56:02.820
water.
He wasn't small and he wasn't being stupid.

968
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:04.890
That's just the way the ocean is.

969
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:09.150
The next day the newspaper tried to interview me.
I really didn't want to.

970
00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:13.320
Every time someone does something and they're in the paper for it,

971
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:16.800
it feels like a celebration.
It's not someone could have died.

972
00:56:16.801 --> 00:56:20.970
I understand that I may have done something great or you doing the aw shucks

973
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:22.530
thing is it's like a humble brag.

974
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.100
I've been told that I just don't want to celebrate.

975
00:56:25.101 --> 00:56:29.960
The report has said that I was doing a disservice because I was presenting the

976
00:56:29.961 --> 00:56:34.870
story from a being inspiring.
Do they need my soundbite?

977
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.390
Can't,
can't the story be enough?
Am I an asshole?
No,
you're not.

978
00:56:38.391 --> 00:56:41.900
You're not an asshole at all.
Just fuck you.

979
00:56:41.901 --> 00:56:45.170
Do what you do and then fuck them.
Fuck them.

980
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.950
Yeah.
Let them figure out what the fuck happened.
I don't think you are.

981
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.080
I don't think you're being an asshole at all.
Uh,
you know,

982
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:56.350
if you're telling the truth and you're actually actually being honest right now,

983
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.110
you didn't use your name so you're not going to get any praise.

984
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:01.860
I think what you're doing,
I think what you did was great.
Yeah.

985
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.040
I don't need to fucking talk to you.

986
00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:04.580
I don't know if we supposed to talk around about,

987
00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.040
talk about how fucking great you are.

988
00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.640
I saw him go under and I knew if I didn't get out there,

989
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:13.680
if I didn't do something,
nobody would.
Um,

990
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:18.040
no,
I think,
you know,
especially this day and age,

991
00:57:18.041 --> 00:57:20.320
when did you scratch sucking a dick?
Gets you a TV show?

992
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.270
You're actually saved somebody from drowning.
I mean,

993
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:27.930
probably get a fucking mini series
actually.
Is that better than a TV series?

994
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:30.900
Will most TV series don't get picked up?
I don't know.
Actually.

995
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:35.140
Just get a pilot is what you really good.
All right,
Bill,
he'd done.
Yeah,
I'm done.

996
00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.900
All right.
My girlfriend wants to sell her panties online.

997
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.200
How do you not read this?
I know you guys.

998
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:44.230
I didn't give a shit if these are real enough.
These are very entertaining.
Hey,

999
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:47.500
Billy,
beef arts.
Uh,
I moved,

1000
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:50.740
it meets my situation is exactly what it sounds like.
Last week,

1001
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:54.640
my girlfriend of six years asked me if I think it's okay if she sells her used

1002
00:57:54.641 --> 00:57:55.710
panties online.

1003
00:57:55.830 --> 00:58:00.830
Gross to some of those Weirdo fetishes who enjoys that kind of shit.

1004
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:07.330
I said,
sure.
Thinking what's the harm?
Well,

1005
00:58:07.331 --> 00:58:08.800
what if one of those guys is in those?

1006
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.880
There's a forensic expert and that's also his fucking,
you know,

1007
00:58:12.881 --> 00:58:15.010
and that's how he kind of be going.
All those murder scenes.

1008
00:58:15.011 --> 00:58:17.950
He started sniffing panties.
Now he's afraid he's going to get caught.

1009
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:21.010
So we ordered them online and then after a while the smells in enough.

1010
00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:23.770
So he starts dusting the panties for prints and next thing you know we standing

1011
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:28.780
at your door with a fucking meat cleaver and a hard on and you went to the door.

1012
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.620
You know he's got one hammer for one,

1013
00:58:32.621 --> 00:58:34.510
he's got the ax for the other and you show up.

1014
00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:35.800
That's going through your fucking head.

1015
00:58:35.801 --> 00:58:38.020
And then he's looked going and looking for your panty lists.
Girlfriend,

1016
00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:42.220
I think you fucking nuts.
Anyways,
I said,
sure.

1017
00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.730
They can watch the hub where both university students,

1018
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:49.450
she needs money and what's the harm and milking these Wackos for old pantie

1019
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:52.720
stain and clam juice.
Dude,
there's no way you love this woman.

1020
00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:54.760
Here's the problem.

1021
00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:58.780
She tells me that she needs to have pictures taken in these panties to PR to

1022
00:58:58.781 --> 00:59:02.200
prove to her potential clients that she did actually wear them.

1023
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.560
Now she doesn't.
They want to smell them so they see her.

1024
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:08.800
So they got a man fucking rob 'em out.

1025
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:13.630
Um,
when she told me this,
I wasn't really,

1026
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:17.500
it wasn't really in a way that was asking for permission.

1027
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:22.840
Not that I would expect her to,
not that I would expect her to.

1028
00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:27.820
This is how much the these fucking American male has been beaten down.

1029
00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:31.570
Then if they don't let the woman in their life do every fucking thing that she,

1030
00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:36.370
every fucking fucking idea that comes to her head,
if they get in the way of it,

1031
00:59:36.371 --> 00:59:39.350
they're crushing or dream.
How about have you [inaudible] you're a fucking,

1032
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:40.333
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1033
00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:44.190
<v 0>you're not even her boyfriend at this point.
You're just an entourage member.</v>

1034
00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:49.490
Just go,
hey,
where are we going tonight?
Well,
that's cool.
Can you be a fellow?

1035
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.640
Could deal love this woman.
Don't fucking let her do this.

1036
00:59:51.641 --> 00:59:55.420
This is a dumb fucking idea.
Don't you have dumb ideas?

1037
00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:58.420
Doesn't she say to you every once in a while,
hey,
that's a stupid idea.

1038
00:59:58.421 --> 01:00:00.310
And then afterwards you're like,
Jesus Christ.
What was I thinking?

1039
01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.610
Thank God you were in my life.
This is when you need to step up,

1040
01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:08.600
not stand down.
She just,
Ah,
dude,

1041
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.570
if she fucking does it,
she's basically,
she's in the porno industry.

1042
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.880
Her picture's going to be online on a panty sniffer fucking website.

1043
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:24.500
What?
What?
What fucking job you get after that and it lives forever

1044
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.580
and they'll wait.
They'll wait till she's running for office.

1045
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:32.450
You know where she starts her own fucking campaign to stop some fucking disease.

1046
01:00:32.451 --> 01:00:34.460
Right.
Then that thing's going to come out.

1047
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.110
The old patty panty sniffer fucking photo is going to come up anyways.
He says,

1048
01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:43.340
but more of of anyways.
Not that I would expect her to.

1049
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.430
So what if?
What if?
So what have you dabbled into the porn industry?
However the,

1050
01:00:50.431 --> 01:00:54.790
fuck you,
we're going to do it but just a picture.
Huh?
I don't know.

1051
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.390
It's fucking crazy.
Anyways,
but more of a,

1052
01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:59.550
this would be part of the deal kind of way.

1053
01:00:59.551 --> 01:01:01.770
She brought it up to up to me immediately.

1054
01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:05.580
I tell her that I have a huge problem with this.
Well,
all right then.

1055
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:10.560
All right then you scared me there earlier and she should not be doing it.

1056
01:01:10.561 --> 01:01:14.490
She argues that and I quote,
I liked the attention it gets.

1057
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:18.110
All right dude.
You know what?
This is the sound of

1058
01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.760
that is the sound of you backing up the dump truck that she's laying in the back

1059
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:39.230
of and dumping that bitch in the trash.
Dude,
this is not the mother.

1060
01:01:39.231 --> 01:01:43.990
Your kids this God bless her.
I don't know who the fuck fuck they've her up.
It's,

1061
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.833
it's all over

1062
01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.253
<v 1>out.</v>

1063
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.410
<v 0>It's over dude.
It's out and it's done.</v>

1064
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.220
I don't even need to read the rest of this.
He goes like,

1065
01:01:55.221 --> 01:01:56.960
what the fuck am I supposed to do here?

1066
01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:04.920
That's why he is voted to keep my mouth shut and act like a cuckold or f or

1067
01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.960
fight this thing to the bitter end.

1068
01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:09.840
I know it's her body and she has the right to do anything with it.

1069
01:02:09.841 --> 01:02:14.370
Shut the fuck up with that.
Jesus Christ.
He's fucking feminist.

1070
01:02:14.371 --> 01:02:19.260
You guys have turned into zombies.
This is it like a date rape situation.

1071
01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.450
I get,
she does have the right to do it,
but you,

1072
01:02:22.451 --> 01:02:24.470
you stopping him from getting into the porn industry,

1073
01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.070
but it makes me feel like a complete tool.
It should.

1074
01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.770
Any input would be appreciated.
Bill,
I think I told you,

1075
01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.520
I think I told you what you should do to just,
yeah,
you know what?

1076
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:40.060
This is the deal.
Okay?
Even if she goes,
you're good.

1077
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:44.440
<v 5>Break out with it or that.
Forget it.
I won't do it.
I can't live without you.</v>

1078
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:47.250
<v 0>Fuck that.
Whatever.
This is this.
This is a,</v>

1079
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:51.750
this is going to rear its ugly fucking head again.
I liked the attention it gets.

1080
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:57.260
She likes that kind of attention.
Okay?
I'm telling you right now,
dude,

1081
01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:02.750
I'm telling you right now,
somebody that likes that kind of fucking of attention,

1082
01:03:02.751 --> 01:03:07.751
if not the attention that she can get within a fucking one-on-one monogamy

1083
01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.700
monogamous relationship.
All right?

1084
01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:14.440
Now whether she'll ever act on it and go even further,
end up on a pole,

1085
01:03:14.441 --> 01:03:16.070
a blowing somebody behind a dumpster,

1086
01:03:16.071 --> 01:03:20.270
down at a Denny's after she ate some bad scrambled eggs.
Who's the fucking know?

1087
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.600
All you know is that you're rolling the dice with half of your shit.

1088
01:03:23.601 --> 01:03:27.200
If you ever marry this kid,
this kid,
this woman,
and have kids,

1089
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:31.850
you know,
and the kids are going to have to play fucking look like her.

1090
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:33.951
Oh Dude.

1091
01:03:33.951 --> 01:03:38.810
I'm just flying down the road with this thing dumper dude dumper.

1092
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:43.190
That's a deal breaker.
I'm sorry.
That's a fucking deal breaker.
Done over.

1093
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:48.710
All right.
Just be like,
listen,
uh,
we've come to a fork in the road and a,

1094
01:03:48.711 --> 01:03:51.560
you want to be a model for a panty sniffing website,

1095
01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:54.440
which I totally respect and uh,

1096
01:03:54.441 --> 01:03:58.370
I would like to be with somebody that I can trust,
you know,

1097
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.030
who doesn't need the attention of some of the fucking weirdest people on the

1098
01:04:02.031 --> 01:04:06.890
Internet.
Okay,
good luck.
And thank you for playing.

1099
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.220
Now have you guys ever listened to the uh,

1100
01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:11.940
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1101
01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.720
<v 0>the all things comedy podcasts that I've done,
I do live with the Al Madrigal.</v>

1102
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:20.280
You have listened to those Al Madrigal.
Okay.

1103
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:24.480
Is it very busy man?
So he might not have time to give you breakup advice.

1104
01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.040
Al Madrigal.
It has the greatest way how you break up with a woman that you,

1105
01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:32.970
if you're not living with this woman,
the greatest way ever,

1106
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.280
and I'm giving him full credit here and he's already told the story on a

1107
01:04:38.281 --> 01:04:40.950
podcast,
so I don't feel like I'm overstepping my bounds here.

1108
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:43.560
This is the greatest way ever.
This is what he would do.

1109
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:48.290
When he did knew that he was going to break up with a woman and uh,

1110
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:52.530
women can do this too.
He would,
and the,
the woman was not living with him.

1111
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.040
He would gather up all of her shit that was in the apartment and he would put it

1112
01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:59.610
in a box.
He called her up,
said,
I need to come over there and talk to you.

1113
01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:04.680
He'd come over with the box teller,
it was over and then he would fucking leave.

1114
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.370
And then there was nothing else.
There was no reason for her to come back.

1115
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:09.743
And that was it.

1116
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.780
That's what you need to do with her and you need to pack up all her paintings

1117
01:05:12.781 --> 01:05:17.781
that she's going to be selling in modeling soon so she can become a fucking off

1118
01:05:17.821 --> 01:05:20.250
model.
Okay.

1119
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:25.080
And she's free to do that because it's her body snap 12 to six,
right?

1120
01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:28.710
Is that what they do?
That's her fucking body.
It's her.
Right?

1121
01:05:28.711 --> 01:05:32.790
She's an independent woman.
Beyonce.
The whole fucking thing.
Feminism.
Yeah.

1122
01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:36.600
I'm doing this shit.
Have fun,
sweetheart.
Right?

1123
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.810
She's going to go become a jerk off model and if you stay with her,

1124
01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.310
you will become a jerk off.

1125
01:05:41.311 --> 01:05:44.310
And you don't want to do that because eventually it's going to breed resentment

1126
01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:48.690
and uh,
you know,
dude,
like yeah,
it's going to be over.
You can't marry her.

1127
01:05:48.691 --> 01:05:52.380
You get fucking married.
It's done.
It's fucking over.
It's going to get out.

1128
01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:53.880
Then your neighbor's going to find out.

1129
01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:56.760
Then your neighbors are going to be jerking off to her and then you got to get a

1130
01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:57.630
nickname.

1131
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.660
<v 1>You know it's fucking over.</v>

1132
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.000

All right,
Peter,
Paul,</v>

1133
01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:09.400
any of that shit that,
the alliteration with Pannie.

1134
01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.350
I Dunno what the fuck is going to be,
but you're,
it's,

1135
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:15.700
it's going to be a fucking nightmare.
Jerk off,
Jerry.

1136
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.080
I don't know what the fuck is going to be,
but to do you need to get out,
right?

1137
01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:19.690
<v 1>Bp Dump</v>

1138
01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:23.250
