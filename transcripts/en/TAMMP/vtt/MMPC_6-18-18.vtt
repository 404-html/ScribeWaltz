You can tell somebody to go fuck themselves over here,

27
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.260
Right?
Uh,
before we get started,

28
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.700
a very special thanks to a very special person and a wonderful comedian,

29
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.960
uh,
and,
and,
and equally as well human being.

30
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.320
Mr Tom Rhodes for hooking me up,

31
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.240
he found out I was in patty and he was like,
are you still there?
I said,

32
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.280
he said,
I miss you.

33
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.340
You need to go to this fucking Patisserie.

34
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.630
They have the best fucking sandwiches and Blahblahblahblah and God damn it,

35
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.830
the man was right.
Best Sandwiches I've had over here,

36
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.520
maybe top fucking two or three sandwiches I've ever had in my fucking life.

37
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.170
And then I had a one of those little,
how are all those little fucking cookies?

38
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:36.820
You made a giant one.
It was pistachio.
It was fucking incredible.

39
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.950
You know,

So good.
You start having tourettes and as you're reading it,

40
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:45.460
just ah,

All right.

41
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.480
I was doing that was unbelievable.
Fucking eaten is um,

42
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.200
looking around for people that let them know,
you know,

43
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.070
I know what you're going to say.
What's the name of it?
Bill,

44
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.750
what is the name of the
over there and Perry.

45
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.960
And I only have one thing to say to you far too fair on que les,

46
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.040
I'm not fucking telling you,

47
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.220
cause I don't want to say I don't like standing in lines.
All right?
But Comma,

48
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.260
fucking comedian.
Befriend Tom Rhodes and maybe he'll tell you.

49
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.880
Okay.
But what I ate today was,
was magic.

50
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.260
All right?

51
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.130
And I bet enough around enough magicians in this business to know that you never

52
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:26.140
revealed the trick.
Okay?

53
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.210
<v 0>Tom Road showed me the trick.
Okay?
It says trick tis.
Fuck.
It says join.</v>

55
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.140
Oh my God,
it was fucking unbelievable.

56
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.240
I walked a mile and a half over there and back.
It's my workout in the morning.

57
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:44.420
I just go,
I go for a brisk walk,
you know,

58
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.550
I'm starting to learn how to use those little places where people jog along the

59
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.880
Sen.
Uh,

60
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.110
I go down there so I don't have to deal with the fucking giant groups of people

61
00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:58.940
crossing the street to go to the Notradame.
I actually,
we actually went in the,

62
00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:03.530
um,
we went into that church and I'm glad I did it.
The line moves really quickly.

63
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.630
You go in there,
you're like,
wow,
this is echo app girl.
This is huge.

64
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.530
This is scary.
These statues,
um,

65
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.050
not a lot of positive messages in them.
Flood a misery,

66
00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:20.420
lot of death,
a lot of weeping.
But um,

67
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.630
I think that that's just sort of the vibe back then.
I mean,
people just,

68
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.130
people fucking died back then,
you know,
not like tick,
not today.
People just,

69
00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:29.420
they live for fucking ever.

70
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.180
<v 0>You know what I mean?
At my age,
I see somebody died 70.
I was like,
Oh fuck,</v>

72
00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:39.230
what happened?
What did he eat?
No,
it's too,
so,

73
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.550
<v 2>okay.</v>

74
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.450
<v 0>Do back then you,
you fucking,
you went outside and like a mosquito bit,</v>

75
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:48.620
you and then the whole village died the second you sneezed,

76
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.790
everybody was just done,
you know.
And uh,

77
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:57.791
I believe it was some pompous content that said,

78
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.070
uh,
art imitates life.

79
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.640
So if everybody over there is dying and you're really good with your hands,

80
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:07.670
when you get the clean it there,
what do you think you're going to make?

81
00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:11.210
You can make some fucking miserable statues,
you know,

82
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.660
I'll tell you these,
these,

83
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:17.590
these fucking people around here walking around these pasty white kids thinking

84
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:19.730
that they had goth.
Okay.

85
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.930
Within black nails and lipstick and all of that bullshit.

86
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.651
Let me tell you something.

87
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:28.230
You got nothing on some of these statutes there and in the Notradame.

88
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.610
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.960
<v 0>So you don't have to say to all,
you got kids out there on two fe</v>

90
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.190
to Oculi.
I fuck it up every time.
Whatever.
That's what you do.

91
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:44.650
You just punish people with punish people with your fucking,

92
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.480
I ran into some guy with a file,
get where the fuck I was.

93
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.400
Some guy from Washington DC,

94
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.560
the state.
Right.
And,
uh,

95
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.760
and he was talking about trying to learn French over here.
He's living over here.

96
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.140
He said,
it's brutal,
man.
He goes,
they just,
you know,
you try to speak it to them.

97
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.600
Then they just start speaking English.
And I,
and I told him,
I said,

98
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.150
if I go punish him with it,
I don't give a shit.

99
00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:14.620
If they do the whole thing and fucking English,
you stay,
you stay in the pocket.

100
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.590
Right.
Stay on target.
That Star Wars Shit.

101
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.840
Did I tell you guys that white actually on the plane,

102
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:24.040
I watched one of these plane rides I took,
I watched the owner lows.

103
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.380
One of those star wars movies.
Um,

104
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.900
Laura dern F is for families.
Laura dern was in it.
Um,

105
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.430
the woman who played Princess Leia,

106
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:39.820
I believe it was the last movie she did before.
Unfortunately she passed away.

107
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.180
Uh,

108
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.910
I don't know who else was in a bunch of young people.
All right.
Kids,
kids to me,

109
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.110
kids to me are under the age of 39 at this point.
And,
uh,
I,

110
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.210
I really enjoyed it and I'd like to apologize to anybody on my list.

111
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.170
Offended at comic con.
Um,

112
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.770
I don't remember what the movie was called.
Oh,
there was an,
uh,
Luke Scott,

113
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:07.180
Mark Hamill was in it.

114
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.490
<v 0>Right.
And at the end of the movie,
right.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
Kidding.</v>

116
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.500
Like you nerds haven't watched it 9 million times,
you know,

117
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.130
weeping into a potato sack,
whatever.
You know,

118
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.080
I liked how he was wearing the Ben Kenobi fucking,
um,
like,
you know,

119
00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:25.914
it really,

120
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.620
<v 2>yeah,</v>

121
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.420
<v 0>the messages in Star Wars.</v>

122
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

123
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.910
<v 0>You know that if you actually live a righteous life,</v>

124
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.820
you know that there's really no money in it.

125
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.260
The way the whole game set up and you end up in like a burlap sack for a

126
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:45.580
bathrobe just living by yourself.
You know,
making rocks levitate,

127
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.030
you know,
for tourist or whatever the fuck it is he was doing on that island.

128
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.890
But if,
if you sell your fucking soul to the dark side,

129
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.970
you know,
you get that dope ass outfit,

130
00:07:57.971 --> 00:08:01.210
that fucking Darth Vader head,
you know?

131
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.893
<v 2>Okay.</v>

132
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.250
<v 0>That looks like some shit.
What's his face?
What a design.</v>

133
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.770
Who's the Coosa designer over here in France.

134
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.500
He used to be fat and now he isn't and all he does is shit on fat people and he

135
00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:16.140
won't make clothes for fat people.
Hey Nia,

136
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.300
what's the name of the designer over here?
He's hilarious.

137
00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:25.620
He used to be fat and now and now we are.
Like I said,

138
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.870
you've been on vacation too long.

139
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.670

00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:51.870
What's his name?
Who's Lou?
Grover died.
I don't know what designer to design.

145
00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:56.270
A white haired guy used to be fat Karl Lagerfeld.
Yeah,
it doesn't Darth Vader

146
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.260
<v 3>suit look like some shit he'd come up with.
Oh,
for sure.
Yeah,
there you go.</v>

147
00:08:59.261 --> 00:09:03.580
I fucking nailed it.
You're impressed with some of my fashion knowledge.

148
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.701
You've been a,

149
00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:07.960
you've been proving yourself to be quite the passion needs to out here.

150
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.660
I was telling him,

151
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:13.150
told you the difference between the hoary style and the elegant style,
right?
Yes.

152
00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:14.530
Thanks for explaining that to me.

153
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.960
What do you mean you actually were fascinated by it,
right?

154
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:22.270
Cause we went to lunch and we were talking about how some of the girls were like

155
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:23.800
very elegant in some,
you know,

156
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.280
some were all instagrammy he's desperate.

157
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.550
Like they would like basically the fashion version of a comic with the catch

158
00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:33.820
phrase,
right?
Yes,
exactly.

159
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:39.140
Opposed to me who's all pure up there with my shit and Dick Jokes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

160
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.990
The comedian's comedian.
That's you.

161
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.480
I was going to bust in here and see what you were talking about.

162
00:09:43.481 --> 00:09:46.690
You jerk what's going on?
Uh,
I'll tell you what's going on.

163
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.710
What yesterday for father's Day.
Yay.
My second dose.

164
00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.160
A way.
Um,
that way I,
uh,

165
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.590
we went to the,
uh,

166
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:05.070
von caught us [inaudible] we went to the 24 hours of Lamar and uh,

167
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.450
yeah.
How did you enjoy,
I do enjoy it.

168
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.220
Four hours.
Um,
yeah,
but it's not always like that.
Sometimes it's,

169
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.060
sometimes it's,
hmm,

170
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.393
okay.

171
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.480
Yeah,
but like what,

172
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:45.930
so are you just waiting for somebody to crash or like what's the,

173
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.400
cause it's just round and round.
She goes away,
she stops,
nobody knows.
It's like,

174
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.180
you know,
like it wasn't that exciting.

175
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:59.130
I mean I know that it's a big,
it's a world famous.

176
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.520
Was it cool to at least see cars going that fast,
that close to each other?

177
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.343
You know,

178
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.590
I feel like I've seen cars goes fast before and it doesn't really

179
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.780
do that much for me.
Um,
me,
this is what,
it's fucking hilarious.

180
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.160
It was father's Day.

181
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.540
I would go to Formula One with you because is that the same thing now?

182
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.910
It's just round and round.

183
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:31.030
And because if you sit in the stands and they just fucking drove in a straight

184
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:33.600
line,
it would be over in a minute.

185
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.600
So that's why they go around and around and around.

186
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.750
And then they would also have to clear out,
you know,
for 500 mile race,

187
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.170
if they had to clear up 500 miles of streets in a straight direction.

188
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:46.410
I mean all of a sudden you can't go from Mississippi to fucking the other side

189
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:48.180
of tax lien know in horse racing.

190
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:50.670
And I'm not saying that like horse racing is okay,

191
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.590
but you know how it's like go baby go and everyone's like,
yeah,
yeah,
like chill,

192
00:11:54.591 --> 00:11:57.560
like let's go,
let's go baby go.
There wasn't a lot of that.

193
00:11:57.561 --> 00:12:00.410
Like people are on their phones.
People were eating crepes.

194
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.200
Like it was very like subdued.
Like there wasn't,

195
00:12:03.201 --> 00:12:06.650
it didn't feel like there was a lot of action going on on a lot of excitement is

196
00:12:06.651 --> 00:12:07.440
what I'm saying.

197
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.160
<v 0>Cause it was 24 hour race</v>

198
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.450
<v 3>maybe too long.
Like maybe they shouldn't know.</v>

199
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.920
<v 0>I would say this.
What I thought I was amazing to me is that they had,</v>

200
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.090
I counted,

201
00:12:23.091 --> 00:12:26.960
I was saying this gotta be at least two classes if not three classes of cars out

202
00:12:26.961 --> 00:12:29.360
there.
It turns out there was four different classes.

203
00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:33.320
So I think there was like four winners in each class,
one for each class.

204
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.910
But we got there on the second day when we showed up,

205
00:12:37.911 --> 00:12:42.830
there was two cars in the lead lap,
both Toyota's.
Um,

206
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.600
and the guy in first place was ahead by like a minute and a half,

207
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.910
which is like a,
you know,

208
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.480
that's like almost the back of the race than anything else.

209
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:58.040
And then the game third place was 12 laps down.
So I was Kinda like,
oh,

210
00:12:58.041 --> 00:12:58.874
so this thing,

211
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.970
we this three hours to go and this is already over unless somebody crashes or

212
00:13:03.981 --> 00:13:05.060
has a problem with their car.

213
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:10.040
And then the Toyota in second place did have a problem with this car briefly.
Um,

214
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.970
which put him even further back then he was down two laps and then,
um,

215
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.540
so yeah.
Um,
it's more of like an endurance thing.

216
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.010
I thought it was fascinating because um,
if I would recommend if you go to it,

217
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.880
go for the start or I would go at night just to see him at night.

218
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:28.850
It was kind of cool to see the brake lights and wipers and shit.

219
00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:31.550
I've never seen that on race cars.
It's usually just like,

220
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.530
it's just a shell for a body with a rolled the whole full roll cage.

221
00:13:36.531 --> 00:13:40.480
And it's just the powertrain that says
the wipers.

222
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.160
<v 3>Yeah,
it was for me.
You know,
it's funny.
No,
no,
no.</v>

223
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.003
You know what it is.

224
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.340
<v 0>No,
it is.
Yes.
Steve McQueen and all that shit.
It was,
it was it just to know.</v>

225
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.450
I mean people had died and the balls that it takes and all of that shit to do
it.

226
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.290
And uh,
I gotta be honest with you,
you know,
we were driving out there,

227
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.610
you will listen to you beyond saying you Jay z and then we got there and you

228
00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:12.611
were on your phone the entire fucking time and it may be feel good about that

229
00:14:13.251 --> 00:14:18.200
time I walked out when you were you,
you said you were quote in this play.

230
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.040
<v 3>Um,
first of all,
that is not the same thing.</v>

231
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.100
How dare you even make that comparison and I'll make it again.

232
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.450
Don't you yell at me on my own phone the whole time I was taking Instagram video

233
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.460
of you.
Okay.
And Instagram,

234
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
you and myself and the race I was on the whole entire time and I didn't walk

235
00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:40.340
out.
Okay.
I wasn't like,
all right,
I'll,

236
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.270
I'll be in the car and say the same thing about that place.

237
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.400
I sat through the first half of it.

238
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.450
Were you in the 24 [inaudible] where are you in it?
Where you driving?

239
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.070
And I walked out.
No father's day.
No,
it's not the same thing I was,

240
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.820
I was the the narrator of that show and you walked out because you were like

241
00:15:01.031 --> 00:15:05.090
bored and it was so rude and it really hurt my head,

242
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.180
I believe.
No,
you did it.
You did it for entirely selfish reason.

243
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.210
You were sitting right in my line of view and then we come back from

244
00:15:13.211 --> 00:15:14.830
intermission and you're fucking gone.

245
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.030
And I can't even believe there was a white guy rapping and it was a play.

246
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.560
It's a towards things ever combined and I sat for 90 minutes of it and you're a

247
00:15:23.561 --> 00:15:27.220
better actor than anybody there and all they had to do was go and later at the

248
00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:31.000
hall of Justice,
it annoyed me.
I can't even believe that you would bring that up.

249
00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:35.230
So many years later.
How long have you known me?
I'm going to bring that up.

250
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.820
So many years later after this.

251
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.780
You really are like the king of bringing back subway.
Yeah.

252
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.790
Remember back when and it's like we've been together for 15 years.

253
00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:46.110
You're literally bringing up something from like year two of our relationship.

254
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.500
What else do I bring up from way back when?
Like a lot of stuff.
Oh good boy.

255
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.250
You're the king of making a big statement and then he can't back it up.

256
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.740
That's the fucking point of it is I am the God damn king.
Oh,

257
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:04.630
good one.
Take that to the bank.
No,

258
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.750
<v 0>auto racing is he tortures thing to bring to somebody who doesn't give a shit</v>

259
00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:13.560
about cars.
We met that really Nice Guy,

260
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.340
Ryan hilly and he's the one who taught me how to say,
go fuck yourself.

261
00:16:17.341 --> 00:16:19.210
What's that Brian?
Um,

262
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.440
he was really nice and he was very nice and he helped me out with my phones.

263
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.340
Um,
I enjoy,
I can't believe I went there.
Oh,
this is the,
here's a great one.

264
00:16:29.341 --> 00:16:32.040
So Nia doesn't like beer.
There's no wine there.

265
00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:35.400
So I keep buying two beers and it's like,
oh,
you don't want to finish that.

266
00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:40.110
So I'm drinking daddy's having a good time on father's day.
Right.
So I bought a

267
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.630
<v 3>crepes there,
but no wine.
I mean this is France,
but that's really,</v>

268
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.310
it was grapes to them.
It's just suck a fucking sandwich.
That was really kind of,

269
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.750
what about the other guy?

270
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.680
Is it insulting if I say that it's like the Nascar France,

271
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.540
that's insulting because Nascar is not on the same level as 24 hour

272
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.060
<v 0>Lamar.
Oh,
I don't know what you mean.</v>

273
00:17:04.061 --> 00:17:07.630
I think that you were more looking at it like you were outside Paris,

274
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:10.990
so there wasn't as many fancy clothes to people walking around.

275
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.700
Um,
I think that that sort of,
as you're very,
you,
you know,

276
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.700
you're a class kind of person,
like,
oh,

277
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.340
<v 3>right here nor there.
I'm up here.</v>

278
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.370
Interesting.
Because people are all my comments being like,
well,

279
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.390
I hope you are a nice little later.
It'll be,
didn't busy while,
or like,
you know,

280
00:17:34.391 --> 00:17:38.730
what do they say to me?
Do they say that?
Yeah.

281
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.630
When every fucking week,
let me see.

282
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.060
I want to say I want the receipts even with the receipts.
Well,

283
00:17:45.061 --> 00:17:48.150
I want Y'all fucking receipts then I'll show you myself coming here.
Like you,

284
00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.920
the FBI dude going to turn over my laptop to you.

285
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.690
Um,
oh,

Yes we did.

286
00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:58.990
We had a great time over here and uh,

287
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.240
tonight we are seeing a guns [inaudible] roses tonight.

288
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.810
Uh,

289
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.700
it's hard to hold a candle in the girl November Ray.

290
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.780
That was good.
Thank you.
I've never seen them in concert,
so

291
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.450
it's going to be awesome.
So,
uh,

292
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.600
that's what we're doing and then we're going to look in and then we fly back.

293
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:31.630
I hope he says that.
How do you say that in French?
I thought you,

294
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.500
you learned that I want to learn this.

295
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.053
Um,

296
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.210
anyways,
I dunno.
I've been having a good time.
Ha Ha.

297
00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.520
How I have been torturing people with my French,
haven't I?
Yeah,
I don't,

298
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.740
when they go to English,
I don't give a fuck.
It's like,
it's the most fun.

299
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.110
It's so much fucking fun to just,
uh,
just some French people will humor you,

300
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.250
but a lot of times they like can't be bothered.
Remember when,
um,
oh,

301
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:17.250
remember what was the rest of dropped we went to and we were having a hard time

302
00:19:17.251 --> 00:19:22.080
figuring out the menu and uh,
I was saying,
so the guy,
I asked him,
I said,
oh,

303
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:25.320
can you translate some of this stuff for us?
And he goes,
oh,
I don't,

304
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:28.380
I just get you an English menu.
And I was like,
yeah,
okay.
And you were like,
oh no,

305
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:29.820
no.
I want to know sweat.
It's like,
Bill,

306
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:33.810
he doesn't want to sit here and translate the entire menu when it was an
English.

307
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.710
Hmm.
How does parents make their money?
Taurus.

308
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.070
Yeah.
Fucking humor me.
Okay.
But it doesn't work like that.

309
00:19:43.071 --> 00:19:47.960
And you come over to my co dia huge day.
A little bit that you did that,
you know,

310
00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:51.350
we miss,
it's walking down the street there.
I know they're all fucking,
don't,

311
00:19:51.351 --> 00:19:52.230
don't pull that shit.
I don't,

312
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.880
I'm so sick of hearing that every fucking person who isn't from America is

313
00:19:55.881 --> 00:19:59.600
fucking is the greatest person ever.
I'm walking right now.
Hang on a second.
Yeah.

314
00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:03.890
I gotta go get my charger here.
When we're walking.
I'm always,

315
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.530
always spinning.
Always moving.
Kyle again.
Um,

316
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.140
I don't know what the fuck it is.
No,
no,
I don't,
I don't do that.

317
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.200
Okay.
People here in France or just like Americans.
Okay.
Some of them are nice,

318
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.230
some of them are not,
and a lot of them are fat.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah,

319
00:20:23.231 --> 00:20:27.430
there's a lot of fucking fag teacher again,
the maintenance man.
Okay.

320
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.600
Well Dot.
Again,
you genius.
Um,
all right.

321
00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:36.130
Do you have anything else to add about how,
uh,
you know,
okay,
here's the thing.

322
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:36.490
All right,

323
00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.260
so maybe you didn't do it to the level of walking out halfway through a play

324
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.790
with,
I want to reiterate again,
it's just in defense to my listeners.

325
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.140
It was a play and there was white guy rapping the entire time.

326
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.440
Okay.
And it wasn't M&amp;M

327
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.560
eyebrows up like he was blowing my mind.
I set to 90 minutes of that

328
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.580
as you sat over in the fucking corner,
you get away later.

329
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.140
Paging Mrs. Herman
at the Front Desk.
Yeah.

330
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:14.974
What the fuck.

331
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.150
And then I went out to the stage directions because it wasn't a full production.

332
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.510
It was kind of like a re staged reading.
So I was,
it was a musical.

333
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:30.040
I don't sing.
So you know,
I was there doing the stage directions.
I got paid.

334
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:33.330
It was a Gig.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,

335
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:40.180
I quoted the shit out of you.
I didn't make you own.
Wow.
I didn't walk out.

336
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.800
I went out and I had a Sam Adams and I was like,

337
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.760
and I came back,
wait,
let me finish.
And I sat down.
I was like,
fuck,

338
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:49.900
that was delicious.

339
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.640
That was as delicious as what I just saw was horrific.

340
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.010
And I was just like,
maybe if I stay out here,
she won't notice.
It was totally,

341
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.280
totally,
totally selfish.

342
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.540
And I have apologized and there'd be kids because of the guilt that I try to

343
00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:09.650
bring you down to my level.
Oh wait.

344
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.560
And that's what it is because I love you so much.
Oh please.
And uh,

345
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.580
changed me the,
you know,
just because you know,

346
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:20.230
I do all these great things for you,

347
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.130
son of a gun.
When I learned what I learned it from,
I don't know.

348
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.740
I'm not going to,
you cry on cue.

349
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.430
Oh God.
Did you just try to be Sassy?
Yeah,
cases face.

350
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.680
I just felt like I was doing it.
Did they rebuilt good times?

351
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:39.514
What just happened there?

352
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.380
We'll be right back with white,
red,

353
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.810
black meaning fucking messages.
Anyway.

354
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.440
Wait,
read.
Um,
all right.

355
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.960
Are you going to miss this apartment?

356
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.030
I'm ready to go home after the gods are roses thing is going to be as perfect.

357
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.970
We're going to do that and then we fucking go home.
I ready to go back,

358
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.630
eat some keen to work,
get back on my diet,
hit the elliptical.
Oh,

359
00:23:07.631 --> 00:23:12.610

So fucking good.
It's so good.

360
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.420
Yeah,
but you don't get as fat as if to eat them over there.
You know,

361
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.390
who makes them?
Howard Johnson,
who makes them in our country.

362
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.160
It makes the bag a couple of places in la that have really good and intimate

363
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.990
Pepperidge farm.
There's some good places that have amazing clusel,

364
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.880
but no,
not like here.
Okay.
All right.

365
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:38.620
Well thank you for coming out.
Let me,
let me finish this fucking thing.
Oh,

366
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:42.910
you're not done,
Huh?
No,
I'm only 23 minutes and this is usually when I,

367
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.150
when I butcher.
Oh God.
Are you sharing

368
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.890
<v 0>your story?
All right.
Uh,

369
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:52.610
you know certain certain people have to take a nap in here.
Oh,

370
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:56.330
well you told me to come in here and about an hour.
About an hour.
They do.

371
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.080
All right.
We'll get you walking out on the podcast the way I did on your play,

372
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:06.210
chase.
I guess we're even now.
Try it.
Oh my God.
Oh,

373
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.270
whoa,
whoa.
I'm a dumb.
Oh God,
Dude.
They're the fucking way was

374
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.880
that fucking blade was the worst.
Okay.
Oh,

375
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.380
this fucking kid jumped to do do with your p two p.
D.
Dot.

376
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.660
Up to doing the fucking thing with his hands.
Oh,

377
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.800
it was,
it was,
it was in a bar.

378
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.360
How fucking long are you supposed to sit there for that,
you know,

379
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.660
and she gets to go to a Goddamn car race and fucking sit there and

380
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.250
look up dancing with the stars.
Shit is,
I'm sitting there.

381
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.010
She clearly bored out of her fucking mind.

382
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.470
Bored out of her fucking mind at that fucking race.

383
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.750
Tough like fucking shoe leather that moves around.
Um,
all right.

384
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:55.910
Where the fuck is the advertising for this?
You know,

385
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.920
I'll never live down that I knew it.
You know,

386
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:02.810
it's so fucking stupid is if I just went back in for the final 90 fucking

387
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:07.260
minutes.
Um,
I'm the king of bringing up shit.
Yeah.

388
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.490
Anytime she's fucking brought that up to me.
Put it this way.

389
00:25:10.491 --> 00:25:14.630
I've got yelled at that longer than the fucking play was.
All right.
Uh,

390
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.590
please don't read on air.
Uh,

391
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.780
this is a note from somebody.
Host says he doesn't know what he's saying.

392
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:28.250
And at the end he offs advice that directly contradicts what he read.

393
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.700
They just ask that you not imply something.
Okay.
A right.

394
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.580
A right.
A right.
Everybody fucking relax.

395
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.090
He says Christ pay.
It's not about giving people information,

396
00:25:43.091 --> 00:25:47.350
it's about it being entertaining.
All right,
policy genius.

397
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.570
If you have a car at what you,

398
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.710
you have car insurance,

399
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.540
if you have a home number is that you have home insurance.

400
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.680
If you are alive,
shouldn't you have life insurance?

401
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.470
Okay,
410 people don't have life insurance at all and it's not their fault.

402
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.260
It's not light.
It's life insurance is fault.

403
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.190
Shopping for life insurance is confusing and it takes forever.

404
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:21.180
So Pauli Genius made 80 g I don't even have good thing,

405
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.120
man.

406
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.800
Paulie genius is the easy way to compare life insurance online and just five

407
00:26:26.801 --> 00:26:27.041
minutes.

408
00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:31.750
You can compare quotes from the top insurers to find the best policy for you.

409
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.400
And when you compare quotes,
you save money.
It's that simple.
In fact,

410
00:26:36.401 --> 00:26:40.240
Paulie Policy,
oh that Pauli gene policy genius,

411
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:46.530
it's the greatest policy ever has helped over 4 million people shopped for

412
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:51.531
insurance and placed over $20 billion in coverage and then I'll make life and

413
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.320
they don't make just make life insurance easy.

414
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.980
They also compare disability insurance,

415
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:03.120
renter's insurance and health insurance.
If you care about it,
they can cover it.

416
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.200
You've been putting off getting life insurance.
Don't put it off any longer.

417
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:09.990
You've got to do this stuff by the way,
especially you've got a wife and family,

418
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:12.760
you know you've got kids and shit.
You got to do it.
It's the greatest feeling.

419
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.280
I know it's weird,
you know,
contemplating your own mortality,

420
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:19.680
but after you did it,
you got that.
Hey,
you know,
if I die,

421
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:22.530
everybody's going to be good.
Be a fucking keg party.
It's a great feeling.

422
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.090
Unless you're married to a psycho,

423
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.130
it's never been easier to buy and rates are at a 20 year low policy,

424
00:27:28.131 --> 00:27:32.460
genius.com the easy way to compare and buy Life Insurance Pol.

425
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.520
I see why Ge,
e I u s policy,

426
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.870
genius.com if you guys see that stupid commercial with that woman is just like

427
00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:42.120
go and you know,

428
00:27:42.121 --> 00:27:47.121
I had insurance on my car and you know when my wrecked my car,

429
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.280
they only gave me,
you know,

430
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.180
I pay 12 grand from my car and it's five years later and they only gave me six

431
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:57.000
four,
what am I supposed to do by half a car?

432
00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.100
Now you had the wrong insurance.
I love it.
They act like,
you know,

433
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.820
there's two types of insurance.
You can get insurance,
that cheaper kind,

434
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.300
which is they're going to give you the money for the value of whatever the fuck

435
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:13.380
it is that you insured at that what it is at that time to appreciate it.

436
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.970
Or you can buy,

437
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:19.260
replace it new and that's going to cost you way more fucking money.

438
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.230
So that woman is yelling at the insurance company and the reality is,

439
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.900
is she's fucking naive.
Well she's just an actor.

440
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.530
Whoever wrote that fucking thing is,
is it's,
it's not like this,

441
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:30.690
this new insurance company that is now,
you know,

442
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:35.460
going to fucking give you 12 grand fee of $12,000 car 10 years after the body.

443
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.890
You're going to fucking pay for that.
All right?

444
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:39.330
And it's going to cost a lot of money.

445
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.330
And if you add up what the fuck he paid for it over the years,

446
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.750
it's really probably not that much of a difference.
Okay?

447
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:50.850
Simply safe,
everybody.
It's important to protect your hoe.

448
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:52.680
What the hub security system,

449
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.020
how can we protect your home and your privacy?
Uh,

450
00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:00.150
that's what you're going to love about simply safe.

451
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.140
They obsess over details like no home security company.

452
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.760
Here's an example.

453
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.020
Simply safe has a camera you can control from your phone,

454
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.360
but they want to protect your home and your privacy.

455
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:17.250
So they came up with this brilliant idea,
a privacy shutter for their camera.

456
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.110
Now it's definitely safe wanting to you to be able to hear the shutter clicks so

457
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:23.490
you know it's closed.

458
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.110
They wanted it to have a light on it so you can easily tell when it's on.

459
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.700
They needed it to work for the entire lifespan of the system.
So simply safe.

460
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:36.530
Got To work.

More shawls.
Um,

476
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.210
all right.
So anyways,
oh my God.
I mean,
it's such a,
you want,

477
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.520
I made such a fucking ass of myself.
I've eaten so much French food.
Okay.

478
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.510
I got focused baguettes coming out of my fork and he is over here and I'm

479
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.120
growing a fucking bra on my hair.
Used to be okay.

480
00:30:51.121 --> 00:30:55.140
And Betty opposed to walk up though.
So I up the street,
they had this,
uh,

481
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.000
they had a little pizzeria.
So Mike,
okay,

482
00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.480
there's no way this pizza can be as bad as a pizza in la.
You know,

483
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.780
I know it's not gonna be as good as Italy.
Who gives a fuck,
right?

484
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.500
So I'm trying to find this place.

485
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.610
And what happens when you're in a country where you don't speak the language is

486
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:14.611
a lot of times you stop reading words and you just start looking at colors of

487
00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:17.980
thanks.
And you start like,
um,

488
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.040
like anything yellow is a taxi.

489
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.820
Anything blue becomes a police car and like tat type of Shit.

490
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:28.480
So there was this restaurant with this red awning,

491
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.570
like the Italian restaurant,
and I'm looking at it going,
I dunno,
man,

492
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.600
it doesn't quite look right.
And rather than just reading

493
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.880
the French,
what does it [inaudible] or something like that,
whatever.

494
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:43.930
I went up to the guy and I was just looking at the menu and I was just,
you know,

495
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:48.790
I was just tired
and I couldn't find any pieces,
anything.
So finally I just,

496
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.800
this guy walks up to one of the fucking ways.
It's like,
you know,
Bone Juma,

497
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.210
showbiz.
It been a bit of dinner.
I am say Susan Wa,
uh,

498
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.890
is this a Italian restaurant?
And he just like goes cause like,
ah,

499
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.230
it's like no miss yet.

500
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.950
This is a French restaurant and he just fucking walked away.

501
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.830
I felt like such an asshole.
What does it a Brasserie,
whatever it means.

502
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.080
It's was written right there across the red on it.

503
00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:15.750
And then it went one more block up and there's the red awning.

504
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.340
That was the Italian place.

505
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

506
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:22.560
<v 0>And I wonder,
yell down.
Excuse me.
Yeah.</v>

507
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.920
I was only off by a block.
Go Fuck Yourself.
But I know he was right.

508
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.390
And I went in and I ordered two pieces,
right?

509
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.880
I got the Margarita and then I got the one with the end.

510
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.150
Joe On it and a I gotta tell Ya,

511
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.020
it was fucking horrific or worse than the pizza in.
But the,

512
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.690
<v 3>uh,</v>

513
00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:45.210
[inaudible] knee swat was a puff famous yet,

514
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.790
um,
was actually delicious.
But um,
I might have been to get through tonight.

515
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.660
I just,
I can't fucking do it anymore.

516
00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.970
I stayed here just a couple of days too long,

517
00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.010
but I got to see guns and roses.

518
00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.770
You want to hear my whole fucking guns and roses story here?

519
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:03.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

520
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.690
<v 3>Okay.
Uh,</v>

521
00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.040
the first time they came around in a city that I was in,

522
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.610
they were opening for Motley Crue,
the original lineup.

523
00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:17.440
And I forget why I fucking miss that show.
All right.

524
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:20.080
And then,
um,

525
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:26.330
then they use your illusion tour came out and I had a ticket to see him on that

526
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:29.000
one.
And then one of my buddies,
you know,

527
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.890
the love of his life dumped him and he was fucking devastated,

528
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:38.891
borderline suicidal and he needed some sort of fucking light and his life.

529
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:42.830
So I said,
hey,
I got a ticket to guns and roses.
You Go,
you need it.

530
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.120
Cause I don't want to see a kill yourself.
And he said,
I appreciate that man.

531
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.250
And then,
you know,
all the drama happened,
you know,

532
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.790
and all the,
you know,
the whole band basically was just axle,
right.

533
00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.320
And then they didn't talk for like 10 fucking years or something like that.

534
00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:02.420
And by then I was a comedian.
I just stayed up.

535
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.700
And then when they got back together,

536
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.770
I had a hookup to go to the show at the fucking club there,

537
00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:13.910
the troubadour there,
first time back together,
I had a ticket for that,

538
00:34:13.911 --> 00:34:18.500
but I was working on the road.
I couldn't go every fucking time.

539
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:20.090
I've tried to see this band,

540
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:26.390
one of my favorite bands of all fucking time.
Um,

541
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.780
I,
I just,
something has always happened where I haven't been able to go.

542
00:34:31.781 --> 00:34:34.900
So finally,
finally,
I'm going to see him tonight.
I can't fucking wait.

543
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.770
It's going to be a,
yeah,

544
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.870
that's not even going to be real until it starts happening.

545
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:45.100
That's how long you been waiting to see this frigging bent.
So anyways,

546
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.570
very excited about that animal.

547
00:34:46.571 --> 00:34:51.400
So a great way to wind up a perfect trip and then get back to the states.

548
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.810
And do some standup because I have not done stand up in a couple of weeks.

549
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.920
All fucking Rusty Jones is going to limp on stage down to the comedy store later

550
00:34:59.921 --> 00:35:04.110
on this weekend.
Probably try to get my fucking act back together.
So,
uh,
anyway,

551
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.830
so let's,
um,
my daughter has to take a nap.
My lovely daughter,
she's so cute.

552
00:35:08.831 --> 00:35:13.831
She can say all these French words now we bone bone jewel.

553
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.780
Um,
why isn't this light working?
I can't even see him anytime I've done yet.

554
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.070
All right,
let's just read a couple of questions here.
Oh,

555
00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:28.850
it's on 24 hours in a month.
Uh,
Lamar,
uh,

556
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.760
hey Billy Borgen y'all.

557
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.310
I just heard you say you were going to Lamar for,
of the race.
I'm from Cleveland,

558
00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:37.860
but able to go

559
00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.960
<v 0>to the 24 hours twice when I happen to be in France for work the same week.</v>

560
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.390
Not sure what your plans are there,

561
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.900
but had to let you know about an awesome hidden gem along the muscling straight.

562
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.060
My first time,
they're 2012,

563
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.980
a friend came out to meet me and we drove down the with essentially no plans.

564
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.500
Didn't have tickets or a place to stay that night.

565
00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:04.680
We bought tickets at the gate and gone and just in time for the start.

566
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:09.210
Then ended up befriending and drinking with a group of Brits that lasted most of

567
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:13.360
the day.
Uh,
this is how you do it.
One of the outlets who,

568
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.220
when to do the next time.

569
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:19.050
One of them told us of a bar somewhere along the no way,

570
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:24.060
the ridiculously long straight that runs a few miles away from the area of the

571
00:36:24.061 --> 00:36:28.150
track you get access to or you get access to what the ticket.

572
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:32.310
So him and the two of us decided to leave the track and catch a cab to try

573
00:36:32.311 --> 00:36:35.880
finding it took forever seeking it out though.
Random back roads.

574
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:40.881
The streets you would usually get to it are on weight.

575
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:46.910
The street you would usually get to it on is the race track found out after the

576
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:51.120
fact.
The place is called.
I can't read this

577
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:57.420
or bearish there on the and was a great spot to eat,

578
00:36:57.421 --> 00:37:01.440
drink while catching a short glimpse of cars at top speed just before the first

579
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:05.100
chicane.
I would definitely recommend seeking it out if possible.

580
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:09.390
But also I learned on my second trip there a few years later,

581
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.340
he should definitely make a reservation.

582
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:16.170
Maybe it's not so hidden anymore because it was too crowded to get in and they

583
00:37:16.171 --> 00:37:19.760
only speak French if you call for one.
Uh,

584
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.290
we stayed there late into the night that first time.

585
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.040
Eventually one of the restaurant employees gave us a ride back to our car on the

586
00:37:26.041 --> 00:37:28.810
other side of the track where we,
oh you,

587
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.810
you'd like stay there for the whole fucking race now we got maybe a couple hours

588
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:36.020
of sleep anyways,
just had to tell you about that.

589
00:37:36.021 --> 00:37:38.430
That track is so crazy compared to anything.

590
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:42.000
You'll see an f one is definitely worth getting outside of the main area.

591
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.270
Whether you seek out that spot or somewhere else,

592
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.070
just to get an idea of how massive the track is and see them doing 200 miles an

593
00:37:50.071 --> 00:37:53.850
hour down dark country roads with just their headlights to the track.

594
00:37:53.851 --> 00:37:58.110
Not sure if you'll actually get this message before.
Uh,
I missed all of that.

595
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:02.550
I was on the main straightaway and it just looked like a regular race truck.
Um,

596
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.670
while I'll be like,
Yo,
the second time around,
hopefully I'll get it right.

597
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.600
God dammit.
I didn't know there was all of that,

598
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.720
a rejection letters.

599
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.900
You know what was crazy was there was a fucking airport like re like parallel,

600
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:21.930
like right.
Almost touching the main straightaway.

601
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:26.670
And I kept seeing these helicopters like taken off and shit.
You know,

602
00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:30.420
I thought they were just following the race and now all of a sudden I sound like

603
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:35.421
a fucking Leer jet flying right along where a helicopter just been along.

604
00:38:35.541 --> 00:38:38.420
I'm like,
there's no way that's fucking safe.
What is that all about?

605
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.570
Is that some rich guy just going,
I don't give a fuck.

606
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.540
I'm paying you buzz the fucking race track.

607
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:47.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

608
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.240
<v 0>We've around these fucking helicopters,
you know,
but turned out there was a,
um,</v>

609
00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:52.590
<v 2>yeah,</v>

610
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:57.190
<v 0>there was a uh,
airport right there.
Um,
anyways.</v>

611
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.950
Anyways.
Oh it is.
This one is this one.
I should bring Leah in here for this one.

612
00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:06.920
Really rejection letters.
Psycho
bill wondering if you saw this.

613
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:11.150
This accomplished clarinet player was accepted to his dream school.

614
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

615
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.810
<v 0>Uh,</v>

616
00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:17.570
but never received the good news because his then girlfriend deleted it and sent

617
00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:22.571
him a fake rejection email that turned out to be a $265,000 mistake on her part.

618
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.770
<v 2>MMM.</v>

619
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:33.110
<v 0>Okay.
Let's see what the fuck happened.
Uh,
all right.
This kid,</v>

620
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:37.760
his hard work paid off the accomplished clarinet had been accepted to his dream

621
00:39:37.761 --> 00:39:39.800
school,
but he never got to hear the good news.

622
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.190
That's because when his acceptance email arrived in 2014,

623
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:48.490
his then girlfriend deleted it and sent him a fake rejection email from the

624
00:39:48.671 --> 00:39:52.970
school.
Was it $265,000 mistake?

625
00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.590
He said it was really

626
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.300
<v 2>okay.</v>

627
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.820
<v 0>Devastating to feel that incredible betrayal.</v>

628
00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.200
It may be think of our whole relationship and made me feel like everything might

629
00:40:01.201 --> 00:40:03.780
have been a lie.
Uh,
anywhere.

630
00:40:03.781 --> 00:40:07.450
It began a college sophomore studying music at Mcgill University.
At the time,

631
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.440
this kid had applied to a two year full scholarship program to finish his

632
00:40:11.441 --> 00:40:16.150
bachelor's degree at the Colburn Conservatory of Music in Los Angeles.

633
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.850
Itching to study with a renowned clarinet.
Teacher.

634
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.920
So-And-So spent many late nights in practice rooms to prepare for his audition,

635
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:27.520
which he thought went well.
The full scholarship,
which includes tuition,

636
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.490
room and board is worth about 50 grand a year.

637
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:35.850
And so and so said graduating from Colburn would have sent him up for a high Ph,

638
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.350
set them up for high paying symphony career.
When he was rejects this,

639
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:44.230
uh,
the kid was crushed.
It was disappointing feeling.
He said,

640
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:46.930
I had such high hopes,
uh,
the kid would,

641
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.500
would have studied with this person who was considered one of the best clarinet

642
00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:54.730
instructors in the world.
Uh,
he said,
uh,

643
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.940
the school accepts only two students each year at Colburn,

644
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.080
and he was one of them.

645
00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:00.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

646
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.300
<v 0>Um,
how she covered her tracks this Wednesday,</v>

647
00:41:03.301 --> 00:41:06.690
a Canadian court ruled that this guy's ex-girlfriend,

648
00:41:06.691 --> 00:41:11.310
older more than $265,000,
350 grand Canadian for damages,

649
00:41:11.311 --> 00:41:14.090
including loss of reputation,
educational opportunity,

650
00:41:14.091 --> 00:41:18.570
and two years of potential income.
Roughly $37,000.

651
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.890
Can you fucking,
can you believe like the level

652
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.050
<v 2>of like</v>

653
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.860
<v 0>breaking into is eat.
Like she had to be snowing,
that he,
that letter coming,</v>

654
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.090
she had three constantly scan for her.
So much she knows his fucking,

655
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.400
I guess computer passwords.
It's just scanning and scanning saying finds it,

656
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:44.990
sees it.
He gets accepted.

657
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.440
Fucking delete this guy's dream and then comes up with a whole phony thing.

658
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.260
I don't even know.
I want to how the fuck they found out.
But this is why this,

659
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:59.150
this whole talk and you know this me too shit now where they're just saying

660
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:04.151
straight across the board believe women when there's women like that out there,

661
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:09.250
okay,
there's a reason why that there's due process and you,

662
00:42:09.251 --> 00:42:13.490
you have to have evidence and you have to listen to both sides of the fucking

663
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:14.600
story.
Yet again,

664
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.450
another person was accused this week and without the person being accused,

665
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:23.780
without them ever responding this,

666
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.690
this stuff that people wrote on Twitter,

667
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.750
I always knew this person was a piece of shit.
Uh,

668
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.810
I love one person was a fucking most self serving thing ever.

669
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:41.090
If you still fall in so and so,
unfollow me,
right?

670
00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:45.950
Like,
like,
wow,
man,
you're really sticking up for women.
You're willing to lose,

671
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:51.010
to lose like fucking Twitter followers way to make a fucking stair stop making

672
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:54.860
it about yourself.
You fucking jerk off.
Um,

673
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.230
and I'm not saying anybody innocent,
guilty or whatever.
Uh,

674
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.650
the reality is then the guy then responds and says,
no,
look,
we argued and blah,

675
00:43:03.651 --> 00:43:04.520
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

676
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:08.270
And she ended up being unfaithful to me and I didn't want to be with somebody.

677
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:11.210
That one that was unfaithful to me.
So then at that point,

678
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.470
I just want to know like,
how does,
how does anybody make a judgment?

679
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.480
Any sane,
rational person?
Like you read her story like,
wow,
man,

680
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:23.450
that's really fucked up,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And then you read his thing.

681
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:26.600
It's like,
oh,
well then there's that side of it.
So then what

682
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.030
you just now at that point,
you've read two things online.

683
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.970
Like just imagine a court in a court of law.
Uh,

684
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:43.030
somebody like entire future was on the line and the plaintiff and the defendant,

685
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.140
all they were going to do was write two paragraphs of,

686
00:43:48.141 --> 00:43:50.090
I don't know if you'd call it a blog or whatever,

687
00:43:50.091 --> 00:43:53.690
and then you are going to determine,
you know,

688
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:58.640
somebodies ability to continue their career or not.
Is,
is I,
am I,

689
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.010
that's a little fucking nuts.
People,

690
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.210
and this is what's driving me up the wall is I've been saying this,

691
00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:08.780
it's shows and you know,
the vibe is,

692
00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:12.710
people fucking agree with that,
but everybody's afraid to say it.

693
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.220
So it's just,
I know,
it's just not a,
uh,

694
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.410
this,
you know,
this shit that guys had been doing,

695
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:23.120
a women has to fucking stop.

696
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:28.130
But I don't think the way to go about it is to just make blanket statements of

697
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.420
believe women.
Like it's like all of them.

698
00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.460
Even the ones who keep people's cars and fucking

699
00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.110
break laptops and destruction of property,
all of that.

700
00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.940
Even the ones that fucking,
you know,

701
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.510
are out there saying that they love somebody just cause the guy's got fucking

702
00:44:47.511 --> 00:44:52.340
all of them.
I don't know.
It's really,
it's a little fucking,

703
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:56.930
uh,
it's,
uh,
it's just such a fucking,
I never heard it.
I can't,

704
00:44:56.931 --> 00:45:00.200
I why out of all is,
I'm just really surprised at how fucking,

705
00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.540
just how afraid everybody isn't.
Hi.

706
00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.430
Everybody just chooses self preservation and they'll sit there and they'll watch

707
00:45:07.431 --> 00:45:11.780
somebody twist in the wind.
You know,
cause there's been,
you know,

708
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.570
there's been the ones that are obviously like this guy's a fucking monster,

709
00:45:14.571 --> 00:45:17.960
this guy should be in jail.
And then there's been some other ones like what?

710
00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.450
And it,
but everybody's still shuts the fuck up while these loan,

711
00:45:22.451 --> 00:45:25.850
it ticks on Twitter or like,
you know,
fucking burn him at the stake.

712
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.070
Um,
I dunno,
I keep thinking that eventually,
like it's,

713
00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:35.030
it's Kinda like calm down a little bit where people are going to be like,
okay,

714
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.200
yeah,
what if that what that woman wrote is true.
This needs to happen.

715
00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:44.350
Why don't we all just hang on a second and listen to what the guy has to say it.

716
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.300
And then even then all you've done is just,
it's,

717
00:45:47.301 --> 00:45:49.640
that's like you show up at a fucking car accident

718
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:55.640
and it both drivers at point at each other
and you know,

719
00:45:55.641 --> 00:45:57.830
and you weren't there when it fucking happened.
I don't know.

720
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:01.130
That's another thing too,
when you watch all of these,
like these,

721
00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.450
these videos and shit of,
of,
you know,

722
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.370
injustices happening.

723
00:46:07.371 --> 00:46:11.900
What I can't stand about those fucking videos is it always starts asked for the

724
00:46:11.901 --> 00:46:16.901
most part after the injustice happened and it's one person's point of view on it

725
00:46:18.861 --> 00:46:23.390
and everybody just watches it and acts like they just saw a documentary or

726
00:46:23.391 --> 00:46:27.200
actually just watched the footage from beginning to end.
Um,

727
00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:33.500
or maybe it isn't.
Maybe it's just a 30,000 fucking lunatics on,
on social media.

728
00:46:33.501 --> 00:46:38.190
I have no idea.
But,
uh,
I dunno,
like Nia,

729
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:40.650
show me one the other day and I was just watching going like,
all right,

730
00:46:40.651 --> 00:46:45.630
well what she's bitching about it isn't on this,
the footage,

731
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.830
it's just her yelling at the guy saying,
why did you do that?

732
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:53.360
You didn't see him do what she's saying that he did and he standard at defendant

733
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.490
himself saying,
I didn't fucking do it,
but it's her video.

734
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.490
So her point of view becomes what happened.

735
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.000
This is getting confusing to me.
Just trying to fucking explain it to you.
Um,

736
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:11.760
anyways.
All right.
28 year old virgin.
Hey Billy,

737
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:16.350
Billy bill blaster.
Uh,
I love the podcast and you're raging sanity.

738
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:21.270
Uh,
I'm going to be honest,
I don't think there's a solution to my problem.
Oh,

739
00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:22.110
come on man.

740
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:27.350
But just hearing you talk about it might help me see it as a so bad.

741
00:47:27.421 --> 00:47:30.580
It's funny kind of situation.
Uh,

742
00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:35.470
I'm a 28 year old virgin and he rides in,
oh Geez.
I'm ugly as shit.

743
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.520
I'll come on man.

744
00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.540
Except even shit has dung beetles that appreciate the aesthetic.
Alright,

745
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.810
so you got a sense of humor.
Self deprecating.

746
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:48.100
I got big ass ears that lie perpendicular to the side of my head.

747
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:52.800
Big Triangle,
nose,
balding island patterns,

748
00:47:52.801 --> 00:47:57.040
small.
Oh,
island of hair on the forehead.
Uh,

749
00:47:57.041 --> 00:48:01.690
with the rest of the hair in a horse shoe pattern.
Very hairy all over.

750
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:04.930
Except my fucking head pointy ass man,

751
00:48:04.931 --> 00:48:09.490
titties with Pepperoni Nipples,
Jesus Christ.

752
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:14.970
And Best of all my genitals alone would send any woman's sprinting towards the

753
00:48:15.221 --> 00:48:19.300
horizon
side from that.
Can't complain.

754
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:26.390
Respectable job.
Good friends,
great family,
bit heavy,
five,
nine,

755
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:31.330
160 pounds.
Dude,
that's not heavy.
Uh,
but otherwise healthy.

756
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.890
Um,
I tried to stay upbeat,
but I,
as I get older,

757
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:39.910
it really starts to weigh on me that I'm destined to live life,

758
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:45.010
uh,
on as a solo player.
Any advice would be appreciated.

759
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.150
Wish you and your family all the best.
Uh,
yeah.
Dude,
come on man.

760
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:51.880
You got to step up to the plate.
All right.
You're,

761
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:55.900
you're saying game over before you even play the game.
All right.

762
00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:57.643
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

763
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.020
<v 0>You have a great sense of humor.</v>

764
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:03.050
I think you're being way too hard on yourself.

765
00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:04.663
<v 2>Uh,</v>

766
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.600
<v 0>the fact that you say you're a bit heavy at five,
nine,
one 60,
uh,
you know,</v>

767
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.830
I think you're being,
you means to me that your prop,
yet you're not heavy,

768
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.190
which means you're probably not nearly as ugly as you're saying.

769
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.270
<v 2>MMM.</v>

770
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.160

772
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:29.023
<v 2>MMM.</v>

773
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:34.730

774
00:49:34.731 --> 00:49:37.220

I'm a 28 year old fucking virgin.
You've got gotta help me out here.

775
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:38.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

776
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.210
<v 0>Maybe that's not the way to go because guys will fucking be like,</v>

777
00:49:41.211 --> 00:49:45.560
try to just find you some,
you know,
loose woman.
That's not,

778
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.120
I don't think that's the way you want to go.

779
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.023
<v 2>MMM.</v>

780
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.410
<v 0>But I,
I,
yeah,
I would just,</v>

781
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.420
you gotta you gotta get up to the plate too.

782
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.870
You got to get up to the plate and you have to stop looking at yourself the way

783
00:49:59.871 --> 00:50:04.070
you look at it yourself.
Um,
you got to keep that great sense of humor,

784
00:50:04.071 --> 00:50:08.510
but you know,
you're not ugly as shit.
Okay,
dude,
look at me.
Okay.

785
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.470
I'm a fucking 50 year old balls,
redheaded male,

786
00:50:12.471 --> 00:50:13.580
and I think I look great.

787
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.480
It's all how you look at yourself.
Okay.
But if you think you look good,

788
00:50:20.481 --> 00:50:21.770
you feel good about yourself,

789
00:50:21.771 --> 00:50:25.700
it's a nice vibe to fucking have and you'll attract people.
All right?

790
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.970
And just your sense

791
00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:32.180
<v 3>that I've been number one thing you got going for yourself is a stipend fact.</v>

792
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:34.970
You still have your whole life ahead of you.
You're only 21 and 28 years old.

793
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:38.600
You got a great sense of humor.
Women love to laugh.
Huh?

794
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.630
How do you think I landed mia?
I made a fucking left.

795
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.990
Sure as hell wasn't comes from my fucking looks.
Um,

796
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.180
I don't know what it was.
Who the fuck knows?
But if she knew 15 years later,

797
00:50:50.181 --> 00:50:53.060
she'd be going to the 24 hours a month.
I don't think she would've gone.

798
00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:57.520
You landed me because I knew about your earning potential.
That's it.
What?

799
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.520
Oh my God.
Hey Nick.
Hey,
just kidding.

800
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.380
Um,
I loved you long before any of this.

801
00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.940
Any of one.
I was making money when you met me.
No,
you weren't.
Yes,
I was.

802
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:18.880
I was on the rich bitch tour.
Right.
But like,
you weren't rich bitch all.

803
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.940
Sorry.
I was doing great anyway.
Yeah.
I never,

804
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:28.250
I never told you.
You never told me.
I didn't ask.
I didn't care.

805
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:32.270
Like it's just,
Oh wow.
It's amazing.
You can just came in here and became a hero.

806
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.290
No.
Hey,
can you help this guy out?
He's a 28 year old virgin.

807
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.750
Ask you about your mind.
You said he's a 28 year old version.
That's fine.

808
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.600
And he goes,
I'm ugly as shit.
Oh.
He goes,

809
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.760
except even shit has dung beetles that appreciate that.
The aesthetic.
Oh Sweetie,

810
00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.100
what do you see?
What you got?
But he's got a great sense of him.
He goes,

811
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:52.610
I've got big ass.
Here's at light.
Perpendicular to the side of my head.

812
00:51:52.611 --> 00:51:57.210
Big Boat as well.
Smith,
big triangle nose.
[inaudible] I know that.

813
00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:01.630
That boy.
Yeah.
What about Adrian Brody,
you like,
Oh yeah,
there you go.

814
00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:06.320
Got a big ass Roman nose.
Balding island pattern.

815
00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:10.520
You know when you've got this circle here with the Horse Shoe,
shave it all off.
A

816
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:16.700
very hairy all over except my fucking head.
He goes pointy ass man.

817
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:18.590
Titties with Pepperoni nipples.

818
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.680
This sounds like Jim Norton wrote this and best of all it goes.

819
00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:26.390
My genitals alone would send any woman's sprinting towards the horizon.
Oh,

820
00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:27.363
got a little one.

821
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

822
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:41.650
<v 3>Wow.
All right.
So what does he do?
That little one.</v>

823
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.800
Listen,
I,
I know they say,
listen,
I know they say that the man makes the gloves,

824
00:52:47.801 --> 00:52:50.380
the gloves.
I'll make the man.
But I feel like,
you know,

825
00:52:50.381 --> 00:52:55.381
maybe the need to shave that head bald like the way bill has it.

826
00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:00.190
So you know,
there's no like trace.
Anytime that horse shoe starts to come back,

827
00:53:00.191 --> 00:53:04.510
you just slap some shaving cream on it and go to town on that bad boy.

828
00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.470
Why do people think know like MMA or some shit?
Watch your back.

829
00:53:08.471 --> 00:53:11.560
Cause that shits nasty.
Just waxing it.
Just boom.
Just deal with it.

830
00:53:11.561 --> 00:53:15.910
You'll be fine.
Um,
a lot of these already.

831
00:53:15.911 --> 00:53:20.650
60% better looking right there.
Yeah.
Go.
You know,
get,
go to the gym,
you'll feel,

832
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:24.970
nevermind.
Five,
nine,
one six.
He said,
he says,
he goes,

833
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:29.940
I'm a bit heavy.
Five,
960 doesn't sound big to me.

834
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.360
That sounds maybe or deli,

835
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:39.270
maybe your fleshy.
Lashey maybe you're skinny fat like you're not,

836
00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:44.060
you don't have any tone in your body.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not My temple,
not my son ball.

837
00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:49.170
So here's what he does.
He shaved his head,
shaved his head for he gets shredded.

838
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:53.520
No,
for the women she had get shredded itself cause they'll feel better about

839
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:57.840
himself.
Just even going to the gym.
You'll make himself feel better.
I mean,

840
00:53:57.841 --> 00:53:59.310
I don't know what to do about your Dick size.

841
00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.980
I mean I hope your ETL game is strong because,

842
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:06.270
so what if he had like a 12 pack apps you get with the guy 12 pack abs.

843
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:10.820
Well APEC would of Apac.
ABS is necessary.
You don't need to know.
Wait,

844
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:15.630
can you let me finish with the scenario eight pack abs that you kissed down.

845
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:19.620
That leads to is a little fella down there.
Are you?

846
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:24.630
You'd be less disappointed if he had the little fucking xylophone above it,

847
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:27.990
but you go to who didn't grow up on the scene.
It was certainly help.

848
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:32.070
Maybe you should also like cut down your pubes so your Dick looks bigger

849
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.700
but he doesn't need his dick is in small.

850
00:54:38.701 --> 00:54:42.390
He five nine one 60 Pete fucking thinks he's fat.
I bet his dick is fine.

851
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:46.230
I don't know.
He says it small.

852
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:50.820
So listen,
some guys aren't blessed and that's fine.

853
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.640
That's why I'm saying your ETL gained better.
Be Strong.
You eat out game,

854
00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:58.350
you're fingering game,
all that stuff.
Ass eating,
whatever.
Just

855
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:04.560
I don't know what,
I don't even know who you are right now.

856
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.490
Don't tell him he needs to get a 12 pack left.

857
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:13.200
Too intimidating and just go to the gym.

858
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.320
Like not everybody has to have washboard abs.
I've just,

859
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:21.890
you just fucking told this guy that you know all of these fucking skills,

860
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.320
like when you first get laid all you know,

861
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.620
and now you're doing all these fucking,
you know,
next level move.

862
00:55:29.621 --> 00:55:31.760
So those are all next level moves,
right?
Oh and act out.

863
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:35.040
I wouldn't say fingering though.
Yeah,
that,
that's a pre,
that's the prequel.

864
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.550
That's like the third star wars.
Right?
Listen,

865
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:42.720
as long as he knows where the clit is,
he'll be fine.
Right?

866
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.140
Yeah.
I would think with videos and shit and all,
everything on the Internet,

867
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:49.560
I think it'd be fine.
But don't use porn as a guy and a point like,

868
00:55:49.561 --> 00:55:52.030
I just feel like Warren in guys up because like you are,

869
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.580
I'm not saying to use porn.
So should he go to a
dot.

870
00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:00.690
Clinton signs?
Quick Binder,
clip finder?

871
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:03.450
Uh,
no.

872
00:56:03.451 --> 00:56:08.451
This is where you save your money and you get a nice professional woman who can

873
00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:14.220
like help you with all of that.
That's not the ideal way to lose your virginity.

874
00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:18.860
But yeah.
Are you saying to get a hooker and escort,

875
00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.890
you know,
hooker and an escort?
I Dunno really.

876
00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:27.810
But escort sounds nice chance of STD.
Well,
I mean,
you know,

877
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:30.780
the escorts have like websites and stuff

878
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.990
on Venmo.
It's not like cash.
I mean,
cash is preferred

879
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:41.710
<v 0>outside.</v>

880
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.080
Like those people when they try and get you to go into the place to get your

881
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:46.120
taxes done out there,
flipping the signs around.

882
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.180
<v 3>Okay.
Not that I have a problem with the street hookers either listen,</v>

883
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.910
dad do what you gotta do.
Uh,

884
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.440
but he just needs a little guidance and low self esteem.
I don't know.

885
00:56:57.441 --> 00:57:00.320
I feel like this is weird because it's like I'm promoting prostitution.

886
00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.030
<v 0>Yeah.
I think what I said was a little more positive.</v>

887
00:57:03.031 --> 00:57:06.660
I said go on dating sites and stuff like that and you can use your sense of

888
00:57:06.661 --> 00:57:11.130
humor.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
The escorts.
Escorts.
I'm sorry.

889
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:17.450
<v 3>No,
because I,
you know,
feel like sex workers are fine and whatever.
Um,</v>

890
00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:23.480
yeah.
But what's this question?
He wants to get laid.
Oh,
he wants,

891
00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:28.130
he doesn't want to go through life alone.
Of course.
None of us do.

892
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:37.290
My suggestions.
Like what more,
what more what?
You know,
nothing.

893
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.130
<v 0>Nothing.
You want to do the last one here.
You were on a roll.
Here you go.</v>

894
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:44.340
You're fucking killing it.
And there's this whole level of coldness to you today.

895
00:57:44.341 --> 00:57:45.180
That's really funny.

896
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:49.080
<v 3>We talked about that last night.
Oh yeah.
Uh,</v>

897
00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:52.900
<v 0>what do you,
what are you over you over the podcast or something?</v>

898
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:58.100
<v 3>No,
no,
no.
Oh,
but no,
it just might coldness.
It's just like,</v>

899
00:57:58.101 --> 00:57:59.780
you know what I have to do to survive.

900
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.250
It's called world baby.

901
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:08.910
<v 0>All right.
Mr Friend's mom is a Seiko.
Mr Friends,</v>

902
00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.540
this sounds like a TV show.
Mr Friend's mom is a psycho.
Ah,

903
00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:14.191
dear bill,

904
00:58:14.191 --> 00:58:18.060
I have a friend who's been getting grounded a lot recently for the dumbest shit.

905
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:21.850
<v 3>Does that mean my friend's mom?
Not Mr friend's mom</v>

906
00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.940
<v 0>probably,
but I liked Mr friend's mom better.</v>

907
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.450
All my friends have known for a while that his mom was a psycho,

908
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:32.110
but now it's getting way worse.
First he got grounded for a month.

909
00:58:32.111 --> 00:58:33.540
How old is this person?
Yeah,

910
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:37.510
I was gonna say it wasn't allowed to leave the house outside of school at all

911
00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:42.130
because he got a 70 on one test.
His grades are good,
not great,

912
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.220
but better than 70% of the kids at my school.

913
00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.500
<v 3>Um,
now,</v>

914
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:50.050
<v 0>just this past week,</v>

915
00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:54.610
he got grounded for the entire summer for using his laptop to text when he

916
00:58:54.611 --> 00:58:58.600
wasn't supposed to be able to communicate with anybody outside the house when

917
00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:03.100
he's not in school.
He's 16 years old,
by the way.
Is there anything I could do,

918
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:06.970
could or should do to help him or should I just leave it alone?

919
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.790
<v 3>You got to leave it alone.
Yeah.
You're not the parent,</v>

920
00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:13.940
just be his friend and just commiserate with him.
How nick,

921
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.650
he's grounded for the whole summer down.

922
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:21.680
He can't leave the house or like anything like that.
No.

923
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:26.750
I know what I would do,
but I'm not giving a minor advice.
Exactly.

924
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:31.660
That's probably,
yeah.
I'm going to stay away from this one.
Moving on.
By the way,

925
00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:35.740
70% is not acceptable on a test.

926
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.630
He didn't see.
He said his grades are good.
They're not great.

927
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:42.830
He's kind of agreeing with you.
Yeah.
He's just saying this not justification.

928
00:59:42.831 --> 00:59:44.870
One text message,
you can't go off the whole summer.

929
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.520
He know about parenting or any of that stuff.
You're too young.

930
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:53.550
Do you think so you think that's a fair getting on?

931
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.970
We've got a 70 on a test to ground them.
No,

932
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:59.330
I don't communicate with your friends outside of school and then he sent one

933
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:03.390
text message or whatever and now he can't go off for the whole summer.

934
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.450
That's definitely extreme.
I don't think that I would parent like that,

935
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.970
but that's not my kid and I don't know what else he's doing.

936
01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:15.060
I also don't know if it was just one text he sent one text.
Yeah.

937
01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.110
What was the text about?
We're leaving that alone.

938
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.690
What does it say?
I'm going to stop one minute and 26 27 okay.

939
01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:29.540
That's one hour.
One hour and 20 you think we'd done a minute?

940
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:34.580
We did a minute on this podcast and wrap it up.
Okay.
What a minute you said.

941
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:39.500
I said how much time have I done?
You said one minute.
One hour.
Okay,
cool.
Um,

942
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:42.770
all right,
well that's the,
yeah,
that's the podcast.
Knee.

943
01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.360
I've had such a wonderful time here with you.

944
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.670
This is our place and that's right.
That's right.

945
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.720
And then we got to bring the baby.
Like how special is that?

946
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:57.230
I told you I was in the kitchen and I was like cleaning up and I was looking

947
01:00:57.231 --> 01:01:02.020
over at her playing in the living room and I was like,
no,

948
01:01:02.021 --> 01:01:03.200
I was making your dinner.
I was like,

949
01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:07.850
I'm making dinner for my little baby girl and parent,
like just,
it's so special.

950
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:12.440
So I'll cool it when she says a French word.
Oh my God.
Say We'd,
she goes,

951
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:16.470
we lead irritated or when she says,
uh,
say thanks.

952
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:20.270
Yeah,
she nods her head.

953
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:24.260
She asked for food.
You Go,
what are you saying?
She goes,

954
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.730
and then he'd give it to you.
Now you're saying,
she goes,

955
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:33.440
she nods her whole head like a bad commercial for the 1950s.

956
01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:36.980
It's the cutest thing ever.
Anyways.
Um,
that's it.

957
01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:42.500
A messy,
bold,
cool,
messy book.
Cool.

958
01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:46.800
Petty was blah bone.

959
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:49.460
We had a great time.
And,
uh,
that's it.

960
01:01:49.461 --> 01:01:53.450
