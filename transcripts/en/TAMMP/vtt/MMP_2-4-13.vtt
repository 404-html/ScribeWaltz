00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.460
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:10.140
February 4th,
2013 what's going on?

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.040
How are you?
Congratulations to the Buffalo Ravens.

4
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:18.960
My condolences to the fans of the San Francisco 40.
Niners.

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.890
What a fucking game.
Huh?
What a GS is cheeky.

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.880
Can you believe that game?
Why does it sound like I'm in a Tin Cup this week?

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.230
Um,
you know,
it's funny,
I actually won money on that.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.260
I totally flipped and bet the Ravens I was sitting there,

9
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:37.930
uh,
you know,

10
00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:41.370
I remember all this shit I talked about last week about how you watched the game

11
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:46.080
and this is what you should do and fuck all this and fuck all that,
you know,

12
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.240
let the game go for 90 minutes and all that.

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.520
We'll basically half the reason why I was doing that was because,
um,

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.090
I was actually working,
um,
on Superbowl Sunday,

15
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.750
the Sunday of the Superbowl Superbowl Sunday.

16
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.230
I'm so fucking sick of that shit.

17
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.250
So I didn't think I was going to see the game anyways.

18
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.630
And by the time I got home,

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
knee was already gonna be off to a party or whatever and then,
uh,
you know,

20
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:17.580
I be 90 minutes in or whatever and I could just start it and do everything that

21
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:18.750
I said I was going to do.
Well,

22
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.780
we wrapped early and all of a sudden I'm driving home and I pull in and I don't

23
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.560
see the car and I'm thinking,
oh shit,
she already left.
Well,
fuck it.

24
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:29.970
Then I'll just stick with my plan.

25
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.090
And then I walked into the house and then the dog wasn't there and I realized

26
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.370
that she had taken the dog and they went on some hike or something.

27
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.000
Then she comes back and she's like,
oh,
your home.

28
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.850
Well,
do you want to go to the,
you know,
what am I going to say?
No,

29
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.220
no,
fuck you leave,

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.120
you go to the party and I'm going to sit here like the old curmudgeon than I am

31
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:51.954
now.
Pardon me?

32
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.590
Actually wanted to go to a Superbowl party because I was a lady that I got out

33
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:59.010
of work early.
You know what I mean?
I feel like a kid,

34
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.130
like he had a half day at school and if you're so fucking dumb you forgot you

35
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.970
did.
So I was in more of a social mood,
so I was like,
all right,
fuck it,
I'll go.

36
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.321
But uh,

37
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:12.321
I didn't have a dog in the fight so I just decided to just say fuck it.

38
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.260
All right.
So I went onto Twitter and I basically,
I wrote a

39
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.830
cause,
you know,
you know what you mean when you're just watching the game,

40
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:24.630
your team isn't in it.
It's going to be boring.

41
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:26.790
You've got to get some sort of action on the game.
So it was like,

42
00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:27.331
I don't want to do,

43
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:32.331
I'm going to talk shit on Twitter and I'm either going to be 100% right or I'm

44
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.730
going to be 100% wrong.
But either way people are going to react to it.

45
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:39.780
So I just wrote,
Ravens will win f what you think you know?
No that,

46
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.670
I know what you don't shut your face.
Put your money down.

47
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:46.110
Thank,
thank me later.

48
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.800
That's when I wrote to figure it immediately.

49
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.880
I'm going to get a ton of shit from 49 are fans and people who got shit on the,

50
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.240
on the fucking 49 hours,
you know,
just to add some excitement to the day,

51
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.460
you know,
that's my little world.

52
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.470
If I'm not getting trashed on Twitter and I'm sitting,
I'm bored.
So,

53
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.590
um,
then I'm just sitting there.
All right,

54
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.780
so now I've got people yelling at me on Twitter.
Okay,

55
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:13.660
that's getting the blood going here.
Now what else can I do?
I'm like,
I know.

56
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.680
Fuck this.
I'm texting Versie and Keith Robinson and I just,

57
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.280
I just texted him.
I just wrote,
Ravens will win today.

58
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.660
<v 1>Okay,</v>

59
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.720
<v 0>let me see.
I got to show you the shit that I wrote to versa.
He so fucking,</v>

60
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.850
he's so like dejected right now cause you know he loves calling shit.

61
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.060
I texted him,
I'm going to read you these texts right here.

62
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.680
I wrote Ravens when today straight up,
25 bucks.
He writes back,

63
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.510
you're hilarious.
Let's be,
let's be men and go 50.
Just kidding.
25 is cool,

64
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:48.160
confirmed and I said 50 confirmed and he goes nice.
And he goes,

65
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.490
I think something weird is going to happen.
I don't know what that means,

66
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.860
but something crazy happens in this game.

67
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.550
And then I wrote classic Versie Superbowl prediction.

68
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.360
I got a feel and something weird is going to happen.
That's like bedding,

69
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:05.800
every number in roulette.
I'm just saying how he's just throwing that out there.

70
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.240
You know I got it.
This,

71
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.170
there's just something's gonna I got a feeling something's going to happen.

72
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.330
Um,
anyway,
so I just wrote capital letters.
Raven's when,
no,

73
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.890
no feeling.
Just the facts.
So then he goes,
Raymond's are not as good.

74
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:24.910
49 is have better personnel.
I'm saying,
cause I had to get them to commit.

75
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.290
It goes.
I'm saying there's going to be frank,
uh,

76
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.020
of Franco Harris play on this game.
Something nuts happens.
Got a feeling.

77
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.410
Okay.
And he still hit me with the dude.
I called it.

78
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.190
I told you something weird was going to happen.
Oh,
he drives me nuts.

79
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.010
You thought it was going to be human being weird shit.

80
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:44.320
You didn't think it was going to be the fucking matrix.

81
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.970
Goddamn fucking lights going out.
So anyways,
I said,

82
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.130
take everything you think you know about football.

83
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.600
Take it outside and throw it in the trash.
Joe Flacco coming of age game today,

84
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.010
he'll be one and done.
Just like Trent Dilfer,
perfectly bookending ray Lewis,

85
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:00.844
his career.

86
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.710
Randy Moss will retire ringless and we'll take it out on a meter maid.
He goes,

87
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:10.120
no way.
Mohs already said he's coming back.
49 is love him.
He's a model citizen.

88
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:14.770
Ma Ma's catches TD pass and game today you starting to get stale,

89
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.470
bur you football philosophies getting old.

90
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:22.180
The game is passing you by parentheses,
Don Shula.
Things Change Dude,
lol.

91
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.110
And I said,
I'll take don shool over B and Jerry Glanville,
you're all talking.

92
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.750
No results.
You couldn't pick a winner if I gave you tomorrow's paper,

93
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:31.930
you're a bum.
Versie so now we're just talking shit.
All right,

94
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.210
so now he starts naming all the shit that he did back in the day and I'm like,

95
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.280
ah,
you have,
you'll lose so much.
You catch phrases.

96
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.130
I'm back and I'm trashing of where the fuck is this year.

97
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.933
<v 1>Okay,</v>

98
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.540
<v 0>submit your retirement papers and begin your broadcasting career.
All.</v>

99
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.140
He actually laughed at that one.
I said,
fuck off.

100
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.320
And then I set my brain and money's say Raven's hearts weren't 40 niners and he

101
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:00.800
goes,
better teams,
40 nice win this game.
I said,
it's going to be great.

102
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.960
FLACCO's experience might be the difference.

103
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:06.630
I think Kaepernick is going to throw a pick late in the game.
All right.

104
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.090
And he said Mazda is going to do something.

105
00:06:09.091 --> 00:06:14.070
I said Mohs is like an old super model.
All right?
So the fucking game unfolds.

106
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.680
Every fucking thing that I said is happening and I'm ready to rub it in this

107
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:22.900
dude's face and then the fucking ravens.

108
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.060
<v 0>The fucking Baltimore Ravens.</v>

110
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.630
Arguably the Domus call in Superbowl history since bill Belicheck went for it on

111
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.620
fourth and eight on the giants,
45 I think,

112
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:40.190
or something in the first quarter in 2007.

113
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.343
Um,

114
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.330
when they didn't just kick the field goal and they had that stupid rookie,
hey,

115
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.700
run with the fucking ball.
Jesus fucking Christ.

116
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.240
I actually have an all cat.
I'm just gonna read you all my tweets for the game.

117
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.450
All capital letters.
I say dumb has played in super bowl history.

118
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:03.680
Kicked a field goal.
I couldn't fucking believe it.
Why would you do that?

119
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.000
You know you got your foot on their fucking throat.

120
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:11.310
Just kick the Goddamn feel.
Go.
Don't give him any hope.

121
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.900
Don't have that fun.
You don't have your kicker

122
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.690
go on her shouldn't even wear uniforms.

123
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.990
They should just go out there and pajamas one slipper in one cleat.
Right.

124
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.030
You sitting there,
everybody out there,
it's got some sort of injury.

125
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.520
You know you've got fucking deer antler juice in your veins just trying to get

126
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:39.521
through a fucking NFL season and you risk the entire tape fucking season.

127
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.510
<v 0>On,
on a,
on a,
a naked bootleg by your fucking kicker.</v>

129
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.620
Oh my God.
I lost my shit at the Super Bowl party by the way.

130
00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:52.210
I went to a great Superbowl party that,

131
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.480
that convinced me that you could watch it in live time.

132
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.480
Cause this dude had one TV for people who wanted to Yap.

133
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.080
And he had another one for everybody.
Shut the fuck up.

134
00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:04.470
We're in the war room was great.
Um,

135
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.660
so anyways.

136
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.440
<v 0>Then what,
how,
what happened?
The 40 niners went down.
I was drinking a Budweiser,</v>

138
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.990
so I'm trying to remember.
They went down and now,

139
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.650
now it's 14 to fucking six and I'm like morons.

140
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.500
And then I texted Rosie.
I said,
by the way,

141
00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:23.170
everything that I said was going to happen has happened.
He goes,
I know it's,

142
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.430
it's killing me.
And then inexplicably,

143
00:08:26.431 --> 00:08:28.500
I dunno what the fucking 40 niners did.

144
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:32.030
They let a guy go thinking the safety was going to pick him up.
You saw the game.

145
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.770
It's pathetic.
I loved it because I had money on it,

146
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:40.910
but that was fucking pathetic.
Guy Catches a ball,
falls down,
gets back up.

147
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:44.210
Keystone cops,
nobody can tackle him.
The guy goes in for a fucking touchdown.

148
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:47.550
So I write what the fuck.
And then verse,
he just writes Europe.
Accountant.

149
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.283
<v 2>Okay.</v>

150
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.220
<v 0>So now I'm loving life because I would Versie on this.
Now I never talked.</v>

151
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.570
I mean I talk shit on the podcast,

152
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.480
but I never before the game say without a doubt somebody is gonna fucking win.

153
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:04.260
I just felt like doing it just cause I,
I was,
I,
like I said,

154
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:06.060
my team lost that was going to have any excitement.

155
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:09.180
So I figured out either be getting trashed or I could trash somebody else,

156
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.550
which is really the greatest thing about talking shit.

157
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.570
So the fucking halftime show,

158
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.140
I mean it's so super bowls,
so fucking ridiculous.

159
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.900
It's like spinal tap at this point.
The fucking pomp and circumstance.

160
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:26.730
If I'm using that,
that expression correctly,

161
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:31.731
how all the extra shit that is going on the NBA for as much as they blow their

162
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:37.710
fans every 20 minutes,
they don't even do that.
You don't have a game seven,

163
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.760
you know,
and then there's,
you know,
in the middle of it,

164
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:44.550
all of a sudden it turns into a fucking Broadway musical.

165
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.080
You just see all those fans like running by.
Yeah,

166
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.520
by the camera doing that.

167
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:55.521
I know how to dance run or you run with your Chin beyond your fucking toes and

168
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.580
your hands are like drafting behind you.
Ooh,

169
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.450
run out on the fucking grid iron.
Oh,

170
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:07.890
it's fucking horrific.
And smoke machines and all that shit.

171
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.850
I got to say something.

172
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:11.940
I love that Beyonce got caught lip syncing because it was great to just see her

173
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:14.250
just go out and sing the fucking song.
You can sing.

174
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.210
She got a little out of breath a couple of times,
but it worked.
You know

175
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:20.701
she came out there.

176
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:25.170
You know what the fucking half our goods hanging out as they all do.
As they say,

177
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:26.880
hang on.
You know one side of their mouth.

178
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.470
Don't objectify a stop you got,
it's like we're objects.

179
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:35.670
The facts.
Right.
And then look at them when they can call the shots.

180
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.710
Did they go out?
Do they ever,
do they ever dress elegant?

181
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.440
No,
they don't.
Tits out.

182
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.670
Fucking hoo ha hanging out the he a fucking leather shorts.

183
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.780
You know that dumb ass walk she's doing web who were being weapon web damn

184
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:57.870
fucking ass cheeks hitting people in the front row.
The fuck are you doing?

185
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.280
But anyways,
that's not my world.
Some people like that.

186
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:05.370
I thought Alicia keys was really classy.
You know,

187
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.170
she sat there,
she actually had a Jerry Glanville haircut.

188
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.860
Oh is that Wade Phillips?
She was doing something.

189
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:21.390
She was doing some sort of tribute.
Um,
I'm just fucking with you.

190
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.850
She had a conch,
I think that that's what that was called.

191
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.870
Salt peanuts sell peanuts.
Um,
anyways,

192
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.940
it was a bebop reference with fucking song was that and was way back in the day.

193
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.980
It happened to him.
Let him sell peanuts.
So Penis,
sorry.
Anyways,
plowing ahead.

194
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.490
So then the second half starts and I'm still a little nervous going.

195
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.930
I didn't like that fucking shit.
Right.

196
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:46.920
They run the ball back first play of the game.

197
00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:49.920
That was another reason why it was done for them not to take the fucking points.

198
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.010
It's like you get the ball back.
Okay.

199
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.260
You getting the ball back to open the second half.
Just take the fucking points.

200
00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.103
I swear to God,

201
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.550
John Madden projectile vomited when they fucking roll that thing out.

202
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.950
Puked up like nine Turkey legs.

203
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.170
He's the guy who actually eats a Turkey every year,
by the way.

204
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.800
The thanksgiving Turkey.
All right.
A little known fact.

205
00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:13.650
That's not even a Wikipedia yet.
All right.
Someone has put up there.

206
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.580
Just know that it came from this podcast.
Okay.
All right.

207
00:12:17.581 --> 00:12:21.210
So then they run the fucking ball back and [inaudible] he just goes,

208
00:12:21.211 --> 00:12:24.120
congratulations.
He calls it says games over and I write,

209
00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:26.940
I go to early to worldly.

210
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:29.510
I hate when a team goes up big like that because then it kind of like,
hey,

211
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.160
let's fucking chill out.
You know,
kick our cleats off.

212
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.710
The other team always seems to come back nowadays.
Right.

213
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.290
And then the fucking power goes out.

214
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.290
Why am I talking to you guys like this?
Like you miss the game.

215
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.350
The fucking power goes out.

216
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

217
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.750
<v 0>One of the greatest breaks I've ever seen a team get,</v>

218
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.050
and I know like 49 are friends were like,
well,

219
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:56.110
you know the ravens got to regroup to,
they didn't need to regroup.

220
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.440
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

221
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.060
<v 0>they had you on the ropes live a shot upper cut all the hand,
right.</v>

222
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.180
Fucking your mouth pieces flying in the front row and you get a half hour time

223
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:08.570
out.
You got another halftime.

224
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:10.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.150
<v 0>To get dead.
Zombie.
Holy fucking shell shocked.
Look off your face.</v>

226
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:16.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

227
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.160
<v 0>By the time the fucking game starts up again.</v>

228
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.700
That was brutal because then he had to listen to more Shannon Sharpe,

229
00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:27.320
who I swear to God,
I don't get that guy at all.
When he was a player,

230
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.480
I could understand every word that he said.

231
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.170
He spoke more clearly before we started broadcasting.
Can anybody explain that?

232
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.420
I'm one of the Broncos beat us and he did that whole funny riff about,
you know,

233
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.810
call the fucking Pentagon because the Patriot missiles,

234
00:13:41.811 --> 00:13:43.940
I forget what I understood every word.

235
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.120
I didn't enjoy it cause he was shitting on my team,
but I can understand them.

236
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.000
And ever since he started announcing,

237
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.450
I can't understand a fucking word that guy say that should be a drinking game.

238
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:55.830
<v 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.320
<v 0>No,
can't be a drinking game cause you don't know me.</v>

240
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.480
Every time he says [inaudible] you got to fucking do a shot.

241
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.600
<v 0>He literally sounds like that job in baby good.
I can't,</v>

243
00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:08.670
I can't understand a fucking word he's saying.

244
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

245
00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.290
<v 0>And you sit sitting there drunk trying to figure it out.
And he's sitting,</v>

246
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.110
he still lifts too.
So he's bulging out of his pinstripe suit.
[inaudible],

247
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.840
I don't know.
Anyways,

248
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.540
broadcaster broadcaster and you can understand a fucking word you say and it's

249
00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:32.000
unreal on fucking real.
So anyways,

250
00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:36.230
he's back doing his shit and I thought,
by the way,

251
00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:40.220
I thought everybody did a phenomenal job because that nobody knew that that was

252
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:45.050
coming back and all of a sudden all these guys have to fucking talk for a half

253
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.820
an hour.
And I swear to God if they ever put that Superbowl out on DVD,

254
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.540
I want see the screaming and yelling that was going on in the control room.

255
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.860
You know,
I want to see the whole build,
like the lights go out.

256
00:15:01.861 --> 00:15:05.240
I just wanna hear that.
Well what the fuck's going on?
Okay,
we got a problem here.

257
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:06.960
If we got prompt with vector vector,
mayday,

258
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.980
whatever fucking military shit that they're using in there till like all the way

259
00:15:10.981 --> 00:15:14.400
to the build where they're like seven excruciating minutes in,

260
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.650
whether it's just some guy and I doing that,

261
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.700
just fucking losing his shit.
Fuck it.
Switch this.

262
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.950
Absolutely.
Or did they keep their cool is beads of sweat.

263
00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:32.340
I just pictured it like NASA with all those guys with like their short sleeve

264
00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:37.110
dress shirts.
You know what to do during an emergency.

265
00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:38.250
You keep,
you stay calm.

266
00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:41.010
You think it was like that or somebody had to have been flipping out

267
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.210
somebody in a suit through a phone,
something happened.

268
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.810
Somebody,
you know what?
I bet whoever really runs the NFL,

269
00:15:51.811 --> 00:15:56.340
he's upstairs in his villa.
He's got one of those long winding staircases.

270
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.910
I bet he came bursting out of a fucking bedroom trying to throw a robot.

271
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.040
You know his real wife downstairs,
a couple of hookers up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up.

272
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:09.590
I'll coming down the stairs.
I honey,
what's wrong?

273
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:14.420
And he just runs right out the fucking front door and his God damn robe dives in

274
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:17.690
his Bentley and just starts driving to the fucking electric company.

275
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:18.524
Something happened.

276
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.170
Then he weighs 49 is get a fucking half hour time out to fucking a half hours

277
00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:30.530
standing.
Eight count,
never seen anything like it

278
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.530
and the whole fucking game just turns

279
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:41.730
unreal.
Fucking unbelievable.
Then all of a sudden they score two quick ones.

280
00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:46.660
The game was,
I ain't never seen a game like it.
Never seen a game like that.

281
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:51.400
But in the end,
I know and I know a lot of 49 his fans are bitching,
you know,

282
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:55.960
cause the dude held at receiver and he did hold that receiver.
All right.

283
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.800
But they also gave you guys a do over on a f on that field goal,

284
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:02.500
that roughing the kicker call was fucking horse shit.

285
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.790
That guy missed it and I swear to God,

286
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.820
Scott Norwood was probably relieved.
Good.

287
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:13.060
Somebody else they can yell at and then he does that fucking dramatic dive and

288
00:17:13.061 --> 00:17:16.180
he's like,
fuck,
that's what I should have done.
Did you see that?

289
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.540
He kicks the ball.
He's totally threw his whole motion and all that.

290
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:21.250
And I know you can't touch the kicker at all.

291
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.060
I think that guy grazed his Achilles tendon,
not both of them,

292
00:17:25.061 --> 00:17:28.120
just one and he fucking collapsed.

293
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.240
Like he fainted.
I think he faded.

294
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.610
I don't even think he was hit and they get to do it over.

295
00:17:33.611 --> 00:17:38.470
So I don't know as much as you know,

296
00:17:38.471 --> 00:17:40.330
I think that receive on that receiving play,

297
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:44.410
whatever that that could have gone either way.
That's one of those borderline,

298
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.760
yes he held him.
But if they gave you first and fucking goal,

299
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.550
you four downs to punch it in,
you couldn't and you got a half hour standing,

300
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:57.420
eight count and your team went to,
you know,

301
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.140
your team went down 28 to six,
she did it to yourself.

302
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.350
So I dunno,
I'm not trying to fucking give you,
I am actually,

303
00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:09.130
I guess I'm kind of giving you shit,
but I'm not trying to do that because uh,

304
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.080
whatever.
I think the 49 is a great,
I think Catherine Hicks,

305
00:18:12.081 --> 00:18:14.090
the future I tell on you right now.

306
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.130
Joe Flacco is one and done one and done

307
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.780
one and done.
He's got his one ring.
That's it.
And then in the end,
which is great,

308
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.920
good for him.
And in the end when they have this,

309
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.510
they have to like to the reunion of Superbowl winners.

310
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.910
You know when they got the big boy table,

311
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.260
the guys with more than one eli sitting there,
given Tom Brady shit a,

312
00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:41.220
I got you twice a fuck you one three.
Yeah,
but it got you twice.

313
00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:46.200
Don Brady's dimple starts sweating.
You know Terry Bradshaw,
Joe Montana,

314
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:48.180
this sitting down and the little,
the little table,

315
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.590
the fucking Peyton manning table,
there'll be sitting,
it's fucking goddamn

316
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.040
pencil heads sticking through the ceiling.
Joe Flacco is going to be there.

317
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.500
Take Man's going to be there.
Trent Dilfer is going to be there.

318
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:04.380
That guy from whoever the fuck quarterback,
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,

319
00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:06.510
they're all going to be sitting there.
You know,

320
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.870
Len Dawson is going to be sitting there going,
wow,
why did I do shy?

321
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:12.853
<v 2>MMM.</v>

322
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.010
<v 0>I'm just fucking around.
It was an unbelievable game.
And um,
I don't know.</v>

323
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.590
I'm glad I won money.
So then,
okay,
so then the game's over.
So now I won.

324
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.240
So now I got to talk shit.
Right?
So I call up VRC.

325
00:19:29.241 --> 00:19:32.340
If I really been talking about this for 20 minutes,
I fucking,
uh,

326
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.560
I called fuzzy up.

327
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.940
He doesn't pick up and I leave him a message and say that he has a one game

328
00:19:38.941 --> 00:19:39.774
suspension.

329
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.370
He's not allowed to call me for 24 hours because of his awful Superbowl

330
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:45.204
prediction.

331
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.160
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

332
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.990
<v 0>I know I'm a con,
but you know what,</v>

333
00:19:49.991 --> 00:19:54.200
he ended up calling me back and we were laughing about it.
So,
uh,
uh,

334
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:59.230
it's fucking great.
I love it.
I out dude.
I called it Paul Versey.

335
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.060
Is there anything better than that

336
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.640
that just fucking beaten somebody at like what they do?
You know what I mean?

337
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:13.040
It's like a,
I don't know,
pick somebody catch phrase who says,

338
00:20:13.041 --> 00:20:17.640
oh no you did it.
It's like you say it better than they say it.
Um,

339
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.480
all right.
Advertising for this week everybody.
Hey,

Guess what?

340
00:20:22.481 --> 00:20:26.810
Everybody Valentine's Day's coming up
right here.

341
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.650
It's the pressure.

Her friends are going to ask.

So what did he get you for Valentine's Day and press your woman and her friends

346
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.750
is probably even more important to impress their friends.
Look at pro flowers.

347
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.490
Just hitting the nail on the head.

348
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.440
Sandra Flowers from pro flowers and shut her friends up.

349
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.140
Um,

this is,
this is the easiest thing ever.
You should do it right now.

350

You know what you do,
dude?

354
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:26.041
You send it to a work they love that show you love in front of everybody up and

355
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:29.590
shut up all those other broads and all the other cubicles.

356
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.060
They'll peek over and see it and then sadly,
oh,
so nice.

357
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:37.870
And then sadly sink back down behind their cubicle wall.
That's what,

358
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:42.170
you know what?
No woman's going to feel great.
Um,

359
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.870
rub it in their face on Valentine's Day.

362
00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:59.390

doubled down,

363
00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:04.030
split says it's going to cost you less than 30 bucks.

378
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.010
Go out and enjoy yourself.
Okay.
If you,

398
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:07.880

You know,
who could have used that?
The NFL when the power went out,

399
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.950
they definitely could have needed 94 person conference call.
Um,

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:15.080
it all starts for less than $10 per month,

411
00:24:51.921 --> 00:24:54.440

So anyways,
I watched a bunch of,

417
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:19.730
uh,
I watched a bunch of crazy shit this week.
You know,
I finally,

418
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:24.050
I got the center ice package and I've been loving life.
This,
you know,

419
00:25:24.051 --> 00:25:24.884
it's underrated.

420
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.570
The sport you love going on strike for half a season and then trying to cram as

421
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:33.920
many games in as they possibly can for the rest of the season.

422
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:39.710
As a fan,
you love in life,
back to back nights.
My Bruins are on for them.

423
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:42.860
It sucks.
You know,
they life stinks.

424
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.970
My life is a fan where I have to sit there and not exert myself other than

425
00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:50.630
walking back and forth to the fridge is tremendous.

426
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:55.460
Um,
been watching the Bruins all week.
We've been playing great,

427
00:25:55.461 --> 00:25:58.100
except when we played the savers,
they made us look like fools,
man.

428
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.420
They won like every facet of the game.
And they even won the fight.

429
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:08.450
And Sean Thornton fought this guy,
John Scott,
and he got a concussion,

430
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:12.520
was brutal because I love Sean Thornton because even though he's an,

431
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.460
he's an enforcer,
he's not,
he's not a dirty player.
He's one of those guys,

432
00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:18.440
if he knocked shut down and you're on your way down to the ice,

433
00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:22.940
he doesn't throw that extra one,
you know?
And uh,

434
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.820
so when he was,
he fights this guy and the guy,

435
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.850
he's basically rain in punches down on them.
It's the,

436
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.610
most of them are hidden his helmet and he's fine until the end.

437
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:35.540
He takes his brutal upper cut.
So I looked at,

438
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:40.370
I looked it up.
Sean Thornton is six,
two,
two 20.
He fights this guy,

439
00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:43.350
John Scott,
the guy,
six,
eight to 70.

440
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.130
He's given away half a foot in 50 pounds.

441
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.890
And I'm just like these guys,

442
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.960
it's no wonder,
I remember like reading this stuff,
you know,

443
00:26:56.961 --> 00:27:01.961
like when you know Boogaard died and everything and they start talking about the

444
00:27:02.511 --> 00:27:07.280
uh,
you know,
the,
the concussions and all the shit that these guys get any,

445
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.630
I don't know,
as a hockey fan and you just don't,

446
00:27:08.631 --> 00:27:10.460
for some reason you just don't think about it.

447
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.060
Cause he enforces like a superhero.

448
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:17.810
He's like the guy you always wanted to be like guy who will fight anybody,

449
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.320
you know,
not scared of anything.
You know,

450
00:27:21.321 --> 00:27:25.220
you kind of like live vicariously through them if you're like a pussy like me,

451
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.090
you know.
So I just started looking at these,
these guys up,

452
00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.620
the top fighter last year in the Nhl had 20 fights,

453
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.130
20 fights.

454
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.690
The season is six months long for four weeks in a month.
That's 24 weeks.

455
00:27:41.691 --> 00:27:46.640
This guy had 20 bare knuckle fist fights.
I mean that,

456
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.990
that's,
that's fucking unreal.

457
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.870
That's half a boxer's career career in six months.

458
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.080
I don't believe these.
They're like,
that's just a whole other level of tough.

459
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.280
Think about like somebody you went to high school with who did do,

460
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.070
didn't give a fuck and he would,
he would throw down with anybody.

461
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.910
Did he have 20 fights in the entire time?
You know him

462
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.500
and if he did,
how many years was that?
Did He have 20 fights?

463
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.840
Nobody has 20 fights in six months.
Go fuck yourself for everybody.
You email,

464
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.590
dude,
I know this guy.
I know this guy.
Yeah,
I don't believe it.

465
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:32.450
I want to see the video.
I don't know.
That's just one of those.

466
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.810
There's a few things,
right?
I think all guys,

467
00:28:35.811 --> 00:28:37.580
you try to pretend you're tougher than you are,

468
00:28:37.581 --> 00:28:39.000
but then there's a few things that you see.

469
00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:42.290
You just see something like that and you just realize like,
I am a fucking,

470
00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:44.060
I should be walking around wearing a dress.

471
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:49.370
And then that guy,
John Scott actually said he was,

472
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.200
he was legitimately concerned going,
you know,
yeah,
we fought,
but I,
I,
I felt bad.

473
00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:56.030
He didn't come back.
You don't want to hurt anybody.

474
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.030
Like those are the true tough guys that just go out and,
and do the job.

475
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.970
They don't try to be dirty or any of that type of Shit,
you know?
Um,

476
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.100
but I watched a couple of things this week that got my ego in check and one of

477
00:29:09.261 --> 00:29:13.520
them was watching Sean Thornton fight.

478
00:29:13.521 --> 00:29:15.230
John Scott Watch when he does it too.

479
00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:19.520
It's like he realizes the guys half a foot taller and 50 pounds more when they

480
00:29:19.521 --> 00:29:21.620
dropped the,
they're dropping the gloves in.

481
00:29:21.621 --> 00:29:26.420
Thorton is already reaching to grab him to somehow get inside where it's just

482
00:29:26.421 --> 00:29:27.980
like,
I do not want to be,

483
00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:33.710
if this guy can extend his arm and I'm going to take this punch from the

484
00:29:33.711 --> 00:29:34.670
stratosphere,

485
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.920
I just can't imagine what that's like lining up next to a mountain gone.

486
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.250
This is my job.
I have to fight this guy.

487
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:46.270
And you don't even get like gloves to at least protect your hands,
you know?

488
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.900
Ugh.
Anyways,

489
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.580
so I saw that and like my ego wasn't already enough in check.

490
00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.400
Um,
I then watched this thing about the most dangerous criminals,

491
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.770
any penal system,
whatever the fuck they call it.
And they interviewed

492
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.370
for maniacs.

493
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

494
00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.750
<v 0>Three of all white dudes.
And I swear to God,
when white dude's become maniacs,</v>

495
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.360
you know,
I don't want to talk shit,
but I really think that we,

496
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.250
we really do it better than anybody else.

497
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:27.410
When a fucking white dude goes rogue,
a lot of people are going to get hurt.

498
00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.910
I'm telling you
that Hannibal,

499
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.830
like when a real life,

500
00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:37.610
Hannibal Lecter comes along and I know a bunch of def jam comics,

501
00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:42.470
I've done a bit about this,
but it really is true.
You know,
Melina,

502
00:30:42.471 --> 00:30:44.490
the classic Def Jam bit,
if somebody,
whatever,

503
00:30:44.491 --> 00:30:47.990
shoot somebody stabbed somebody or whatever,
that could be a black guy,

504
00:30:47.991 --> 00:30:50.750
Latino guy.
But if somebody,
after they shoot him,

505
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.490
stab him and then they fucking make a fucking ear sandwich or something,

506
00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:56.720
you know,

507
00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.440
chop off the guy's hand and stick the guy's ear in between it and just munch on

508
00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:03.680
it.
When the cops show up and they're sitting there with their feet on the coffee

509
00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:06.800
table,
like,
hey officer,
that's going to be a white guy.

510
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.360
So there's showing,

511
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.190
<v 1>yeah,</v>

512
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.950
<v 0>whatever they pick.
Like I wish I remember what channel was on.</v>

513
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:16.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

514
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.450
<v 0>They showed for the biggest fucking maniacs.
Oh,
you know what?</v>

515
00:31:21.451 --> 00:31:22.470
I watched it online.

516
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

517
00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:28.910
<v 0>Did I watch it online?
Yeah,
I did.
I did watch it online.
I'll,
I'll,</v>

518
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.090
I'll get the clip for you.
So I watched this thing and

519
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:33.700
<v 1>okay.</v>

520
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.580
<v 0>They had this fucking one white dude.</v>

521
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.700
He was hilarious because he was really like,

522
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.650
he was at scariest kind of evil where he was.
Uh,
there's two kinds of scary evil.

523
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.230
There's that one where you're,

524
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:50.350
you're off like border line.
Like,

525
00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:53.650
I don't even know if you've got a complete brain and what,

526
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:57.370
you almost have like a reptilian brain and you're acting literally like a

527
00:31:57.371 --> 00:32:01.270
fucking Komodo Dragon.
Like you just don't give a shit,
you know?

528
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.000
Yeah.
But you have see like a reptile eat something.

529
00:32:04.001 --> 00:32:07.570
Like it could give a fuck if a reptile ever fucks with the mammal.

530
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:11.230
A mammal is going through the emotions.
And I got ah,

531
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:13.950
screaming in pain and the reptile is just,

532
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.370
just sitting there with this blank look on his face as it slowly swallowing,

533
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.230
swallowing the fucking mammal hall.
Um,

534
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.340
even when snakes fucking eat other snakes,
the snakes,
this getting eaten,

535
00:32:27.341 --> 00:32:31.000
it's just kind of go on this fucking,
it doesn't really give a fuck.

536
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.490
It never lose.
I mean,
it still has sort of a fierce look on its fate.

537
00:32:35.491 --> 00:32:38.020
If did I just say fierce?
Like it's a fucking Broadway dancer,

538
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.290
like a ferocious look on his face,
but they never like,

539
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:47.270
reptiles never have that,
you know?
Oh my God.
Like they,

540
00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:51.320
they don't,
they don't have that.
They just don't have that emotion.

541
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.520
They just either sitting there going,
God damn,
it's cold out.

542
00:32:55.521 --> 00:32:59.180
I got to get in the sun.
Or they're like,
I'm going to fucking kill you.

543
00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:01.150
I just bit you and I'm going to just wait till the,

544
00:33:01.151 --> 00:33:06.050
the I'm gonna slowly choke you out.
They just don't give a fuck.
We get it,
Bill.

545
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:10.790
We've seen the animal channel.
All right.
All right.
Whatever.
So
yeah,

546
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:14.270
these psychos,
they're either like that or they're even worse.

547
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.990
Did just like super intelligent and they're completely aware of what they're

548
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:22.670
doing and they just don't give a shit.
And that was the guy that I saw.

549
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.120
I saw this,
this white dude,
right?
Shaved head,

550
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.820
tattoos right up to his fucking Adam's apple and he's got a couple of fucking,

551
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:32.654
you know,

552
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:33.530
<v 1>okay.</v>

553
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.090
<v 0>Little Wayne Shits on his face,
right?
Just a couple of those,
you know,
and uh,</v>

554
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:42.130
he's sitting and he has this look of like,
um,

555
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.150
you would've thought rolling stone was interviewing him about an album that he

556
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:49.400
was really proud of and he knew that this was the one that was,

557
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.530
he was going to make his mark,
you know,

558
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:55.500
when he was just sitting in this fucking cage

559
00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.530
and this woman is interviewing him and she's talking,
you know,

560
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.910
he got arrested for murder,

561
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:07.500
he's on trial for murder and he did the shit.

562
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.150
He knows he's going to get convicted.

563
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:13.950
So he goes into jail and he's not scared.
He fucking embraces it.

564
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.310
He decides that he's just going to become this warrior that he's been put on

565
00:34:20.311 --> 00:34:23.820
this planet to become a fucking warrior.

566
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.720
So we start to reading all those books,
the art of war and all his shit,

567
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.460
and he immediately,
while he's waiting to go on trial,
joins a gang.

568
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.120
Okay.
And one of the things he had to do
to,

569
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.390
to get into the gang was he had to kill somebody.

570
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.130
So for some reason to see his cell mate,
they wanted this guy dead.

571
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

572
00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.550
<v 0>So I forget,
I can't remember how the fuck this guy's story was.</v>

573
00:34:50.551 --> 00:34:55.330
So fucking mind blowing.
He fucking

574
00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:01.680
just brutalize this guy beyond like recognition,
like they couldn't eat,

575
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:04.640
the guy was missing one of his eyeballs,
they couldn't even find it.

576
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.540
And then in the end,
after he kills the fucking guy,

577
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.590
he shuts up his cooktop on top of them,

578
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.330
use them as like a table in like made himself like a fucking egg mcmuffin or

579
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.310
something fucking crazy like that.

580
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.600
So he's telling the story and he's Kinda got this half smile on his face and he

581
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:30.950
goes in,
here's the ironic thing.
He goes,
no.
He goes,
he goes,

582
00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:34.300
I go to my trial and he goes,
and I get it,
quit it.

583
00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.710
He gets,
and he goes,
and that's when he smiled and he goes,

584
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.720
he goes,
yeah.
The irony of it was just that I,
it was just ridiculous.
Like

585
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.570
he was laughing at it.
Like,
I can't even,
I

586
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:56.750
like he was sitting there going on,
you know,
I fucking,
you know,

587
00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.750
put a raincoat on a bubble out,
all this type of shit.

588
00:35:58.751 --> 00:36:02.500
I come outside in the sunshine.
I mean the irony of it was it was ridiculous.

589
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.400
He's fucking cook cooking on top of a guy that he just murdered.

590
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.680
Just sitting there like yeah,
whatever.
And then he gets fucking acquitted.

591
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.933
So then she,

592
00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:17.500
so that's when he like truly just embraces like he got 79 years for what the

593
00:36:17.501 --> 00:36:18.640
fuck he did do his cellmate.

594
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.550
Cause I think at that point they were just going like,
all right,

595
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.600
not only did you do that,

596
00:36:22.601 --> 00:36:24.970
you probably did this other shift that we just acquitted.
You have.

597
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:30.670
So now he's in there and he's in this gang and he's talking about

598
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.600
prison life and just having like a shank and all that type of thing.

599
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:41.120
And he's just was literally,
he was like fascinated the same way.

600
00:36:41.121 --> 00:36:44.930
I'm fascinated when I watch a football game,
how the momentum can shift.

601
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.510
He was talking about prison life like that.
Like,

602
00:36:47.511 --> 00:36:52.040
how quickly it can shift and why you have to have a shank.

603
00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:56.270
Because you know,
everything can be cool,
everything's great.

604
00:36:56.271 --> 00:36:59.450
And all of a sudden somebody getting stuck like 9 million fucking times and he

605
00:36:59.451 --> 00:37:04.250
said something to the effect of a,
you know,
I've seen it,
I've done it.

606
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.560
He's just sitting there just proud.

607
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:12.800
Then they went to two other fucking crazy white dudes.

608
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:17.460
One guy was just sitting there going,
just talking about a,
you know,

609
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:22.140
I just really enjoy hurting people.

610
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.970
You got to see this fucking video.
And I didn't even get to the black dude.

611
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:30.480
The black dude was in the end.
And uh,
I didn't read it,

612
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:33.900
but they said that I saw some of the comments under the youtube videos said that

613
00:37:33.901 --> 00:37:36.540
last black guy let the black dude's shouldn't have been in there cause he seemed

614
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:39.420
like he was bipolar.
So I didn't get to the crazy guy.

615
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:42.330
There's always the one fucking crazy dude.
But,
uh,

616
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.190
hopefully I'll be able to get you guys this video.

617
00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:46.470
But it's one of those things where,
um,

618
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:48.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

619
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.270
<v 0>You know,
for basically for guys,</v>

620
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.960
one of your number one fears in life is what if I get arrested for some shit I

621
00:37:56.871 --> 00:37:59.180
didn't do and I go to jail?

622
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.890
How do I prevent myself from getting raped?
You know?

623
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.870
And if you don't watch one of these behind the scene prison things,

624
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.290
you can lie to yourself.
I do this,
I do that.

625
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:13.110
You can have your little fucking Kung Fu fantasy and you fucking head.

626
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.020
I'm speaking for everybody.
That was,
this is me.
Anyways,
that's what I do.

627
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:21.640
But the second I ever watch any of those prison fucking things,

628
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.400
I just,
you know,
I would not less,

629
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.200
I would not last three seconds in prison.
Not like you didn't already know that.

630
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.700
I guess this is more for me.

631
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:37.540
I once again was slapped down to the reality of who the fuck I really go.

632
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:42.160
But I'll definitely get those videos for you.
Um,
Jesus Christ.

633
00:38:42.161 --> 00:38:43.570
Am I a chatty Cathy this week?

634
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:46.780
38 fucking minutes and I haven't got to your questions.
All right,

635

uh,

687
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.970
let's get to your questions for the week here.

688
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.230
Or anybody see that?
Montreal Canadiens auto as senator game.

689
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.540
That was some old school refereeing.

690
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:05.270
They used to happen all the time back in the day.
Not so much anymore.

691
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.160
That was classic.
Automatize the game up to two.

692
00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:14.300
All of a sudden the refs wave it off.
No gold goalie interference.

693
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.610
You know,
and I know what people are saying.
Well,

694
00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:19.370
what about the goalie interference in the Bruins?
Toronto game?

695
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.340
I'll tell you this,
at least to go,
Ross got hit.

696
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.480
He was outside of the crease.
Bad call.

697
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.450
Bad call should not have been a disallowed goal.

698
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.530
Hundred percent agree with maple leaf fans,
but come on maple leaf fans.

699
00:42:33.531 --> 00:42:34.820
I know you hate the Canadians too.

700
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:39.910
You got to admit at least w Ross got fucking hit fucking Canadians goalie.

701
00:42:40.041 --> 00:42:44.810
Nobody even touched him.
Classic put them on the power play.

702
00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.990
Third period of any Montreal game.
The entire time I was growing up.
Two minutes.

703
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.990
Goalie interference.

704
00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:58.991
Too many men on the boarding four minute power play for the French cunts.

705
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.400
Um,
anyways,

706
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.240
and of course the hang on to when I actually liked what Montreal is doing
though.

707
00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:07.760
I like that they have a bunch of young players and that young kid,

708
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:10.350
one of the young kids that they kept up after the five game trail,

709
00:43:10.351 --> 00:43:14.010
he had a couple of assists the other night,
you know,
when they beat the

710
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.150
hell did they play when they,
they beat him,

711
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.340
the Sabres who embarrassed the Bruins.
So Hey,
if you're not,

712
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:25.370
if you're not into a hockey and you want to get into an Bruins Canadians

713
00:43:25.371 --> 00:43:29.030
Wednesday night,
all right.
It's always,
it's always a great one.

714
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:33.530
You never know who's going to win.
The bad blood goes all the way back to pre,

715
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:37.520
uh,
uh,
the depression.
Okay.
All right,
here we go.

716
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.240
Let's get to the questions for this week.
Herpes and the girl of my dreams.

717
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.880
Um,
I am 27 and about four months ago I met the girl of my dreams.

718
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:51.080
Congratulations.
She is hot,
smart,
funny,

719
00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.200
and has a great career.
We went on four dates.

720
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:58.070
It seemed like she was really into me and we got along great.

721
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:03.410
Unfortunately,
after our fourth date,
I stupidly slept with a skank.

722
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.200
I met at the bar and caught herpes.

723
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.420
Oh my God,
Dude.
Uh,

724
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.310
Jesus,
I've always been careful to use condoms,

725
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:18.950
but that night I was too drunk to keep one on.

726
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.630
I became very sick and immediately called the girl of my dreams and told her

727
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:26.330
that I couldn't see her anymore without my explanation.

728
00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:31.160
Ny and both physically and mentally better.
But I believe she has a boyfriend.

729
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:36.390
My question is whether I should re pursue a relationship with this girl or just

730
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:39.990
move on and hope I find another one like her.
Also,
if I do,

731
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:42.810
should I explain how and when I got herpes,

732
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.000
if she becomes the mother of my children,

733
00:44:45.001 --> 00:44:49.050
I think I would feel guilty if I didn't.
Um,

734
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.070
yeah,
dude,
if you want to get it back,
he uh,
you know,

735
00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:59.650
uh,
we'll do,
did you already sleep with her?
See,

736
00:44:59.651 --> 00:45:02.620
this is what happens when you live.
You just,
if you try and be like,
well,

737
00:45:02.621 --> 00:45:04.210
if you're not going to own up to that shit,

738
00:45:04.211 --> 00:45:08.770
I know all the women right now are screaming,
all the women are screaming,

739
00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.340
which is fair because if a woman wrote this,
I would be like,
yeah,

740
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.980
that's your fault to sleeping with that dirty dick.
Um,
you got,
yeah,
dude,

741
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:19.450
you got to totally come clean.
You've got to tell her exactly what happens,

742
00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.120
you know,
and uh,

743
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:28.390
oh Jesus,
dude.
You know,

744
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:33.310
I can't judge it either because you know,
every guy has gone out and done that.

745
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.860
That whole scenario fucked around,
not used a condom except you,

746
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:43.660
you had the bad luck dude.
Oh my God.
As fucking brutal.

747
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.040
Uh,
Jesus.
Well there you go.
People,
they have theirs.

748
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.900
If that doesn't convince you to wear a condom and not sleep with a skank cause I

749
00:45:52.901 --> 00:45:57.380
even heard it,
you know,
even if you wear a condom,
you know,
I,
I don't know.

750
00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:02.180
They say you can still get,
it's fucking terrifying.
Fucking terrifying.

751
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.200
How I never stepped on that landmine is beyond me.
So,
dude,

752
00:46:06.201 --> 00:46:08.210
what if you really want to get this girl back?
You know,

753
00:46:08.211 --> 00:46:11.090
every great relationship starts with 100% honesty.

754
00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.110
And I'm not going to lie to you.
I think,
you know,
dude,
you're,
you're,

755
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:19.070
that's a hell of a whole to try and crawl out of,
no pun intended.

756
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.720
Um,
but,
uh,
but from here on out,
man,

757
00:46:25.721 --> 00:46:28.030
you gotta you can't do what that skank did to you.

758
00:46:28.031 --> 00:46:32.810
You gotta be honest with people.
Uh,
yeah,
I do.
That's,

759
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.690
that's brutal.
That's brutal.
But you know what?

760
00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:39.430
It's not the end of the fucking world.
Jesus Christ.

761
00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:41.890
But yeah,
you got,
you gotta come with where with with total honesty,

762
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.630
total honesty and a,
yeah.

763
00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.050
Turn it in and turn it into a positive dude.
You know,

764
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:54.280
you're being a fucking dirty dog.
Now I'm telling you,

765
00:46:54.281 --> 00:46:57.290
I believe though,
if you come with total honesty and you,
you,

766
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.370
you stay on a righteous path,
that you will meet that person.

767
00:47:00.371 --> 00:47:04.450
If it's not this one at,
uh,
you know,
who knows?

768
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.181
I don't know.
I'm not trying,

769
00:47:07.181 --> 00:47:11.890
I'm trying not to use a cliche that everything happens for a reason.
Um,

770
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.140
I don't believe that.
And I think,
you know,

771
00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:19.150
you fucked up and now you're paying the price and uh,

772
00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.180
you got to try to turn the ship around.
So,
uh,
good luck with that.

773
00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.750
But like I said,
I would go with 100% honesty.
You got to,

774
00:47:25.751 --> 00:47:29.860
you can't do that to her.
I can't do that to her.
Um,
all right,

775
00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:33.970
advice from Japan.
Uh,
Bill,
I'm 28 single and I live in Japan.

776
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:37.960
I'm originally from America,
America and I moved here after college.

777
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.670
I'm a translator and speak decent Japanese.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

778
00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:46.660
how the fuck did you learn that?
You know,
I listen to French,

779
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.550
Spanish,
like that type of shit,
Italian that that seems like,
you know,

780
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:55.250
you'd get a handle on it,
but that's a pack.
I'm foul.

781
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.590
How to fucking jump on that shit is beyond me.
How they,

782
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:02.560
how they can go from there.
It's just be able to speak ours.
I swear to God.

783
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:04.750
It's incredible.
Um,
anyways,

784
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:09.780
when people ask why I say that I love Japanese people and I love living here,

785
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.740
um,
what
to make it better.

786
00:48:15.741 --> 00:48:17.690
I'm a translator and I speak decent Japanese,

787
00:48:17.691 --> 00:48:21.650
but the culture barrier is still pretty huge for me.
When people ask why.
Okay,

788
00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:25.850
there we go.
I say that I love Japanese people and I love living here,

789
00:48:25.851 --> 00:48:29.300
but I wouldn't ever want to become Japanese.
Generally speaking,

790
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.450
they're overworked and unhappy for better or worse.

791
00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:35.780
My attitude keeps me a little isolated.
Yeah,

792
00:48:35.781 --> 00:48:40.160
I've seen that stuff over there like as far as what I've seen.
Um,

793
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.040
you know,
the propaganda from what I've seen,

794
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:47.060
I saw on 60 minutes that if you fuck up at your job,

795
00:48:47.061 --> 00:48:49.880
they send you some camp and then you have to sing the company song.

796
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.060
And these guys were singing the song trying to get back into the company.

797
00:48:53.061 --> 00:48:56.300
They like crying and everything and there's like for Japanese dude's just

798
00:48:56.301 --> 00:48:58.100
looking at him,
just ice cold.

799
00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.580
Simon cobbles to the fucking nine thousands power,

800
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:06.600
like your family disowns you,
it's crazy.

801
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.890
It's hardcore over there,
man.
Straightening the dam rivers.
Uh,

802
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:14.340
there is one very Japanese woman.
What does that mean?

803
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:18.060
I've met who I recently connected with.
In spite of all that.

804
00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:22.200
She's an amateur artists and actress and we've worked together to make subtitles

805
00:49:22.201 --> 00:49:25.200
for local independent movies.
That's how we met actually.

806
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:29.430
She's interesting as hell and downright sexy to problems.

807
00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:32.970
She's married and has his son.
Dude,
what the fuck?

808
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.810
Oh,
are you trying to get a fucking Samurai's sword to your juggler?

809
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.110
You're going to fuck a married broad with a kid in a different country,

810
00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.410
do it.
I don't.
I don't know anything about the Japanese culture.

811
00:49:49.411 --> 00:49:53.220
But if you can lose face for not having enough paperclips at your God damn desk

812
00:49:53.221 --> 00:49:56.550
and get sent to a borderline death camp and you've got to sing a fucking song to

813
00:49:56.551 --> 00:50:00.360
get back into the company,
how much face do you lose if round?

814
00:50:00.361 --> 00:50:03.420
I fucks your fucking woman though.
You're,
you're gonna,

815
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:06.030
you're gonna get thrown into one of their straightened rivers.

816
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.020
I,
come on,
man.

817
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:17.460
Come on man.
Don't do this.

818
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:23.180
He said from early on it was obvious that there was a mutual attraction going
on,

819
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:28.250
especially whenever we were at a movie party with a of drinks in us.

820
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:33.320
Like any guy would.
I wanted to sleep with her,
but I didn't dwell on it.

821
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:37.700
Good for you.
It seemed,
it never seemed like it was in the cards,

822
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:41.990
but we were working together.
We kept each other at,
Oh,
when we working together,

823
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:46.580
we kept each other at arm's length.
Months went by without anything changing.

824
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.210
Oh my God,
Dude.
This is like watching this.
This is like a suspense thriller.

825
00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:55.470
Dude.
You can't do this.
There's a kid involved.

826
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.680
That kid loves his mom and his dad.

827
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.270
You're going to go in there and your Dick like a Samurai sword is going to slice

828
00:51:03.271 --> 00:51:07.540
that kid's life and half he can't do it.
I want to read the rest of this.

829
00:51:07.541 --> 00:51:12.360
Of one eye closed then came the local film festival.
Oh geesh.

830
00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.410
When it finished,
we were downtown and pleasantly drunk.

831
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.600
<v 1>Okay,</v>

832
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.620
<v 0>and the last trains that run every night,
we're long gone.</v>

833
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.870
Well,
isn't that convenient?

834
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.560
When she mentioned taking an expensive cab ride home,

835
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:33.100
I suggested that she crashed at my nearby apartment until the morning train

836
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:34.760
started.
No,
you didn't.

837
00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.820
You didn't suggest that you dick did your decks like relax,

838
00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.760
stand down.
I've got this.
Anyways,

839
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.820
she had been there a dozen times already because that's where we always worked.

840
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.360
Oh my God dude.
This is like some red shoe diary going on here.

841
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.610
I'll cut to the chase
in my apartment that night.

842
00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:02.240
She turned to me and asked point blank if I wanted to fuck.

843
00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

844
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.280
<v 0>Wow.
Dude.
At that point I think all bets are off.</v>

845
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:07.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

846
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.990
<v 0>Okay.
Cause I thought you were kind of seduced in this girl.
Now she just like,</v>

847
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.340
<v 1>okay.</v>

848
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.690
<v 0>Oh Jesus.
Well maybe you should have,</v>

849
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.680
wow,
I didn't see that comment.

850
00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

851
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.240
<v 0>Anyways,
he goes and I told her no.</v>

852
00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:27.370
<v 1>Okay,</v>

853
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:31.210
<v 0>okay.
He goes,
I wasn't exactly surprised that she asked.</v>

854
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:35.680
Part of me was hoping she would when she did though all I could do was go

855
00:52:35.681 --> 00:52:37.900
through what I felt right at that moment.

856
00:52:37.901 --> 00:52:41.770
I admit I really didn't know what to do and was playing it safe.

857
00:52:41.771 --> 00:52:45.400
We went to sleep and she left in the morning.
Here's the thing,

858
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.840
she and her husband who I've never met,
thank God,
don't get along.

859
00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:51.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

860
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.260
<v 0>Oh,
she and her husband don't get along and have no sex whatsoever.
Oh,</v>

861
00:52:55.261 --> 00:52:56.970
so she's in a loveless marriage.

862
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:58.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

863
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.900
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
This is what she told me anyway.</v>

864
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.010
She has long wanted a divorce but won't do it because of her son.

865
00:53:05.011 --> 00:53:09.540
So while saying no,
might have seemed like the noble non home record thing to do.

866
00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.230
Pardon me?
Kept,
keeps asking.
What difference does it make?

867
00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.050
Uh,
you know what?

868
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:21.270
UBC scarf race when the cop goes,
it's your tree frank.
Yes.

869
00:53:21.271 --> 00:53:25.290
Sitting in it.
All right.
That's her fucking situation.

870
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.550
She married a guy that she didn't love and she had a kid.

871
00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:31.053
<v 2>All right.</v>

872
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.290
<v 0>You know,
that's your stepping into the world of her bad decision.</v>

873
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.790
Now think back when you were a kid and you thought about meeting the woman,

874
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:43.560
your dreams.
Is that the way it went down?

875
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.360
I'm not trying to shit on this thing here,
but like,
you know,

876
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.730
I think she needs to be free and clear.

877
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:54.630
If you were actually thinking of getting into a fucking relationship with this

878
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:55.464
person.

879
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.863
<v 2>MMM.</v>

880
00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:02.030
<v 0>Just thinking about banging her.
I don't know,
Dude.
I don't know this fucking kid.</v>

881
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.360
Look if there was no kid involved,
have at it.
But there's just something,

882
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.840
there's some kids sitting at home in some racing car bed,

883
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:13.220
you know love and his mom and his dad.
I Dunno,
I dunno.
That's,

884
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:17.430
do you really want that on your resume anyway,
cause he goes,

885
00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.390
then there's the fact that our friendships suffered anyways because ever since

886
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:24.150
that night she scaled back all the contact with me.

887
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.590
They say that affairs never end well,
but this isn't any,
well either.

888
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:33.040
I don't know.
I just feel like maybe I should have fucked her now.

889
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.420
If you've trusted guy friends say they would have,
of course they would've.

890
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.060
I would've.
I would've.

891
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:43.590
I know I would have if I was drunk and she said that I don't put the kid.

892
00:54:43.591 --> 00:54:47.580
I don't know if I could have blocked out the kid.
I am a piece of shit,

893
00:54:47.581 --> 00:54:51.450
but I don't,
I don't think I'm that big a piece of shit.
I'm just being honest.

894
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:56.490
All right.
I know there's a lot of ladies that are listening to this thing,

895
00:54:56.610 --> 00:55:01.060
but you know how we are.
Okay.
You lead us around by our fucking Dick.

896
00:55:01.061 --> 00:55:03.120
Some fucking hottie you're working with,

897
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:07.140
he's probably all you rub one out 50 times to her finally just says,
Hey,
you,

898
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:10.260
you won't fuck a wood.
I mean,
you're going to do it,

899
00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:13.180
you know,
game on.

900
00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:15.423
<v 2>MMM.</v>

901
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.920
<v 0>You know,
the,
you know,
for any woman,
he gets mad at me.</v>

902
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:23.800
That's some of the most honest shit about men.
You're ever going to fucking here.

903
00:55:23.801 --> 00:55:27.810
So go fuck yourself in your email that you send me.
Okay.
God bless you.
Uh,

904
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.510
my few trusted guy friends say they would have a whatever.

905
00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.780
She may sound like,
I think a lot of this woman,

906
00:55:34.781 --> 00:55:38.290
and I've never had someone like her just throw herself at me before.

907
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:41.200
I'm starting to feel like I missed the boat.
Then again,

908
00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:44.440
she's fucking married and has a kid.
What would he view had done?

909
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:46.840
I told you what I would have done if she was single.

910
00:55:46.841 --> 00:55:49.780
I remember she was married and didn't have a kid and she was in this loveless

911
00:55:49.781 --> 00:55:54.430
fucking thing.
And every day next to her working together.
She's in my apartment,

912
00:55:54.431 --> 00:55:55.810
comes over smelling good,

913
00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.010
and I have a couple of fucking drinks in me and she says he won't fuck,

914
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:02.050
would for some reason has a southern accent.
I'm all over it.

915
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:07.150
I would have felt like shit immediately.
I would have felt guilty,

916
00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:11.020
but I'm fucking week.
All right,
I'm a guy,

917
00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:15.430
I'm a fucking moron and it would have been the wrong thing to do.

918
00:56:15.431 --> 00:56:19.540
So you did the fucking right thing.
You did the fucking right to do it.

919
00:56:19.541 --> 00:56:24.080
I'll tell you right now,
you know what?
Go Rub one out tour.
What do you feel like

920
00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.080
<v 2>afterwards?
Do you still feel you not,
you're kind of relieved like,</v>

921
00:56:27.081 --> 00:56:30.170
thank God I didn't do it.
You know,

922
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.093
I dunno.

923
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.920
<v 0>I just feel bad for her.
You know she married the wrong guy.</v>

924
00:56:39.921 --> 00:56:42.350
She's got a kid with them and then she's fucking says,
Hey,

925
00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:45.990
do you want to bang me a what?
And you're like,
no.
And she's guest.

926
00:56:45.991 --> 00:56:50.030
If you're walking back on,
what the fuck is wrong with my thing?
You know,

927
00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.650
why is it my light Saber working here?
I got this power and it's not fucking,

928
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:57.410
it's not,
it's not happening for me.
Um,

929
00:56:59.110 --> 00:56:59.860
<v 2>okay.</v>

930
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.500
<v 0>I Dunno.
I can tell you how to get that train back on the tracks,</v>

931
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:05.530
but I don't want to do that to you.
So,
uh,
don't,
don't do it,
dude.

932
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.880
There's a kid involved.
Okay.
Even I have standards.

933
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.910
You got to have some sort of standards.
All right?

934
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:17.020
We just shout your Dick back into your pants.
Like

935
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.790
I said,
stay the fuck down.
You know,

936
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:27.070
you got to have some sort of something.
All right,

937
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:28.323
look,

938
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:30.523
<v 2>okay.</v>

939
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.610
<v 0>She's eventually going to leave that guy.
She is,
but I'm telling you,
dude,
that's,</v>

940
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:37.400
that's not your fucking,
get the fuck out of there.
All right.
Get out of there.

941
00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:42.860
What do we got here?
57 minutes in.
Here we go.
Sticking it to the X.

942
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.940
Should I all right,
right out of the gate I could tell you no,

943
00:57:46.941 --> 00:57:51.610
but let me hear the story.
I'm 28 and I found out about you and move up,
up,

944
00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:54.080
up above or I,
I'm going to get right to it.

945
00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:59.420
My ex wife and I had been together for about five years before we decided to get

946
00:57:59.421 --> 00:58:01.100
married right after university.

947
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.850
Her family was religious so we couldn't live together first,

948
00:58:04.851 --> 00:58:06.920
so that seemed like the next step

949
00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.810
as a new Grad was working hard,

950
00:58:11.811 --> 00:58:16.370
trying to get work in my field and basically starting at the bottom,

951
00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:17.720
but slowly getting my footing.

952
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:22.130
She was working at the same bank she had since high school and through

953
00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.830
university and it was filing,
moving up the ranks.

954
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:28.790
Fast forward a year and a half into our marriage and she's getting promoted to

955
00:58:28.791 --> 00:58:31.880
manager to manage your bank downtown.

956
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.050
She gets a good raise and things are looking good for me or so I thought.

957
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:39.650
Then a week after she starts this job,
she lays it on me.

958
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

959
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.450
<v 0>She wants to know what it's like to be single again.</v>

960
00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.860
She never really wanted to get married and apparently she feels that the spark

961
00:58:48.861 --> 00:58:51.680
isn't there anymore.
There is no other guy,

962
00:58:51.681 --> 00:58:56.450
but she just doesn't like who I am anymore and there was nothing in the six

963
00:58:56.451 --> 00:59:01.370
years of us being together worth saving.
Oh Jesus.
Well,
listen,

964
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:07.250
Kudos to her for being fucking honest and not wasting another five years of your

965
00:59:07.251 --> 00:59:08.084
life.

966
00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.190
<v 2>Okay,</v>

967
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:13.600
<v 0>so he goes after.
So after some self reflection and a bit of counseling,</v>

968
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.800
a bit of boozing with friends and an amazingly insightful mushroom trip,

969
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:22.760
I realized this is a blessing in disguise.
She doesn't like who I am anymore.

970
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:28.150
Like there was something wrong with me other than taking a shit and being

971
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:31.910
committed to her for almost six years.
Okay,
this is understandable anger.

972
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.470
I get it.
Get it out of you.
He says,
fuck her.
We had no kids,

973
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.250
not many assets at this point.
A dog that I get.

974
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:46.240
It was a get out of jail card,
a guilt freeway,
a guilt free way,

975
00:59:46.241 --> 00:59:50.710
clean.
What a guilt free way,

976
00:59:50.711 --> 00:59:54.250
clean way to get out from under the hood of an oppressive.

977
00:59:54.251 --> 00:59:59.251
Can't have a wife who had turned me into a shadow of my former self content with

978
00:59:59.501 --> 01:00:00.334
being fucked.

979
01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.340
Maybe once a month we both move out and put our place for our place up for sale.

980
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.500
All right.
No it doesn't.

981
01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.210
I don't think that this guy really feels that this woman has a cunt.

982
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:14.680
He's just saying this cause she fucking dumped him and he goes,

983
01:00:14.681 --> 01:00:17.710
I immediately gave myself a no contact policy,

984
01:00:17.711 --> 01:00:22.150
blocked her on Facebook and you could only talk about business with her until we

985
01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:25.540
got through the separation negotiations in June.
They go,
it's a strong move.

986
01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:28.030
I like it.
Then silence.

987
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.480
The other policy I gave myself was to say yes to any opportunity that was

988
01:00:33.581 --> 01:00:37.840
presented.
This helped me make this past summer the best of my life.

989
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.380
Full of trips and sleeping with new girls,
hotter and younger than her.

990
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.880
Older and uglier.
It didn't matter.
I was saying yes.
Well for the love of God,

991
01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:48.130
wear a condom,
sir.
Um,

992
01:00:48.131 --> 01:00:52.600
even after finding out from one of her friends a few months later that she had

993
01:00:52.601 --> 01:00:57.220
been dating slash living with this guy she had worked with since about a month

994
01:00:57.221 --> 01:01:00.010
after she left me.
Yeah.
This girl is like a,

995
01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:03.670
she goes from relationship to relationship.
Anyways,
he said,

996
01:01:03.671 --> 01:01:05.560
I didn't break the no content policy.

997
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:10.300
I didn't want her to think I gave two shits about her anymore.
This guy,

998
01:01:10.301 --> 01:01:11.134
by the way,

999
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:15.350
I had met on many occasions at work functions and even when it came,

1000
01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:16.760
<v 1>okay,</v>

1001
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.470
<v 0>came out for her birthday that year.</v>

1002
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.370
I fucking told her that this dude is into you.
I don't like him,

1003
01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:26.960
but she would say,
oh,
he's just a friend.
He's a fucking snake in the grass.

1004
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.160
Oh,
this guy,
he's like so angry.

1005
01:01:30.161 --> 01:01:33.580
He's not even writing in complete sentences and he's his fucking snake

1006
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:37.460
in the grass,
but she's a whore.
I'm not an idiot.

1007
01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:40.040
So I can guess that this wasn't just a lucky coincidence.

1008
01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:44.150
They both happened to be singled together and likely why things move so fast

1009
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.990
regardless.
I kept to my policy now almost a year later,

1010
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:52.880
I'm in the best shape of my life after losing 40 pounds.
Good for you,
man.

1011
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:55.610
Good for you.
This is great.

1012
01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.410
Just starting a new job where I make as much as her and in my field have a

1013
01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:02.120
hotter girlfriend and have one.

1014
01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:06.530
All the mutual friends we had there were worth keeping.

1015
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.190
So why do you need revenge?
He goes,
all is good,

1016
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.760
but I've been feeling like a bit of a bitch for not taking her to task on all of

1017
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:16.850
this shit,

1018
01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:21.570
especially now that we've been separated for almost a year and soon can be

1019
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.160
legally divorced in Canada.

1020
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:26.580
I think it's time to finally confront her and break her,

1021
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.440
so I would like to take this bitch down and my advice on how to go about it

1022
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:35.670
would be great.
Sorry about the length and thanks for any help,
dude.

1023
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.230
You're already taken her down.

1024
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.410
They say the the greatest revenge is a life well lived.

1025
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:47.560
You're doing it.
You lost 40 pounds.
You have a hotter girlfriend.

1026
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:53.280
Just keep saying yes.
I go easy with the sleeping around.
Dude,

1027
01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:58.200
you don't want to catch anything man,
but you know,
just go live your life.

1028
01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:02.130
Leave her in the dust.
Okay?

1029
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.150
She's going to check out your Facebook page.
She'll see your pictures.

1030
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.490
You really want to get back at this girl.

1031
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:12.930
Don't ever talk to her again and just live this awesome life.

1032
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.640
Marry a beautiful woman.

1033
01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:18.600
Keep yourself in great shape and just know every once in a while she's going to

1034
01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:21.240
check in and I guaran fucking tee you.
Unless this guy,

1035
01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:26.100
they just had this ridiculous spark at work.
Then God bless them.
She,

1036
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:30.980
she found who she should have been with as will you and it's all good.

1037
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:35.690
Or Jesus serial.
What monogamous.
Whatever the fuck it is.

1038
01:03:35.691 --> 01:03:36.524
I'm so dumb.

1039
01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.520
She goes from relationship to relationship and eventually this dickhead snake in

1040
01:03:40.521 --> 01:03:43.480
the grass bank is gonna um,

1041
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.260
get the same speech or he might give it to her.

1042
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:50.010
He might be one of these creeps that it turned around that he's in a relation,

1043
01:03:50.011 --> 01:03:54.780
that she's in a relationship and he can be fucking banging this chick,
you know,

1044
01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.750
fuck them.
Fuck them with their,
their bank or sex.

1045
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:04.980
They probably have to wear masks.
You know,
they have some sort of ritual.

1046
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:08.420
Um,
anyways,
yeah,
dude,
don't do that.

1047
01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:12.890
Don't do that because you know what you're doing when you walk up to her and you

1048
01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:14.840
fucking go,
let me tell you something.
You fucking cunt.

1049
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:18.690
The blahblahblahblahblah women are too smart for that shit.

1050
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:23.910
She just sitting there going like,
wow,
he's still does care.
Wow.

1051
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:26.010
He lost that weight because of me.

1052
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.140
Not because he's actually a better person than I thought he was.
All right,

1053
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.630
don't do that.
She wins.
If you confront her,
she fucking wins.

1054
01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:38.640
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Yelling at her like she's in the room,

1055
01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:42.300
but she isn't screaming your windshield.
Okay.

1056
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.980
But keeps saying yes in life.

1057
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.060
Keep going after your dreams and just live this fucking awesome life.

1058
01:04:48.061 --> 01:04:50.670
And maybe one day,
who knows?
You go to the same mall,

1059
01:04:50.671 --> 01:04:54.760
you show up with your hot wife and two beautiful kids.
She shows up.
She's fat.

1060
01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:58.690
You know,
they give you like,
just give her a nod,

1061
01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:03.280
a switch.
You could have been with Johnny six pack over here.

1062
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.960
Oh,
and you just keep going.

1063
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.910
You take your kids for an ice cream when you get yourself a Sherbert.
Um,

1064
01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:19.270
all right,
this is one.
Um,
you guys great this week.
Great questions.
Um,

1065
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.370
okay.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Last one.

1066
01:05:21.371 --> 01:05:26.140
Racism in a relationship or old geezers um,
oh,
she,
oh,

1067
01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:30.250
she says questions for you.
And the lovely Nia.
If she's there,

1068
01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.250
oh fuck,
she isn't here.

1069
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:39.230
My boyfriend of a month told me that his mom is racist and his grandpa is
racist,

1070
01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:43.520
to the point where he,
he would disown my boyfriend.

1071
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.830
Uh,
he says he's not racist,

1072
01:05:45.831 --> 01:05:49.220
but he shrugs off family comments and is very nonconfrontational.

1073
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:53.300
I'm not fully black.
Um,
I like to call.
I'm like,
what I,

1074
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:57.230
what I like to call half African.
Uh,
my mom is from Kenya.

1075
01:05:57.231 --> 01:06:00.590
My Dad is French Canadian.
I live in Canada,
so I'm not used to racism.

1076
01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.750
In fact,
I'm so confused when somebody calls me the n word.

1077
01:06:05.751 --> 01:06:09.020
I can't help but think my families from Africa,
they should use

1078
01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:13.680
the term.
Oh yeah,
I've heard of that term,
which I'm not going to do.

1079
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:16.560
I'm not going to say it to my podcast because that's just going to give more

1080
01:06:16.561 --> 01:06:21.180
runs,
you know?
I don't know.
They'll probably figure it out what it is,

1081
01:06:21.181 --> 01:06:24.870
but they're not gonna learn it from me anyways.
Um,
he says,

1082
01:06:24.871 --> 01:06:27.840
I'm so stupid when it comes to people being racist towards me.

1083
01:06:27.841 --> 01:06:29.730
I don't even know how I'm supposed to react.

1084
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.200
Obviously I'm hurt and I'm sure there's some obligation I have to stand on

1085
01:06:34.201 --> 01:06:38.390
behalf of the belittlement of society.
But what do I say it?
What?
Wait,

1086
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.760
when we read that more,
I'm sure there's some obligation.

1087
01:06:41.761 --> 01:06:45.000
I have to take a stand on behalf of the betterment of society.

1088
01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:48.630
But what do I say to him or his family?
I don't know what I should do.

1089
01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:51.000
My boyfriend is worth fighting for,

1090
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:54.960
but family is irreplaceable and I don't want to rip his apart because he,

1091
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.700
his needs to be there for him.
If I can't.
Thanks.
Um,

1092
01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.130
ah,
I don't,
yeah,
he would like to think that he would step up there.

1093
01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:11.240
I don't look,
when it comes to your grandparents,
what are you going to do?

1094
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:13.400
You're going to change 80 years.
They are how they are.

1095
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:18.350
You know about your parents.
That's,
that's a a harder issue.

1096
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.560
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1097
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.630
<v 0>Which obviously could grow into a bigger issue if you get even more serious.</v>

1098
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:26.743
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1099
01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.250
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

1100
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:31.490
I think that you should be somebody with somebody who has your fucking back.

1101
01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:34.070
And I think you need to sit down with him and tell him that he needs to have you

1102
01:07:34.071 --> 01:07:38.560
back.
And that is parents need to accept who the fuck he's dating or raw.

1103
01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:42.650
You're going to move on and get with somebody who's more of a fucking man and

1104
01:07:42.651 --> 01:07:47.600
kin.
You know that if you're with somebody,
they gotta be with you.
Okay?

1105
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.550
He is in an awkward position,

1106
01:07:49.551 --> 01:07:53.990
but he needs to sit down and have a talk with his parents,

1107
01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:57.110
his grandparents that,
that's a fucking wash.
You know what I mean?

1108
01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:03.010
Old People always bitch and that bitch in about everything.
So,
you know,
whatever.

1109
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:05.590
Um,
I mean,

1110
01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:09.610
grandparents came up in a time where if you were Irish and she was Italian,

1111
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:14.460
they would flip out,
do a Protestant and this person was Catholic.
Like they,

1112
01:08:14.461 --> 01:08:19.010
they would separating to that level.
Um,
but yeah,

1113
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.220
I think,
uh,
I think you need to have a talk with them,
you know?

1114
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:24.620
And if that ends it and he goes his separate way,

1115
01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:28.430
then you know what you got off easy because eventually what it come to a head

1116
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:30.740
and you wouldn't have been happy.
All right?

1117
01:08:31.190 --> 01:08:33.620
Regardless of whether it's a race issue or whatever,

1118
01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:38.030
the person you're with has to have you fucking back on the big ship.
Okay.

1119
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:41.690
The little stuff about doing dishes and arguing about that,

1120
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:45.860
that's just crap that you argue about.
But something like that is,
I mean,

1121
01:08:45.861 --> 01:08:48.590
that's the whole thing.
Holding the fucking thing together.
If that,

1122
01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.270
that's the foundation.
If that's not there,

1123
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:54.500
then you're wasting your time and you only get one life and you shouldn't be

1124
01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:58.190
wasting fucking time.
So that's my advice.
All right.

1125
01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.870
And that is the podcast for this week.
Thank you everybody for listening.
And uh,

1126
01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:07.580
now the weird sadness of football is over.

1127
01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.530
The stunned that Monday you wake up,
you know,

1128
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.010
and it's fucking over.
There is not a game.
Next week is brutal.

1129
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:20.150
So my suggestion this week get into NBA hoop or the NHL.

1130
01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:24.320
And if you want to get into the NHL,
I cannot recommend the,
uh,

1131
01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.620
the NHL Center ice package enough.
Pick a team,

1132
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:32.330
you know,
learn all their players and that type of shit.

1133
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:36.740
It's a fucking beautiful game.
And I'm so happy it's back.
And I,
I'm telling you,

1134
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:41.000
Canadians,
Bruins,
even when both those teams suck,

1135
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:44.690
it's always a great game and neither team sucks right now.

1136
01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:47.570
Canadians are playing great.
They're there,
they're rebuilding their team,

1137
01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:51.480
they got all this young talent and uh,
the Bruins are,

1138
01:09:51.481 --> 01:09:55.120
the Bruins were playing great ourselves other than,

1139
01:09:55.121 --> 01:09:59.150
than that fucking game against this same,
um,

1140
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:03.140
whatever.
Pull up a chair,
watch a game,
and right,
go fuck yourselves.

1141
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:04.550
Have a great week.
I'll talk to you later.
