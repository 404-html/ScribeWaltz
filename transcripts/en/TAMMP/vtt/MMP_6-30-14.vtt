00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.930
June 30th,
2014.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.970
Um,
what's going on?
I am a,
I am in Las Vegas,

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.163
Nevada.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.440
I had a wonderful weekend out here at the Mirage casita um,

6
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:26.670
I want to thank everybody who came down to the shows.
It was a wonderful time.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.960
Everybody seemed to enjoy themselves.
Um,

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.710
and I'm out of here right now because,
uh,
the all in tour starring Jason Law,

9
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.260
Joe Part Nick and uh,
Paul New Jersey Versie um,

10
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.900
was at,
uh,

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.260
was over at Harris and I stopped in last night as I said that I would and all

12
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.280
red face jumped up on stage in the end throughout our new 15,
20 minutes.

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.830
All right.
I already got one new bit.
I got one new bit for my,
uh,

14
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.330
my next hour,
uh,
that I'm already loving and that I'm adding to it.

15
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.650
And I'm literally,

16
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.620
you know what's hilarious is cause I don't have any material now technically,
um,

17
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.000
once my,
you know,
all that other shit that I just did is gone.

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.920
So anything that I'm even seeing remotely funny,
I'm just fucking latching onto.

19
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.790
And so I was doing a lot of people watching last night and I was just

20
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.791
desperately just anything I could think of like I fucking saw.

21
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.830
But even even I got to draw a line somewhere cause I like,
I saw this,
uh,

22
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.350
this woman was walking through the bar at this casino we were at.

23
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.950
And uh,
we over it seizes and um,

24
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.530
she's walking through the bar and there's gay do with sandals jeans in this

25
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.480
really fucking,
I thought it was an ugly tank top,
whatever.

26
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.400
He sees her and I guess they're friends and he fucking freaks out.

27
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.560
Oh my God.

28
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.950
Runs over and fucking gives me this huge hug.

29
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.900
I was literally like,
you know what,
I want to gate front,
you know,

30
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.160
somebody gets said fuck it.
Excited when I walk into a room,

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.580
you know.
And that was really like,
oh dude,
I should talk about that.
I just talk.

32
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.470
But then I actually had to stop myself just going,
all right bill,
you know what?

33
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.730
Every stupid little thought you have does not need to go to the stage.

34
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.590
And then I argued with myself yet does get does cause I just burned fucking 90

35
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:35.520
minutes a shit.
I need that.
I need that bit.

36
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.570
I've already fucking,
I know another little half ass idea.
Holy Shit.

37
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:44.490
Somebody just scored a goal.
Sorry in the background I have on France versus uh,

38
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.390
some team in lime green.
Um,

39
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.720
anyways,
uh,
the fuck am I doing?

40
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.830
I really shouldn't have that on.
And you know,

41
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:58.980
I have it on in the background cause I thought the USA was playing Belgium
today.

42
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.490
They thought it was fucking Tuesday

43
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 1>and I can't keep track of fucking anything.
I,
I have no idea.</v>

44
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.770
I just really have to give it to the fact that,
uh,

45
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.620
as much as I respect the sport,
I just,
um,

46
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.660
<v 2>okay.</v>

47
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.990
<v 1>I don't know.
I'm too busy to figure out what's going on.
But uh,
the big deal,</v>

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.550
the big deal this week is tomorrow.
You know,
you guys for a long time,

49
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.650
well I can't say alia,
but a fuel,
you've asked me to go and do it.

50
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.150
Why don't you do a live podcast.
Wouldn't that be cool?

51
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:30.151
I would love to see a live recording of the Monday morning podcast and uh,

52
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.720
my thing has always been like,
look,

53
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.410
you really don't want to see me just lying on a fucking couch.

54
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

55
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.660
<v 1>And God damn jam jams.
Like I even wear those.
I don't,
you know,</v>

56
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.620
just lying here recording a podcast,
it's going to be boring as shit.

57
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.230
And then I'm also going to have to,
um,

58
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.530
I'm going to have to like address the crowd.
It don't think seems weird.

59
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.880
However,
I am not against co hosting a podcast,

60
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:04.300
which is what I'm going to be doing for the first time ever,
ever.

61
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.990
I'm going to be co hosting a live podcast for the all things comedy network at

62
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:14.500

65
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.660
the [inaudible] podcast and it's going to be Tuesday night,

66
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.700
July 1st I think it's an APM is able to do so.

67
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:33.760
Let me click on the link here,

68

We're also going to be having an auction

70
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.700
to raise money for some shit.
I don't know what the hell it is.

71
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.390
And it's just basically personal items that all these Comedians,

72
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:56.680
oh and myself included.
I think I'm donating a hockey stick

73
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.970
and whatever the fuck you want to give us,
we don't give a shit.

74
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.610
You'll be actually be able to call in.
We'll actually going to have callers.

75
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.030

76
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:10.840

77
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.370

82
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:36.500
very fitting that we're having it during the week of this nation's birthday,

83
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.120
July 4th.
I'm so everybody come down.

108
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.360
these casinos are building these clubs.

109
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.200
They have more clubs than they actually have,

110
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.950
like legitimate DJ's.
Um,

111
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.910
and they are,
there was literally,
I was reading this thing,

112
00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:46.180
a lot of literal stuff.
Bill,
we get it.
You're not lying to us.

113
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.370
I was reading this article

114
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.820
called Dj wars inside the Las Vegas battle for the world's top electric

115
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.200
electronic music talent.
Now these fucking guys like,

116
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:02.740
I don't know where any of them are cause I'm old Afro Jack.

117
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.670
Um,
Calvin Harris,

118
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.200
I don't know any of these guys are um,
a couple of their songs.

119
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.880
I've heard them though,
you know,

120
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:16.090
cause my wife watches keeping up with the Kardashians and shit and they're

121
00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:19.570
always playing that in that than the Iranian one,
the Shahs of sunset.

122
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.220
Um,
where they got that dude,

123
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:27.490
the gay guy on that show looks like Freddy Mercury.
Fuck Joseph Stalin.

124
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:33.610
<v 4>Okay.</v>

125
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.610
<v 0>Um,
it looks like gay Saddam Hussein is what he looks like.</v>

126
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.050
He needs a fucking riot.
Um,

127
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.310
cause he's always stirring shit up between the ladies.

128
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.160
He absolutely loves it and he's so fucking passive aggressive.
It'll be like,

129
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:52.750
hey,
so what did parada say?
What'd she called you?

130
00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:56.980
And then they just,
I'm doing yoga.

He fucking,

131
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.260
I dunno,

Whatever.
Whatever.</v>

135
00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:12.430
They're building these,

6,000 young,

138
00:09:19.721 --> 00:09:24.610
beautiful people and the dude or whatever,
I don't know if there's any women Djs,

I guess that they come up with that shit.

141
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.600
They come up with that.
That's theirs.
That's not a sample.

142
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

143
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.500
<v 0>From like fucking John Lennon imitating one of the three stooges.
This,</v>

144
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:51.090
this is their original shit.
So they fucking come up there.
They're famous Accra.

145
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.620
I know a lot of you guys already know this shit.

146
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:57.621
I know they are fucking world famous and they got to lug all their mixes and all

147
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:01.890
this shit around the world at giant mouse heads and all this stuff.

148
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.420
And they just take up.

149
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.200
They just go out there and they play this shit and then make it a zillion

150
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.650
dollars.
So anyways,
out here in Vegas,
that's how they're making all the money.

151
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:13.150
That's how they're packing out.
The casinos are,
uh,

152
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.450
are these djs and um,

153
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.430
they barely promote anything else.

154
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.740
I guess that is the deal.
But,
um,

155
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:31.080
they tried to say that the young kids don't really gamble and they just come out

156
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:36.081
and they get fucked up and they go to these DJ shows and um,

157
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.180
and they're able to make the money.
But this,
I don't want to name names,

158
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.060
I mean the article basically names names and says how much money they're making.

159
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.070
I think that's a little fucking tacky.

160
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.970
But they were saying one guy made like $58 million last year.

161
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

162
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.410
<v 0>Playing that shit to these,</v>

163
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:57.150
to these kids and I got to tell you something.
If you're in a fucking casino

164
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.620
and they don't have that Dj music going on,
I swear to God like,
ah,

165
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:07.621
the casinos I was in last night at 46 years of age,

166
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.850
I was kind of like the youngest person in the casino.
It was fucking unreal.

167
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.890
I was looking around going like,
wait,
where are all the,
where is everybody?

168
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.460
It's just a bunch of old people just sitting there and,

169
00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:26.730
uh,
I guess the raw,
they're all at these other casinos that have these,

170
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.390
these,
uh,
these Dj rumps.
So here's the funny thing,

171
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.800
the typical fucking thing.
So this is the,
so this is the big war now.

172
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.040
So all these fucking casinos are building these giant square rooms and then

173
00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:43.420
they're,
they're fighting over,
you know,

174
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:48.421
the top Djs to get them there and they like doubling the asking prices and all

175
00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:53.950
that.
It's going through the fucking roof.
And it's literally reminding of,

176
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.960
<v 1>uh,
the standup comedy boom when they start,
when they,</v>

177
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.050
cause like right now they have more rooms than they actually have legitimate

178
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:04.660
people that can fill up the rumps and they,
they pack in like five,

179
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:07.780
6,000 people a night.
Um,

180
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.660
but I guess that's down from like seven,
8,000.

181
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.870
And it's the exact same thing that,
um,

182
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.430
I can't say I saw it in stand up comedy,
but right when I started standup comedy,

183
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:26.290
I started in March in 1992.
Yeah,
I know I'm old.
Um,

184
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.330
they,

185
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
they had basically at that point the fallout had already begun from having more

186
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:37.390
comedy clubs.
Then you actually had comedians.

187
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.280
So what happens is obviously then you just start anybody with a pulse,

188
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.660
they just start sticking up there behind the microphone,
go and you know,

189
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.560
watch the deal with everything.
Right.
And um,

190
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.210
and the,
and it just went down the shitter and I just don't fucking get why they,

191
00:12:57.211 --> 00:13:01.220
they,
they just,
they keep doing this.
It's like you've got a great thing.

192
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.850
Edm,
electronic dance music,
I guess is what it's called.

193
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.310
And uh,
well I guess,
yeah,
because if you don't have it,

194
00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:11.780
there's a bunch of old people like me

195
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.520
at your fucking casino.
It's,

196
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.920
I've never seen the distance between young people and old people greater in the

197
00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:30.400
entire time that have been coming out to Las Vegas,
which has been,
um,

198
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.480
since the late nineties.
I've never seen it bigger,

199
00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:40.481
but used to see a decent mix of people in the casino and then like certain

200
00:13:40.851 --> 00:13:43.730
places like the hard rock cafe,
casino,
whatever the fuck they call it,

201
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.290
that was like the place to go.

202
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.850
And you went in there and there was a bunch of young,

203
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.670
young kids in there and by kids I just meet people in their twenties.
Um,

204
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.290
but basically all the other ones were kind of like,
you know,

205
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.210
it was a decent fucking mix of people and there were people gambling and now I

206
00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:04.890
don't know the tables and shit with dead.

207
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.870
Granted it's a fucked up time to come out here.
Hockey and basketball are over.

208
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:14.100
So a lot of the sports books are kind of drying up.
But like,
um,

209
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.630
it's going to be interesting to see when this bubble bursts exactly what is

210
00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:21.780
going to happen and what the fuck they gonna they don't give a shit.

211
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.150
I was going to say what they were going to do with their rooms,

212
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.590
those giant square rooms,
what they can turn them into.
Um,

213
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.090
so right now,
yeah,
you basically have ventriloquists or that fucking that,
that,

214
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.220
uh,
Edm music out here and uh,

215
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.440
<v 5>yeah,</v>

216
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.900
<v 1>I dunno man.
It's,
it's a,
uh,</v>

217
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.440
I,
I just,
that,
that thing is going to,
that thing is going to fucking nose dive.

218
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.980
It's going to knows that.

219
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.640
<v 0>I mean,
you gotta be thinking that as you just keep building another room.</v>

220
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.090
We'll give him 50 mil,
we'll give them 60 million.

221
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.430
This is like what the red sox and Yankees did the next thing enough.
You know,

222
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.580
you got Eric gynae up their fucking way,
pa people bull pull,
well blah,
blah,
blah,

223
00:15:08.581 --> 00:15:10.600
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
doing that shit.

224
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.440
Then it's over there.
One day somebody just stands back and goes,

225
00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:19.890
what the fuck are we doing?
But you got to do it.
That's what you,
you know,

226
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.210
back when I was coming up,

227
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.830
it was that hair metal shit and everybody blew out their hair,
right?

228
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.360
Said something about the devil.

229
00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:31.260
And then you had a little fucking ballad and then you shot the ballot right in

230
00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:33.510
the ballad was always in black and white in the beginning.

231
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.060
And then when the guitar solo finally came in,
um,

232
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.270
that's when it went into color.
They just ride it into the fucking ground.

233
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:44.850
I think that's what you do on that side of the business.
You see a trend,

234
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.650
this is where the money's going and you just fucking jump on that horse.

235
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.810
You don't stop for water.
You just ride that thing until it fucking,
it dies.

236
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.860
Then you get off the fucking thing and you act like you,
you,
you,

237
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.350
you never rode the horse
job.
Dude,
I don't know,
Edm.

238
00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:07.530
I can't even listen to that shit even though you made like a zillion fucking

239
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.820
dollars off of it.
So,
uh,
I don't,
I know I'm obviously in way over my head here.

240
00:16:11.821 --> 00:16:13.020
I don't know what I'm talking about,

241
00:16:13.021 --> 00:16:15.780
but I found it really fascinating and I got to tell you,

242
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.170
I'm happy for all those Goddamn g Djs,
you know.
I mean,

243
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.600
you know what's great about their,
their uh,

244
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.280
they're like standup comedy bubble here.

245
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:28.010
This thing that they're fucking writing is they are making money.

246
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.940
They're going to be set for life.
All right?

247
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.240
So if there's any Goddamn djs listened to this fucking thing,

248
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.360
I better not see you on some behind the music thing,

249
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.810
talking about how you're blue.
You're $50 million a fucking year.

250
00:16:41.811 --> 00:16:44.180
You should be set for life.

251
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.250
<v 5>Okay?</v>

252
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.000
<v 0>Oh my God.
If I made 50 million in one fucking year,</v>

253
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.930
you figure out,
right?
You got to,
you given away 10 year agent tender,

254
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.020
your manager,
that's 10 million,

255
00:16:58.021 --> 00:17:01.080
now you're down to 40 million and the government's gonna come in and they're

256
00:17:01.081 --> 00:17:04.200
going to fucking wacky for at least half that.

257
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.350
So you still got like 19 million bucks.

258
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.380
Just go out and just buy a $5 billion piece of per hour.

259
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.000
But then what he,
then he got to pay the property taxes on that

260
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.480
someday when the DJ shit ends

261
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.790
by like $1 million house and Allah fucking Bama,

262
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.853
right?

263
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.830
Go down there in Alabama where everything's fucking cheap or Arkansas or

264
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.420
something like that.
And just by yourself,
a big spread,

265
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.120
pay the fuck are rough.

266
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.880
And then when the whole thing goes into the shitter and nobody cares about that

267
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:45.620
music anymore cause it's,
you know,

268
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:49.560
you got to wait 20 years until it becomes cool again because it goes down the

269
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:53.070
shitter and then the next decade they got to have their own personality.
So they,

270
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:56.490
they got to hate on the,
the decade before.
But the decade before,

271
00:17:56.491 --> 00:17:59.940
the decade before is always considered cool.
Right?
Like right now,

272
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:04.590
slowly the 90s are going to start coming back,
you know,

273
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.100
like in the nineties and the eighties when I was coming up,

274
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.300
everybody was into the 60s and everyone thought the 70 sucked with disco and

275
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:14.250
soft rock don't all that fucking shit.

276
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.730
And then in the 90s all of a sudden the 70s became cool again.
Right.

277
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:20.550
And there was all these movies like Boogie nights and all of that fucking stuff

278
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.690
and all this disco music that everybody loved and then hated.

279
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.580
Then they loved it again.
So uh,
this,
as I'm calling this right now,

280
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:30.331
like Paul brosy,

281
00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:34.320
this Dj music is going to be considered the shit by a certain segment of the

282
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:39.000
population.
Okay.
In the 2027 and be like,

283
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.750
oh my God,
it's fucking awful.
Emperor's new clothes,
what was going on?

284
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.320
And everybody stood there with glow sticks pumping the fist and the fucking air

285
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.030
and then a,

286
00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:53.031
the hipsters of the 2030 of the 30 step basically going to be like a,

287
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.690
I dunno,
I dunno what the fuck they going to do.

288
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.580
There'll be walking around with the mouse heads on,

289
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.850
on top of the fucking hence Gi bill.
That's really insightful.

290
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:06.940
So you mean like nothing's going to change in the future?
Yeah,

291
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.940
that's basically what I'm saying.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right.

292
00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:13.420
This is the Monday morning podcast.
Uh,
if you're new to the podcast,

293
00:19:13.421 --> 00:19:16.630
this is about as good as it gets.
I hate to tell you this is,

294
00:19:16.631 --> 00:19:21.160
this is what I'm bringing to the table and um,
so if you want to leave,

295
00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.800
I totally understand.
And with that,

296
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.720
let's read some advertising for this week.
What do we got here?
Oh,

297
00:19:28.721 --> 00:19:33.100
we only got a couple slowly but surely pissing all of them off.

298
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.620
Can we get she,
can we get bill on the phone?

299
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.420
There was a few things that he said last week.
Can we get him on the phone?

300
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.820
No.
No you cannot.

301
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.850
You cannot get me on the phone cause it's my fucking podcast and that's why I do

302
00:19:48.131 --> 00:19:51.810
this.
So I don't have a boss so I don't have to get on the phone.
You,
you want,

303
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.630
you write it on a fucking posted and you let me know what you didn't like and

304
00:19:55.631 --> 00:20:00.430
then I won't read it.
All right.
Hulu plus everybody you've probably tried,

305
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.360

308

309
00:20:16.361 --> 00:20:21.010
What if they had Hitler plus,
you know for people who Hitler.

310
00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:21.844
Was it enough?

311
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.260
Dude,
I'll do you one better.

312
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:32.030
I don't think that guys got far enough introducing Hitler plus.
All right,

uh,
what did he say that the uh,

365
00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:43.330
the fucking,
uh,
the advertising for this week?
Um,
all right,

366
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.920
back to the,
uh,
back to the podcast.

367
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:51.170
So evidently in the soccer world,

368
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.813
um,

369
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:57.910
the u s is going to be playing Belgium tomorrow in World Cup soccer.

370
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.580
And I got to tell you,
it's going to be a bud burner though.

371
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.260
You know what's amazing?
We advanced to the next round and we lost.

372
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:09.680
We lost to Germany.
We lost to the crouch.

373
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.010
<v 5>Okay.</v>

374
00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.760
<v 0>You know we lost to a country that didn't get,</v>

375
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.310
couldn't tell that Hitler maybe was a little bit off.
That's what we did.

376
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.760
That's what we did on this weekend.
Now you got,

377
00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:24.190
you can't tell me in any other fucking sport

378
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:30.040
when you lose to the country that gave us Adolf Hitler,

379
00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:34.120
you are out of that tournament but not in World Cup soccer.

380
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.810
We literally lost the game and I was sitting there go,
fuck.

381
00:24:37.811 --> 00:24:41.230
We lost the game and all of a sudden our whole team is smiling and clapping.

382
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.173
<v 5>You know,</v>

383
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:49.770
<v 0>we lost to the country that gave us Rudolph Hess.
You know,</v>

384
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.800
and what happens,
we all start fucking clapping
and somehow,

385
00:24:55.801 --> 00:24:56.130
I dunno,

386
00:24:56.130 --> 00:25:00.900
we ended up advancing because Turks and Caicos last a Cucamonga.

387
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.850
So now we move on.
All right.
And to be fair to Germany,

388
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.560
I got to tell you,
I don't think anything makes up for the Nazis,

389
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.340
but damn close is the Mercedes Benz and the Porsche.

390
00:25:14.341 --> 00:25:18.750
I got to tell you their cars,
the cars are fucking incredible.

391
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.760
And by the way,
if you guys want to write into the podcast,
um,
and you want to,

392
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.820
you know,
send in a question or maybe help me with some of my,
uh,

393
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.820
my World Cup football knowledge here.
Uh,

394
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.080
the email is bill at the m podcast.
Um,

395
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.980
that is the email and if you'd like to follow them on Monday morning podcast,

396
00:25:37.981 --> 00:25:41.570
see all the links and all that type of shit,
just go to the MM,
uh,

397
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.140
at the MM podcast on Twitter.
Sorry.
Anyways,
plowing ahead.

398
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:51.690
Um,
so somehow we made it to the next round to the round of 16.

399
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.700
Now as far as I know,

400
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:58.860
I don't think we've ever advanced beyond the round of 16.

401
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.550
Maybe back in the 1930s shit,
we maybe even want it.

402
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.900
I don't think we did back when they played soccer and they wore like suspenders,

403
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.040
the hold up their trousers,
you know,
people had homemade shoes.

404
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.980
Um,
I dunno.
Uh,
so anyways,
replaying Belgium,

405
00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.770
and this is another one where I'm just like,
you know what?

406
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.690
How the fuck can we lose to a country that can't even come up with an original

407
00:26:24.691 --> 00:26:25.524
flag?

408
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.390
Their flag is basically Germany's flag and they just turned it,
you know,

409
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.110
to the side rather than having the bars going horizontal,

410
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.290
they just haven't gone right side up.
As far as I know,
when I look at it,

411
00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:41.990
that to me that's the German flag.
I didn't realize it's Belgium,
you know,

412
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.410
<v 1>it's called the officially the Kingdom of Belgium.</v>

413
00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:48.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.290
<v 1>It's a federal monarchy in western Europe.
It's a monarchy.</v>

415
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:55.830
So I mean is it even a goddamned country?
The fuck is a monarchy.

416
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.980
Isn't that when like one guy is somehow running everything?

417
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.510
A monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually a nominally

418
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.560
nominally embodied in a single individual.
Yeah.
The monarch.

419
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.010
So rather than a president,
so who do you have?

420
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

421
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.200
<v 1>Now Jesus,
look at it.
All of these fucking people.</v>

422
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.250
Good Lord.
Good Lord.

423
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.870
<v 2>Okay,</v>

424
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.570
<v 1>that's not a fun page.
Um,
so who the fuck's your monarch?</v>

425
00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.770
So no matter what this guy does,
this dude stays in office.

426
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.030
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
There is no fucking way we're losing to this,
this,

427
00:27:36.031 --> 00:27:40.600
this kind of day.
They got one guy,
they make big,
you know,
it's overrated.

428
00:27:40.601 --> 00:27:44.860
Belgium bear at least the shift that we have over here.
It's too God damn sweet.

429
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.460
These fucking hipsters walking around drinking it,

430
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.820
these giant bottles of the shit.
I'm just kidding.

431
00:27:51.821 --> 00:27:55.480
I would actually love to go to Belgium and uh,
but as far as I know,

432
00:27:55.481 --> 00:27:58.540
John Claude van Damme and the battle of the bulge,

433
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.960
those are the two things I know about Belgium.
And now I know that you guys,

434
00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.250
you live under a monarchy.
Um,
historically Belgium,

435
00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:10.960
the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
We're also known as the low countries.

436
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.040
Oh Shit.

437
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.320
If fucking they would demand trash talking.
You've,

438
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.720
which used to cover a somewhat larger area.
Wait,

439
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:26.721
what are the low countries makes up a coastal region in Northwestern Europe.

440
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

441
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.470
<v 1>Oh,
that's great.
So that's,</v>

442
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.630
that's considered low to me geographically.

443
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:37.050
When I look at a map and you talking low,
that's the southern hemisphere.

444
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.710
I know.
I'm a moron.
A who gives a shit?
You know,

445
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.480
I really thought it was going to be able to look at this guide.

446
00:28:43.481 --> 00:28:48.000
The ampage here on Youtube.
On Youtube.
I mean on a Wikipedia.

447
00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.250
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

448
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.720
<v 1>So what have they done here?
History.
Politics,
geography,</v>

449
00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.220
economy,
military.

450
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

451
00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.490
<v 1>Now at some point they had to be running shit.</v>

452
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.110
Some point everybody was running shit,
right?
Military,

453
00:29:03.111 --> 00:29:07.040
the Belgian armed forces have about 47,000 active trips.

454
00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:11.510
All that's adorable.
In 2010 Belgium's defense budget total.

455
00:29:11.511 --> 00:29:13.520
3.95 euros.

456
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:17.420
Jesus Christ.
Dude,

457
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.910
I know like 10 comedians that could pay for their entire military budget.

458
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:29.210
Those fucking Dj's,
those God Damn Djs,

459
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.563
<v 2>they could,</v>

460
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.030
<v 1>they get to like five shows over there.
That's how,</v>

461
00:29:37.031 --> 00:29:41.230
that's how you survive when the bubble bursts on the fucking Edm,
uh,

462
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.070
music bubble

463
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.500
<v 0>there is,
you just during this time,</v>

464
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:48.400
you donate to the Belgium armed forces and you pay for him and then you'll be,

465
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:52.640
you'll be like David Hasselhoff in Germany.
Like you'd just be famous forever.

466
00:29:52.641 --> 00:29:55.180
A Jerry Lewis and France.
Anyways,

467
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:59.500
he said they are organized into one unified structure,

468
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.120
which consists of four main components,
land component or the army.

469
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.920
Okay.
The air force,
the navy and the medical component.

470
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:15.770
All right.
The effects of World War II made collective security a priority.
Well,

471
00:30:15.771 --> 00:30:17.120
Jesus Christ,
you didn't figure that out.

472
00:30:17.121 --> 00:30:21.800
If the first one even France made the Maginot line just didn't work so well.

473
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.060
They just kind of flew over it.
Um,
in March,
1948,

474
00:30:26.061 --> 00:30:30.530
Belgium signed the Treaty of Brussels and then join NATO in 1948.

475
00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.101
However,

476
00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:35.930
the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the

477
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.720
Korean War.
The Belgians along with the Luxembourg government

478
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.100
<v 1>sent it detachment of battalion strength of 50 Korean.</v>

479
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.280
<v 0>Yeah.
They're basically not doing shit over.
There is no fucking white dude.</v>

480
00:30:47.281 --> 00:30:51.240
If you only got three and a half million people in your armed forces are,

481
00:30:51.241 --> 00:30:52.710
y'all used to only spend that much money,

482
00:30:52.711 --> 00:30:56.130
you get 48,000 people and you're armed forces.

483
00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.190
I mean,
that's such a small pool to pick from,
dude.

484
00:31:01.191 --> 00:31:06.080
This is going to be an absolute fucking disgrace if we lose.

485
00:31:06.081 --> 00:31:09.590
This is like losing to,
they've liked the United States.
Okay.

486
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.620
The collective talent of the United States played like Kentucky.

487
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.650
There's no way we could,
I'm definitely watching this fucking game.

488
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.630
It's on at 9:00 AM tomorrow.
I think I'll be flying.
You know what?

489
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.530
I guess I've got to sign up for Hulu plus over there.
Um,

490
00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:30.170
so anyways,
let's get back to Vegas out here.
I uh,
had a great time last night.

491
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.850
I did a surprise,
not so surprised.
Um,
guest spot

492
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.590
<v 1>and uh,
on the fucking</v>

493
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.990
<v 0>what the fuck?
The uh,
the all the all tour.
Sorry guys.</v>

494
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:48.610
You can you tell I've been drinking again.
Drinking again.
Oh baby.

495
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:52.540
I'm drinking again.
I went 73 fucking days with that,
without the booze

496
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.760
<v 1>and uh,
Versie Bart,</v>

497
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.860
nick in law had all came in Saturday night after,
um,

498
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.610
my second show over here at the Mirage.

499
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.700
And uh,
I came back to my room and I was waiting for them.

500
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:13.120
They were on their way up.
Kevin Shay opened for me.
All right,

501
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.090
so all,
all the fucking maniacs.

502
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:21.091
We're out here and I'm sitting there with the lovely Nia and she's going,

503
00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:25.360
I'm tired.
I'm like,
I'm tired too.
I swear to God,
if these guys weren't in town,

504
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:31.020
I would just go to bed and they showed up.

505
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:36.570
We had a couple of drinks and some cigars sitting on the table and I go to my

506
00:32:37.571 --> 00:32:39.070
wife,
hey,
you know,
like,
well it's just,

507
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.540
we're just going to go outside and smoked a cigar.

508
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:44.880
I'll be back in a couple hours or whatever.
And that was like it.

509
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:45.970
<v 5>Okay.</v>

510
00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.670
<v 1>I don't know what that was.
That was probably just a little bit after midnight.</v>

511
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:53.140
Okay.
And I don't,
you know,
I started drinking and I just became that guy,

512
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.860
that guy who just wants to keep going and does not want to go home and uh,

513
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.260
Barton English joke and said what we did was basically they could have shot a

514
00:33:02.261 --> 00:33:06.340
commercial for Las Vegas is what we did.
Um,
I hate to say it.

515
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.300
We did an,

516
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.280
we just did old school Vegas shit that was not old school when I first started

517
00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:13.031
coming to Vegas,

518
00:33:13.031 --> 00:33:17.440
but I've been out here for 15 years and like the new school's going to their Dj

519
00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.290
Shit.
So
I even know what the fuck we did.
We some,

520
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.930
I think we ended up over the Venetian

521
00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.230
<v 0>and uh,</v>

522
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.160
<v 1>we were already smoking cigars.
I don't really even remember.
I was just pounding.</v>

523
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.840
Well,
where are we?
I played roulette somewhere

524
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.940
<v 0>and I made money and I cashed out.</v>

525
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.980
Then we went over to the v Venetian.

526
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.990
<v 1>I remember playing craps,</v>

527
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.550
throwing the dice.

528
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:52.400
<v 5>Okay.</v>

529
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.040
<v 1>And it just kept going.
Hey,
instead of yelling,
and everybody's saying,</v>

530
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:56.870
I'm throwing numbers over here.
Right.

531
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.010
I just started throwing and I did what I always did.

532
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:04.910
I bet the 68 in the past bar,
I should have bet the point.
I hit the point twice.

533
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.540
I threw like fucking,
I dunno,
1215 numbers in a row.

534
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.460
<v 0>You know,
I was</v>

535
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.221
<v 1>bullshit,
man.</v>

536
00:34:12.221 --> 00:34:16.000
I had like five bucks on each fucking thing or whatever I made and I made a

537
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.620
couple hundred bucks cause I was too drunk to realize like,
Phil,

538
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.610
you know what you're feeling it,
why not throw down a little bit more,

539
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:24.910
but I didn't.
I just remember people on the other end of the table,

540
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.750
well going,
hey,
you're built bar.
You're thrown die.
I go,
that's right.

541
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:31.970
They're buttoned down.
Throwing numbers,

542
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.760
<v 0>Talk Shit.
Oh it was Alvin.</v>

543
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:41.840
A hell of a type tip and people doing what you're supposed to do.

544
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.600
Laughing my ass off.
I made money.
I went back over,

545
00:34:47.601 --> 00:34:52.370
cashed out.
I had like fucking three $100 bills in my pocket.

546
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.300
I have just starting off with my old hybrid,
so I guess it was up 200 bucks.

547
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:59.900
Now all of a sudden this shady dude comes up to us who had this weird little

548
00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:04.790
sodas,
zipper scar on his nose and he's handing us a fucking flyer.

549
00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.190
All wait,
somewhere in there.

550
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:10.130
I met these two agent chicks and I talked them back into their dreams.

551
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:15.650
I can't answer that.
I'm just one girl.
She was an accountant.

552
00:35:15.651 --> 00:35:20.090
She wanted to be in fashion.
And I was like,
so go do that.
He's like,

553
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:21.950
do you really think I carrot Mike?
Yeah,

554
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.660
you totally can just keep your day job and just start working on the fashion

555
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:29.810
thing and then eventually fashion thing will surpass your other thing.

556
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.220
She was like,
you're so awesome.
And all I'm thinking in my head is,

557
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.950
this is why that fucking

558
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:42.330
was able to buy where the Houston Rockets used to play and go in there and talk

559
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:46.800
about Jesus.
What the fuck is that guy's name?
You know that guy,
you know?

560
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.570
Oh,
what is his fucking name?
He's got the squinty eyes.

561
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.690
He closes his eyes and he sits there.
You know,

562
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.780
Jesus wants you to have a popsicle.
He wants you to,

563
00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.360
all you gotta do is just tell people what they,
what they want to hear.

564
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.730
And I was totally sincere.

565
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:04.700
<v 5>Okay.</v>

566
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.800
<v 0>When I told this woman to go follow her dreams,</v>

567
00:36:06.801 --> 00:36:09.320
but I didn't really give her any sort of concrete plan.

568
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:13.610
All I did was just tell her that she could do it and it made it feel good.

569
00:36:13.611 --> 00:36:16.300
So I did do a good thing,
but you know something I,

570
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:21.080
if the bottom falls out of standup comedy,
that's what I'm going to,

571
00:36:21.081 --> 00:36:23.090
I'm going to turn into a motivational speaker.

572
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.010
<v 5>Okay.</v>

573
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.990
<v 0>I would absolutely crush it because I already know how to make people laugh and</v>

574
00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:33.260
then rather than being a negative content,
I would totally turn it.

575
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.090
I would finally take off like,
you know,
you don't want to,

576
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:43.100
spider man wears that black suit and he can't control it and he starts acting

577
00:36:43.461 --> 00:36:44.390
like a cunt,
you know,

578
00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.830
starts talking shit to women and spraying web web juice in their face.

579
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.040
Then he goes back to the classic red and blue and then he's like,
oh,

580
00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:55.700
I'm sorry about that,
sweetie.
Let me get that.
Oh my God,
the fucking iPhone.

581
00:36:55.701 --> 00:36:57.740
I get it.
I heard the first fucking won

582
00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:04.120
Jesus fucking Christ.
Why does it do that?

583
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.550
It ranks and then you don't pick it up.

584
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.300
I literally pushed the fucking button to say,
I don't want to,
you know,

585
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:13.000
it's funny,
some Dj that boom,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.

586
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:17.250
They could turn that into a hit song.
And if you'd be,
you know,

587
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:21.880
like they could blend that with guns and roses,

588
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.900
whatever the fuck it,
that's sweet child of mine.
Which by the way,

589
00:37:25.901 --> 00:37:29.710
I heard the blending of that last night at this bar that I was at and I

590
00:37:29.711 --> 00:37:33.310
literally thought that somebody had put on two fucking stereos at the same time.

591
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.090
Stereos.
That's how old I am.
And I gotta be honest with you,

592
00:37:37.091 --> 00:37:41.800
it sounded like absolute shit that was not a good example of that.

593
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:48.070
Uh,
it's fucking annoys the shit out of me when young kids think that,

594
00:37:48.071 --> 00:37:49.120
that's fucking amazing.

595
00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:55.980
When somebody blends this album with that album and they can't fucking believe

596
00:37:56.201 --> 00:38:00.940
it,
like,
Oh shit,
how did they do that?

597
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:05.650
It's like,
well,
you're basically,
you find two songs that are the same tempo,

598
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:11.770
you know,
that's all you need.
If they're the same tempo,

599
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.470
they'll all fit.
That's it.

600
00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.150
So that's your homework this week.
Some up and coming Dj,

601
00:38:22.151 --> 00:38:22.990
I want you to have a hit.

602
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.160
I want you to get out here to Vegas and starts vacuuming up all this money that

603
00:38:27.161 --> 00:38:32.120
the thrown at these djs out here.
Take that fucking boop,
boop,
boop,

604
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:35.920
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
whatever the fuck that is,
you know,

605
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.970
and blend that with the Lawrence Welk,

606
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.130
Winchester Cathedral or whatever the fuck you want to do with it.
I don't,

607
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:44.440
I don't give a shit.
Um,

608
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.040
the hell was I talking about?
God dammit.

609
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.280
I was on my way to talking about something here

610
00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.800
that gives a fuck.
Let's just,
let's just,
let's just,
uh,

611
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.630
let's just plow ahead here.
Shall We?
Um,
by the way,

612
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.290
I've mentioned this before for both men and women.

613
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.560
There is a certain age will you just have to,

614
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.910
you got to act your age when it comes to dressing.
Okay.

615
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.530
Like right now,
I am in my mature years.
Okay.

616
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.630
And women my age are in their elegant years.

617
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.010
When you get past a certain age as a woman,
you should dress elegantly.

618
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:32.260
Do not try to dress like hotly,

619
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.310
I guess is the word.

620
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.070
And I should not try to dress like I'm still a fucking stud.
You know,

621
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.810
like,
I don't want to take a nap every day in the afternoon,
like after 1130.

622
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:47.110
I don't feel like just going back to the bed,
the bedroom,
you know,

623
00:39:47.111 --> 00:39:50.080
the hotel room,
whatever the fuck I'm trying to say.
Right?

624
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.000
Like I really want to stay out all fucking night
owl shit.

625
00:39:55.001 --> 00:39:56.440
I didn't finish that fucking story.

626
00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.180
So this guy with a Goddamn zipper stark scar on his fucking nose,

627
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.670
he convinces us to go to a titty bar,
which really wasn't difficult.

628
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.160
And next thing you know,
we're in this fucking titty bar and on.

629
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:16.360
These women were really God damn aggressive.
Like the second you sat down,

630
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:21.190
one of them sat in your lap and I was like,
it was really,
I'd be honest with you,

631
00:40:21.191 --> 00:40:24.970
it's fucking suffocating.
I actually just kind of like,
Hey,

632
00:40:24.971 --> 00:40:27.850
can you fucking let me just get my bearings here

633
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.520
before you put,
quit trying to shake your tits?
They're fake.
They're not moving.

634
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:39.090
All right,
what do you do next?
Shake your elbow.
Um,

635
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:45.250
so anyways,
we're in this fucking place.
And,

636
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:49.790
uh,
I dunno,
I mean,
we're all guys,

637
00:40:49.791 --> 00:40:53.120
we don't give a fuck.
Next thing you know,

638
00:40:53.121 --> 00:40:57.290
it's like six o'clock in the God damn morning.
Six something.

639
00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.300
We came walking out,

640
00:40:59.301 --> 00:41:03.710
it was broad daylight and I'm sitting there like,

641
00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.140
the only thing I can relate it to was when I was playing up in Alaska,

642
00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.630
when,
uh,

643
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:16.340
when it was at one of those times a year where it had like 22 hours of sunlight

644
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.720
and you were inside the club and you drink it.
And it's about two in the morning.

645
00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:23.900
Like,
all right guys,
I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.
And then you would walk outside,

646
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:28.730
you'd open the door into broad daylight and immediately give body's clock.

647
00:41:28.731 --> 00:41:32.090
You would wake up,
he said at two in the afternoon,
two,
two at night.

648
00:41:32.091 --> 00:41:34.010
It seemed like two in the is

649
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.810
<v 1>the only way I could describe it.
And I walked out and,
uh,</v>

650
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.460
all I heard was Kevin Chaise.
Maniacal fucking laugh at like how light it,

651
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:49.130
it was out.
Um,
so that was my,
basically,

652
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:51.440
that was my first night out here.
And I gotta be honest with you,

653
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.280
I'm still recovering from it.
And that was two goddamn days ago.

654
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.650
Last night after a show,
I was just like,
I sat down and I got something to eat.

655
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.340
I had one Budweiser and then I went to bed and I was fucking psyched to come

656
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:10.010
back and go to bed.
So that goes back to what I was talking about.

657
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.760
So I have to dress maturely.
All right now,

658
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:15.830
like I was ever a guy walking around a tank top.
I didn't,

659
00:42:15.831 --> 00:42:20.150
I didn't have any fucking a pigment,
you know?
But I gotta tell you,

660
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:24.230
you go out on the pool.
Some people,
I don't know if they just have,
they just,

661
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.910
they can't see it or if they just don't give a fuck some of the shit that people

662
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:33.470
wear it down by God damn pool.
I mean

663
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.360
it's just like,
can you put that all of that shit away?
Can you put it away?

664
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:40.670
Half the people at the pool,

665
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:43.790
it should be wearing like one of those bathing suits from the roaring twenties,

666
00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:49.580
you know,
where it was.
Basically,
it was kind of a mechanic suit like that.

667
00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:51.680
Fonzie used to wear that one z zip up,

668
00:42:51.681 --> 00:42:55.490
except you would cut the sleeves off and you would cut the legs off.

669
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.450
That's what guys would wear.

670
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.120
And women wear the same thing and they'd have a little frilly thing going around

671
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:05.990
the outside.
Now
it's unreal,
man.

672
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.750
Oh Jesus.
And my generation,
oof.
It's ugly.
The tramp stamps,

673
00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:14.750
the Barb wire tattoo around your arm.

674
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:20.890
It's just a,
it's not a good fucking look.
It's just not a good look.
But anyway,

675
00:43:20.891 --> 00:43:21.410
so let's get,

676
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:25.280
let's get to some of the reeds here today because I'm actually going to go out

677
00:43:25.281 --> 00:43:29.960
with the fellas today and I think we're going to go shoot machine guns because

678
00:43:29.961 --> 00:43:31.370
why wouldn't you?
You know,

679
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.890
either that I'm going to look at some fucking classic cars,
one or the other.

680
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.420
All right,
let's get on with the,
uh,
the reach for this week.
Uh,
books.
Oh Jeez.

681
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.440
Oh Jeez.
Now you guys know better than to bring up books to me.

682
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.770
You really do.
Right.
All right.

683
00:43:45.771 --> 00:43:50.690
Billy Shakespeare and joys your last recommendation because I'm also a World War

684
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:53.900
II buff.
I'm currently reading Kevin Pollock's biography.

685
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.830
I have to lighten things up once in a while.
All right.
Also,

686
00:43:57.831 --> 00:44:02.360
you should have him on your podcast or be on his video podcasts.

687
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.180
Um,
well shit.
Yeah.
I mean,

688
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.350
if a fucking movie star wants me to be on his podcast,
yeah,
I would do that.

689
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.980
Anyways.
He says,
my question is,
do you have any new book recommendations?

690
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:21.650
Uh,
fuck.
I saw one the other day that made me want to read it.

691
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.170
What the hell was it?
Ah,
fuck.

692
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.670
I Dunno.
I can't keep track of it at the amount of shit that's is interesting.

693
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.100
Interesting me right now.

694
00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:37.083
<v 4>MMM.</v>

695
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.550
<v 1>Like now that I'm going to be home for July,</v>

696
00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:45.480
I really want to get in good shape and uh,

697
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.340
so I'm thinking about,

698
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:49.820
<v 5>yeah,</v>

699
00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.530
<v 1>you don't try to go veggie for a little bit,</v>

700
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:55.850
learn how to eat that way and then gradually work,

701
00:44:55.851 --> 00:44:58.970
meet back in.
But just in general,

702
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.450
just eating way more healthy than I than I have been eating in the past.

703
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.470
But I got to tell you last night that burger and fries off Jesus.
Was that good?

704
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.461
I mean,

705
00:45:07.461 --> 00:45:11.920
is there anything fucking better than just a straight up fucking cheeseburger?

706
00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.340
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

707
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.280
<v 1>With some French fries?
Well done.
Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

708
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:18.020
<v 5>Okay.</v>

709
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.060
<v 1>I mean,
I,
I swear if I was on death row,</v>

710
00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:25.280
I think that that would be my meal Burger and fries.
Well done.

711
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:30.070
And that's some fucking mint chocolate chip ice cream,
you know?

712
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.370
And then what's hilarious is as they're walking you down to the electric chair,

713
00:45:33.371 --> 00:45:37.520
you know,
you
play a place I'll do,

714
00:45:37.521 --> 00:45:40.570
or that you already got me in a cage.

715
00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:42.163
<v 4>MMM.</v>

716
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.580
<v 1>I don't know what I'd do.
I'd probably,
yeah,</v>

717
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:51.320
I think that maybe that's what I would have.
Oh yeah.

718
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.160
I'd probably have to have a beer too.
And a great glass.

719
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.210
That is so weird that you get the last fucking meal.
You know,

720
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.090
you obviously did something so fucking horrific that the other person did get a

721
00:46:02.091 --> 00:46:02.924
last meal.

722
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.380
<v 5>Okay.</v>

723
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.760
<v 1>Why do,
why?
Why do we do that?</v>

724
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.733
<v 4>MMM.</v>

725
00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:12.290
<v 1>So anyways,
yeah,
I've,
I've been looking at all kinds of shit.
Uh,
what is a foe?</v>

726
00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.153
What is the book?

727
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:15.890
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

728
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.260
<v 1>I should've,
I should've wrote it down.
It was yet again,</v>

729
00:46:18.261 --> 00:46:19.790
some new thing that interests me.

730
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:22.800
And it was a great book about the whole kind of history of it.
Yeah.

731
00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.513
<v 4>MMM.</v>

732
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.380
<v 1>Fuck.
What was it?</v>

733
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:28.800
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

734
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.360
<v 1>whatever.
If I remember,
I'll post it.</v>

735
00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.253
<v 4>MMM.</v>

736
00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.510
<v 1>Well that was really a fucking Dick Tease,
wasn't it?
I wasn't able to remember.</v>

737
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.100
All right.
You want me to call up to just answer it somehow.
What I'm,

738
00:46:43.101 --> 00:46:44.480
what I'm really into right now,

739
00:46:44.481 --> 00:46:48.380
what I'm trying to learn how to do is I'm trying to like all I know how to make

740
00:46:48.381 --> 00:46:52.400
his heart attack food.
So I actually looked up a thing here.

741
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:57.410
Keenan was salad light and healthy summer recipe.
I got to wait.

742
00:46:57.411 --> 00:47:01.010
Here was,
everybody calls me a fucking twinkle toes.
Um,

743
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.010
it actually looks fucking delicious.

744
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.610
It's a high source of protein and I got to tell you who the fuck doesn't want to

745
00:47:08.611 --> 00:47:11.370
be in shape.
You know,

746
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:15.240
and this is all of this stuff.
This is,
you know,
be a fuck a man.

747
00:47:15.241 --> 00:47:19.560
Eat a cheeseburger.
You're fucking dose,
right?
Yeah.

748
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:23.940
But a keen was salad,
but I'm telling you,
if you make this shit,

749
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:27.550
you just got it sitting in your fridge and red is,
you're starting to get hungry.

750
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.100
If you just shovel some of that down your throat,

751
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.070
<v 0>all the bad urge is</v>

752
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:33.030
<v 5>yeah.</v>

753
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.120
<v 1>Are Now put it back and you're like,
oh thank God,
thank God I did that.</v>

754
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:39.930
Thank God I did that and I didn't fucking have the waffle fries,
you know,

755
00:47:39.931 --> 00:47:42.480
on top of fucking pancakes or whatever the fuck you gonna have.

756
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.380
<v 4>Um,
no I really want to,
uh,</v>

757
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.910
<v 1>you know,
rather than doing like a fad diet,
my wife,
you know,</v>

758
00:47:50.911 --> 00:47:54.120
she came out here for a couple of days and now she just went back cause now I'm

759
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:57.060
hanging out with the fellows and um,

760
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.850
she left this us weekly magazine

761
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.113
<v 4>and</v>

762
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.220
<v 1>there's a picture of j Lo on the cover says j Lo's new body at 44.</v>

763
00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.970
The single star kickstarted her diet with a 22 day cleanse.

764
00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:15.590
Get the fuck Outta here.
I ain't doing that now.

765
00:48:15.591 --> 00:48:18.720
Friends are already fixing her up with DWT.

766
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.860
Ss makes whatever the fuck that means.

767
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.990
Dances with the stars.

768
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.620
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
first of all,
her face,</v>

769
00:48:28.621 --> 00:48:30.750
she doesn't even look the same and she looks slightly Asian now.

770
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.023
<v 4>MMM.</v>

771
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:36.550
<v 1>But anyways,
she uh,</v>

772
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.510
she did some sort of Veggie diet and they had the website to it.

773
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:42.730
So I clicked on the link.
Don't,
I wouldn't have vegan thing.

774
00:48:42.731 --> 00:48:45.330
I want to learn how to do this shit.
I'd like to do,

775
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.740
I'd like to date a fellow from dancing with the stars.

776
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:55.650
<v 0>Oh.
With his little shorts.
Ah,
C'mon ob.
I'll spin you around the dance floor.</v>

777
00:48:55.651 --> 00:49:00.120
They had cliffy.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

778
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:04.830
I look it up and I go to the website and it's a bunch of those fucking stupid

779
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.290
<v 1>protein bars.</v>

780
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.030
<v 0>I don't know shit about nutrition.</v>

781
00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:14.620
I'm going to tell you those fucking protein bars and that God damn whey powder

782
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:16.990
and all of that,
none of that shit is good for you.

783
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.170
I'm going to go out on a fucking limb and say that there's going to be a bunch

784
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:23.980
of studies already saw Dr. Ross where they was saying that all that protein

785
00:49:23.981 --> 00:49:28.600
power on that way,
shit,
it's not regulated by the FDA food,

786
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:31.690
drug administration or whatever.
Right.
And even if it was

787
00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.680
half the fucking people who sit on the board of that used to work for like fruit

788
00:49:36.681 --> 00:49:39.410
loops and I know I'm overly simplifying that,

789
00:49:39.411 --> 00:49:42.980
but they basically have the nuts running the nuthouse like they've completely

790
00:49:42.981 --> 00:49:47.270
infiltrated all of that Shit,
these evil ass fucking corporations.

791
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.570
Um Oh shit.
That's what I can,
that's what I can

792
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:55.570
<v 1>commend reading.
I got this magazine and um,</v>

793
00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.840
it's just talking about,
you know,
basically the 10 worst corporations out there.

794
00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:03.570
And for me,
dude,
this is the real deal.
Shit,
I got to hit pause cause I,

795
00:50:03.571 --> 00:50:07.880
I want to show you guys his magazine here.
Where the fuck is my recorder?
Hang on,

796
00:50:07.881 --> 00:50:12.550
hang on,
hang on,
hang on.
Okay,
I'm back through the magic.

797
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.480
So the magic of technology and hitting the pause button.
I am back.

798
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.370
I'm putting on my headphones.
Hang on.
Here we go.

799
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:22.360
So the name of the magazine is called ad busters.
Terrible fucking name.

800
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.590
I understand that.
But uh,
this just has like a,

801
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.100
<v 0>you know,
it says something dumb and this issue of ad busters,</v>

802
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:33.560
we're going to do something that hasn't been done for over a hundred years.

803
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:37.460
We're going to kill off one corporation.
So already you're like,
oh,

804
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:42.080
GHGs and it says which one will it be and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,

805
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.990
but beyond that,

806
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:47.600
like they actually think that they're going to kill off a fucking corporation.

807
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:48.800
It's like,
no,
you're not.
No,
you're not.

808
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:51.950
This corporation is going to kill you and me way before you're able to kill it

809
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:53.990
off.
Um,

810
00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:55.750
<v 2>okay.</v>

811
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:57.360
<v 0>Does this match this magazine?</v>

812
00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:02.390
Absolutely fucking fascinating cover to cover and of all the shit and how out of

813
00:51:05.971 --> 00:51:07.350
control some of these,
these,

814
00:51:07.351 --> 00:51:12.240
these top corporations are not saying they're all bad,
but I am telling you like,

815
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:14.703
<v 2>okay,</v>

816
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:16.310
<v 0>this,
this right here,
to me,</v>

817
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:21.080
this is the real deal where everybody's on fucking TV and they sit there and

818
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:25.880
they're talking about Obama.
This or George Bush that and Democrat,

819
00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:27.770
Republican,
Conservative,
liberal,

820
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:32.840
all of that is a bunch of fucking,
it's just,
it's bullshit.

821
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:38.300
It's all bullshit.
Okay?
The president makes 400 fucking grand a year.

822
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.830
He gets another hundred grand for like food and travel,
something like that.

823
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:47.750
Okay.
And he's supposed to somehow keep in control.

824
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:51.500
People who are getting $10 million bonuses,
all right?

825
00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.040
This shit right here and these guys here,
these all these corporations,

826
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:56.510
all these banks and all this type stuff,

827
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:58.160
they got money on both sides of the ball.

828
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.970
It doesn't make a fucking bit of difference,
okay?

829
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.420
If the president is a Democrat to president as a Republican,

830
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:09.020
if the president is a libertarian,
it's president's a man,
a woman,
White,
black,

831
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:11.510
Asian,
it doesn't fucking make a pick a bit of difference.

832
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:14.250
They make 400 fucking grand a year.
All right?

833
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.750
And their job is basically to get yelled at.
That's their fucking job,

834
00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:22.560
to get blamed for everything that's going wrong.
And it's up.

835
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:26.750
I night 100% fucking believe that.
And if you don't believe that,

836
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:31.310
I think that you Europe,
yeah,
I,
I can't help you.
I can't fucking help you.
You,

837
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:34.970
you're an adult and you still believe in Santa Claus.
That's how I look at.

838
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
So that is what I am reading and that right there,

839
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:41.960
I'm going to read that shit and that's going to go into my five stupid fucking

840
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:46.220
brain.
And uh,
you know,

841
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:51.221
I already have a nice chunk that I'm starting to build for my next hour and a

842
00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:56.390
nice,
basically that's how I do it.
I just fucking,
I just,
I'll read shit on a,

843
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.900
Keenan was salad and then I'll read why Exxon is the most evil corporation

844
00:52:59.901 --> 00:53:03.970
fucking ever.
And then I just sort of mash them together like a DJ where,
where,

845
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:08.480
where,
where,
where,
where,
where,
where,
where,
where,
Oh my God.
How did he do that?

846
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:13.310
He put Keanu with salad next to Exxon.
Way,
way.
Whether there's a better blood.

847
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:17.750
I'm
sorry I don't have his fucking,

848
00:53:17.751 --> 00:53:20.480
that was even annoying to me and I love myself.
All right.

849
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.050
Dating a girl who was very hot and very,
very dumb.

850
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.340
Hey Billy banana split.

851
00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.780
I have an issue at some point I'm going to fucking list all the names,

852
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.560
the nicknames you guys have given me throughout the weeks here.
Um,

853
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.760
I have an issue with the girl.

854
00:53:35.761 --> 00:53:38.760
I recently started dating and I need some major advice.

855
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.810
I'm 25 years old and I met a 21 year old girl in my city.

856
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.810
She's way out of my league.
Don't have a say that.

857
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.140
Don't ever say that about yourself.
All right.

858
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:53.190
Your self esteem is not at the level that you need to date this woman.
All right,

859
00:53:53.191 --> 00:53:55.110
well maybe just be a nice,
she's way out of my league,

860
00:53:55.111 --> 00:53:59.400
but it's extremely fun to hang out with and can drink with the best of my guy

861
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:03.750
friends.
I used to question,
I used to get questions from my guy friends like,

862
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:04.680
dude,
seriously,

863
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.750
how did you get her a Europe big headed booze hound with the gut.

864
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.950
And she's actually good looking though.
This is great so far.
He goes,

865
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:18.000
well I think I may have found my answer.
She is extremely dumb.

866
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:19.830
Uh,
man,

867
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.450
that's like you find a classic car and the fucking engine has seized.

868
00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.440
You go to start it up and it just doesn't run.
You got to look at,
look at this,

869
00:54:29.441 --> 00:54:34.270
look at it,
look at that grill.
Anyways.
Well I think I may have found my answer.

870
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:38.230
She's extremely dumped.
For example,
at her work,
a tanning place.

871
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:43.570
She does word searches from kids,
kids books.
Oh No.

872
00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.000
You know the kind you find on a kid's menu at the,

873
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.210
at the all of Gad.
Um,

874
00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.750
oh my God.
She couldn't follow the plot of the movie.
The sandlot.

875
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.460
She's showing more and more signs that she is about as smart as your average

876
00:55:02.461 --> 00:55:06.240
eighth grader,
including not knowing what the word punctuation meant.

877
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.490
Should I look past it and keep dating her or move on to a girl I can actually

878
00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:14.700
have age appropriate conversations with.
I have a,

879
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:18.300
I'm having a lot of fun with her,
but this is starting to worry me.

880
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:22.170
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
All right.
Um,

881
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.940
you given me conflict.
I know she's beautiful and all that type of stuff.

882
00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.100
And then,
but then also you're saying that

883
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.500
you are having a lot of fun with her.
How,
what is the fun?

884
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:39.930
Is She legitimately fun to be with?
It makes you smile,

885
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:44.850
you know,
it makes you feel a little bit lighter.
You know,

886
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:46.830
you don't got the weight of the world on your shoulders.

887
00:55:46.831 --> 00:55:50.090
I mean that's a big thing.
But,
um,

888
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.370
if you're having fun with it cause she's hot and you think she's out of your

889
00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:58.350
league and you're enjoying having sex with her,
um,
look,

890
00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.970
as I saw it down at the Vegas Pool Countless Times this weekend,

891
00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:07.170
uh,
looks at the first thing that go.
So in the end of it,

892
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.550
you're going to want to have somebody that you can talk to and you can hang out

893
00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:13.650
with,
um,

894
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:20.130
you can be friends with and that type of thing.
So like,
look,

895
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:22.380
if she's a little ditsy or whatever,
I mean,

896
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.060
<v 5>okay,</v>

897
00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.970
<v 0>that's not the worst thing.
I mean,
if,
if maybe that's what you need,</v>

898
00:56:26.971 --> 00:56:28.170
someone's a little bit lighter,
but like,

899
00:56:28.171 --> 00:56:32.880
if she literally doesn't know what the word punctuation means,
um,

900
00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:35.070
<v 2>okay.</v>

901
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:35.903
<v 0>I,
you know,</v>

902
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:41.340
I understand your concerns because when you,

903
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:45.810
if you marry and you have kids,
like half of that brain is going into your kid.

904
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.290
Like,
I don't think I would want to be the smartest person in my family.

905
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:56.040
I would like everybody to kind of be on the same playing field.

906
00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:59.280
Uh,
and that is the thing.

907
00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:03.370
That is the thing when you go to marry somebody is uh,

908
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:09.390
you know,
whatever brain they have,
whatever skills they have,

909
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:13.500
like that's going to be 50%.
Like I've said that before,

910
00:57:13.501 --> 00:57:15.000
like with like Michael Jordan's son,

911
00:57:15.001 --> 00:57:17.610
like I bet he got a lot of shit cause he wasn't as good as his dad.

912
00:57:17.611 --> 00:57:22.200
And it's like,
that's not my fault that I'm 50% my mom,
you know,

913
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:25.260
it's like drugs that have been stepped on.
It's not pure cocaine anymore.

914
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:30.030
It's got a bunch of ex lacks in there.
So I would say,
um,

915
00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:34.920
it's beginning to worry.
Well,
MMM,

916
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:38.470
that doesn't sound like you're ready to break up with her yet.
I would,
uh,

917
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.670
I would keep an eye on those concerns.
I don't know,

918
00:57:43.671 --> 00:57:47.750
but you don't want to break her heart or anything.
You know what dude?

919
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.840
You know what you thinking.
Come on.
You know what you're thinking.

920
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:56.820
Either you could look past it because she's fun and she makes your day lighter,

921
00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.930
which is the greatest guy damn thing you can find,
you know,

922
00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:03.540
or it's really bugging you,

923
00:58:03.541 --> 00:58:06.330
but she's just hot and you're staying with the because of that.
But you know,

924
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:10.200
when I was at the down the casino,
this last night when I was at Caesars,

925
00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:15.180
I saw like a bunch of old people there and I saw a couple of old people walking

926
00:58:15.181 --> 00:58:16.860
by and they still,

927
00:58:16.861 --> 00:58:19.470
one of them had his arm around his wife and other one was holding their hands.

928
00:58:19.471 --> 00:58:21.720
And I remember thinking like that going,
that's fucking awesome.

929
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:25.890
That right there is what life is all about.
If you fucking can somehow get that,

930
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:30.270
you know,
the end of your life,
you still love the person that you're with,

931
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:33.900
you can go to Vegas and have a good time.
You know,

932
00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:40.080
it did it.
You hit the fucking lottery.
So good luck to you sir.
Um,

933
00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:45.350
I hope,
I dunno.
I,
I hope it works out for Yam root for your hair.

934
00:58:45.351 --> 00:58:49.370
We got pot smoking stepson.
Hey that Billy sizzle chest.

935
00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.710
I write a Jerky boys referenced and I like it.

936
00:58:51.711 --> 00:58:55.400
If you and the lovely Nia would address my question,
I would be honored.
Well,

937
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:58.610
she's back in La and I'm hanging out with the fellas.
Uh,

938
00:58:58.611 --> 00:59:03.611
I am the stepfather to a troubled in slightly delayed 16 year old think toddler

939
00:59:05.121 --> 00:59:09.800
mentality mentality,
tantrums with only a slightly more advanced intellect.

940
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:12.830
I confronted him last night after I smelled it.
The strength,

941
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:16.610
distinct aroma of weed coming from

942
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:22.220
hang on a VRC.
I'm wrapping up my podcast.
Me Call you in about 10 minutes.

943
00:59:22.221 --> 00:59:25.620
All right.
All right,
cool.
Um,

944
00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.300
shed if you will,
in the lovely Nia,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Um,

945
00:59:29.301 --> 00:59:33.170
I confronted him a him last night after I smelled a distinct aroma of weed

946
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:35.630
coming from the basement.
Oh,
Jesus.

947
00:59:35.631 --> 00:59:39.620
Previously I'd questioned him after he had mass it with,
uh,
with Cologne,

948
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.230
which he always denied.

949
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.880
He finally admitted his use and that he had been buying from a classmate,

950
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:51.770
his mother,
who am I loved dearly and with whom I have two kids of my own ages.

951
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.970
Six and eight seems to think that this is not a bad thing given what we have

952
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:59.240
endured with him.
Uh,
I won't go into all the details,

953
00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:03.710
but the cops have been to our house three times in the last six months for his

954
01:00:03.711 --> 01:00:07.880
violent behavior,
breaking shit in our house and threatening suicide.
Oh My god,

955
01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.020
though I think you need to talk to a professional here,

956
01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.610
tackling his mother and spitting in our faces.

957
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.700
His Dad beat him physically two years ago,
which is a,

958
01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:18.980
resulted in him cutting all,

959
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.950
all ties with that side of the family.

960
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.520
She objects to the prescribed medication and thinks that we could be the answer

961
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.700
to mellow out his ADHD or Asperger's.

962
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.080
I think it would only further complicate the PR problem and lead to a harder

963
01:00:36.081 --> 01:00:39.590
drug use.
We've been to multiple doctors and counselors,

964
01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:42.080
which have pretty much all suggested medication.

965
01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:45.800
We've even tried eastern medicine and now you don't have all the details,

966
01:00:45.801 --> 01:00:50.600
but am I right in my thinking?
I told him if he tests positive,

967
01:00:50.601 --> 01:00:53.840
he will be out of the house.
Ah,
Jesus,
dude,

968
01:00:53.841 --> 01:00:57.740
this is way beyond my shit.
Okay.
You need to talk to a professional.

969
01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.780
But having said that,

970
01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:03.350
if you want my opinion knowing full well that I am not a doctor,

971
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:08.090
I don't fucking know what I'm talking about.
Um,
I think this kid needs,

972
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:13.250
uh,
some understanding rather than threats at this point.
Uh,
I granted,

973
01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:16.610
I know he's attacked you physically and spit in your face and all that type of

974
01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:21.140
shit.
Um,
yeah,

975
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:22.580
I don't know what I would,

976
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:27.050
I mean personally I would rather he smoked weed then went on some fucking

977
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:32.450
medicine because all that shit is new and they don't know what it does to you

978
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:34.400
yet.
And uh,

979
01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:40.520
I'd be afraid if it was going to just kind of make them catatonic.
Um,

980
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:43.310
so I would really research whatever the hell are you going to have him put into

981
01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:47.660
his body.
But like,
I don't think that his acting out is crazy.

982
01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:52.010
I mean,
can you imagine that like your parents get divorced and trying to have a

983
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:55.190
relationship with your dad and your dad beats the shit out of you?
It,

984
01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.070
you're the only father who's supposed to love you unconditionally.

985
01:01:58.071 --> 01:01:59.280
Beats the shit out of you.
Like,
I don't,

986
01:01:59.281 --> 01:02:02.410
I don't even know how the Hell I could wrap my head around that.
Um,

987
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.420
and then he probably resent you because he wants his real dad,

988
01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:06.710
but then his real dad does love him.

989
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:11.490
The kids in a hell of a place mentally.
Um,

990
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.430
I know you have to be stern with them,
but I,

991
01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:17.570
I would maybe try to talk to them and maybe you could do this considering you're

992
01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:20.040
not his real dad.
Like,
just try to talk to

993
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.190
<v 1>a man demand and,
uh,</v>

994
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:28.710
just try to build some sort of relationship where,
uh,

995
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.030
it kind of opens it up where you guys can actually sit down and maybe you can

996
01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:37.420
share some of the shit that happened to him when you were a kid that

997
01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.220
disappointed you.
I don't,

998
01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.380
I don't know if it's going to pale in comparison to his shit,

999
01:02:41.381 --> 01:02:43.840
but a dude that's really beyond what the fuck I'm at.

1000
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.960
I can't help you necessarily,
but that,
but,
um,

1001
01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.390
I wouldn't be closed off to weed though.

1002
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:52.003
<v 5>You know,</v>

1003
01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.320
<v 1>I would much rather have a kid in mind smoking weed than to be on some sort of</v>

1004
01:02:56.321 --> 01:02:57.154
medicine.

1005
01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.733
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1006
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:05.150
<v 1>Look basically in life there's a line.</v>

1007
01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.250
Okay?
And you have the,
this illegal and legal,

1008
01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.950
all right?
But they're both the same.
You know,

1009
01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:19.120
like the smartest mobsters in the world went legit.

1010
01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:22.600
And what they did was they got onto the legal side of stealing.

1011
01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:28.150
So now you don't have to hide your money.
You don't have to wash it.

1012
01:03:28.151 --> 01:03:29.560
You don't have to come up with all this shit.

1013
01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:32.230
You don't have to have leg breakers.
Okay?

1014
01:03:32.231 --> 01:03:34.900
You don't need leg burgers anymore because the law is on your side.

1015
01:03:34.901 --> 01:03:37.570
When you steal,
you have the cops,
you have the court system,

1016
01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.680
you have all of that shit that we'll just go over and pick this person up and

1017
01:03:41.681 --> 01:03:43.600
handle it.
Um,

1018
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:48.840
and you can go out and go buy a big giant fucking house and you don't have to

1019
01:03:48.841 --> 01:03:51.180
worry about people going,
where did you get the money for that?
Okay.

1020
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:56.750
And that exists with extortion that exist with a like loan sharking all of that

1021
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:01.350
banking is just legalized loan sharking it's all the same fucking scam.

1022
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.610
And they don't need leg breakers anymore because they got the cops cause it's

1023
01:04:05.611 --> 01:04:06.444
legal.

1024
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:11.070
So the same thing is going on with like drugs and all of that type of shit.

1025
01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.180
These guys are legal drug dealers.
So now they don't have to have,
you know,

1026
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:19.710
fucking machine guns and all this type of shit looking out for the cops and all

1027
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:24.300
that that are on the legal side of this stuff.
And that shit is,
uh,

1028
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.030
you know,
like I mentioned before,
and the FDA,

1029
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:30.630
you have people on that board that used to work for these fucking drug companies

1030
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:35.380
and you know,
they get kickbacks,
look at these fucking presence,

1031
01:04:35.381 --> 01:04:37.420
but presence makes four or 500 grand fucking year.

1032
01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:38.950
And all of them are multimillionaires.

1033
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.040
And all of them at the end of their careers,

1034
01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:44.050
they go out and they give speeches for like $1 million a fucking night.

1035
01:04:44.051 --> 01:04:48.580
What the fuck can you say in an hour
that's worth $1 million?

1036
01:04:48.581 --> 01:04:49.480
You're giving a speech,

1037
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.190
you should almost have to pay somebody 1000 bucks to listen to her.

1038
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.560
Cause it's gonna be boring as shit.
But that's basically,

1039
01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:01.650
that is the legal kickback,
you know,
hey,

1040
01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:02.640
push this through.

1041
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:06.150
Look the other way so we can make this zillion dollars and get our yachts and

1042
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:07.770
then when you fucking leave office,

1043
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.190
we will then hire you at our company to talk for an hour.

1044
01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.390
We won't even listen when we looking at our fucking iPhones and when it's done,

1045
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:17.980
we're going to give you a sack of fucking money.
I mean that's

1046
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.940
<v 0>basic what's going on.
So when you go into the getting your kid on drugs,</v>

1047
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:24.640
you have to understand that that's the world that you're going into.

1048
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.060
And even though that it's legal and everybody has lab coats and they got degrees

1049
01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.990
on the walls,
it's,
it's still a filthy,

1050
01:05:31.991 --> 01:05:34.750
filthy fucking business and it's getting fucking worse.

1051
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.800
And that's why I'm telling you,
you're seeing people Odie and again,

1052
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:43.600
the way you did back in the 60s when the fucking,
the first sort of like pills,

1053
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:45.640
that wave of pills came out and everybody,

1054
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:50.290
like doctors would just prescribe them,
oh you got a nervous condition.

1055
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:52.570
And then they didn't know not to take them with alcohol.

1056
01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:57.571
It's like all these fucking people who are out dean out there like 10 years ago,

1057
01:05:58.791 --> 01:06:00.050
like wouldn't have oh deed.

1058
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.430
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1059
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:04.250
<v 0>In that way because all of a sudden there's these new fucking drugs and they're</v>

1060
01:06:04.251 --> 01:06:06.470
all coming through and they're all getting pushed through because it's a bunch

1061
01:06:06.471 --> 01:06:08.930
of fucking money at stake.
Okay.
And I know I'm a moron,

1062
01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:12.710
but that's basically what's going on.
So I would um,

1063
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.570
<v 5>okay.</v>

1064
01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.180
<v 0>And then I fell on the other side where weed is becoming legal.</v>

1065
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:19.310
It's becoming safer with like,

1066
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.730
<v 5>okay,</v>

1067
01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:23.880
<v 0>like if you want you to,
to smoke weed,
like I would get them like a,
uh,</v>

1068
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.500
I get them a vaporizer.

1069
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:32.210
So it's just the shit that he needs to get them high and if it mellows them out

1070
01:06:32.431 --> 01:06:34.170
and he's not going to flip the fuck out because,

1071
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.280
<v 5>okay.</v>

1072
01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.950
<v 0>What weeds doing whatever drug they're going to give you is kind of,</v>

1073
01:06:37.951 --> 01:06:41.880
kind of do the same thing,
right?
Just make this kid fucking relaxed.

1074
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:43.310
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1075
01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:46.550
<v 0>I know.
That's,
that's my 2 cents.
That's probably worth half a cent,</v>

1076
01:06:46.551 --> 01:06:51.260
but that's what I think on that shit.
All right.
Fresh start.
Yo,
Billie Jean.

1077
01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:54.500
I can,
I can really use your advice.

1078
01:06:54.501 --> 01:06:58.130
I'm 19 years old and have been a wreck since I graduated.

1079
01:06:58.310 --> 01:07:01.850
I can't land a job to save my life and all my friends,

1080
01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.630
all my friendships are down in the dumps.
My family,
uh,

1081
01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.530
my family is very religious,
so talking to them about this issue will go nowhere,

1082
01:07:09.531 --> 01:07:14.480
but Jesus and God,
Oh,
we'll go nowhere except,

1083
01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:15.680
but Jesus and God.

1084
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:17.240
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1085
01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.330
<v 0>so I'm asking you because at least you can give me a whole new look.</v>

1086
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.940
I really want a fresh new start in a new town,

1087
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.100
but don't know how to make a fresh start.

1088
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:28.820
I'm a loner type of guy because growing up I had no one to talk to because my

1089
01:07:28.821 --> 01:07:29.840
parents worked a lot.

1090
01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:34.520
So they would leave me at home alone after I came from school and I have no

1091
01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:39.350
siblings and most of my high school I got treated like,
Shit.
Jesus Christ,
dude,

1092
01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:44.150
I could really use your type advice,
what to do to get a fresh start to help me.

1093
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.080
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
All right,
here we go.
Okay.

1094
01:07:48.081 --> 01:07:51.710
So the fact that you're a loner,
that's actually a good thing.
In a way.

1095
01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.690
It's hurting you in certain areas.

1096
01:07:53.691 --> 01:07:57.680
But I also can help you as far as like being comfortable being alone actually

1097
01:07:57.681 --> 01:08:01.640
makes you strong.
All right?
But there's like with anything,

1098
01:08:01.641 --> 01:08:03.020
you have to do it in moderation.

1099
01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:07.130
So what I'm worried with you is you're going to go out and you want a fresh

1100
01:08:07.131 --> 01:08:08.290
start.
You thinking,

1101
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.940
I got to get out of this town because they have all these bad memories here.

1102
01:08:10.941 --> 01:08:15.050
So I need a fresh start.
That's a great thing to do.
All right?
But when you go,

1103
01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:20.740
if you keep the same mindset of isolating yourself and all that type of stuff,

1104
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:24.950
you're going to,
you're gonna if you don't change a game plan,

1105
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:29.600
it'd be like if you were a football coach and you lost the game in Florida,
okay,

1106
01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:32.900
you lost to the Miami Dolphins and next week you're going all the way to Seattle

1107
01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.300
to play the Seahawks,
but you're going to use the exact same game plan.

1108
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.490
You're gonna fucking lose again.
So,
uh,
if I was you,
I would try to open up more.

1109
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.740
Try to get some new friends as far as,

1110
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:44.623
<v 4>mmm.</v>

1111
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:47.820
<v 0>I would,
I would try to do something social,</v>

1112
01:08:47.821 --> 01:08:49.620
something that you like if you're into sports,

1113
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:51.960
join a softball league or something like that.

1114
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:53.730
If you're end up fucking rock climbing,

1115
01:08:53.731 --> 01:08:56.310
join a rock climbing gym and I'm all over the board here,

1116
01:08:56.311 --> 01:09:01.170
but basically get involved in some sort of group activity and,
um,

1117
01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:05.530
I don't know,
an open up to your friends and just be honest to say,
listen man,

1118
01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.180
I'm trying to be more social.
All right.
I grew up by myself.

1119
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:14.200
I didn't have a good experience and all this stuff.
He just told me,

1120
01:09:14.201 --> 01:09:16.540
you just tell people you don't dump it on them.

1121
01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:20.200
Like when you first fucking beat him,
just be matter of fact,
just me and yeah.

1122
01:09:20.201 --> 01:09:24.340
You know,
I gotta I gotta break out of this because someday I'd like to,
uh,
have,

1123
01:09:24.341 --> 01:09:28.930
uh,
you know,
wife and family or whatever,
you know,
but,
um,
as far as,

1124
01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.010
well,
I only way I can relate to moving and having a,

1125
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:34.710
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1126
01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:38.070
<v 0>a fresh new start.
Uh,</v>

1127
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.440
I would just compare to

1128
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.940
when I moved from my parent's house down in New York City,

1129
01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:49.170
what I basically did was I paid down all of my debt.

1130
01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.513
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1131
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.060
<v 0>And this took me couple of years.</v>

1132
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.770
I paid it all down and then I started saving up money.
And,

1133
01:09:57.771 --> 01:09:59.450
um,
so when I moved down to New York,

1134
01:09:59.451 --> 01:10:03.650
I had like this nest egg and I didn't have the stress and I could actually just,

1135
01:10:03.651 --> 01:10:05.240
you know,
jump in my piece of shit.

1136
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:10.490
83 Ford Ranger on a weight that they had burned down by that and went down in a

1137
01:10:10.491 --> 01:10:14.270
fucking u haul.
That's right.
And I just moved someplace

1138
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.090
and uh,
start it over again.
Um,

1139
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.360
I would encourage you to get,
try to force yourself to come out of your shell.

1140
01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:27.170
And you know what?
You can do that in your hometown.
You can actually create some,

1141
01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:32.030
uh,
some good memories from when you're there.
Uh,
you basically,

1142
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:36.020
you have all that power.
You just don't realize it because you're young,
you know,

1143
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.610
and you were a little kid and shit was bad and you don't have any frame of

1144
01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:41.030
reference.

1145
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:44.510
And your parents didn't give you any tools to learn how to overcome shit to

1146
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:48.050
think positively and all that type of stuff.
So I do whatever the fuck he could.

1147
01:10:48.051 --> 01:10:49.430
I would read self help books.

1148
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:54.580
I would just flood myself with positive thoughts and pay attention to what my

1149
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:58.610
brain was telling me.
And you turn that minus sign into a plus sign.

1150
01:10:58.611 --> 01:10:59.810
That's kind of what you gotta do.

1151
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:04.310
You gotta beat the shit out of that negative voice cause you kind of stuck in

1152
01:11:04.311 --> 01:11:06.950
this Rut is what I would guess.
Um,

1153
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.880
but the great thing is you're totally in control and you could fucking turn it

1154
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:13.110
around and uh,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1155
01:11:13.111 --> 01:11:16.340
It's a bitch took me a,

1156
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:20.730
it took me a long time to become the positive cunt that I am right today.

1157
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.700
But to learn how to make a keynote was salad.

1158
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:29.950
All right,
but not least is the last one here.
Fat Shaming won't work.

1159
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:33.780
A Billy bench press.
MMM.

1160
01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:36.201
Uh,

1161
01:11:36.201 --> 01:11:40.670
here's my conundrum and I need your help and maybe the help of the lovely Nia on

1162
01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:42.770
how to handle a situation with my wife.

1163
01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.920
My wife has been really down lately about her weight.
Uh,

1164
01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.020
she's probably put on 20 pounds in the past two years and is having trouble

1165
01:11:51.021 --> 01:11:55.370
getting rid of it before Nia jumps all over me.
Jeez.
Nia has a rep now,

1166
01:11:55.371 --> 01:11:59.810
half a jumping all over people.
Um,
let me state that,

1167
01:11:59.811 --> 01:12:03.770
not once have I made an issue,
made this an issue and I tell her all the time,

1168
01:12:03.771 --> 01:12:05.990
she's beautiful.
All right.
Her weight gain is,

1169
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:10.630
has not bothered me in the slightest as I barely noticed it.
Uh,

1170
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:14.660
the problem is it has killed her attitude and it's been the subject slash

1171
01:12:14.661 --> 01:12:18.290
starting point for many fights.
I get blamed for not helping her,

1172
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:20.570
even though I cook all healthy meals each day.

1173
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:24.890
And when I call her out for not going to the gym enough or reading the wrong

1174
01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:27.800
shit,
she flips out.
Uh,

1175
01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.900
I try to stay as positive as I can,

1176
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:33.980
but I can only take the verbal beating for so much more before I snap back and

1177
01:12:33.981 --> 01:12:36.530
tell her to stop blaming me for,
for her issues.

1178
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:41.030
Any idea I can handle this situation?
Not sure who I should turn to,

1179
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:45.200
but just,
uh,
but since she is a Gemini,

1180
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.710
I thought you were the man for the job.
Thanks for everything and go fuck,

1181
01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:50.260
fuck yourself.
All right.
This is what I would do.

1182
01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:53.950
I would go out to your local cvs or even that,

1183
01:12:53.951 --> 01:12:58.390
maybe a card store where you can write something original.

1184
01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:02.140
All right?
And get something nice and loving on the cover.

1185
01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.260
And then you write from your heart how much you love her on the inside.

1186
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:09.190
All right?
Something really quick.
And then you have an attached.
Nope.

1187
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:13.630
And in the note,
you basically in a calm,
positive way,

1188
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:18.880
express the fact that you're worried about her and you really want,

1189
01:13:18.881 --> 01:13:23.170
and it kills you that she's not happy and you love her.

1190
01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.430
So when she's not happy,

1191
01:13:24.431 --> 01:13:29.431
you're not happy and you want to help and you feel like basically where she's

1192
01:13:30.341 --> 01:13:30.760
at,

1193
01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:35.760
what you told me where she's at right now mentally is preventing you from

1194
01:13:37.451 --> 01:13:40.690
helping her and that you don't want to fight.

1195
01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:46.270
And this is the bottom I do.
It's only 20 pounds.
I mean,
that's a fucking joke.

1196
01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:51.190
You know,
she can get that off.
She just,
you know,
uh,

1197
01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:55.860
and obviously she wants to,
uh,

1198
01:13:55.930 --> 01:14:00.460
she sounds like a really strong person and most people who was strong,
you know,

1199
01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:04.780
their Achilles heel is the fact that they can't,

1200
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:08.020
you know,
if they've been strong their whole life,

1201
01:14:08.021 --> 01:14:10.750
when there's a sign of weaknesses shown,

1202
01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:15.751
they get insecure and super defensive and there's nothing out there that is

1203
01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:21.331
going to show you a weakness or a flaw quicker than putting on weight because

1204
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.690
it's not like,
okay,
this social issue that only comes up in a certain thing.
It's,

1205
01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.650
it's what you look like when you walk around.

1206
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:33.790
And I'm sure most of the world is not even noticing or whatever,
but to her,

1207
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.050
she sees it constantly.
So it's beyond just a pound thing.

1208
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.890
It's the mental fucking weight on her head.
So,
um,

1209
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:43.570
<v 5>okay.</v>

1210
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:45.970
<v 0>I would try to in a positive way,</v>

1211
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.710
opened the doors to some new line of communication and you really have to extra

1212
01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:54.580
be on your game because she might lash out at you.
Um,

1213
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:58.000
even if she's receptive to this,
she might go back to the other thing.

1214
01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.810
And it's going to be really hard,
but you,
what you,
you have to do,

1215
01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.210
considering she's losing her cool,

1216
01:15:04.211 --> 01:15:09.211
is you have to stay extra cool to kind of balance it out and just sit there and

1217
01:15:09.431 --> 01:15:11.950
let her yell at you and say all type of stuff.
And it just,

1218
01:15:11.951 --> 01:15:16.010
if you just sit there and you say nothing,
okay.

1219
01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:19.280
And you just let her go and you just sitting there and you wait for it to finish

1220
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:22.400
and you just,
rather than taking what she's saying personally,

1221
01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:23.890
<v 5>okay,</v>

1222
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:26.350
<v 0>you analyze it and just be like,
okay,</v>

1223
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.440
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1224
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.380
<v 0>right.
You know,
that's another example.
I'm not trying to nitpick.</v>

1225
01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:34.130
That's another example right there where I am trying to help you and I need you

1226
01:15:34.131 --> 01:15:37.160
to stay calm,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Um,

1227
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:41.300
you're not feeding the fire and it Kinda hopefully will just burn itself out.

1228
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:46.450
And,
um,
fortunately she's a woman.

1229
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.620
So I think she's going to be way more receptive to this line of,

1230
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:54.263
uh,

1231
01:15:55.690 --> 01:16:00.690
line of attack because it's socially acceptable for a woman to be weak or admit

1232
01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:06.340
to weaknesses.
Where a guy,
you know,
we're supposed to be fucking John Wayne,

1233
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:09.580
you know,
eating steaks a whole life,

1234
01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.030
sitting there with the fucking head won't go on.
It doesn't hurt,
you know,

1235
01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:17.980
so that's what I would do.
Um,
I would really,
um,

1236
01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:19.711
you know,

1237
01:16:19.711 --> 01:16:22.320
and then I'm not saying that you just have to sit there like a bitch either.

1238
01:16:22.321 --> 01:16:26.030
Like there will be times where you just have to sit up and just say,
listen,
uh,

1239
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.840
you saying a bunch of mean things to me right now,

1240
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:31.500
which is going to possibly cause me to say mean things back to you,

1241
01:16:31.501 --> 01:16:34.140
which I don't want to do.
So I'm going to go for a walk.

1242
01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.800
And when you calm down,
you know,

1243
01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.980
I would love to sit down this because I'm going to help you through this.

1244
01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.380
All right.
And just,
you know,

1245
01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:46.590
walk out as she's screaming and yelling at you and just go for a walk.

1246
01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:47.900
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1247
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.150
<v 0>You know,
just go for fucking walk.</v>

1248
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.780
Give her a good fucking two hours to calm down and then just come back.

1249
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.130
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1250
01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:57.821
<v 0>And sit down.</v>

1251
01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:01.090
And I wouldn't even bring it up and I'd wait for her to bring it up.

1252
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:02.520
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1253
01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.120
<v 0>And then just let her say a shit.
And I,
and I,
if you just keep doing that,</v>

1254
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.190
I think hopefully that'll,
that'll get you to where you want to be.

1255
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.440
I don't fucking know.
Um,

1256
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.220
but I definitely wouldn't do the fat shame thing that I do on this,

1257
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:20.290
this case scenario.
So anyways,
uh,

1258
01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.850
that is the podcast for this weekend.
Listen,
everybody,

1259
01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:26.090
I really want to promote this thing because it helps the all things comedy

1260
01:17:26.091 --> 01:17:28.940
network and he tickets that we sell.
Help us to run the,
uh,

1261
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.890
the all things comedy network.
Um,

1262
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.440
we do have some tickets left for the show tonight.
I'm sure the show tomorrow,

1263
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:41.230
July 1st at nerd melt.
Um,

1264
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:44.390
come on down.
It's going to be a great show.
Going to interact with the crowd.

1265
01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.290
We're going to be raising money for some fucking charity,

1266
01:17:48.291 --> 01:17:50.390
which I of course don't know.
I don't have the information,

1267
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:53.510
but it's going to be great.
It's a great way to kick off your July.

1268
01:17:53.511 --> 01:17:55.760
Come on down to nerd melt on sunset.

1269
01:17:56.030 --> 01:18:00.750
We're going to have the link up and all that type of Crappola.
Um,
that is it.

1270
01:18:00.751 --> 01:18:03.920
And we'd love to sell out the first one.
Okay.
That is it.

1271
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.000
That is a podcast for this week.
Go Fuck Yourself,
Belgium.

1272
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:12.200
You make great beer.
You got a hell of a monarch,

1273
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:17.510
but a,
your soccer team was going to lose tomorrow.
I'm calling it right now.

1274
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:22.040
We're going to get to the round of eight and it's gonna take me at least three

1275
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:25.670
days to get that information that it actually happened.
All right,
that's it.

1276
01:18:25.671 --> 01:18:27.770
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.
