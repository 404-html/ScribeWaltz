1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.853
Huh?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.010
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.</v>

3
00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:08.510
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
August 1st,

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.640
uh,
2016.
How the hell are you?
How high is she going?

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:18.530
Hey G,
did he fight?
Hinge all trash.
80.
I'm in Dublin,
Dublin,

6
00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:22.370
Ireland and uh,
I had my first couple of shows,

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.620
um,
last night and I was working,

8
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.710
believe it or not,
I was working outside in a fucking tent.

9
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.220
I don't have any of my podcast shit,
by the way,
if the sound is bad,
um,

10
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:38.660
I apologize.
I just,

11
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.400
the little mix of that I use every time I come over here,

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.640
even though I use the adapters and all that,
when I plug it in,

13
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.380
it just blows up my fucking thing.

14
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:53.030
Every time I've lost like two or three mixers doing that.
And then I got smart.

15
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.380
So now I just use this little portable fucking thing.
But anyways,
I um,
oh,

16
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.810
how the fuck is my password?

17
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.940
<v 0>Come on</v>

18
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.660
<v 1>bill.
You can do with a,
we go,
there we go.
Ah,</v>

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.540
Jesus.
I just fucked it up.
I'll fuck you.
I hate computers.
I fucking these,

20
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.700
this data still make you fucking life easier today.

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.830
You know what makes it easier where you're just like,
oh,

22
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:19.640
what kind of a fucking turtle is that?
You know,
that's where the good,

23
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.380
I can't,
I literally can't talk and do my password at the same time.

24
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.440
<v 0>Yeah.
Fuck it.</v>

25
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.040
Fuck I gotta hit pause.

26
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.490
<v 1>All right,
I'm back.
I got it.
Anyways.
Um,</v>

27
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:40.780
so I performed in a tent and an air condition tent.

28
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.050
I flew halfway around the fucking world to perform outside in a tent.

29
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.730
So technically I was back inside that was not air conditioned.

30
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.370
It was fucking hot,
as hot as hell.

31
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.450
And my first show was like at four o'clock in the afternoon,

32
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.350
one of this,
this stranger's gigs.
It was still a great Gig,

33
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:05.140
but it was fucking bizarre.
And um,

34
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.220
I told them to close the door to the tent.

35
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.130
It was sort of like a structure,
you know,

36
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.950
one of those ones that you just put up and then they take it down and you're

37
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:18.130
like,
Hey,
wait,
you know,
like what the fuck that thing come from?

38
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.260
And then where the fuck did that thing go?
One of those,
you know,

39
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.790
Home Depot special.

40
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:25.630
So I told him to close the door because it was still broad daylight out,

41
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.310
you know,
and just comedy is like,
you know,
it's a fucking,
it's a nighttime,

42
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.950
dirty,
sleazy thing.
So I had them close the door and then like an asshole,

43
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.510
I'm bitching and go,
what the fuck is it?
So hot in here?

44
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.070
They had to give me like this giant like beach towel to wipe my fucking bald

45
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:46.330
head.
Oh fuck.

46
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.890
Um,
but I had a great time and um,

47
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.960
you know,
and I am not jet lagged,
it all.
Um,

48
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.880
I want to thank this,
uh,
well I don't get anybody in trouble,

49
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.390
but this person hooked me up with,
uh,

50
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.970
these little fucking things at Jamieson,
right?

51
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.530
Like these little bottles and uh,
you know,
I was going to be a good boy,
right?

52
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:14.800
So I fucking landed in Ireland.
Let me take you through the whole thing.

53
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:19.480
I fucking get on the flight,
right?
Air and English,

54
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.110
right.
Take off her day.
They are right.

55
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.450
And I get there and um,

56
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.300
blew all my money on a first class fucking ticket cause I'm not,

57
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.050
I'm not sitting in the back of the plane.
I'm an old man.
My back is fucked up.

58
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:36.160
So I just said fuck it.

59
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.190
I'm going to throw like 10 gigs out the window and plane tickets.
This was,

60
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.120
that's what I'm going to do.
It gives a shit.
Right.
So,
uh,

61
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.860
I show up.

62
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.360
It's one of those fucking folds all the way down into a bed seats.

63
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.680
So I am site right then there's fucking asshole.

64
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.630
I mean,
how can it can only go up from there,
right?
Oh,
I guess.

65
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.170
I guess it can go down.
It's,
I'm just saying it's like a perfect situation.
Oh,

66
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.310
hang on my fucking exit here.
All right,
I'm back.
You know what?

67
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:11.080
This is going to be breakfast with Billy.
Oh,
Billy.
Breakfast face.

68
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.660
Um,
so anyways,
I get on this fucking plane,
uh,

69
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.750
and I'm laying in a goddamn bed and they got Goodfellas.

70
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.610
Goodfellas is one of the movies that I can watch.
I'm like,
this is,

71
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.210
this is fucking perfect.
Nothing can ruin this.

72
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.080
And then this fucking cunt in front of me,

73
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.930
he's listening to his Bose headset.

74
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.360
So he's basically shut out the entire fucking world and he's listening to music

75
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.200
and he's humming along with it,
like in a tone deaf way.

76
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.720
So like he'd go like,
hmm.
And when like the music would go up,
like higher notes,

77
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.710
he wouldn't harm higher.
He just get louder.
It was just so,

78
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.750
<v 2>ah,</v>

79
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.580
<v 1>I'm sitting there going,</v>

80
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.610
how the fuck do I tell this guy politely to stop fucking Humvee?

81
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.150
I literally had I put earplugs in,
I could still hear the guy.
And I'm like,

82
00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:15.710
why the fuck didn't I bought by the Bose headset to shut this fucking guy out?

83
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:16.544
Right.

84
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.010
So fortunately they started up the jet engines and I swear to God,

85
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:25.520
I could still fucking here this guy.
And uh,
then I,
I just,

86
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.650
I put on the movie and then I was fine.
So anyways,

87
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.770
so I started to watch Goodfellas,
you know,

88
00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:35.660
my flight was like eight o'clock at night.
I start watching it and,
um,
I ended up,

89
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.400
I,
you know,
I hit pause cause I'm going to go to sleep.

90
00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:41.960
I just fucking fall asleep.
Right.
And then I wake up with like,
we have like,

91
00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:45.110
it's like a 10 hour flight.
I sleep for like eight hours.

92
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.700
I had already been on a plane for like an hour and a half.

93
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:49.370
We like 30 minutes left.
I watched a little more good fellas.

94
00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:53.240
And then we landed to,
now it's like two o'clock in the afternoon.

95
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.950
I'm fucking wide awake.

96
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.700
I'm wide awake and all I'm thinking is just like,

97
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.660
I hate this now I'm going to be jet lagged,
I'm going to be up all night.
And uh,

98
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.860
I didn't have a show here in Dublin.
So what I did was,
um,

99
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.730
somebody who hooked me up and I want to say thank you to the person that gave me

100
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:12.410
these little Jamieson bottles,
right?

101
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.650
The 12 year fucking things and I wasn't going to drink or anything like that,

102
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.940
but it got to be like 11 o'clock at night and I'm like,
I am fucking wide awake.

103
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.570
This is going to suck.
I got to get on fucking Ireland time.

104
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.410
And I just came up with this idea.
It's like,
well,
you know,

105
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:30.440
if I drink in the afternoon,
I pass out and go to sleep.

106
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.300
So why don't I just start drinking?

107
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.750
So I'm alone in my hotel room and I just fucking pound these four bottles,

108
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:42.530
little bottles of the James Right now.
I'm nice and buzzed.

109
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.190
I start reading a book and write big Fridays.
I start getting sleepy.

110
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:48.980
I opened the curtains,
you know,

111
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.280
so the light would come in and spill in at like seven in the morning.

112
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:54.860
So I ended up falling asleep like around two,

113
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:58.880
three o'clock in the morning and then I was up at 7:00 AM

114
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.260
<v 3>okay.</v>

115
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.790
<v 1>Does,
you know,
hung over or whatever.
That part sucked,
but it only took me a day.</v>

116
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.040
Now I'm totally fucking acclimated.
Last night,

117
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.690
by the time I was done with my second show,
I was like totally fucking sleepy.

118
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.230
I was ready to pass out,
but I ran into Joe to Rosa and he's a drunk like me.

119
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.710
So we ended up going out.
I'll tell you the story in a second.

120
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:23.310
I gotta get these fucking ex,
hang on.
Alright,
I'm back.
Sorry about that.

121
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.800
I need to fucking ex.
Um,
you know,

122
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:32.801
one thing I don't like about leaving the United States of America is the United

123
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.800
States of America,
the greatest country

124
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.390
on the planet as far as I'm concerned.

125
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.770
I just like saying that because people around the world get annoyed and like

126
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:50.360
part of them,
they know it's true.
You know?
It's true.
You know what I mean?

127
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.810
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.320
<v 1>And only got going a couple hundred years ago,
but we caught up to alia,</v>

129
00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.180
we went right pasture and all you guys here with your history and your fucking

130
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:02.550
castles in your great walls,
you know,

131
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.440
none of that can compare to our strip malls.
You know,
it's true.

132
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.550
I know it's true.
Um,

133
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.740
I fucking hate bacon around the world.

134
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.780
The Best Bacon in the world is in the United States of America.
That is bacon.

135
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.640
This Canadian Bacon,
these slabs of fucking ham.
It's not bacon.

136
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.200
It's not bacon.

137
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.440
Or is this another one of those football fucking soccer arguments.

138
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.380
Maybe we're wrong.
Maybe we should not call it fucking bacon.

139
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.520
I don't know what it is.
But whatever we have in the United States,

140
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.650
it's fucking delicious.

141
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.240
And for whatever reason it's not served anywhere else in the world.

142
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.680
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

143
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.430
<v 1>I don't know what you guys call it.
Is there something else?</v>

144
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.790
Whatever the American style bacon is.
Do you call it something else?

145
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.700
And he's fucking God forsaken countries that,
Geez,
I got the hiccups.

146
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.910
I ate too fast.
They can't have,

147
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.090
you can't do a podcast while eating fucking eggs.

148
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.130
All right now hang on a second.
I got to go scare my scare myself.
Hang on.

149
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.760
It's only foster Brooks.
Yeah.
So if anybody,

150
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:14.600
anybody out,
they can tell me,
uh,

151
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.220
this podcast is going to be so fucked up cause I keep time traveling.

152
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.960
I just keep hitting pause and then going into the future,
um,

153
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.390
anybody can tell me.
Yeah,
what you call,

154
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.900
can I get that bacon over here and stop getting these slabs of fucking ham?

155
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.210
I don't know.
It's the little things.

156
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:38.960
It's the little things that you miss when you travel.
So anyways,
that's,

157
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:43.700
that's my new way where I'm going to beat jet lag.
That's how you do it.
You know,

158
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.190
instead of sitting there trying to fall asleep,

159
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.980
you just get shit faced and you pass out.
But before you get shit faced,

160
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:54.920
you open the curtains so then the sun will wake you up and it sucks the first

161
00:09:54.921 --> 00:09:57.200
night you just going to feel like,
you know,

162
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.180
I mean I just felt like how I always do,
I woke up,
hung over,
wouldn't,

163
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:05.990
didn't get enough sleep
and then I was just,
I was fucking on it,

164
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.300
you know.
And um,

165
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.750
so I woke up and it was Sunday morning and Dublin and uh,

166
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.540
I decided I was going to walk around and,
um,

167
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.530
which is funny cause my cell phone,
you know,
the whole,
you know,

168
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.460
Google map thing isn't working over here.
So,
uh,
it's,
I just like,

169
00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:29.510
uh,
when I was in,
before I left,
I,
you know,

170
00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:33.770
I was on the hotel Wifi,
so I just,

171
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.080
my Google map thing was working and I just took a screenshot of where I was in

172
00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:42.290
case I got lost and I could just jump in a cab or some shit.
So anyways,

173
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.840
I fucking just start walking around and,
uh,
like nothing is open.

174
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.280
I forgot it was Sunday.
I'm like,
what the fuck?
What's going on?

175
00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:57.020
These people fucking all at home eating breakfast.
None of these places are open.

176
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.990
And I was just walking and walking.
I didn't realize,
you know,

177
00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:03.260
it was like fucking 9:00 AM or some shit like that.
And on a Sunday,

178
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.470
and I already gone downstairs,
I'd already taken a steam.

179
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.120
They got a steam and a fucking pool and it was totally on fucking Dublin time.

180
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.210
And,
uh,
I just walked all around Dublin.

181
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.940
I was like on the other side down,
you know,
with that fucking horrific,
uh,

182
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.880
temple bar is where the fuck they call it.

183
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.390
The temple bar begins with a t that's every fucking jerk off American goes,

184
00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:30.800
Ooh,
you go to Dublin,
you go to go down there.

185
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.820
And I went there the first time I came here and I go down there and I'm like

186
00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:36.950
talking to some guy from Cincinnati.
I'm like,

187
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:41.360
I can fucking do this in the United States.
I don't want to be here.
Um,

188
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.070
everything's fucking overpriced.

189
00:11:43.071 --> 00:11:47.480
So I walked on the other side of the river and I walked all the way up to their

190
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:52.310
park.
Uh,
it was called Phoenix,
the Phoenix Park.
Um,

191
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.190
I walked for three and a half hours.

192
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.413
<v 3>MMM.</v>

193
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.850
<v 1>Just checking out this beautiful city and uh,
their park is fucking amazing.</v>

194
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.381
And uh,

195
00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:09.060
I got about halfway into it and then I realized they had a zoo and a,
I hate,

196
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.270
I fucking hate zoos.
I'm one of those people,
I don't like zoos.

197
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:15.540
I don't like sea world.
It's like,
will you let these things go?

198
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.341
You know what I mean?

199
00:12:17.341 --> 00:12:22.080
Just let them go with the fact that a fucking God damn whale has like a matinee

200
00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:25.080
show.
Like,
like the fact that like how does it kill a whale?

201
00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:27.390
Like end up in show business,
you know what I mean?

202
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.090
And then they go and they kill their fucking trainers and it's just like,
yeah,

203
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.880
it doesn't want to be there.
And I'm like,
well,
you know,

204
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:41.060
we didn't see any erratic behavior and Bubbleq you didn't see any erratic

205
00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:42.830
behavior.
You making the thing,

206
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.880
jump in the air and do somersaults and lay on its side and wave to people.

207
00:12:46.881 --> 00:12:48.350
It doesn't even know what it's doing.

208
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.980
How do you get a fucking whale to do that other than starving it?

209
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.220
Or how do you beat the shit out of a whale?
I don't know what you do.

210
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.590
What do you electrocute him in the water?

211
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.680
Drop a fucking radio in there every time.
He doesn't go through the hoop.

212
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.120
<v 3>Okay.</v>

213
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.630
<v 1>You know how many fucking trainers have to get attacked and killed before we</v>

214
00:13:05.631 --> 00:13:08.360
understand that these fucking people don't want to do it.

215
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.673
<v 3>You know,</v>

216
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:17.230
<v 1>has the dancing clown like me ever attacked or murdered his fucking agent?</v>

217
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.000
No,
because we want to,
cause it's,
we,

218
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.390
it was their own fucking choice to get into show business,

219
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:26.350
to make a fucking killer whale and a dolphin and,
and uh,

220
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.620
there was a little fucking sea lion thinks and if you all look,

221
00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:33.170
he's waving at us.
No,
he isn't.

222
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.530
They don't understand the concept of way.
I mean,

223
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.950
they're doing the motion of waving.
They're doing that,

224
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.910
but that's so they'll still get food and not get the shit kicked out of them.

225
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.860
Especially like lions and tigers,
like how to fuck you get those giant,

226
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.420
how dumb are those cats?
You know what I mean?
That they just,

227
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:54.950
every fucking night they should just,

228
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.270
they should have to get a new trainer every night.
Like that should be the show.

229
00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.670
Like the train,
it goes,
Yay,
get up on the box.

230
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.590
They just gets mauled and let's sit.

231
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.850
And then they just drag them out and bring another guy in.

232
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:13.510
This little fancy fucking sat and close lion tamer going in there with your

233
00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:15.350
weapon,
your chair.

234
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.240
I never realized how fucking stupid that is.
I'm a lion tamer.

235
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.680
I'm gonna make that Lion Tamer.
Like fucking how insecure are you?

236
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

237
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.370
<v 1>Human beings have the fucking worse.
What does it bother you that,
that,</v>

238
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:34.720
that it's a wild animal.

239
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

240
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.800
<v 1>What makes it an animal?
Wild.</v>

241
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

242
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.020
<v 1>What really makes an animal wild?</v>

243
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.760
The fact that it doesn't give a shit that you have socks and shoes on,
you know?

244
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.940
Is that what makes it wild?
That you know when you'd said,
well,
Hey,

245
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:51.650
get over there and set out.
It's like,
yeah,
go fuck yourself.

246
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:53.443
<v 3>You know</v>

247
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.410
<v 1>the fuck Outta here.
I'll rip your face off.
Like to be,
that's not a wild animal.</v>

248
00:14:59.411 --> 00:15:02.140
That's,
that's an animal that has respect for itself.

249
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.280
Fuck Outta here.
Tell me what it said.
Where the fuck are you?
I'm faster than you.

250
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.820
I'm stronger than you.
I'll fucking kill you.
I won't even eat you.

251
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.480
I'll just fucking angia life.
How about I do that?
How about that?

252
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.020
How about you go over there and sit the fuck down?
You know,

253
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:19.580
I find love wild animals.

254
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.190
I just realize that you've got to respect them.
Ah,
man.

255
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.620
I was watching an awful fucking video.
The other nightmare,

256
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.820
just watching snakes eat other snakes and anything worse than that.

257
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.100
Fucking serpents all wound up around each other.

258
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.580
I fucking hate snakes.

259
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.780
I remember watching the Indiana Jones when I was a kid and I remember when he

260
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:45.420
fucking hated snakes.
I was just like,
I like this.
I relate to this guy.
You know,

261
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.360
he's flying around in planes.

262
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:50.120
He's trying to bang this bride and he doesn't like snakes.

263
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.280
He's got a nice leather jacket,
pulls off a hat.
You know what's not to like.

264
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.910
So anyways,
I'm why I'm watching this fucking video.

265
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.910
I don't get how like,
you know,

266
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.480
one of the snakes is poisonous and he's biting the other one in the back and the

267
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:09.880
thing's just fucking tank in it.
It's like,
what?
Yeah,

268
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.870
you're poison doesn't work on that thing.

269
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

270
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.500
<v 1>Oh,
you're so fucking nervous.
Like nothing's coming out.</v>

271
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.060
That's gotta be the worst.

272
00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:24.240
That's gotta be the worst thing ever as one of the snakes is eating the other

273
00:16:24.241 --> 00:16:25.650
snake.
Right.
And he's,

274
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.400
he's fucking sucking them down and like this snake that's getting eaten,

275
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.150
the part of his body that's not in the other snake is still moving.

276
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.210
It's just going down the tunnel.

277
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.260
I know they're reptiles and they can't think,

278
00:16:40.261 --> 00:16:42.810
but then somewhere on it even admits Reptilian head,

279
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.800
it's gotta be in their life like freaking the fuck out.

280
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:48.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

281
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.600
<v 1>Eaten alive.
It's gotta be the worst.
You know what I mean?
It's like,</v>

282
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.220
I don't mean just like just brighten India.
At least she'd bleed out.

283
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:59.250
But if some just swallows you whole like that.

284
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.983
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

285
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.870
<v 1>Just going down this fucking thing.</v>

286
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.170
At what point do you run out of air?

287
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.940
Why isn't the snake that's going into the other snake?

288
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.470
That's when he should start biting them.

289
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.600
Fucking eat him from the fucking inside out.

290
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.580
Some reason that doesn't happen.
You know,

291
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.150
that's another problem in this election year.

292
00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.400
Someone's needs to answer that question for me.
Hey,

293
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:29.210
you know what I'm really getting fucking tired of is the funniest fucking thing

294
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:31.490
ever to me.
And I'm not going to name any names.

295
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.940
I love when celebrities tell me who to vote for.

296
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:40.130
That's the stupidest fucking thing ever.
Uh,
you know,

297
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:43.760
I don't know if I should vote for Trump or for Hillary.

298
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.470
I can't make up my mind.
Oh,
wait a minute.
It's the guy from the dog whisperer.

299
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.650
Maybe he should tell him.
Oh yeah.
Who should I elect for?

300
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:54.060
Leader of the free world?

301
00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:00.300
I'll tell you what is fucking hilarious to me.
It's not really hilarious,

302
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.460
but I actually,
I think I was,
I just met somebody when I was down in the,
uh,

303
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.500
I've took a steam,
right?

304
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.380
And then I went into the pool and I was shooting the shit with this guy.

305
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.470
And I'm telling you,
I think Trump could win.

306
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.400
I never thought I was just saying,
I go,
this is gonna be a fucking landslide.

307
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.830
No one's going to vote for this fucking dope.
Right?

308
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.370
And I'm running into this guy just got in these,
just sitting there going,
hey,

309
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:27.150
I can't fucking,
he's going,
I can't vote for Hillary.
She's a fucking criminal.

310
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:31.020
I'm going,
yeah,
but this other guy,
this guy's a dope.
Cause I agree with you.

311
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.690
The Hillary is a fucking idiot.
No,
I mean a criminal.

312
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:36.630
But this guy's like a fucking dope.
And he's got a,
you know,

313
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:40.920
but I think he just needs to shut up.
And I think he can get stuff done.

314
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:45.390
And this is,
this is the thing,
the human being in me.
All right,

315
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.250
the fucking,
I don't want to see Trump win.
Okay.

316
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.340
But I gotta tell you something.
Just living in Hollywood,

317
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.800
how fucking terrified they are that he's going to win.
It's worth it.

318
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.640
I just want to watch everybody just fucking freaking out.

319
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.560
It's going to be the like personal own selfish reasons.
If Trump gets elected,

320
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.930
like there's no place in the world,

321
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:14.931
you're going to want to be the next day then right in Hollywood in La and just

322
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:18.960
listen,
listen to them fucking losing their mind.

323
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.210
They literally think that that guy is going to take the entire country down.

324
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.850
Like it's possible for either Hillary

325
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.890
or Trump to do it.
You can't do it.
Fortunately,
the way our whole thing set up,

326
00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:36.300
like,
you know,
if he'd get a couple of things done I guess is president,

327
00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:40.620
it's a great thing.
But um,
if he had to bet right now,

328
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.830
like this would be such as like if this was a Superbowl,

329
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:45.170
<v 0>yeah.</v>

330
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.360
<v 1>Um,
this is the hardest fucking,</v>

331
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.370
how do you handicap this one there so fucking polarizing,
right?

332
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.920
You got Hillary Clinton,
right?
Like,

333
00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.970
like I,
I really feel like people in this country are,
are like,

334
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.630
maybe like,
I don't Clinton's and bushes.
I'm just sick of him.

335
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.040
I'm fucking sick of them,
right.

336
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:12.460
But I think there's enough people that fucking hate Hillary because they hate

337
00:20:12.741 --> 00:20:16.670
Bill Clinton.
And then you got to also sexist people who just won't

338
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.250
vote for a woman.

339
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.660
And then you got women who will vote for just because she's a woman.

340
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.290
So maybe they'll cancel each other out.
And then he got Trump.

341
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.010
Who you know,
I want to say as a fucking dope,

342
00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:33.800
but I mean the guy is a fucking billionaire,
right?
Is he though?

343
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.920
I don't know if he is.
Who the fuck he says he is?
I have no fucking idea.

344
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.490
Granted he did inherit the money,
but he also didn't fuck it up.

345
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.090
But he did go bankrupt.
I can't figure this fucking guy out.

346
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.350
I just can't believe these are my two choices.
I can't fucking believe it.

347
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.300
These,
this,
this,
this is all time.
Fucking worst.

348
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.540
Worst fucking election ever.

349
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.810
How the fuck did we end up with these ds two fucking people?

350
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.340
You know what?
Maybe I will listen to the dog whisperer guy.
Maybe.

351
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.820
Maybe they can help me out.
I don't know what to do.

352
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.440
I don't have no fucking idea what to do.

353
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.450
There's no fucking way I'm voting for Trump,

354
00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:17.270
but I'm not voting for somebody with 15 felony counts either.

355
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.240
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

356
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.570
You know what's hilarious over here is fucking people like,

357
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.083
<v 0>yeah,</v>

358
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.540
<v 1>people are freaking out about Trump over here.
They're like,
dude,</v>

359
00:21:33.541 --> 00:21:34.650
you can't fucking elect that.

360
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:37.790
You cannot have that guy be the leader of the free world.
And I'm like,
as when,

361
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.760
then what?
We're supposed to have the convicted felon.
I don't,

362
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.600
it's a fucking shit show people.
So anyways,

363
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.580
I dunno what the fuck they want.
You know,

364
00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:52.980
it's fucking hilarious about me talking about all of this shit.

365
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.100
I have not watched one fucking,

366
00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.040
I watched the first republican debate back when Trump was funny.

367
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.030
When you just like,
and this is hilarious at this,

368
00:22:05.031 --> 00:22:08.610
this guy's running for president.
This is funny.
It's like if you,
you,

369
00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.980
you fucking buddies like,
Hey,
I'll run for mayor.

370
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.860
And all of a sudden you see him on TV,
he's just laughing.

371
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.620
Watching him sounded like a fucking idiot,
you know,
and then,
then it's over.

372
00:22:17.621 --> 00:22:19.620
And then you go back to the real world.
That back when he,

373
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.980
that's when I watched and then he kept winning and that was just,

374
00:22:22.981 --> 00:22:24.420
it just stopped being funny to me.

375
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.480
So I stopped watching and I cannot listen to Hillary's fucking voice.

376
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.980
Oh my God.

377
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

378
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.480
<v 1>Oh my God.
Like all,
it's,
it's,
it's,</v>

379
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.030
it's uh,
I dunno,
I have no fucking idea.

380
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:46.210
You know what's funny is they give a shit more of a here about the election than

381
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:49.720
we do,
you know?
Do you know,

382
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.560
like when those fucking banker cons,
um,

383
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.060
those banker comes fucking,
uh,

384
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.490
in America when they totally cooked the fucking economy.

385
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.090
Like then,
cause everybody's like all tied in with each other.

386
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:10.300
Like that really affected the economy over here in Ireland.

387
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.690
I had no fucking idea.
I had no idea that that happened.

388
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.230
And like people over here got so despondent that the suicide rate went up and

389
00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:20.320
everything like that.
And it just kills me because you know,

390
00:23:20.321 --> 00:23:24.190
those bankers don't give a fuck.
They still sleep at night,
sleep soundly.

391
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.060
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

392
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.840
<v 1>I'm telling you that is,
that is the candidate that I'm waiting for,</v>

393
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.730
not the one that is going to say,
hey,
you know,
we need to fucking,

394
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.960
we need all kinds of reform and regulations in banking.

395
00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:40.330
I don't want to hear that guy.
What we're beyond that.
I want to,

396
00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.420
I want the guy that's going to be like,
look,

397
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.230
we need to kill a bunch of bankers.
Fucking start all over again.
That's,

398
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.050
that's my guy,
right?
I don't want,
I'm talking about,
let,

399
00:23:52.051 --> 00:23:56.510
let me do a couple of live reads here.
All right.
I hope the sound is okay here.

400
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.900
23 fuck and minutes and,
all right.
Um,

401
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.050
frame.
Bridge.
All right.

402
00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:07.070
You got an empty walls and you got something special you want to frame,

403
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.820
but she'd never do it because it takes too long and it costs too much money.

404
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.580
It's a fucking pain in the ass.
I hate doing that shit.

405
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.150
How much shit you got laying around going,
oh,
I'm going to get this frame.

406
00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:18.410
What are you days?
I'm going to get it framed.

407
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:20.210
And you leave it there and then somebody steps on it.

408
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:24.430
Your dog takes a piss on it and then you just end up throwing it up.
You know,

409
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.060
and you want it.
They'll get it.
Frank,
look.

449
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.270
Oh yeah.
All right.
Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats.
Um,

450
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.490
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear,

451
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.650
but instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

452
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.850
clothes,
you on your underwear,

453
00:27:13.851 --> 00:27:17.580
it's probably just boring and beyond is here to change that with exciting new

454
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:18.540
fucking underwear.

455
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:24.290
Every pair of me undies has made from sustainable source modal modal of fabric

456
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:26.160
that's twice the softest cotton.

457
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.310
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies yet.

458
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.520
For some reason they're going to try to do it with this copy.

459
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:36.150
But once you try them on and you'll understand why they're called the world's

460
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:38.270
most comfortable underwear.
And if you,

461
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.280
that's who calls them the world's most comfortable underwear.
You guys,

462
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:46.200
that's like Detroit calling themselves hockey town.
What?
Because you say so.

463
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:52.470
The trade is not hockey town.
Okay.
It's a fucking bombed out God damn city.

464
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.780
Nothing about that city says hockey.

465
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.080
I'm sure when you get out to the outside areas they got a couple of ranks.

466
00:27:58.081 --> 00:28:01.530
But when you're down there,
which you're really thinking is,
I don't want to die.

467
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.330
Um,
if you don't love your first pair of me undies,
they're free.

468
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.480
No questions asked me.

469
00:28:06.481 --> 00:28:09.720
And he says dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a

470
00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:13.740

whether anyone sees them or not.

28.
I got to go meet to Rosa.
He's over here.

478
00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:44.280
Joey opened up for me.
Um,
all right,

479
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.430
three.
I got questions here to do.
All right,

480
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:50.940
let me run my mouth for like another fucking couple of minutes and then I'm

481
00:28:50.941 --> 00:28:54.410
going to go meet up with old Joey.
Droz.
Um,

482
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.640
does Shelly,
she,
somebody gave me a fucking shall Eylea up to the show.

483
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.650
I never knew what it Shalala was.

484
00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:05.130
For some reason I thought it was some sort of like fucking,
you know,

485
00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:08.610
four leaf clover Leprechaun Shit.
Um,

486
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.620
evidently it isn't,
hang on a second.
You know what I'm going to tell Joe Rose,

487
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:16.680
I can't fucking meet him cause I gotta I gotta I gotta finish this podcast and

488
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:21.120
I'm going up to Belfast.
Hang on.
All right.
Just like dead,

489
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.950
just like dad,
I'm back more time travel here.
I'm not going to fucking,

490
00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:29.500
I'm not hanging out with the Rosa trying to catch up with him tonight.
Um,

491
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.260
I'm going up to Belfast.
I've never been there.
And uh,

492
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.870
you know,
when I was growing up,

493
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:39.840
like all you heard all fucking crazy shit that was going on up there.

494
00:29:39.841 --> 00:29:44.080
So my idea of is still a place that you,
uh,

495
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.950
you want to be on your best behavior.
I would think in general,
when you travel,

496
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:51.430
you're representing a country,
you want to be on your best behavior.

497
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:52.540
But when I was growing up,

498
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.900
all the violence and all the craziness and all that shit that I used to always

499
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:59.680
hear about,
um,
up in Belfast and everything.
And uh,

500
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.330
I dunno,

501
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.990
they were talking about Brexit or whatever the fuck are they talking about.
Um,

502
00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:11.500
the UK leaving the European Union for whatever reason,

503
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:16.090
then that might become a hard border again and that could like raise tension and

504
00:30:16.091 --> 00:30:20.230
all that shit.
It's just like fucking human beings,
man.
We just cannot get along.

505
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.050
I just want to go in there.
I want to have a great show.

506
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.220
And then I'm coming back down here to Dublin tonight.
Um,

507
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.950
and then I got Gallway the next day.

508
00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:32.230
Everybody's telling me that's the most beautiful fucking city,

509
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.770
one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
And uh,

510
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:41.500
then I'm off to England.
Oh,
this fucking cunt man.
When I,
when I landed,

511
00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:46.480
they gave me these,
these,
these work papers.
So when you land,
you know,

512
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:52.090
show this to customs,
do not say you're just over there to be a tourist,
right?

513
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.320
Just fucking given the work papers.
So I said,
fine,
right?

514
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.490
And I land and I've fucking Ireland.
I give it to the guy and the guy goes,

515
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:03.820
what sis?
And I said,
oh,
they told me to show,
show you my work papers.

516
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:05.890
I'm working over here,
I'm doing some standup shows.

517
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.760
And the guy goes to says a UK,

518
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.360
Ireland is not part of the UK.
I just want to be like,

519
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:17.800
I know that she a fucking con.
My person told me to show it to you,

520
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.430
but you can't say that because then they'll send you back to the United States.

521
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:22.264
I it'd be like,
oh,

522
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.750
<v 4>oh,
okay.
I didn't realize that.
Oh,
I didn't,
I didn't know what to fucking UK was.</v>

523
00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:33.610
<v 1>She's fucking Christ.
What is the UK?
It's a fight.</v>

524
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:38.100
It's,
it's Northern Ireland,
England,
Wales and fucking,
uh,

525
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.140
Scotland,
right?
Isn't that what the fuck it is?
I gotta look it up now.

526
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.900
Here I am calling this guy.
Can't I actually,
I might get this wrong.

527
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.910
United Kingdom.

528
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.830
It's kind of a big fucking word for fuck's a small area,
you know?

529
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.770
And they get used to be,
they need to do with just that,
you know,

530
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.170
like the way Jefferson airplane did,

531
00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:01.590
then they became Jefferson star ship because it was more into the future.
Right.

532
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.070
All right.
Hang on a sec.
They,
they need to dial this down.
United Kingdom.

533
00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:08.410
When he had all this shit around the world,
then it should have been United.

534
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.580
<v 0>Uh,
no.</v>

535
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.280
<v 1>I don't know what the fuck you'd call it.</v>

536
00:32:13.281 --> 00:32:14.680
And maybe that's why they didn't necessarily know about,

537
00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.520
<v 0>wait a,</v>

538
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.710
<v 1>come back down.
Sorry.
I'm trying to fucking read this shit.
What is it?
Population?</v>

539
00:32:21.711 --> 00:32:25.700
Nobody cares.
Nobody cares.
Okay.
Northern Ireland.

540
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.410
Okay,
great.
Okay.
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,

541
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.090
commonly known as the United Kingdom.

542
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.870
How come he don't fucking talk about Scotland?
Like it's its own deal.

543
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.693
I don't get it.

544
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

545
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.940
<v 1>I always thought like they were subjects.</v>

546
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

547
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.990
<v 1>Of fucking like Britain went up and took them over,</v>

548
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.770
but they still were kind of their own deal.
Is it in Scotland,

549
00:32:50.771 --> 00:32:53.800
Scotland and then fucking England's England.

550
00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:55.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

551
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.540
<v 1>The different people that different nationalities,</v>

552
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.340
they don't fucking like each other.

553
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.613
<v 0>Right</v>

554
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.840
<v 1>then.
Not English,
this Scottish.</v>

555
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.680
Why do they just get all swallowed up by this shit?
I don't understand it.

556
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.950
They don't even bring them up.
They talk about Northern Ireland.

557
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.110
They don't even mention Scottish people.

558
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.750
You know what I,
this guy was right to yell at.
Now you know what,

559
00:33:21.751 --> 00:33:26.010
I take that back.
That guy was not a con,
that fucking,
it was a good con.

560
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.210
He was a top con.
He fucking hit the nail on the head.
That's exactly what he did.

561
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.990
Um,
so anyways,
so I walked all around Dublin.

562
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.040
I'm sorry about this podcast.
It means it's all over the place.

563
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:41.370
Who the fuck's Kyp know?
Um,
so I walked all around Dublin and saw all this,

564
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.910
you know,
I'll,
I'll this shape,
right?
And uh,

565
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.300
and then when I get back,
you know,

566
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.570
the Formula One race comes on at one o'clock in the afternoon out here as

567
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:54.510
opposed to four 30 in the fucking morning.
You know,

568
00:33:54.511 --> 00:33:58.770
I got to record it and then try not to go online and see anything,
you know?
And,

569
00:33:58.771 --> 00:34:01.650
um,
so now I would come back and now I'm starting up.

570
00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.050
The jet lag is getting to me.
I'm starting to feel sleepy and everything.
And,
um,

571
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:12.190
I fucking a,
I,
I took an hour nap.

572
00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.240
I did take an hour nap before my shows,
but a,
so I was listening to the,
Oh,

573
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.940
I watched some of the Formula One and then I fell asleep.

574
00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.580
And anytime anybody went to pass anybody,

575
00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:23.800
the guy would start screaming and then I would wake up.

576
00:34:23.801 --> 00:34:27.280
So I did see most of the exciting parts of the fucking race.

577
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.843
<v 0>MMM.</v>

578
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.500
<v 1>Fucking Nico.
Jesus Christ,
he fight,
he keeps getting the pole position.</v>

579
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.810
He fucks it up in the first turn.
And it's nothing to,
I don't get like,

580
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.160
it just seems like

581
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.120
Formula One racing as far as what I've watched.

582
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.910
The race is just to the first turn.

583
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:53.170
Whoever comes out in front of that turn wins the fucking race it seems.

584
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:58.630
Or at least if Lewis Hamilton gets to the fucking first turn,

585
00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.390
he comes out of there in first place.
It's over.

586
00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.010
He just cruises for the entire fucking,
uh,
the entire race.

587
00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.430
A Nico,
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck was he doing?

588
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.630
Spinning the tires and all his shit and everybody just fucking went right around

589
00:35:16.631 --> 00:35:17.464
them.

590
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:18.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

591
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.390
<v 1>And he's got to spend how he's got to spend the whole fucking race just trying</v>

592
00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:24.270
to get back into second place.
And he did what he always does.

593
00:35:24.271 --> 00:35:26.100
He goes fucking went into a corner,

594
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:30.510
tries to pass on the inside and he just forces the guy to the outside.

595
00:35:30.511 --> 00:35:31.830
Then he gets a fuckup penalty,

596
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.830
but somebody did it to him a few fucking races ago.

597
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.120
There's something about this kid they don't like.
They don't like it.

598
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.900
You fucked him over.
So he wasn't even on the pole,
that podium.
So now,
uh,

599
00:35:42.901 --> 00:35:47.760
Lewis Hamilton,
it's like a head by like 40 points.
I don't know.

600
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.390
Still.
It's a great fucking,
I was actually thinking,
you know,

601
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:54.800
because Germany is only a couple hours away that what I should it now.

602
00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.970
I had an afternoon show.
I still couldn't have done it.

603
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.150
I was thinking like I should have just flown directly to Germany,

604
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:03.910
gone to that thing,
right.
Then jumped on a plane,

605
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.060
come back here and done my Sha.
What if my James Bond,
I couldn't pull that off.

606
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.180
You need your own fucking plane to do that.
Like all those people in the stance,

607
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.520
Formula One,
those people are filthy fucking rich.
It's actually not true.

608
00:36:17.521 --> 00:36:20.760
Actually looked up at for tickets.
You can get a ticket for like 55 bucks.

609
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.290
You get your face pressed up against the screen and if anybody crashes,

610
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:29.970
you're going to die.
But you're going to be there.

611
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.200
You're going to be there for 55 bucks.
You can make it happen.
All right,

612
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:38.250
I'm sorry.
Let's,
let's get to some of the questions here for the week.
Oh,

613
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:43.130
by the way,
I walked through the creepiest God damn park.
Um,

614
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.980
the fuck am I Marion Park or some shit?
You know,

615
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.800
it's beautiful when there's people there,
but I got up at seven in the morning.

616
00:36:49.801 --> 00:36:54.660
There was like nobody there and uh,
I don't know what it was.

617
00:36:54.661 --> 00:36:59.370
It just had it just ate the fucking park,
creep me out.
And,

618
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.770
uh,
some Weirdo guy sitting there

619
00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.090
and then they had this really weird statue of this guy.

620
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:11.880
This self satisfied can't just sitting on a fucking rock.
You know,

621
00:37:11.881 --> 00:37:14.280
I took a picture of it.
Hang on a second.

622
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.270
<v 3>Okay.</v>

623
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.080
<v 1>Right.
Why don't know why the fuck would I shut my phone off?
Oh,
I didn't.</v>

624
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:20.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

625
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.580
<v 1>I just took a screenshot.
All right.
Hang on a second.</v>

626
00:37:24.581 --> 00:37:25.810
What is this guy's name?

627
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.220
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

628
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.400
<v 1>What is his name?
Oh,</v>

629
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:34.000
Ireland's yet another fucking place.
You know where I can buy a Cuban cigar lit.

630
00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:38.310
There's no place to smoke the fucking thing.
Oh,
you can walk down the street,

631
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.230
walk down this,
I'm not a fucking animal.

632
00:37:41.231 --> 00:37:45.640
I'm smoking a cigar like those fucking cigarette smokers,
you know,

633
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:51.310
standing next to a dumpster there.
Animal cigarette smokers are fucking animals.

634
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.890
They really are.
All right.
Yeah,

635
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:59.880
it was Marine Square Park.
All right.

636
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.770
And then I took a picture of a,
they have the blue tit and the green tit bird.

637
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.030
I swear to God there this day or this whole fucking thing on all the different

638
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:12.600
birds.
They tried to claim that there was a fox in there and all this shit,

639
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.330
you know,
and you show up,
you don't see anything.

640
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:18.180
You see that black and white bird,
that's all you see.
Oh there he is.

641
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:20.670
<v 3>Okay.</v>

642
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.140
<v 1>You got a,
you know what?
I'm going to post this picture.
This guy is,</v>

643
00:38:23.141 --> 00:38:26.700
it's got to the,
I don't know if the person didn't like this guy.

644
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.510
Is it Oliver Wilde?

645
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:36.310
I have no idea who he is easier at another one of these fucking clever Irish

646
00:38:36.311 --> 00:38:39.660
cunt fucking writers.
You know what I mean?
Where they're like,
you know,
I ah,

647
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.310
these fucking overdramatic quotes.

648
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.090
I was reading one where the guy said,
uh,

649
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.000
centered.
If he could go back and be young again,

650
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.320
you know,
he wouldn't do it cause he's,

651
00:38:54.321 --> 00:38:57.410
he's so fucking cynical or [inaudible] I can't remember what the fuck it was

652
00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.420
like,
oh,
shut the fuck up.
You fucking miserable content.

653
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:05.240
Jesus Christ just staring into the misery.
Can you show me some light?

654
00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.040
I don't understand it.
Oh my God,
you guys got to see this picture.

655
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.890
Um,
I'm definitely fucking post in this thing.

656
00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.293
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

657
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:19.430
<v 1>That guy is the epitome of a cozy smug content,
as they say over here.</v>

658
00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.120
He looks like he's,
I don't even know what he looks like.

659
00:39:26.121 --> 00:39:27.620
He just looks like a,

660
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.650
you ever watch like a movie and there's just the evil guy and when he's on trial

661
00:39:33.651 --> 00:39:36.350
he just has this look on his face.
Like he's going to get away with it.

662
00:39:36.351 --> 00:39:37.340
That's what he looks like.

663
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.150
Like his dad's going to buy him out and he's got this crooked fucking smile.

664
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.450
Dumb ass fucking loafers.
Um,
all right,

665
00:39:45.451 --> 00:39:49.410
let's get to the questions here for the week.
Um,
all right.
Oh,
Jesus.

666
00:39:49.411 --> 00:39:51.540
He's a big question of will I ever get laid.

667
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

668
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.320
<v 1>All right,
dear bill,
I'm currently in an emotional quandary.</v>

669
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.580
I'm 19 and I've never been laid.
That's not bad.

670
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.720
Said I was homeschooled my entire life by strict religious parents.
All right.

671
00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:08.590
That's bad.
Who Shield maiden shielded me from girls?

672
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:13.330
My sister who is 21 years old,
was my only window to the female world.

673
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.350
She would always have female friends around and many of them hit on me.

674
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:22.660
I even made out slash felt up.
One of them.
So you're in the game.

675
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.400
He scored a couple of buckets.
You're on the scorecard.
Uh,
he said,

676
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:31.180
which was my only sexual experience ever.
So although sheltered,

677
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.080
my outlook is bright,
right?
And he says,
wrong.

678
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:40.110
Three years ago I mysteriously developed severe social anxiety to the point I

679
00:40:40.661 --> 00:40:42.580
can barely go to public places.

680
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.140
Around this time my parents kicked my sister out of the house because she left

681
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:50.290
Christianity.
Oh yeah,
that's inevitable.

682
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.090
So she moved in with the friend.
So now not only am I paralyzed with anxiety,

683
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.940
but now the well has dried up since she left.

684
00:40:57.941 --> 00:41:00.880
And I have no female circulating around in my life.

685
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.360
This is how my life has been since 2013 and I don't know how many more years of

686
00:41:07.271 --> 00:41:09.730
it I can take.
I'm not at the point,

687
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:12.920
I'm not at the point where,

688
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.160
<v 3>yeah,</v>

689
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.790
<v 1>I think you meant to say I'm now at the point,
right?
Where,
what do I do?</v>

690
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.850
Um,
I would,

691
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:24.430
I would deal with your social anxiety first.
I mean,

692
00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:26.560
your parents allow you to go outside,
right?

693
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.810
So what I would do is you just,
you know,

694
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.690
just give yourself some small goals,
you know,

695
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.540
just go out,
go to the store,
go buy something and come home.

696
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:46.040
That's it.
Do that.
He just gradually increase outcome.

697
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.270
It's like flying and you get your pilot's license,

698
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.890
which you do is you just keep gradually increasing this,

699
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.580
the area that you're familiar with and comfortable flying it.
You know,

700
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.460
you don't just get your pilot's license and just fucking,

701
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:06.290
just start flying all over the fucking place.
You're nervous,
you're scared,

702
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:10.970
right?
So you just gradually keep increasing the,
uh,

703
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.430
your area.
So that's what I would do.

704
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.790
And then once you get comfortable with the area,
then,
uh,

705
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:21.440
then you add more shit to it.
There's a woman behind the counter sale,

706
00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:24.650
oto or some shit,
little things,
and dude,
you're gonna be fine.

707
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:29.810
The fact that you're living under those severe conditions and you still made out

708
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:32.540
with a chick and felt her up,
I me,
dude,
you're crushing it.

709
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.050
You're being way too hard on yourself.
You're only 19.

710
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.740
You got your whole life ahead of you,
you know,

711
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:45.590
telling you you're in a great position.
Just,
you know,

712
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.180
just work on it a little bit.
You'll be fine.
You'll totally be fine.

713
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.470
And the fact that you know,

714
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.780
she's bringing these girls over there and they're fucking hitting on you.

715
00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:59.781
I mean the you that never happened to make women now my God,

716
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.190
I had to spin plates and fucking all kinds of shit to try to get them to pay

717
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:05.390
attention to me.
So you're,

718
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.530
you're way better in a way better situation than I was when,
um,
when,
uh,

719
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.570
when I was 19.
So just know that you know,
people always have it worse than you.

720
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:18.710
Just go easy on yourself.
You'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

721
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.310
Probably get laid by the time you fucking 20.

722
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.380
Just go out and say hello to people,
right?
You got women coming over,

723
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:29.120
throwing themselves at you.
I mean,
I don't even know.

724
00:43:29.121 --> 00:43:31.580
Am I supposed to feel bad for you?
I want to be you.

725
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.800
You're 19 and he got women hitting on you.
Dude.
You're a fucking rock star.

726
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.880
All right.
Tired of line.
Hey Billy nut buster.

727
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:46.010
Here's my situation.
I've been mildly depressed.
Jesus Christ.
Here we go.

728
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.210
Everybody seven.
No problem.

729
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:51.140
This week I've been mildly depressed from my whole life and struggled with an

730
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:56.120
identity crisis since my early teens.
What the fuck is an identity crisis?

731
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:59.510
Hang on a second.
What do you look in the mirror and be like,
who the fuck's?
Oh,

732
00:43:59.511 --> 00:44:04.010
that's right.
That's me.
Sorry.
Hold on.
All right.
You know,

733
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:06.770
I just realized how funny this is.
I'm sitting there going like,

734
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:11.450
I hate when like celebrities to try to tell me who I should vote for.

735
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.390
And here I am fucking giving you guys advice,

736
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.050
but don't you guys ask me for advice because you think you know I'm going to say

737
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:22.970
something stupid.
Um,
this is just part of your entertainment,
isn't it?
All right.

738
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.920
Identity crisis.
The term identity crisis coined by the psychologists.

739
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.070
Erick Erickson.
That's a real name.

740
00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.020
My name is Bill Bilson.
This is,
uh,
my buddy here.
Pete Peterson.

741
00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:40.420
Um,
means the failure,

742
00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.650
failure to achieve ego identity during adolescence.

743
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.660
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

744
00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:51.550
<v 1>Well,
what the fuck does that mean you don't achieve ego identity?</v>

745
00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.000
I think that's a definition

746
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.200
that's a fucking enigma wrapped up in a rental,
right?

747
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:08.470
The stage of psychological development in which identity crisis may occur,

748
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.640
and then now you're just going to fucking move on.

749
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.040
None of those fucking words are highlighted.
Am I?

750
00:45:13.041 --> 00:45:15.230
Am I the only dumb ass who doesn't know what that means?

751
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.560
During this stage,
Adam adolescents are faced with physical growth,

752
00:45:21.561 --> 00:45:26.060
sexual maturity in integrating ideas of themselves,

753
00:45:26.061 --> 00:45:29.510
about what others think about themselves.
Oh,
hey,
you are explaining it.
Sorry.

754
00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:34.190
I panicked.
Adolescents therefore form their self image and an ender.

755
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:38.810
The tasks of resolving the crisis of their basic ego identity.

756
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.160
Oh,
so just means you're trying to figure out who you are.

757
00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:43.870
<v 3>Okay,</v>

758
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.610
<v 1>well,
who the fuck knows that at that age?</v>

759
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:48.563
<v 3>All right.</v>

760
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:54.090
<v 1>Let me get back to the fucking question here.
Well,
where's the question?</v>

761
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.950
Did I that I,
I didn't open a new window.
Oh boy.

762
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:04.600
All right,
here we go.
I'm straighten it with the identity crisis.

763
00:46:04.601 --> 00:46:08.830
Since my early teams,
all this,
thanks to my shitty upbringing.

764
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.420
I am Canadian,

765
00:46:10.421 --> 00:46:14.410
but growing up I've always been fascinated with American culture and so on.

766
00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.540
So some Ui and our bacon to our Becky,
you know,
say what you want about,

767
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.350
you know,
our foreign policy,
you can't fuck with our bacon.

768
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:27.130
So some years ago in my late teens,
I'm now 27,

769
00:46:27.131 --> 00:46:30.100
I began to cultivate this lie that I was American.

770
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
I fucking love this guy.
Why would you do that?

771
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.020
This is fascinating.
And so on to the point,

772
00:46:43.021 --> 00:46:46.440
my friends and girlfriends friend believe this,

773
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:50.070
I've gone as far as to legally change my last name,

774
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:54.810
lie about my heritage partly and a few other things.

775
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:59.820
My European girlfriend now believes full heatedly.

776
00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.140
How'd you mean heartedly full heatedly in my life and her family and friends to

777
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.400
it started by accident coming out as the casual lie.

778
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.370
Uh,
it is before we dated.
However,

779
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:15.970
I am now in a very amazing relationship with her and I loved this girl very much

780
00:47:15.971 --> 00:47:17.070
in planning the her.

781
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:22.340
Unfortunately she has trust issues and me being American is part of my appeal.

782
00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:26.910
I'm sure.
Oh God,
dude,
what did you do?

783
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.520
She doesn't take to liars are lying lightly at all.

784
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:33.760
Also we're planning on starting a business together and so on.

785
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.160
This lie would come out eventually.

786
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:41.070
Right now I'm in Canada for a couple of months and she's in Europe.

787
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.150
I'll see her again soon.
And I'd prefer to break the news face to face,

788
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:49.620
not on the phone.
This lie is weighing really heavy on me and I want to tell her,

789
00:47:49.621 --> 00:47:53.220
but I feel that if I lost her,
I couldn't carry on in life.

790
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:57.900
My depression is getting worse with this distance for a few months in the weight

791
00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:01.650
of this lie.
By the way,
this isn't a long distance relationship.

792
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.790
I live over in Europe too.
I want your advice on how to break the news to her.

793
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.750
I love to hear your thoughts on the podcast.
A yeah.
Did you gotta

794
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:16.890
you gotta fucking,
you just got to face the music here.
Um,

795
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:24.120
yeah,
I would just sit her down and just say,
yeah,

796
00:48:24.121 --> 00:48:27.960
listen,
I have something I have to tell you.
Uh Oh God.

797
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.390
And that's gonna make her fucking heart drop.
But you got to do it.

798
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.040
I didn't cheat on you.
I'm not breaking up with you.
I would say that first.

799
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.203
<v 0>Okay.</v>

800
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.830
<v 1>It's a,
you know,
something about me.
I don't have cancer.</v>

801
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:47.900
Uh,
and you just said she'd be like,
what the fuck is it?

802
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:53.720
And you gotta be like,
listen,
um,
I lied about being an American.

803
00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:57.910
There you go.

804
00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.990
And then it's out there and then after that it's going to naturally go its

805
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:06.460
course.
That's all you have to do.
I lied about being American.

806
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:10.840
I lied about being Americans.
Five fucking words,
five fucking words.

807
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:12.970
And this weight is off your chest.

808
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.680
Now how she reacts to it and all of that other stuff is different.

809
00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:20.970
I would just be totally honest with her and just say the weight of this,

810
00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:25.510
the reason why I did it.
I didn't like myself.
The identity crisis.

811
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.280
Just tell her why you did it.

812
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.080
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

813
00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.070
<v 1>And um,</v>

814
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:38.090
then I don't know what you do after that other than just wait to see her

815
00:49:38.491 --> 00:49:39.390
reaction to it.

816
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:42.223
<v 0>MMM.</v>

817
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.780
<v 1>I knew somebody one time that lied about their age</v>

818
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:52.040
and uh,
it was nuts.

819
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:57.130
He was dating this person for a number of years and she was much younger.

820
00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:02.690
So he started out the relationship by saying he was,
he was younger.

821
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.210
And then I remember like when he started introducing her to us,

822
00:50:08.211 --> 00:50:12.770
the few times he did,
he was going like,
listen a be like,

823
00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:13.663
just,

824
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:14.150
<v 0>yeah,</v>

825
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:19.070
<v 1>we went to high school together,
but we didn't graduate in 1987.
We graduate</v>

826
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.050
like 1993.
And we were all sitting there laughing and I'm going like,
dude,

827
00:50:25.051 --> 00:50:29.700
I can't remember all this shit.
How about I just,

828
00:50:29.701 --> 00:50:33.510
I don't bring up high school.
I just won't bring up any years.
And we just,

829
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.180
we basically hammered this guy

830
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.630
forever and then he finally came clean.
And you know what dude?

831
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.660
He came clean and she didn't break up with them.

832
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:45.140
<v 3>Okay.</v>

833
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:50.000
<v 1>She didn't fucking break up with the women are way more forgiving than,</v>

834
00:50:50.001 --> 00:50:55.000
uh,
than men are.
I think they,
their,

835
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.890
their,
their capacity to forgive is much greater.

836
00:50:58.891 --> 00:51:03.300
So what's funny was this guy finally came clean.
She freaked the fuck out.

837
00:51:03.301 --> 00:51:05.520
But then she forgave him and then they stayed together.

838
00:51:05.521 --> 00:51:07.710
And then six months later he dumped her.
So,

839
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:09.200
<v 3>okay,</v>

840
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.110
<v 1>figure that one out.
So dude,
you'll be fine.
Just tell her you got to tell her,</v>

841
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.940
you know,
and um,
no matter what,
dude,

842
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.120
you're going to survive this whole fucking thing of like,
oh my God,

843
00:51:21.121 --> 00:51:24.690
if this person leaves me a,
my life's going to be,
it's not going to be over.
Okay.

844
00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:29.310
And she probably won't leave you.
You know,
she loves you two,
you'll be fine.

845
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.450
But you know,
just

846
00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:31.400
<v 3>okay,</v>

847
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.710
<v 1>the big thing,
all you got to worry about duty,
she just got,</v>

848
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:36.800
you just got to get this fucking lie off your chest and you know what dude?

849
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:42.020
Then you can fucking breathe again and uh,
yeah.

850
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:45.040
Yeah.
That's going to be weird for a while,
but you know,

851
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:49.330
it's a situation you created and as a man,
you got to fucking deal with it.

852
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.100
All right,
so good luck to you.
All right.
My girl wears entirely too much makeup.

853
00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:56.860
Oh,
Billy fire crutch.

854
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:03.370
I've been dating a girl for three years who was fantastic,
fantastic.

855
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.110
She's caring.
She's carrying,
listens to me bitch about work and is

856
00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:08.900
<v 3>okay.</v>

857
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:12.250
<v 1>A crazy lunatic in a good way.
In the SEC.
All right,</v>

858
00:52:12.251 --> 00:52:14.900
so she's great and bed and she puts up with you.
What's,

859
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:19.310
what's the not like my one problem is that she wears way too much makeup.

860
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:24.290
She watches youtube videos all the time dealing with ways to put on makeup,

861
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.930
but she always looks like she uses too much.

862
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.860
Her eyebrows look kind of like Groucho Marx by the end of it.

863
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.460
My dilemma is how do I go about telling her nicely that she,

864
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.480
she should ease up on the makeup.
She's very sensitive about our looks.
Yeah,

865
00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:43.370
I would guess that,
but also values my opinion,
which is why I'm in a tough spot.

866
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.440
I kind of feel like a jerk too,

867
00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:50.441
because if this is my one problem than I should be able to deal with it.

868
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:55.850
Right.
Uh,
the lovely Nia should probably weigh in on this.
Uh,
also,

869
00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.630
if she's not asleep,
thanks and go fuck yourself.
Unfortunately she's not here.

870
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.390
Yeah,
I would just,
uh,
I dunno,

871
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.440
one time when she's not wearing makeup,
just tell her how pretty she looks.

872
00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.890
Didn't just tell her that you love the way she looks.

873
00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:13.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

874
00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:14.723
<v 1>You know?</v>

875
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.620
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

876
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.640
<v 1>Just start there.</v>

877
00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:22.720
Gradually build up or fucking confidence and uh,

878
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.890
I dunno how you could ever just say,
you know what,

879
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.810
you wear too much makeup if you just said it just

880
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:30.270
<v 3>okay.</v>

881
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.470
<v 1>I uh,
how,
how would you say,
well,
let's get to the truth of the matter.</v>

882
00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.250
You're obviously attracted to are you obviously think she's beautiful but she

883
00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:41.010
wears soon.
So much makeup.
Yeah.
If a woman wears too much makeup,

884
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:43.560
they can start looking crazy.
Then also,
you know,

885
00:53:43.561 --> 00:53:47.370
they give you a hug and it's just like you have like the imprint of their face,

886
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:49.980
you know what I mean?
Is I call the stigmata.

887
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.130
What's the thing when you have fucking Jesus's face on you at Christ?

888
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:55.710
I always have to look.
I know many times I fucking looked up this word,

889
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:04.330
so fucking great song too.
That's stigma.

890
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.730
Alright.
Stigmata

891
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:08.560
<v 3>okay.</v>

892
00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.790
<v 1>Is a term used?
Oh,</v>

893
00:54:12.791 --> 00:54:14.620
Jesus Christ.
This is all this religious,

894
00:54:14.621 --> 00:54:17.830
it's a term used by members of the Christian faith to describe body marks,

895
00:54:17.831 --> 00:54:22.831
sores or sensations of pain and locations corresponding to the crucifixion

896
00:54:23.051 --> 00:54:26.380
wounds of Jesus Christ,
such as hands,
wrists,
and feet.

897
00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.460
I'll give me a fucking break.
What is,

898
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:34.230
what the fuck is wrong with people?
Oh,

899
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:38.400
Jesus is in me and my hands fucking hurt.
I mean,
can you fucking imagine Lynn?

900
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.860
Let's say,
let's just fucking say,

901
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:44.061
okay.

902
00:54:44.061 --> 00:54:49.061
For the sake of fucking argument that Jesus Christ was a real person and that

903
00:54:49.671 --> 00:54:53.510
shit happened to him.
For you to fucking sit there and be like,

904
00:54:53.511 --> 00:54:57.590
oh my fucking hands hurt.
You know?
Do you realize how insulting that is?

905
00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.220
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

906
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:04.120
<v 1>To,
to,
to fucking Jay star there.
You know this guy had fucking nails.</v>

907
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:05.510
<v 3>Okay.</v>

908
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:09.050
<v 1>Isn't it?
In his arms.
And he did it to his hands.
The weight of his fucking body.</v>

909
00:55:09.051 --> 00:55:10.070
They would have ripped off.

910
00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:15.080
Then they actually do it in the fucking risks between the radius and the Ulna.

911
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.770
The fucking agony that this person went through.

912
00:55:18.771 --> 00:55:21.470
And you're going to fucking sit there.
Oh yeah.
I kind of feel it.
Two,

913
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:26.450
how fucking self centered are you?
Um,
all right,

914
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:31.430
so she wears too much makeup.
Yeah,
I would just say,
uh,
yeah,

915
00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:35.620
I would just tell her how pretty she is,
you know?

916
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

917
00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:40.270
<v 1>And rather than saying you wear too much makeup,
I would more phrase it like,</v>

918
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.040
you know,
you don't have to wear all that makeup.

919
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:43.570
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

920
00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:48.110
<v 1>yeah.
She'd show the world your beautiful face,
you covering it up.
So I would,</v>

921
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:53.090
I would go on a very positive way,
you know,
but I would just,

922
00:55:53.091 --> 00:55:55.640
I would just ease into,
I would just,
when she's not wearing makeup,

923
00:55:55.641 --> 00:56:00.110
you just keep telling her how pretty she looks,
you know what I mean?
Um,

924
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:02.240
<v 3>yeah.</v>

925
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.700
<v 1>And then hopefully she'll get past it because that's a sad thing.</v>

926
00:56:04.701 --> 00:56:09.350
If someone's walking around,
they don't like how they look.
Um,
I don't know.

927
00:56:09.351 --> 00:56:12.110
People are fucking nuts people.

928
00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.670
I think the Internet makes people even more fucking nuts.

929
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:17.220
Just sitting there looking at all these people,

930
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:21.480
at least Instagram people and all this fucking shit.
Just,
it tries people.
Eco,

931
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.320
you get a little crazy.
Um,
all right.
Podcast topics slash hopefully.

932
00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:30.460
Interesting thought.
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
you wrote a God damn novel here.

933
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:35.080
All right,
I'm going to apologize up front for my bad reading here.
Alright,

934
00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:37.470
here we go.
Hey Bill.
Um,

935
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.840
are you up for something a little bit different?
Who writes set?

936
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:48.700
It's not about football and if it's a conspiracy theory,

937
00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.110
it's one for the future.

938
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:54.490
I bet you didn't think making pie would be something interesting to you.

939
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:59.560
But look at you now with the butter crust and everything.
So give it a shot.

940
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:02.650
Ah Ha.
Well Dude,
I'm fucking read it.
You don't,

941
00:57:02.651 --> 00:57:05.770
you don't get to write all that stuff.
I'll read anything.
All right.

942
00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:09.850
Would you ever tell a port somewhere if the technology got to that point?

943
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:15.100
It was something I thought would be cool until you see the difference ways

944
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.960
they're trying it,
trying it out.

945
00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:22.710
Who is the first is a wormhole,

946
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:28.100
which is some kind of space time anomaly that I don't even think the physicist

947
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:32.700
understands.
Okay.
Physicist to understand.
I don't understand what I,

948
00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.000
you've already lost me.
This would be pretty cool,

949
00:57:35.001 --> 00:57:40.001
but it is obviously especially unlikely to ever be a thing.

950
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:46.440
Do,
would you look at this sentence?
This would be pretty cool,

951
00:57:46.441 --> 00:57:50.070
but as obviously a specially unlikely to ever be a thing.

952
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

953
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:54.990
<v 1>It was like fucking left and right.
Turns it in.
Just in that sentence.</v>

954
00:57:54.991 --> 00:57:58.660
Another way they are looking.
Oh by the way,
I,
you know,

955
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:02.890
I never understood why Formula One was looking down on like Indy car racing and

956
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:05.950
stock car racing.
How it's just left turns just left turns,

957
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:10.150
just left turns like why it's harder that there's left and right turns.

958
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:12.940
I finally noticed.
Cause what happens is,

959
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:16.990
is that if there's a left turn and you're on the inside and you get past the guy

960
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:20.560
and then the next turns a right turn,
then he's on the inside.
So it's,

961
00:58:20.561 --> 00:58:24.640
it's actually way more difficult.
You think.
You think,

962
00:58:24.641 --> 00:58:27.250
you know stock car racing,
you get on the inside then yeah,
that's it.

963
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:28.090
You passed the guy.

964
00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:29.220
<v 3>Okay.</v>

965
00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.250
<v 1>Then he's got to try to get inside of you or maybe fucking have somebody draft</v>

966
00:58:32.251 --> 00:58:33.840
behind him or whatever.
But I mean,

967
00:58:33.841 --> 00:58:37.570
there's only so many fucking ways you can go formula one race and you're like,

968
00:58:37.571 --> 00:58:42.540
yeah,
I fucking passed.
Ya know,
I did son of a bitch.
Right.
Um,

969
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:46.110
sorry.
That was way over simplifying something really difficult.
All right,

970
00:58:46.111 --> 00:58:48.900
let's get back.
I just needed a break from that last sentence.
All right.

971
00:58:48.901 --> 00:58:50.760
Another way they're looking into this

972
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.473
<v 3>okay.</v>

973
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.760
<v 1>Is Really fucking horrifying.
The idea is that they can break you down.</v>

974
00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:57.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

975
00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:02.550
<v 1>You're Adams while analyzing exactly how everything was connected and just put</v>

976
00:59:02.711 --> 00:59:05.380
the same elements together on the other side.

977
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.710
This could even work with your brain and memories.

978
00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:09.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

979
00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:14.860
<v 1>What really all of our consciousness is just neurons in certain patterns</v>

980
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:20.680
connected uniquely in each of us based on our DNA and experiences.

981
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.660
Yeah.
Dude.
Like already,
I can tell you this,
like,
you know,

982
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:31.690
you go to Jiffy Lube and their job is literally to change the oil drain oil out

983
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:36.590
and then put other oil n and the amount of times that they forget to put it in

984
00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:41.360
and the person drives away without the oil in there and then the engine seizes.

985
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:42.883
You know what I mean?

986
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:46.970
You think I'm going to go to fucking the Jiffy Lube of teleporting

987
00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:51.650
and I'm gonna roll the dice that they're going to get everything back together

988
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:56.450
again anyways.
He says,
obviously this would be something in the distant future,

989
00:59:56.451 --> 00:59:59.900
but aren't you technically dying every time you go through that?

990
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:05.440
Go through what a clown.
Oh wait.

991
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:09.200
If you were to teleport and a clone with the same memories comes out on the

992
01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:14.150
other side.
It's a weird thought that if this ever became a thing,

993
01:00:14.151 --> 01:00:19.151
everyone using it to communicate every day would be dying twice a day with the

994
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:24.260
clone coming out on the other side.
Yeah.
Dude,
this sounds like a great movie.

995
01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.100
It,

996
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.750
it's fucked up enough that no one else like friends or family would know the

997
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.750
difference,
but even you slash clone,
you wouldn't.

998
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:37.250
If it was good enough that all of the memories came with you,

999
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.800
the clone would just come out the other side.

1000
01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:42.950
Remembering stepping in the receiver a minute ago,

1001
01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.880
even though the version of you that experienced that is dead now.

1002
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.390
Yeah,
so what?
Your soul would know it.

1003
01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.110
Wherever the fuck your soul goes and you'd be standing down,
you know,

1004
01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:56.540
looking down from a cloud or wherever the fuck you go.

1005
01:00:56.850 --> 01:01:00.110
Go on that motherfucker isn't me walking around big in me.

1006
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.880
And he goes,
he goes,
sorry if I,
if I got too weird for you,

1007
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:08.060
but I thought if I experienced,
explained it right,

1008
01:01:08.061 --> 01:01:12.920
this would be at least mildly inches.
Totally interesting.
Um,
even they had that,

1009
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.960
even if they had the technology right now,

1010
01:01:14.961 --> 01:01:18.350
I feel like they would have to slowly work up to this.

1011
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:22.940
Like everyone thought if he had a cell phone,
you reduced,
then everyone had one.

1012
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.560
Now we have like,
now we have shit like Pokemon go every,

1013
01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.740
can I get the rest of this stuff though?
This is,
I thought about,

1014
01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.593
<v 0>you know,</v>

1015
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.140
<v 1>when I was in my early days of traveling,</v>

1016
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:40.460
basically the first 20 years of this shit and I took,
you know,

1017
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:44.510
buses and sat in the back of the plane and all of that type of shit.

1018
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:46.573
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1019
01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.520
<v 1>I remember just thinking that,
uh,</v>

1020
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.160
I just wished that I,
I,
I remember wishing that I had an f 16

1021
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.833
you know,

1022
01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:06.860
and a pilot and that we could somehow fly like whatever,

1023
01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:10.980
2000 miles an hour,
whatever that is,
mock whatever

1024
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.750
across the country and I could get across the country and like an hour and a
half

1025
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:20.100
it just fucking in the thing and have

1026
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.660
<v 0>the guy just push the stick forward.
Whoa.
That's,
that was my big thing.</v>

1027
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.790
I was into bullet trains.

1028
01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:30.990
I was into all of this shit and when I fucking hated was whenever I took the

1029
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:33.780
train from Boston down to New York City,

1030
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:38.340
they had the high speed fucking train and it would go high speed to like

1031
01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:40.140
Stamford,
Connecticut or some shit.

1032
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:44.880
And then they had to stop and change the engine.
So just slow the fuck down.

1033
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.650
Something like that.
You'd have to stop and you'd get behind the slow one.

1034
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:53.580
It just,
it didn't even make any fucking sense to pay all that extra money.

1035
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:56.880
And all you did was shave like 20 minutes off the thing.
So

1036
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:02.160
I've always thought about like,
I,
I would just use teleporting for travel,

1037
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:05.760
you know,
but,
um,

1038
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:11.060
<v 1>I agree with you that you,
you,
you are tech,</v>

1039
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.180
you would be dying if they took you completely apart.

1040
01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.793
<v 0>Like</v>

1041
01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:22.120
<v 1>that is weird.
Like what the f what,
what,</v>

1042
01:03:22.121 --> 01:03:25.660
what exactly would you be like your heart would be completely taken apart.

1043
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.890
First of all to this no fucking way we're ever going to learn how to do that.

1044
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:34.990
There's no way teleporting and time travel and all that shit.
If,

1045
01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.130
if we were going to learn how to do it,
we already would've known about it.

1046
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.721
You know what I mean?

1047
01:03:40.721 --> 01:03:43.360
Cause someone would have done in the future and they would've come back and

1048
01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:47.110
somebody would have said something,
hey,
not for nothing.

1049
01:03:47.111 --> 01:03:49.290
I'm from fucking 2152.

1050
01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:53.320
Just wanted to come back here and uh,
you know,

1051
01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:57.730
just wanted to breathe better,
better air and get away from all those robots,

1052
01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:02.830
you know,
that are running the fucking world.
Um,
all right,
girlfriend leaving.

1053
01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:04.973
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1054
01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.390
<v 1>All right,
dear bill.
Love the podcasts.
All right.</v>

1055
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.680
My girlfriend and I have lived on Long Island.

1056
01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:13.260
Our whole lives go jets,

1057
01:04:13.261 --> 01:04:17.770
go islanders and in a couple of weeks she's moving out to the Midwest.

1058
01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:21.780
So their family,
uh,

1059
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.990
I knew I was going to see her a lot less since we're starting at different

1060
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:26.190
colleges in the fall,

1061
01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:31.290
but I figured we could still give it a go when we come back during breaks and

1062
01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:31.891
stuff.
She's,

1063
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:36.750
my first real girlfriend lost her virginity is teach others other and whatnot.

1064
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:41.250
And I don't know,
man,
this really sucks.
I'm still crazy about her.

1065
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.680
Like to the point where I'm seriously thinking about transferring to another

1066
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:49.700
school next year in a likely futile attempt to keep the dream alive.

1067
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.430
I know,
I know.
Call me an idiot,
but hey,
I'm a dumb teenager.

1068
01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.610
I don't think you're an idiot.
You love the girl.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1069
01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.780
Uh,
this is supposed to be the prime of our lives and I get that,

1070
01:05:00.781 --> 01:05:04.260
but I just don't want it to end with her.
You know,

1071
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:09.320
any advice from you or the lovely Nia on how to make long distance work or

1072
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:13.560
moving on in general would be greatly appreciated.
Um,

1073
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:18.790
this is what she gotta do.
You gotta allow yourself to be the age that you're at.

1074
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:22.930
Okay.
You don't have the answers to these questions.
They're really aren't any,

1075
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.150
each person is unique.

1076
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:30.510
The two of you are unique and all you can do is just tell her how you feel.

1077
01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:35.290
I hope she feels the same way and there's nothing more you can do.

1078
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.730
You know,
it's either going to work out or it isn't.

1079
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:44.630
And I'm,
you know,

1080
01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:49.660
you just have to accept in life that most shit is out of your control and you're

1081
01:05:51.471 --> 01:05:53.510
going to have good days.
You can have bad days,

1082
01:05:53.511 --> 01:05:57.260
you're going to have happiness and you're going to have pain.
And you know,

1083
01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.290
when you go through painful parts of your life,
you just,

1084
01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:05.370
you have to face it and you have to,
uh,
you have to accept it.

1085
01:06:05.371 --> 01:06:09.930
You're not special as far as like,
you know,

1086
01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.660
you're not going to go through life and not get you.

1087
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.430
Everybody's going to get their fair share of heartache every was going to get

1088
01:06:14.431 --> 01:06:18.090
there.
Hopefully their fair share of happiness.
So you know,

1089
01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.520
you're still young.
You got your whole fucking life ahead of you.
Like I said,

1090
01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:27.570
all you can do is just tell this woman how you feel and uh,

1091
01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.310
if it works out,
it works out.
If it doesn't,
it does it.
I can also tell you that,

1092
01:06:32.311 --> 01:06:32.581
you know,

1093
01:06:32.581 --> 01:06:35.790
you're going to be going to a college and there's going to be a bunch of

1094
01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:38.520
beautiful women there.
There's going to be,

1095
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:41.190
college is the greatest fucking nightclub,

1096
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:46.260
like ever,
ever.

1097
01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.110
You know,
you walk into a nightclub,
it's like,
you know,

1098
01:06:49.111 --> 01:06:51.220
the women know why the fuck you there.
So there's,

1099
01:06:51.221 --> 01:06:53.970
they already got their guard up when you go to college,
you know,

1100
01:06:53.971 --> 01:06:58.500
you're going there to go to school.
So everybody's a little more fucking relaxed.

1101
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:03.990
Yeah,
you can go there and you just fucking hit on all of them.
Every fucking one.

1102
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.800
Women that are completely out of your league,
just fucking have a good dude.

1103
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.600
You're fucking,
oh,
I guess you're not single.
You have this girl,

1104
01:07:10.601 --> 01:07:14.940
but I'm just saying if she fucking dump,
shoot dude,
like you're depressed.

1105
01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.010
Your depression,
right,

1106
01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:21.150
of the life that you're going to have after that is you're basically going to be

1107
01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:25.110
a single guy in the prime of your life going to college.

1108
01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:28.010
Like that's not a big dropoff.
You know,

1109
01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.250
you're totally going to be fine.
So like I said,

1110
01:07:31.251 --> 01:07:35.040
just tell this woman how you feel.
If she feels the same way at a workout.

1111
01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:39.540
If it doesn't,
then you're a free man at college.

1112
01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:43.230
And I could tell you this right now as a married guy,

1113
01:07:43.231 --> 01:07:47.480
I can tell you some day you'll be married and you'll have kids and you're going

1114
01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:51.870
to look back when you were single in college with all of those fucking women

1115
01:07:51.871 --> 01:07:55.620
around and you,
you,
you don't want to look back on what the fuck was I thinking?

1116
01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:59.400
I'm not saying going out there and being a fucking man whore,
but go out,

1117
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.930
have a good fucking time.
You know,
dude,

1118
01:08:03.931 --> 01:08:06.930
you're single and Co.
If you end up being single in college,

1119
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.450
the thing that you're kind of afraid of because you don't want to lose this

1120
01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:09.930
woman.

1121
01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.630
This is your basically your drafting in the first round.

1122
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:16.483
Do you know what I mean?

1123
01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:22.940
Like there's so many great catches cause they're all fucking single so you can

1124
01:08:23.251 --> 01:08:26.310
go out and you can,
you can get,
you can get a quality,

1125
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.350
quality fucking woman if you're single and you're in college,
you know,

1126
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.210
the older you get,
you start drafting.
Then the later rounds,
you know you start,

1127
01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:41.640
you know,
you start meeting women with shoes,
women with fucking baggage.

1128
01:08:41.641 --> 01:08:45.570
All the great ones get fucking snapped up.
So you know

1129
01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.920
she's single and make your thirties.

1130
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:53.810
That's when all of a sudden you think he got a number one draft pick and then

1131
01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:57.420
all of a sudden you know,
you end up with like a Greg Oden situation.
Right.

1132
01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:01.980
She got some fucking micro fractures in her feet or some shit or a niece.

1133
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:07.080
I Dunno.
I Dunno what the fuck I'm saying.
I'm just saying like,
like at your age,

1134
01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:12.400
you know,
the hardest thing is you haven't,
you,

1135
01:09:12.401 --> 01:09:13.590
you haven't been older yet.

1136
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:16.980
Like all the people look would look at your situation and just be like,
dude,

1137
01:09:16.981 --> 01:09:20.700
you're in a fucking dream situation.
Um,
but there's,
I,

1138
01:09:20.701 --> 01:09:25.701
there's no way for me to explain that to you because you'd have to be old and

1139
01:09:25.951 --> 01:09:29.880
get married and,
uh,
just be going through the fucking,

1140
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:32.910
the relationship shit.
You know,

1141
01:09:32.911 --> 01:09:36.120
it's just the fucking ups and downs and ups and downs and like,

1142
01:09:36.121 --> 01:09:40.650
now you're fucking legally bound to somebody,

1143
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:46.220
which is fucking insane to begin with.

1144
01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:49.820
And the fact that you're just as you just single,

1145
01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:55.220
you can do whatever the fuck you want to do within reason.
And I don't mean like,

1146
01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:57.830
you know,
he can't go out and buy a yacht.
You don't have the money to do that.

1147
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:01.580
But I'm just saying that you,
you just,
whatever you feel like doing,

1148
01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:04.490
you could basically go do it.
And,
um,

1149
01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:11.340
the thing that I really wish when I was single that I appreciated more was that

1150
01:10:12.311 --> 01:10:15.280
level of freedom.
And then also I wish somebody older.

1151
01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:16.750
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1152
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:17.850
<v 1>Could have told me,</v>

1153
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.530
like really just could have told me like I lucked out with Nia,

1154
01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:26.250
but like summit,
some of the other people that I dated and stuff like that,

1155
01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.130
I mean,
granted it was also 50% me.
Like,

1156
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:32.550
like the level of shit that I put up with when I was younger.

1157
01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.340
Um,
you know,

1158
01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.260
I wish I had like more self esteem,
like,
um,

1159
01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.350
this is obviously for men and women listening to this shit.
Like

1160
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:49.180
if you're with somebody and they a fucking asshole,

1161
01:10:49.181 --> 01:10:52.030
like why would you waste another second of your life with them?

1162
01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:57.220
You know what I mean?
Trying to find reasons to stay with a person.
It's like,

1163
01:10:57.221 --> 01:10:59.830
this person is a fucking asshole.
Okay.

1164
01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:03.970
However you're wired and however they're wired,
it's not working.
Fuck off,

1165
01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:10.050
fuck off.
Get out of my fucking life and just walk away from it.
I mean,
I,

1166
01:11:10.051 --> 01:11:14.160
I learned that so late in life and like I said,

1167
01:11:14.161 --> 01:11:18.510
I just lucked out when I met Nia.
But like,
I,
um,

1168
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:21.660
I had friends in my life that were just fucking assholes.

1169
01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:25.020
And I just remember one day I just woke up and you're like,

1170
01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:27.690
I really shouldn't have to work at being friends with somebody.

1171
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.180
Like this is like work.
I got to sit there and worry.

1172
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.730
How is this person coming at when he and it just,

1173
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:37.350
and then I just got him out of my life and then I just Kinda just,
I dunno,

1174
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.860
came up with some sort of like standard that if someone dip below it,

1175
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:47.870
that that was it.
They were out,
you fucking off the team and now I,
you know,

1176
01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:52.590
I got all these great friends in my life.
I don't have to fucking solid people.

1177
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.020
That's essentially what you look for.

1178
01:11:55.021 --> 01:11:58.140
I know I'm getting off the beaten track here,
but dude,
like you,
you got you.

1179
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:02.520
You're in a dream situation.
Whether this works out or it doesn't,
you know,

1180
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.940
and also as much as it hurts,
if you get your heartbroken,

1181
01:12:05.941 --> 01:12:08.940
it's good to get one of those out of the way.
So you're all good.

1182
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:12.360
You're all fucking good.
I wouldn't worry about shit.

1183
01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.970
Tell her how you fucking feel.

1184
01:12:14.971 --> 01:12:19.080
And she that fucking accepts the fact that you're a number one draft pick or she

1185
01:12:19.081 --> 01:12:22.890
doesn't.
If she doesn't,
it's,
that's her fucking loss and you move on.

1186
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.720
You go to college,
you fucking crush it.
There you go.
Alright,
that's the podcast.

1187
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:29.040
Go fuck yourselves.

1188
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:33.450
Thank you to everyone who came out to my shows in Dublin.

1189
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:37.230
I apologize for the lack of air conditioning.
Um,

1190
01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:40.650
I had such a great time and it's,
it's,
you know,

1191
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.540
it's beyond a thrill to do what I do for a living and have people actually show

1192
01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:47.190
up and want to watch me do it.

1193
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:50.990
Forget about when I leave my country in this people from other countries and

1194
01:12:50.991 --> 01:12:54.060
actually know of what I do and still want to come see me.

1195
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:56.820
It's the fucking greatest thing ever.
And A,

1196
01:12:56.821 --> 01:12:59.280
I'm so psyched to get the first two under my belt.

1197
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:05.370
I'm fucking ready to go tonight.
And Belfast,
I can't fucking wait.

1198
01:13:05.371 --> 01:13:09.990
And uh,
I'm a,
I'm swinging for the fences,

1199
01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:14.520
this whole fucking tour because I'm getting ready.
I'm getting ready for this.

1200
01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.170
I'm going to just be shooting another special,

1201
01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:18.390
I was fucking talking about Hillary last night,

1202
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:23.020
blaming her for Bill Clinton.
Cheat not,

1203
01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.050
it was one of the most ignorant,

1204
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:28.680
stupid fucking things that have ever sat on stage.
It was so fucking stupid.

1205
01:13:28.681 --> 01:13:33.300
People were basically just laughing at me knowing that I was being an ass.

1206
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:36.390
And um,
I dunno.

1207
01:13:36.450 --> 01:13:39.720
It was kind of Nice to have that people use to do that a lot more in comedy

1208
01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:42.390
clubs before this stupid fucking,

1209
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:44.760
I don't know what's going on right now,

1210
01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.910
if everybody taking everything so fucking seriously.
So anyways.
All right,

1211
01:13:47.911 --> 01:13:51.990
I'm babbling here.
Go fuck yourselves.
