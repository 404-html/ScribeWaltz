00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.750

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.400

7
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:28.030
then do the fucking podcast and leave at noon.
That's what I thought.
You know,

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.980
I'm sorry.
Am I still in America?
Checkout time is maybe 11.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.420
Where the fuck is it?
10:00 AM

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.933
<v 2>okay.</v>

11
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.100
<v 1>The fuck is Trump not president anymore.
I mean,</v>

12
00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.320
I thought this was something that he thought he thought he was going to make it

13
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:44.290
great again.
Make it great again.

14
00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:46.120
How be checked out at one in the fucking afternoon.

15
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.630
Once you sign an executive order,
order for that.
Your orange headed content.

16
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.240
How about dad is podcast.
It's not funny.
It's sad.

17
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.770
It's a lonely man by himself.
I'm sorry for the bad Trump impression.

18
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.540
Um,
anyways,
I am in Gainesville,
Florida right now and you probably wondered,
Bill,

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.810
what the fuck are you doing in Gainesville,
Florida?
Home with the Florida gators.

20
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.370
You know,

21
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.510
you're on there either in a fucking Monday and it's not football season.

22
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.380
Why are you here?

23
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.790
It's a cause I have to do the makeup date for the show that I was going to do

24
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.630
back in November when I was going to go to the Florida gators game down there at

25
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:23.680
the fucking swamp.

26
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.770
I was going to do that and go to the Florida gator Lsu game and

27
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.450
that game got rained out.
Whatever.
They had a fucking hurricane.

28
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.390
Everybody freaked out cause Jacksonville was going to get the shit kicked out of

29
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:41.890
him.
Gay Gainesville was,
you know,
as far as I'm concerned it was safe.

30
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.230
You know,
my complete lack of a meteorology logical background.

31
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:50.920
Is that the right word?
I don't know.
So I'm back here.
I'm back here,
you know,

32
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.050
in February
when nothing's going on.
Oh Shit.

33
00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:58.870
What about their team?
What if they're fucking team has a good basketball team,

34
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:02.530
has a game tonight.
Maybe that's it.
Maybe that's what's going on.

35
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:06.130
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
um,

36
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.670
I'm here in fucking day.
Uh,
Gainesville,
uh,

37
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.730
had a great time this whole weekend being out there and not Daytona,

38
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.240
Daytona Beach,
Florida,
and,
uh,

39
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.030
Jesus Christ to some of the fucking locals in Daytona.

40
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.580
Your heart just goes out to them.
You know what I mean?
It's just these studies,

41
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.370
all these things.
It's all those people that,
that people in Hollywood trash,

42
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.630
you know what I mean?
It's just a bunch of,
you know,

43
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:34.480
a lot of fucking white people that are just,

44
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:38.740
Jesus' life is just fucking kick the shit out of him.

45
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.030
Not saying everybody,
but I'm just saying,

46
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.130
I fucking came into town

47
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.260
fucking walking down the street the first night I got video of this.
I'm,

48
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.690
I'm walking and there's like a fight about rate of breakout outside of a pizza

49
00:02:55.691 --> 00:03:00.250
joint.
And everybody there was like my age,
except they look my age,

50
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:02.740
you know what I mean?
They might have a better hairline,
which isn't hard with me,

51
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.810
but they're just fucking fat.

52
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.340
<v 1>Fucking big fat.
Fucking,
uh,
was that price low sex shit that people eat?</v>

54
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.833
That was it called.

55
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.950
<v 1>That Shit Larry,
the cable guy talks about right.
He goes,
fucking proud sex,
ATC,</v>

57
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.690
when you fucking go out and you eat a whole fucking pig and you Starbucks,
like,

58
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:24.310
what the fuck did you just do to me?

59
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.700
Rather than not eaten a whole fucking pig again,

60
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.720
you can take this shit and I'll make it feel like eating a whole pig yourself is

61
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.920
okay.
That shit,
they had those bodies,

62
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.390
lot of cargo shorts that were just frayed at the bottom.
A lot of bad tattoos.

63
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:46.800
A lot of fucking people that look like,
even if they weren't on drugs,
you know,

64
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:48.660
when people do drugs for so fucking long,

65
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:52.830
there's only so coherent that you can get back to.

66
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.150
We went to this fucking restaurant right on the Strip and uh,

67
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.470
his fucking lady,
Jesus Christ,
if she wasn't high,
she just does.

68
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.240
She had just done so many fucking drugs.
She brought the fucking wings over,

69
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:11.560
right?
And they were like,
they weren't ice cold.
They will room temperature,

70
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:16.060
which is fucking ice cold.
And I'm like,
yeah.
Uh,
and I hate sending food back.

71
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.280
We're sitting in this fucking restaurant,
right?
And we sitting in a,

72
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:24.870
it's like basically a NASCAR because we're there to go to the Daytona 500 the

73
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.240
next day.
Right.
It's like a NASCAR that they cut in half and put a booth in the,

74
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:29.280
in the middle of it,
right.

75
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.263
<v 3>MMM.</v>

76
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.970
<v 1>Assumption.
I Dunno what the fuck it is.</v>

77
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.600
And we looked up later and evidently this was the worst restaurant me and Nate

78
00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:42.180
ended up going to this fucking thing.
Ended up being the worst restaurant.

79
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.330
It wasn't bad.
I ordered the fucking,
it looks shady

80
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.540
in the music they were playing.
They were playing like Zz top.
She's got legs.

81
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.540
They played George Thorogood twice.

82
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.900
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.670
<v 1>Uh,
they played,
yes.
Owner of a lonely heart.
I was just sitting there.
It fell.</v>

84
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:00.920
He goes,

85
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.020
1985 I was joking on stage that night I was wearing fucking Marty McFly to come

86
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:09.940
walking in keyword there,
fly and um,

87
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.200
to see some guy walking around sort of mouthing the words.

88
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.830
<v 1>To this joy.
And it wasn't even a good George Thorogood song.</v>

90
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:22.180
It wasn't bad to the bone or a that whatever,
that fucking whiskey whiskey,

91
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:27.080
one scotch or one beer wasn't that one.
It was at the,

92
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.490
that cover their dad,
dad,
my back door.

93
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.880
Now my bitch don't come no more.

94
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.870
Bhuvan over rocking down over it.
Just sitting there going,

95
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.704
oh my God.

96
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.793
<v 3>MMM.</v>

97
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.350
<v 1>The waitress fucked up every possible way she could have fucked up other than</v>

98
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:48.300
just blowing your nose into the bread.
I mean,
other than that shit,

99
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.680
every fucking thing you could do,
she fucked up.
It was hilarious.
I've,

100
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.150
I felt bad for,
I could see,
you know,
she just,
you know,
we all do it.

101
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.870
We all do it in business.
We stay out there too long.
Madonna did it,
you know,

102
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:01.890
she still twerk and she's like 60 it's like,

103
00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:06.770
but Donna for the love of fucking God,
can you dress your age?
Okay.

104
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.400
Could you have a shred of fucking decency for yourself so that people can just

105
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.450
any general sense,
look in your,
your,
your direction.
You know what I mean?

106
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.230
There was a bunch of guys down on Daytona beach dressing the way Madonna was

107
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:24.561
dressing.

108
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:29.561
There was a bunch of fucking guys my age still wearing tank tops where your arms

109
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.420
have no muscle definition anymore.
It's just us.

110
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.170
It looks like in order it looks like,
it looks like,

111
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.860
you know when somebody has like cankles you know that part of the leg where it

112
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.840
just,
you know,
there's no shape to the calf.

113
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.610
That's what the arm looks like and it's all fucking flabby and just these awful

114
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.650
horrific fucking tattoos.
Um,
just shit.

115
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:53.060
You pick off a wall,

116
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.600
somebody with the shakes just puts it on your fucking arm.
And so she comes over,

117
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.640
by the way,
when you go into a place like that,
because once I sit down,

118
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:07.100
I'm not leaving,
just go with the grilled cheese.

119
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.250
You get a grilled cheese sandwich and what can they do?
You know what I mean?

120
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.290
Fucking Nate odor to Hamburg.
And I was just like,
all right dude.
You know,

121
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.210
but if you get fucking a bowler,
I mean,

122
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.510
I don't want to hear your bitching about it and what does we equal lie whatever

123
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:24.190
you get.
I knew it was something with an e.
So she comes over and she's just say,

124
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.180
Hey,
well,
it was like one in the afternoon,

125
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.440
the sun just fucking blazing through the windows,
just like,
Hey,
welcome.

126
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.730
I'm going to be a waitress through this this evening.

127
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.650
And she caught herself saying evening and she just fucking plowed forward.
Uh,

128
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.430
you know,
[inaudible] uh,
uh,
it was like listening to it.

129
00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:47.000
It was like literally like listening to a cell phone going in and out.
Right.

130
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.760
And um,
she brings the fucking orders over it.

131
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:54.350
She kept going,
how,
how's your meat?

132
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.550
Which I've never heard anybody say that I order a burger and the wings,

133
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.620
I've got a little dangerous with the fucking winks.

134
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.080
And I had the grilled cheese sandwich.

135
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.590
I think it was just too much for a fucking blown out brain to try to remember

136
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:09.980
what kind of protein we ordered.
So she just kept coming over going has to me,

137
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.720
she came over,
she gave me the Burger,

138
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.660
she gave Nate the fucking grilled cheese sandwich where to swing that fucking

139
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.190
thing around.
The chicken was fucking stone cold.

140
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.600
And she says she started like turn sideways when she fucked up the order and she

141
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:27.170
was like almost trying to hide behind our own shoulder.
She's like,
ah,

142
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:31.260
I'm fine to have the manager take it off and really apologize.
Uh,

143
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.840
and she fucking disappears and comes back two seconds later,

144
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.630
which was a big thing in Daytona

145
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.550
ordering food that should have taken at least 15 minutes.

146
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:45.260
And it returned in like two seconds.

147
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.770
It was very disturbing because the first night when we saw those fucking old

148
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:52.790
guys with the flabby arms pushing each other outside that fucking pizza parlor,

149
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.050
<v 3>well let</v>

150
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.580
<v 1>me,
I'll take it to the whole fucking shit show.</v>

151
00:08:57.581 --> 00:09:01.960
We went into this place that we thought was a Hooters,
a fucking,

152
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.050
who knows?
And I'm like,
I'm not eating it here.

153
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.470
Any place that that is sort of in the sex industry.

154
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.440
It's got one foot in the sex industry.
I'm not ordering food.

155
00:09:11.441 --> 00:09:15.820
And so I went in there and got a beer and we walked in and the chicks didn't

156
00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:16.654
have holders,

157
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.070
but they all had ashes and they had shorts like up their ass.

158
00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:25.240
Like half their fucking ass was hanging out.
And it was just,
you know,

159
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.160
it was a shit show.
And what trying to figure it out,
we're like going,

160
00:09:30.161 --> 00:09:30.791
what the fuck?

161
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:35.791
What the kind of fucking who does this is holders finally admitting that hip hop

162
00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:40.270
went mainstream about 25 years ago and now they're focusing on ashes.

163
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.710
And um,
wasn't till the next day we walked out,

164
00:09:44.711 --> 00:09:48.730
we realized it wasn't a Hooters,
it was some wings joint.
And uh,

165
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.310
I think they're going to put Hooters out of business cause I don't think people

166
00:09:51.311 --> 00:09:53.650
care about Teddy's anymore.
You know what I mean?

167
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.930
Plus you can have a nice rack and like you fucking ass could be as flat as a God

168
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.800
damn fucking desk desktop.
Right.
You know what I mean?

169
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.810
So and then,
then I'm going to get,
and then you just gotta,

170
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:07.240
you gotta get a pair of tents,
you know,
what do you,

171
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:08.074
what are you gonna do with that?

172
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.860
I love an ass and you can't have a nice ass and be out of shape,

173
00:10:14.861 --> 00:10:17.590
but just doesn't fucking work.
That is the nucleus of the body.

174
00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:20.260
If that's fucking in shape,
then everything else is fine.

175
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.910
You can have a fucking pair of tits on.
You get what I mean?
And,

176
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:26.560
and it could just be a shit show when you go south.
You know what I mean?

177
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.880
That's like a,
you know,
guys,
when they fucking,
they,
oh they keep lifting weights,

178
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:31.721
you know,

179
00:10:31.721 --> 00:10:34.780
and they just keep trying to keep their chest out in front of their beer belly

180
00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:37.180
and they keep pushing the genes down further and further.

181
00:10:37.181 --> 00:10:41.530
So they still have to have 32 inch Jane.
You know,
by the way,

182
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:45.610
I think white people were the first one to wear saggy jeans.
You know,

183
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.780
I think we were the first ones to do it.

184
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:53.781
And that was what the guys who just refuse to buy a 34 inch than a 36 38 inch

185
00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:54.540
waist.

186
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.140
They just kept pushing it down and letting their fucking stomach come out over

187
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:02.940
the top.
So anyways,

188
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.760
she's like hide behind her shoulder going on.

189
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.480
So I've managed to take it out of there.

190
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.990
So she fucking the Oh no,
I know,
I remember I was trying to say,
yeah,

191
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:14.910
how quickly the food keeps.
So the night before we went out,

192
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.500
after we left the fucking,
uh,

193
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.860
the bar where these girls had to walk around with half of their fucking ass is

194
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:24.400
hanging out.
Um,
and now that I'm a dad,

195
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:26.830
it was even worse.
I just kept thinking,

196
00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:28.720
what if my daughter ends up working and this is for what?

197
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.930
I wanted to meet the father of all these guys and be like,

198
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.650
what did you do that had them end up here?
So I don't do it.

199
00:11:35.651 --> 00:11:40.300
So my daughter doesn't end up here.
So we go down the fucking street and uh,

200
00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:44.020
we go to this other fucking bar.
Do like they got a biker bar down there.

201
00:11:44.021 --> 00:11:46.320
Cause you know they Tona has that fucking crazy biker.

202
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.040
We could sub shit out here.
And I'm just like,
all right,

203
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:51.700
I am not a biker and I'm not going to go in there and get fucking,
you know,

204
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.390
I dunno,
a pool cue fucking shoved in my year.
I don't need this shit.
Right.

205
00:11:55.391 --> 00:12:00.340
So we go to this other bar,
sort of a sports bar.
We walk in,
everything's cool.

206
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.010
So I ordered some food,
I go,
let me get the uh,
what's,

207
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.840
what's the raw tuna?
It's not Shashimi as a tuna tar,
tar,
tar,

208
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:15.470
tar.
Is that what I ordered?
You know,
and,
and you know this fucking sports bar.

209
00:12:15.471 --> 00:12:17.830
Why would you,
why would you order raw fish in a place like that?

210
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:21.760
It's fucking nuts.
But I did an I chips and salsa and I swear to God,

211
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:24.550
this woman walked into the kitchen,

212
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:26.520
they had the in in the outdoor and you're swinging doors.

213
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.060
She walked in there in the doorway,

214
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.120
puppet put went and then she came walking right back out and she put the fucking

215
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:35.980
food like to stuck disturbingly,

216
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.900
like it came back so fucking fast to look at my face.

217
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.340
Nate was fucking crying,
laughing and uh,

218
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.540
all I can say about the food is you shouldn't have to chew raw tuna.

219
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.820
It should be like butter,
like melts in your mouth kind of thing.
And I,

220
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:56.480
and I was chewing the shit out of it.

221
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.540
So anyways,
back to the fuck another place,
you know,

222
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.490
it's just so stupid then I'm fucking shitting on the food there.
When,

223
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:08.510
when you're sitting in a fucking NASCAR that's been cut in half and they put a

224
00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:11.510
fucking booth in the middle of it,
can you really complain about the food?
Well,

225
00:13:11.511 --> 00:13:14.740
you know what,
I have an hour to fill here,
so I've got it.
Um,

226
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.550
so this poor woman who probably had some Shitty Dad,
she ended up doing drugs.

227
00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:22.550
He's trying to get a fucking order,
right?
And,
uh,
you know,

228
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:27.020
the guy's walking around Mauldin the words moving on over.
And,
uh,

229
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.530
this guy in the corner starts eating this burger dude and I can't even tell the

230
00:13:30.531 --> 00:13:32.720
way he was fucking attacking this burger.

231
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.740
I was crying and laughing and I had to let you know I had to do like that,

232
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.100
you know,

233
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.990
you know when you're with somebody and you're the person you're laughing at kind

234
00:13:41.991 --> 00:13:44.610
of catches you looking at them and then you want your friend to look at them

235
00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:47.820
tube.
So you got to do like that kind of that stretch thing where you look back.

236
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.560
Fortunately it was a flat flat screen TV above his head and I just sorta like

237
00:13:52.561 --> 00:13:54.090
without even blinking for toilet Chris,

238
00:13:54.091 --> 00:13:56.370
just one like just turn around and look at the two day,
you know,

239
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.420
did like one of those things to the way this guy would it say he attacked this

240
00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:05.160
burger.
Like he,
he lunged at it rather than like,

241
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.600
it was almost like his,

242
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.370
it was someone else who was holding it was the one he's trying to steal a bite

243
00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:13.980
as somebody else's burger.
That's the way this guy was eating.

244
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.570
Like his first bite into the Burger.
He fucking lunged at it so hard.

245
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.840
He hit himself in the face with like the lettuce.

246
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.870
They're this big piece of like fucking Romaine lettuce hanging off to sell

247
00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:31.010
whatever the fuck it was.
Iceberg lettuce.
And when he lunged in at it,
it like,

248
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.810
it fucking hit him in one of his eyes and he had a stop and blink and then he

249
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:39.230
just fucking,
he came up higher and just lunged at it again.

250
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.550
He was eating it like a,
like a fucking Komodo Dragon,
you know,

251
00:14:43.551 --> 00:14:45.200
they just sort of fucking lunch at something.

252
00:14:45.201 --> 00:14:49.490
He just just saw and rip away as it was a fucking animal.

253
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.380
And every,
he would lunge it.
This thing,
it was,
I could not look at him.

254
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:58.850
And I was crying,
laughing
of course,
by three bites.

255
00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:01.070
He looked over and he caught me looking at him laughing.

256
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.020
And then I looked at Nate and I pointed at the menu like I was laughing like,

257
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:08.540
oh my God,
they have chicken fingers.
Isn't that hilarious?
Like,

258
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:11.930
I was trying to somehow get away from it.
But,
um,
long story short,

259
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.130
<v 3>yeah,</v>

260
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.770
<v 1>the grilled cheese was our right.
The fucking wings were horrific.</v>

261
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:20.570
Even when they were actually heated up.
Um,
they clearly made them hours ago,

262
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.610
the way they came over fucking ice cold.

263
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:26.570
And then they brought me some hot ones like three seconds later.

264
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.460
And so the lady comes over and she picks up our check.

265
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.980
She walks over the register in the,
in that short amount of time,

266
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:41.960
she already forgot where we were sitting.
And then when she came back,
you know,

267
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:43.940
Nate picked up the check.
She gave it back to me.

268
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:46.550
It was just was fucking horrific,
man.

269
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.253
<v 3>MMM.</v>

270
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.870
<v 1>But other than that,
they told her beach was beautiful.
We did a show that night.</v>

271
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:55.250
Everyone would be like,
what are you shitting on?
Fuck it.

272
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.400
They told her fault because that's what I saw.
I didn't know where to go.

273
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.900
So anyways,
I,
um,
I played the,
uh,

274
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.360
I want to say PBD theater because where I'm from,
that's how you say Peabody.

275
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.260
Peabody theater.
It's like when you need,
when you're in New York,

276
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:16.610
it's Carnegie Hall.
And when you're in Pittsburgh,
it's Carnegie.
All right?

277
00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:18.650
When you're in Massachusetts,
it's,
it's PBD

278
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.803
<v 3>and</v>

279
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.460
<v 1>everywhere else it's Peabody.
So we played the Peabody theater.</v>

280
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.170
I had a great time,
did an hour and 20 minutes,
you know,
all new shit.

281
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.720
Shit that got left off of other hours.
Just had a great fucking time.

282
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.560
The crowd was awesome.
Got a bunch of heckles,
but they were all great.
I liked,

283
00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:39.360
I liked that shit.
I don't mind when people yell out.
Yeah.

284
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.943
<v 3>MMM.</v>

285
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.240
<v 1>You know,
to a point.
I don't mind it.</v>

286
00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:46.270
And I had a good time and I made a point of saying that because sometimes people

287
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.390
in the crowd was sorry for all the fucking heckles.
I enjoy it.

288
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.280
I don't mind a lively drunk ass crowd.
I'm a fucking drunk.
Okay.

289
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.050
And now that I've shit on everybody,

290
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.600
you know that I met basically in a 12 hour period in Daytona.

291
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.193
<v 3>MMM.</v>

292
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.190
<v 1>Let's talk about the,
uh,
we went to the race the next day,
and by the way,</v>

293
00:17:08.191 --> 00:17:09.810
thank you to everybody who came out to the show.
I mean,

294
00:17:09.811 --> 00:17:12.300
what's such a big fucking event the next day?

295
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.130
I mean they should have been three people in the crowd.

296
00:17:14.131 --> 00:17:17.040
So the fact that it was sold,
that was fucking amazing.
So thank you to everybody.

297
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.500
I will definitely be back.
Uh,

298
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.550
but I will not be eating at that fucking place with the cars that are sawed in

299
00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:24.350
half.

300
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.183
<v 3>Uh,</v>

301
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.310
<v 1>so anyways,
plowing ahead here.
So the next day we go to the race and uh,</v>

302
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.290
we weren't really thinking that there's going to be 250,000 fucking people.

303
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.930
That's like two and a half rose bowls all descending on the same fucking

304
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.040
<v 3>okay.</v>

305
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.330
<v 1>The same place.
So,</v>

306
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.680
<v 3>okay.</v>

307
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.350
<v 1>All the locals are going like,
Oh man,
I'm just staying in tomorrow.</v>

308
00:17:46.351 --> 00:17:47.640
That's going to be a shit show.

309
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.640
Blahblahblahblahblah and when had driven from the airport,
you know,

310
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.300
when you get off,
what's so fucking cool when you get off at the airport,

311
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.700
you can actually hear them racing.
You know,

312
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.660
I think there was a truck race or some shit like that if you land,
you know,

313
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.230
I didn't get into like fucking one in the morning,
midnight actually.

314
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.380
So the race was already over born.
Nick got there,
you could hear him racing,

315
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.960
you pull out,
you can see the fucking day,

316
00:18:10.961 --> 00:18:15.780
Tony International fucking speedway,
which is amazing,
right?
Legendary place.

317
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.370
And as you're driving by this,

318
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:20.940
all these fucking people in Rv's and all that hanging out,

319
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:25.941
wait to go in the race and do these people do not fuck around

320
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.190
the way they were doing it up.

321
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.320
Like it's the way I wish we did it at the Rose Bowl.

322
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.410
Like I've never seen so many.
Like

323
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.320
I mean legit like you could,

324
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:40.920
you could like a rock star could tour in some of these fucking mobile homes.

325
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.770
Um,
and the setups that they had and the fucking flat screen TVs,

326
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:47.481
you know,

327
00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:52.481
on the outside with the generator and they had smokers going and everybody just

328
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:55.890
having a great fucking time waiting for this race to happen.

329
00:18:55.891 --> 00:19:00.040
And evidently people who park on the infield can get there like some,

330
00:19:00.041 --> 00:19:04.970
like a week or 10 days,
they've just been in there.
This,

331
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.940
these guys are fucking driving around the track,
you know,

332
00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:10.920
getting ready to go to the race and all that.
You know,

333
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.020
testing out their cars and shit.

334
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.970
I'm qualifying for pole position or whatever the fuck it is that they're doing.

335
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.970
These people are sitting there like to me though,
that's it.

336
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.680
That throws a diehard fans,
right?

337
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.350
So we ended up calling a fucking Oba,
um,

338
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.680
the venue the night before hooked us up with this guy,
this driver.
And um,

339
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.720
he knew all these back ways to get there,
which was a godsend.

340
00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:37.750
And he got us like right to where it says,
um,

341
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.620
Daytona International speedway and uh,
Nate Barr,

342
00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:44.980
God sees like hooked up with some of those NASCAR guys and they came by about 20

343
00:19:44.981 --> 00:19:45.814
minutes later,

344
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:51.090
picked us up in this little golf cart and just gave us the total VIP treatment.

345
00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:56.110
And this is the one thing I will say about Nascar versus the NFL is the level of

346
00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:01.540
fan access
to all these different do you can,

347
00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:03.430
you can walk right down on the pit row.

348
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.920
We were sitting on the track before the race,

349
00:20:05.921 --> 00:20:08.620
like a couple hours before the race.
They let you go up there.

350
00:20:08.621 --> 00:20:12.340
Everybody was like taking pictures at the finish line.
And,
um,

351
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.130
one thing I couldn't believe was how fucking small it is as far as the width of

352
00:20:18.131 --> 00:20:22.030
it.
It's like these people will go three side by side,
200 miles an hour.

353
00:20:22.031 --> 00:20:25.990
They out of their minds.
Um,
you got to be right down there on pit row.

354
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.340
Uh,

355
00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.110
I met Mario and Dreddy got to shake his hand and a,

356
00:20:32.111 --> 00:20:33.320
that was another thing too,
like the,

357
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.660
just the array of like famous people that were there.

358
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:43.300
I guess the appeal of Nascar,
it was fucking nuts.
Like you'd see Mario Andretti,

359
00:20:43.301 --> 00:20:48.220
which makes sense.
Race car driver.
I Gronk Koski

360
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.680
<v 2>yeah.</v>

361
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.670
<v 1>Um,
Guy Fieri.
Uh,</v>

362
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.620
who else?
There was some fucking model,
this gorgeous model there.

363
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.220
Kiano Reeves.
Let Damien,
Tom Wilson,
it was just fucking,

364
00:21:05.221 --> 00:21:08.880
it was like all over the fucking map and you'd see like,
oh,
that guy,

365
00:21:08.881 --> 00:21:12.090
he's the senator of fucking,
you know,
whatever.
South Carolina.

366
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.693
<v 3>MMM.</v>

367
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.590
<v 1>We got to go in and you know,</v>

368
00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:18.020
we got to sit in on like the driver's meeting and all of that,

369
00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:19.550
which is really fucking interesting.

370
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.280
I thought it was just going to be the drivers and like four of us,

371
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:26.270
but it was this giant fucking room where they let this whole crowd go into.

372
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:31.100
Is this sitting there talking to the drivers going,
all right,
uh,
you know,

373
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.830
it's been a lot of,
uh,
trying to bump guys off the track into the fucking stands.

374
00:21:36.831 --> 00:21:38.350
You gotta stop doing that.
I mean,
I don't know why.

375
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:40.380
I didn't even know what they was.
Sam's kind of sitting behind the guy,

376
00:21:40.381 --> 00:21:43.720
so it couldn't quite hear him.
But,
um,
I mean,

377
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.440
I can't imagine going into like a fucking

378
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.210
any NFL game and he got to hear the referees talking to the head coaches before

379
00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:52.670
the game.
You know,
the NFL is like the God Damn Cia.

380
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.840
You can't get anywhere near anything.
So,
um,
we ended up,
uh,

381
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.770
watching the race from the infield and uh,

382
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.090
you know,
I knew some people there.
So we were,
at one point we were with,
um,

383
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.410
the people from Cisco brewery down on Nantucket.
If you ever go to Nantucket,
um,

384
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.710
crazy good beer.
And then they got the,
this vodka,

385
00:22:15.711 --> 00:22:19.430
they have like this blueberry vodka and cranberry vodka that you fucking lady's

386
00:22:19.431 --> 00:22:20.264
gonna love.

387
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.943
<v 3>And,
um,</v>

388
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.020
<v 1>we hung with them for awhile and then we also were at this other fucking place</v>

389
00:22:27.021 --> 00:22:30.680
in our view was absolutely insane.
It was a bunch of fucking,

390
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.100
I dunno,
crashes and cautions,
it's to fucking race took forever,
but

391
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.073
<v 3>mmm.</v>

392
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.330
<v 1>I Dunno.
I can't,
I still can't believe that I got to go,
go to it.</v>

393
00:22:41.331 --> 00:22:44.000
But thank you to everybody at Nascar for hooking us up.

394
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.440
<v 3>And,
um,</v>

395
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.460
<v 1>I'm trying to remember who the fuck one was it Kyle Busch cow Bush one.
Right.</v>

396
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.420
I went there and I just routed for fucking Dale Earnhardt jr Jr.
You know,

397
00:22:53.421 --> 00:22:55.370
it's been so long since I've watched Nascar.
I'm like,

398
00:22:55.371 --> 00:22:57.950
is Jeff Gordon is still racing?
Is like,
Nah,
he's retired.

399
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.600
Like everybody I knew was gone.

400
00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:04.010
Like I watched it big time in the early fucking eighties,
late seventies,

401
00:23:04.011 --> 00:23:08.720
early eighties when it was like Bobby Allenson,
Cale Yarborough,

402
00:23:08.721 --> 00:23:13.400
Harry Gant,
Richard Petty.
I saw him when like his last day tone of 500,

403
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:17.990
my 81 or something.
Um,
then Cale Yarborough one to two years in a row.

404
00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:22.430
Then it was a bill Elliot era.
And,
um,
I don't know,
somewhere around there,

405
00:23:22.431 --> 00:23:25.280
I was trying to get through college and I started doing standup and I kind of

406
00:23:25.281 --> 00:23:29.360
lost touch with it,
but I,
I still paid attention,
um,

407
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.820
right through the Dale Earnhardt years and,
uh,
I dunno,

408
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.010
I haven't watched it in a minute,
but it's,
it's fucking amazing dude.

409
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.290
The whole thing.
It was just such an amazing experience.
And I'm on,
I don't know,

410
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.030
maybe I'll go to Talladega.
Who knows?
I think that one's in May.
We'll see.

411
00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.460
But the big thing I was excited was the fact that,
uh,

412
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.060
I was able to do like an hour and 20 minutes in that bore people shit that

413
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:54.200
they'd already heard before.
So,
um,
you know,
that's like the big fear.

414
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

415
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.030
<v 1>When you go back out on the road after you had a special commodities,</v>

416
00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.680
you were like,
all right,

417
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.450
how do I fucking do a bunch of new shit without fucking these people over?
Sorry,

418
00:24:03.451 --> 00:24:07.410
I'm adjusting the microphone here without fucking these people over.
Um,

419
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.900
and I'm still thinking that I was funny,

420
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.700
especially after going on after Nate Barr.

421
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.710
Godsey who by the way is I'm one of like six people that got half hours on a,

422
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.530
on Netflix.
I think Netflix is trying to do like the HBO one night stands.

423
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.630
So he was running his ready to tape special in front of me and that guy's one of

424
00:24:28.631 --> 00:24:30.790
the best joke writers I know and he fucking murdered.

425
00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:33.880
So I was relieved that I was able to,
uh,

426
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.230
go on after him and have a good time.
So anyways,
is it time?
Yeah.

427
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.810
How about a little bit of advertising here?
Everybody.
All right,

428
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.850
where are we wondering the fuck is this stuff?

429
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.500
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

430
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.090
<v 1>Never heard of this one.
Wondery um,
here's a podcast you should listen to.</v>

431
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.100
Wait a minute.
Somebody else's podcast is advertising in my podcasts.
Yeah.

432
00:24:57.101 --> 00:25:00.790
Don't listen to my podcasts.
Listen to this one.
All right.
What?

433
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:04.630
I remember this shit.
This one's actually sounded cool.
All right.
Uh,
secrets,

434
00:25:04.631 --> 00:25:09.310
crimes and audio tape.
It's a podcast that has a different story every week.

435
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.690
Uh,
this week story is called,
this is not a Banksy.

436
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.390
It's about a guy who wakes up in the morning and realizes Banksy drew on his

437
00:25:19.391 --> 00:25:23.350
ass.
Who the fuck is Banksy?

438
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.760
He gets it tattooed and now people want to collect his ass.

439
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:32.560
It doesn't go well.
It was,
it has high production values.

440
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:37.570
It's funny.
And Mario Lopez is the guest star.
Go listen to it.
All right.

441
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.140
This is why I liked that podcast is because it sounds different and that also

442
00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:45.810
the copy was nice and short.
Is Banksy,
uh,
he's an,
he's an artist,
right?

443
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.580
I only know this because Nias into all that shit.
Let me,

444
00:25:48.581 --> 00:25:49.570
let me look this fucking up.

445
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.600
So he drew on somebody's ass and then he had it tattooed.

446
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:54.723
<v 3>And now what?</v>

447
00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.900
<v 1>Who the fuck is Banksy?
Banksy is an anonymous English-based graffiti artists,</v>

448
00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.450
political activists and film director.
Well,
if it's anonymous,

449
00:26:06.451 --> 00:26:11.250
how can they know who he is?
Um,
of unverified identity.
Oh,

450
00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:14.790
there you go.
There's sacked lyrical street art and subversive.

451
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.060
Well then how the fuck did this guy know Banksy drew on his ass?

452
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.740
Mandy's got great work.

453
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.180
<v 2>Okay.</v>

454
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.730
<v 1>I'm going to judge them on the two that are on his whipping Wikipedia page.
Oh,</v>

455
00:26:26.731 --> 00:26:31.190
these are amazing.
What a talented son of a bitch.
He must be really shy.

456
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.073
<v 3>MMM.</v>

457
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.860
<v 1>So he does this in England.
What if it's,</v>

458
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.750
what if it's somebody from the royal family?

459
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.060
And the reason why they don't say it is because,
you know,

460
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.550
graffiti's looked down upon by the,
uh,
the aristocrats,
you know,

461
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:49.530
stop drawing on our buildings.
Um,
maybe that's who it is.

462
00:26:49.531 --> 00:26:51.270
So I guess he drawing somebody's ass.

463
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.130
Somebody who knows him well.
Well,
I'm surprised the,
uh,

464
00:26:57.131 --> 00:27:00.820
the Illuminati doesn't kidnap that dude in his ass.
And he goes,

465
00:27:00.821 --> 00:27:02.320
tell me who the fuck Banksy is.

466
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:03.680
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

467
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.620
<v 1>Jimmy,
who Banksy is,</v>

468
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.120
or I'll fucking scalp your ass and that painting and then your ass won't work

469
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:12.300
and it won't be worth shit.
How about that?

541
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:46.580
I'm going to be certain posts,
some videos up to my youtube,

546
00:32:02.061 --> 00:32:06.770

All right,
so speaking of stamps,

547
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.570
I bought some stamps today.

548
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.600
I did not use stamps.com I was driving from a Daytona beach up here to

549
00:32:14.631 --> 00:32:18.030
Gainesville.
And rather than going like the highway way,
I,

550
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.650
I w I took the longer route cause I want to see some shit.
Right.

551
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.500
Like going by these fucking,

552
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:26.483
<v 2>okay.</v>

553
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.390
<v 1>My brother told me it's called folk art.
I guess I drove by this woman's house.</v>

554
00:32:30.391 --> 00:32:32.490
So this guy's house,
I don't know.
I thought it was a woman,

555
00:32:32.491 --> 00:32:37.170
but you don't have like a giant tyrannosaurus rex,
a fucking bull.

556
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.460
Like kicking his legs up.

557
00:32:38.461 --> 00:32:43.010
Like all these giant things that you can put on your fucking lawn.
I guess.

558
00:32:43.011 --> 00:32:45.190
I don't know what all this crazy stuff that,
you know,

559
00:32:45.191 --> 00:32:47.390
you don't see that when you take 75 north,

560
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.800
it's just going to be a bunch of Arby's.
We got the meats.

561
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:55.310
It's going to be the same fucking 10 chains and a god Damn Walmart.

562
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:58.760
I've seen that a zillion times.
But if he,
if he'd take the old school,
the,

563
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.600
the fucking route 66 Jack Kerouac ways,
it takes longer,

564
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.880
but you see a bunch of cool shit.
So I was fucking driving along there and uh,

565
00:33:06.881 --> 00:33:10.340
I came upon a post office and Lo and behold,
I had a,

566
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.520
I had a built that I need to pay and I didn't have a fucking stamp,

567
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.600
so I fucking pull in and the local center in there.

568
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.490
And I'm listening to this guy tell his fucking hilarious story.
Uh,

569
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.660
first of all,
I love the pace of it too.

570
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:26.750
I love the pace of a small town where I don't give a shit that this guy's

571
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:29.210
telling the story.
He's such a fucking character.
I'm enjoying it.

572
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.650
I'm already second in line because there's nobody fucking there.
Right?

573
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.730
And he's telling his story about how somebody cut him off,

574
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.820
you know,
and it's not driving too fast.

575
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:44.870
And then the woman behind the counter then tells her story about how she was

576
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:48.560
doing 15 someone pulled out in front of her and her son and his son blew the

577
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:53.280
horn.
And when they pulled up next to him at a red light,
the guy fucking head,

578
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.380
he had a pistol and he fucking just brought it up looking at him like,
you know,

579
00:33:57.381 --> 00:34:00.350
pointing at the ceiling of his car.
He just sort of brought it up like that.

580
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.170
And then the guy's like,
egos can't do that.
Can't do that.
I write dad,

581
00:34:05.171 --> 00:34:07.850
such a terrorist act that's brand is should brandishing a weapon.

582
00:34:07.851 --> 00:34:11.000
And you started talking about brandishing a weapon.
You can't do that.

583
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:12.860
That'll make somebody want to,
uh,
you know,

584
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.150
do some sort of self defense is what they were saying.
And I was just like,

585
00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:21.650
this is fucking crazy out here.
But actually I think that they said that,

586
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:25.280
that that happened up in Charlotte or something like that.

587
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:28.580
I guess the road rage is off the fucking chains in Charlotte,
North Carolina.

588
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.390
That's what I love about a small town.
I never would have heard that.
You know,

589
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.700
it's fucking guy with his white uncle Jesse Beard,
tell his story,

590
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:38.870
brandishing a weapon.

591
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:43.190
And I was just sitting there totally not even given a fuck that I was standing

592
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:44.150
in line at the post office,

593
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:49.160
completely enjoying the story and praying to God that this guy then took out his

594
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:52.850
weapon because I wanted,
I wanted to see where this was going to go next.

595
00:34:52.851 --> 00:34:54.290
But you know,
they didn't say anything like,
Oh,

596
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:58.490
I should've got his license plate and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.
Um,
I dunno.

597
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.180
That's why I stay off the 75 north.
Cause I never would have heard that,
you know,

598
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.710
bite stayed on the 75 north.
I would have heard,
you know,
uh,

599
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.070
can I get the fuck in a,

600
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.760
can I get a double cheeseburger with the bucket global bu I don't wanna hear

601
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:12.200
that shit.
Um,
oh,

602
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:14.390
I know a lot of you guys are expecting me to talk about the Oscars,

603
00:35:14.391 --> 00:35:15.224
but I didn't watch them.

604
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.580
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

605
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.510
<v 1>Okay.
I don't watch award shows unless I'm home.
If I'm home,</v>

606
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.730
then,
uh,

607
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.680
my wife's watching them and then I watch it with her because I like making fun

608
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:31.310
of him while she watches him cause it makes her mad.
She doesn't get mad mad,

609
00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:34.430
but she gets like upset.
But,
uh,
I heard about the,
the big,

610
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:39.000
the big fucking thing there in the end where a Warren Beatty came out and he's

611
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:41.700
like a little wetter for the best picture.

612
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:46.701
2017 goes to Lala land and evidently the poor people from la La land went up.

613
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:51.750
There were two speeches in before they realized that it was actually going to

614
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:56.520
moonlight,
starring Civil Sam Shepard and a Bruce Willis,
I believe.

615
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.480
Um,
I dunno what the fuck happened.

616
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.510
All I know is once I heard that that happened,
I didn't want to watch it.

617
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.410
You know,
I don't like watching people like that level of fucking awkwardness,

618
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.990
you know?
And just seeing Warren Beatty be that fucking old.

619
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.730
And I just realized his last fucking name was what that fucking robot was saying

620
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:21.150
on close and not that close encounters.
What was that?

621
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.600
What does that stupid fucking shit?
Buck Rogers would,

622
00:36:23.601 --> 00:36:25.580
they had that little stupid fucking robot go right?

623
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.970
<v 4>Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi z St Beatty,
baby baby baby.</v>

624
00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.180
<v 1>There was a stupid,</v>

625
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.570
like somebody came up with someone who's sitting in a fucking writer's room and

626
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:38.910
they're like,
all right,
star wars is all the rage.

627
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.880
We got to somehow make money off this.
How are we going to do buck Rogers?

628
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.770
That doesn't seem that bad.
I mean,

629
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:47.700
it was around before star wars and one of the things we got to have like an r

630
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:51.240
two d two and c three Po and the networks like,

631
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:54.960
well we're not fucking iron two actors.
It's going to be too expensive.

632
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:59.580
Combined both characters is stick a fucking midget and that God damn suit,
right?

633
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.400
So I will see three pos,

634
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:04.770
kind of a fucking smart cut with an English accent.

635
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.540
I would just have this thing be a moron.
And you just see it as a catch phrase.

636
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.150
Why not?
What's the catch?
Well,

637
00:37:12.151 --> 00:37:15.330
you fucking come up with it and the writers are probably so pissed.
All right,

638
00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:18.030
let's just come up with the dumbest shit we can possibly say and see what this

639
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:22.170
fucking industry person says.
I ease a little fucking,

640
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.200
he looks like a little kid,
George Washington,

641
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:30.050
but he's painted all silver and he's made out of metal.
And before he talks,

642
00:37:30.051 --> 00:37:33.590
he walks around,
he goes,
Bidi,
Bidi,
Bidi,
Bidi,
you know,

643
00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.050
and then they just sat there and they kept the fucking straight face.

644
00:37:36.051 --> 00:37:39.770
And that's one of those moments in life,
you know,
when you throw it on the table,

645
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.010
you know,
you're looking at that person,
they looking at you.

646
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.390
And it becomes one of those moments where whoever talks first loses and you just

647
00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:51.050
fucking wait it out.
And then the fucking person goes,
ah,
yeah,
go with that.

648
00:37:51.051 --> 00:37:54.210
And they're like,
great,
awesome.
Well let's go do some cocaine.
It's,

649
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:58.640
and it's not fucking addicting,
right?
It's fucking the late seventies.
Um,
yeah,

650
00:37:58.641 --> 00:38:02.060
so I didn't,
I didn't see,
uh,
I didn't see any of it.

651
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.650
Sorry.
I know I got a bunch of tweets.
Can't wait to hear your take on the Oscars.

652
00:38:09.651 --> 00:38:13.760
I did not see it.
What I did see was that the fucking Boston Bruins one again.

653
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

654
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.970
<v 1>One again.
It all my fucking wine and about wine and about,
uh,
you know,</v>

655
00:38:19.971 --> 00:38:24.620
them getting rid of Clo Julian.
Uh,
according to Bob Beers,

656
00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.490
the Bruins are playing much looser and more confident under Bush.
Bruce Cassidy,

657
00:38:28.491 --> 00:38:32.930
sorry,
should I say butch Bruce Cassidy.
Um,
so with the new man on the bench,

658
00:38:32.931 --> 00:38:34.970
the Boston Bruins look like a new team.
The bees are,

659
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.520
and one since Bruce Cassidy took over as interim coach averaging four goals per

660
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:42.850
game while scoring the first and six of those contests,

661
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.480
they exploded for six goals is Sundays matinee went over the stars,

662
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:51.400
but the star suck this year and a 98.5.
The sports hub,

663
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:55.900
Bruins analysts,
Bob Beers says he's seen a much looser and more confident team.

664
00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.980
Uh,
take the ice since Cassidy took over for Khloe.
Julian,

665
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.100
they have a little more leash and a little more freedom to make some plays.

666
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:05.320
Not to the point where they're being reckless or carried away,

667
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:07.150
leaving themselves exposed at the other end,

668
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.900
but they're encouraged to play more offensively.
Um,

669
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.640
I gotta tell you,
man,
they've been playing great,
so I don't know what it is.
So,

670
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:19.810
you know,
I guess I was wrong.
I still think Khloe,

671
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:22.960
Julian's and fucking great coach putting into maybe maybe everybody needed to

672
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:25.360
change.
You know,
maybe that's what it is.

673
00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:28.510
Like you stay with the same person for a while.
He just gets sick of them.

674
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.300
You know,
when this is like the new girlfriend,
you're all excited.

675
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.690
You can go out of the old places,
but it's new for the both of you to go there.

676
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.003
I don't know.

677
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.330
All he knows is fucking working and I absolutely loved,

678
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:46.470
loved the Boston Celtics not making a move before the trade deadline.

679
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.810
I think that was fucking genius.
It was.

680
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:54.520
It would have been so fucking stupid to give up draft picks in some players that

681
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:55.210
we had,

682
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:59.290
you know that they were going to want like Marcus smart in fucking Jae Crowder

683
00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:00.730
and a bunch of draft picks.

684
00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:04.360
At the very least we were going to have to fucking give up that to bring in who?

685
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:09.000
Camella Anthony.
You know
who's,
who's going to,

686
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.010
he's going to tell fucking everybody to clear out and then not get back on d you

687
00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:15.580
don't need that shit and even if he got us past the Cavaliers,
why don't know.

688
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:18.430
You know he's beaten the fucking warriors this year.
We're certainly not.

689
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.770
You give up all of that shit to do.
What?

690
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.060
Common second place instead of fourth.
Who gives a fuck?

691
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.650
Who gives a fuck?
This is the Boston Celtics.

692
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.480
We got to win another championship.

693
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.610
The Lakers Elian about the amount of fucking champions championships they have.

694
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.580
They padded their resume with one.
We need to win another one.

695
00:40:39.581 --> 00:40:42.580
Put a little distance between them and I think this fucking move right there

696
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.990
being patient enough to just say,
no,
we're staying in the God damn course.

697
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:50.290
We got all these draft picks,
you know,
who knows?

698
00:40:50.291 --> 00:40:53.440
Maybe that kid from Duke comes out.
Uh,
Tatum.

699
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.070
Maybe he's one and done.
Who knows?
And you know,
they got that.

700
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:58.930
It was that other kid and some kid on Kansas,

701
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.270
I guess he's like a point guard or something like that.

702
00:41:01.271 --> 00:41:03.760
I don't know what the fuck we need.
I don't know shit about basketball,

703
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.690
but I love not giving it to the stupid pressure that you know you're supposed to

704
00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:12.160
make a move,
you know,
that'll make you better in the short run.

705
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:15.070
But fuck you.
Fuck over all the work you've been doing over the last three,

706
00:41:15.071 --> 00:41:19.870
four years.
So Daddy,
age,
Danny Age.
Love it.

707
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:24.070
Absolutely love it.
All right,
let's do some reads for this week because I'm,

708
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.110
I'm actually going to drive down to Tampa tonight and I'm going to go,
uh,

709
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.590
<v 2>yeah,</v>

710
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:35.590
<v 1>I'm going to go to the fucking Tampa Bay versus the fucking Ottawa senators game</v>

711
00:41:35.721 --> 00:41:38.780
tonight.
But Pam never been to a game there.
We'll see how it is.

712
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:41.510
All right for reads.
All right,
this is what I got here.
Oh,

713
00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:45.170
four reads was the advertising.
It's not for questions.
Let me get rid of that.

714
00:41:45.171 --> 00:41:49.430
Okay.
Boyfriend birthday gift.
Hey there,

715
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:52.370
Billy birthday boy,
my boyfriend,

716
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:58.150
my man recently celebrated a birthday and I contemplated for weeks what I would

717
00:41:58.341 --> 00:41:59.174
get them.

718
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:04.070
You have to listening to many podcasts episodes I picked up on your advice to

719
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:08.450
freshly single men.
Uh,
get yourself all the sports packages.

720
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:13.430
I took old Billy boys advice and bought my guy is subscription for any Chell TV.

721
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:18.260
All these shit.
You're a fucking angel for the remainder of the hockey season.

722
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:22.910
Parentheses go pants.
That's great too.
So he and his and his team is uh,
uh,

723
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.601
a contender,

724
00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:28.400
so it'll be fun to watch and NFL Sunday ticket for the upcoming football season.

725
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.910
He's beyond thrilled.
Of course he is.

726
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.690
Thanks for the laughs and most importantly,
thanks for the birthday suggestion.

727
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.190
All right ladies,
did you hear that?

728
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:43.910
You know what's great about all of that shit is it's so fucking easy to do.

729
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.600
That's the one phone call.
You don't have to go out and go shop.

730
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.470
You don't have to go get something fucking engraved.
It's perfect.

731
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.320
And if anybody wants to outdo this woman,

732
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.860
you know what you do is you get them the perfect chair to sit there and watch,

733
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.080
you know,
and then what you do.

734
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.460
He should get life insurance and as he slowly eats and drinks himself to death

735
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:07.940
watch and all these sports,
you know,
you're going to win either way.

736
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.150
Either he's going to be around and he's going to be this big lovable fucking,

737
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:11.690
you know,

738
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.560
grizzly bear over there watching his games or he's going to fucking die and

739
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:20.390
you're going to get paid.
You know,
there you go.
Good for you.

740
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.290
That's a,
that's a great guy.
I would love that.
I would,

741
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.150
I would be thrilled with that gift.
Alright.
Who versus who?

742
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.970
Ah,
the little Aristocrat fucking conversation here.
Uh,
the actual rule,

743
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.940
I always get these confused and I love that you guys are going to fucking help

744
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:35.301
me out here.

745
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:39.770
Cause I actually use whom the other day somebody told me that when you use who

746
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:43.200
is is,
is if you could substitute it with he or she,
you.

747
00:43:43.201 --> 00:43:47.570
But if you're talking about they are us or a Soliloquy,

748
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.280
then you use home.
I don't know.
Anyways,
he said the actual rule to use who?

749
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.450
With the subject in whom?
Oh,

750
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:59.690
the actual rule is to use who with the subject.
In whom?

751
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.350
With the object.
So it's a subject like a person.

752
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:05.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

753
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.840
<v 1>No I don't.
I'll never get to stop.</v>

754
00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.460
It's like live versus lay.

755
00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.880
The baby on the bed lies down,

756
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:20.230
but when you put the baby on the bed,
the baby is laid down.

757
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:26.620
All right.
How was that supposed to help me?
All right,

758
00:44:26.621 --> 00:44:28.990
let's try and figure out the subject and the object.
Oh my God,

759
00:44:28.991 --> 00:44:31.650
I'm going to start fucking hyperventilating.
This takes me to high school.

760
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.110
They call on you like,
I don't know.
I don't know.

761
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:41.520
Just give me a fucking zero.
Jesus Christ.

762
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.650
How many fucking times you got to call on me.

763
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:46.290
I don't know the answer before you figured out you need to call on somebody
else.

764
00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.290
Quarterback keeps throwing to somebody.
They keep dropping the ball.
They they,

765
00:44:51.291 --> 00:44:55.070
they go to somebody else.
You fucking idiot.
Punt.
All right.

766
00:44:55.071 --> 00:44:59.470
The baby on the bed lies down.
All right,

767
00:44:59.471 --> 00:45:03.370
so the baby is to subject is the bed,
the object.

768
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:08.020
But when you put the baby on the bed,
that's an object.
The baby's laid down.

769
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:09.310
All right.
Well what the fuck?

770
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:10.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

771
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:14.950
<v 1>Who laid the baby down versus Billy boot?</v>

772
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:19.570
Blue balls laid home down.
All right.
I gotta slow down.

773
00:45:19.571 --> 00:45:20.890
Who laid the baby down?

774
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.600
Who laid the baby down?
You did.

775
00:45:25.601 --> 00:45:30.100
You did shoot that poison Arrow through my
shoot.

776
00:45:30.101 --> 00:45:35.080
That poison arrow.
Thank you.
Good night.
Took me back.
I always sing that song,

777
00:45:35.081 --> 00:45:37.330
didn't he?
It and I always say,
whoever sinks that fucking song,

778
00:45:37.331 --> 00:45:40.060
you know that they close with it and then that's how they end that song.

779
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:45.250
That's how they ended.
They go shoot that poison Arrow Dubai.
Ah,

780
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.490
shoot that poison arrow.
Thank you.
Good night.
Yeah,
the surprise ending.

781
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.970
Oh,
I thought you're going to go through my heart again,
but you did.
All right.

782
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:55.260
So who laid the baby down?

783
00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.273
<v 2>All right.</v>

784
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.990
<v 1>Versus Billy balls laid whom down.</v>

785
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.983
<v 2>Okay.</v>

786
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.900
<v 1>Who laid the baby book called?
So if I went like,</v>

787
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:14.800
who drank all this fucking beer?

788
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.870
Billy blue balls was who drank all the beer?

789
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.480
I can't fucking do it.

790
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.890
Who drank all his beard?
How come I can't plug that in.

791
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.090
All right,
well somebody says something about a baby.
I have a baby my life.

792
00:46:37.091 --> 00:46:41.590
So I have a chance.
I can at least get that one right.
Oh,

793
00:46:41.591 --> 00:46:43.480
Jesus sent right back down to the minors.

794
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:44.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

795
00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.110
<v 1>Yeah.
Once again,
he grounds into an inning ending.
Double play.</v>

796
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.150
Fucking kill that goddamn dream.

797
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

798
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:55.800
<v 1>I,
oh,
I don't understand.
I just don't fucking get,
this has been explained to me.</v>

799
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:59.010
50 million.
I never understood how fucking planes flew.

800
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.250
And then I got my pilot's license and they think they were able to fucking

801
00:47:02.251 --> 00:47:07.090
explain it to me.
Who laid the baby down.

802
00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:09.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

803
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.470
<v 1>Versus Billy blue balls laid to whom?
Down.</v>

804
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.323
<v 2>All right,</v>

805
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:23.540
<v 1>so I'm the subject and the first one
and then,
and then what?</v>

806
00:47:23.541 --> 00:47:26.780
The baby becomes an object like are you talking shit about my kid here?

807
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.290
Billy blue balls laid home down.

808
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:36.590
The actual rule is to use who with the subject and who with the object.

809
00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.840
So I'm more important than my kids.
So I'm the object here is that I'm done.

810
00:47:41.841 --> 00:47:46.510
I'm the subject.
But then now that doesn't mean it.
Can you sense?

811
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:49.030
Because it king has subjects and they have to do whatever the fuck they,

812
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.310
he tells him.
I'll tell you right now,
I don't know.

813
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:56.700
I don't feel any closer to to the the finish line than I was Jesus.

814
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.890
The amount of empathy that I have for all the fucking teachers in my life.

815
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

816
00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:05.590
<v 1>That this is the fucking party.
They're trying to mold into something.</v>

817
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:10.670
<v 3>All right?</v>

818
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.600
<v 1>You know what?
It's great for Great Barrier Reef.
For Fuck's sakes,
Bill.</v>

819
00:48:14.601 --> 00:48:16.700
Stop saying the Great Barrier Reef is dying.

820
00:48:16.701 --> 00:48:19.130
Get your pasty white ranger ours down here.

821
00:48:19.131 --> 00:48:22.730
Get in the water and have a look for it.
It's not dying yet.
Is your current,

822
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:26.270
what are you assigned to?
I'm going by what the fucking scientist is saying.

823
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:27.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

824
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.300
<v 1>And I wanted to go fucking nuts,
snorkeling over there.</v>

825
00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.990
Said you better do it now cause I'm not going to let people go there much
longer.

826
00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:32.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

827
00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.800
<v 1>And if you don't know what a ranger is that we are,</v>

828
00:48:34.801 --> 00:48:37.470
C's call redheaded fucks like you.

829
00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

830
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:43.120
<v 1>A range of being short for a rang a tank.
Oh,</v>

831
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:45.160
I get,
isn't that cute?
Well,
you know what?

832
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.130
Maybe you can say that to me next time he come down there and do a fucking show.

833
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:51.070
All right.
Why don't you do that?
I don't give a fuck.
You think I give a fuck?

834
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.440
But what's some con is the bottom of the fucking world with like three quarters

835
00:48:56.441 --> 00:49:01.100
of your goddamn country,
you can't even go to
the tire.

836
00:49:01.101 --> 00:49:04.850
Middle of that fucking content is you continent.
You can't even live there.

837
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.410
What else do you do on Australia Day?

838
00:49:09.411 --> 00:49:12.620
Do you drive around in your poor excuse for a fucking El Camino?

839
00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:19.300
Um,
anyways.
Oh yeah,
he's one of those fucking guys.

840
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.120
Oh,
it's fine.
It's still fucking there.
You know,

841
00:49:22.121 --> 00:49:23.530
I'm going to look this shit up right now.

842
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:24.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

843
00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.520
<v 1>All right.
Great.
Barrier Reef.</v>

844
00:49:26.521 --> 00:49:29.130
Let me see what I get and let me guess because it doesn't agree with you then

845
00:49:29.131 --> 00:49:32.190
it's going to be fake news.
Great Barrier.
Reef dead.

846
00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

847
00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.940
<v 1>Uh,
the Great Barrier Reef is not actually dead.
CNN dramatic.
I've got,</v>

848
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:38.410
what about dying?
Let me see.
Dying.

849
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:39.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

850
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.720
<v 1>Die.
He let me see dying.</v>

851
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:42.910
<v 3>MMM.</v>

852
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.530
<v 1>Corals are dying on the great barrier.</v>

853
00:49:45.531 --> 00:49:48.840
Reef scientists have discovered an unprecedented die off of the,

854
00:49:48.841 --> 00:49:52.070
in the world's largest reef.
The Great Barrier Reef prompt.
Yeah,
there you go.

855
00:49:52.071 --> 00:49:56.480
Right there.
Okay,
great.
Barrier Reef not dying.
Australia insists.

856
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:01.700
Oh,
I get it.
This is your big tourist attraction.
This is your Ferris wheel.

857
00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:05.750
So you want people to keep flying down there so they can jump on the water with

858
00:50:05.751 --> 00:50:07.010
a bunch of great white sharks,

859
00:50:07.011 --> 00:50:10.070
because there's nothing to see on land down there because three quarters of your

860
00:50:10.071 --> 00:50:13.940
fucking countries unlivable and God knows if you go out there,

861
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.360
it's so fucking unlive.

862
00:50:15.361 --> 00:50:18.290
That's why they're snakes and everything down there and so fucking poisons

863
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:22.530
because there's such a lack of food
that a snake,

864
00:50:22.531 --> 00:50:24.240
if it just grazes somebody,

865
00:50:24.241 --> 00:50:26.970
they gotta make it count cause God knows they're not going to see anything

866
00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.970
edible for fucking weeks.

867
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.950
Australia insists that it's not fucking dying.
I love it.
Okay,

868
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:36.530
well that's fucking credible.
That's how you make all your money.

869
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.010
All those fucking con's going down there and this scuba gear because they

870
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:43.310
learned how to hold their breath and breathe underwater and a fucking swimming

871
00:50:43.311 --> 00:50:43.940
pool,

872
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.820
and they've got themselves a little scooper card and now they're going to go

873
00:50:46.821 --> 00:50:50.390
into God's swimming pool.
A fucking ocean.
All right.

874
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:55.310
That's got all this shit that can kill him like God.
That's what it is.
Okay,

875
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:58.440
I get it.
I'm sorry.
I was fucking with the tourist attraction there.

876
00:50:58.441 --> 00:51:02.130
That'd be like you guys down there saying that he can't go up into the arm or

877
00:51:02.131 --> 00:51:04.610
the statue of liberty anymore.
It's going to snap off.

878
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.463
<v 3>MMM,</v>

879
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.990
<v 1>it is.
Diane.
You stupid.
Fuck.
All right.
All right.</v>

880
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.840
Anyways,
I absolutely believe that it is.

881
00:51:14.841 --> 00:51:16.610
Why wouldn't it be all this shit that we're doing?

882
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:21.080
Why would everything else is fucking dying?
Everything else is completely fucked.

883
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.160
But that is,
uh,
maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I'm wrong.
Let me,
you know what?
I actually,

884
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:28.310
I looked it up.
Uh,
let me look up,
not dying.
Let's see what this said.

885
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:32.060
Great Barrier Reef.
But if this is all from fucking Australia,
I'm not buying it.

886
00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:37.360
Great Barrier Reef not in danger can be a big picture of fucking Trump.

887
00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:42.680
Scuba diving.
The Great Barrier Reef.
Not Quote in danger.

888
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:47.710
Tourism and mining groups have welcomed a whatever recommendation that the great

889
00:51:48.441 --> 00:51:53.090
barrier reef be left off the world.
Heritage in danger.
Yeah.
Touring,

890
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:55.520
tourism,
mining these people,
I'll make money off it.

891
00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:57.900
<v 3>Uh,</v>

892
00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:03.030
<v 1>should the Great Barrier Reef be listed as endanger UNESCO.</v>

893
00:52:03.191 --> 00:52:05.800
Great Barrier Reef is not in danger but needs care.

894
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:08.920
You went Asperger experts say great barrier reef.
Yeah.

895
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:11.080
This is all because you're not making money off of it.

896
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:15.600
Great Barrier Reef Outlook.
Poor but not in danger.

897
00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.700
This is like what you guys are doing with the Great Barrier Reef now is what we

898
00:52:20.701 --> 00:52:21.960
do with our food supply.

899
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.823
<v 3>Okay.</v>

900
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:29.840
<v 1>You know,
it's not the best for you,
but it doesn't necessarily cause cancer.</v>

901
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:35.030
Um,
and you know what,
buddy?
I hope you're right.
I hope you're right.

902
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:37.250
I hope it isn't,
but I know God.
Good guide them.

903
00:52:37.251 --> 00:52:38.990
Well that you're not a fucking scientist.

904
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.410
I know I'm not a scientist and I know that scientists say that it is fucking

905
00:52:42.411 --> 00:52:42.741
dying,

906
00:52:42.741 --> 00:52:46.790
but anybody for what I just did my research for 30 seconds was anybody that

907
00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:51.740
makes money off of it,
say it says that it isn't.
So,
I dunno.
Can I,
can you,

908
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.780
if you can write me back with a fucking scientists or some sort of fucking group

909
00:52:56.781 --> 00:53:00.260
of them that don't make money off it or not getting paid to say that it's

910
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:01.094
fucking dying,

911
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:02.810
<v 3>uh,</v>

912
00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:05.480
<v 1>it's not dying then,
then I'll believe it.
Okay.
So what a mom.</v>

913
00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:06.830
I'm still fucking openminded.

914
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.053
<v 3>MMM.</v>

915
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:12.790
<v 1>All right.
Obama News,
censorship.
Uh,
hey,</v>

916
00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:14.920
Mister bill,
um,
Bill Burr.

917
00:53:14.921 --> 00:53:19.921
I have listened to the past couple of podcast where some of your listeners have

918
00:53:20.231 --> 00:53:22.420
messaged in about Obama's.

919
00:53:22.421 --> 00:53:26.490
Suppose it's censoring of news media and a bit of further research.

920
00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:29.580
It seems like they're most likely inaccurate or just wrong.

921
00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.980
Now let me ask you this sir cause I looked it up.

922
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.990
Okay and for what I could tell it was accurate but what I'm guessing is you're

923
00:53:36.991 --> 00:53:39.780
an Obama fan so now you're going to tell me this is fake news.

924
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:44.100
Now you just saw where I was able to look up shit where it said it was dying and

925
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:47.070
then the isn't dying and it's just all what you choose to believe.

926
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:49.980
Right a while the bill is real.

927
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:54.300
The conclusion that it would cause the shutdown in silencing of dissenting

928
00:53:54.301 --> 00:53:56.310
opinions seems incorrect.

929
00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:01.170
It's supposed to find the identity when foreign countries are involved in

930
00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:06.171
spreading propaganda to allow us news sites to know where information is coming

931
00:54:06.211 --> 00:54:10.650
from.
I have a liberal bias and and probably overlooking some things.

932
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.750
Oh there you go.
This guy is an adult.
Okay.
You know what?

933
00:54:12.751 --> 00:54:16.710
I take back everything I said but it seems like that the bill is not nearly as

934
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:18.510
bad as certain sites and making out to be,

935
00:54:18.511 --> 00:54:21.150
which I would agree with cause that that's going to be the Fox News people.

936
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:25.380
Thanks for the podcast and the latest special,
uh,
this is what I would guess,

937
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.440
which is obviously a total guest because I'm a fucking moron.

938
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.280
I'm guessing it's not as bad as people on the right are saying it is,

939
00:54:32.281 --> 00:54:36.690
but I am definitely of the belief that there's always that wiggle room in there

940
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.750
that,
you know,
as they're presenting something,
you know,

941
00:54:39.751 --> 00:54:41.310
that everybody wants to be prevented,

942
00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:44.760
which should be a propaganda from our fucking enemies,

943
00:54:44.761 --> 00:54:46.410
which actually don't even think it's that bad.

944
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.100
I'm not against hearing their take on things.
Um,

945
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.050
but it would also allow them,
it's kind of like,
you know,

946
00:54:54.051 --> 00:54:57.980
after nine 11 where it was just like,
we need to listen,

947
00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.860
we need to be able to listen in on people's phone conversations.

948
00:55:00.861 --> 00:55:04.490
But if you're not doing anything wrong,
you know,
a,
it's then a fucking bomb.

949
00:55:04.491 --> 00:55:04.911
You know,
it's,

950
00:55:04.911 --> 00:55:08.180
this is just for terrorist and then it just becomes a way for them to spy on you

951
00:55:08.181 --> 00:55:09.014
even more.

952
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:12.470
And then years later you see that whole fucking Snowden thing and he's taken
off.

953
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:13.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

954
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.860
<v 1>Basically saying,
I'm not going to help you guys build this thing.</v>

955
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:20.250
The greatest nerd of all time is that snowed guy.
You know,

956
00:55:20.251 --> 00:55:22.580
it was supposed to as other fucking pussy.
So just keep fucking,
you know,

957
00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:24.430
<v 2>okay.</v>

958
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:27.040
<v 1>I've always said it,
you know,
total psychos,</v>

959
00:55:27.041 --> 00:55:32.020
like a complete psycho as no fucking power,
you know,
without nerds,

960
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:35.500
nerds give them the ability to be as cycle on a psycho,

961
00:55:35.501 --> 00:55:36.910
on a fucking global level.

962
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

963
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:38.711
<v 1>Okay.</v>

964
00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:42.910
Is his nuts as Trump is his Dutch is fucking Hillary is Dutch is fucking push.

965
00:55:42.911 --> 00:55:47.310
It's not just all these fucking loaded techs are then that shit without nerds

966
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:50.130
creating the technology for them to,
uh,
you know,

967
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.910
go psycho on a global fucking level.
I mean,

968
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.330
if it wasn't for fucking nerds,

969
00:55:58.210 --> 00:55:58.780
<v 2>yeah,</v>

970
00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.690
<v 1>we'd still be attacking each other with sticks.</v>

971
00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:02.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

972
00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.180
<v 1>You know,
I,
I couldn't figure out how to make a gun.</v>

973
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:12.370
All right.
Lost my 401k.
Hey,
Bill.
Uh,
well,
the cut to the chase,

974
00:56:12.371 --> 00:56:13.510
I'm 51 years old.

975
00:56:13.511 --> 00:56:17.140
Divorced son is in jail for hitting his mother who was a lunatic,

976
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.370
who Jesus Christ.

977
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:23.850
And I received a $49,000 settlement and it blew it all on California lottery.

978
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.650
This can't be real.
I really feel like throwing in the towel.

979
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:33.340
Can you tell me what you would do if you were in my awful shoes?

980
00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.850
All right.
If this is even remotely real.

981
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:39.223
<v 3>MMM.</v>

982
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.950
<v 1>Let's see.
This is probably fake,
but whatever I can,
I can,</v>

983
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:44.230
but other people have completely fucked up their lives.
So I'll,

984
00:56:44.231 --> 00:56:48.370
I'll talk to them.
And You sir,
if you're actually telling the truth,
um,

985
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.570
the biggest thing you got going for yourself is you know that you're a moron and

986
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:53.800
you fucked up your life.

987
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:59.320
So I would sit down and I would look at the decisions that I've made,

988
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.830
figured out why I made those fucking decisions.

989
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.420
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

990
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.420
<v 1>I refuse to believe that you're dumb enough to get $49,000 and spend all of it</v>

991
00:57:09.911 --> 00:57:13.810
on the California lottery.
I would think that some of it went to bear.

992
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.960
Some of them.
It went to Wade.
Come on somebody.
He had 49,000 bucks.

993
00:57:18.961 --> 00:57:20.920
You didn't get yourself a new truck.
Come on,
come on.

994
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:23.953
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

995
00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.040
<v 1>Can you tell me what you would do if you were in my awful shoes?
Uh,</v>

996
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:31.780
I would get a fucking job,
first of all,
I would stay away from um,

997
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.630
<v 2>okay.</v>

998
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.130
<v 1>That stay away from your ex wife.</v>

999
00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:36.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:40.120
<v 1>Your son's in jail for hitting your mother.
So that would mean he's of age.</v>

1001
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.870
Um,
so you're not paying any child support.

1002
00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:45.150
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1003
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:46.620
<v 1>So maybe there's some alimony.</v>

1004
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:49.123
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1005
00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.670
<v 1>I Dunno.
I try to teach my son not to hit my mother.
I mean,
I'm a mother.</v>

1006
00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:58.490
My my not to hit his mother.
I know,
dude,

1007
00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:01.270
you got you.
You got water coming in from all sides here.

1008
00:58:01.271 --> 00:58:02.104
I don't know what to tell you.

1009
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:03.933
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1010
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.100
<v 1>If you get money,
I would save it rather than gamble it away.</v>

1011
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:08.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1012
00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:13.580
<v 1>And uh,
but you're only 51 years old,
dude.
This is what I would do.</v>

1013
00:58:13.581 --> 00:58:14.011
I would start,

1014
00:58:14.011 --> 00:58:18.020
we'd start [inaudible] get a little bit as fucking self esteem and have a little

1015
00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:19.880
more belief in yourself that you can make it,

1016
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.790
other than trying to do a fucking nine zillion to one shot,

1017
00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:29.020
which you tried to cut down to a 49,002 with 49,000 shots at a billion to one.

1018
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:35.650
Um,
yeah,
dude,
I don't know what to tell you,
man.
I think you're going to be fine.

1019
00:58:35.651 --> 00:58:39.490
You 51 years old,
you know,
it's still got,

1020
00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.950
he still got some years ahead of you,
but I would just,
uh,
I,

1021
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:45.700
I wouldn't throw my fucking money away like that.
I mean,

1022
00:58:45.701 --> 00:58:48.670
I don't know how to give you advice if you blew all your money on lottery

1023
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:52.780
tickets.
Uh,
but I don't want you to throw in the towel.
You know what I would do?

1024
00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.860
I would write a fucking book,
steer into it.

1025
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.470
You know,
like either it's the comic's comic.
You might be the losers loser.

1026
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.090
Write a fucking book about it.

1027
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.593
<v 3>You know,</v>

1028
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.560
<v 1>we'll make some youtube videos and just tell your fucking story gets some</v>

1029
00:59:10.561 --> 00:59:15.060
advertising,
right?
Maybe you can make a little bit of money that way.
Shit,

1030
00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.670
it's easy to make 49,000 bucks off the fucking Internet.

1031
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.280
There's enough people that people love,
people failing.

1032
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:23.630
Who Fuck's failed more than you turn it around.

1033
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.620
Turn that failing into a fucking positive.
Tell you fucking story.

1034
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:31.400
Start going around to schools telling people what not to do.

1035
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.420
I don't know what you should do,
but don't do what I did.
Right.

1036
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:37.910
That's a country lyrics.
They always,
they're always doing that shift.

1037
00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:43.960
Like I was thinking on the drive over here talking about this person in front of

1038
00:59:43.961 --> 00:59:45.560
me was driving so slow.
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

1039
00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:47.290
she got all the time in the world and I'm like,

1040
00:59:47.291 --> 00:59:50.050
that's such like a country lyric that they would flip around.

1041
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:52.583
<v 2>You know,</v>

1042
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.270
<v 1>I got all the time in the world and then I don't want to go live.
And you know,</v>

1043
00:59:57.271 --> 00:59:59.370
you say it's a juxtaposition there.
You don't,

1044
00:59:59.371 --> 01:00:02.070
I mean it's like I got all this time my hands,

1045
01:00:02.071 --> 01:00:04.480
but I don't want any time because I'm a mom.

1046
01:00:04.481 --> 01:00:07.260
My woman left me or something like that.
Right.
It's like,

1047
01:00:07.261 --> 01:00:11.820
wait up fucking bull wants to fuck a cow but ain't [inaudible] around but a pig.

1048
01:00:11.821 --> 01:00:14.130
You know what I mean?
It's one of those type of things.

1049
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.540
I would just stare into it sir.

1050
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.250
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1051
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.650
<v 1>I would turn it into entertaining stories is somehow tell them,</v>

1052
01:00:19.651 --> 01:00:22.440
but I'm also a comedian that that's what the fuck I would do.
Other than that,

1053
01:00:22.441 --> 01:00:25.470
I would stay away from your ex wife and um,

1054
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.730
I dunno.
I Dunno what to do with your son.
Try to set a better example

1055
01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:37.120
by not blowing all your money on lottery tickets.
Maybe that's,
that's the thing.

1056
01:00:37.121 --> 01:00:40.330
I don't know.
Sorry.
You were in that situation.
If you actually are all right,

1057
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.510
texts sent to the wrong person at work.
Oh Jesus.

1058
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:49.120
This is never good.
Uh,
dear Billy Graham cracker tits,

1059
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.830
um,

1060
01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.790
I never thought I'd be in a situation where I needed to write in into you like

1061
01:00:54.791 --> 01:00:59.380
this,
but here I am in a pinch.
For the last couple of years,

1062
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:04.750
certain people at my work have been getting very relaxed with their work ethic

1063
01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:05.830
and punctuality.

1064
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.100
So much so that another coworker and I have written an album of songs about its

1065
01:01:11.681 --> 01:01:14.860
absurdity since our office is,
well,

1066
01:01:14.861 --> 01:01:18.220
maybe you can write a song about the guy who just wrote in above me,

1067
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.473
<v 2>you know,</v>

1068
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.770
<v 1>you guys,
you know,
and then he'd go on American idol.
I Dunno.
Anyways,</v>

1069
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:27.440
since ours is an office of about 10 people,

1070
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:32.210
everybody's job directly relates to everyone else's and it puts extra strain on

1071
01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:36.230
the rest of us.
Recently two of the worst offenders,
both ladies,

1072
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.280
not that it matters,
um,
have actually,
but I mentioned it,
uh,

1073
01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:44.540
have actually gotten promotions for some reason.
With that said,

1074
01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:49.541
this morning I noticed one of the ladies accomplished a task in our project

1075
01:01:49.851 --> 01:01:52.570
manager,
uh,

1076
01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.530
to bring food to an office potluck,
lunch

1077
01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.290
being the snarky asshole I am.

1078
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:04.090
I took a screenshot to send to my likeminded coworker with the texts,

1079
01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:09.820
quote,
think,
and then the person's name is going a little overboard here.

1080
01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:12.910
Somehow she only creates to do,
she can get done,

1081
01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:17.350
can't get shit done for work,
but for food,
the bitches all over it.

1082
01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:22.200
When I didn't hear back from after 10 minutes,
I felt this first wave of panic.

1083
01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:26.220
I knew it immediately.
The texts had been sent to the lady.
Yeah.

1084
01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:29.600
Cause what happens is you're thinking about that person and you think thinking

1085
01:02:29.601 --> 01:02:34.320
about their name and Oh my God,
we've all done this completely flustered.

1086
01:02:34.321 --> 01:02:38.130
I sent a flurry of apology text but she didn't respond.

1087
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.800
All this was happening around eight 30 which is when people are supposed to

1088
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:44.634
arrive.

1089
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:49.740
This work are usually shows up around nine 45 or 10 but that's beside the point.

1090
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:54.200
What can you unsend the text?
I Dunno.

1091
01:02:54.201 --> 01:02:57.260
Just some nerd know how to do that.
Anyways,
after I didn't hear from her,

1092
01:02:57.261 --> 01:03:01.760
I checked the calendar and saw that she was on vacation for the next 10 days.

1093
01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:06.260
Oh No.
But I know she got the text and now I'm worried about what she thinks and

1094
01:03:06.261 --> 01:03:09.350
whether it's going to be weird in the office.
What do I do?

1095
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:12.290
She's not a bad person.
And when you called her a bitch too.

1096
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:16.520
And I have to work with her regularly before realizing she was out,

1097
01:03:16.521 --> 01:03:21.110
I already bought flowers and put them on a desk in order to cover the stench of

1098
01:03:21.111 --> 01:03:24.180
my own failure.
Now Dude,
you can't,
he goes,

1099
01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.850
cause she knows what you really think.
I'm guessing I shouldn't leave them there.

1100
01:03:28.851 --> 01:03:32.990
Let her come back to dead flowers either.
Congratulations on your baby girl.

1101
01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.350
And of course you laid a special sincerely.
I done fucked up.

1102
01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.773
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1103
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:46.170
<v 1>Where is she on vacation and is there a way to unsend all of those text
messages?</v>

1104
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:48.810
That's what I would try to do over the next 10 days.

1105
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:50.790
I would not apologize anymore.

1106
01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:54.330
I would not give flowers and this is what you gotta do,
Dude.

1107
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.010
You got to fucking man up and when she calls you out on it,
be like,
Yup,

1108
01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:01.890
I was,
I'm not going to tell you who I was sending it to.

1109
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:05.520
Don't rat out the other person on any fucking level.

1110
01:04:05.521 --> 01:04:08.730
Do not rat out the other person you piece of shit if you do it.

1111
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:12.210
Do not rat them out.
Um,

1112
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.080
I would actually say I was actually sending it to this girl.

1113
01:04:16.081 --> 01:04:19.020
I know who doesn't work here.
Okay.
Just say that.

1114
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:21.343
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1115
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.890
<v 1>And I was bitch to her about people at work and when she calls you out I would</v>

1116
01:04:25.891 --> 01:04:29.310
just say,
listen,
you know what?
They'll send sugarcoating it.

1117
01:04:29.311 --> 01:04:33.040
You're supposed to be here at eight 30 show up at nine 45,
10 o'clock get dog.

1118
01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:36.780
And he is setting a bad example and I like working hard.

1119
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:41.550
And that text came from the frustration of watching you working in setting the

1120
01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:43.500
example of not working up to your potential.

1121
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:47.790
It makes it a bad experience out here.
So that,
that's why I did it.

1122
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:51.550
If you mad at me.
I understand.
But you know I,

1123
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:54.360
I stand by that text message.
I shouldn't have called you a bitch.

1124
01:04:54.361 --> 01:04:57.630
I was just saying that the way,
you know,
Richard Pryor says it.

1125
01:04:57.631 --> 01:04:59.280
I was just trying to be funny.
But you know,

1126
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:05.230
you showing up an hour and 15 to an hour and a half late every day,
it's,

1127
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:08.570
it's not good for the morale around the office.
That's what,

1128
01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:13.540
that's where that came from.
So there you go.
And I'm sorry I sent it to you,

1129
01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:17.950
but you know
that's it.
Fuck it.

1130
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:23.650
<v 2>Fuck it.
That's all.
That's the only card you got to play.
Be like,
yeah,
I sent it.</v>

1131
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.540
Although you did fucking put your hat in your hand and apologize.

1132
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:33.070
Yup.
Boy,
can you please write back and let me know how it pans out.

1133
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:37.300
I'd love to know.
All right.
With that,
that is a podcast for this week.

1134
01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:38.853
MMM.

1135
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:42.340
<v 1>I'll check in on you on Thursday.
And uh,</v>

1136
01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:46.760
this time next week I will be in Phoenix,
Arizona doing two shows a night.

1137
01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:51.670
He had a commodity club also known as a comedy club and uh,

1138
01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.670
be fucking polishing up this fucking hour so I can go on the road,

1139
01:05:55.671 --> 01:05:59.600
not embarrass myself like this guy did with his text message.
You poor bastard.

1140
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.660
We've all been there.
You know what?
Even the lady that you'd,
you're writing too.

1141
01:06:02.661 --> 01:06:06.800
I bet she's done it too.
Uh,
but she's letting you squirm or,

1142
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:12.620
or she's in Aruba or she someplace where she didn't get the text message and

1143
01:06:12.621 --> 01:06:13.670
maybe you cannot do it.

1144
01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:18.140
Maybe you can fucking undo what was already done.
This is,

1145
01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.520
this is another fucking movie.

1146
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.200
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1147
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.920
<v 1>This is a fucking movie.
This is like weekend at Bernie's meets,</v>

1148
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:30.650
uh,
Steve Jobs.
Fucking one of those things when we used to walk out and be like,

1149
01:06:30.651 --> 01:06:35.090
look,
now you can swipe texts and every,
he's like,
oh right.
That's what you do.

1150
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:41.020
If you get fired,
sir,
you should write a fucking script.

1151
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:47.290
Write a fucking script about somebody who sent the wrong text message to their

1152
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:51.580
boss.
Send a text message to the wrong person.
That person's on vacation.

1153
01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:55.330
Okay?
And then eventually you're going to have to fly down there.

1154
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:59.470
You know that you,
you can coast star with the guy with the eyes.

1155
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.680
He always said the ice thing that he got from fucking Al Pachino.
What was,

1156
01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:06.880
what was the name of that actor?
He was in a bout last Andrew McCarthy,
right?

1157
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:10.630
You guys,
maybe you can fucking executive producing.
See that.

1158
01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.210
That's the great thing about entertainment.

1159
01:07:13.211 --> 01:07:15.370
No matter how bad you fuck up and it'll,
it makes,

1160
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.970
the more you fuck up on your personal life,
the more material you get.

1161
01:07:18.971 --> 01:07:22.270
As a comedian and you get a script out of it.
I Dunno.

1162
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:27.100
You don't sound fulfilled.
Maybe.
Maybe you can be a script writer.
All right.

1163
01:07:27.101 --> 01:07:30.700
That's it.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You cunt,
and I'll,
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
