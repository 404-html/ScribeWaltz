Hey,

2
00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:04.380
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.700
Um,
now the gloomy,
gloomy,
rainy,

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
misty day out here in la.
It's been like freezing,
you know,

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.430
glow.
Um,

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
yeah,
that's the tail.
It's just all a,
I dunno,
it's like nine o'clock out here,

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.960
nine o'clock.
It feels like it's a fucking six in the morning over there.

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.100
This is one of these days.
I kind of,

12
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.900
it's a how I going to get anything done second.
It's all cloud.
This son man,

13
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:52.830
it's something in the sun makes you want to get up and do stuff,
man.

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.570
All of a sudden it's a little bit overcast and that your internal clock is like,

15
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:58.231
hey man,
well look,

16
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:01.290
maybe we should just like laid down and like to that tomorrow man.

17
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.380
How anybody gets anything done in Seattle is fucking beyond me or San Francisco

18
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.720
for that matter.
Even though I lucked out with all this great weather.

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.650
When I was up there.
But Jesus Christ,
you must just get used to it.

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.450
You know,
if you're successful in like Seattle,

21
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:25.030
you've gotta be able to be successful anywhere.
Right.
Um,

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.050
I was speaking to that shit.
I was watching this thing on the 90s,

23
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.770
right after my [inaudible] was watching.
Uh,

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
she's watching the royal wedding.
I came back from San Francisco,
by the way,

25
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:42.570
thank you to everybody who,
uh,
came out.
That was an incredible week.

26
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
I had such a great time up there and,
uh,

27
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.840
I drank too much.

28
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:53.130
So now I'm back back on the food and the booze wagon.

29
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.450
I'm on the elliptical,
turning it all around.

30
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.170
I'm on the road,
Billy booze bag at home.
Fucking father O'Malley.

31
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.840
Well,
that's probably not a good thing to say.
Huh?
Catholic priest.
Hoy.

32
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.740
He can't tie teachable.
Um,
what am I trying to say?
So I come back,
you know,

33
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.960
I'm all excited to see my wife and kid and I come home and,
uh,

34
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.860
she's watching that royal wedding,
which was literally the whole fucking wedding.

35
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.650
Oh my God.
I felt so bad for that.

36
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.330
The fucking guy,
whoever.
What is it,
Harry?

37
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.360
He can't just get married.
It's got to be all of that.
You know,

38
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.910
everybody all dressed up in these crazy hats and shit.

39
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.530
It was like the fucking Kentucky Derby met meets like medieval manner.

40
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.320
They was missing was Jim Carey's character in that cable guy,

41
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.860
movie doubt downtown bed going down.

42
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:00.590
When was they were there at that fucking,

43
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.720
you don't want a theme restaurant there?
Um,
what up?

44
00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:09.590
I'm happy for balls at that they filed love for their together.
Jesus Christ.

45
00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:14.360
So she watched the whole God damn thing and uh,
so she's upstairs.
So I was like,

46
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.170
okay,
I'm going to go on pack downstairs.
We've got a TV downstairs.

47
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.560
I go downstairs and uh,
and the processes,

48
00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:26.290
me unpacking,
she came downstairs cause she wanted to hang out with me and,

49
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.700
and she turned on the fucking the wedding down there

50
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.710
and I believe I yelled into a thick bathrobe.

51
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.590
I would just like [inaudible]
why didn't you say,

52
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.770
I said,
it's great to be back with you in May.

53
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.070
So I walked in there and,
uh,
I just was like,

54
00:03:50.071 --> 00:03:54.510
I know I'll just slowly walk out of the room and I got all the way out of the

55
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:57.090
room and closed the door to within two inches since she was like,

56
00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.720
where are you going?
Psych,

57
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.930
I'm going to go upstairs.
She's like,

58
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:06.690
why I wanted to hang out with you.
It's like,
all right,
well,

59
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.910
I can't watch this.
She goes,
it's almost over.

60
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.860
So I went upstairs and,
you know,
I don't know.

61
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.670
I get her watching that,
that,
that would be like,
but that would,

62
00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:24.270
that the royal wedding would be like me trying to get her to watch.
Um,

63
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.861
I dunno.

64
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:30.510
Some Hall of fame induction ceremony after she's been away for five days,

65
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.460
you know?
Um,
oh,
I had a hilarious thing after me.

66
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:37.890
I put on us in San Francisco,
right.
So I'm eating like an asshole.

67
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:40.680
I went to this Vietnamese restaurant.
I never eat Vietnamese food.

68
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.620
I don't know why.
I'm a creature of habit.

69
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:48.621
I will eat Sushi and Ali like Chinese food and I'll eat Indian food.

70
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.470
Oh,
I'll dance all around that continent.

71
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:57.320
But for some reason like Vietnamese food,
you know,

72
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.220
I'm like I don't know about that.
I Dunno.

73
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.810
<v 0>Thai food I had a long time ago and I got food poisoning off it so I wouldn't,</v>

75
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.060
I can't even for like 10 years.

76
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:12.940
And then also I always get the same fucking thing cause the,
the,
the,

77
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.400
the menu is just overwhelming cause I don't know what anything is and I don't

78
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:20.040
want to make a mistake so I always get the,
uh,

79
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.520
what the fuck is it called?
I don't know.
Nia knows what it is.
And she goes,

80
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:27.600
you're going to get this thing again.

81
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:31.680
And every time I get Sushi get the exact same Sushi,
spicy,

82
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:35.790
yellow tail hand roll of something else.
Set up salmon,
avocado,

83
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.980
some edamame.
Me.
Right.
You get the same thing every time.
I know,
I know.
I do.

84
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.810
I realize that I got these things,
they work for me.

85
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.800
I'm afraid to venture into other parts of the menu.
You got me.
All right.

86
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.340
So I'd never had Vietnamese food so I was like that.
The whole thing was like,

87
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.470
like what is it?
Like,
what are they going to,

88
00:05:58.471 --> 00:06:03.030
it's always the same shit,
beef,
chicken and pork and just how they dress it up.

89
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.650
So I'm like,
all right.
So I went in there,

90
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.000
I got this chicken sandwich and I saw these shredded carrots on top of that.

91
00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.560
I was like,
oh my God,
that's going to be gross.

92
00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:14.370
And I ate it and it was fucking delicious.
So anyways,
but you know,

93
00:06:14.371 --> 00:06:18.270
the chicken was kind of fried.
I told Jade Bat,
oh eight bed and um,

94
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.760
<v 2>yeah,</v>

95
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.580
<v 0>so now I got the salt going through my veins and uh,</v>

96
00:06:23.581 --> 00:06:27.060
up the street there was an ice cream place.
So,
so this is all off the rails.

97
00:06:27.061 --> 00:06:29.430
I was in my diet was like,
I'm going to go up to the ice cream place,

98
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.290
so fucking walk in there

99
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.450
and it's one of these new agey ice cream,
uh,
artisan ice cream,

100
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:40.630
whatever the fuck that means.
All I know is when it says artisan,

101
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.150
if you're an old guy like me,
you're not going to recognize any of the flavor.

102
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.560
Flavor's they had like some,
like I was just looking for chocolate,
vanilla,

103
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:50.650
strawberry.
The old school shit,
they don't have any of that.

104
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.180
I think I like potato chips in it and shit.
They got one was like chocolate,

105
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.770
a chocolate rose leaf or something.
If anybody can tell me what the fuck that is,

106
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.690
so I just looked at it.
I was just like,
what the fuck is this?

107
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.550
I wasn't there an ice cream store around the corner and when I'll go to that
one,

108
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.540
maybe that's an old school one and I walked into that one.
Same Shit.

109
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:15.170
They had six flavors.
I couldn't,
I couldn't remember any of them today if you,

110
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:18.580
if you had a gun to my head.
So I say to the lady,

111
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:23.500
I just go a eight d,
She got mint chocolate chip.
She goes,
no,

112
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:27.820
it's not in season.
I was like,
wait,
you mean it's not in season?

113
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.090
And she turns around.
She's like mag waste once mid check,

114
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:36.340
a chip can be a season in late kids up.
She's like,
I think July.

115
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.580
How fucking ridiculous in season.

116
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.140
<v 0>It's like you're serving ice cream.
This leads to diabetes.
This is poison.</v>

118
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.540
Your body doesn't need this.

119
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.320
There's a lot of studies out there right now that it's saying sugar is a

120
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:56.720
carcinogen.
You know,

121
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.910
that's just what the fuck you're serving people.
Well,
but it's fresh.

122
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.040
This is in season cancer,
right?
So you know what I did?

123
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:10.440
I was like,
fuck this.
I just walk out.
I just said,
okay,
thank you.

124
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:13.350
And I walk out right?
Can you know what I did?

125
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.000
I just went to the same place that old people get their ice cream.

126
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.900
I went to Walgreens,
I went to a pharmacy right now,

127
00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:25.380
all you gotta do is find wherever the photo mat developing places,

128
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.150
and you see about eight old people there with like Insta,
Insta,
fucking cameras,

129
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:31.530
whatever the hell those things used to be.

130
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.920
And right to the left of it or to the right of it will be ice cream.

131
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.910
And I went there and I walked right in.
I saw Haga does mint chocolate chip.

132
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.600
I bought a whole fucking pint.
I didn't want it.
You know,

133
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.760
I just wanted a small cups.
I bought the whole pint.

134
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:48.300
That was so fucking tempted to walk back to that ice cream store.
I'd be like,

135
00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:50.790
hey ladies,
it said,
say said,

136
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.183
but I didn't.

137
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.670
And then I went back to the hotel room and even though I was good after reading

138
00:09:00.671 --> 00:09:03.790
like a third of it,
like I didn't have a ref a freezer or anything,

139
00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:07.180
it was going to go bad.
And My mother taught me not to waste.

140
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:08.890
So I plowed through the whole thing,

141
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.860
ate a pint of ice cream in like the middle of the day.

142
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.250
And my body was just like in,
all right dude,
this is what we're doing.
And I,

143
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:20.080
I couldn't get out of bed for like the next fucking three hours.

144
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.580
Sugar went through the fucking roof.
My unnatural sugar.
Evidently when,
what,

145
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:29.260
what season is sugar and what,

146
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.580
see when his sugar in seasons is what I should ask.
Um,

147
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.560
so there you go.
All right.
If you're old and you need ice cream,

148
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.550
you want some ice cream.

149
00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:44.551
At this point I would suggest going to the grocery store or going to a pharmacy

150
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.060
drug store.
They have the old school.

151
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:50.770
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

152
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:55.130
<v 0>Chocolate,
vanilla,
strawberry,
mint,
chocolate chip,
butter Pecan,</v>

153
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.380
all those old ones.
Okay.
And I don't want to be a fucking asshole old guy,

154
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:04.120
so I respect the young people in their new crazy flavors,
you know,

155
00:10:04.121 --> 00:10:06.760
where these take other desserts and they stick it in there.

156
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.243
<v 3>Okay.</v>

157
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.660
<v 0>You know,
candy bars and brownies and shit.
It's just like,
it's fucking redundant.</v>

158
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.790
Um,
although I will smoke a cigar during some smokey Scotch,
so I dunno.

159
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.180
I Dunno what,
anyways,
I can say that was my,
I uh,
you know,

160
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.670
what's the deal with ice cream?
Soda Story.

161
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.310
Uh,
speaking of ice,

162
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.390
because I become friends with Josh,
Adam mayase,

163
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.020
the host of the goddamn comedy jam.
He's a good friend of mine.

164
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:41.840
He somehow has me rooting for the fucking Washington capitals,
you know,

165
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.650
every year in the playoffs.
Right.
Obviously if the plane,
my Bruins,
I don't,
okay.

166
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.160
But you know,
so he can,
you know,
feel what it's like to win a championship,

167
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.950
so can put a little sparkle in his eye.
And now he has me watching these,

168
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.580
this fucking team every year.
And I was sitting by myself yesterday.

169
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:00.990
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

170
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.260
<v 0>You know,
if you haven't paid attention to the series,
the lightning,
uh,</v>

171
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.260
lost the first two games.
Capital's one the first two games.

172
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.900
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

173
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.880
<v 0>And my buddy was all excited and I said,
hey,</v>

174
00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:13.040
I don't want to be the guide raining on your parade,
but,
uh,

175
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:15.800
we beat him pretty easily in game one.
And then they,

176
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.240
they just shut us down and ran the fucking table.
So,
uh,

177
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.570
I think I'd wait till I was at least up three games to none before I got excited

178
00:11:23.571 --> 00:11:26.240
about beating the lightning.
Right.

179
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.520
So they won the first two games the capitalists did.

180
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.720
Then the lightning won game three.
They want game four.

181
00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:36.980
And yesterday I'm sitting down watching game five,
um,

182
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.290
watching this adopted team that's going to break your heart every year.

183
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:44.870
And I was by myself and I literally said to the TV,

184
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.750
you don't have to lightening score to yet another goal.
I just,

185
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.080
I just say he fucking capital's,
it'd be God damn fucking year.

186
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.970
And it was just like,
what am I,

187
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.080
this support and a friend?
And then there's just,
you know,

188
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.840
standing in line for an ass kicking for no goddamn reason itself.
Um,

189
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.000
and how bout those Vegas Nights?
Jesus Christ.

190
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

191
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.630
<v 0>Making short worth or the Winnipeg jets.
What have they got on that team?</v>

192
00:12:14.631 --> 00:12:18.050
I know they get the flour from Pittsburgh between the pipes.

193
00:12:18.051 --> 00:12:19.970
I guess he's playing fucking unbelievable.

194
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.080
They've got a bunch of old wily veterans coming together.

195
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.030
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

196
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.160
<v 0>I dunno.
I,
every time I pictured that team,
it's like,</v>

197
00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:33.080
it's like an over 35 we gain,
you know,
within the NHL,

198
00:12:33.081 --> 00:12:36.670
but a good for that man.
Um,

199
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.370
it's going to be funny.
You know,
the first year they don't make the finals.

200
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.430
How their fans are gonna react to that.

201
00:12:43.431 --> 00:12:46.330
They're going to be so goddamn spoiled in the history of,
of,

202
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.910
of the four major sports.
Has this ever happened?

203
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.650
Has An expansion team in their first year ever?
I could look this up.

204
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.680
Ever made it to like the equivalent of the Superbowl world series type of shit.

205
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:06.420
Okay.
Has an expansion team

206
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.330
ever made the finals.
Okay.
Then they going to say,
well,

207
00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:14.340
the Vegas Knights did it yesterday.
Yeah.

208
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

209
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.200
<v 0>All right.
Vegas become the first expansion team to reach a championship.
Yep.</v>

210
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.750
There you go.
Has an expansion team ever won a championship?
Well,

211
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:25.320
if no one's ever made the championship game,
that would be a no.

212
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.390
All right.
Is he article expansion teams not supposed to be good,

213
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.490
especially in their first year.
The fact that these clubs have to draft players,

214
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.050
what the fuck was that?
I thought there was a whole sliding off the counter.

215
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.990
Um,
the fact that these clubs was that earthquake just in my kitchen.

216
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.860
The fact that these clubs have to draft players who often aren't important

217
00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:52.140
enough to their current teams to be projected,

218
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.900
although that's not necessarily always the case,

219
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.680
provides expansion teams with a significant disadvantage in their inaugural

220
00:13:58.681 --> 00:14:03.420
seasons season.
This,
however,
the Vegas goal this year,
however,

221
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:07.650
the Golden Knights have dispelled that notion on their way to a Stanley Cup

222
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:11.310
final appearance.
Oh,
this is the big thing.

223
00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:16.020
Every year is to Stanley Cup final and it's the NBA finals.

224
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

225
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.420
<v 0>It's all how you look at.</v>

226
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.230
If you look at all seven games collectively as the final or if you look at each

227
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.690
game,
this is,
this is an NBA final game.

228
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.130
This is game one of the NBA.
I don't know.

229
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.600
I think the way the hockey does it makes a little more sense.
Um,

230
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.350
how does Vegas stack up against the other expansion teams?
All right,

231
00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:41.380
here we go in the ain't shelled.

232
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:46.381
The Golden Knights are just a second team since 1952 appear in the final and its

233
00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:51.520
inaugural season joining the St Louis Blues in 1968 that out.

234
00:14:51.521 --> 00:14:55.210
But that's bullshit though.
I'm a,
before I even read the next sentence,

235
00:14:55.211 --> 00:14:57.700
cause I remember,
you know what they did and the NHL.
Okay.

236
00:14:57.701 --> 00:15:01.990
The one from six teams to 12 teams and rather than putting three with the three

237
00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:04.900
original and one conference in three with the three originally,
others,

238
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.120
they have the entire expansion six in their own conference.

239
00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:13.660
So from day one one of them was going to make it there and then get fucking

240
00:15:13.661 --> 00:15:17.470
swept by,
uh,
one of the original six.
Right.

241
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.140
Uh,
what does it say?
However,

242
00:15:20.141 --> 00:15:23.590
the blues were one of six expansion teams that year and all six of them were

243
00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:28.300
placed in the same division,
the winter,
which advanced to the final.
There you go.

244
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.120
<v 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.400
<v 0>An mls to Chicago fire shock.</v>

246
00:15:32.401 --> 00:15:37.401
The world world world in 1998 by winning the MLS Cup and US Open Cup in their

247
00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:41.430
first season,
I would say they shot the fucking,

248
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.420
the United States soccer world.
I wouldn't say the shock the world,

249
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.970
but the rest of the world does watch soccer or as they call it,
football.

250
00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:55.170
But I don't think they respect our bullshit right.
By made us look worse.
Right.

251
00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:01.020
But in the major in Major League baseball nor expansion club has finished with

252
00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:04.680
more than 70 wins in its first seasons season in the NBA.

253
00:16:04.681 --> 00:16:07.590
This 1916 Chicago Bulls are the most successful,

254
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:13.800
successful expansion team.
Jesus Christ.
But only one 33 games.
And in the NFL,

255
00:16:13.801 --> 00:16:18.270
the 1995 Carolina Panthers who finished just seven and nine,

256
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.000
top the list.
Well,
there you go.

257
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.530
There you go,
man.
Um,

258
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.780
after disappointed career at Tampa,
Brett Connolly redeemed himself as a capitol.

259
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.580
It's like there's that next capital game tonight.
Is that what you're telling me?

260
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.420
Yeah,
it's three games to two,
8:00 PM eastern time.

261
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.170
How in the Boston Celtics,
Jesus Christ a series is so fucking long.

262
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.050
They played the first two games and there was like a nine day layoff,

263
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.250
which I think helped all,
uh,
Cleveland.

264
00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:01.060
I would say a bunch of my buddies were all excited.
Like,
dude,

265
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.610
I think the shelter should get a win in fucking five.

266
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.970
They're going to sweep them.
And I'm just like,
uh,

267
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.560
I dunno.
I was just like,
they,
they need to win game three

268
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.860
because if they lose game three,

269
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:18.610
then it's two to one and then all of a sudden Cleveland can tie it up.

270
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.520
And that's the plastinated thing about a seven game series.

271
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:23.260
Like if you're three games to one you like,
don't,

272
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:26.650
we're in the driver's seat the second you lose game five.

273
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

274
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.460
<v 0>The rest of the series six and seven,
the pressure's on.
You can,
you can,</v>

275
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:37.900
can they close them out?
Can they fucking close them out?
So,
uh,

276
00:17:37.901 --> 00:17:40.960
I was joking with a buddy of mine who was a cavalier fan and you say,
you know,

277
00:17:40.961 --> 00:17:43.900
before game three saying,
you guys look great.
And I said,

278
00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:47.230
I won't be comfortable to,
we get that fourth win against you guys.
Um,

279
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.083
uh,

280
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.540
once again you saw what made Lebron fucking so great because he did in that game

281
00:17:57.051 --> 00:17:59.870
what a lot of people with half his skill won't do,

282
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:04.640
which is past the fucking ball.
And he got all these fucking teammates involved,

283
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.050
um,
in,
anybody can draw that up on paper,

284
00:18:09.051 --> 00:18:13.310
but this guy actually goes out and does it.
And um,

285
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.360
you know,
so now we got the great Brad Stevens.

286
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.760
He's got to figure out a way

287
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.000
to come up with some sort of defensive,
uh,
if that's what Lebron is going to do.

288
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.990
But uh,
this series is far from Ovi the way,

289
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.730
and I'm going to die another thousand deaths tonight.
Watching the Goddamn game

290
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.890
drives me fucking nuts,
man.
It drives me nuts.

291
00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:42.620
Sometimes he ever get like jealous is somebody like as much as like the

292
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.640
Cleveland sports fans,

293
00:18:43.641 --> 00:18:46.940
like the Cleveland browns fans like Bitch Moan and complain

294
00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.430
about never winning a Superbowl or anything like that.
It's just like,
you know,

295
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.310
there's no surprise that you're not aging.
Watching them sucky.
Dislike.

296
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.390
Yeah,
they fucking suck.
Blah Blah bloods.
It's over.
It's hopeless.

297
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.430
But if you have a team that makes the playoffs,

298
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.540
they give you hope and you fucking book every,

299
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.680
every time they get to you fucking believe it.
And he'd get all excited.

300
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.910
As much as the Celtics people would say,
you have tremendously overachieved.

301
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.300
If they lose this series,
it's going to be devastating.

302
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.160
And I always get to,
as I've gotten older,
I always just think to myself,

303
00:19:25.161 --> 00:19:29.220
why do I give a shit?
Why do I give you shit like that?

304
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:31.340
The stuff I have to do when the game is on,

305
00:19:31.341 --> 00:19:34.760
like where I have to go mentally so I could just handle sitting there like I

306
00:19:34.761 --> 00:19:37.730
don't get how people can just fucking sit there and watch it.

307
00:19:37.731 --> 00:19:40.700
I have to go into the other room,
you know,

308
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.140
I've got to start paying bills and stuff while I'm watching the I to have

309
00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:49.520
another activity.
So I'm just not sitting there watching the fucking game,

310
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.790
losing my mind.
Um,
but anyways,

311
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:56.743
you know,

312
00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:02.120
as much as that we got our asses Hawaii up and gained three,
uh,

313
00:20:02.121 --> 00:20:02.950
you know,

314
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.010
you can't get mad at greatness and that's what I think you saw with the broad.

315
00:20:07.011 --> 00:20:10.070
So who else?
Celtics,
obviously if they went the night,

316
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.110
we'd be up three games to one was yeah,

317
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.920
we shall see what happens.
Um,
and I'm going to watch my,

318
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.320
my surrogate fucking capital's tonight.
We'll see what happens.
Well,
no,
wait,

319
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:28.750
I'm going to watch the Celtics and I'll be flipping back and forth.

320
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.040
Fucking lightening,
man.
They just give you the old right?
They have it.

321
00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.930
What they score is 17 seconds into that game.
Hey,
you go Bam.

322
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.500
Fucking knock a goalie right out of the game before you even get your goddamn

323
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.830
first beer.
They got a bunch of snipers.
Um,

324
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.760
all right,
let me read a little bit of a advertisement

325
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.890
for,
for this week.
Um,
anyways,

326
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:00.371
but this is my,

327
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:04.360
this is my last big push here is I s I slide into my fucking 50th birthday here

328
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.860
where,
um,
you know,

329
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:11.380
I got myself a great shape,
but I think I peaked too early.

330
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.660
Then I had that bad week in San Francisco.

331
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:15.730
So now we got to have a perfect week just to,

332
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:20.230
just to get even with what the fuck I did last week and uh,

333
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.940
but I think I'll be all right.
You know,

334
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.050
come in right around one 70 a look.
All right.

335
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:27.863
You know?

336
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:28.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

337
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.500
<v 0>At least when I cry when my forties are over and I looked down at my stomach,</v>

338
00:21:32.501 --> 00:21:37.240
it won't be as big and that'll be uplifted.
Does that make sense?

339
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.980
I fucking know.
Right?
Zip Brooke.

340
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

341

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.770

Doo Doo Doo Doo for freckles,

368
00:23:24.481 --> 00:23:28.200
for freckles.
I'm actually seriously considering getting rid of my bar.

369
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.980
Can you put like half drank?

370
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:35.763
<v 2>Fuck is that</v>

371
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:47.950
<v 0>sounds like the beginning of like a movie ripping off a said Eddie Murphy Movie</v>

372
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:52.140
Axel Foley.
But do boom,
boom,
boom.

373
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.180
What do you think was playing other than the original porn?

374
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.620
It's actually a highlight for the Vegas Knights.

375
00:24:01.621 --> 00:24:04.710
Vegas will be the play the winner of the capital series.

376
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.080
<v 4>Okay,</v>

377
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.400
<v 0>so that's on the sports illustrated if you'd like to have that as a ring,</v>

378
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:14.100
but do Doodoo boop,
boop.
Um,

379
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.690
let's see what this one sounds like.

380
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.890
Oh,
this is the old guy chasing a woman to the train.
I saw this woman,

381
00:24:23.891 --> 00:24:27.790
she was beautiful.
She was beautiful.
I had to talk to her.

382
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.120
Well,
you could do that and fucking real life.

383
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.300
See some woman on a platform and then start running towards her train.

384
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.133
You know,

385
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.090
how do you not come off as a creep peaky Gig?

386
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.650
You can't even be walking briskly.

387
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.600
I would think of that alone would freak a woman up.
Like,

388
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.030
what the fuck is this guy doing it?

389
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.500
You don't ever want a stranger walking briskly towards you.

390
00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.220
Um,
anyways,
that,
I mean,
that's just my opinion.

391
00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.150
It's just my opinion.
People.
That's all this fucking podcast is.

392
00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:12.151
It's just my opinion over and over and over again for 60 God damn minutes.

393
00:25:13.001 --> 00:25:17.410
And you just got to sit there and take it.
Oh,
you shut it off.
You know,

394
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.430
that's always an option.

395
00:25:18.431 --> 00:25:23.050
You could do that instead of sitting there playing the victim,
you know,

396
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.570
and writing a blog about it.

397
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:32.150
I was so mentally abused by the Monday morning podcast,

398
00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:36.370
I couldn't reach up and hit stop.
MMM.

399
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:40.260
All right.
So I've been downloading a bunch of fucking,

400
00:25:40.261 --> 00:25:44.740
like late seventies and early eighties as such.
Talk a music here.
Um,

401
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.790
I was watching something,
uh,
what's his face there?

402
00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:55.680
That the lead singer of he was in black fat flag.
Oops.

403
00:25:55.681 --> 00:26:00.420
Jesus Christ didn't need to say that
black flag.

404
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.990
The fuck is his name.
Um,

405
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.370
he had a band.
He had a band named after him.

406
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.380
Oh Jesus Christ in my brain is so fucking fried.

407
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.710
I keep thinking Bronson like Mark Ronson.
I know it's not that,

408
00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:22.410
but the fuck is this guy,
Dan.
All right.
And I could look this shit up.

409
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.580
Don't fucking laugh at me cause I know,
I know.

410
00:26:26.581 --> 00:26:27.780
I'm not the only one who does this shit.

411
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.890
Black flag lead singer.

412
00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.310
This is why I can never be on jeopardy because even though when I know the

413
00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:36.450
fucking answers,

414
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.520
<v 4>okay,</v>

415
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.960
<v 0>he won't,
I know the God damn answers Henry Rollins,
Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

416
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.580
So I saw this thing,
Henry Rollins,
right?
And he was recommending these albums.

417
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.050
Some of them I had,
some of them I didn't.
And uh,

418
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.190
so he recommended this band joy division and it's like,
all right,

419
00:26:57.191 --> 00:26:59.440
I've heard of this band for fucking ever.

420
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.560
I never took the time to get into them or any of that shit.

421
00:27:05.561 --> 00:27:08.810
If this guy is saying this is the real shit.
Um,

422
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.550
and he was saying their original album is as good as anything the rolling stones

423
00:27:12.551 --> 00:27:13.900
ever did and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

424
00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:18.901
So I went out how in a right to iTunes and promptly downloaded their second

425
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:23.560
album by accident.
I got to tell you,

426
00:27:23.561 --> 00:27:27.940
I love it.
So I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go back kind of

427
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.510
fucked up because I should have done it chronologically and seen the growth even

428
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:35.490
though they went around that long.
Cause,
unfortunately,

429
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:40.110
the lead singer committed suicide,
uh,
barely 24 years old,

430
00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:41.010
but Jesus Christ,

431
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.180
there was some fucking unbelievable bands that came out of Manchester in,

432
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.930
uh,
the late seventies and early eighties.

433
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:52.170
That was so god damn different from everything else that was going on.

434
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:55.320
Considering that first album that I haven't listened to yet,

435
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:57.000
if it sounds anything like the second album,

436
00:27:57.001 --> 00:28:01.350
which came out in [inaudible] 79 to listen to that music and know that like

437
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:04.460
popular music was like at the time was like,
I love that.

438
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.130
<v 5>I got to a bull gay honor this girl.
Right.</v>

439
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.940
<v 0>Yay.
Right.
I won't to pull down my,
my,
my,
my,</v>

440
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.820
my boogie shoes.
Ban It and know,

441
00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.450
hey fucking lady,
let's go create some herpes.

442
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.150
Bane.
That's what all the sons were.

443
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.190
We're going to stop fucking until you can die from this shit.

444
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.860
Go to bed.
Um,

445
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.820
Carmona now coco cocaine's not addictive brain.

446
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.560
All right,
sorry.
Um,
anyways,
but you know what's so funny,

447
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:47.680
I liked disco music too.

448
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.050
I like to shit because I was too young to know that it evidently everybody

449
00:28:52.051 --> 00:28:55.260
fucking hated it.
And when I hear that Shit,
you know,

450
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.490
a Buddha pit bull,
that bull with it.

451
00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.350
<v 5>Just,
just Paul,
you get it.
No,</v>

452
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.820
<v 0>I just pictured myself riding my bicycle up to the store to buy some football</v>

453
00:29:07.821 --> 00:29:11.540
cards or baseball cards.
All right.
I didn't know any better.

454
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.030
I didn't realize that that was the music of

455
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.000
<v 5>man,
man.</v>

456
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.110
<v 0>I had no idea.
Wow.
See,
hey,</v>

457
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:24.600
I taught all of that shit was like a thought that was legit.

458
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:31.280
No idea.
Anyways,
check out joy division.
Download their first album,

459
00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.450
like can be wrong and said,

460
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.430
don't fucking accidentally downloads the second one and then defend disco like I

461
00:29:37.431 --> 00:29:40.100
just did on my podcast.
Okay.

462
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.210
You don't have to.
So I was listening to that and then I was listening to,

463
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.770
uh,
that led me to remember Romeo void.

464
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.570
Never say never.
I never knew what the woman,
uh,

465
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.380
look like or anybody in the band.
One of the coolest looking at bench,

466
00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.170
you're ever going to see it now once again,
way ahead of their fucking time

467
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.590
video for never say never.
It's cool.
It's like a fucking movie.

468
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.190
And I,
I know I used to watch MTV all the time.

469
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:15.220
I barely remember them ever play in this.
Uh,

470
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:18.970
but I would say Romeo void and a joy division,
both of them,

471
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.110
me listening to them really sitting down listening to that shit for the first

472
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:26.170
time in 2018.

473
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.850
And the music still holds up.
It doesn't feel like,
you know,
uh,

474
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.420
what are some of the popular shit?
I'll fight Dowell.
Dad

475
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.860
Won't go to a junk car.
That's not a bad song either.
Right.
I,
you know,

476
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.070
something you can't,

477
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:47.071
you can't objectively look at any music that was out when you were growing up.

478
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:48.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

479
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.710
<v 0>You know what I mean?
Because there was like,
Oh man,
I'm in with his song came on.</v>

480
00:30:51.711 --> 00:30:53.690
That's the,
uh,
first time I got,

481
00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.040
<v 2>yeah.</v>

482
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.910
<v 0>Hung on a door,
not by my underwear,
by the [inaudible].</v>

483
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.740
You got all these skew,
all these great childhood fucking memories.

484
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.310
I remember that,
that set time,
that fucking

485
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:11.600
teacher locked me in the closet because he had to go do something.

486
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:16.210
He didn't have time to like fucking,
you know,
watch me during detention.

487
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.883
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

488
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.360
<v 0>I remember that.
I remember that day.
That was a day that fucking,</v>

489
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.590
I don't want to get knowledge all that shit anyways,

490
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.340
check them out if you get a chance.
I guess that was the point of all that.

491
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.710
The point of all that
was to check the,

492
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.240
check those people up if he,
if,
if you have,

493
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.120
if you have time,
um,
if you don't,
I understand.

494
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.800
Just keep listening to the shit you listen to.
You know,

495
00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.270
I kind of noticed that when,
uh,

496
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:49.080
when I went to that giant Bob Baseball game last week,

497
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.710
like there was a couple of guys that came to the plate and they would just

498
00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:53.544
listen to this,

499
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.690
remember that new metal in some of that horrific shit that came out in the early

500
00:31:57.691 --> 00:32:02.490
two thousands,
you know,
when they tried to combine wrap and metal,

501
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.113
<v 2>you know,</v>

502
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:06.570
<v 0>and it's,</v>

503
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.120
everybody would be up there playing instruments and then that'd be that one

504
00:32:09.121 --> 00:32:12.750
white kid running around.
You're like,
Oh God,
is he going to start rapping?

505
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.540
Please God,
don't,
don't let them start rapping.

506
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.260
That is the one amazing thing about that style of music.

507
00:32:22.261 --> 00:32:25.290
That was the one style of music that white people,
as much as they tried,

508
00:32:25.291 --> 00:32:28.680
just could not steal it,
you know,
not say that day.
You know,

509
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.700
Evan and some guys like that.
I haven't been tremendous,
but you know,

510
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.070
that is one.
It was just,
I don't know what it was.
He just,

511
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.750
white people did best bet,
man.

512
00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:43.140
That was that whole Jen and the music was so good that that white kids got into

513
00:32:43.141 --> 00:32:46.410
it and then they did,
hey man,
we ought to put that in our band,

514
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.380
but at that,

515
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.280
but a yo just didn't work.

516
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.470
It just didn't work.
Um,

517
00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.890
there was a lot of stuff from that time that just fucking didn't work.

518
00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:07.050
I remember she slam poetry.
Oh my God,

519
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.590
Jesus Christ.
That was just like,

520
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.500
I just remembered the person who would ever be doing it would always have their

521
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:17.360
eyebrows up and be like,
pointing at you.

522
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:21.770
Like what they were saying was just fucking unbelievable.
It's just unbelievable.

523
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:23.240
And it was like blowing your mind.

524
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.913
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

525
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.950
<v 0>And I would just be sitting there going like that.
You know,</v>

526
00:33:26.951 --> 00:33:31.780
that's kind of a very uh,
mainstream point of view that has been

527
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.710
said about people in power for a long time.

528
00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.270
I guess I've never heard it rhymed before.
So that makes it,
no,
I don't know.

529
00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.130
But I could look at it objectively because that was yet another time to stand
up.

530
00:33:45.131 --> 00:33:49.780
Comedians would go on like,
oh my God,
did she go to take all the standup comedy?

531
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.510
We're all good at be fucking homeless.
Right.

532
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.670
I told you guys about that time when in Massachusetts anyway.

533
00:33:57.671 --> 00:34:00.490
So do you remember he karaoke?
They still have karaoke,
right?

534
00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.630
Which I know a lot of bands hold nervous that that was going to end.

535
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.770
People are going to see live music,
you know,

536
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:12.190
cause some plumber who was going to be standing on stage go on

537
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.383
<v 5>Libby.</v>

538
00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.530
<v 0>Um,
white people at that point,
would it be like,
you know,</v>

539
00:34:20.531 --> 00:34:23.980
I don't think I need to see this generation's Freddie mercury cause I could

540
00:34:23.981 --> 00:34:28.450
watch the guy just plumbed my fucking toilet sink journey.

541
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.860
Think I'm all set on professional musicians at this point.
Thank you.

542
00:34:35.861 --> 00:34:40.370
Karaoke,
but you know
how it is GP,

543
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.630
you're live in fear.
It's what it is.
People live in fear.
So anyways,
um,

544
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.180
the,
uh,

545
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.660
there was something that came out was called carry jokey and basically people in

546
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:59.501
the restaurant or whatever would go on stage and that'd be a teleprompter and

547
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:03.240
they would just read a joke like,
you know,

548
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:07.570
two guys walk into a bar and the bartender says double double day for Blah,
blah,

549
00:35:07.571 --> 00:35:10.330
blah blah blah.
Hey,
I didn't know that.
I would have fucking yelling at,

550
00:35:10.331 --> 00:35:14.300
at an hour ago.
And then they couldn't teach timing.
Right.

551
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.810
But we were all convinced like Duke carry jokey,

552
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.110
it's h it's going to do to stand up comedy.

553
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:24.650
What Karaoke did to live music,

554
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:29.480
which was absolutely nothing unless you were in an incredibly shitty band.

555
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.130
Um,
so one time we were,
uh,

556
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.480
I know I've told this story before,
this is for the new listeners.
Alright.

557
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:43.500
So one time I was doing this gig somewhere in New Hampshire was upstairs at a

558
00:35:45.011 --> 00:35:48.760
bar,
the two story bar.
Okay.

559
00:35:48.761 --> 00:35:52.240
People take drinking seriously in New England to story fucking Bar,

560
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.710
you know,
and there was plenty of room to add on to the bar.
It wasn't like,

561
00:35:56.711 --> 00:36:01.060
you know,
it was this densely populated area.
Um,

562
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.220
I don't know.
This guy was just building up for whatever reason.

563
00:36:04.221 --> 00:36:08.260
So we're on the second story of this fucking building and across the street is

564
00:36:08.261 --> 00:36:11.760
this little carnival
and a,

565
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:16.440
all I remember was you know that,
you know that Viking ship ride you again,

566
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.480
it just basically it's like a giant swing going back and forth,

567
00:36:19.481 --> 00:36:23.460
but you're on that giant boat.
So uh,

568
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:30.450
that is basically right outside the windows on the second floor of this bar.

569
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.820
And there was screened windows too,

570
00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.100
cause it was the summer and I guess this place must not have had air

571
00:36:36.101 --> 00:36:36.934
conditioning.

572
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:41.410
And all I remember was standing on stage bombing and all I could hear was people

573
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.330
screaming on the ride.
So my set,
it turned into like my own little horror film.

574
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.170
And what was funny was the boat was not like parallel to the bar.

575
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.280
It was like pointed at it and it looked like it was going to come right through

576
00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:59.110
the fucking window and then it would go up.

577
00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.780
I remember the guy I was looking at was saying,
you know,

578
00:37:01.781 --> 00:37:03.220
it's very phallic looking right.

579
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:07.270
And I was dying laughing because when the underneath the boat was coming up and

580
00:37:07.271 --> 00:37:10.300
go back,
it looked like,
you know,
that ridiculous shot and porno.

581
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.810
We're just in case you'd think he's really not putting it in there.

582
00:37:13.811 --> 00:37:18.460
They make good and God damn well you know that that's what's happening.
Um,

583
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.320
I always wonder if like the porn star can feel the heat of the Lens,

584
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:28.050
unlike the ball bags and fucking who has,
you know,

585
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.120
maybe that's why they shave their pubes because they got sick of him lighting on

586
00:37:31.121 --> 00:37:34.810
fire during takes.
I don't know.
I've never really seen him behind this.
Actually.

587
00:37:34.811 --> 00:37:38.860
I did see a behind the scenes of a porno recently of a performer,

588
00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:43.861
porn star of this guy getting into the world and then wanting to get out of it

589
00:37:45.851 --> 00:37:49.690
and staying in it
for 20 fucking years.

590
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.780
And,
uh,

591
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.650
I watched the whole thing right up until when he decided to get out of it.

592
00:37:55.651 --> 00:38:00.630
And then the next one was him in Bible study and a,
then I shut it off.

593
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.410
You know,
I was just like,
all right,

594
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.540
I don't want to watch this part.
You know,

595
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:12.770
reminding me that I'm a piece of shit and I should probably look at Bible study

596
00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:14.790
in her something.
I don't know what the fuck it is.
They said something,
oh,

597
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.670
he's wigs me out about that.
Um,
you know what I mean?
Cause he can sit Tivoli,

598
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.130
hey man,
like that stuff doesn't exist man.
You also thinking,
well,
what does this,

599
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.590
what does exist?
These are the ramblings of a guide turned 50 going like,
do,

600
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.950
do I need to hedge my bets and start going back to church?

601
00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.880
But when the higher power,
no,
like this guy not totally buying into this shit.

602
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.550
What is he doing right now?

603
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.850
Is he practicing some sort of sticking pattern on the church pews?

604
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:45.610
40 plays drums later on today.
That's not very respectful.
Um,
all right,
let's,

605
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:48.040
let's do some reads here for this week.
Uh,

606
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.100
grass fed versus grass finished.

607
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.500
Uh,
dear Billy beef breath releasing on your podcasts,

608
00:38:56.501 --> 00:39:01.450
you did an ad for your new sponsor butcher box.
By the way,
I uh,

609
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.331
I tried that,

610
00:39:02.331 --> 00:39:07.331
that pork that they stet swag that they sent me and it was a,

611
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:13.090
you know,
I didn't realize like the original pigs that came over here before,

612
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:14.800
I guess they were all mixed with these other pigs.

613
00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:18.850
It's very like white supremacy the way they have like the pigs and dogs,

614
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:19.930
like pure bred and all that.

615
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.610
Well these pure bred pigs like you gotta you gotta prove that their DNA that

616
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:26.020
these are actually,
you know,

617
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:31.570
I don't know what takes from fucking Liverpool.
I have no idea.

618
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:33.430
All I can tell is that,
you know,

619
00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:36.370
I bought into the hype so I don't know if that affected my taste buds,

620
00:39:36.371 --> 00:39:38.800
but it was one of the best pork chops I've ever had in my life.

621
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.160
So hats off to butcher box.
Anyways,

622
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:45.250
he said you didn't know what the term grass finished beef meats.

623
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.170
It means they are giving you the real thing.
A lot of restaurants.
These,

624
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:55.190
they tell you they serve grass fed beef and they usually charge more for it.

625
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.780
The term used to mean exactly what it sounds like,

626
00:39:58.781 --> 00:40:00.700
but it's all gotten watered down now

627
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.530
down and now it's often just a marketing gimmick.

628
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:10.150
Pretty much all cattle are grass fed.
They are fed grass pellets.

629
00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:10.960
Hey.

630
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.430
Or if they are lucky they get to spend their lives happily grazing in a pasture.

631
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.810
But then all of us,

632
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:21.810
almost all of them get fed grain or other garbage to fatten them up at the feed

633
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:24.700
lot before slaughter grasp finished,

634
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:28.210
however means they eat grass right up until the very end.

635
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.890
I learned this little bit of Trivia when I was working as a travel writer in

636
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:37.630
Hawaii.
I want it to pass it along because I figure I owe you.
That's pretty cool.

637
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.861
Uh,
I started,

638
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:42.820
let's do a podcast and Joe Rogan's podcast because I frequently had long drives

639
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.460
by myself to get to remote areas of the various islands and persons can only

640
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:52.600
listen to so much and a person can only listen to so much Hawaiian music.

641
00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:56.410
That's hilarious.
Uh,
thanks for keeping me company long drives.
No problem.

642
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.890
In case you've never been to Hawaii before and are questioning my comment about

643
00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:03.460
long drives.
The Big island is about the size of the state of Connecticut.

644
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.920
I didn't know that and said Sarah,
no direct routes.

645
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:10.921
It takes more than two hours to get from the Kona side of the big island to the

646
00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:17.050
high low side where the volcano is currently erupting.
You know,

647
00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:21.340
the bright side of that volcano erupting is,
isn't it?
Creating more land,

648
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:28.010
you know?
Well,
you know,
fitting out the population of an Emily.

649
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:32.800
Uh,
here's the link about the term grass fed so you can verify for yourself,

650
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.370
but it's a long article.

651
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:37.840
So probably not something you want to read on the podcast.
Dude.

652
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.640
If it's a short article,
it's not something,
one of my read on the podcast,

653
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:43.670
God knows I fucked that up.

654
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.800
How scary is it to not only live next to a fucking volcano,

655
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:53.440
but to be like on a Goddamn island?
I mean,
I don't,

656
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.870
the only thing that I've,
I've seen that has been not,

657
00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:01.190
not like a little more relaxing is how slow lava the lava has been moving.

658
00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.650
You know,
after it's sort of a rub sweat,
he's still to be near it will,
you know,

659
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.670
spitting up like a fucking toddler.
Right.
Um,

660
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.390
<v 4>okay.</v>

661
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.740
<v 0>Let me see.
Let me read up on this shit.</v>

662
00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.840
Hawaii volcano.

663
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.140
What is the latest why ball cane?

664
00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:25.560
A warning of toxic gas plumes,

665
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.710
a lava spews lays of toxic gas and glass into the air.

666
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.920
This spewing glass.

667
00:42:38.921 --> 00:42:42.460
Did people throw their fucking soda pop bottles down there or is that some

668
00:42:42.461 --> 00:42:47.290
chemically way that all of those minerals with that level of heat turns into

669
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:47.740
glass,

670
00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:52.740
lava acid rain vog sulfur dioxide and now lays new deadly thread emerges.

671
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:03.440
Good fucking Lord.
Can you imagine if you're there right now on your honeymoon?

672
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.570
You can't tell me that's not an almond.

673
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.200
Did I marry the right person?
God,
give me a sign.
That could mean,
you know,
okay,

674
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.500
actually maybe a good thing,
right?
Put the eruption.

675
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.740
You know it's going to fuck your brains out.
I don't,
I don't pretend to know.

676
00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.610
Okay.
First it was lava,
then acid,
rain and fog.

677
00:43:23.611 --> 00:43:27.870
What the fuck is Vog I so far behind the stories,

678
00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:31.260
people know what Vog is.
Fog

679
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.990
vog is a form of air pollution.

680
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:36.560
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

681
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.670
<v 0>That results when sulfur dioxide and other gases and particles emitted by</v>

682
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:44.270
interrupting volcano react with the oxygen and moisture in the presence of

683
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:45.104
sunlight.

684
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:50.410
The word is a poor Manto Portmanteau port man to have the word volcanic smog in

685
00:43:54.211 --> 00:43:55.044
fog.

686
00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.900
You mean the smoke that comes out of a volcano?
They call it vog.

687
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.440
The term is common in the Hawaiian islands.

688
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.920
<v 4>Okay.</v>

689
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.753
<v 0>All right.</v>

690
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:12.760
<v 4>Okay.</v>

691
00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.260
<v 0>Fog is created when volcanic gases react with sunlight,
oxygen,
and moisture.</v>

692
00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:22.180
The results includes sulfur,
sulfuric acid,
and other self.
Jesus fucking Christ

693
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:25.560
as poor people.
Yeah.

694
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.730
Live in that Goddamn Paradise.
Just sitting there,
you know,

695
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.540
so like school gets canceled out there.

696
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:36.840
There will be no school today due to the vog.

697
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.760
We got to go an extra two weeks and Joe,
because we missed those two weeks,

698
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:47.300
you know,
three months earlier when the volcano was erupting.

699
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.910
I can a wide people at tough,
Huh?
Oh did we get a little snow storm?

700
00:44:52.911 --> 00:44:54.950
It's gotta be slippery.

701
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:56.720
<v 4>Okay.</v>

702
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.480
<v 0>You could slip and fall and break your tailbone.</v>

703
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:01.390
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

704
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:06.160
<v 0>Then on the other side,
that's,
and they go,
oh,
really?
Now we could burn to death.</v>

705
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:12.020
Be vaporized.
Right?
You go outside and breathe and poisoned.
So what the fuck?

706
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.350
What does everybody do it not like how poisoned it says it.

707
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:18.251
Jesus Christ.

708
00:45:18.251 --> 00:45:21.460
Can you imagine that shit like you still decide to go ahead with your vacation

709
00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.010
and as you're coming in for a landing,
you seen all that fog.

710
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.983
<v 4>Okay,</v>

711
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.250
<v 0>honey,
honey,
it's okay.
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
We're,</v>

712
00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:33.570
we're on the other side of the island.
Okay.

713
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.310
It's just a honey.
It's just lover.
Okay.

714
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:42.810
It's just lava and a little bit of poison gas and,
and it's,

715
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.470
it's currently still happening.
Other than that,
I mean,
it's going to be fine.

716
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:49.380
You can be sitting on the beach with,
with,

717
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.590
with a lei around your neck and a gas mask on your face,

718
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.690
taking a big gulp of oxygen before you lift the mask and take a sip off you

719
00:45:57.691 --> 00:46:01.920
straw drinking out of a coconut just like we plant.
Come on.

720
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.060
This is our time.

721
00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:04.380
<v 4>Okay,</v>

722
00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.210
<v 0>come on.
We're going to start a family.
Um,
oh fingers.</v>

723
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.670
I couldn't find my shoes.
Okay.

724
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.080
Don't rock day.
I just wanted to go home,

725
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.680
ma.
Um,
alright.
Hey,

726
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.590
stay strong.
Hawaii.
I Dunno.
What else should dope?

727
00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.410
I would sell.
Well,
yeah know if you're near the ocean.
The lava comes.

728
00:46:33.411 --> 00:46:35.360
You just fucking,
just stand in the ocean.

729
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.790
<v 4>Okay.</v>

730
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:38.530
<v 0>Then the sharks come and get you,
right.
I mean,</v>

731
00:46:38.531 --> 00:46:43.320
there's just no way to fucking do it.
How do we literally stare to the Osha?

732
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.610
I be like,
I mean like fucking,
you know,
stand along the beach.

733
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.080
Frolic in the waves.

734
00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.500
As you watch your retirement fund in your house burned up in flames.

735
00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.930
Did anybody else see that footage of that lava?

736
00:46:56.931 --> 00:46:59.720
Just kind of going across the street right towards that white car?

737
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:02.990
Did it bug you that nobody's a key?
She'd get the fucking car out of there.

738
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:05.123
<v 4>Okay.</v>

739
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.300
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
I'll tell you right now,</v>

740
00:47:08.301 --> 00:47:11.240
if you ever steal a car and you want to get rid of it,
that's it.
Steal a car.

741
00:47:11.241 --> 00:47:14.690
Well,
a volcano is erupting.
Have you a little joy ride,
right?

742
00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:19.900
The cops chased you.
Just drive it into some lava and then you fucking jump out.

743
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.740
So what man,
I don't see any car.

744
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.360
And then you know would happen was they would have the dashboard cam and then

745
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:34.930
they'd get you for fucking,
I don't know,
destroying evidence.

746
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.910
I don't know what the fuck it,
why,
who knows?

747
00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:41.070
I don't pretend to understand things.
All right.
Improve Your Franch.

748
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.300
Dear Billy Bilingual,

749
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:46.930
I'm a 24 year old American man who completed a year abroad in Paris.

750
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:51.310
I knew no French before going and now I'm now flowing.
Yeah,

751
00:47:51.311 --> 00:47:52.930
well that's the way to do it.
You're over there.

752
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.930
I know you've been using Rosetta stone and that's really helpful.

753
00:47:55.931 --> 00:48:00.160
But here's a tip on how you can become conversationally fluid flowing.
Oh Great.

754
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.870
The best thing to do is listen to the audio book and read this text

755
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:08.290
simultaneously in French.
I know you hate reading,

756
00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.670
but if you get a good narrator,
it can be entertaining.
It will make you literate.

757
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.190
Oh yeah.
I've been reading,
I've been reading French books,

758
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:18.250
like kids' books to my daughter.
Um,

759
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:23.290
I read Harry Potter and
Lick Cole Dis

760
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:29.070
saucer is whatever,
and I was able to chat up French women afterwards.

761
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:34.080
Hope this helps and go fuck yourself.
Well,
wait a minute.

762
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.410
If someone's just speaking French and nobody's translating it for me.

763
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.120
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

764
00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.530
<v 0>I'm just listening to French.</v>

765
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.120
<v 4>Okay.</v>

766
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.740
<v 0>How does it work?
Um,
audio book</v>

767
00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.190
and read the texts simultaneously.
Let me see something.

768
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.180
French audio book

769
00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.800
with Avec text.

770
00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.320
Let's see what I got here.

771
00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.950
French parallel audio.
Oh,
we're going to,
you know what?

772
00:49:09.951 --> 00:49:13.610
I'm going to do it.
I'll give it a shot.
Thank you very much.

773
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:18.640
Thank you very much.
All Jesus.
Look at this one.
Oh Gee.

774
00:49:18.641 --> 00:49:23.000
She is a police.
Caught me with the prostitute.

775
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:29.930
What's up bill?
A big fan of yours.
I enjoy your all.
I enjoy your,

776
00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:33.350
all your standups.
Okay.
I'm gonna say this is this first draft.

777
00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.770
Your Netflix originals especially F is for family.
Thank you.

778
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.470
And your interviews on youtube.
Mostly the ones on Conan.

779
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:45.500
I'm 28 years old.
Single.
No kids live alone.
Kind of a loner.

780
00:49:45.501 --> 00:49:48.710
I smoke weed.
I work midnight at a gas station.

781
00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.940
All right,
let's do this again.
28 years old,
single,
no kids.
I live alone.

782
00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:58.260
Kind of a loner.
I smoke weed.
I work midnight at a gas station.
I never go out.

783
00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:02.160
I don't drink.
I don't do any kind of clubs are hardcore drugs.

784
00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:07.980
I just get horny.
I usually have girls,
but not this time.
Uh,

785
00:50:07.981 --> 00:50:11.460
I fucked it up with every girl I was talking to.

786
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:16.440
Somehow I managed to be rude by asking them if they enjoy giving head.
Oh boy.

787
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.780
Uh,
I got to say,
man,

788
00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.060
I got caught up in some bullshit tomorrow.

789
00:50:24.061 --> 00:50:27.000
I have a trial and I'm a little nervous.
I have to get it.

790
00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:31.240
A court appointed attorney.
I don't trust anyone though.

791
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:35.260
The lawyer I was supposed to have would stop asking me for money when I told her

792
00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.930
I have it in three days.
I don't lie.
I'm honest as fuck.

793
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.290
All right.
I always get nervous when people say,
I don't lie,
have you?

794
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:48.910
But anybody knows me,
knows I tell the truth.
I didn't do that.
All right.

795
00:50:48.911 --> 00:50:53.500
So basically what happened,
I got pulled over by the cops telling me straight up.

796
00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:57.880
Uh,
they saw me talking with a known prostitute for sure.

797
00:50:57.881 --> 00:51:02.410
It was a sting operation,
even though she showed me her tits.
She was cute.

798
00:51:02.411 --> 00:51:06.430
Too Cute.
If you ask me a little too cute.
Um,

799
00:51:06.431 --> 00:51:09.670
so she got in my car and asked me what I wanted.
I told her,

800
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:14.360
but she wanted more money,
so I said,
no thanks.
Uh,

801
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.690
she got out and I decided to go home.

802
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.960
I pull out into the street and literally not even 30 seconds later,

803
00:51:19.961 --> 00:51:22.960
I see lights come on behind me.
Luckily I didn't go to jail.

804
00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.780
They gave me a ticket and impounded my car though.
All right.

805
00:51:25.781 --> 00:51:28.750
So what's the problem?
I've been bullshit.
My mom,

806
00:51:28.751 --> 00:51:31.030
I told her the car's in the shop.

807
00:51:31.031 --> 00:51:34.030
I thought you said you don't lie and that you're honest is fuck.

808
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.940
Anyways,
I had to spend two grand to get it back,
but it was in my mom's name,

809
00:51:39.941 --> 00:51:42.970
so I had to come up with another lie.
I thought you said you didn't lie.

810
00:51:42.971 --> 00:51:44.110
Give honest says fuck.

811
00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:48.880
And I was trying to sell the car even though that makes no fucking sense.
What?

812
00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:54.340
So I needed paperwork stating she was my mother giving me permission to retrieve

813
00:51:54.341 --> 00:51:58.210
my car from the county clerk's office and have it notarized by the bank.
I know,

814
00:51:58.211 --> 00:52:01.970
Bill,
I don't lie.
If I told my mom she this,

815
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:05.440
she probably die.
All right,

816
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.140
so we kind of covered his tracks and no joke.

817
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.750
I'm the youngest of five all fuck ups.
All boys.

818
00:52:10.751 --> 00:52:14.950
I'm supposed to be the good one and am I was just being stupid.

819
00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.680
I think the only thing that's worrying me is the phone.

820
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.990
Probably like five to 10 grand.
Oh,

821
00:52:19.991 --> 00:52:24.220
well thanks for the time to read this by the way.
I live.
I'm like,
see,
we live.

822
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.510
I have tickets to your show.
Uh,
can't wait anyways,
thanks.

823
00:52:28.511 --> 00:52:33.100
And Go fuck yourself.
All right,
well she's probably going to find out.

824
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.920
I would just tell her,
I just tell him to say,
listen,

825
00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.840
I fucked up.
You know,
I fucked up.

826
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:46.200
Uh,
she's your mother.
She'll forgive you,
right?

827
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:49.333
<v 4>I Dunno.</v>

828
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:52.830
<v 0>I think I would be more worried about the five to $10,000.
Fine.</v>

829
00:52:52.831 --> 00:52:57.090
Then your mom not loving you anymore.
All right.
You fucked up.

830
00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.380
You made a mistake.
Everybody makes mistakes.
I make mistakes.
You'll,

831
00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.500
you made a mistake.
Um,
you know,

832
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:08.340
it's with the fucking life is you make mistakes.
You learn from your mistakes,

833
00:53:08.341 --> 00:53:12.090
you move on,
you try to do better.
All right.
That's it.

834
00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:15.090
I've said it for a long time.
If people were cars,
we'd be recalled.

835
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.380
There's a reason the world is so fucked up.
It's because humans are running it.

836
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.670
Okay?
We just smart enough to be fucking morons.

837
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:28.590
Um,
all right.
Good luck to you.
My friend's dad wants to pay me to get naked.

838
00:53:28.591 --> 00:53:30.510
Jesus fucking Christ.

839
00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:39.250
Okay.
Well the last one,
girlfriend and best friends graduating.
Same time,

840
00:53:39.251 --> 00:53:43.750
different places.
Thank you.
A nice sit,
calm trope.
I can finish with here.

841
00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:49.010
I got two dates in one night.
All right,
let's get through this one.
Mike Day.

842
00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:52.720
My friend's dad wants to pay me to get naked.
Oh,
Jesus.

843
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.710
A Mr. William Frederick [inaudible].
Hope you're doing good.

844
00:53:56.711 --> 00:54:00.520
Big Fan of the podcast and all your other shit.
Keep doing what you're doing.

845
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:04.060
I'm a 24 year old guy from the UK.
Okay.

846
00:54:04.061 --> 00:54:08.560
The UK until recently I've been working behind the bar in the local pub where my

847
00:54:08.561 --> 00:54:10.960
friend's dad would drink regularly.

848
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:16.830
I'd met him I handful of times over the past 10 years or so as his son,

849
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:20.120
as his son is one of my best friends.

850
00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:23.150
He's about 70 years old and a very devout Catholic.
Oh,

851
00:54:23.151 --> 00:54:24.560
that's not a good characteristic.

852
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:29.000
Who has also worked at the church in some other capacity or another?

853
00:54:29.001 --> 00:54:32.990
I shouldn't blame the whole religion.
Okay.
Because maybe he's a good guy.

854
00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.170
All right.
I've always got a weird vibe from him.
I'll boy,

855
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:39.470
and he started to see me even with her out Jesus.

856
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.260
After seeing him multiple times in a week,

857
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.090
he was giving me big tips,
which is rare in the UK,

858
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:51.080
and he would cut my hand with both hands for 10 seconds or so.

859
00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:52.880
When he gave them money to me,

860
00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.970
he'd stare into my eyes saying all this weird complimentary stuff about me.
Like,

861
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:06.010
you're a very good bar man,
and you'll go far.

862
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.970
Sorry.
The bad accent.
So I started to feel something was off about this guy.

863
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:16.710
Yeah.
God.
This is like when quint slit into the mouth of the shark,

864
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:20.580
a one day after a month,

865
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:25.350
a few months of generous tips from him and general weird encounters.

866
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:30.420
He had about five large glasses of red wine and got pretty drunk.

867
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.960
As I was walking around the pub collecting glasses,

868
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:37.800
he called me over to him and pulled me to one side and a dark dimly lit corner.

869
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.360
He hushed his voice,
ah,

870
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:45.630
and got really close to me with his putrid breath wafting into my nose and said

871
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:48.430
something along the lines of,
right.

872
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:52.450
I have a proposition for you.
First off,

873
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.840
I just want to make it clear that I'm not gay.
Oh,
Jesus.

874
00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:01.380
I'm not gay at all.
Right.
Um,

875
00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.110
well,
I want to do,
but I do have,

876
00:56:05.111 --> 00:56:07.860
what I do have is an appreciation of for the male form,

877
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.570
I can't keep doing this accident when I do have is an appreciation for the male

878
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.830
form.
I used to have a boy who I would pay 150 pounds,

879
00:56:14.831 --> 00:56:18.940
which is 200 euros.
That's our 203 American really

880
00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.900
to allow me to look at his body a few times per week.

881
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.420
I wouldn't touch him or force him to do anything.

882
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:32.040
He would simply get undressed and I would appreciate his body and pay him for
it.

883
00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:36.660
Time to sit.
Sound like something you would be interested in?
Oh my God.

884
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.370
I immediately said no.
He was pretty shocked,
but I didn't make a scene.

885
00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:45.730
I just laughed it off and said,
sorry,
I'm not interested.

886
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.590
The next day he came into the pub and practically begged me not to tell his son

887
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:52.360
and started to give me even

888
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:53.900
<v 2>okay.</v>

889
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.140
<v 0>Fingertips in the following weeks.
I tried to refuse,</v>

890
00:56:57.141 --> 00:56:59.810
but he insisted it was basically hush money.

891
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:04.490
It was like I was wrapped up in some sort of big scandal and being paid for my

892
00:57:04.491 --> 00:57:05.324
silence.

893
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:08.120
<v 2>Okay.</v>

894
00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.110
<v 0>Um,</v>

895
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:13.190
there was one time where he ran into the pub looking really flustered during a

896
00:57:13.191 --> 00:57:18.160
storm.
What little hair he has left was all over the place and we stuck to his,

897
00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.400
to his red,
wet veiny face,
Jesus Christ.

898
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:25.100
His clothes were drenched.

899
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.250
He was really out of breath and he ran up to me and said,
you haven't told him,

900
00:57:28.251 --> 00:57:30.950
have you?
That's fucking nuts.

901
00:57:30.951 --> 00:57:33.710
Because the person was probably acting weird or slightly different.

902
00:57:33.711 --> 00:57:38.300
I haven't told him no.
I said he was clearly really worried about what he'd said,

903
00:57:38.301 --> 00:57:42.860
so I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for him as he's clearly gay and most

904
00:57:42.861 --> 00:57:47.060
likely suppressed it his entire life to Dan being a devout Catholic.

905
00:57:47.061 --> 00:57:49.430
That's what I was thinking.
I feel bad for that.
I felt,
you know,

906
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:55.160
obviously that you had to fucking have that fucking interaction.
But I mean,

907
00:57:55.161 --> 00:57:56.360
yeah,
that's what this is.

908
00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.020
This is why you should just let people be who the fuck they are.
Uh,

909
00:58:00.021 --> 00:58:03.290
my gut instinct is to just never mention it to anyone.

910
00:58:03.291 --> 00:58:05.960
But a second opinion would be great.
Yeah.
Do it.

911
00:58:05.961 --> 00:58:09.800
I wouldn't say it's these 70 fucking years old.
All right.

912
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:15.980
You know,
to his credit,
he asked you,
said no,

913
00:58:15.981 --> 00:58:20.620
and then that was it.
And now he's just saying,
please don't tell anybody.
Anyway,

914
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:24.350
so essentially I know that one of my best friend's dad is trying to cheat on his

915
00:58:24.351 --> 00:58:28.670
mom with young men.
So part of me feels like his wife has the right to know,

916
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:31.340
but on the other hand,
I don't want to ruin their family.

917
00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:34.520
So my question to you is,
should I bring it up with my friend?
What should I do?

918
00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.690
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Uh,

919
00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.830
but instead just have a nice thanks a dog.
Go Fuck Yourself.
One said,

920
00:58:42.831 --> 00:58:47.450
just have a nice day for me.
Will you?
Um,

921
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:50.660
all right.
Uh,
sending loud to yourself,
knee and the little baby.
Thank you.

922
00:58:50.661 --> 00:58:53.200
Looking forward to the new efs family.
Thank you.
Ah,
not the case.

923
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:56.990
Fucking seven years old.
I mean,
uh,

924
00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.370
what are you going to do at that point?

925
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:00.893
<v 2>You know,</v>

926
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:06.770
<v 0>I don't,
I don't know as the Guy Bisexual,
I have no fucking idea.</v>

927
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

928
00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:09.150
<v 0>All I know is he asked,</v>

929
00:59:09.151 --> 00:59:13.230
you said no and he's left you alone other than panicking that you're going to

930
00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:16.920
fucking tell somebody.
So,
uh,

931
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:21.730
I feel like his,

932
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.230
<v 4>okay.</v>

933
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:27.610
<v 0>If he wants to tell people that's his,
that's his thing.</v>

934
00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.520
You know what I mean?
I don't fucking know

935
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.650
fall.
Yeah.
I mean,

936
00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.680
I would think that his wife on some level might even fucking know who the fuck

937
00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:42.690
that relationships are very complex to just fucking jump in there and think that

938
00:59:42.841 --> 00:59:45.750
you're going to be playing the hero when you don't have any of the information.

939
00:59:45.751 --> 00:59:49.780
I would just just walk away from it.
Yeah.
Just walk away.

940
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.400
That's what I would do personally.
You know?
Uh,
Jesus Christ.

941
00:59:54.401 --> 00:59:57.820
What a story I felt.
I was watching a movie.
All right.

942
00:59:57.821 --> 01:00:01.210
Girlfriend and best friend graduating.
Same time,
different places.
Dear Billy,

943
01:00:01.211 --> 01:00:06.211
bombshell by breast friend in new girlfriend or graduating college on the same

944
01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:10.720
day and I don't know who's ceremony to attend.
I just finished my junior year,

945
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:12.541
uh,

946
01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:17.130
of college and recently started dating a girl one year older who is graduating

947
01:00:17.131 --> 01:00:20.700
in less than a week.
However,
my best friends since I was five,

948
01:00:20.701 --> 01:00:23.730
also graduating college on the same day at the same time,

949
01:00:23.731 --> 01:00:27.560
but at a different school.
Needless to say,
I cannot be at both places at once.

950
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.480
I'm not really sure who ceremony I should attend.

951
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.370
I don't want to piss off my new girlfriend,

952
01:00:32.371 --> 01:00:36.630
especially because she's way too hot for me.
Um,

953
01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:38.910
well she's way too hard for you.

954
01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:42.810
That's a good thing to try to like keep yourself level is don't fucking jump

955
01:00:42.811 --> 01:00:47.010
every time she asks you to.
MMM.

956
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:53.220
I,
I would go to my buddy's graduation to say,
unfortunately,
you know

957
01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:58.920
it,
they just
came at the same time.

958
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.810
You know what's funny is a one would be like,
can you a good issue.

959
01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:09.780
Like,
and I would never do that if I was dating a girl for a year.
And she's like,

960
01:01:09.781 --> 01:01:10.111
listen,

961
01:01:10.111 --> 01:01:14.270
your graduation is the same day as my best friend since sounds five before she

962
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.550
got through it,
I died.
Listen,
I get it.

963
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:21.390
No fucking problem.
Hey,
here's a little secret.

964
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.610
I don't want to go to the graduation ceremony myself.

965
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.100
I just got to get the peace of God damn paper.

966
01:01:26.101 --> 01:01:29.670
That's the only reason why I'm showing up.
Don't worry.
I'll take a video.

967
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:35.850
All right.
It gives a fuck.
It's just,
it's a ceremony.
MMM.

968
01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:39.460
He says his name.
We're really unsure.

969
01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:42.640
I can justify picking a new girlfriend over my best friend,

970
01:01:42.641 --> 01:01:46.060
but at the same time he doesn't give me sex.
So there's that aspect.

971
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.740
Let me know what I think should do.

972
01:01:47.741 --> 01:01:49.690
I don't think you should operate from a place of fear.

973
01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:52.240
I think you should go with loyalty and you should go to your friend's thing.

974
01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.370
That's what I would do.
You know,
if she can't understand it,
uh,

975
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.340
what are you going to do?
Plenty of fish in the sea.
All right.

976
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.290
False rape allegations.
Ruining my friend's life.
Jesus fucking Christ.

977
01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:10.690
I hate reading these things cause I don't have any of the information.

978
01:02:10.691 --> 01:02:12.540
Now you gonna tell me it's a false rape.
Thanks.

979
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:13.720
So now I don't know if I'm actually,

980
01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.920
I'm going to be supporting a victim or if I'm going to be fucking,
uh,

981
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:21.510
supporting somebody who really did something.
Here's the situation.

982
01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:23.980
I'm curling my senior year of college,
my graduate,
I did,

983
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:28.720
I'm not reading this fucking thing.
I'm not reading this fucking thing.

984
01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:34.910
Look at the psycho bitch got mad at Blah Blah.
Now,
this is all like,

985
01:02:34.911 --> 01:02:37.730
this is what's wrong with the Internet right now is because now I'm going to

986
01:02:37.731 --> 01:02:39.470
listen to one side of the fucking story.

987
01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.190
The woman who you call a psycho bitch is not going to get a chance to tell her

988
01:02:43.191 --> 01:02:47.240
side of the story and I'm going to make a snap judgment and say,
yeah,
you know,

989
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:50.630
this is a psycho bitch.
I just,
you know,
I like,

990
01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.930
these are like the question.
Choose to be a lot lighter people.

991

my best friend's dad is 70 and I found out he's gay.

01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:06.800
Should I tell them or should I keep this secret?
What the way?
