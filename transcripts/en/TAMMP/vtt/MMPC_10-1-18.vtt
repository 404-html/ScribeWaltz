00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.721
Hey,

2
00:00:00.721 --> 00:00:04.110
what's going on is bill burns time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.180
October 1st,
2018 what's going on?
How are you?

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.730
What are you doing?
Are you going to go sober?
October?
C'Mon man,

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.780
it rhymes.
Everybody's doing it.
I think Rogan and those guys are doing it again.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.680
Um,
I would,
I would do it.
Um,
but uh,

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.030
I'm doing Boston this weekend and there's no fucking way.
Okay.

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.540
This just certain cities you can't stay sober and all right.

9
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.470
And that's one of them.
So,
um,
how about take it easy?

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.730
October settled down there fucking October.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.540
Um,
anyways,
I just got back from Denver.

12
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:47.010
I'll tell you what a weekend I had.
Um,
by the way,

13
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.030
the fucking cab driver almost killed me coming home for the fucking airport.

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.710
She was a sweetheart,
right?
Talking about kids,
she's a grandmother and all that.

15
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.580
Oh Wow.
It's got to be amazing and blah,
blah.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.570
She goes to make a left onto my street and ran.
She turns her left hand,

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.280
turns at signal on for whatever reason,

18
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.060
she just starts drifting and she's coasting up to what she's going to stop,

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.110
you know,
to make a left.
She starts drifting like over,

20
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.710
like the white dotted line there into the right lane.

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.520
So now people can't go in the left lane and she's also in the right lane.

22
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:23.250
And I'm literally like moving away from the door like what the fuck?

23
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
And people are slowing down beeping at her.
So she just cuts the wheel hard.

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.540
Rather than pulling up a little bit and getting in the lane,
she cut the wheel,

25
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:31.890
hearts are fucking ass.

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.910
Her right ass cheek of her Prius was sitting in that fucking lane.
And I'm like,

27
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:37.200
oh my God,
we're going to get killed.

28
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.490
So there's all these cars come in and people are beeping at her and I could feel

29
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:45.690
her getting stressed.
So I just calmly just said,
uh,
yeah.
You know,

30
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:47.790
there's a lot of traffic this time of day,
you know,

31
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.610
there's always a lot of traffic.
You know,
what are you going to,

32
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.490
I just nice and fucking chill.
Like,
I'm not getting impatient,
right.

33
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.860
But she's still gotten patient and she saw a gap and she shoots through it and I

34
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:03.861
see this fucking guy on a motorcycle that's a little ahead of the pack of the

35
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.780
cars and you know,
it's two lanes on the other side of the road.

36
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:09.030
He's in the right lane and um,

37
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.620
she pulls out and I just go,
guy in the motorcycle got a motorcycle.

38
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.140
I thought the guy was going to fucking t bone,
right.

39
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:21.141
The bright into me and she gets across the street and she laughs at me.

40
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.870
She goes,
I saw him,
I saw him.

41
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.710
It's like you fucking saw him and you still went.

42
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.970
I'm telling you that she needed glasses because every time she would pull up to

43
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:37.530
a red light,
she would stop like 20 car lengths behind and then slowly,

44
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.250
slowly like creep up.
So I don't know what her fucking deal.

45
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.130
She's like,
I saw him.
They saw him.
Yeah,
I saw him too.

46
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.080
You just didn't see the fucking look on his face.

47
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.400
Look like Eli Eli Manning two weeks ago,
you know when his face is all mushed up.

48
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:58.280
He had that,
you know,
like you saw that chicken the ring.
Um,

49
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.450
yeah,
that's one of those things where I was just like,

50
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:01.710
I know what that feels like.

51
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.990
<v 0>She scared the fucking shit out of that guy</v>

53
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.630
cause he had like a bunch of cars behind him too and he had fucking slam on that

54
00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:14.180
slam.
But he had to like,
there was,
it was definitely

55
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.580
<v 1>okay.</v>

56
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.810
<v 0>All right.
Let's be honest,
you almost die.</v>

57
00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:20.170
Every time we get on a motorcycle is pretty much what happens.

58
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:24.710
So I would say on a,
on a scale of one to 10,
that was,
it was a good six.

59
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.443
It was a six,

60
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.630
but as six on a motorcycle is a fucking,
you know,
that's like a nine in a car.

61
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:38.210
It's probably even worse.
It's even worse because it's like,
you know,

62
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:42.710
you've got an air bags and shit.
It's,
yeah.
Um,
anyways,

63
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.990
I saw him,
I saw him
fucking laughing at me.

64
00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:51.470
Like I'm a fucking little girl in the back seat.
I'm like,
oh,
fake.
You know,

65
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.430
I dunno where you're from with that Transylvanian fucking accent,
but uh,

66
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.880
I don't know how you do it over there.
We got back waves over here.

67
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.490
Bay.
Um,
so anyways,

68
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.190
um,
what was it?
Friday night,

69
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.380
I actually did a sold out show at the fabulous forum in Los Angeles.

70
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.340
The same place.

71
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.120
<v 0>Where,</v>

73
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.740
you know Larry Bird Magic Johnson had their great battles.

74
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.340
What Kevin Mchale fucking clothes line fucking Nah,

75
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.550
Kurt Rambis all of that shit.
I saw the Great Mario Lemieux play there.

76
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.540
I saw Wayne Gretzky play there.
Um,

77
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.870
I remember seeing the 1999 Lakers there with like fucking shack and Colby with

78
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:43.890
del Harris coaching and I believe Dennis Rodman was on that team.

79
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.873
<v 1>MMM.</v>

80
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.500
<v 0>And then I knew,
I saw the foo fighters,
I saw the queens of the stone age.
I,
uh,</v>

81
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.910
saw a bunch of shows there and then all of a sudden I'm fucking that man.

82
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:57.780
It was unbelievable.
So I want to thank everybody who came out to the show.

83
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.650
<v 1>MMM.</v>

84
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.520
<v 0>Not gonna lie.
It might've been the best show of my career.</v>

85
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.660
I thank fucking Christ because I had a bunch of friends there and that was not

86
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:09.290
the one we wanted to walk off stage.
Like,
ah,

87
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.450
I hit the warning track and every not,
that was good.

88
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:16.870
It was an impressive poppop to make it out to end the inning bill.
Um,

89
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.480
but we went down there,
um,

90
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.980
<v 1>okay.</v>

91
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.840
<v 0>During the day,
me and dean and all these guys went down there and,
uh,</v>

92
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.110
you know,
did the deal,
you know,
I sat at the drums and all that.

93
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:30.390
We played a dean was posting clips and Shit.

94
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:34.530
Dean's never sung any better and it was just,
it was fucking,
it was awesome.

95
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:39.030
But I almost fucked up because we played from two 30 to like six o'clock,

96
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.120
two 30 to fucking six o'clock.

97
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.780
And like I was gassed around five and a then another buddy of ours showed up

98
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.970
right at five.
So we played for like another hour.

99
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.520
And the forum people were so cool because they wanted us done by like five 30

100
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:58.550
and we just kept pushing it a little bit and I got off the stage and I was

101
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.480
fucking wiped out.
Um,

102
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.920
and I was like,
oh no,
did I just fucking use up all my energy for the show?

103
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.800
But fortunately,
uh,
you know,

104
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.160
the butterflies get going and everything and uh,

105
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.110
it was so fucking cool.
They got a,
they got you,

106
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:22.520
they give you this little gift bag.
I'll tell you this food when you guys,

107
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.640
you guys work there eventually,
right when you guys listened to,

108
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:29.410
when you fucking sell it out.
Um,
they got it says,
uh,

109
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.413
what'd it say?

110
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.770
The forum backstage is just really super fucking high quality,

111
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.900
like tote bag.
It's something that I would never take,
but it had,
it had like,

112
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.280
it was embroidered and it had like the forum logo on it.
Um,

113
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.990
then inside it had a bunch of t shirts and,

114
00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:53.750
and as a fucking hoodies and stuff that all said that a backstage thing on it.

115
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.980
So it's kind of a fucking obnoxious thing to where if you have it,

116
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.380
I guess you'd have to know,
you'd be like,
oh,

117
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.640
that guy must have fucking performed at the forum.
But it was,
it was fucking,

118
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.840
it was so cool.
So anyway,

119
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:09.930
so I'm waiting to go up and I got to a dean and fucking Joe Barton,

120
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:13.220
nick destroyed and they went up there like they were going up at like the

121
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.710
fucking,
the store,
the laugh factory,

122
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.220
not announcing their Dean's always just fucking got his arms up,

123
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:23.510
like this is going to be fucking awesome.
So he went up there,
crushed it,

124
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:28.250
comes off stage,
he's got like goosebumps and Shit fucking,
you know,

125
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.720
Christmas morning grin on his face and then Barton it goes up there just fucking

126
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:36.920
levels the place.
And uh,
I dunno,

127
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:39.710
I kind of fed off that.
I'm like,
well,
these guys aren't even fucking nervous.

128
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:44.711
So I went out there and the sound is incredible in that place because,

129
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.800
um,
now it's,
it's strictly a music venue.

130
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.930
So they fixed all the sound and you know,

131
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:55.550
shit wasn't bouncing around all over the place and,
uh,
the crowd,

132
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.810
you know,
you could bring him up,

133
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.200
he could bring him down to a whisper and then get them going again.

134
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.080
And I did like 90 minutes,
literally didn't want to get up to stage,

135
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.520
but I was so fucking

136
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.910
focused on having a good show because,
uh,

137
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.910
you mean every time I land at lax,

138
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:17.180
I look at that building and also the new football stadium,
they make it.

139
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:21.140
But I always look at the La Forum and I always just think of the showtime Lakers

140
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.230
and the Boston Celtics and uh,
and the Pistons when they played them in the fine,

141
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:31.220
just think of all of that like legendary eighties NBA hoop.
And,

142
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:35.870
uh,
if I fucking had a bad set there,
every time I landed,
I'd have to be like,
oh,

143
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:39.800
and I bombed there.
So,

144
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.653
um,

145
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.830
I was on stage about 40 minutes before I finally stopped and took in the fact

146
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:48.740
that I was there.
It was so like,
you know,

147
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.300
focused on just having a good show and I,
I fucking,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

148
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.470
I got all of that one.
I walked out of there.
No fucking regrets.
So,
um,

149
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.090
I really want to thank everybody.
I know I've already said that,

150
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.980
but I really want to thank everybody that showed up.

151
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:05.490
That was like the fucking night of my life.
And um,

152
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.120
you know,
I had this great after party.
There was all these friends,

153
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.680
people from emphasis of family,
um,

154
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.040
comedians and the people I took acting class with,
my,

155
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.730
my wife went out of the way in w you know,

156
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.690
invited all these friends and families and um,
it was fucking killer,
right?

157
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.090
And,
but typical meat,
I'm sitting there,
I'm having a good time and all that shit.

158
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.020
And then it's just like,

159
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:33.050
I have like a 9:44 AM flight the next day to go to fucking Denver,

160
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.760
right.
To work with fucking the pride at Trenton,
New Jersey,
Paul Versey.
Right.

161
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.310
So I kind of learned something,
right?

162
00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:48.311
Cause I went the next day I went to Denver and it was this beautiful opera

163
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:52.170
house,
right?
Just fucking beautiful.

164
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.480
But it had these really high,
high,

165
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.660
high ceilings in the balconies were way in the back.

166
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.100
And I think that's so those people sing opera that were ridiculous so they can

167
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.350
just blast it out.

168
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.850
And it just fills up the whole arena.
Like I,
that's something I,
I,
you know,

169
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:09.511
when I was in Italy,

170
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:12.180
I wanted to go to one of those and just see what the big deal was.
You know,

171
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.960
see if it made me cry.
I had to bring a handkerchief.

172
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.950
That's the funniest shit ever.

173
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.200
Those are the old Italian guys go in there fucking crying.

174
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.950
So it was designed for that.

175
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:27.450
Then I came in there with my fucking Dick and shit show and,
uh,

176
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.670
I couldn't really hear myself from the first show and I'm kind of shouting and I

177
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:35.760
had gone on Twitter and I was reading all these,
all this fucking,
you know,

178
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:40.400
the hysteria that's on Twitter right now with this,
this,
uh,
I,

179
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:43.660
and a Ford thing going on.
And it's,

180
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.280
it's just everybody is just yelling at each other and just,

181
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:51.270
everybody's making these fucking,
I'm doing it right now saying everybody,

182
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:56.271
but there's a lot of people are just making these fucking huge,

183
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.670
huge,
huge statements on both sides.

184
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.170
All of them just inflammatory for the most part.

185
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.410
And,
um,
I was the,

186
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.080
I said this,
it's just fucking insane.

187
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.470
So many people who are making the case about themselves under the guise of

188
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:18.780
supporting the defendant,
you know,

189
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.770
and then there was all these other fucking idiots on the other side,
like a Yo,

190
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.330
fuck,
that bitch is dead meat meatheads shit.

191
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.490
And um,
I mean I'm a comedian,
I got to know what's going on.

192
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:37.350
So I was just sort of reading that and it just sort of affected my attitude when

193
00:11:37.351 --> 00:11:38.131
I went on stage.

194
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:41.400
I think I just came out too fucking hard and sounded too angry and I had to kind

195
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:45.430
of adjust on the,
uh,
the second show and then I couldn't,

196
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:48.030
I couldn't really hear myself.
Um,

197
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.380
but we got it fixed for the next show and then Sunday night it was great.

198
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.790
But uh,

199
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.160
<v 2>yeah,</v>

200
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.100
<v 0>I kind of learned something where it's like when you do a show as big as that,</v>

201
00:11:58.101 --> 00:12:01.160
you just,
you don't want to do it again for like five days,
you know,

202
00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.990
and then go to a really fucking small place kind of bomb a little bit and just

203
00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:08.210
sort of shake off the memory of what you just did.

204
00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:13.010
And then you can just go back to being normal again.
Because I'm,
I was like,

205
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.630
I was all over the map,
the first show.

206
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:22.640
Like I was still thinking about the forum the night before going,

207
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.630
oh wait,
I did the joke this cause it was,
you know,
it was fucking,
it was him.

208
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.790
It was incredible experience.
Um,

209
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.740
the only I can equate it to is when I drank again is in Ireland.

210
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.850
And I remember drinking it.
Go on,

211
00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:36.860
this fucking doesn't taste any different than America.

212
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.550
And then I came back to America and I fucking drank a Guinness and I almost spit

213
00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:41.384
it out.

214
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.220
So then when I had to do was I had to go fucking drink like Busch light,

215
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.780
you know,
and work my way back up to American Guinness word tasted good again.

216
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.480
You know what I mean?
I think when you have like a big fucking night,

217
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:58.870
it's probably not a good idea to have a 9:44 AM flight the next fucking day and

218
00:13:00.381 --> 00:13:01.550
then have to go,
you know?

219
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

220
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.670
<v 0>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I,
I was like,
it was kind of beating myself up,</v>

221
00:13:07.671 --> 00:13:08.241
going to help them,

222
00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:10.760
but at the end of the end of the show that they fucking stood up and they had a

223
00:13:10.761 --> 00:13:12.800
good time and I was like,
oh,
that was one of those ones.

224
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.410
Like I couldn't hear the fucking laughter.
So,
um,

225
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.300
I want to thank everybody in Denver came out just fucking crazy,
insane,

226
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.290
great crowds tonight.
This is just me kissing everybody's fucking ass.

227
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:27.620
Thank you for,
you know,
Denver is a place that I've always loved going,

228
00:13:27.621 --> 00:13:31.160
but I didn't really get to get out too much,
you know,

229
00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:34.970
cause I felt like I was going to get sick and for once in my fucking life,

230
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.990
um,
I actually was like,
you know what,

231
00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:43.130
I'm just going to stay in the fucking hotel room and just rest up.
Uh,

232
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.880
which is basically what I did.
So I didn't even get,
I,
you know,

233
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.160
I always walk around,
I always go out,
they have like these train tracks,
things,

234
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.750
you know,
and there's all these like fucking white kids you see out there.

235
00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:54.710
It's like a,

236
00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:58.610
is that kid homeless or as he's playing hacky sack with a hacky sack with the

237
00:13:58.611 --> 00:14:02.990
fuck,
like you know,
a lot of that fucking,
uh,
we'd vibe,
you know,

238
00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:06.200
when they've got all these great fucking food and I missed all of it,

239
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.340
but I did go to Churchill's last night and had a nice fucking cigar.
So,
um,

240
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.080
anyways,
sorry man.

241
00:14:12.081 --> 00:14:15.950
I know this is like a big fucking hallmark Goddamn podcasts,
but whatever.

242
00:14:15.951 --> 00:14:17.150
It's not every day you do the form.

243
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:20.900
I don't know if I'll ever fucking get to do that again.
Hopefully I will.

244
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.950
If I don't,
I did it.
I could have done it any fucking better.

245
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.780
Do they painted my name on the fucking wall?
You know,
you look around,

246
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:33.500
it's just like ACDC,
James Brown,
all of this fucking shit.

247
00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:35.120
And there's my stupid name.
I mean,

248
00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:37.280
I'm sure they're going to park the forklift in front of it,

249
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.570
but a whatever for one night for one night.

250
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.200
Um,
anyways,
um,

251
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.990
let's talk formula one racing.

252
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.370
I keep forgetting because my fucking got fucked up.
I saw,

253
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:55.310
I watched the highlights.
Lewis Hamilton won over there.

254
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.760
I believe it was in Russia.
Right.
And,
uh,

255
00:14:57.761 --> 00:15:00.290
it's a question I have for all you fucking race fans out there.

256
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:05.291
Can somebody explain to me like botox is winning the fucking race,

257
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.660
you know,
and then like,
you know,
cause Lewis Hamilton,
you know,

258
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:12.381
wants to fuck,

259
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:17.210
he's in second and in federal is in third and Hamilton has a lead.

260
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:17.901
But if he,
if he,

261
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:22.901
if he gets in first then it'll have a 50 point fucking lead and Rosberg is his

262
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:23.440
teammates.

263
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.380
So the team asks Rosberg to get out of the way so Lewis will can pass him.

264
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.560
And then his job is just basically then to be a con to v basically race against

265
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:38.900
Sebastian Vettel to keep the Ferrari team destiny.
I mean he basically,
you know,

266
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.160
for all extensive purposes,

267
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:44.590
he pretty much wrapped up the fucking thing unless he crashes or something.

268
00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:45.470
Federal comes in first,

269
00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:48.590
but even then he would only cut his league and half and he's like,

270
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.220
Hamilton always makes the fucking podium.
So,
um,

271
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.740
I get the whole team mate thing,

272
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:59.741
but I remember when fucking him and Nico Rosberg we're going at it two years ago

273
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.040
and the team asked Louis to fucking move to the side.
He's like,
Nah,
I'm good,

274
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.190
I'm good.
And I'm sitting there like going,
all right,

275
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.420
is that because the way he's made up,
he's a champion.

276
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.860
That's what makes him a champion.
Should botox spend like,
Nah,
Nah,

277
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:17.360
I'm fucking good.
I'm good.

278
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.740
Was Louis in a position because he's such a star to say no,

279
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:26.570
I'm good to the fucking team and botox isn't yet.

280
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.100
But through the guy was like fucking,
I mean these guys,
this is what they do.

281
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:32.330
They fucking race.

282
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.510
It goes against everything in their fucking nature to do that.

283
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.820
And they had a race.
Louis is just like a,
yeah,
a Terry,
he was,

284
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.560
he was a gentleman out there today,
blah blah.
I wanted somebody be like,

285
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.380
Hey Louis,
if you had done that for him,

286
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.740
I don't think you would have.
Um,
anyways,

287
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.870
Max for staff and got driver of the day.
You had like fucking three penalties.

288
00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:58.760
He started way in the back and just within five laps was up to like fifth or

289
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:02.160
sixth place.
It was like watching fucking stroke or race.

290
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.810
And when you watch your movies,
like nobody can pass people that,

291
00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:06.980
it doesn't happen like that in a race.
If you started in 19 ticket,

292
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.540
the whole fucking race to get up to the front sky and five laps gave everybody

293
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:12.670
the old right,
they're friends.

294
00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:17.671
So I got my DVR set for that and I'm backing with the Moto GP and I'm very

295
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:21.620
excited to uh,
be watching that shit.
I just got all this,
these run,

296
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.260
run a dates right up until,
uh,

297
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.890
the Chicago theater and then old Billy boys year is done.

298
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:33.200
I fucking year is done.
I got a couple of fucking,
whatever I got to promote.

299
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.920
F is for family season three whenever we get the date.

300
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:39.320
And we'd be doing that towards the end of the year.
So I will be kind of,

301
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.960
it never ends.
It's basically what I'm saying.

302
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:45.170
I'll be flying around fucking promoting the show,
but I won't be doing like show.

303
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.970
So my,
my year ends with the Chicago theater right after MSG,

304
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.990
Madison Square Garden.
Um,
then that's it.

305
00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.890
Hopefully I'll be watching the patriots and fucking first place and the AFC
east.

306
00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.420
Huge,
huge fucking,

307
00:17:59.421 --> 00:18:02.750
when do you realize that we lost just today we would be three games behind the

308
00:18:02.751 --> 00:18:03.430
dolphins,

309
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.430
essentially making planes to try to get the wildcard that look like,

310
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:13.810
like the Patriots team that I've been spoiled to watch every week.

311
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.980
Um,
we got a short week though,
and I don't think Edelman's back on Thursday,

312
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:20.900
so we'll see.
We shall see.

313
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.620
And I was so polling for the fucking Cleveland Browns to get two wins in a row

314
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.470
by like the Raiders through.
So it was Kinda cool,
but I just,

315
00:18:27.471 --> 00:18:31.400
I just wanted to see,
you know,
I dunno,
I've already just,

316
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.940
I've already mentally dealt with the fact that Brady's not going to be here in a

317
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.680
couple of years and all these young kids that I see a coming up,

318
00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:41.150
we're going to be the next ones.
And,
uh,
so I don't want to hate on him,

319
00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:44.300
so I'm just fucking rooting for him even though I know we're going to go right

320
00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:46.910
in the fucking shit.
The second Tom,

321
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:51.530
Tommy fucking leaves the Goddamn facility.
Um,
oh,

322
00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:52.041
by the way,

323
00:18:52.041 --> 00:18:56.780
did I fucking call the NFC south or did I call it fucking told you?

324
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.780
There's no defense in that entire division.

325
00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:02.780
Look what happened when they played the fucking bears.
Who had a defense?

326
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.490
What the fuck was this score?
It was like 48.
That's fucking seven.

327
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.250
Let's see here.
NFL scores.
What do we got here?
What do we got here?

328
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:14.970
<v 2>Okay,</v>

329
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.460
<v 0>of course you got every goddamn score except that one.</v>

330
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.680
What do you guys like tonight?
The chiefs of the Broncos,

331
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.380
I would take the Broncos and the points,

332
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.940
cause they'll division rivalry games are always close and everyone's going to be

333
00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:32.990
all about the,
Oh my God,
the,
that Ma my home or whatever the fuck his name is.

334
00:19:32.991 --> 00:19:37.640
This guy's a juggernaut.
He's due to have a bad game,
right?
He's a rookie.

335
00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:41.780
It'll happen bucking it.
I mean a bucket needs the fucking Broncos.

336
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.420
They play the chiefs twice a year,
then they're not afraid.

337
00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:48.080
These fucking assholes.
I would take them in the points.

338
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.600
<v 2>Okay,</v>

339
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.070
<v 0>von Miller will be a fucking pain in that guy side.
Uh,</v>

340
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.390
that's what I would do.
But Versie what?

341
00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.800
Versus going to go to the game and he's going to Barry,

342
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.070
he's gonna bury the fucking chiefs.
Who knows?
We'll see who's right out.

343
00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:05.730
The score was 48 to 10 pairs.
Um,

344
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:09.520
and I was also right about the Yankees after we swept them all.
Yeah,

345
00:20:09.521 --> 00:20:12.670
it's fucking over the red.
The Yankees is still a year away.

346
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.520
Red sox are looking like they're going to win the world series.

347
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.080
Now look what happens.
Send Chris Sale,
can't get fucking healthy price.

348
00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:21.370
Can't beat the fucking Yankees.

349
00:20:21.371 --> 00:20:25.840
The Yankees Win for the next fucking six and they're one winner today.

350
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.960
They went today,
they,
I think they play the red sox and then they go,

351
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.190
it's like when you watch Friday the 13th,

352
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.820
they always fucking knocked Jason down and they'd hack on one fucking time and

353
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:38.970
then he always get back up.
You got to finish him off.

354
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:44.280
It ain't over until it's over.
So we shall see.
But I'm telling you,
my call is,

355
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.020
I think the Indians and the Astros,
um,

356
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.120
Terry Francona scares the shit out of me.

357
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.980
And when I saw the Astros win the first two games against the red sox and they

358
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:59.410
had a chance,
they came like they were winning and then we,

359
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.650
I think we rallied and we were ahead and then all of a sudden,

360
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:04.900
right at the end of the game,
they had a chance of sweeping us.

361
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:08.430
And when in that last game they were all up on the top step of the Dugout,

362
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.230
the whole fucking dug out.
We're all standing up there like,

363
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:13.390
let's sweep their fucking acids.
And I think,
I think the,

364
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.750
I think they're feeling a little disrespected out there.
Um,

365
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.550
so we shall see.
Have I said one funny fucking thing,
this entire thing.

366
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:24.430
I just been like giving out information.

Yay My bookie show.
Watch football is fun,

415
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.610
but it's more entertaining.
When you got a little action on the Games,
guys,

416
00:24:23.611 --> 00:24:27.570
you've heard me talking about this for weeks and some of you are still on the

417
00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:32.040
sidelines with the junk tucked between your thighs,

418
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.510
whether you're an expert or a rookie,
you should be betting at my bookie.

419
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.780
If you're the kind of guy that likes to bed a little and when a lot like playing

420
00:24:41.941 --> 00:24:45.610
the numbers on the bond roulette,
you can create a big parlay.

421
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.750
Pick three teams to win,
and if you hit all three,

422
00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.040
you'll turn a hundred dollars into $600 it's not just football.

423
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.410
You can bet all major sports.

424
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:58.630
You could bet on what time your wife's going to start complaining,

425
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.910
not take MMA this weekend.
Oh my God.

I,
I actually,

522
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:13.370
I'm following a couple of people now.
Um,

523
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:17.110

526
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.490
I,
I,
I can't,
I can't even,

527
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:33.640
like this person basically

528
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.020
was a stunning,
beautiful blonde,

529
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:43.380
white woman and she was talking about how difficult it was to look the way she

530
00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:47.530
does.
She compared yourself to like a mermaid.

531
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.090
Like that's what she looked like.

532
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.590
Then she did all this other stuff,
you know,

533
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:57.860
so she wouldn't be so pretty and get all this fucking attention.
Um,

534
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:03.250
and I'm not saying like,
you know,
I'm not talking about creepy guy behavior.

535
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.980
I'm just people looking at it or whatever.
She's fucking stunning.

536
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.320
You know what I mean?
And it's just like,
well look,

537
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:10.620
if you're never going to wait in a line in life,
I mean there's the,
there's,

538
00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.360
there's like a price to pay,
you know?

539
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.380
Does that make any fucking sense?
I mean,

540
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.620
I get this fucking thing where it's just like,

541
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.240
<v 2>okay,</v>

542
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.390
<v 0>there's so many fucking problems in the world right now.</v>

543
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.390
It wants to someone like that.
And I'm not talking about me too shit.

544
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:30.140
I'm just saying this person is just fucking not even talking about like me too

545
00:32:30.141 --> 00:32:30.441
shit.

546
00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:34.520
It's just somehow making all of this me too shit about just as an excuse to talk

547
00:32:34.521 --> 00:32:38.870
about how fucking beautiful she is basically,
and how difficult it is.
You know?

548
00:32:38.871 --> 00:32:43.170
It's like you,
you fucking should travel a little bit.
Get outside this country,

549
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.703
<v 1>you know,</v>

550
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.490
<v 0>go find the people that actually are making our clothing and see what their life</v>

551
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:52.720
is.
And then tell me how fucking difficult your fucking life is.

552
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.473
<v 1>You know?</v>

553
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.100
<v 0>And if we're going to focus on anything in this country,
why don't,
well,</v>

554
00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:01.100
how about this next.
Okay.
Other than cleaning up all the fucking pollution.

555
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.070
What about,
you know how you bite into an apple and there's a seed?

556
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:05.060
If you plant in the ground,

557
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:08.450
it won't fucking grow anymore because some company made sure it would.

558
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.823
<v 1>You know</v>

559
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.870
<v 0>so many noted the fucking goddamn food.</v>

560
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.453
<v 1>It's unbelievable</v>

561
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.650
<v 0>that a fucking Pete,
you know,</v>

562
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.670
not a fucking people about stamps.com everybody would.

563
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.840
I walked down the street.

564
00:33:23.841 --> 00:33:28.130
It's a beautiful person not having to stand in line getting free drinks.

565
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:29.240
It's really hard.

566
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:30.900
<v 1>Okay?</v>

567
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.350
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Well,
why don't you fucking put your arms behind your back,</v>

568
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.910
put on some red bottom shoes and do a face plant into the fucking sidewalk.
Okay.

569
00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:42.300
I'm sure you won't have any more fucking difficulty with everybody's jaw

570
00:33:42.301 --> 00:33:45.960
dropping when,
well,
maybe they'll depend on how bad you fuck yourself up.

571
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:47.520

Hey guys,

575
00:33:57.361 --> 00:34:00.870
this should be a new fucking segment.
Okay.
Oh,

576
00:34:00.871 --> 00:34:04.470
this is step on the toes of humble bragging though.
I don't want to do that.

577
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.590
Especially because the guy that created that unfortunately passed away and I

578
00:34:07.591 --> 00:34:11.100
don't want to be doing somebody else's bit,
Ooh.
Can't even call me out on it.

579
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:16.100
All right.
But if you guys could just send me like,
I just want to read.

580
00:34:16.890 --> 00:34:17.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

581
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.730
<v 0>The craziest tweet.
The from most self involved,</v>

582
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.420
too angriest,
craziest.
Both liberal and,
and,

583
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.280
and conservative cause everybody's just fucking

584
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.680
<v 1>like freaking out.</v>

585
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.660
<v 0>Somebody wrote the me too.
Movement is getting out of hand now.</v>

586
00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:41.560
It only takes 20 accusers to slightly inconvenience a wealthy man,

587
00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.320
man with unchecked power.
Uh,
that's what I like.

588
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:49.420
How everybody like fudges the numbers.
It's like,
no,
that's not what happened.

589
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.790
That's not what they'll,

590
00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.970
there's been just one person says something and then somebody loses their

591
00:34:54.971 --> 00:34:59.560
fucking career and then it's investigated and then a month later finds out that

592
00:34:59.561 --> 00:35:03.730
it was bullshit.
And then nobody,
everybody who is trashing the person,

593
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.760
nobody issues of fucking apology to the person.

594
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:11.910
And then the person who is innocent as to then fucking try to figure out how to,

595
00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.120
how to get,
you know,
they have to strategize as an innocent person.

596
00:35:16.121 --> 00:35:17.890
How do get back into the fucking business.

597
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:19.743
<v 1>MMM.</v>

598
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.860
<v 0>You know,
but I don't,
I don't want everything just to be trashing me too.
Like,</v>

599
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.040
cause like,
I'll be honest with you.
Okay.
I usually don't say I vote for,

600
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:31.290
I like that Ford woman.
I believe her.
I do.
You know,
again,

601
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.290
this was the big thing for me was the fact that she's been telling this story is

602
00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:39.780
told to a therapist,
she's been,
came forward before against this fucking guy.

603
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.450
I mean,
if this is really just take this guy down,
this has gotta be the,
is,

604
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:48.380
she's like the terminator of like,
you know,
and he's just an m.

605
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.230
I can't understand if he's just guilty or like

606
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.990
he's a guy,
right?

607
00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:58.140
They're going to grab the brass ring and it's going to have his fucking shorts

608
00:35:58.141 --> 00:35:59.100
are getting yanked out.

609
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.990
And I can't tell if he's just fucking wigging out cause I haven't watched any of

610
00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:06.900
it,
but I just read some details.
So my Breely like,

611
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.530
I'm not going to sit down and fucking give myself jury duty.

612
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:11.700
Why the fuck would I do that?

613
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.450
You know?
Oh fucking,
you know,
I'll watch the highlights.

614
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.910
You know,
I saw,
I saw Matt Damon crushing it doing that.

615
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.750
My favorite thing was it came out and they said,
Mr Cavanaugh,
Mr Cavanaugh,

616
00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:29.020
he just goes,
what?

617
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

618
00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:38.420
<v 0>Um,
anyways,
yeah,
he's just like all over the fucking map.</v>

619
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.160
And uh,

620
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.540
it reminds me of the Kennedy Nixon debate and I know that's really a hacky

621
00:36:44.541 --> 00:36:48.770
fucking thing.
And I'm not saying she's coming off like Kennedy,

622
00:36:48.771 --> 00:36:51.680
I'm just saying he's coming off like Nixon won.
Nixon didn't know how to sit.

623
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.910
He had sweat on his forehead and that it's like he's judged like this guy's not

624
00:36:55.911 --> 00:36:58.580
supposed to be a performer.
So,
um,

625
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.180
<v 1>okay.</v>

626
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.940
<v 0>I Dunno.
It's just one of those things.
If the guy's guilty,</v>

627
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.060
I hope they say he's guilty and if he's innocent,

628
00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:09.390
I hope they say he's fucking innocent so he doesn't get screwed over because

629
00:37:09.391 --> 00:37:12.510
that's,
that's what everybody should want here.
You know,

630
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.260
you should just want a guy to go free because you're a guy and you shouldn't

631
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:21.261
just want a guide to get his life burned down because you know you're a woman.

632
00:37:21.811 --> 00:37:25.800
You should,
you know,
it's kind of,
you know,
it's weird.

633
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.620
It's like people are starting to root for this shift the way they root for their

634
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.454
sports team,

635
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.220
where if they have one of their players does a piece of shit move to ask,

636
00:37:34.221 --> 00:37:36.820
it's not that bad.
But then somebody else to od,
this guy's up there.

637
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.920
There are pieces of shit we're not,
you know.
But anyways,

638
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.790
just so there's some sort of fucking humor in it because it really fucked with

639
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:48.090
my attitude for the first 10 minutes of my set Saturday night.

640
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.720
And that's not fair to the people,
you know,
that pain to see a show.

641
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.960
So someday,
yeah,
like yesterday I just started seeing the humor in it.

642
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:01.680
I just started reading them to [inaudible] and I,
and I would just,

643
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.070
I would go,
I just go,
Hey Paul,
like dead serious.

644
00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:07.320
And then I would read the tweet like I was saying it.
Oh wait,

645
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:08.850
doesn't Jimmy Fallon do that?

646
00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.030
Do I have one original fucking idea?
Somebody does that.
Oh No,
you had the,

647
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.920
somebody has people read their,
their fucking hate mail.
Um,
all right,

648
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.150
well now you know why my act as the level that it's at,

649
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.980
because I don't have a fucking original idea.

650
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.570
When are they going to decide with this fucking guy,
by the way,
you know?

651
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:30.443
Then how the fuck are you doing?

652
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.160
Investigation and a God damn week trying to make sure everybody's stories match

653
00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:37.010
up over something from fucking 30 years ago.

654
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.090
<v 1>Um,
I dunno man.</v>

655
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.130
<v 0>I think you just go with your gut.</v>

656
00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:45.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.870
<v 0>As far as just if you're just sitting at home,
but like the fact that like,</v>

658
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.010
<v 1>okay,</v>

659
00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:54.390
<v 0>what's at stake?
That it,
that that's what they're going to base it on.</v>

660
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.880
I think like,
hey,
he fucking seem crazy.

661
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.320
She seemed believable or she seemed coach and uh,

662
00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.260
he seems like a passionate family man,
you know,

663
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.470
I guess that now that doesn't happen when you're going,
when you sit on a jury,

664
00:39:10.471 --> 00:39:15.280
they actually fucking,
they have to prove it.

665
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:17.200
We aren't a of die.
I mean it's fucking nuts.

666
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:20.050
But then we get into corporations and shit,
which you saw with Tom Brady.

667
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:22.570
It's just like,
no.
If we say you're suspended,
you're fucking suspended.

668
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:28.210
Go Fuck Yourself.
Or,
or civil court like that shit.
We're,
Oj gets acquitted.

669
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:33.130
He,
he's,
he's not guilty in a court of law,
but he's guilty in,

670
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:38.240
uh,
what about a civil court?
So it's like,
all right,

671
00:39:38.241 --> 00:39:42.030
you're not going to jail,
but we're taking everything you're out.
You know,

672
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.230
which is crazy to me because now you've got a murderer walking around.

673
00:39:46.231 --> 00:39:47.790
Pissed off that you just took his bed.

674
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.210
Either put them in jail and take all his shit all,
let them go back to his house.

675
00:39:57.211 --> 00:39:59.910
But fuck,
if you're going to,
if you take the guy murdered somebody,

676
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.660
don't take all his shit.
Now he's going to the fucking stories mad again.

677
00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:09.150
So it happened the first time he got mad.
Fuck.
All right.

700
00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.210
Uh,
remembering passwords.

701
00:41:30.211 --> 00:41:31.890
this is something I have a problem with that you know,
something.

702
00:41:31.891 --> 00:41:34.040
I actually had one

703
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.500
<v 3>of the few patient moments in my life and I tried to,</v>

704
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.640
because I don't know my iCloud password.
So I finally,

705
00:41:40.641 --> 00:41:45.500
just after a year of just keep axing that window 90 times,

706
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:48.650
every time I turned on my fucking computer,
um,

707
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.270
I finally went on the Internet and just googled how to,
how to reset it,

708
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.080
which I did.

709
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.830
And I was so excited cause the window finally went away and then I shut off my

710
00:41:57.831 --> 00:42:02.480
computer and then,
you know,
we turned it back on and wants you to re,
um,

711
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:04.430
putting the,
uh,
the fucking password,

712
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:08.770
which I did and now it's not accepting it and I'm right back to square one.

713
00:42:08.771 --> 00:42:10.280
And remember when the first time I typed it in,

714
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:13.310
it didn't work and I did it again and it didn't work.
And as,

715
00:42:13.311 --> 00:42:17.150
as I was hitting sand or whatever,
or Login,

716
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.960
the third time I live,
he said,
my brain built,
don't snap.
Just relax.

717
00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.570
You'll figure it out.
And then it didn't go in.
I went out.
Right.

718
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.970
<v 0>What the fuck fuck about him.
It's every time,</v>

719
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.970
<v 3>every fucking time.
Um,
anyways,
you know,</v>

720
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.960
it's actually helping.

721
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:35.720
My temper is watching everybody losing their is on the Internet.

722
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.980
I'm just sitting there going like,
wow,
that's what I sound like.
Jesus Christ,

723
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.840
my wife's living with this.
I think I'm going to buy her some shoes,

724
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.160
some matching earplugs.

725
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.550
<v 0>Uh,
hey bill.
I was just listening to the latest podcast,</v>

726
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.640
checkout Dash Lane for passwords.

727
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.870
It's easy to use and you can sync it across your computer phones,
et Cetera.

728
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.640
It odd,
it auto populates your username and passwords.
Hope it helps.

729
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.140
That is definitely somebody young who write wrote,
wrote that in,
dude,

730
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.450
why would I,
the purpose of the password is that nobody else knows it.

731
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.900
That's the one they lifelock.

732
00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.520
Lifelock is the funniest fucking thing in the world to me.
Yeah,

733
00:43:22.521 --> 00:43:25.200
give us all your personal fucking information.
Now.

734
00:43:25.201 --> 00:43:28.830
Not only do I have to trust you,
okay,

735
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.860
you at this company have now created a Fort Knox of,

736
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.050
well,
I guess Fort Knox never gets broken into it.
You've created a basic,

737
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:41.610
a giant fucking sack of cash in the walls that everybody's now going to try to

738
00:43:41.611 --> 00:43:45.500
get to.
Why fucking waste my time trying to fucking hack and a cow out here,

739
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.410
a hack and account here.

740
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:51.530
What I can just hack lifelock and get everybody's fucking shit.

741
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.460
Um,
I appreciate you trying to help me out,
but uh,

742
00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.090
I'm going to just continue on,
you know,

743
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.200
I don't know if they're going to hack in,
they're going to hack him,

744
00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:06.600
but I could just never fucking remember my fucking passwords and I don't want to

745
00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:07.434
like

746
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.290
<v 3>have somebody else do it for me.</v>

747
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.890
My brain's already turning to mush enough as it is.
So,

748
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.710
<v 0>but you know,
people,
if you want to check out dash lane,</v>

749
00:44:16.711 --> 00:44:20.970
d a s h l a n e for passwords,
uh,
you are more than welcome.

750
00:44:20.971 --> 00:44:25.710
You can get out there and try that out for yourselves.
Um,
all right,
number two.

751
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:28.770
Hi,
I heard you were struggling with managing passwords.

752
00:44:28.771 --> 00:44:32.250
This is another one I've been using a password called Dash.

753
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.880
Is this like a Reed Dash Lane for awhile?

754
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:42.110
It's really great and creates really good passwords for you for each website and

755
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.600
automatically logs you in there.

756
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:50.850
It has a plugin for various browsers and also an APP for Mac.
Oh,

757
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:55.710
s love it.
Take care.
Yeah,

758
00:44:55.711 --> 00:44:57.690
there's certain things I just don't outsource.

759
00:44:57.691 --> 00:45:01.650
That would be one of them is something I have to check though.
Um,

760
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.690
stem cell.

761
00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:05.733
<v 2>Okay.</v>

762
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:10.050
<v 0>Therapy for hair loss.</v>

763
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.970
Cause I got to tell you something.

764
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.050
I got buddies who have done this for their knees and their fucking shoulders.

765
00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:17.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

766
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:18.803
<v 0>All right.</v>

767
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:22.820
And you know our hands or something like that and they say they feel like a kid

768
00:45:22.821 --> 00:45:26.210
again.
Now if there is literally,

769
00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.160
if this gets to the fucking point,
if this fucking shit works,

770
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.230
I might go over to Eastern Europe.

771
00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:35.780
I swear to God and I'm going to come back with a full head of hair.

772
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.790
How fucking weird would that be?

773
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.940
That would just be fucking bizarre.
Dude.
Look at this shit.

774
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.840
This is why I shaved my head.
Look at this.
Look at the shit show.

775
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.510
I lost so many of these things that they're showing as like solutions to people

776
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:58.650
still look terrible.
Um,
all right,

777
00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.020
let me see here.
Okay.

778
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:06.060
Stem cell therapy for hair cell for hair loss.
Hang on a second.

779
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:10.500
Uh,
reviews,
let's see here.

780
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:13.830
Let's see what they say.
Now you know the people that do it,

781
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.210
they're just flooding it right now.

782
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:17.430
This is like trying to find out like what's actually healthy.

783
00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.170
I try and to learn about uh,

784
00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.160
about Oh hymns.

785
00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:28.870
They reais they fucking see they come up.
Stem cell hair loss,

786
00:46:28.871 --> 00:46:30.430
injections,
do they work?

787
00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.410
I would almost do this just for the goof.

788
00:46:35.411 --> 00:46:38.770
You know how funny it would be if I just came back with a lion's mane of fucking

789
00:46:38.771 --> 00:46:40.990
red hair?
You know,

790
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.910
each of us deserves a truly personal,
this is a fucking,
this is stupid.

791
00:46:45.911 --> 00:46:48.640
Like this is the thing that you cannot get past.

792
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.040
Like how far,
how many pages do I have to go where I can actually,

793
00:46:56.170 --> 00:47:00.340
where I can actually fucking just find an,
an,
an actual honest review.

794
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:06.150
All right.
Oh,W magazine case,
thanks to stem cell therapy.

795
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:11.460
Thinning hair may be a thing of the past.
You know,

796
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:15.240
like back in the day when you got like a fucking boil on your face,

797
00:47:15.241 --> 00:47:17.190
you just had to have it for the rest of your life.

798
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:21.270
Then you started again the walking stick and you got fucking osteoporosis and

799
00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:25.230
you had to go live under a bridge.
Now,
not all of that shit's gone.
Right.

800
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.210
And now I think that hair loss might the same way.
All right.
Call me creature.

801
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:34.120
A habit or just plain boring.
But I've been wearing my hair long by,

802
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.090
who gives a fuck?
What is this?

803
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:41.030
Yeah,
these are all just businesses.

804
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.720
Can I ask you young people a question?

805
00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.550
How do you find the answers on the Internet?
I don't want a answer.
I want,

806
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.810
I want the answer.
A hairy questions.

807
00:47:54.811 --> 00:47:58.660
Stem Cell to cure baldness in 2017.

808
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.030
All right,
this is what I'm going to do

809
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.960
because I think there's a lot of people doing this right now.

810
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.030
I'm going to wait to somebody just fucking,

811
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:11.080
who looks like me to just walk in one day,
you know,

812
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.880
looking like a fucking,

813
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.240
all of a sudden just looking like a rockstar and when that fucking goes down,

814
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.850
I gotta be like,
how do you lay off?

815
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.910
I never liked all that other shit cause they're like Yank and shit from the back

816
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:24.340
and sticking it on top.
But then that's just like,
you know,
does it work?

817
00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:26.470
Does it not work?
Um,

818
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.073
<v 2>okay.</v>

819
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.620
<v 0>But they just go,
just,
you know,
you just sit down.</v>

820
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

821
00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.730
<v 0>They go big bank,
big bank,
boom.
On top of your fucking head,
right?</v>

822
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:35.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

823
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.370
<v 0>Well,
you're just watching her,
I don't know,</v>

824
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:42.130
an episode of fucking a swat or something.
Then you just leave.

825
00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.240
You come back.
You look like you're in the fucking bgs.
I'll wait a minute.

826
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.200
Most of them were bald,
right?
Oh yeah.
They're all both right.

827
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.720
We're all dead.
One of them has her hair plugs.

828
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.673
<v 2>All right.</v>

829
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:59.580
<v 0>They like the Kennedy's of uh,
false settle.
Right.</v>

830
00:48:59.581 --> 00:49:01.770
There's like a million of them and they all could just fucking get up there.

831
00:49:01.771 --> 00:49:06.430
Right.
All right.
Millennial water crisis.
Dear Beantown,

832
00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.220
Billy and your recent Coney and interview.

833
00:49:08.221 --> 00:49:12.270
And this past Thursday you talked about not understanding why millennials freak

834
00:49:12.271 --> 00:49:14.760
out over the water bottle flipping thing.

835
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:19.320
Even with all the great technology we have.
Yes.
Why do you guys freak out?

836
00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:23.550
It's actually not millennials.
It's the,
uh,
the generation after,

837
00:49:23.551 --> 00:49:28.551
which I keep fucking forget I'm 18 years old generation name.

838
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:37.140
Is it?
What is an Alpha?
What is it?
Generation z?

839
00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:41.310
A you motherfucker.
Generations.
Which generation are you?

840
00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.900
I literally looked this up and I already told you guys the fucking answer.

841
00:49:43.901 --> 00:49:47.250
I already forget.
Yeah.
Generation Alpha.
No,

842
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:52.650
2013 to 2025,
sorry.
No,
1995.
Okay.
Generation Z.

843
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:57.400
Alright.
Generation Z.
That's what they are.

844
00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.270
They can't get enough of that fucking water bottle trick.
Yeah.
Why is that?

845
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.830
He says,
or she says,

846
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:07.360
I thought I explained my persec perspective on it as a millennial and I think

847
00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:08.650
you,
okay,
now you're a millennial,
right?

848
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.070
And I think you'd appreciate the humor in it.
All right.

849
00:50:12.071 --> 00:50:15.580
As long as you're 23 to 38,
you're a millennial,
uh,
you,

850
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:20.410
you bringing up the great technology we have is part of the joke.
Oh,
it's a joke.

851
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.180
I'm 26.
Bam.
He nailed it.
And for my entire life,
advertising,

852
00:50:25.181 --> 00:50:26.650
sporting events,
technology,

853
00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:31.651
everything been getting increasingly sold to us as the next big thing or the

854
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:36.400
best thing ever.
Or a once in a lifetime experience.
Um,

855
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.020
it's all just the same shit rehashed,

856
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:41.390
over and over with brighter colors in bigger letters.

857
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:45.110
This year's iPhone is barely better than the last,
but fuck it.

858
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.780
They'll charge a grand more and people will believe it's better.

859
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:52.820
I like this person fucking critical thinking.
It's a fucking lost start here.

860
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:56.390
Uh,
as I'm dropping f bombs all over the place,

861
00:50:56.391 --> 00:50:59.930
so freaking out over a water bottle.
Being flipped is funny.

862
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.950
It's the most simple thing.
There's no fanfare,
no tickets being sold,

863
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:07.340
nothing to advertise.
It's just some someone flipping a water bottle.

864
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:11.060
So let's freak the fuck out if it lands upright.
That'll be funny.

865
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:14.780
That's how I see it.
At least.
That was really informing.
Thank you.

866
00:51:14.781 --> 00:51:17.500
Love the podcast.
Thanks for the hours of free and have tape.

867
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.180
Tainment they mean a lot to me.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right,
thank you.

868
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.950
Well there we go.
I finally got an answer on the Internet.

869
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.570
Um,
okay.
Helicopter scene are got the answer.

870
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.260
I like to think helicopter scene from the Terminator two.
Hey.

871
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.960
Oh Billy 50 year old.
I'm a big fan of the podcast.

872
00:51:35.961 --> 00:51:39.980
F is for family and I especially liked that you're a fan of moto GP.
I,

873
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:41.030
if I can't get enough of it,

874
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.240
even though I missed the last couple of fucking racist because there's a long

875
00:51:44.241 --> 00:51:47.090
story.
We had issues with their TVs also.

876
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:51.620
Thanks for introducing me to tales from the tour bus with Mike Judge.
Oh my God,

877
00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:53.870
you got to watch that show.
It's fucking incredible.

878
00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.930
I'm not really looking for any advice this time.

879
00:51:56.931 --> 00:52:01.760
Just saw this short video with director's commentary link below about the

880
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:05.420
skilled helicopter pilot in Terminator two had thought you might like it.

881
00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:07.530
Anyways,
thanks and have a great weekend.
Yeah,
well we'll,

882
00:52:07.531 --> 00:52:09.200
I'll definitely post the link for that.

883
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:14.180
[inaudible] it said scene in terminator two were the skinny guy,

884
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:17.740
the next level terminator guy.
Um,

885
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.710
he's in a building and then there's like a helicopter hovering next to it.

886
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.810
He basically turns to like sort of this,
uh,

887
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:27.350
sort of like a plasma TV sort of type of liquid.

888
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:32.570
And he just sort of pushes his face into the fucking helicopter.

889
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:36.170
And then he's sitting next to the guy and he tells the guy to jump out and then

890
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:40.520
he starts chasing him down the street.
And,
um,
I think it was,

891
00:52:40.521 --> 00:52:43.340
was it James Cameron and did that movie?
Um,

892
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:47.660
he was talking about being in the helicopter and how they went from like a

893
00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:52.400
thousand feet down to four feet off the fucking ground and like two seconds.

894
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:56.210
And having that feeling of weightlessness,
um,

895
00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:02.390
I was literally like,
stunt flying in helicopters scares the fucking shit.

896
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:06.920
I,
my palms get sweaty when I watch it.
I don't know why,
because with like,

897
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.230
I just did something about the main rotor.

898
00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:11.790
I just feel like you're going to hit something with that and you,

899
00:53:11.791 --> 00:53:14.690
and then you're going to be fucked.
But if someone does it in a plane,

900
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.250
it doesn't freak me out as much.

901
00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.450
Like the plain seems like it's more designed to do that,
you know,

902
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:22.490
even though if he clips something with you when you fucked,

903
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.090
but there's just something about it.
Here's a question for you guys in aviation,

904
00:53:27.091 --> 00:53:30.420
right?
I'm just a fucking weekend warrior,
right?

905
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.830
Who got zero hours this past month?
I would get so busy.
Um,

906
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:40.450
I was watching that Tom Cruise movie that was a great movie where he played this

907
00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:45.030
uh,
this drug smuggler.
It's a long story but they,

908
00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:49.900
the three of them are flying in planes and the DEA was chasing the da had like a

909
00:53:49.901 --> 00:53:54.190
fucking jet and they just had like a twin engine so they were able to fly much

910
00:53:54.191 --> 00:53:56.760
slower.
And so the,
the,

911
00:53:56.830 --> 00:54:00.160
the DEA kept catching up and then would pass them and then loop around,

912
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:04.180
catch up to them and then pass them.
Cause you know,
he couldn't fly slower.

913
00:54:04.181 --> 00:54:08.830
You fall out of the fucking sky.
So eventually the DEA runs out of gas.

914
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.220
It was going to run out of fuel so they have to turn and go back.

915
00:54:12.221 --> 00:54:14.080
So they just basically waited them out.

916
00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:19.660
So the joke is then the three planes are supposed to peel off to the right to go

917
00:54:19.661 --> 00:54:22.690
to the drop where they're going to drop the drugs.
Two of them peel off,

918
00:54:22.691 --> 00:54:25.990
the other one does it and they figure it out.
It's cause the guy fell asleep.

919
00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.430
He had it on autopilot I guess.

920
00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:32.260
So Tom Cruise is trying to fucking wake the guy up,

921
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.580
all right?
He can't wake him up.

922
00:54:35.581 --> 00:54:40.581
So he comes up with his plane and he just ever so slightly just hits his,

923
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.000
his wing,
the guy sleeping wing with his wing.
Right.

924
00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.270
There's no fucking way you can do that.
Correct.

925
00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.010
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

926
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.500
<v 0>You know,
I know I've seen these guys refuel and you know,</v>

927
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:55.350
you kind of bumped into that thing,
but it's made out of like rubber.
Right?

928
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.420
I know I'm sounding like a fucking moron,

929
00:54:57.421 --> 00:55:00.870
but I was looking at that goal and that's not possible weight.
Is it possible?

930
00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:04.680
Is that a true story that the drug smuggler told?
I mean,

931
00:55:04.681 --> 00:55:09.681
I've seen guys in fucking helicopters not check their surrounding areas,

932
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.650
make a turn and the main rotor blade fucking,
uh,

933
00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.100
does a nice trim job is some trees.
And this is what always blows my mind.

934
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.210
These fucking assholes don't immediately set it down and checked if they did any

935
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:22.200
damage to the blade.

936
00:55:22.201 --> 00:55:26.280
They just fucking pull power and they take off like they're the fucking,

937
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:31.410
like there were a landscape or with the most goddamn overhead ever.
Um,

938
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:34.210
<v 2>yeah,</v>

939
00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:36.830
<v 0>I was just like,
why didn't he just yell into the fucking headphones?
I,</v>

940
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:41.180
you mean he did,
but I don't know.
Anyways,
so it's just a question I have.
Uh,

941
00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:44.540
I know halfway through that I just in my head was like,

942
00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:48.110
there's no fucking way you can do that though.
Why would you risk that?

943
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:49.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

944
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:54.000
<v 0>You know,
um,
gal at work had dream about me.</v>

945
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.270
Oh,
here we go.
Jesus Christ.
We've got to red shoot diary here.

946
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.070
Now listen,
if you have a dream about a woman at work,

947
00:56:02.071 --> 00:56:06.450
don't fucking tell you did I don't,
I don't think he could do that anymore.

948
00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:12.200
I have fucking dream about you.
I was laying there,
Roy,

949
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:16.440
he came in and you had your girls out,
right?
All right.
Hey,
Billy dozer,

950
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:22.590
Bill Dozer.
I get,
hey bill dozer.
Okay.
I have a story you may find humorous slash.

951
00:56:22.591 --> 00:56:27.490
Scary.
It concerns a lady I work with.

952
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.980
So I've been talking to this chick for a few days and I know she digs me lots of

953
00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:37.030
touching,
closeness,
Yada,
Yada.
Bullshit.
I like her,
but now,

954
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:39.190
but I'm not,
I'm now concerned.

955
00:56:39.191 --> 00:56:44.191
This morning she told me she had a dream about us dating for five years in

956
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:45.341
addition to this.

957
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:50.320
She claimed I failed to propose to her during those five years.

958
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.190
Oh yeah.
Do this.
This is a open and shut case.
Yeah.

959
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:58.930
Fucking God blessed this woman for being honest.
Dude.
I,
yeah.

960
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:04.510
Walk away slowly,
briskly and anything.

961
00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:07.090
You can do anything you want because you're not in a relationship.
Just anyways,

962
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:10.750
he goes,
now am I wrong for thinking this was completely crazy?

963
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:15.970
It sounded sort of made up,
which made it 10 times worse.
Exactly.
Uh,

964
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:17.920
I like the girl,
but with this statement,

965
00:57:17.921 --> 00:57:22.630
I kind of feel like she wants to keep me in a body bag or some shit.

966
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:26.920
Uh,
there's one fucking thing that I learned in my adult life.

967
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:32.350
It is go with your gut.
Go with your gut.
You know,
something I fucking,

968
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:37.410
like three weeks ago I was talking to this guy and who's on the road?

969
00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:43.990
He's a tour manager for all the
other fucking people.
Right.

970
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:49.860
And he told me one of his clients was that this particular club and this

971
00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:55.270
particular club,
I always had a feeling the club owner was stealing from me,

972
00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:59.240
which is something about his vibe,
you know?
I just,
I just could feel it.
I just,

973
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:02.920
I was like,
this person that doesn't like me or they're fucking stealing from me.

974
00:58:02.921 --> 00:58:07.921
I just was weird and a couple of weeks ago I was talking to the person in that

975
00:58:08.561 --> 00:58:10.450
club owner's name came up.
He said,
yeah,
he goes,

976
00:58:10.451 --> 00:58:14.440
I caught that guy putting another extra row of fucking chairs in there,
blah,

977
00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:16.360
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I was like,
I fucking knew it.

978
00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:20.650
I knew in my gut was literally saying and for the longest time I didn't listen

979
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:20.831
to it.

980
00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:25.030
If your gut is saying this person wants to put you in a body bag or some shit,

981
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:28.360
yeah,
that's,
that's the feeling you're going to go into a relationship with.

982
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.650
Anyways.
I privately consulted some folks we work with about her dream.

983
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:37.810
Probably a bad idea.
Absolutely a bad idea.
Absolutely a bad idea.

984
00:58:37.811 --> 00:58:39.010
If this is a spy movie,

985
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:43.240
like those people are now running for their lives after you get whacked because

986
00:58:43.241 --> 00:58:45.310
they know that they also have the information anyways.

987
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:49.150
And they seem to think she simply an awkward girl.

988
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:53.140
They think I should give her a shot.
This sounds like you talked to women

989
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:56.680
because they're inserting,
because then what happens?

990
00:58:56.681 --> 00:59:01.100
They insert themselves into the fucking situation and you know,
they,

991
00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:05.110
that's just how it is now.
If you asked the fucking guy,
you know,

992
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:10.780
I dunno what we do.
We cock block is what the fuck are we doing?
Um,
it's funny.

993
00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:14.770
Women in courage,
go ahead.
Co Co dater,
dater.
You know,

994
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.230
we fucking cock block.
It's bad.
Anyways,
what do you think bill?
Billy,
but plug,

995
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:25.460
am I too harsh or is she doing her best?
Freddy Kruger impression.
Thanks.
I,
I,

996
00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.030
you go with the gut dude.
You know what I mean?

997
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:31.610
That's going to be the YC your kids.

998
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:33.380
You're gonna have to say that to your kids one day.

999
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.520
What was it like when you first met your mother while she was I met,

1000
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:40.250
met her mother.
Wow.
It was cool.
But,
uh,
then I got the vibe that,
uh,

1001
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:45.260
she wanted to keep me in a body bag of some shit.
You guys want to get ice cream?

1002
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.060
You know?
Fuck that dude.
Fuck that.
I would uh,
go with,

1003
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:53.780
he got plenty of fish in the sea.
Walk away

1004
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:58.610
dated for five years.
And you did,
you didn't propose to me.

1005
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.260
She's already putting pressure on you.

1006
01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:02.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1007
01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.140
<v 0>Um,
I don't know if somebody is putting pressure on her,</v>

1008
01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:08.800
but she's putting pressure on herself,
but like that's her fucking problem.

1009
01:00:08.801 --> 01:00:10.810
That's not your,
but you want that.
You want that in your life.

1010
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1011
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.450
<v 0>Um,
space flight.</v>

1012
01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:16.623
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1013
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:21.090
<v 0>I want to fly like Ego and outer space.</v>

1014
01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:26.160
There's no fucking hair.
Look at my fucking face.
Hey Bill,

1015
01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:31.220
if you could download your consciousness into a computer slash robot in order to

1016
01:00:31.231 --> 01:00:34.200
travel into space,
would you,

1017
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.890
what the fuck did,
I don't know what that means.

1018
01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:44.710
Download by consciousness into a computer slash robot in order to travel into

1019
01:00:44.711 --> 01:00:49.660
space.
Would you know I'm what?
How,
how could I do that?

1020
01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:53.940
Can you do that?
Now you can do that and they can't cure hair loss.
Do.

1021
01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.520
That's the biggest fucking scam ever.
Um,

1022
01:00:56.590 --> 01:01:01.590
I mean the point of moving your consciousness is to live longer and not have the

1023
01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:06.340
survival requirements we normally have like oxygen,
food.

1024
01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:12.040
Oh.
And having to take shits,
you might just need some electricity,

1025
01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.040
which seems easier to produce than oxygen

1026
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.870
and food in a long ass space.
Right?
I don't know.

1027
01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.620
My girlfriend broke up with me like a month ago and I'm drunk.

1028
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:28.480
Just spit balling here.
Wait a minute.

1029
01:01:28.481 --> 01:01:31.630
I got to see if this is like some shit they're working on right now.

1030
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1031
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.150
<v 0>This is how dumb I am.
It's all behind the time I am a technology.</v>

1032
01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.430
Like I'm actually seeing,
can you wait?

1033
01:01:39.431 --> 01:01:43.450
Can you download your consciousness into a fucking appear?
Um,

1034
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.910
what do I look up here?

1035
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:51.260
What fucking list am I going to get put on if I fucking look this up?
Downloading

1036
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.390
consciousness,
mind uploading

1037
01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.870
what enough.
Okay.

1038
01:02:01.871 --> 01:02:05.650
And as a picture says cyborg whole brain

1039
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:11.780
emulation or Wbe,
mind upload or brain upload,

1040
01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.810
sometimes called mind copying.

1041
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.560
Our mind transfer is the hypothetical,
hypothetical,

1042
01:02:17.561 --> 01:02:20.450
futuristic process of scanning the mental state,

1043
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:26.020
including long term memory and self of a particular brain substrate and copy it

1044
01:02:27.351 --> 01:02:29.180
to a computer.
Do you realize,

1045
01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:33.380
do you realize that you could,
um,

1046
01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.140
it first,
okay,
let's just say they could do that.

1047
01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.460
Like they could do that right now.
The dumbest thing to do is to,

1048
01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.920
is to be part of that first wave and do it.

1049
01:02:45.921 --> 01:02:47.930
Don't fucking do it cause you don't know what's going to happen.

1050
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:52.100
And then also very quickly they're going to be like,
well,

1051
01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:57.101
are there some things that I could like maybe just delete some memories.

1052
01:02:57.801 --> 01:02:59.960
Like if you had some chick he could navigate over,

1053
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.650
he could just delete that out of your brain,
you know,

1054
01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.970
or something really fucking humiliating happened to you that caused you to

1055
01:03:09.971 --> 01:03:13.030
become like introverted.
Maybe get rid of that.

1056
01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.650
Maybe he could become a better person.

1057
01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:19.810
Or is it the painful things that make us stronger?

1058
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:21.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1059
01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.910
<v 0>That make us who we are.
When we return,</v>

1060
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.530
we'll be bringing Dr. Joyce brothers in here.
Um,

1061
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.520
I never installed those doctors like Dr. Joyce brothers.

1062
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:34.870
It's like everyday she's on the Hollywood squares.
It's like when a,

1063
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:39.780
what point were you a practicing medicine?
You know,

1064
01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:43.770
celebrity.
I want to,
you know,
that's the last thing I'm gonna look up here.

1065
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.540
History of celebrity.

1066
01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:50.580
Can't fucking spell the word.

1067
01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:55.260
Celebrity psychologists,

1068
01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:02.090
who's the first one?
List of psychologists,

1069
01:04:02.091 --> 01:04:06.230
timelines of psychology,
history of psychology that should have Tom cruise on it.

1070
01:04:06.231 --> 01:04:09.920
Cause he knows,
he knows the whole history of psychology right through.

1071
01:04:09.921 --> 01:04:10.521
He called it.

1072
01:04:10.521 --> 01:04:14.040
He called that Guy Glib and years later you found out that glitch son of a bitch

1073
01:04:14.041 --> 01:04:17.660
had a fucking God damn problem.
Did he?
Uh,

1074
01:04:17.661 --> 01:04:21.260
the breadth of diversity of psychology can be seen by looking at some of the

1075
01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:23.990
plot the fuck.
Just give me the list.
BF,

1076
01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.320
Jean Piaget,
Sigmund Freud.

1077
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.760
These people actually be the most boring looking people I've ever seen in my

1078
01:04:35.761 --> 01:04:39.300
life.
Albert Bandura,
Leon Festinger.

1079
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:42.120
I always felt like doctor Phil look like a corrupt cop,
doesn't he?

1080
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.880
Because he's got a fucking pistol in his shoe.

1081
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:48.180
Then after he accidentally kills you,
he fucking puts it in your hand.

1082
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:52.350
Erick Erickson,
it sounds like a fake name.

1083
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.770
He's got the white hair like Albert Einstein,
the mustache.

1084
01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.000
That was like the smart look back in the day.
Um,

1085
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:07.950
celebrity
therapists,

1086
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:09.743
<v 2>uh,</v>

1087
01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.400
<v 0>this is my last,</v>

1088
01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:20.810
my last attempt to hear what the fuck was Dr. Joyce

1089
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:28.780
brothers
television vice show pioneer.

1090
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:32.350
She was a pioneer.
Oh,
she died 85.

1091
01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:33.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1092
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.700
<v 0>Yeah,
I feel like an asshole.
Why would,
I was really shitting on her.
I liked her,</v>

1093
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.050
you know,
summer vacation after you did you pay broody came home.

1094
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:43.120
She was on a fucking game.
Oh,
she was on in the afternoon.

1095
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.230
Joyce brothers passes away peacefully at her home in New York City on Monday.

1096
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.160
Joyce brothers,
the mother of pop site.
Oh,
pop psychology.

1097
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.670
That's what I want to look up pop.

1098
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:57.640
That's what I kind of just means.
You don't even have to be good at it,
right?

1099
01:05:57.641 --> 01:06:00.760
You just have to be like,
it's like psychologist with personalities.

1100
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:05.800
So she was the first one.

1101
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1102
01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.690
<v 0>Pop psychology personalities.</v>

1103
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.300
How can I get to what the Fuck I want here?

1104
01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:22.740
History of personality psychology.
I use the word personality.

1105
01:06:22.741 --> 01:06:25.740
Snellman to this 10 famous psychologists and they're fucking achievement.

1106
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:27.900
Can Somebody fucking help me out here?

1107
01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.570
Can somebody teach me how to use the Internet?
Yeah,

1108
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:32.310
<v 3>they give up.
No,
I don't give up.</v>

1109
01:06:32.311 --> 01:06:34.290
I'm just going to take a break for the rest of the day.

1110
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.460
I think it will play with my Kiddo and I'm going to fucking Boston this week,

1111
01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:42.960
baby.
I got Springfield on Thursday.
I got to TD bank,

1112
01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:47.550
north fucking garden.
All right.
On Friday.

1113
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.810
And then I'm fucking in Connecticut where I think we're the fucking Hartford

1114
01:06:51.811 --> 01:06:56.370
whalers used to play.
Uh,
this is ridiculous.
How did this happen?

1115
01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.270
How did somebody who flunked every and height,
everything in high school I got,

1116
01:06:59.271 --> 01:07:02.190
I got to get these gigs out of the fucking way before somebody figures it out.

1117
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.850
Thank you to everybody.
Bought all these goddamn tickets.
Um,

1118
01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:10.140
I'm going to eat perfect it fucking workout and be the best,

1119
01:07:10.141 --> 01:07:13.530
most rested shape I can to give you a fucking money's worth because this is a

1120
01:07:13.531 --> 01:07:15.840
really humbling experience.
Like I said,

1121
01:07:15.841 --> 01:07:17.220
I don't know if we'll ever get to do it again.

1122
01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:20.610
So I'm going to get all of it and I will,
and I'll be a,

1123
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.850
I want to post some videos of a,
I'm going to be fucking jam.

1124
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:28.410
And with some friends of mine that I used to fucking play with way back in the

1125
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:29.850
day when I was living outside of Boston,

1126
01:07:29.851 --> 01:07:33.730
when we at the fucking garden playing fucking Ac DC when we were in the forum,

1127
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:37.640
it was so,
you know,
you get together,
Hey,
do you know this song?

1128
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.340
Do you know that song?

1129
01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:43.340
The one that we all fucking came together on was a van Halen eight talking about

1130
01:07:44.041 --> 01:07:46.230
love.
I played that.

1131
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1132
01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:51.510
<v 3>The Alex van Hailu parts in the fucking La Forum.
And I got to tell you,
dude,</v>

1133
01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:55.830
it was fucking the sickest fucking,
I can't even explain it.

1134
01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.040
You just sit in on the drum chair going,

1135
01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:01.740
this is where fucking John Bonham looked out.
This is nuts.
This is fucking nuts.

1136
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:06.780
Uh,
this is where I saw John thing like a fucking year ago.

1137
01:08:06.781 --> 01:08:11.530
Crushing it on the drums.
We've got the fucking red acrylic,
Ludwig set.
Um,

1138
01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:16.040
unbelievable.
So anyways,
that's the podcast.
I will check in you on Thursday.

1139
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.210
Go fuck yourselves.
Go Patch and a,
I'm calling her right now.

1140
01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:23.810
Take the Broncos with the points.
All right.
Now.

1141
01:08:23.811 --> 01:08:28.610
So the decision you need to make is,
okay.
Bill just said what he's going to do.

1142
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.140
All right.
This is like crap.
So I bet on the past or the don't pass line.

1143
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.080
All right.
It's up to you.
So don't fucking wine to me if you lose your money.

1144
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.610
That's what I'm betting.
I'm betting the farm.

1145
01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:40.670
I'm taking the Broncos with the points.
I don't even know the spread.

1146
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:45.590
I can't even name the Bronco's quarterback.
I just know they got fun.
Milla.

1147
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.850
Um,
and I like that.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
