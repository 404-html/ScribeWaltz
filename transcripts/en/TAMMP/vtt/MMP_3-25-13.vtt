00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.570
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr in,

2
00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.670
it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:11.500
March 25th,
2013 just like that.

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.450
It's the end of the third month.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.030
We're almost a quarter of the way through the,
where is it going?

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.380
Um,
I'm sitting downstairs in my,
uh,
I,
you know,

7
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:25.390
I don't even know if it's a room right now.

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.060
I don't know if you can call it a room,
you know.
Ah,

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.940
I'm so fucking sick of this bullshit.

10
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:34.360
I swear to God I'm ready to just give it to the insurance companies and just be

11
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.400
like,
you know what dude?
What do you do?
You want to stick in there?

12
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.420
How recycled toothpicks all mashed together with some Elmers glue.

13
00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:44.890
F fucking stick it in there.
Alright.
You dicks.
Like,

14
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:48.460
I didn't know you were going to do this to me the day I fucking got insurance

15
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:50.410
from you guys.
You know,

16
00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:54.700
we reviewed your policy and we actually found some areas.

17
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.830
They always fucking do that.
God dammit fucking pussy ass insurance adjuster,

18
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:02.560
right?
The guy comes here,
you know,

19
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.820
and he's all fucking smiles and rosy cheeks throwing stripper glitter all over

20
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:08.890
the fucking room air.
We're going to cover everything.

21
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.540
Don't you worry about a law shield?
We're going to plug them beep up,
up to Boopa.

22
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:16.900
[inaudible] right.
And then what happens when the hammer comes down?

23
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.460
Is he looking me in my eye?

24
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.660
Is he standing in my living room with outside air blowing through his fucking

25
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:29.080
hair?
Cause I have no fucking roof.
No.
How does he do it?

26
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.300
He calls me up.
Leaves a fucking message.
That's what he does.

27
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.970
You have to come on over here like Chris fucking kringle he calls up.
Alright.

28
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.650
Like some fucking college age dude who doesn't,
not a breakup with his chick.

29
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.370
So we just does it over the phone.
Right,

30
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.040
because he doesn't want to deal with the waterworks.

31
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.100
You didn't want to see me break down and cry.
You know,

32
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.070
as he tells me that he reviewed my policy and Oh wait a minute,

33
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.120
I'm not as covered as as I thought I was.
You know,

34
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.550
and then he'd see my bottom lip start quivering

35
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.090
and he'd see my shoulders start shaking.
Right?

36
00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.040
He didn't want to be there for that ugly mess.

37
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.280
It's bad enough when a bra starts crying,

38
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.070
forget about a grown man.
Did I just say grown man?

39
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.930
That's one of the expressions.
I can't stay on the motion comedy girl.

40
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:23.470
I'm a grown man.
How many fucking we know we could see it.
You have a beard,

41
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.250
you asshole.
This happened and then this happened and I'm like,
Hey,

42
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:30.770
wait a minute.
You know I'm a grown ass man.

43
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.680
Oh really?
Has nothing to do with comedy.
You know it has to do with the,

44
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.690
you let that's plastic on the downstairs bed.
Why do I have plastic on the bed?

45
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.180
You're probably wondering what's the matter bill?
What'd he have?
Bed Wetter.

46
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.320
Is that what it is?
So the pressure,

47
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:49.970
we're going out on stage starting to get to you.
You starting to Pete,

48
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.550
you starting to Piss the bed?
That kid?
Yeah,

49
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.610
they got this fucking plastic down here cause all the shit was that was in the

50
00:02:55.611 --> 00:03:00.250
other room is now on the fucking bed.
God knows what's in my hockey jerseys

51
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.070
<v 2>here.
Probably some combination of a speced this with some Ma.</v>

52
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.550
You know I was a little dusting of lead paint and um,
you know,

53
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.430
it's overrated.
Fucking worrying about lead paint.

54
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.693
<v 0>Okay.</v>

55
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.320
<v 2>Rich,
really fucking overrated.</v>

56
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.060
All this lead paint fucking removal.
I guess when you're knocking down walls,

57
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:23.830
you don't want to breathe this shit in.
But other than that,

58
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.840
if you got lead paint and your walls,
it's in the walls.

59
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.900
It's fucking in the walls,
man.
What's it gonna do to you?
What's up lead paint?

60
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.180
Fuck you got,
I mean,

61
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.780
what's it gonna do to you?
You can walk around licking your walls.

62
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:44.600
How old are you?
I guess if you have a kid.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
But,

63
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.050
but if you're a grown ass grown ass,
man,

64
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.200
I'm not going to be fucking stick my tongue in my God damn walls,

65
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.130
even though I can stick my head through my fucking con.

66
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.030
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
I'll tell you,

67
00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:05.390
you're really fall out of love with your house when you can see inside the

68
00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:08.690
fucking walls and you just see all this shit that's covered up.

69
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:12.050
You know what I mean?
It's like when you date and some hot broad,

70
00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.730
and you're thinking you're starting to catch feelings.

71
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:16.940
And then there's that one day where she just fucking answers the door and you

72
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:19.430
see what she really looks like.
That right there.

73
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.110
If you still got that tingling your chest,
you love that woman.
All right,

74
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.070
I've got to tell you,
the tingles gone.

75
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.970
Uh,
guys,
I had to work guys.
Oh my God guys.
I just had

76
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.940
another pet peeve of mine people.
Red Dress audience is guys,

77
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.160
guys,
guys,
just listen.
Cibele what do you like?
Oh,
I don't know.

78
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:46.470
Having a fucking wall

79
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.650
in between my rooms.
That's something I enjoy.
Oh,
I'm in a mood,
so whatever.

80
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.290
So this is my deal,
right?
I'm in this fucking mood.

81
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.470
Man's home is his castle,
right?

82
00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:04.160
And mine has a big battering fucking rammed pulse through the God damn thing.

83
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.540
So it's affecting my mood when I go out in public.
All right,
so here's the deal.

84
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.710
Um,
uh,
I had two shows this weekend,

85
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.800
one in Indianapolis and uh,
and to in,

86
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.900
in Minneapolis it was a mini apolis tour that I was on.

87
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.673
<v 0>MMM.</v>

88
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.490
<v 2>And what,
what the fuck did I do?
I know.
So Thursday I'm taking the red eye out.</v>

89
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.140
I did an episode of this show called the crow show starring Necro and that dude

90
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.980
is fucking out of his mind.
He's absolutely hilarious.
Had a great time all day.

91
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.840
You know,
we were shooting in this house that had walls and a roof.
You know,

92
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.320
it was funny,

93
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.340
it was actually where we were shooting was the home of the person who started

94
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:46.390
the cheesecake factory,

95
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.380
which I thought was really funny cause I've trashed that place I think in all

96
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:53.630
three of my specials if I didn't do it.
And all three of my specialists,

97
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.300
I know I didn't at least one.

98
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.240
And I was thinking about it and the other two because I fucking hate that place.

99
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.840
And um,
it is one,
I actually thought that,
uh,

100
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.580
I thought a guy started it right,
but it's actually a lady.

101
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.210
Can you believe that some woman started a restaurant that went,

102
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.040
went national?
I see.
I,

103
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:21.330
I didn't think that they could do stuff like that.
You know,

104
00:06:21.331 --> 00:06:25.590
I thought like when a,
when a woman started a restaurant,
it was just like,

105
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:27.560
you know,
or husband paid for it.
Right.

106
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.110
And it was right down there on main street.
There wasn't making any money,

107
00:06:31.111 --> 00:06:33.360
but it kept her busy,
you know,

108
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.350
and everybody came in and bought her fucking gluten free cupcakes.
You know,

109
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.720
just keep her happy.

110
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.060
No,
this fucking,
you should have seen this goddamn house.
Sting was,

111
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:50.520
it was insane.
And you know what?
You could tell,

112
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.140
you could tell that it was one of many challenges.
The cheesecake factory.

113
00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.640
Do you want just for those of you who aren't in the United States,
okay.

114
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.700
If you sell cheesecake selling cheese,

115
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.810
the amount of fat Fox that are in this country,

116
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.340
okay.
And don't get too cocky.
People in other countries.

117
00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:13.110
I'm coming around to you later.
Okay?

118
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.190
Don't act like you don't have any fucking dirty laundry though.
You're racist.

119
00:07:17.191 --> 00:07:18.420
Fucking soccer fans.

120
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.390
It would see when they painted the fucking crowd and it's,
sorry.

121
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.770
Half the people in the stands have Hitler mustache.
They're the most racist,

122
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.180
ugliest,
fucking white people you've ever seen in your life,
you know?

123
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.700
<v 2>Why do I think they're all white?
You know why?</v>

125
00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:40.990
Because I fucking watched the premiere league every once in a while,
you know,

126
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.010
but I can't keep up with it because they changed.
Did their fucking jerseys.

127
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.910
They don't have colors.
Well they don't stick with them.

128
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.790
You'll have a team that's red and white and then one day they'll show out with

129
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:54.200
like,
like show up with like black,

130
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:58.340
black and yellow jerseys and I got fucking writing all over them all like a

131
00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:03.280
stock car.
I can't find them.
It should just say man United it.

132
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:07.070
You just say Liverpool arsenal.
Just have fucking that.

133
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.200
You guys got everything this.

134
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:12.440
You just run down the fucking pitch with a god Damn Sandwich Board on,

135
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.900
you know,
eat at ames,
mate.
She shuffled fucking pork chop.

136
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.320
Um,
plastic

137
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.420
fucking driving me nuts do it.
I swear to God.
You know,

138
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.350
if anybody wants to pull up my house,
I swear to God.

139
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:30.620
So let me pull up my house right now and often be 40 bucks for it.
I would walk.

140
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.660
It's all yours buddy.
Here's the case.

141
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.800
Kitchen's in the back and I go fuck yourself.
That's it.

142
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.170
Get my socks and underwear.

143
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.380
A couple of tee shirts and some sweatpants and that's it.
I live in my Prius.

144
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.003
<v 0>MMM.</v>

145
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.430
<v 2>So when it yet selling cheesecake
salad,</v>

146
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.870
cheesecake and America is like selling fish and chips and fucking Great Britain.

147
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.441
I mean,

148
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:59.130
do you realize how bad you have to fuck up that dish to not make any God damn

149
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:03.940
money?
It's brilliant.
She sells,
she sees,
she saw the market.

150
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.930
She was sitting there going,
you know,
there's a lot of fed fucks in this country.

151
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.550
What a fat fucks like cake.
MMM.

152
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.160
I actually not,
I swear I'm going to keep an eye on that relationship.

153
00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:18.941
I don't know who she is,

154
00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:22.810
but I swear to God if that fucking piece of shit that she's married too.

155
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:24.520
I love how,
I'm assuming that he's a piece of shit.

156
00:09:24.521 --> 00:09:26.020
Let's just say she married a piece of shit.

157
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.860
If that do goes to divorce her all right.
And he teached,

158
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.360
Ti takes,
you know,

159
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.770
he basically does what every broad does to a fucking rich guy.

160
00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:37.604
I swear to God.

161
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.130
<v 0>Okay,</v>

162
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.630
<v 2>what do you swear to God?
But what are you going to do?</v>

163
00:09:40.631 --> 00:09:42.820
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
You know what,
I will,

164
00:09:42.821 --> 00:09:45.160
I'll probably have a 15 minute bit on that guy

165
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.350
on how horrific it is.
What kind of a man are you that you would do that?

166
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.670
And then secondly,

167
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.210
after all these other men have been going absolutely fucked in the ass and these

168
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:59.900
divorce settlements that you could switch to the other side like that and we can

169
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:02.780
our fucking position,
right?
Cause then they'll have the example.

170
00:10:02.781 --> 00:10:06.580
Well what about the fucking Douche bag?
Who took all the money from the,
uh,
the,

171
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.070
the cheesecake lady,
that cheese cake lady.

172
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.823
<v 0>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.220
<v 2>I pay people like Oreos and like cake.
What if we stuck a both in one?</v>

174
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.180
And what if we had people that we didn't really pay a lot of money.

175
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.050
It was a factory,
just a factory cheesecake.

176
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.560
That really is a really,
uh,
not an appetizing name.
Cheesecake factory.

177
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:35.400
Does that sound like there's any love in that cake?
They just pumping them out.

178
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.300
People were fucking

179
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.910
just dead eyes staring straight ahead getting carpal tunnel cause their job's to

180
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:48.120
put the Cherry on top all fucking day long.
You know,
get Tennis Elbow,

181
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:49.680
putting cherries on top of cakes.

182
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.830
You couldn't even look your dad in the eye after that.
If he had that job,

183
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.680
he looked down at the floor,
you know,

184
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.200
all proud talking about his whole family until he came to you.

185
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.230
And what about Steven?
What Steven doing?
Uh,
yeah,

186
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:05.310
he's got to get a job down the road.
Job Down the road.

187
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.410
What seat was he paving the roads where we Mikey,
you're getting all vague here.

188
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:12.870
What's going on?
And you know,

189
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:17.400
his friends I already knew or he knew that his son put cherries on top of cakes

190
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:21.870
all day.
You know,
and guys at Dixon rather just getting right to it.

191
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:26.871
They got a torch or the guy down the road down the road where down the road at

192
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:28.980
the cheesecake factory.

193
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.590
What does he do?
He put the sprinkles on them.
Come on,
Mikey would just kidding.

194
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.080
No,
no,
that's good.
That's good.
Hey,
it's one of his arms.

195
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:43.380
A lot bigger than the other one could from lifting all those cherries all day

196
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.840
long.

197
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.673
<v 0>Okay.</v>

198
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.170
<v 2>Um,
anyways,
I'm sorry.
I wanted to get to the point of this podcast here.</v>

199
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.760
The point of this podcast is to make you laugh in a fucking whore myself out.

200
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.420
So you'll come out to my shows and I don't think I've been doing a very good
job.

201
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.230
So right now I'm going to be deliberately funny for the next nine seconds.

202
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.240
All right.
No.
All right.
Oh my God,
you guys,
I have to tell you the story.

203
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:12.490
So I'm flying.
So I do what episode of Kroll Show?
Um,

204
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.590
and always working with Nick Kroll.

205
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.020
You're guaranteed you're going to laugh your ass off off fucking deck.

206
00:12:17.021 --> 00:12:19.720
Can I kiss the kids ass?
I fucking love him.
I think he's,

207
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.460
I think he's a fucking genius.
So anyways,
um,

208
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.450
I go,

209
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.460
I go to the airport and I'm taking the redeye taking this 10 55 flight,

210
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:33.500
nine fucking stop.
Cause that's how I do it.

211
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:35.463
<v 3>All right.</v>

212
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.530
<v 2>I'm on a good plane.</v>

213
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.250
Why would I want to get off it and switch and roll the dice and get on another

214
00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:44.590
one?
You know,
let's just fucking get there

215
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.070
when it,
when I drive up to San Francisco,
I don't pull over and fucking,
uh,

216
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.720
Burbank and then get hit new another cup.
We get it bill.
All right,

217
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.790
so I get on the fucking plane,
right?
I use my miles,

218
00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:01.490
bump myself up like a fancy person.
You know,
maybe,

219
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.350
maybe I invented the cheesecake factory.

220
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:05.990
People are thinking and then they see how I'm dressed and I go,
oh no,

221
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.830
he didn't invent the cheesecake factory.
Um,

222
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.910
and I go to go to sit down on my seat and I go to set my bag down.

223
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.300
I was going to set it down right in front of me.

224
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:17.710
And the Nice fellas sit next to me,
he goes,

225
00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:19.000
why don't you stick it in the middle of this room?

226
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.980
And he moved his bag out of the way.
I'm like,
all right,

227
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:22.510
this guy's a solid dude or whatever.

228
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.410
And then all of a sudden the waitress comes by a stewardess,
whatever.

229
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.370
She comes by,
um,
flight attendant,
whatever the fuck you supposed to call them.

230
00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:35.340
She comes up and she,
uh,
could I get you a job with a Drake?
And I was like,
yeah,

231
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.860
can I get out?
I'm,
let me get a water please.
I said,
no.
Ice.
What?

232
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:40.330
However you make it.

233
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.660
Stop acting like it's a fucking Martini.
It's war,
right?

234
00:13:44.661 --> 00:13:46.610
Just give me a water with ice.
Thank you.

235
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.953
<v 3>MMM.</v>

236
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.220
<v 2>And the,
the guy next to me,
he orders it doers.
Neat.
No Way.</v>

237
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.190
No nothing.
Just put it in there.
So they bring our drinks.
All right.

238
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.910
And I'm really thirsty.
So I start sucking mind down and he just throws his back.

239
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:03.451
Like,

240
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:08.310
it's nothing like fucking John Wayne right before he's going to turn around and

241
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:12.300
beat up three guys,
three mustachioed guys in the 1930s.
Right?

242
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.310
So,
um,

243
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.150
I'm just sitting there and everybody's getting on the flight and out and I'm

244
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:22.950
looking around at the passengers,
you know,
fucking doing whatever I'm doing.

245
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:27.300
And all of a sudden the guy next to me,
Mr Doers,
goes to me,
uh,
he goes,
excuse me?

246
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.700
He goes,
are you afraid to fly?

247
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.110
And I looked and I was like,
what?
He goes,
are you afraid to fly?

248
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.910
And I go,
no,
no,
I'm not.
And he goes,

249
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.030
because all right,
but you know,
it's,
he goes,
it's okay.

250
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.940
It's okay to tell me if you're afraid to fly.

251
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.870
And immediately getting,
and I'm like,
no,
I'm not afraid to fly.

252
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.170
And then I'm thinking in my head,
wait,
is he afraid to fly?

253
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.230
And that's why he's drinking the way he just drank.

254
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.860
And now he's hoping that I'm going to be afraid to fly.
So he,
you know,

255
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.160
he just wants to open up.
That's what I'm thinking.
And I go,
Mike,
yeah,

256
00:15:09.161 --> 00:15:14.010
no,
I'm not afraid to fly.
And he won't leave it alone.
He goes,

257
00:15:14.011 --> 00:15:17.340
all right,
cause you know,
you're,
you're,
you're fidgeting,

258
00:15:17.341 --> 00:15:19.380
you're looking around at other passengers.

259
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.320
And I'm sitting there looking at it like,
is this guy fucking serious?
And I go,

260
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.250
now I go,
I'm not afraid to fly.
So now I'm like,
fuck this guy.

261
00:15:29.251 --> 00:15:31.590
I'm not talking this guy for the rest of the flight.
This guy's weird,
man.

262
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.550
It's like 30.

263
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.500
Just get paint the pictures like 32 year old winery in shape,

264
00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:39.150
but like,
why are we white dude,

265
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:44.010
he's got a skully cap on with fucking glasses.
Um,

266
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.660
you know,
and uh,

267
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.323
he goes,
uh,

268
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.840
like there's like a minute of silence and people still getting on the plane.

269
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.570
And then he goes,
hey,
sorry about that.
Sorry.
We just,

270
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.830
we just got off on the wrong foot.
He's like,
my name's So-and-so.
He goes,

271
00:16:01.831 --> 00:16:06.540
what's your name?
And then I'm thinking in my head like,
what's my name?

272
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.650
My name's frank.

273
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.460
I wanted to give them like a f by just some reason I just wanted it's bill.

274
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.770
And he goes,
Oh hey bill.
And he goes,
nice to meet you.

275
00:16:13.771 --> 00:16:18.390
So we shake hands and I'm just looking at,
I don't have any poker face.

276
00:16:18.391 --> 00:16:20.550
I'm looking at the guy like,
what the fuck is your problem?

277
00:16:20.551 --> 00:16:23.520
I'm not even trying to not,
I'm not trying to be pleasant.

278
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.810
I'm already done with this guy.
So then the guy goes,
oh hey bill.
He goes,

279
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.390
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?
Right?

280
00:16:30.391 --> 00:16:32.430
Like he's fucking interrogating me and I,

281
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:33.860
<v 0>okay.</v>

282
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.840
<v 2>I'm like,
is this guy fucking serious?</v>

283
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.400
And I start doing the math in my head going,

284
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:41.390
when is this guy like an air marshal is something.
And I'm like,
no,
he's not.

285
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:44.720
He's fucking slamming bows over here.
Fuck this guy.

286
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.840
So I just go,
I go,
look,
I don't,
I don't have to answer your questions.

287
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.250
That's it.
And I just look straight forward.
He goes,
okay,

288
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.880
now I'm concerned.
Okay,
I am concerned.

289
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:06.460
And I'm looking at them like concerned about what he goes,
you're fidgeting your,

290
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.620
you,
you,
you have issues with other passengers and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

291
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:12.830
He's such a Peyton like,
like this.
Like he's been,
I don't know what the fuck,

292
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:17.570
like psychologically breaking me down.
All right,
so now at this,
by this point,

293
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:22.571
they've closed the fucking the door to the fuselage and we're starting to taxi.

294
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.300
And I just finally look at the guy and I,
and I go,

295
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.700
I go,
you know,
I came up with the five one point.

296
00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:38.510
I literally stick my hand out cause he kept saying I was nervous and I stick my

297
00:17:38.511 --> 00:17:41.900
hand right in front of his face and I hold it level.
Oh,

298
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:45.710
that's what I did the first time.
Yeah.
I hold it level.
I go,
I'm not nervous.

299
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.260
And he goes,
well,
anybody can do that.
And that's when I was like,
fuck this guy.

300
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:52.920
I'm not talking to the guy.
Sorry.
Fuck the story up.
Then Denny Denny came back,

301
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:57.090
got my name.
Now he's going,
why are you going to Indianapolis?
And I find,

302
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:01.950
look at them.
I say,
listen pal,
I'm drinking waters.
You're drinking doers.

303
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.210
Okay,
there's no issue over here.
And then he goes,
it wasn't doers.

304
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:09.720
What she gave me wasn't doers really.
What was it?
Some sort of spy juice,

305
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.300
you fucking jerk off this point.

306
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.100
I want to punch him right through his fucking stupid wirey glasses,
right?

307
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.870
So he's going like,
you're looking around hostels.

308
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.270
And I said something that just ticked him off.
I was just saying,
dude,
I go,

309
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.750
I don't have to answer your questions.
All right,
leave me alone.
And then he goes,

310
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:30.000
uh,
he goes to egos.
He starts going like,
okay,

311
00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:33.720
now I am really concerned right now.
He goes,
why are you going to Indianapolis?

312
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.340
And I just look at him,
you know,
when I stopped doing,

313
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.620
I start doing like this Ryan Gosling,

314
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.120
you know that little smirk that fucking Mona Lisa smile he has is he smirks his

315
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:45.900
way through all this fucking movies.
I do go.
I go full on Ryan Gosling.

316
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:50.070
Now I'm not talking to this guy and I just keep looking at him and I give them

317
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.740
that little half a smirk and I just shake my head.

318
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.910
That's my game now that's,
this is Mike.

319
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.220
It's like if you're going to be a Dick Right now with your fucking delusional

320
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:01.560
authority,
right?
That you're going to like,

321
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:05.050
we're in fucking Guantanamo and you're got to waterboard me,
Huh?

322
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.160
There's no water,
there's no board.
Go Fuck Yourself.

323
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.520
Here's my smart and I'm just going to shake my head at you like you're a fucking

324
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:15.300
pathetic human being.
This is what I'm doing,
right?
And this is the funny thing.

325
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.330
I'm such a Dick.
All they have to say to the guys,
I'm a comedian,

326
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.900
I'm going to do a sold out show there and that would make them back off,

327
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.610
but I'm a dick.
I'm like,
fuck this guy.
I want to see where this is going to.

328
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:31.410
Now he's all fucking amped up and he starts dropping f you see saying the f

329
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:33.000
word.
He sit in and go to funeral.
He goes,

330
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.880
if you don't fucking answer my question right fucking now I'm going to hit that

331
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:38.760
call button was sitting there,
taxi and down the fucking getting in line,

332
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.210
I'm going to fucking hit this fucking button if you blah blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

333
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.470
And I'm just fucking Mona Lisa smile smirking to shaking my head like you are a

334
00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:50.880
fucking retard,
right?
So now he sees saying the f word so much.

335
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.020
The Lei who's sitting in front of me diagonally in front,
right in front of him,

336
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:58.980
turns around and looks at us,
and now my heart's racing.
I'm like,

337
00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:01.560
where's this going?
This is going to be great.

338
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.480
I am a hundred percent fucking innocent.

339
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.510
This guy's drunk and I think he's going to hit that button.

340
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.890
He's going to hit that button.
What's going to happen?
Right?

341
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.550
I want to see what the pilot looks like.
Let's see where the fuck this is going,

342
00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:17.550
right?
So he goes,
if you fuck you,
he starts getting such.

343
00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:19.860
Bring his hand up to the button going,
I'm going to hit that button.

344
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.300
You have to go fucking do it.

345
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.120
I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there smirking and I'm thinking in my head,

346
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:26.580
go ahead and hit the fucking button.
Let's see what happens.

347
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.500
Let's see what happens,
right?
So finally,

348
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.460
now he wants to hit the button and he can't fucking find it and it's an in

349
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:35.190
defense of him.
I couldn't find it either.
I was looking up there.

350
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:37.680
I have one to hit it myself.
Then he finally,

351
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.330
he finally finds it and he hits it right?
And now I'm just like,

352
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:46.550
Holy Shit,
what's going to happen?
And he's sitting there going,
yeah,
Huh,

353
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.150
you want to fucking play this game and you want to fucking play this game?

354
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.740
And I'm surprised.

355
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:54.730
I mean it took like fucking like 30 seconds before a flight attendant,

356
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.900
the one who gave him the booze,
which evidently wasn't booze comes over.

357
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.620
And at this point we're like doing that shit where we're behind the plane,

358
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:04.030
we're almost ready to take off,

359
00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:06.890
like we're pulling up and then stop and pull it up and stopping as planes are

360
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:10.780
taking off.
So she goes,
yeah,
what's the problem over here?
And he goes,
ah,

361
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.870
I'm not comfortable to fly with this guy.
This guy,
he's fidgeting,

362
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.330
he's looking around at other fucking people,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

363
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:17.350
He's doing all this thing right?

364
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.830
And then the stewardess looks at me and I'm just sitting there fucking my little

365
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:21.251
smart,

366
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:24.640
just shaking my head that just looking at this dude just shaking my head like

367
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:27.970
this guy's out of his fucking mind.
I don't say a word.

368
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.190
And this guy goes on and on and on about his fucking psycho babble about how I'm

369
00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:33.280
the security risk.

370
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:39.250
So she goes to,
so she goes,
okay.
Um,

371
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.120
any other passengers?
Have you noticed anything?

372
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:44.970
She talks to everybody first class.
This

373
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.441
is there.

374
00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:54.441
Anybody noticed anything odd about this guy and the lady who was sitting right

375
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:58.240
in front of the dude diagonally from me turns around.
She goes,
yeah,

376
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:02.080
I've been listening to this guy,
bright berating this other passenger.

377
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.760
She's on my side and I haven't said a fucking word.
This is a great,

378
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.980
and I'm just sitting there smirking.

379
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:12.010
Then they'll let students looks to me and I shrugged my shoulders like,

380
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.830
I don't know what to tell you.
It's a finally she said,
sir,

381
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.580
do you have anything to add to this?
And I just said,
look,

382
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:23.530
I'm just a guy trying to go to Indianapolis.
This guy over here,

383
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:26.840
he starts slamming his doors.
I kind of felt like a rat when I said that.
I go,

384
00:22:26.841 --> 00:22:29.830
he's slamming his doors.
Next thing you know,
he's dropping the F bomb to me.

385
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:33.490
Then I'm thinking,
oh fuck.
I just said bomb.
Right.

386
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.270
Fortunately nothing happens.
So now another fucking,

387
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.960
the male stewardess comes over right now,
he's going like,
what's going on?

388
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.950
And the captain of the fucking now at this point,
we pulled over in the plane,

389
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:49.951
has stopped 250 people trying to get to Indianapolis and jerk off over here,

390
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:55.780
can't hold his fucking alcohol,
who just watched a person of interest every,

391
00:22:55.781 --> 00:23:00.130
every August.
Evidently I have no fucking idea.
Now the plane is stopped,

392
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.110
is fucking jerk off,

393
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.550
has stopped the plane interrogating a Goddamn comedian.

394
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.570
Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and like he works for the CIA,
right?

395
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.250
So now we're just sitting there,

396
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.400
the captain is upfront in the plane,

397
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.420
like saying to the storage is going basically relaying,

398
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:24.340
do I really have to fucking come back there?

399
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.700
This is the last flight of the night.
Is there really a God damn problem?

400
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.050
And that was the vibe.
And they finally said to the dose,
sit next to me.

401
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.060
Are you going to be okay to fly with him?

402
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.360
And at that point it appeased his fucking ego that he was somehow in control.

403
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:44.350
And he goes like,
you know what?
Okay.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It'll be fine.

404
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.870
It'll be fine.
So they go,
okay.

405
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.710
So now the plane's going again and now we're now,

406
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:54.110
we fucking come around and he's sitting there fucking,

407
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:57.860
he's in my ear and at this point I am lat,
like to fucking laugh.

408
00:23:57.861 --> 00:24:01.670
He had me doing the podcast.
That's what I'm doing.
And he's sitting there going,

409
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:04.960
I,
he goes,
you know what?
I'm glad.
I'm glad you,
I hope you fucking do.

410
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.240
I hope you fucking try something.
I'll be fucking try something.
One more update.

411
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:10.970
I really hope you fucking try something.
And I'm just fucking like,

412
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.350
got busted laughing,
shaking it like what are you going to fucking do to me?

413
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.250
What are you going to do to me?
How are you gonna Punch me in the face?

414
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:23.630
You fucking winery jackass,
but yet fucking glasses on.

415
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.270
You know,
that's a federal offense.

416
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.450
You're going to go to jail if you do that or something.
I don't know what,
right.

417
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.260
So I'm just sitting in fucking laugh at the guy going,
I actually,

418
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:37.670
at one point I put my fucking little eye pillow thing on,
you know,

419
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:42.020
like going to sleep.
I had that out too when the stewardess was talking to me.

420
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:44.510
I was like putting it on is this total mind fuck.

421
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.540
Like I don't know what this guy is.
I'm just trying to go to Indianapolis.

422
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:51.080
I'm going to sleep.
And um,
so I got,

423
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:55.340
I got my fucking eye thing on,
right as he's sitting there threatening me,

424
00:24:55.341 --> 00:24:57.740
just I was going and total passive aggressive.
It's like,
dude,

425
00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:02.160
I'm so not concerned with you.
I'm literally putting a blindfold on.
All right,

426
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:08.080
so this fucking guy,
he starts going,
he goes,

427
00:25:08.081 --> 00:25:10.750
yeah.
He goes,
you think you're fucking one this shitty fucking won this.
He goes,

428
00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:13.090
my,
you know,
my dad is my dad.
He started saying his dad,

429
00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:16.840
some major CEO in Indianapolis doesn't sound like a fucking made up story.

430
00:25:16.841 --> 00:25:19.780
I swear to God,
this is all true.
He Goes,
Mike,
my dad is some,

431
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.860
a major CEO in Indianapolis and I'll have you fucking arrested.

432
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.300
And The lady turns around again.

433
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.540
How have you fucking rested the second weekend on the ground?
I'm thinking like,

434
00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:32.230
for what?
For what?
Sitting here,

435
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.300
you fucking loser.
Learn how to hold your alcohol.
All right.

436
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.210
And he starts describing the view that I'm going to have when I go to jail,

437
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:43.360
like some fucking law and order episode.
Oh,
you're gonna love it.

438
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.310
You'll be able to see Lucas oil field and bothered by the bar.

439
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.500
And I'm just sitting there cracking up laughing and then there's this pause,

440
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:55.270
right?
And I'm thinking finally he finally shut the fuck up.
It's like a three,

441
00:25:55.271 --> 00:25:58.330
four minute pause.
He finally just gave up because I wasn't giving him anything.

442
00:25:58.331 --> 00:26:02.020
I was just laughing and shaking my head.
I was being a dick to them.

443
00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:03.520
I was cause I was enjoying it.

444
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.460
And then there was like a three minute pause and then all of a sudden he just

445
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:10.120
goes,
why are you doing the Indianapolis Bill?

446
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.870
So we're like 20 minutes into the flight
and am I going to be honest,
he's,

447
00:26:20.871 --> 00:26:25.871
my adrenaline was so going during all of that because I knew I didn't do

448
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:26.901
anything wrong,

449
00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:30.230
but I thought we were literally going to go back and there was going to be

450
00:26:30.231 --> 00:26:32.450
fucking cops there.
And if like,
if,
if,
if,

451
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.960
if the fucking stewardess or the pilot asked me who I am and where I'm going,

452
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.590
I'm going to tell him I respect your authority.
You're just some Jay.
I don't,

453
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.970
you don't have any fucking authority.
I don't have to answer your questions.

454
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.430
It was pro was one of the most

455
00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.340
fun experiences I've ever had with another human being.

456
00:26:55.341 --> 00:26:58.850
Like when somebody thinks that they have power and you know,
they don't,

457
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.800
and all they can do

458
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:01.930
<v 0>okay</v>

459
00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.920
<v 2>is try just keep bluffing and raising their voices,
start cursing at you.</v>

460
00:27:05.921 --> 00:27:07.630
And if you just start laughing at them,

461
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.280
the look on their face is fucking priceless.
So,

462
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.130
<v 0>okay,</v>

463
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.460
<v 2>blessing.
He said,
he said,
why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?
Right.</v>

464
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:21.570
And I fucking started howling,
just fucking holding my stomach,

465
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:22.560
shaking my head

466
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.060
and with my fucking eye pillow thing on right.

467
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.510
And I know I'm going to get a ton of shit that I wear one of those eye,

468
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.910
they're fucking underrated.

469
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.240
Get the one at Brookstone where it's literally a pillow.
I'm telling you,

470
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:39.630
you could fall asleep 12 noon facing the sun.
It's awesome.

471
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.460
So anyways,
like after he asked me what,
what,

472
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:47.190
you know where you're going to bill you liked it was like a 10 minute,

473
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:52.020
like probably 10 minutes had gone by and I can't fucking sleep because it's so

474
00:27:52.021 --> 00:27:55.290
fun and in me,
I can't wait to tell the story.
Every comic I know,

475
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.850
I can't wait to try it on stage to see if it's funny or whatever.
Uh,

476
00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:03.180
so finally I just like,
Oh fuck it.
Maybe I'll just get on my computer and I

477
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:04.820
<v 0>okay</v>

478
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.390
<v 2>bring up my pillow and I like,
I got to look at the guy,</v>

479
00:28:08.391 --> 00:28:11.540
cause I know he's fucking staring at me,
waiting for me to do something right.

480
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.370
So I lifted it up,

481
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.750
I get my fucking Mona Lisa smile going and I look over at the guy and dude,

482
00:28:17.751 --> 00:28:19.640
he is fucking passed out.

483
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.290
He looked like he got shot.

484
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.650
He was sitting there like his head was just hanging straight down and anytime

485
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.190
the plane move like his head was,

486
00:28:32.191 --> 00:28:36.780
I mean he looked like you got knocked out for the rest of the fucking flight.

487
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.660
All fucking uh oh.
What's Matt Damon's character?
Jack Ryan.

488
00:28:42.661 --> 00:28:45.540
Hold fucking Jack Ryan over here.
It's just,

489
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:50.541
you know the sky marshal the fucking booze bag and God knows what else he was

490
00:28:50.941 --> 00:28:55.770
on.
He was just completely out passed out for the rest of the fucking flight.

491
00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.420
And this is why I want you to dick.
I am.
I was having so much fun with this guy.

492
00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:01.890
I start,
I can't sleep.

493
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.880
So I start slamming waters because I want to have to get up and take a piss just

494
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:12.360
to see if this guy's going to freak out because it's security risk is getting
up.

495
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.020
And this is,
the joke was on me.
He never regained consciousness.

496
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.410
And then I really had to take a Piss,
but I'm such a stubborn fuck.

497
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.280
I was holding it because I wanted to make sure he was awake when I got up

498
00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.850
because I was going to give them a little smirk and then I was going to get up.

499
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.650
He hit the call button again.
Um,
but he did,

500
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.580
he didn't wake up till we hit the ground and um,

501
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.210
and it's funny.
Then he woke up and it was like four hours later.

502
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:42.190
So now he had kind of slip off whatever the,
this guy was on.

503
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:43.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

504
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.860
<v 2>And I'm sitting there smart and waiting for the guy to start talking and he</v>

505
00:29:46.861 --> 00:29:49.130
won't look at me and I,
I,

506
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.510
and I think at that point he kind of fucking realize that maybe he got a little,

507
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:55.500
uh,
a little extra little too patriotic.

508
00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.800
So we stop,

509
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.770
we stop at the gate and everything and we're going to get up.

510
00:30:01.771 --> 00:30:03.090
So I grabbed my shit.

511
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:07.020
I get up and I'm just kinda looking at him and he won't look at me.

512
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.210
And then the lady who was sitting in front of me,

513
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.190
I had this big smile on her face.
She goes,
how are you?
She goes,
how you doing?

514
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.360
I don't want good.
I go that I go,
that was an interesting one.

515
00:30:15.361 --> 00:30:18.810
And I said it really loud.
So the guy heard and he didn't say anything,

516
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.470
and this is what he did to try to save face.

517
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.550
His pillow was kind of stuck behind this kind of stuck behind his shoulder and

518
00:30:26.551 --> 00:30:29.850
like a weird place.
So he was frustrated with it.

519
00:30:29.851 --> 00:30:33.750
So he ripped it out from behind him and kind of threw it down on the floor when

520
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:40.260
he tried to do some caveman grunts to try to still have some sort of a,

521
00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.160
I don't know what.
So,
so that was my flight to Indianapolis people.

522
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:51.740
Um,
you know what,
how,
how far into the fucking podcast are we?
That was a long,

523
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.240
that was a long fucking story.

524
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.120
That did not take me a half hour to tell that did it.
Bull Shit.
I was talking,
oh,

525
00:30:58.121 --> 00:30:59.630
I talking about the cheesecake factory lady.

526
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.710
I gotta I gotta do a little advertising here.
Um,

527
00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.850
hold on,
hold on.
Then after the commercial break,

528
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.570
this is what I'm doing cause that's,
we type in my password here.
Um,

529
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.970
I'm going to tell you how I met Burt from sesame street and I did not have a

530
00:31:16.971 --> 00:31:21.350
good experience with him either.
Um,
all right,
here we go.

531
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.700

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.050
And um,

558
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.370
and basically the Egyptian theater is this beautiful place where they have two

559
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:04.730
theaters.
Uh,
they got one big one in one small one.

560
00:33:04.731 --> 00:33:09.290
So I'm in the small one up on the third floor and on the big one is Elmo from

561
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:13.070
sesame street with all like kids,
superstar friends and all that,

562
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:15.080
all the p cookie,
monster,
big bird,
you know,

563
00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:19.880
all the usual k like Ocean's 11 of muppets.
Right.
And um,

564
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.720
so what was really cool was we actually had to walk by there backstage area,

565
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.020
you know,
if you took the stairs before we went upstairs to where we were at.

566
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:30.854
So I went back,

567
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.280
I'm walking by the backstage area and there's Bert standing there and there's

568
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:37.843
the count.

569
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.570
He's sitting like sitting down like the makeup thing and there's big bird and

570
00:33:41.571 --> 00:33:45.110
all these,
all these people that I recognize.
So I take out my cell phone camera,

571
00:33:45.111 --> 00:33:48.140
I'm like,
oh my God,
there they are.
And I'm like fell modem and stuff.

572
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.860
And all of a sudden birch starts waving at me.
They're like,
hey bird,

573
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.590
are you doing,
I love your brother thinking all this stuff,
right?

574
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.580
And he starts walking towards me with his big head and I was like,
oh my God,

575
00:33:58.581 --> 00:33:59.211
he's coming over.

576
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:03.620
I got to get a picture with this guy and all of a sudden birches starts tugging

577
00:34:03.621 --> 00:34:07.070
at the door,
trying to sell,
trying to slam it in my face,

578
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.620
and then he couldn't get it closed.

579
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.960
And then he just walked away shrugging his shoulders and I'm thinking of what

580
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:17.480
the fuck.
But evidently they have a rule.

581
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:20.730
You can't film or take pictures of them because of the little kids see them

582
00:34:20.731 --> 00:34:24.540
without their heads on or if somebody gets out of the big bird costume and they,

583
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.360
they just see it hanging there with nobody in it.

584
00:34:26.361 --> 00:34:28.850
And I guess it's really fucking traumatic.
But,
uh,

585
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:31.790
I got the video of it that we're going to put up on the,
uh,

586
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.090
the Monday morning podcast page.

587
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.480
It's hilarious because now that you know the story,

588
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:42.860
when you see Bert waving at me,
you'll see how I confused his way.
He,

589
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:46.940
I thought he was waving hello,
but he was waving like,
no,
Nah,
Nah,
no,
no,
no,

590
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.340
no photos.
And he k walk it over.
Um,

591
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.930
I actually got nervous with his big head.
I think I say,
holy crap.

592
00:34:56.931 --> 00:34:59.270
When he came up to me,
I couldn't believe how big his fucking head was.

593
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.610
And then he just starts tugging on the door.

594
00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:03.900
But the stopper wouldn't let them close or whatever,
you know,
it is.

595
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.580
That's one of the ones you got to watch the video for that to be funny.

596
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.280
Fucking Burke.
What a cunt.
You know,

597
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.080
I thought that was just his character on the show.

598
00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:16.520
Evidently he's like that offstage to,
um,
all right,

599
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:19.080
let's get on with the podcast here.
Um,
by the way,
people,

600
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:24.110
if I'm going to read the emails for this week and if you'd like to send a,
uh,

601
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.950
an email to the,
uh,
to the Monday morning podcast asks me questions,

602
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:29.250
tell me to go fuck myself.
Uh,

603
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:34.010
the email is bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com and,

604
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:36.830
uh,
whatever,
send it to us and if we like what you wrote,

605
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.530
we do get a lot of them sit.
Don't get offended if we don't get to yours,
but,
um,

606
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.330
you know,
your emails are 50% of this podcast.

607
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:49.750
The other 50% is me running my mouth about my,
my fucking life here.
All right.

608
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.630
First one of the week.
Best man speech.
Dear bill,

609
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.230
I am going to be a best man at my friend's wedding in a few weeks and I am

610
00:35:58.231 --> 00:35:59.910
absolutely shitting myself.

611
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:05.040
What advice could you give to someone who is terrified of public speaking to not

612
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:09.840
make a dick out of myself.
Thank you.
And Go fuck yourself.
All right.

613
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.490
What advice would I give you?
All right dude,
if you're this nervous,

614
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.540
that means you're not going to be good.
All right.

615
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.350
Which means you're not going to want to remember your horrific speech.

616
00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:27.410
So what I would do is just start drinking like heavily.

617
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.720
No,
I'm fucking with you.
Um,
what should you do?

618
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.581
Well,
the thing is,

619
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:39.180
you're so busy focusing on how you don't want to go up there and do it,

620
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:44.100
that that's probably what's causing you to not know what to say.
All right.

621
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.031
I,

622
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:49.950
what I would do if I was you is I would sit down and just write down what you

623
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:54.030
would like to say to your buddy who's getting married.
Like,
if you were at a bar,

624
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.201
what you would want,

625
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:58.860
what you would say to him if there wasn't a bunch of people looking,
you know,

626
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.200
we say,
listen man,
you think it's great if I'm this girl,

627
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:04.920
I'm really happy for you.
You know,
I love you man.

628
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:09.300
Like whatever the fuck you want to say.
And then just have that down.

629
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.880
And this,
this is the bottom line.
Like,

630
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.260
it's just a bunch of indie crowd is just a bunch of individuals.

631
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:21.150
They're not organized.
They're not a union.
You know,
you didn't,

632
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:21.780
uh,
you know,

633
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.050
take the last morsels of food and they just found out that they're all going to

634
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:29.490
starve to death.
You read if you're at a happy event,
everybody's excited.

635
00:37:29.491 --> 00:37:32.100
Everybody wants you to do well.
Do you know,

636
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:36.360
you know what you have to do to yourself to actually not do well in this,

637
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:41.610
this Gig?
It's impossible to fuck it up unless you go out and fuck it up.

638
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.190
All right?
Don't overthink it.

639
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.820
Just say what you'd love to say to the guy.
You know,
it's going to be fine.

640
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.080
But,
uh,
I would try to do it stone sober because you don't,

641
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:59.040
you don't want to be a,
you don't wanna be all slurring and I'll,
you know

642
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.210
this,
this is a pressure gig.
You know why I do it?

643
00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:06.870
Because this is only going to get married once,
hopefully.
So if you fuck this up,

644
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.080
you're really,
you're going to get a nickname out of this.
Are they?

645
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.670
Every time you guys go drink and they're going to fucking talk about how you

646
00:38:11.671 --> 00:38:12.181
fucked it up.

647
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:14.820
So I guess that that's why you're nervous and I probably should have brought

648
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:19.230
that up cause I probably just made you more nervous.
All right.
All right.

649
00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:22.680
You know what?
Fucking stop being a pussy man up.

650
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.880
You've done book reports before,
right?
Just fucking man up.

651
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:31.290
Getting mad at yourself for being such a fucking that.
There's people right now,

652
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.840
they're,
they're,
they're getting tortured around the world.

653
00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:36.010
People who sewed together at like four in

654
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.280
<v 1>the fucking morning,
you know,
and what do you have to do?</v>

655
00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:41.470
You gonna have to give a fucking speech,

656
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:44.800
but how much you liked somebody in front of a bunch of people who want it to go

657
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:48.610
well before you get to go to an open bar and started drinking.
Huh?

658
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.130
This is what makes you nervous.
You sir,
need to grow a Dick.
All right.

659
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:59.050
In a pair of fucking bulls and get the damn job done.
We hear it.

660
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:03.460
The Monday morning podcast.
Believe in you.
Do not disappoint us.
There you go.

661
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:08.140
Now go out in the field and you make me prayer.
You make this school proud.

662
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.140
You make your mommy and daddy perhaps.
Um,
all right,

663
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.050
well paid girlfriend Chili.
Billy Burke,

664
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:21.070
my girlfriend of one year is about to graduate from a major university until you

665
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:22.960
hit the lottery.

666
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:29.430
Very nice and became a type of bioscientist starting out at 80 grand a year.

667
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:32.890
Holy Shit Dude.

668
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.060
Through there should be like ticker tape fallen down around her fucking pussy.

669
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.290
I'm sorry that was disrespectful.
This isn't some girl you just bang.

670
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:47.200
This is your girlfriend.
I'm sorry.
I'm just saying,
dude,
he hit the lottery.

671
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.440
You know,
every time she walks in the house,
it's easy to here,
done that.
I

672
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.390
just march around behind her,
that and that,
uh,

673
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:02.770
my girlfriend and shit.
Uh,
with that type of career and her intelligence,

674
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.870
her salary,
we're only go up from there.

675
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.460
I worked the front desk at a hotel in a small town.

676
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.870
I'm not going to say the state making nowhere near that.
Oh God.
Here we go.

677
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:16.910
Now a bunch of women are getting mad right now.
See that is,

678
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:21.870
see that they just can't handle it.
Their egos cannot have a fucking sex.

679
00:40:21.871 --> 00:40:25.570
That's how I,
um,
this is why you know why that is ladies?

680
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:28.120
Because you're basically doing our job.

681
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.890
What would you do with one day your man came home and he was suddenly sexier

682
00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:37.090
than you and could actually give birth to a baby when you feel fucking useless

683
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:41.980
at that point,
you know,
if a woman is making way more money than you are,
I mean,

684
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:45.370
all she has to do is just go to the gym with you and our bench press you.

685
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:50.020
And then that's it.
I mean,
you're officially not even a man anymore like it.

686
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.930
This isn't really about the woman.
All right?

687
00:40:52.931 --> 00:40:56.860
This is about a guy where it's just like,
okay,

688
00:40:56.861 --> 00:40:59.320
so you're going to provide and you can have the baby,

689
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:03.850
then I might as well be a fucking wooden Indian over here holding cigars because

690
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:08.320
I'm useless.
You know what I mean?
Come on ladies.

691
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:11.440
You know the deal.
Don't you want to feel like you're needed?

692
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.170
You know,
I mean Jesus Christ,
this guy at this point,
he's,

693
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.990
he's a fucking Kardashians.
His job is just to stand there and look good.

694
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.700
So anyways,
he says,

695
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:25.950
I'm a well traveled guy without a college degree and an ambition of larger

696
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:31.480
ambition,
larger than the job market,
but I'm happy.
Well,
there you go,

697
00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:36.160
dude.
You won.
You won.
You didn't waste all your money going to college.

698
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.600
You know,
I think you know,
if,
if he,
if he,
if you major in as a bioscientist,

699
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.910
but what the fuck is she going to do?
Huh.

700
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.300
Helps some corporation come up with some bugs they can spray and some poor

701
00:41:46.301 --> 00:41:48.610
people so they can get the oil in the ground.

702
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.283
<v 3>You know?</v>

703
00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.790
<v 1>Well how are you going to bio science,</v>

704
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.000
scientific arena in it and it doesn't end up being something

705
00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.540
<v 3>evil.
You know,</v>

706
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.000
<v 1>you guys hear that disgusting sound in the background.</v>

707
00:42:03.001 --> 00:42:07.260
Is My dog licking her paws.
She fucking,
she hurt her foot.

708
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:12.960
We've got this God damn cage that's made out of like fucking plutonium that was

709
00:42:12.961 --> 00:42:16.680
supposed to be pitbull proof.
She's such a fucking maniac.

710
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.140
It's like if we just leave her alone in the house,

711
00:42:19.141 --> 00:42:23.280
she freaks out cause she has separation anxiety cause some Douche beat her and

712
00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:26.550
left her by a river.
Right?
So if he leave her alone in here,

713
00:42:26.551 --> 00:42:29.640
she tries to clot to the house and at this point she could cause there's so many

714
00:42:29.641 --> 00:42:31.710
fucking holes in it.
All right,

715
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.580
so we were told to get like one of these little kid,
they call him Cassius.

716
00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:37.350
It's a fucking cage.
You put them in a cage.

717
00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.770
Now they don't feel overwhelmed that they have to protect the whole house is

718
00:42:40.771 --> 00:42:43.080
just this little area,
this thing.
I swear to God,

719
00:42:43.081 --> 00:42:44.790
it's made out of like rebar or something.

720
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:51.000
The other day she ripped a fucking Pete one of the bars off and this is what I'd

721
00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:55.040
love.
She buried it under a bed,
you know,
like she's Tim Robinson,

722
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.210
Shawshank slowly digging a hole and he's got the Marilyn Monroe fucking for

723
00:42:59.211 --> 00:43:03.050
whatever poster it was Rita Hayworth.
Um,
so whatever.

724
00:43:03.051 --> 00:43:05.270
She's over there licking her wounds.
It's funny as hell.

725
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:07.760
I literally carry her down the street,
let her go to the bathroom,

726
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:12.410
and then I bring her back and then I take out the little fucking looks like an

727
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.130
oxy pad.
Like she has acne and I have to wipe down or pause.

728
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.260
It's getting better for everybody.
Feels bad.
She's fine.

729
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:22.490
She's a pitbull fucking maniac.
She so gets into the goal,

730
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:27.320
going to get addie chipping teeth and shit.
She's nuts.
Fucking nuts.

731
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:31.970
But I swear to God,
her work ethic is incredible.
She plays hurt,

732
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:36.740
you know,
just like Jordan.
Um,
anyways,
where,

733
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:40.610
where am I here?
He said,
I do love this girl,
but I don't want to find myself.

734
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:44.120
Three years down the road getting dumped for not being her financial equal.

735
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.550
I'm pretty successful with the ladies.

736
00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:50.180
So it's not like I can't find another female who I can connect with and lead a

737
00:43:50.181 --> 00:43:53.900
happy middle class life.
She has a passion for goats.

738
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:58.100
She wants a farm and I can really see enjoying the farm life.

739
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:02.250
No more shitty boss,
no more a shitty ass hole.

740
00:44:02.251 --> 00:44:06.500
Customer bullshit growing food,
learning trades,
carving out my own way.

741
00:44:06.501 --> 00:44:10.010
I've talked to her about the money thing and she responded by saying,

742
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:12.830
why would you worry about that?
We'll do that was going to be my advice.

743
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:17.690
Just just say that,
you know,
tell her.

744
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.810
And she says she's not worried about it yet until she gets fucking laid off and

745
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:24.080
you're over there wiggling in the corner.
Um,
he said,

746
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:27.950
money is such a small priority to me.
I don't care how much you make,

747
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:30.950
as long as you contribute me making so much,

748
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.980
does it mean I'll have more money?
Just more goats,

749
00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.360
a cleo knock it off,

750
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.660
which I know she truly means right now.
Uh,

751
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.980
but right now she isn't making $100,000 a year living with some Schmo who's

752
00:44:46.981 --> 00:44:50.880
grinding it out for an hourly wage.
Life takes you places you don't expect.

753
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.270
So she may shelf the farm life for a legitimate career,

754
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:55.590
doing whatever she decides,

755
00:44:55.591 --> 00:44:59.970
which would lead me pretty much incapable of contributing a solid share towards

756
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:02.630
the standard of life that she is capable of living all.

757
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.910
If you guys leave your hypothetical farm,
okay,
um,

758
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.460
I would have left already,

759
00:45:08.461 --> 00:45:12.120
but I don't want to prematurely fuck up a great thing just because I'm insecure.

760
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:16.410
Well that's,
you know,
something that's very perceptive.
You know,

761
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.070
dude,
you're not that bad man.
You,
you analyze yourself,

762
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:24.660
you see all your fucking things up,
you know,
and you know what makes you happy.

763
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.840
You're in a great place right now.
Anyways,

764
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:30.960
she's crazy about me and I'm pretty crazy about her,
but I'm a real,

765
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:34.020
but I am a realistic,
real,
a realist.

766
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.860
And logic tells me then a potentially step,

767
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:41.580
just a stepping stone in our very successful future.
Look,
dude,

768
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.460
if she's fucking crazy about you and your,

769
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.230
you saying you're pretty crazy about her,
if you weren't so insecure,

770
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:50.340
I think you'd be crazy about her to,
uh,
you want to ride this one out.
All right.

771
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.500
And,
um,
look,

772
00:45:52.501 --> 00:45:56.130
there's that lady who went the fucking cheesecake factory or her husband and I

773
00:45:56.131 --> 00:46:00.420
guess her husband's an architect.
He did design the house.
All right.

774
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:01.500
That was a bad example.

775
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.030
Listen to,
um,

776
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.540
<v 0>okay.</v>

777
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.840
<v 1>I Dunno.
I like,
well,
here's one for you.</v>

778
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:15.420
What if this relationship would've worked out but your insecurity,

779
00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:17.850
you kicked it to the curb and then fucking,
you know,

780
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.030
15 years later you're in your late thirties.

781
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:22.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

782
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.790
<v 1>Just broke up with somebody else drinking the local IPA.
Just go and like,</v>

783
00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:30.740
you know,
a judge day with,
oh,
I had this beauty back in the day.

784
00:46:30.741 --> 00:46:31.191
Fuck that.

785
00:46:31.191 --> 00:46:34.730
If you've got a beautiful girl and she's crazy about you and your crazy about

786
00:46:34.731 --> 00:46:37.550
her and she's gonna make a great fucking living like,
dude,

787
00:46:37.551 --> 00:46:42.380
women are way more forgiving of that.
Um,
look,

788
00:46:42.381 --> 00:46:46.670
if you get yourself like one of these fucking plastic surgery faced whores from

789
00:46:46.671 --> 00:46:51.260
the,
uh,
these reality shows,
yeah,
that's going to be an issue.
But like,

790
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.120
you know,
as I,
I think women did,

791
00:46:56.121 --> 00:46:59.320
they're very forgiving as long as you're working towards something and you're a

792
00:46:59.321 --> 00:47:03.790
happy guy if you like.
I Dunno when you're dating,

793
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:07.930
it's very hard to find somebody that's happy and you come home and they were in

794
00:47:07.931 --> 00:47:11.290
a good mood and they want to do some fun stuff.
Um,

795
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:16.540
that's kind of way more important than making a fuck load of money,

796
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:17.530
believe it or not.
I mean,

797
00:47:17.531 --> 00:47:21.700
once you can pay your bills and you can eat more money doesn't necessarily make

798
00:47:21.701 --> 00:47:25.350
you happier.
Um,
beyond a certain point.

799
00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.420
I know a lot of people just rolled their fucking eyes,
but I'm just saying like,

800
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:30.470
<v 0>okay,</v>

801
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.210
<v 1>you know,
I don't know that that's a whole,</v>

802
00:47:32.211 --> 00:47:34.880
that's also a whole other conversation about how to use money.

803
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.080
So you're not imprisoning yourself.
I mean,
a lot of fucking people,
more money,

804
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.460
you know,
that dumb song or that dumb analogy.
More money,
more problems.

805
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:45.283
Um,

806
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:46.550
<v 0>okay.</v>

807
00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:47.251
<v 1>You know?
Yeah.</v>

808
00:47:47.251 --> 00:47:51.480
Because you're going down to the fucking titty bar with money hanging out of

809
00:47:51.481 --> 00:47:55.200
your pocket dump and crystal all over a rug in front of people who work in

810
00:47:55.201 --> 00:47:58.620
cubicles.
Well,
hustle on a fucking corner,
you know?

811
00:47:59.440 --> 00:47:59.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

812
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.630
<v 1>And that's how he ended up having lawsuits.
I mean,
you know,</v>

813
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:02.620
you make a fuck load of money,

814
00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:06.910
eventually you're gonna have a lawsuit or something,
but like,
you know,

815
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:11.200
more titty bars,
more problems is really what it is.
Like if you,
if you make a,

816
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.020
you don't have to make that fucking much money.

817
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.410
If you go out and you buy a house that you can afford,

818
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.910
and I don't mean the mortgage.

819
00:48:18.911 --> 00:48:22.930
If you can afford to kick the shit out of the principal,
the principal,

820
00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.400
um,
that's,
that's,
that's the way to go.

821
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.540
Even then they can still fuck with you.
It's,
it's so God damn evil.

822
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.440
The whole fucking thing is evil.
I Dunno.
What did you well,
Geez,

823
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:38.860
that was uplifting,
wasn't it?
Um,
I don't know,
sir.
If you,

824
00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:41.560
if you have some sort of a fucking dream,
I would,
I would,
if,
if you're,

825
00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:44.520
if you're making steps every day working towards that and k and she's,
uh,

826
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.120
she's the person you saying that she is,

827
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.240
she's not going to have a problem with you.
All right.
Don't fuck it up.

828
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:53.410
Stay in it.
All right.
Open.
Yeah.
Hah.
Find Love Buddy.

829
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:58.360
All right.
Okay.
Custody issue in Norway.
Bill,

830
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:02.230
I'm a guy from Norway,
23 years old and have two children.
Oh yeah,

831
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:06.190
they already five foot 10.
Everybody over there is like fucking six,
nine.

832
00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.930
Um,
excuse my writing if it's wrong.
No,
it's not,
dude,
you're,
you're,

833
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.310
you're writing is incredible.

834
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.580
You're writing in a second language and I'm willing to guess that you probably

835
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:19.660
know a little Swedish.
And I know that you guys and you guys can come.

836
00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

837
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.440
<v 1>No,
I think Norwegian was the different,
it's different one,</v>

838
00:49:23.441 --> 00:49:28.240
I think Norway and Denmark,
they can understand each other and then Norway,

839
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:33.070
it gets a little funky.
But whatever.
I'm sure if you are already bilingual,

840
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:37.330
you're probably trilingual.
So,
um,
I'm amazed at that.

841
00:49:37.331 --> 00:49:42.220
So here we go.
I'm not writing into any fucker Norwegian podcast in Norwegian.

842
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.740
Okay.
You Win Sir.
All right,

843
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.750
my problem is that my ex has Jesus Christ.
Dude,
you have lived a life 23,

844
00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:53.740
two kids.
My ex wife lab,
the JJ,
Bryce.
Uh,

845
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.130
my problem is my ex has my two children away from me.

846
00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.830
We had an agreement that we would have them 50,

847
00:49:59.831 --> 00:50:03.220
50 oral agreement of Jesus Christ.

848
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.180
After a little while I lost my job because the company had a rough time with the

849
00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:09.400
economy.
Now wait a minute,

850
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:12.400
I thought you guys economy was great over there cause you had all the oil.

851
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:19.420
Anyways,
he goes,
so they had to cut some costs out from the firm.

852
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.550
So now I live on the money that I get from welfare until I get a new job.

853
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.863
Tough.

854
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

855
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.983
<v 1>Tough marked</v>

856
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:32.070
<v 0>in Norway now.
Too many immigrants taking our jobs.
Yeah.</v>

857
00:50:32.071 --> 00:50:33.990
You know where the immigrants are,
the Swedes.

858
00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:42.360
Look at me.
I'm fucking well traveled.
I know what goes on in the world.

859
00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.640
I got something to add.
Anyways.

860
00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:49.110
My income is a little bit lower than it was before and now I'm struggling paying

861
00:50:49.111 --> 00:50:53.640
our debt from the time,
from the time we lived together.
As a result of that,

862
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:57.090
she says,
I can't see my children before I can pay my debt.

863
00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.990
Oh my God.
What a fucking cunt.

864
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.303
Okay.

865
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:09.240
<v 1>Wow.
Dude.
You know something.
That detail right there.
I see why he got a divorce.</v>

866
00:51:09.241 --> 00:51:09.691
First of all,

867
00:51:09.691 --> 00:51:13.710
congratulations for getting away from that woman just kicking you when you're

868
00:51:13.711 --> 00:51:14.544
down.

869
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

870
00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.620
<v 1>You know,
or maybe she's bitter from the divorce,
but good Lord.
Anyways,</v>

871
00:51:19.621 --> 00:51:20.221
he says to me,

872
00:51:20.221 --> 00:51:23.970
she's punishing the children by not letting them see their father because I lost

873
00:51:23.971 --> 00:51:27.870
my job.
Don't you agree?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

874
00:51:27.871 --> 00:51:30.270
That is 100% fucking selfish.

875
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:35.460
She's using the children as punishment and reward like their,
like their cookies.

876
00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:40.290
They're human beings and they need to see their dad.
And you know,
I imagine a 23,

877
00:51:40.291 --> 00:51:43.500
I'm willing to bet that they're still pretty young.

878
00:51:43.501 --> 00:51:47.490
So they're at a critical point of this psychological development where they
need,

879
00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:52.380
they need a father there as long as the mother [inaudible] where the fuck did I

880
00:51:52.381 --> 00:51:56.430
pull that one from?
You think I had kids?
Um,
anyways,

881
00:51:56.431 --> 00:51:58.650
he says this has nothing to do with the children whatsoever.

882
00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:02.430
This is a problem between her and me.
But that's not the worst part.

883
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.940
This fucking lady is now claiming child support.

884
00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.310
She takes the children away from me,

885
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:13.200
although I am fully capable of having them.

886
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.200
I give them shelter,
food,
clothes,
you name it.

887
00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.370
But still she takes them away and fucking claims child support from me because I

888
00:52:20.371 --> 00:52:24.900
have problems paying out some debt.
Uh,
we had when we were still together.

889
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:28.710
How in the world can I pay child support when I have a hard time paying our
debt?

890
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:29.580
You see,

891
00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:34.140
she's trying to rob me for my money and takes my children too fucking cunt.

892
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.003
Absolutely.

893
00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:39.540
So I've talked to my lawyer and I'm fucking going to court for this shit.

894
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:43.860
You can try as much as you want to break me,
but in fucked me up.

895
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.880
But don't ever take my kids.
Don't ever fuck with my kids.
All right.
I liked this.

896
00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.690
I liked this.
He's going,
it sounds like the beginning of a Stallone movie.

897
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.260
You're a good man and you've been wronged,
but instead of the movies,

898
00:52:56.261 --> 00:52:59.520
you can't take it in your own hands.
You got to get a lawyer.
All right.
Um,

899
00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:04.020
would love it if you could read this in the podcast so everybody can hear it.

900
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:08.160
More things need to come,
come out in the media about this.
Absolutely.

901
00:53:08.161 --> 00:53:12.480
Love your podcast.
Please come to Norway soon and have some shows.
Uh,

902
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:17.320
absolutely.
I was actually talking to,
uh,
the people over.
Um,

903
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.760
I've been talking to some people over there trying to put together some shows.

904
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.340
Um,
it's been a little over a year since I've been there,

905
00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:27.810
so I got a whole new hour stuff.
Um,
I absolutely love going over there.

906
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.510
And this time when I go over,
I think,
uh,

907
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:35.540
maybe I'm gonna stop and Switzerland or France or Italy or something like that.

908
00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:39.510
Maybe Spain on the way back,
you know,

909
00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.190
have a great fucking time.
But yeah,
now more,
more needs to come out about this.

910
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:45.024
Like,

911
00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:48.370
<v 0>okay,</v>

912
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:50.260
<v 1>look,
I understand that she's upset.</v>

913
00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:54.070
Maybe she feels like you didn't hold up your end of the bargain because you,
you,

914
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:58.060
you can't pay what you were paying.
And she finally just said,
fuck this.

915
00:53:58.061 --> 00:53:59.590
But you know,

916
00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.130
the lesson here is you have to get stuff in writing.

917
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.510
If you don't get it in writing,
you're,

918
00:54:04.511 --> 00:54:06.820
you're going to end up in the situation you're in.

919
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.280
You probably still would end up going to court anyways,

920
00:54:09.281 --> 00:54:14.260
but at least you'd have some,
a piece of paper that could,
uh,
back up your,

921
00:54:14.261 --> 00:54:17.740
your verbal agreement.
So a good luck to you,
sir.

922
00:54:17.741 --> 00:54:20.200
I'm sorry you're going through that and um,

923
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:22.543
<v 0>okay.</v>

924
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.320
<v 1>I Dunno.
Is there any way to sit down with her and just lot just say,
listen,</v>

925
00:54:25.321 --> 00:54:27.600
I understand that you're upset with me.
I understand.

926
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.250
You know that me getting laid off is hurting us financially,

927
00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:33.630
but like we can't,

928
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.223
<v 0>you know,</v>

929
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:40.580
<v 1>we can't use the kids.
We have to do what's best for the kids.</v>

930
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:42.800
And it's not good for them to not see their mother or their father.

931
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.570
<v 0>Okay?</v>

932
00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:50.250
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
Hell hath no fury.
Um,
Granola bitches.</v>

933
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.180
Uh,
Bilbo Bergen's,
my wife,

934
00:54:53.181 --> 00:54:58.181
he has gone granola like a mofo since we got married and she's discovered all

935
00:54:58.831 --> 00:55:01.410
natural makeup and hair treatments.

936
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:06.510
She has started washing your hair with baking soda and an oils leaving her hair

937
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:09.810
stringy and ratty,
but according to her feeling good,

938
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:15.960
fell Jesus also,
she stopped shaving her legs,
plucking her eyebrows.

939
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:21.020
She doesn't brush her teeth at night and only showers every other day because

940
00:55:21.571 --> 00:55:24.240
she says it's all good for her skin.

941
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.080
She's not a fatty and is a great person,

942
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:33.380
but when it comes time to throw down in the booth booth duar

943
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:41.670
she smells like a sweaty Hobo and it makes me grit my teeth.
Oh yeah,

944
00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.513
do

945
00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:43.990
<v 0>okay?</v>

946
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:48.880
<v 1>He says,
I'm certainly not a Kong Dong,
but she always gets worn out for sex.</v>

947
00:55:48.881 --> 00:55:52.450
It doesn't recover for days.
This guy's fucking hilarious.

948
00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:57.730
A calm down.
All right.
Needless to say,
even after I tell her she smells crazy,

949
00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.040
she still does all of this.
Oh,

950
00:56:00.041 --> 00:56:05.040
see you're telling her that she smells like a fucking,
oh boy.
I love Hobo.
Hobo.

951
00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:08.590
So better,
so much better than homeless guy.
Hobo.

952
00:56:08.591 --> 00:56:11.290
It's like you smell like fucking the depression.

953
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:15.250
You don't smell like the dust bowl.
Um,

954
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:20.430
I'm on the verge of freaking out and going strictly all hand or Lilly or leaving

955
00:56:21.641 --> 00:56:23.620
it or leaving her it.

956
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:28.450
I'm not sure what to do and I'm sure you can't share it,

957
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:32.530
but any feedback would be great.
Pine away and go fuck yourself.

958
00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.740
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

959
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.843
<v 3>MMM.</v>

960
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.960
<v 1>All right.
This is what I would do.</v>

961
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

962
00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:44.480
<v 1>The next time she wants to have sex,
I'd say,
hang on a second.</v>

963
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:45.380
<v 0>Okay.</v>

964
00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.210
<v 1>No,
first,
this is what I do.
First thing I would do,</v>

965
00:56:47.211 --> 00:56:48.860
I would go down to the hardware store.

966
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:50.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

967
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.260
<v 1>And I would buy as many garden hoses is you needed to connect together from the</v>

968
00:56:55.271 --> 00:56:56.230
side of the house.

969
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:59.480
<v 3>All right.
Um,</v>

970
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.061
<v 1>well,</v>

971
00:57:01.061 --> 00:57:04.860
maybe dad's going to cost you too much money to make your point the next time

972
00:57:04.861 --> 00:57:09.690
she wants to throw down,
just somehow get her outside and say,
yeah,

973
00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.540
hang on a second and just fucking turn the hose on it.

974
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:21.260
Dude,
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.
I,
I don't,
I don't know.

975
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.270
This is a deal breaker.

976
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.390
<v 0>Okay?</v>

977
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:28.280
<v 1>You gotta be like,
Lady,
you fucking,</v>

978
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:34.970
you smell like fucking 2000 BC.
I might as well be fucking you in a cave with a,

979
00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:37.830
with Molly or the woolly mammoth.
Bbds on

980
00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:44.640
you smell like you should be holding a spear.
How else do I put this?

981
00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.553
<v 3>You know,</v>

982
00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:51.010
<v 1>you should be squatting down,
banging a rock on some berries.
That's,</v>

983
00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:55.220
that's what you fucking,
you smell your pussy smells prehistoric.

984
00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.930
Even back in the day,
I'm sure you know,

985
00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.750
even if I smelled the way I smelled Jason,

986
00:58:02.751 --> 00:58:06.530
a saber tooth tiger across the fucking planes,
you know,

987
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:08.030
if you smelled like this,

988
00:58:08.031 --> 00:58:12.710
I would drag you down to some prehistoric river and Dunky when they're like five

989
00:58:12.711 --> 00:58:15.590
fucking times before I bench over a rock.
I'm trying to tell you.

990
00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.090
You fucking smell,

991
00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.640
dude.
This is like,
that's like disgusting.

992
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:23.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

993
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:28.420
<v 1>It is bad.
His guys could smell.
At least our shit can get a little breeze on it.</v>

994
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:32.410
You know,
you don't want a woman's smells stinky pussies.

995
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.800
Like it's like hockey stuff.
It's zipped up in that fucking bag and when she on

996
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.560
she on zips it,
you could smell it from across the room.

997
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.313
<v 3>All right.</v>

998
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.800
<v 1>A guy's fucking smelly junk.
I mean,
that's like a,</v>

999
00:58:47.801 --> 00:58:51.310
that's like old fruit on the table.
Just flies buzzing around and shit.

1000
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:55.600
Still disgusting.
But you know what I mean?
It's not as fucking bad.

1001
00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.513
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1002
00:58:57.570 --> 00:59:00.990
<v 1>Look what's going to smell worse?
A dead body laying on the side of the street.</v>

1003
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:05.970
Oh,
one locked in the trunk.
All right.
If I made my fucking point,
how's it down?

1004
00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:11.090
How's it fucking down?
Dude?
I don't know what to tell you.

1005
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:15.830
I don't know what to tell you.
It's just I,
I,
you know what I would do?

1006
00:59:15.831 --> 00:59:16.700
I would just say,
listen,

1007
00:59:16.701 --> 00:59:19.790
I'm not having sex with you until you wash yourself properly.

1008
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:21.623
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1009
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.370
<v 1>They make all kinds of all natural soaps.</v>

1010
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.640
There's no excuse for the way you smell right now.

1011
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.430
You are a fucking train wreck.
Jesus Christ.

1012
00:59:33.431 --> 00:59:36.610
Why don't you just start shooting drugs while you're at it to add another level

1013
00:59:36.611 --> 00:59:40.650
of ski Venus to this Korean.
Let me show you something.
Look at my deck.

1014
00:59:40.651 --> 00:59:44.040
You see what it's doing?
You see what it's doing right now?
It's not interest.

1015
00:59:44.041 --> 00:59:46.350
It's not finding the floors.
Fascinating.

1016
00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.613
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1017
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:49.680
<v 1>It's depressed right now.</v>

1018
00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:54.950
That's why it appears to be looking at the fine grain of our hardwood floors.

1019
00:59:56.070 --> 01:00:00.870
Look at my Dick.
Look at it.
That's what you do to me.
All right,

1020
01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.570
dude,
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.

1021
01:00:03.571 --> 01:00:06.150
If you got to tell her to fucking Washer God damn ass,

1022
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.660
you know I,
I would just get like,
I would get really passive aggressive.

1023
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.890
I would get one of those little spray bottles and I would have some perfume in

1024
01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:20.780
there and not the all natural kind either.
No,
you don't.
You got to be obnoxious.

1025
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:25.100
You got to get the old school and that has that little pumper on it and just

1026
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:30.800
anytime it don't spray it on or just anytime she walks by,
just spray it.

1027
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:35.420
And when she looks at it,
he'd just be like,
you,
you smell horribly

1028
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:40.990
in that smell is is,
it's getting on the love that I,

1029
01:00:40.991 --> 01:00:44.530
that I have for you in every day.
It's,
it's like,
it's like,

1030
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.090
you know what my love,

1031
01:00:46.091 --> 01:00:48.830
if you could draw it looks like the roof on bill Burt's house.

1032
01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.090
Alright.
Stripper oil.
Hey Man.

1033
01:00:58.091 --> 01:01:01.750
Basically I was in a strip club and rub some oil on the strippers.

1034
01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:06.760
Oh Jesus Christ.
Well,
I hope you would dress like Walter White when you did it.

1035
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:10.960
He goes,
my girlfriend knew I was going and was totally cool about it.

1036
01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:15.280
When I let it slip that I rubbed oil on them,
she went crazy,

1037
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.790
said it was the same as cheating and she can never trust me again.

1038
01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.910
It's clearly not the same as cheating,
but she won't listen to me.

1039
01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.830
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Uh,
this is what you have to understand.

1040
01:01:26.831 --> 01:01:31.680
You know when,
uh,
I understand what she's saying,

1041
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.020
like,
look,
if you're girl was going to go see the fucking a Ding Dong review,

1042
01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:41.110
whatever the fuck they chip and Dales.
Right,
okay.

1043
01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.710
And they were just fucking up there shaking their dicks on the stage and every,

1044
01:01:44.711 --> 01:01:49.630
they're all gone
fucking freaking out.
Whatever the fuck it is they do.

1045
01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.930
Okay.
You could probably get past that,

1046
01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.940
but what if she put some oil on her hand and started grabbing his fucking taught

1047
01:01:57.941 --> 01:02:02.590
little butt cheek there or even worse fucking uh,
grabbed his dick.

1048
01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.500
Gave it a little up down.
Huh?
What would you send me?
Like,

1049
01:02:05.501 --> 01:02:07.720
it's not the same thing.
This is a bunch of people watching.

1050
01:02:07.721 --> 01:02:09.730
There's nothing in a minute.
It's fucking silly.

1051
01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:12.910
You would definitely have a problem with that.
This is what I would say to her.

1052
01:02:12.911 --> 01:02:16.150
I'd say,
listen,
I want to apologize for my behavior.

1053
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:21.090
I wasn't clear where the line was and just say that I actually put myself in

1054
01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:23.820
your position.
If you went to a mail review and did what I did,

1055
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.930
I would be offended too.
I apologize.
What can I do to make it up to you?

1056
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:30.900
Just totally put it on yourself.
I understand what you're saying that it's not,

1057
01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:34.500
it's not cheating,
but it is you putting your hand,
you'll,
you got oiled up hands.

1058
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.020
It's bad enough you putting your hands on some of the girl's ass.

1059
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.820
Your Hands Are All oiled up,

1060
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.670
but you can tell in defense of you,
you can say,
listen,
I sewed,

1061
01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:48.510
didn't think that it was cheating that I told you that I did it.
You know,

1062
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.760
which is probably bad.
Had I known I was cheating,

1063
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:53.820
then I would allied and said I didn't do it then I don't listen to me.

1064
01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:55.700
I'm a fucking moron.
But there,
there,

1065
01:02:55.710 --> 01:03:00.710
there was something worth listening to when there wasn't there at some point.

1066
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.510
Oh Jesus.
And Hour in three fucking minutes and well,

1067
01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:07.530
this was a fun ass podcast from me.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

1082
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:57.420
Um,
so that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.

1083
01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:00.450
I'm trying to see if there was anything else I wanted to talk about.

1084
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.980
I think that was pretty much it.
Uh,
I want to thank everybody by the way.
Um,

1085
01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:10.680
these were exceptionally great crowds this weekend,
um,

1086
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.240
in Indianapolis and Minneapolis is just a whole other level.

1087
01:04:15.241 --> 01:04:20.241
Like I've heard forever that they're one of the great comedy crowds out there

1088
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.080
and um,
you know,
I could never get booked at that,

1089
01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.870
that their comedy club out there,
they just had so many,

1090
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.890
so many going on was so many great comics wanted to play there and I wasn't high

1091
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:34.080
enough on the ladder so I never got to do a club date.

1092
01:04:34.081 --> 01:04:37.440
I did a bunch of college dates,
Duluth,
you know,

1093
01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:38.760
and all these other fucking places.

1094
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.060
I went to the mall of America and I rode the roller coaster by myself.

1095
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:46.800
Um,
just to explore that level of loneliness.
I've been to Minnesota,

1096
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.950
I've been to a vikings game when Randy Moss was still there,

1097
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:53.090
I went to a twins game at the homer dome when they played with,

1098
01:04:53.091 --> 01:04:57.870
when cal Ripken was still playing.
All right.
I went to a wild game.

1099
01:04:57.990 --> 01:05:02.370
I went to the target center and I saw the fucking timble worlds when Kevin

1100
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:04.920
Gannet was still playing there.
I have been to Minnesota,

1101
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:10.410
but I never got to perform in front of adults.
It was always a young adults.

1102
01:05:10.411 --> 01:05:13.560
It was always doing college gigs.
And uh,

1103
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.390
I used to love doing that shit out there.

1104
01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.420
Like when there was times like you'd fly into the city and then you had the

1105
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:23.230
option of jumping on a smaller plane,
like,
you know,

1106
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:27.670
if you land in Omaha and then flying out to grand junction or flying out to

1107
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:32.590
fucking God.
I used to know the names of these obscure places that I went to.

1108
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.780
Um,
I used to do this gig every,

1109
01:05:35.781 --> 01:05:39.550
got a year up to the upper peninsula of Michigan and I used to always drive it.

1110
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.350
I'd fly into Detroit or into Chicago depending on what part of the peninsula was

1111
01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:47.980
on.
And I drove it cause I wanted to see what it looked like,
you know?

1112
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.120
And um,
I know a lot of people like,

1114
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.570
It's still fucking awesome when you get a perspective of how fucking big this

1115
01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:02.890
country is.
And uh,
how many people were,

1116
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.780
how many animals?

1117
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:09.010
I can't imagine what it used to look like before the white man came and fucked

1118
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:12.660

1121
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.110

you know,

1122
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.920
just cause cause white people fucking committed genocide that they're

1123
01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:29.290
automatically the saints.
You know,

1124
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:34.450
like there was no native American date rapist dragging some woman into his TP.

1125
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.780
You know,
