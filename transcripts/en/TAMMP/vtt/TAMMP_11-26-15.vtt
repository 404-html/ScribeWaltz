00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.590
Okay.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.460
Monday morning podcast.
Just before Friday.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.053
<v 2>Nah,</v>

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.060
<v 1>just checking in on you.
What's going on?
It's the day after thanksgiving.</v>

6
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:19.770
I know I'm a day late,
but you know,

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.810
we had to celebrate dia defeated the British yesterday with a big meal.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.240
<v 0>You liked that England.</v>

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.220
<v 1>Remember that when we kicked your ass.
And that's third Thursday in November.</v>

10
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:39.300
All those fucking centuries ago you showed up and you're dumb.

11
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.510
Red Blazers,
right?
Your big stupid hatch.

12
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.560
We hit behind rocks and trees like men,
right?

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:51.390
Picking you off and Crispus addicts walked up.
He said,
I can't tell a lie.

14
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:53.820
I'm the one who pissed in the gravy.
Right.

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.900
And Benedict Arnold at con went up and he fucking slid a meter here.

16
00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.463
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.730
<v 1>right.
Then George Washington walked over to Thomas Jefferson.
He said,
hey,</v>

18
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.670
when you're done,
bang in one ear,
slaves,

19
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.790
why don't you help me kick the fucking British Outta here?

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.160
Thomas said,
okay.
And he put his fucking pirate hat back on,
right?

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.320
And they went out to the Potomac.
George Washington standing up in the boat.

22
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.100
You know,
but ignoring all rules,
rules,
all the rules,

23
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:27.610
a row in a fucking boats sit down your dose.
You're fucking with the ballots.

24
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.650
We get it.
We get it.

25
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.560
We're going to do the heavy lifting and you're going to take the credit because

26
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:35.020
the guy on the bag during the oil paintings going to,

27
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.570
he's going to take more time with you because you're standing up your fucking

28
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:41.320
ego maniac.
At what business it of yours.

29
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.080
Who fucking Thomas Jefferson fucks.

30
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.030
<v 0>Huh?
Do you ever think about dead George to matter?</v>

31
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.420
<v 1>You upset because your wife Martha is,</v>

32
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:56.620
gets a wooden teeth and that's the story of thanksgiving.
Everybody.

33
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.540
What did it really have to do?
It had to do with a,

34
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.320
we were starving to death and then the native Americans,

35
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.010
one of the biggest blunders taught us how to grow food over here.

36
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.410
They should have just let it die off.

37
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.433
<v 0>You know</v>

38
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.840
<v 1>how do it you make Cornif.
Yeah,
I dunno.</v>

39
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.410
Just keep walking and let them freeze to death.

40
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.790
Oh Man.
If they could go back at time,
God damn it.

41
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.030
I don't think there's a native American on a casino in this country that would

42
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.870
say,
you know what,

43
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:35.040
we fucked up when we showed old pale face out of fucking make some food.

44
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.920
God dammit.
That's right up there.
That's right up there with fucking Hitler.

45
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.980
Not going into Paris right now.
He went into Paris.
That's right.

46
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.570
Rather than driving the allies right out into the fucking oh shit.
You fucked up.

47
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.730
He zigged when he should have zagged.

48
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.650
Anyways.
Did you guys have a nice thanksgiving?

49
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.840
<v 3>Do you have a good time?
Do know I ate so much yesterday.
I was so fucking full.</v>

50
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:06.190
I was that level full.
Where's he standing up and sitting down?

51
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.450
Neither one was comfortable,

52
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.950
so I had to keep switching and then leaning against stuff and then it just

53
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:15.640
really thick,
like understanding bulemia going like,
you know what?

54
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.040
I think it would be great to just,
you know,

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.970
walk behind a dumpster right now and let all of this autonomy.
Well,

56
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.840
why was I doing?
Oh my God,
I fucking ate yesterday.

57
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.600
Jesus fucking Christ.

58
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:33.040
I ate so much yesterday that like I passed out at nine 15 not from booze or

59
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.100
anything like that.
It's just from my fucking body being like,
all right dude,

60
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:40.030
we got to deal with this.
We need to shut everything else down.

61
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.280
Nine 16.

62
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.430
I remember this the last time I saw and I woke up at like four in the morning,

63
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.430
not even remotely hungry.
I went on a hike with my dog this morning.

64
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.100
We will hike for like about five,
six miles.
I came back.
I still wasn't hungry.

65
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.920
I just ate because that's what you supposed to do in the morning.

66
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.340
And I got halfway through my breakfast and the pain in my stomach come,

67
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.440
came back like,
dude,
we're still,

68
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.030
we're still dealing with what the fuck you did yesterday.
I hope you happy.

69
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.440
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Um,

70
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.930
Jesus Christ.
I uh,
yeah,
I fucking,

71
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.880
I hate me.
And Nia made a obviously Turkey stuffing,
mashed potatoes,

72
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.730
a Mac and cheese,
Collard Greens,
pies,

73
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.840
cranberry sauce.
Fucking,
oh.

74
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.300
And I had a heaping fucking helping them,
all of it.

75
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.800
And I was drinking light beer from Milla all day.

76
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.620
Never had any hard stuff.
Never really got fucked up.

77
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:46.621
I think I had a glass of wine and then we went over a knee sisters.

78
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.150
That's how we ended it.

79
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.580
And I had that one last piece of Pie and then that was fucking,
that was it.

80
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.650
That was it.
I haven't felt right since.
Um,

81
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.990
but anyways,
to start the day yesterday,
I did do a nice five mile hike.

82
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.230
Banged out a hundred pushups,
45 dips.
Right?

83
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.090
It's,
it's just not even fucking fist.
Not Fuck him.
I mean,

84
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:15.850
when you eat the way I just ate,
I don't give a fuck if I put on some weight,

85
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:18.940
but I'm,
I'm,
I am back on it.
All right.

86
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.120
I hike today.
Gaf.
Fuck you.
I was doing so well.

87
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:29.560
Why did it have to be thanksgiving?
My favorite fucking holiday?
Um,
anyways,

88
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:33.450
you guys watched the football.
Did you sit around and watch dude,

89
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.340
how fucked up is it actually tweeted about this?
How fucked up is it?

90
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.110
Okay that the programming on Thanksgiving,

91
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.850
they have three NFL football games.
All right.
Thanksgiving,

92
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.610
football,
it,
all,
it all goes together.

93
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.310
The cowboys and the lions have been playing on Thanksgiving since,

94
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:55.390
I don't know why cowboys,
at least since the 1960s I would think in the lions,

95
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:57.510
Jesus Christ,
who knows how far back played,

96
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.443
<v 0>right?</v>

97
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.260
<v 3>Their goddamn tradition.
Somewhere along the fucking line,
these,</v>

98
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.550
these fucking assholes,

99
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.090
they show the Macy day parade and the Westminster dog show at the same fucking

100
00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:17.830
time as the football's on.
It's almost like they're trying to cause fights.

101
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.490
You know?
Guess what?
My wife likes to watch,

102
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.110
she can't get enough of that Macy day parade.
She absolutely loves it.

103
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:27.550
And every fucking year I forget,

104
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.950
I got to get home by nine in the morning out here.

105
00:06:29.951 --> 00:06:31.840
Cause that Goddamn parades already can be on.

106
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:34.930
And the first game starts at noon eastern time,
nine my time,

107
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.910
that'd be fucking year.
Not with the dog.
And I'm thinking,
I'm coming home,

108
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.960
I'm going to make myself a couple of eggs,
all the right.

109
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.450
And then I'm going to sit down,
I'm going to watch the football game.

110
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:49.570
And every fucking year I'd come home,
you know Kelly and I'll be JAKKS.

111
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:53.350
We got the fucking Dubbo float.
And of the Goddamn parade is already on.

112
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.820
My wife is in some ridiculously,
I love the holidays mood,

113
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.130
so I can't change the fucking channel.

114
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.633
<v 0>Right.</v>

115
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.380
<v 3>So this is the first time in my life where I've actually had more than one TV.</v>

116
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.660
So I went downstairs this year and I'm thinking,
oh great,

117
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.720
I'll fucking record the thick,
but what does she do?

118
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.420
Come upstairs.
What's the joy?
The holiday together.
And I'm like,

119
00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:25.500
well I want to watch the football.
She goes,
you know,

120
00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:28.980
and she just pouts yeah,
fuck it's next thing you know you're upstairs.
Right.

121
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.180
And people are doing that stupid,
you know,
fucking dance.
I can't stand.

122
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.910
I absolutely fucking hate it.
Is that thing with does it co couple,
right.

123
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.570
They always do this on dancing with the stars when they're,

124
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.530
the two of them are coming towards the camera towards the audience like that

125
00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:50.320
doing that chat,
chat,
chat thing.
Right.

126
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.080
They're not quite cheek to cheek,

127
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.650
but they're facing one another and as they're walking towards you,

128
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.400
they keep switching their legs,
twisting them,
you know?

129
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

130
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.540
<v 3>Like one,
two,
three,
and this side.
Are they one,
two,</v>

131
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:03.970
three on the other side and want to,

132
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.320
they sit there with this ridiculous smile on your face,

133
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.400
like you're supposed to be impressed.
It's that fucking NFL thing.
Well,

134
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:14.180
you'll run through the tires sideways kind of thing or whatever the fuck it is.

135
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:18.320
It's one of those things except they're dancing.
It never goes with the music.

136
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.230
It's just supposed to be visually exciting I guess.

137
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.870
Even though we've all seen it a thousand fucking times.

138
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:28.850
If anybody who's listening to my podcasts indulges in the world of dance and can

139
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:32.570
tell me what that fucking dance move is and then can tell me the,
uh,

140
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.030
the head of the Union of the dance board,

141
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:38.450
if I could write a fucking letter or send an email requesting that,

142
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:41.540
that dance be a,
you know,
why don't we just take,

143
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.240
you can't watch a dance competition with somebody doesn't do that and everybody

144
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:50.080
thinks it's fucking amazing.
That and dipping somebody while they dance.

145
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:54.130
Everybody,
the crowd always goes up,
I guess the greatest fucking thing ever.

146
00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.840
What is that stupid fucking move called?

147
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.950
You know that thing I'm talking about like they,
it's like the exorcist,

148
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.370
you know when they head spins around,

149
00:09:04.371 --> 00:09:06.200
but you're doing it with the bottom part of your body.

150
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.360
Like your torso from your waist up is still facing your partner,
right?

151
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.430
And your legs are underneath the normally and now it's like,
oh wow.

152
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.370
Does she have a double jointed spine that go in the other way?

153
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.263
<v 0>Okay.</v>

154
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.941
<v 3>I don't know me.</v>

155
00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:22.150
Please send me a video that and then I'll retweet it and then I'll see what the

156
00:09:22.151 --> 00:09:25.330
fuck it is.
And by the way,
the pie video,
pie crust video is coming.

157
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.450
I was just going to shoot it on my iPhone and my buddy who helps me out the

158
00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:30.370
podcast,
he goes,
do it.
If we're going to do it,
let's do it right.

159
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.080
We'll shoot it right.
So he gets back today.

160
00:09:32.081 --> 00:09:37.030
So I will be making a pie crust video for all you fucking Christmas cards out

161
00:09:37.031 --> 00:09:40.130
there.
Um,
but anyways,
I hope you guys all had a,

162
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.920
a a nice day despite the fact that I fucking overrate I over ate the way.

163
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.850
Like,
you know,
when you drink so much,
you don't have a good time.
You know,

164
00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:53.170
you start getting a bed spins,
you know,
in the bar,
like that type of shit.

165
00:09:53.171 --> 00:09:57.190
Like I ate to that level and um,
I'd like to say,
Oh,

166
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.360
I'm disgusted with myself,
but it tasted so fucking good.
I'm not.

167
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:04.763
<v 0>MMM.</v>

168
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.680
<v 3>So anyway,
seriously,
I hope you guys all had a happy thanksgiving.</v>

169
00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:11.200
I had a wonderful one and this was the best year of my life,

170
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.580
both personally and professionally.
I,
I dunno,

171
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.020
I just keep having more fun.

172
00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:19.720
Every God damn year it's been working out good for me.
You know,

173
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.140
it's kind of weird.
There's,
the planet is slowly dying.

174
00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:26.710
I just seem to be having more fun with each year.
You think,

175
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:31.711
think what the polar ice caps melting and the food oceans being fished out that

176
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.440
they would affect my mood.
I think,
you know,

177
00:10:35.441 --> 00:10:40.441
it really has helped me to stay positive is I feel like it's inevitable that

178
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:43.270
we're going to destroy ourselves.

179
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.810
So once you just sort of given to that and you're like,
well,

180
00:10:46.811 --> 00:10:50.880
there's nothing I can fucking do about it,
you know,
next thing you know,
you're a,

181
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:52.770
you know,
here are you to having a little pony ride,

182
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.020
you getting on the Ferris wheel,
you know,
you're like,
well,
you know,

183
00:10:57.021 --> 00:10:57.854
when we have some fun,

184
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.840
I'm going to have as much fun as I can have before we fucked this whole thing
up.

185
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.020
And even if we don't,
I mean,
every once in a while,
you know,

186
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.590
an asteroid is going to come by every couple of fucking zillion years.
Right.

187
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.090
I don't want to piss anybody off here like Google did with their,
uh,

188
00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:15.100
their Lucy thing,
which I'd never even heard of.

189
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.340
I guess he found these fucking bones in Ethiopia and it was sort of a half a hap

190
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:22.890
human.
It looked like an eight,

191
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.450
but like somebody you could talk to at the same time,
you know,

192
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.950
the way they flushed it out,

193
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.480
like it didn't look like the fucking like chimpanzees that we all know now eat

194
00:11:31.481 --> 00:11:34.900
other monkeys and rip people's faces off.
If you want to know more about that.

195
00:11:34.901 --> 00:11:35.410
Listen,

196
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.410
I did an episode of the Joe Rogan experience to promote afters for family.

197
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.790
Uh,
Joe Rogan saw the clip of the show and he invited me on the show,

198
00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:49.180
which is,
you know,
twice Joe Rogan.
He's the fucking best.
So anyways,

199
00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:50.080
we talked about that.

200
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.790
Joe told me some fucking horrific story about how this footage of chimpanzees,

201
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.310
you know,
where we start to eat bananas,

202
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:01.930
but they like eat other monkeys and a,
they don't really kill them.

203
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:02.860
They just start eating them.

204
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.440
It's fucking as the other monkeys screams and fucking pain.

205
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:09.820
They just sort of sit there,
you know,
sadistic motherfuckers.
Anyways,

206
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:12.700
what the fuck am I talking about?
I'm talking about Lucy,
right?
Who?
Like I said,

207
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.160
it looks like an eight,
but you feel like you could talk to it.
And,
um,

208
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.660
so they did this little creationism,
I guess,

209
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.520
is it creation is no,
not create creation.
Those,

210
00:12:23.521 --> 00:12:26.290
those are the God people they did.
The more,
uh,
you know,

211
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:30.310
we came from the mud and then we were apes thing with their drawing.

212
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.410
Am I explaining this even remotely?
Right?
You know,

213
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:40.360
when you go on Google,
all right.
And then every day they got something,

214
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:42.040
like if it's Albert Einstein's birthday,

215
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:46.920
they'll spell out Google with like a fucking white afro or some shit.
Um,

216
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.340
they did something for,
uh,
you know,

217
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.050
who is Lucy or whatever.

218
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.030
And they made it like there was a monkey on all fours and then an eight kind of

219
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:03.040
walking on two legs upright and then a man.
And uh,

220
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.300
it said yes,
the Google use one of its signature doodles to come or emirate,

221
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.880
the 41st anniversary of the discovery of Lucy,

222
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.440
the name of a collection of fossils,
you know,
the fucking AP,

223
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.430
you feel like you could talk to blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Uh,

224
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.270
it was a significant moment for our understanding of evolution.

225
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.960
But many creationists weren't happy about Google promoting the theory of

226
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:29.470
evolution on their homepage.
So here's some of the tweets.
Uh,

227
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:33.970
somebody wrote and before any hashtag fossils once lived,

228
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.710
um,
God created the heavens and the earth.

229
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.060
Genesis 1.1,
please remove Lucy from my homepage

230
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.281
for the life of me.

231
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:49.690
I don't understand why people who are into creationism get upset by the stuff.

232
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.080
Like it doesn't make any sense.
You know,

233
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.720
what do you give a fuck what these guys think?
Um,
another one,

234
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.500
since a la parentheses,

235
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:03.310
God and creation have much proofs than evolution.

236
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.070
I expect to see something about it on your homepage.

237
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.610
This is the one that I actually liked to pushing your beliefs on.

238
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:12.880
Others are you Google?
Isn't that what you godless folks?

239
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.510
Object to about Christians?
That's a fucking great.

240
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:18.730
Give it up for Jim Jensen.
Everybody.

241
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:22.690
That's a great one because when you be upset,
if they fucking a,

242
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:27.640
I dunno all these fucking open minded people who,
who want to go with like a,

243
00:14:27.641 --> 00:14:32.110
you know,
the scientific,
you know,

244
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.570
proof of,
of how we got here,
which is,
you know,

245
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:36.580
we're never going to figure it out.
This is the thing,

246
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:39.640
we're never going to figure this shit out because even these people cause like

247
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:42.580
the people who are into God,
I do believe in God,

248
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.330
no matter how far back science goes,
it has to be like,
oh yeah,
I see what you're,

249
00:14:47.331 --> 00:14:50.800
a bunch of Amoebas,
uh,
in the ocean.
Then they just go,
well who,

250
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.190
the Amoebas man.
And no matter how far back you go,

251
00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.970
you go who they go,
well,
who created that right?

252
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.140
Never addressing the fact that there Adam and eve sin doesn't,

253
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.180
as far as what we've found in the ground,
you know,

254
00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:11.910
and how old the bones are and what they say in the Bible.

255
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:15.810
When Adam and eve lived in all this bullshit,
it doesn't even add up.

256
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.250
So then all they do is just no matter what science comes up with,
they go,
well,

257
00:15:20.251 --> 00:15:24.630
who came up with that man?
But can't you do that to the God?

258
00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:29.080
People be like,
all right.
So before there was anything,

259
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.670
there was God.
Okay.
And where did he,
where was he?

260
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.370
If there wasn't anything,
where was he?
And who created that?
And who created him?

261
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.490
He was just here.

262
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.450
It doesn't make it and none of it makes any fucking sense.

263
00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:48.700
And I don't think we're supposed to understand.

264
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.790
We're supposed to continue to move forward,

265
00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:54.220
try to get bigger TVs and destroy one another.

266
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.210
That is our destiny.
All right?

267
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.600
And some people got upset saying that they felt that Google was saying that they

268
00:16:01.601 --> 00:16:06.350
were monkeys.
All right.
Hi.
How are we from monkey?
You believe it.

269
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.980
I don't like how they deliberately take the ones that are misspelled.

270
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.450
First generation should be from Adam,
Adam and eve.
Not Bullshit.
Monkey.

271
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.140
The world is on fire and the moron bubbled dwellers at Google.

272
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.780
Uh,
just help their godless agenda Lib.

273
00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:30.280
Tards um,
I love godless.

274
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:34.970
That's so fucking so fucking great description.
Um,
all right.

275
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.651
And then,
okay,

276
00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:40.651
here's the people who got an pissed off that a Google was implying that they

277
00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:45.330
were monkeys.
All right?
This person writes,
I'm not a fucking monkey.

278
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.430
Maybe white people came from monkeys,

279
00:16:47.431 --> 00:16:52.110
but colored people been native to this planet.
All right,

280
00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:55.770
so your home page is saying all humans came from monkeys.
You have no proof,

281
00:16:55.771 --> 00:16:59.550
just a made up theory to avoid the truth of creation of funny.

282
00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:04.260
Is that as opposed to you what your book that thought the world was flat?

283
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.330
Uh,
I might be bugging,

284
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.420
but is it just me or did Google mock the black race by making a monkey revolve

285
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.200
revolve into a man that's not cool at all?
For,
first of all,

286
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.650
it's evolve and also the man in the photo was white.

287
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.120
I think.
I have no fucking idea.
I just,
I dunno.

288
00:17:25.121 --> 00:17:27.580
I just find an interest in the people get that fucking pissed off.

289
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.500
You know what I mean?
It's like,
why do you give it?

290
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.870
Why do you give a fuck what other people think?

291
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.630
It's not like,
oh,
I guess maybe because it's a control thing.
I Dunno.

292
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.750
I don't,
I don't,
I don't see it.
I don't see it at all.
Uh,

293
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.190
I don't give a shit.
Right?
Is that dumb?
Is that,
is that uh,

294
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.773
my hypocrite?

295
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.750
Am I gonna be in the river Haiti's or whatever the fuck they talk about?

296
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.650
It's another black Friday.
Everybody now that black Friday,

297
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.550
what people who have absolutely no respect for themselves and their own fucking

298
00:18:01.551 --> 00:18:06.551
well big go down to a fucking store to find three BB guns that have been marked

299
00:18:07.281 --> 00:18:10.700
down 80% while everything else is the exact same fucking price.

300
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.090
People,
I say this every year,

301
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.930
get better than this cave.
A little bit of fucking respect for yourself.

302
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.810
All right?
Why don't you stay home today?
Stay home,

303
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.340
chill out,
know,
enjoy the rest of you have Thanksgiving weekend,
you know,

304
00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:31.640
and then next,
next week.
How about Monday night after work?

305
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.860
Why don't you just waltz into the store,

306
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.170
step over the dried blood on the floor from last Friday.
Just step over that.

307
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.770
Walk in there and just buy something that you can afford.
You know,

308
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.690
there's no shame in it.

309
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.890
There's no shame in being fucking like having money problems.

310
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.750
You don't have to get hurt over it.

311
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.980
Just fucking buy something that you can afford and that's it.

312
00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.513
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

313
00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.410
<v 3>it's just shit.</v>

314
00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:01.770
It's stuff like that fucking TV that they say and he used to be a thousand,

315
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.210
now it's only 40 bucks.
You're going to go in there and do like fucking,
you know,

316
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:10.480
five grand with the damage to your limbs trying to get to the thing.
And I,

317
00:19:10.481 --> 00:19:14.220
for one,
it's a flatscreen TVs have people shit,
fucking two years,

318
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.700
two years is probably not even worth for a while.
Maybe it's worth 40 bucks.

319
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.360
I don't know.
Here's my thing.

320
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:25.260
The second is a fucking line and pushing and shoving.
I've always just said,

321
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:28.140
you know what?
Fuck that.
Occasionally I fucked up.

322
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.580
Occasionally I've gone down to like,
uh,
you know,
I dunno.

323
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.740
Pink's hot dogs fucking labrea and stood in that line for 90 minutes to get a

324
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:40.710
fucking hot dog that just tasted like a hot dog.
And I was like,
yeah,

325
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:44.700
there you go.
Bill.
What'd you learn?
What'd you learn?

326
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.250
I'm trying to think what would be worth,
I don't know.

327
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.780
The planet is going to explode

328
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.660
in fucking two hours and then there's a 90 minute line.
I would stand in that,

329
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.390
but then I'm also thinking like,
all right,
so then we're going to be up there.

330
00:19:59.391 --> 00:20:00.620
And what outer space?

331
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.833
<v 2>Wow.</v>

332
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:09.460
<v 3>Booboo.
Booboo.
Right?
It's like 90% fucking men.</v>

333
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.330
You know what black chick up there.
Was there any other fucking women

334
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.940
on Star Trek?

335
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.960
Is that like Kirk always late and am I doing hacky material from the 86 is that

336
00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:22.790
what cook landed and fucking was so horny?

337
00:20:22.791 --> 00:20:26.210
Every place he went fucking them green bitches.

338
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.560
I'm sorry.
Anyway,
so why don't I,

339
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:35.300
why don't I read the one advertiser I seem to have left on this podcast.

340
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.370
They really don't have a sense of humor.
Do they?
All right.
Um,
okay.

341
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.960
What's the name of this fog?
Ziprecruiter's everybody zip recruiter.

342
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.130
As a business,
your company is only

343
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.520
<v 1>as good as the people you hire posting jobs in one place.</v>

344
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:54.010
Well that's not enough to find quality candidates.

345
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.810
Short staffing leaves little time to post to dozens of job sites.

346
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:01.570
So what do you do?
Jesus Christ.

347
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:05.920
Wouldn't it be great if there was a website you could go to post your position

348
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:09.550
and have it go out to a Zillion Goddamn people?
Well,
relax.

349
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.240

Uh,

354
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.070
insert approved user testimony.
Please.

355
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.390
Reference testimonial addendum document.
Well,

356
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:41.980
I didn't do any of that.
Did I?
Uh,
today you can try it.
Look,

357
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:44.320
what the fuck do I got to do that for?
They know what this is.
If I,

358
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:47.680
if I needed to hire some of my business,
I would use it.
This totally makes sense.

359
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.440
Okay.
You got the goods.
They're going to buy it today.

360
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:54.970
You can try ZipRecruiter for free.

That's ziprecruiter.com/burr.
One more hack,

362
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:03.130
ziprecruiter.com/burp.
Um,
oh,

363
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:06.190
I got to hear MVMT watches.

364
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.310
Michael Victor,
Michael Thomas.
All right.
Sample intro,
make your own.

365
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.840
Now I'm reading yours.

366
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.770
Thanks to movement watches for their sponsorship of this podcast.

367
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.850
They sent over some watches and boy,
oh boy,
I haven't got them yet.

368
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.990
I haven't got him yet.
I'm sure they're nice.
Who doesn't like a watch check?

369
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:28.570
'Em Out is what it was with.

370
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.820
It was this little crowdfunded brand that is revolutionizing the watch game.

371
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.600
Uh,
they are starting to get a lot of press from Gq.

372
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:42.601
Playboy hypebeast askmen said they are the hottest watch company on the market.

373
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.430
They're all about the idea that high quality doesn't have to break the bank and

374
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:52.540
they actually deliver probably why they have over 1 million social media

375
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:55.000
followers.
Fucking bastards.

376
00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.100
They got 10 times when I got quality crafted watches starting at just $95 if you

377
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:03.220
tried to get a watch like this at the department store,

378
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:06.550
you'd be spending at least 400 to $500.

379
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.560
This style is minimalistic,
clean,
and sleek.
In other words,
it's got clayish.

380
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.930
You can weigh this thing at the office during the day or out at the bars at

381
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:20.050
night.
It's new,
it's shap.

382
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.650
And it's an all day where please spell MVMT when you're saying the URL and the

383
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:29.470
call to action.
All right,

You know,

391
00:23:57.921 --> 00:23:59.510

You know what?
You get your loved one.

393
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:09.260
A couple of tickets to the fourth annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.

394
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.350
January 26th,

395
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:16.610
that's a Tuesday at seven o'clock at the city center in New York City.

396
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.750
Um,
this has become an annual event.
It's one of my favorite things to do.

397
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:24.170
It's attribute of one of my great friends I ever had in life and the funniest

398
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.070
goddamn comedian I ever saw live Patrice O'Neil.

399
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.700
I'm still can't believe it.
It's been a

400
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.980
Jesus.
What did he died November 29th,
2011.

401
00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.950
What was it,
the 28th sometime right around here was four years ago.
So,
um,

402
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.700
we do the benefit to keep his name out there and we also do the benefit to a

403
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.870
financial,
we help out the people that he was taken care of when he was living.

404
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.210
And um,

405
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.830
it's the greatest thing ever because I'm so proud of that benefit because I feel

406
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:01.400
like all of his friends stepped up and um,

407
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:02.780
<v 5>okay.</v>

408
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.450
<v 3>I think if he was around and see what we were doing for them,</v>

409
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:08.240
I think it would be the one time he would actually not trash us at least for

410
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:10.770
like 30 seconds before he did.
Um,

411
00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.290
so it makes a great stocking stuffer and it's in,

412
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:18.080
it's a,
you're helping out,
uh,

413
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:21.400
the friends and family of the greatest comic that I ever saw.
All right.

414
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.100
This January 26th,
that's a Tuesday at the city center.

415
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.240
I will be posting the link.
We are already halfway sold out.

416
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:32.660
These tickets always go quickly.
Um,

417
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.570
couple of clicks and you could take care of somebody for Christmas and that's

418
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:38.540
one less thing you got to worry about and you don't have to get tackled in a

419
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:41.540
fucking department store.
Look at these God damn people,

420
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.240
Jesus Christ,

421
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:48.890
just grabbing at some big fucking TV bursting through.

422
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.040
I don't know legally how they're allowed to do this.

423
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.400
Like every year somebody gets fucking hurt.
It's like,

424
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:57.650
how is this not inciting a riot?

425
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.390
Black Friday on sale from a to Friday,
November 28th,

426
00:26:04.391 --> 00:26:06.070
some sort of fucking TV.

427
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.110
Everybody with their big winter coats.

428
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:15.770
Look at this guy fucking three adults just completely losing their fucking

429
00:26:15.961 --> 00:26:20.460
composure.
Then I love the TV cameras.
This sitting there laughing,

430
00:26:20.461 --> 00:26:22.230
watching all these fucking people,

431
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.890
it seems a little less violence.

432
00:26:25.891 --> 00:26:30.891
You guys see the video clip of the woman just she's clinging to a flat screen.

433
00:26:30.961 --> 00:26:34.270
TV is somebody else drags it down the aisle.
She's got like,

434
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.690
<v 6>the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?</v>

435
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.210
<v 3>Oh,
they hoard it up here at cheerleaders.</v>

436
00:26:40.211 --> 00:26:44.830
Keep crowds going at the Wembley store in north.
Oh my God,
this is England.

437
00:26:44.831 --> 00:26:48.940
I love it.
They bought into it too.
Oh,

438
00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:52.060
that's tremendous.
That's fucking tremendous.

439
00:26:52.061 --> 00:26:54.250
Just when you think we can't get any dumber,

440
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.640
all fucking London comes into fucking save rs little tykes playhouse.

441
00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:04.270
Bullies do.
You went there and got some first kid.
I don't know.

442
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:10.060
I don't fucking get it anyways.
It's not worth it.

443
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.270
Do you know the other day I was looking,
I was looking at cars,
right?

444
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.270
My wife needs a new car and a,

445
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.180
<v 5>okay.</v>

446
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.760
<v 3>I went in and I looked at the car and as I was getting out of the car,</v>

447
00:27:20.761 --> 00:27:24.980
another buyer comes along.
He goes,
what'd you think of it?
It's a queen mean.

448
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.180
What the fuck did I think of it?
None of your fucking business.
What?

449
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:29.810
I thought of it.
The salesman's right here.
If I think of something about it,

450
00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:31.800
I've got to negotiate.
I'm not gonna tell you that.
I like it.

451
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.830
And then he gets in the car to go fucking test drive it.

452
00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.030
So the,
so then the,
the,
the fucking salesman is go,
oh,
you know,

453
00:27:40.031 --> 00:27:42.130
so what are we doing here?
It's like,
I dunno,
what are we doing here?

454
00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:46.450
I just took that thing for ride that cut just drove away in it.
So now what?

455
00:27:46.451 --> 00:27:50.050
Now what?
I'm going to fucking bid on the car against this fucking guy.

456
00:27:50.051 --> 00:27:54.820
Sell it to him.
So if I thread my said dad,
go fuck yourself.

457
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:55.720
And that was the end of the day.

458
00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.850
I don't do that shit.
Start competing with this guy.
I,

459
00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:08.440
I honestly,
I just don't give a shit.
I don't give a fuck.
Right?
Am I nuts?

460
00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:12.610
Like that?
My crazy is that,
is that insensitive?

461
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.920
At some point I'll figure it out.
I never know how to do that shit.
Anyways.

462
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.540
Um,
so anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
I'm sitting here battling.
All right.

463
00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:27.541
The fucking patriots beat the Goddamn buffalo bill swept our asses for the year,

464
00:28:28.691 --> 00:28:31.630
which I love,
cause I wish any fucking ill will on them.

465
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.890
They're fucking fans would talk so much.
God Damn Shit to me.
All right,

466
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.230
fucking rex.
Ryan's always talking shit.

467
00:28:38.231 --> 00:28:40.150
It's always nice that they got the old right there,

468
00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:44.040
Fred fucking twice this year so they can shut their fucking wing.

469
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:47.830
Eaton faces for another God damn year.
All right.
Having said that,

470
00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.330
I still think rex is a great coach.

471
00:28:49.331 --> 00:28:51.580
He just needs a quarterback and they got a hell of a defense.

472
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.620
They got a hell of a difference.
But it was fun watching them all,
all the bills,

473
00:28:56.621 --> 00:28:57.790
fans tweeting at me,

474
00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.240
giving me all this fucking shit in the first half and then they just slowly go

475
00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:05.260
away.
This is,
I got overreading hiccups in the morning.
How pathetic is this?

476
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.160
This is like Le Leftover from yesterday.
Um,

477
00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:14.700
and my fucking Boston Bruins,
they're a,

478
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:17.440
they got a nice all three game winning streak they got arranges today,

479
00:29:17.441 --> 00:29:21.610
which is obviously will be a tough game,
but I'm psyched that uh,
you know,

480
00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:24.460
hopefully this starting to turn it around here.
I Dunno.

481
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.370
We'll see what they do with the trade deadline.
Maybe they'll get,

482
00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:30.400
they'll pick up somebody.
Um,
well who knows.

483
00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:34.870
Maybe a draft pick will turn into something.
I don't know.
I have no idea.

484
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.110
So a,
I think I'm going to go to the auto show today.

485
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.050
I'm going to go down there and see what the fuck's going on.
Cause I don't like,

486
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.040
don't like fucking,
I don't like salesman car salesman.
You barely get on the lot.

487
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.331
The same thing.

488
00:29:47.331 --> 00:29:50.030
Like when you walk into a fucking store second you walk into soil,
hey,

489
00:29:50.031 --> 00:29:54.830
how are you?
What can I do your for?
You know,
I like those ones.

490
00:29:54.831 --> 00:29:57.710
You walk in and they go,
hey,
how are you?
Let me know if you need anything.

491
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.500
Then I'm like,
all right,
I can relax now and I'm probably going to buy something.

492
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.390
And it's like you're all looking forward and particular yeah,

493
00:30:05.391 --> 00:30:08.300
I'm looking for you to fuck off.
Well I,
I,
I'm,
I'm an adult.

494
00:30:08.301 --> 00:30:09.770
If I see something that I like,

495
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.180
I will take it off and I will try it on and I will make my decision.

496
00:30:14.181 --> 00:30:18.290
I don't need you to fucking sort of a grease the pipes here.
All right,

497
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.510
so why don't you and your little fucking a

498

Why don't you go ahead you guys,</v>

502
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:31.410
when she was fuck off,
why don't I ever have the nerve to say that,

503
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.890
<v 0>you know,</v>

504
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.880
<v 3>I just don't have to fucking polite.
Can I help you?</v>

505
00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.020
Yeah.
You know,
you get to help me.

506
00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:42.570
You could just leave me alone until I find what I want.

507
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.580
Like how do you say that nicely?
Yeah.

508
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.540
Some woman said something to me the other day in a fucking store and I wanted to

509
00:30:51.541 --> 00:30:53.550
say something back to her,
but I was just like,

510
00:30:53.551 --> 00:30:56.580
they would just be too fucking rude and I didn't say it.
Why don't,

511
00:30:56.581 --> 00:31:01.290
why don't I say it?
Wait,
I got say I'm smart enough to fail.

512
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.260
I'm not like everybody says,

513
00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.410
I just gotta be a way for me to figure out how to say that nicely.

514
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.893
<v 0>Can I help you?</v>

515
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.260

<v 3>Could you,

518
00:31:15.811 --> 00:31:19.500
I like being left alone and then I'll find what I want and then I go up and buy

519
00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:21.240
it.
Is that cool?

520
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.870
<v 5>Okay.</v>

521
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.770
<v 3>You fucking God.</v>

522
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.663
<v 0>Okay.</v>

523

527
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.350
<v 3>If I need help,
I'll ask you sir.
Please.
Was that polite?</v>

528
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.880
Oh,

Right.
Can I help you now?
Now you can't help me.

529
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.400
<v 5>Okay.</v>

530
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.230
<v 3>Yeah,
he can help me.
Can you fucking take a,</v>

531
00:31:58.231 --> 00:32:01.290
a price tag off as something a lot cheaper and put on the thing I want.

532
00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:03.810
Can you do that?
Well,
yeah.
You can't help it.

533
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.040
Oh,
I'll yell if I want to.

534
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.220
It's my fog can time and I'll yell if I want to.
Um,

535
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.610
all right.
That's it.
That's the fucking post thanksgiving.

536
00:32:17.611 --> 00:32:22.230
A Thursday afternoon podcast.
I know.
I was a bit all over the place.

537
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.860
Um,
oh,

538
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.680
I didn't even talk about any of the fucking games I watched yesterday.

539
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.640
<v 5>Okay.</v>

540
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.330
<v 3>Who was the first game?
The lions beat the shit out of the fucking eagles.
Good.</v>

541
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:38.270
Good Lord.
I'm not really to talk about there.

542
00:32:38.271 --> 00:32:42.500
It was just a one sided affair.
You know what's funny?
Versie picked Sanchez.

543
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:43.850
He always believed that Sanchez,

544
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:48.170
like he bought into that Sanchez Shit and I bought into a,
what's his face?

545
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:50.990
The other guy there when he played on Saint Lewis,
the guy from Oklahoma,

546
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:53.990
and I can't remember his fucking name.
He looks like Kiana reads.
If he was smart.

547
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.360
What is his fucking name?
Uh,
uh,
Jesus Christ.

548
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

549
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:01.860
<v 3>The Fox,
the guy's name.</v>

550
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.953
<v 0>I Dunno</v>

551
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.160
<v 3>who the fuck knows.
And they both ended up on the same goddamn team.</v>

552
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.543
<v 0>MMM.</v>

553
00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.240
<v 3>I gotta tell you though,
Sanchez isn't as bad as everybody says</v>

554
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:15.883
<v 0>he hasn't,</v>

555
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:20.360
<v 3>but he also,
he's not a franchise player.
Oh,
really?
Bill,
did you,</v>

556
00:33:20.361 --> 00:33:24.200
did you figure that out?
What?
10 years into his fucking career.
Alright,

557
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.540
plowing ahead then the next game.

558
00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:27.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

559
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:32.590
<v 3>Was what that was the cowboys versus the path is how great does the Panthers</v>

560
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.660
Defense Look?
Jesus Christ and I felt bad for Tony Romo.
Good Lord.

561
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.530
Good Lord.
Thrown right back into the fucking fights.
I still liked that guy.

562
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:45.630
I know a lot of people don't,
but I gotta tell you,
man,
throwing to pick six.

563
00:33:45.631 --> 00:33:49.570
It's in the same fucking quarter.
I can't remember the last time I saw that.

564
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.830
I think you've got to go back to like Neil O'Donnell.
Uh,
then he gets slammed.

565
00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:56.860
They fucking breaks his God damn collar bone again.

566
00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.200
What a brutal fucking season for the cowboys.

567
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.530
I was rooting really hard for those guys.
Uh,

568
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:06.820
I was kind of hoping that I was going to see Romo come back and he'd win the

569
00:34:06.821 --> 00:34:11.280
remaining like five games of the year or whatever or all the rest of the old

570
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.120
they,
they were two and seven,
right?
Yeah.

571
00:34:13.121 --> 00:34:17.060
So when the remaining seven games of the year,
they go nine,

572
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.780
nine and seven make the fucking playoffs.

573
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.870
I'll tell you what fucking kills me because you guys know I never want to see

574
00:34:22.871 --> 00:34:26.770
Eli again in the playoffs.
A lie fades back to pass.

575
00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.493
<v 0>Okay.</v>

576
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.130
<v 3>Loses both of his shows it as hell.
Hey,
fumbles the ball.</v>

577
00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:37.850
It goes to the aids out of the other recalls,
you recovered,
it squirts out.

578
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.340
Let's back at Eli's any frozen.

579
00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.650
I never said I don't ever want to play that guy again.

580
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:54.590
Ever play him again.
What's killing me is the giants' record.

581
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:57.320
They should be in the last or second to last place.

582
00:34:57.321 --> 00:34:59.810
They were in like first place at like five and five aren't they?

583
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:05.720
Like I think seven and nine could win that division in the history of football.

584
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.620
Get has as a losing record ever won a division.
That's my question for you guys.

585
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.760
I remember years ago,
uh,
the San Diego chargers,

586
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:14.960
like two years in a row,

587
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:19.100
they were eight and eight and nine and seven and they won the AFC west and then

588
00:35:19.101 --> 00:35:22.820
went into Indianapolis and beat the colts at home,
by the way.

589
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.440
All right,

590
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.440
for you creationists who still believe in fucking Peyton manning over Tom Brady.

591
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.220
<v 0>Huh?
I'm fucking with you.</v>

592
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.120
<v 3>Yeah,
they're five and five.
And they're,</v>

593
00:35:36.121 --> 00:35:40.390
they're like in first place or tied for first place because everybody in that

594
00:35:40.391 --> 00:35:42.640
division is having such a shit fucking year.

595
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.820
And the thing about the giants is they have enough weapons.

596
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:49.270
They got the coach and they got the quarterback that even though they'll be

597
00:35:49.271 --> 00:35:53.530
fucking seven and nine or eight,
eight and when that division,
you know,

598
00:35:53.531 --> 00:35:56.470
everybody's zero and zero and they get to the playoffs.
And I just,

599
00:35:56.471 --> 00:36:01.010
I just got this weird fucking feeling,
but I gotta tell you this.

600
00:36:01.011 --> 00:36:03.970
So if they have to go down to a no,
I even think they could do that.

601
00:36:03.971 --> 00:36:05.230
I think they could go into Carolina.

602
00:36:05.231 --> 00:36:08.310
I think they could beat the panthers because a,

603
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:12.030
they know how to fucking win and the panthers are still really young.

604
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:13.743
<v 0>You know,</v>

605
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.170
<v 3>you can tell they're young.</v>

606
00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.110
Every time they make a play there talking shit that jumping around,

607
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:22.050
they're ripping that fucking jerseys open like this superman.
That's,

608
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:23.910
that's all young people.
Shit.
Yeah.

609
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.993
<v 0>You know.</v>

610
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.040
<v 7>Oh,
this is what we do.</v>

611
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.370
<v 3>City.
Just walking back to the fucking huddle.
Um,
oh God.
I'm such an old concept.</v>

612
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.130
Anyways,
I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your weekend.

613
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:39.510
I'm really excited about tomorrow.

614
00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:43.800
That's obviously the big rivalry days in a fury he ever wanted to get into

615
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:47.910
college football.
The Saturday after thanksgiving.
You got to do it.
You got USC,

616
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.650
Ucla.
You got the a fucking Alabama Auburn.

617
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.970
You get Michigan,
Ohio state.
Why don't you start Michigan,
Ohio state do Auburn,

618
00:36:56.971 --> 00:36:59.220
Alabama and Ucla.
USC.

619
00:36:59.221 --> 00:37:01.530
Even though I don't know how good a good a game that's going to be this year.

620
00:37:01.531 --> 00:37:04.740
But um,
oh man,

621
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:09.741
it fucking Jim Harbaugh leads fucking Michigan in at fucking beats the buckeyes.

622
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:17.070
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.
Your baby whale,
man.
Dude,

623
00:37:17.071 --> 00:37:20.400
people will fucking,
they will lose it.
God,
their minds,

624
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.710
they will lose their fucking minds.
What a fucking job he did.

625
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.360
Like how much of a cunt could to that guy have been that the 40 niners got rid

626
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:31.194
of him.

627
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

628
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.810
<v 3>I just don't,
I don't get it.
That guy is fucking is unbelievable.</v>

629
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:37.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

630
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.300
<v 3>He restored the 40 niners they went to a fucking,</v>

631
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.790
they went to a fucking super bowl.
They didn't win it,
but she's,

632
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.370
I just don't fucking understand it.
I just,
for the life of me,

633
00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:51.930
I don't understand why they got rid of that guy.
Um,

634
00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:56.050
I also understand that he is out of his fucking mind,
but he went,

635
00:37:56.051 --> 00:38:00.820
so who gives a shit?
Right?
My nuts.
I don't know.
That's it.

636
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.010
All right.
Whatever.
I'm all over the,

637
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.580
I'm still full of food and Shit and all that type of stuff.
Um,
all right,

638
00:38:06.581 --> 00:38:07.331
that's the podcast.

639
00:38:07.331 --> 00:38:11.350
I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the weekend and now please enjoy,
uh,
the,

640
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.430
the throwback,
the last half hour where we take some greatest hits,

641
00:38:15.431 --> 00:38:20.290
some clips from a yesteryear and a Monday,
a long time ago.

642
00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:21.943
All right.

643
00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:26.470
Back when Apes Walk the Earth Upright and you felt like you could talk to them,

644
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:30.880
but you couldn't.
You know what I mean?
Lucy,
Lucy over here.

645
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.930
What's going on?
God Damn it.
You stink.
All right,

646
00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:36.943
<v 1>I'll see you</v>

647
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.640
sexting.
Sexting.
All right.
This isn't really,
well this is about this guy.
He,

648
00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:25.560
I remember I told you that story,
um,
about that dude.
Uh,

649
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:29.000
he worked for some corporations,
see a cubicles.
All right?

650
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.860
And then I'm sure he's on some sort of team.

651
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.710
Everybody has to do some sort of song before they go in there.

652
00:39:34.711 --> 00:39:38.090
Like those poor kids in the building exercises.
Yeah.

653
00:39:38.091 --> 00:39:40.560
Like just people who work at the cold stone creamery.

654
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:45.320
You ever see them like with like making like the Goddamn,
uh,
ice cream going,

655
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:49.260
hi Ho.
Hi Ho.
It's off to work.

656
00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:54.261
I like the part of me dies when I see that when I just see people like,

657
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:55.030
uh,

658
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:59.490
it's like basically watching someone work in like an ice cream death camp when

659
00:39:59.491 --> 00:40:03.540
I'm in there,
none of them are happy.

660
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.070
None of them dreamed of doing that ice cream.
Death can.

661
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.410
Maybe if you're like a fatty,

662
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:12.330
you don't know when you got a job in an ice cream store,

663
00:40:12.331 --> 00:40:16.160
kind of like a pedophile getting a job at like a a cub scout camp.
Wow.

664
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:22.260
Isn't that where they always end up?
I love working with kids.
You know,

665
00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:26.550
I said that last week.
Follow your dreams unless you're a pedophile.
Right?

666
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.490
So answer then using that,
I shouldn't say that.

667
00:40:29.491 --> 00:40:33.300
I have a problem with a fatties working in the ice cream store.
Let,
let's,
let's,

668
00:40:33.301 --> 00:40:37.140
let's get to this shit.
So anyways,
so they're going to get everybody in shape.

669
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.290
So they hire some sort of personal trainer and he's trained in everybody.

670
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:44.190
All right.
And what he does is he gets everybody's emails.
Great move on.

671
00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:46.170
This guy's part fucking great move.

672
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.060
Now he doesn't have to deal with them face to face.

673
00:40:48.061 --> 00:40:50.130
And if there's any fucking hotties he wants to bang,

674
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.820
he can take it to the next level.
Perfect.
That's how you do it.

675
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.540
It's like shooting fish in a fucking barrel or efficient barrel than of in a

676
00:40:57.541 --> 00:41:02.400
shooting gallery.
Um,
so anyways,

677
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.650
so that all of a sudden this guy notices that,
you know,
he gets one text going,

678
00:41:07.651 --> 00:41:08.730
Hey Brad,
you know,

679
00:41:08.731 --> 00:41:11.610
just do a couple more rod jumping jacks and you should be fine.

680
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.330
But for some reason his little hottie wife has to get like 40 fucking texts from

681
00:41:15.331 --> 00:41:19.140
this guy at like 1130 at night.
Oh,
I do remember this.
Yeah.

682
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.080
He and his wife work at the same place.
Yeah.
That's interesting.

683
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:26.220
At the same place.
Right.
So he fucking a,
he finds out about,

684
00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.650
he keeps asking his wife,
I remember this.
Okay.
All right,

685
00:41:28.651 --> 00:41:30.860
well I'm going to recap for people to listen last week.
Right.

686
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.450
So he keeps asking is what keeps catching wife late at night texting going and

687
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:36.770
he goes,
who are you texting?

688
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.950
And she would immediately slammed the phone shut cause he's got a flip phone

689
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.160
evidently and would say,
uh,

690
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.840
no button either would say nobody or get mad and say nobody.
Right?

691
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.480
So this is not a moron.
He figured out something's up.
He's in the,

692
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:53.900
he's into some sort of fucking spygate shit where he's at.

693
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:54.950
He hacks into her thing,

694
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:58.850
gets her password and sees that all these text messages back and forth to

695
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:01.640
trainers.
So what is he doing?
He's a God damn man.

696
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.900
Does he slap his fucking wife around?
No.
He goes right to the trainer and says,

697
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:09.740
Hey,
it says hey sport.
No cause you get sued.
You get sued for that.

698
00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:14.480
Now you get sued for kicking somebody's ass when you're right,
you go.
He goes,

699
00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:15.080
hey sport,

700
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.650
once you do me a favor and stop texting my fucking wife and all hours of the

701
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.910
night.
So then a sport,

702
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:22.070
oh they're immediately starts acting like a bitch around them.

703
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:26.210
Starts acting overly nice.
Like you know what all guilty people do.
He's innocent.

704
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.940
He would've gotten mad.
Sure be like,
dude,
what the fuck are you talking about?

705
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.220
I always text people about how to get,

706
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:34.760
make their core stronger at two in the morning,
I'm dedicated.

707
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.540
Maybe should be inspired by what I'm doing.
I specifically,

708
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:43.040
I am interested in women having a strong core because they're so beaten down in

709
00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:45.550
society.
You know,
he would have come back with some shit like that,
but he didn't.

710
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.540
Now he's all like,
hey man,
who are you with?

711
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:50.570
This whole police don't beat the shit out of me and exposed me for being the

712
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:54.830
dirt bag.
I am.
So I lose this giant moneymaking client here.
Right?
So anyways,

713
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.680
she denies the whole fucking thing.
So he sent a couple of,
uh,

714
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.520
actually a couple of texts that this girl wrote.
Uh,

715
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.320
they were talking about the Beatles and uh,

716
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.370
he writes all those Damn Beatles songs,

717
00:43:10.371 --> 00:43:14.750
make my stomach hurt when I listened to them because it reminds me of getting

718
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:17.900
ready to go see you.
They give me anxiety.

719
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:20.870
This is what the trainer is writing to this guy's wife,

720
00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:24.650
not what sort of a exercise are they talking about?
There?
Is that,
uh,

721
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:26.540
what does that,
is that pushups?

722
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.680
So then she writes back all the lonely people,
where do they all belong?

723
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.580
Oh God.
Right.
And then he said,

724
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:40.550
I remember you asking me if I related to that song,

725
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.660
if I relate to that song to you,
because I thought you were lonely.

726
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:49.340
It's talking about our fucking marriage.
Oh,
this guy,

727
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.690
this guy is a dirt bag.
It's like,
I love it.
I love it.
It's the classic,

728
00:43:53.691 --> 00:43:57.800
he listens to me.
Yeah.
Oh,
this guy,
he's just saying everything.

729
00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:01.790
We talk about music.
Yeah.
My feelings.
Oh yeah.

730
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.700
My husband doesn't do that.
And what it is,
is his dick is,
is,

731
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.390
is downloading all the knowledge in this guy's brain that he has about human

732
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:14.360
beings.
And he's just given her in the Dick is just,
is,
is,

733
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.310
is basically sitting in the captain Kirk Chair.

734
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:19.940
He's just fucking anything she wants to hear.
So anyways,
um,

735
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.300
then he write another one.
He said,
I know,
fuck my life.

736
00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:27.680
I wear my fuck my life to sleep and I have a confession to make.

737
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:32.500
I also wear your panties.
She goes,
lol,

738
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:34.810
shut up.
He writes.
It's true.

739
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:36.650
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

740
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:40.070
<v 1>So I dunno what kind of fucking shit this guy's into,</v>

741
00:44:40.071 --> 00:44:45.071
but the real question is not whether or not that that's socially acceptable.

742
00:44:45.531 --> 00:44:49.220
The real question is how did he get this married woman's panties?

743
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.780
He at least finger blasted off.

744
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.580
<v 9>Would you go with me on that?
I mean,</v>

745
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.450
if mean maybe he's just saying that to be just like controversial.

746
00:44:57.451 --> 00:45:01.500
That's what I thought.
But she goes,
lol,
shut up.
He goes,

747
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:02.490
it's true.

748
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:03.470
<v 5>Okay.</v>

749
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.770
<v 9>Yeah,
but he does still,
maybe Joe,
you talk into the mic.
Oh,
he made it.</v>

750
00:45:06.771 --> 00:45:09.980
Still be joking around.
But if you're just wearing,
but if he is,

751
00:45:09.981 --> 00:45:11.960
she gave it to him.
How else would he have him?

752
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:15.590
And they're talking about the Beatles and shit.
She gave it to him if it's true.

753
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.400
<v 1>Okay.
So that's based what I'm saying.
It's so fucking,
he's got a fucking panties.</v>

754
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:26.580
They're both adults.
I'm guessing by this.
She's like in her thirties.

755
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.780
What is he doing fingering her and taken her out for a malt.
He's banging her.

756
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:35.060
<v 9>He fucking Bangor.
This fucking piece of shit.</v>

757
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:37.180
Who'd be a great movie.

758
00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:40.780
<v 1>She a great character for a fucking movie.
Um,
so anyways,
he,</v>

759
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:42.040
and this is what he said,
his wife,

760
00:45:42.041 --> 00:45:45.190
she's still Dennis denying this whole conversation ever happened.

761
00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.270
She's just incomplete,
obviously denial.
She's in denial.
He said,
I'm dumping her,

762
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:54.520
uh,
not for the reminiscing talk,
but fun,
but for lying to me.

763
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.960
Uh,
he's not interested in trying to,
uh,

764
00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.620
please say that Nia and I swear to

765
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.570
<v 9>got it.
And the throwing my computer,
I will throw this fucking computer at you.</v>

766
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.870
Are you fucking,
he's not interested in what?
I don't know.

767
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.640
Working it out.
Don't throw it.
No,
no,
no.
Go ahead.

768
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.760
I'm just going to leave you with dead silence.
Gonna tell me.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no.

769
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:18.990
I just,
I don't know.
No,

770
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:23.400
he's well within his right eye was just posing a question that's all well within

771
00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:24.234
his right.

772
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:28.680
I don't understand why she doesn't just fess up then.

773
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:34.260
That's a whole nother topic.
The topic.
I mean what would I know?

774
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:38.880
Like some things I walking away is missing now.

775
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:40.770
I feel like part of the story is missing or something.

776
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:45.180
What the video of them fucking is that what's missing?
What else is missing?

777
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.220
Yeah.
If he's like,
hey mia,

778
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:50.580
if you start blaming him for not paying attention and that's why she's fucking

779
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:53.620
this guy,
I will,
I will fucking throw you out of this room.
Morrow,

780
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.820
I'm not to calm down.
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm just saying.

781
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.320
So he says to her,
are you cheating on or you'd fucking this guy?
And she's like,

782
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:04.270
no,
shut up.
What are you talking about?
Like,
and she just flat out deny.

783
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:08.460
I don't understand how she can flat out deny something as hard as shit.

784
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.480
That's why I'm so,
she's a lying piece of shit on Nia.
Yeah.

785
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:14.910
But if you have something and you're like looking at it like this is what you

786
00:47:14.911 --> 00:47:16.470
wrote,
how are you denying it?

787
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:18.330
<v 5>Okay.</v>

788
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:22.230
<v 1>Cause she just,
she's,
that's what denial is.
You're totally in denial.</v>

789
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.680
I don't have a drinking problem cause you fucking drinking nyquil.

790
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:31.310
I think it tastes good.
I don't have a problem.
Right?
Yeah.
I like sweeping,

791
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:38.110
you know?
Uh,
yeah.
You know what it is.

792
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.760
I'm just making sure you keep speaking into the mic.

793
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:40.690
This is what you kicked her out of it.

794
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.210
I want people to hear what you have to say.
Ah,
okay.
All right.
I ride what?

795
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:48.790
This is good shit and I'm ruining it.

796
00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:55.780
Fucking Lord.
You know what kills me as she was still like,
it's just,
I dunno.

797
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:57.730
I'm going to on a piss you off right now.

798
00:47:57.731 --> 00:48:01.690
You ladies will defend you guys defend each other like right there.
And if they,

799
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.440
if a guy did that,
I am not defending her.
Let me,
can I get out my one?

800
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.740
I'm going to say,
if a guy did that shit,
you'd be like,
dump his ass girl.

801
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:11.080
He's a fucking loser.
You can do better than that.

802
00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:14.980
Call me will lead a little moon pie.
I'll build you up.

803
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.500
That's what the fuck you would have done.
But because yeah,

804
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:21.580
I just feel like some part of the story is mythic.
What is missing?

805
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:27.370
I guess nothing.
Thank you Nia.
Thank you for being on the podcast.

806
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:28.661
Is that what you want?

807
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:32.930
And you just want me to come with a good fucking 20 minutes?
Yeah.

808
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.310
Not agree with me.
Agree with the decision this guy made.
This isn't about mania.

809
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.990
Please.
Okay.
I'm just a messenger here.
You know,
I'm just trying to do,

810
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:42.420
I'm just trying to do what's right.
All right.

811
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.950
Because it's very clear what's happening and then you've got someone who's this

812
00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:47.560
lag.
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right,
here's the deal,

813
00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.200
man or woman.
Um,

814
00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:53.650
if the person you're with is texting past,

815
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.560
I would even for regular people who aren't in show business,

816
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:01.120
the Buddhi hour starts after 11.
I would say after 11.
Yeah,

817
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:05.800
but that's,
but that's what somebody,
you're already fucking okay.

818
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.750
I know you don't understand it because you don't have to talk yourself into it

819
00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:12.610
guys.
We have to,
we have to spin the plates second.

820
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:17.190
We meet her all the way through.
So you got to be setting it up.
Okay.
I'm always,

821
00:49:17.191 --> 00:49:21.230
you know,
seven 30 is too creepy and stalkerish.
Um,

822
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:25.630
and I would say a,
you start going past nine 30,
she's going to feel like,

823
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:28.450
like you just see some sort of tramp if you haven't fucked her yet.
Right.

824
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:30.510
So you got to you that does that,
does that window,
Huh?

825
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.820
About eight 15 to about 970 you have to do the setup text.

826
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.450
Okay.
And the setup text is not talking about pussy.

827
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.800
It's go,
Oh,
you know,
I'm,

828
00:49:42.801 --> 00:49:46.900
I'm watching Blahblahblah on TV a so and so is so ridiculous.

829
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:50.380
I'm sort of fucking just to get it going.
You know what I mean?
Right.

830
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.750
Does that seem like Ryan Benign?
Yeah,
like a boxer.

831
00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.930
You feel him out in the first round or the Beatles?
Yeah.
You don't load it up,

832
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:58.780
right?
You're feeling it up.
Yeah.
That's what they're doing.
Right.

833
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:02.110
This fucking guy this fucking day,
this guy,

834
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:05.350
you know something as much as a piece of shit is that,
that guy is,

835
00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.120
if he writes a book,
I would read it in a second.
And why?
Because you know,

836
00:50:10.121 --> 00:50:10.601
he's got great,

837
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:15.601
I mean the position he has that's like when I used to take,

838
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:16.750
I used to take that,
uh,

839
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:20.500
that yoga class when I was out here and there was that guy out in Santa Monica

840
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:25.501
and he was a phenomenal fucking teacher and this place was jam packed and it was

841
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:29.170
by donation only.
So then for tax purposes,

842
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.940
I think he falls under a church.

843
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.290
I know it helped them with taxes and it's all in cash,
so it's all good.

844
00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.840
All right.
And then to hottest fucking women.

845
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.490
Some of the hottest women ever move out to La to become actresses.
Okay.

846
00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:43.590
He's got them in his class,
getting up,

847
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:47.260
getting them all stretched out before he bags him.
It was one of the greatest.

848
00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.070
It was,
it was fucking airtight.
Yeah.

849
00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:54.220
And he would go around the class and somehow me having never touched my toes

850
00:50:54.221 --> 00:50:58.510
since I was in the womb with somehow always doing every position correctly.

851
00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:02.530
Yet all these other hotties always needed to be adjusted right around this.

852
00:51:02.531 --> 00:51:04.250
So as,
um,

853
00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.800
so I don't get mad at a guy who's got a good thing,
but you,
you know,

854
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.430
stay away from the fucking married ladies.
Yes.

855
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:07.603
<v 8>Okay.</v>

856
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:09.680
<v 9>Oh,
I know what I wanted to talk about.</v>

857
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:13.670
How about a moment of silence for another two,

858
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.930
for the next two great men who have,

859
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:22.840
who are about ready to be sliced in half by their fucking ex wives.

860
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:28.550
How about a moment of silent for Koby Bryant,
that fucking warrior.

861
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.433
Okay.

862
00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.540
Who had an injury to his fucking right hand that would have kept most people out

863
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:38.300
for half a season.
He didn't even miss a fucking game.

864
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:44.750
Showed up hitting all kinds of big shots at absolute fucking warrior.

865
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.920
He is about ready to have to fork over $190 million to his fucking ex wife.

866
00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:55.730
And I'm a to,
other than that,

867
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:58.430
I want to talk to all the fuck of women right now who are going,
that's right.

868
00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:02.810
That's right.
You know,
this is what I want from you guys this week.

869
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.513
All right.

870
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:09.730
I want you to justify the fucking divorce laws in this country.

871
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.800
I want you to justify them.

872
00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:17.210
I want you to tell me why she deserves $190 million.

873
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.840
I want you to justify it.
Don't just go,
wow,
that that's because that's the law.

874
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:29.540
Oh,
there you go.
I don't want that.
I want you to justify it.

875
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:34.640
Like if I asked you why is murder illegal,

876
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.120
you wouldn't be like,
wow,

877
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:40.220
that's the law that's about it says that you do.

878
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.481
You'd be like,

879
00:53:41.481 --> 00:53:46.010
because life is the most precious thing on this planet and everything has the

880
00:53:46.011 --> 00:53:47.570
right to be alive and you.

881
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:52.580
You need to respect that you only get one life and for someone to take your life

882
00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:55.610
is the worst thing you could eat.
That's how you would defend that law.

883
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.660
I have fucking racked my brain,

884
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.533
<v 2>okay?</v>

885
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:05.580
<v 9>To try and justify how anybody</v>

886
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:11.850
is entitled to $190 million of somebody else's fucking money.

887
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.680
Remember that story I told you last week?
Sure.
We all do.

888
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:21.810
I'm going to bring it up.
This fucking guy got accused of rape,
gets convicted,

889
00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:25.740
goes to jail.
25 years in fucking prison.

890
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:32.180
They find out afterwards through dead the new DNA technology that he didn't

891
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:36.480
fucking do it without a doubt.
We had the wrong guy.

892
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.220
You know what he got for 25 years of trying to make sure somebody didn't stick

893
00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:45.120
there dangling in his fucking door knob that he makes sense,
whatever.

894
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:50.160
He got $4 million,
4 million bucks.

895
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:56.210
This bitch has been living high on the fucking hog for 10 fucking years,

896
00:54:58.650 --> 00:54:59.480
<v 2>okay?</v>

897
00:54:59.480 --> 00:54:59.930
<v 9>You know,</v>

898
00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:04.250
can't even hit a fucking lay up on a God damn nerf hoop set and she's going to

899
00:55:04.251 --> 00:55:06.920
get 190 million fucking dollars.
Ladies,

900
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:11.150
I want you to justify QP fucking justify that to me.

901
00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.740
<v 1>That is the biggest crock of fucking shit ever.</v>

902
00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.480
You know what I,
you know what I love and then I'll got,
well he fucked around.

903
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:23.480
He fucked around.
Yeah,
he did fuck around.
So he should have to pay for it,

904
00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:27.290
but should be $190 million.
C'Mon.
That's fucking ridiculous.

905
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:32.480
Some guy gets falsely accused for rape,
spends 25 years in Rikers island.

906
00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:36.650
People slash in each other's faces,
thrown in,
boiling water on each other,

907
00:55:36.651 --> 00:55:39.260
people getting raped.
All this fucking shit.
You got to go through

908
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:44.480
and you only get $4 million.
His pitch is going to get $190 million.

909
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:49.100
I love how it's looked down upon to to cheat on your wife,

910
00:55:49.101 --> 00:55:53.240
but it's totally fine to tell somebody that you love them when you're really

911
00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:57.800
don't just because of all the shiny shit that they have.
You know,

912
00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:01.150
look at this.
Look at this woman.
He fucked around on it.

913
00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.430
She busted him for five fucking years ago.

914
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.090
The relationships over the trust is gone.

915
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.050
That relationship was fucking over.
Why did she stay?

916
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.410
Cause he bought her that big yellow fucking diamond.

917
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:19.363
Really?

918
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.730
<v 2>Okay.</v>

919
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:24.180
<v 1>That's why she stays and then what does she do?
She wanted outright,</v>

920
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.750
then she wanted out right then,
but that money was too fucking good.

921
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:33.370
And that bitch stuck around that big yellow diamonds showing it off very fucking

922
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:35.800
where she could.
Right.
And then what does she do?

923
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:40.950
She hangs around like some jaded cop trying to get her fucking pension.

924
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:46.090
She sticks around for 10 fucking years.
The second 10 years comes around.

925
00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:50.290
She gives us a for Christmas gift.
Hey Colby,
go fuck yourself by the way.

926
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:54.820
That'll cost you $190 million.
All right.

927
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:57.940
In my world,
this is how that would work if that,

928
00:56:57.941 --> 00:57:00.640
if she wanted the entire 190 million.

929
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:04.120
I'm really burning a lot of material here cause I'm going to fucking vent about

930
00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:05.920
this on stage.
So you're hearing this first.

931
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.260
This is like when you hear one of those Zeppelin songs before they fucking a

932
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:14.200
Polish it off.
All right,
this is too good.
Not to fucking say on stage.

933
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:19.230
I have to do this shit if I do say so myself or maybe I just love ranting about

934
00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:23.980
their shit.
This is,
this is how she should get this fucking money.
All right.
Hey.

935
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:27.510
Hey,
whatever your name is,
Bryant,
you know,

936
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.070
isn't it amazing how you never know what their fucking names or you know,

937
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:34.690
cause cause they don't win any fucking championships doing anything,
right?
Um,

938
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.100
this is how I think that she should get the hundred 90 million.
All right?

939
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:43.990
You start off,
no matter what misses,
whatever your name is,

940
00:57:43.991 --> 00:57:48.250
Bryant,
you're getting $30 million,
okay?

941
00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:53.410
Which has plenty of fucking money.
You raise a whole God damn family on that.

942
00:57:53.411 --> 00:57:57.400
Live in a nice fucking house and have a nice car and still have 20 million

943
00:57:57.401 --> 00:58:01.900
leftover.
All right?
So no matter what,
you're getting 30 million,

944
00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:05.710
you want to get up to 190 million and let's go down to the staples center,

945
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:10.240
sweetheart.
All right,
we're gonna start off easy.
You give him a basketball,

946
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:14.380
you fucking have the whole place jam packed with people screaming at her,

947
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:20.050
shaking the signs and blowing air horns,
right?
All right.

948
00:58:20.051 --> 00:58:22.990
If you hit a layup,
Mrs,
whatever your name is,
Bryant,

949
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.690
we're going to give you another 5 million,
right?

950
00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:28.600
She hits that you moved to the next round.
Then you go to the foul line.

951
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:30.370
You want to take another 20 million,

952
00:58:30.371 --> 00:58:32.950
you got to hit a foul shot and everybody's screaming.

953
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.050
Just have a bunch of fucking divorce guy sleeping on futons standing by the back

954
00:58:37.051 --> 00:58:41.410
port screaming at this bitch.
You hit that,
you move to the half court line,

955
00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:42.341
you hit it.

956
00:58:42.341 --> 00:58:46.210
You can only get one shot to just like Coby at the end of the fucking game.

957
00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.860
How he made all this money by hitting the big shots when there was fucking

958
00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:53.980
20,000 people screaming at him who didn't want him to do it.

959
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:59.110
You go to the fucking half court line.
You hit that.
What are we up to?

960
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:03.940
What are we up to?
That's 50 million,
55 million.
We'll give you 50 million,

961
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.680
50 million.
If he hit a half court,
then you go to the full court.

962
00:59:08.681 --> 00:59:13.600
You go full court.
If you hit that,
you get,
you can even do off the back board.

963
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:14.381
We don't give a shit.

964
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:18.760
You'll get the other 90 that's how you get your hundred 90 why don't you fucking

965
00:59:18.761 --> 00:59:22.180
earn it?
It's unreal.
Mel Gibson's wife,

966
00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:24.790
no gifts his wife.
You know,

967
00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:28.660
has she even shot a home movie she stands to get,

968
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:33.640
he's worth at one point was worth 800 million.
She's going to get $400 million.

969
00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:36.520
All right?
I want somebody,
some female,

970
00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:40.870
some human being out there with a vagina to send me an email.

971
00:59:40.871 --> 00:59:42.640
I want you to justify,

972
00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:48.910
justify $400 million.
Tell me why.

973
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:54.640
I don't think you could do it other than say,
wow,
that's what the law said.
Hot,

974
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:56.480
hot twist and hair.
Right?

975
00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.500
It's fucking ridiculous.
Do you know in some states,

976
01:00:02.501 --> 01:00:04.810
if you're riding in a car with,

977
01:00:04.811 --> 01:00:08.230
with like a girl who's not of age and she's in her bare feet,

978
01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:12.880
that's considered statutory rape.
Does that make any fucking sense?
It doesn't,

979
01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:14.290
does it?
Well,
I'm gonna tell you right now,

980
01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:19.410
these fucking divorce laws make as much sense is that they like these old

981
01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:24.220
archaic fucking laws.
This is the thing,
you know,

982
01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:28.630
there's a lot of disadvantages to being a lady.
But you know,

983
01:00:28.631 --> 01:00:33.631
one of the main advantages of being a woman is that you can be an absolute

984
01:00:34.391 --> 01:00:38.140
fucking bomb.
You could be a bum.

985
01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:42.640
You can have no fucking job,
no drive.

986
01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:45.340
You cannot achieve anything in life

987
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:51.980
<v 9>and still come out the other side worth $400 million.</v>

988
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:53.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

989
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.650
<v 9>Do you know what happens to a guy?
If he's a bum,
he's a bum.</v>

990
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.280
He's fucking homeless other than Stedman Stedman.

991
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:05.990
Oprah's fucking whatever the hell he is.

992
01:01:05.991 --> 01:01:10.340
He's the only guy I ever saw that figured out how to be a fucking bum.

993
01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:11.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

994
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.650
<v 9>Oh,
there's a car actually.
Glad.
Let's be fair.
Kevin Federline.</v>

995
01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:19.270
Kevin Federline is a bump.
That guy is a bum.

996
01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:24.490
Brittany Spears even built him his own God damn recording studio and he still

997
01:01:24.491 --> 01:01:28.330
couldn't make a hit.
Right?
Then they get divorced and what does he do?

998
01:01:28.331 --> 01:01:32.080
Sits on his ass and becomes a fat fuck.
You know,

999
01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:36.760
getting Popeye's fried chicken off of Brittany Spears,
alimony payments.

1000
01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.490
He's a bump.
So I guess it can be done.
But come on.
Who's getting hope?

1001
01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:46.390
It's very few and far between.
You know,
I dunno,

1002
01:01:46.391 --> 01:01:48.970
maybe women are coming up.
Maybe they are making more money.

1003
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:50.860
I saw all those Christmas ads,

1004
01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.080
those Lexus ads where these women were buying their guys cars and I got to admit

1005
01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.500
I was sitting there.
I started acting like a woman.
When I saw that commercial,

1006
01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.500
I was like,
yeah,
why don't you buy me a car?

1007
01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.590
Like this fictitious couple that we see on television.

1008
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.960
That really bothered me.

1009
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.960
Seeing that commercial where these women were out there buying cars,

1010
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:14.200
not because my male ego couldn't handle some broad buying me a car.

1011
01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:16.180
It's just the fact that they're putting this out.

1012
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:21.210
There wasn't multiple commercials as if this shit is going on is if there's so

1013
01:02:22.031 --> 01:02:27.031
many fucking women out there by in their fucking men's a car that it's worthy of

1014
01:02:27.671 --> 01:02:30.580
putting it out there like this is some mainstream shit that happens.

1015
01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.540
Hey fellas,
how many guys Honi I'm in.

1016
01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:38.130
Your male friends got a fucking goddamn Volkswagen.

1017
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:39.850
Forget about Lexus for Christmas.

1018
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.880
Anybody you see any of your male friends walking outside screaming like a bitch

1019
01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:48.280
in that bathrobe jumping up and down and look at some shiny new car with a big

1020
01:02:48.281 --> 01:02:51.610
ribbon on it?
Has that ever happened?

1021
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:57.250
I read Oprah.
Did it.
I Bet Brittany did it.
Who else?

1022
01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.370
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1023
01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:02.000
<v 9>Sandra Bullock.
She married a bum.</v>

1024
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.970
Okay.
That's another guy.

1025
01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:12.440
You know those guys out to write a book because they're really treading on some

1026
01:03:12.441 --> 01:03:16.370
female shit.
Like how to live like a Hooters chick as a guy.

1027
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.750
You know how to just be an absolute fucking bum and still come out the other

1028
01:03:20.751 --> 01:03:22.010
side of God damn millionaire.

1029
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:23.530
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1030
01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:27.670
<v 9>I gotta be honest with you.
I couldn't fucking do it if I was a fucking bum.</v>

1031
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:32.130
All right,
let me just look.
Let's just,
let's just say I was married to somebody,

1032
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:34.440
some lady,
right?

1033
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.310
And she's just running some God damn empire coming home every day.

1034
01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:41.100
Dress like fucking Nancy Reagan,
you know,

1035
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:45.480
God damn broach just to let you know how powerful she is and uh,

1036
01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:47.640
she's buying me all this shit.
I have to,

1037
01:03:47.641 --> 01:03:49.650
why I would have to leave the relationship.

1038
01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:55.140
I would have to leave and she'd be like the bill.
You have nothing.
I know.

1039
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.250
That's the point I got.
I got nothing.
I'm a fucking loser.

1040
01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:01.300
I feel like I'm,

1041
01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.320
I feel like I'm 14 years old and I'm still living at home with my parents.

1042
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.130
I can't,
I don't have a job.
I don't have any goals.
I'm not doing anything.

1043
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.080
I'm just fucking sitting here going to the gym.

1044
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.810
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1045
01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:12.643
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1046
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1047
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.730
<v 9>I know what everything costs on the prices,
right.
I sh I should know that.</v>

1048
01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:18.570
Do you understand that?

1049
01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1050
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.000
<v 9>I,
I'm sick of playing tennis with the maid.</v>

1051
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:27.840
I have to do something with my life.
This is fucking pathetic.

1052
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:29.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1053
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.100
<v 9>I know.
I thought it was what I wanted.</v>

1054
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.090
I know I got a fucking blow it on sports bar.

1055
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.820
I love the beers on tap.
I got the NFL,

1056
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:43.821
NBA Nhl and MLB packages and I'm still not happy cause I'm a bum.

1057
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.430
Mrs. Reagan.
All right,
I'm outta here.

1058
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:54.860
Just give me time to find a job in a one bedroom apartment or fucking studio.

1059
01:04:54.861 --> 01:04:58.670
I have to get out of here.
You know,
but these broads,
don't give a fuck.

1060
01:04:59.570 --> 01:04:59.871
Coby.

1061
01:04:59.871 --> 01:05:04.871
Brian's ex wife is a bomb and she's going to be worth close to $200 million.

1062
01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.670
Do you understand that?
Do it.

1063
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.270
He probably probably even won a game of checkers in her life.
You know,

1064
01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.140
maybe she was good at shoots and ladders.
Yeah.
What does she do?

1065
01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:19.200
And I bet she has some bullshit online business.

1066
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.090
That's what those rich broads always do.

1067
01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:24.730
So they can act like they have some fucking business but still stay at home and

1068
01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:28.660
they are fucking jam jams.
And I'm working,
I have a computer,

1069
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.800
you know going to fucking US magazine.com all fucking day.

1070
01:05:34.801 --> 01:05:35.850
You Rub bomb.

1071
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:37.270
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1072
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:40.780
<v 9>Mrs. Whatever your name is Brian,
you're a fucking bum.</v>

1073
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.160
You're a bomb.
Get a fucking job.

1074
01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.610
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1075
01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:50.840
<v 9>The fuck is it going to say on your tombstone?
Suck the right dick.</v>

1076
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.083
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1077
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:57.470
<v 10>Okay.</v>

1078
01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:00.710
<v 9>Oh Man,
I got all of that one.
Uh,
all right,</v>

1079
01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.680
it's now I'm actually sick of talking about it.
Maybe I won't.

1080
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:06.530
Maybe that won't go to state.
Who the fuck knows?
Go to stage.

1081
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:11.360
Did I just say that we're taking this to the stage where having a big
production,

1082
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.830
<v 10>alright.
Dilemmas for the week.</v>

1083
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.080
Go to the bathroom like a cat number one and number two in a dresser drawer

1084
01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:42.430
sized cat box.

1085
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:47.380
And have a butler empty at every day or go to the bathroom like a dog outside in

1086
01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:51.670
the bushes and have a Butler follow you around to pick it up and tell you that

1087
01:07:51.671 --> 01:07:55.660
you're a good boy.
Oh,
that's no fights.
No Fiat that second one.

1088
01:07:57.010 --> 01:08:00.210
I do it outside at squat right down to the fucking bushes,

1089
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:04.480
not shitting inside my house.
That's why I hate cats.

1090
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:10.180
Aside from the fact that they act like stuck up,
cuts at a club,
you know,

1091
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.320
who've never done accomplished anything other than looking good in life,

1092
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:18.260
you know,
and they only come around when they fucking need something.

1093
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.680
The only other reason why I don't like cats and say shit in the fucking house,

1094
01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:27.170
then I get to pick it up.
I don't like that.
They're not happy when I come home.

1095
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:31.040
There's just no,
there's no give and take.
You know what is,
when you have a cat,

1096
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.010
you're basically Robert De Niro's character in casino.

1097
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.350
That's what you are,
you know,
and your cat is Sharon Stone.

1098
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:47.220
She's fucking,
she's just there for the amenities.
You fucking cunt.

1099
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:52.190
Go O D and a Goddamn red roof inn.
All right.
So yeah,

1100
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.100
I would definitely outside.
Who doesn't like being told there were a good boy?

1101
01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.540
I get praise was the last time anybody out there got praise after they took a

1102
01:08:59.541 --> 01:09:04.540
dump.
Wouldn't that be awesome?
You know,
I don't know.

1103
01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:08.390
All right,
let's plow ahead.
Was that unfunny sir?
Did you not like that one?

1104
01:09:08.391 --> 01:09:10.550
Was that not up to your comedy standards?

1105
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:16.090
Did you feel the rest of this podcast was funnier than that when I blew my nose

1106
01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:21.260
before I went off on Jesus.
Oh,
alright.

1107
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:25.420
Let's just plow ahead here.
Number two.
Uh,

1108
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:28.820
would you rather marry a stripper or have your daughter become one?

1109
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:36.200
I'd rather Mary Wood and ran a merry one.
You know,

1110
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.940
if my daughter becomes one,
that's just complete failure as a parrot.

1111
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.730
And in fact that's what I think all those videos,

1112
01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:46.070
it should be called that you see,

1113
01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:49.940
you know when you see on youtube and you got those girls doing those booty

1114
01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:53.000
dances,
you know the god damn shorts up their ass.

1115
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.760
Like it's always like so and so booty dancing.

1116
01:09:55.761 --> 01:10:00.761
What it should be called is so and so complete failure as a pair of well results

1117
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:07.490
of a complete failure as a parent.
Absolutely.
I would rather,

1118
01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:08.690
that's not fair to the kid.

1119
01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.870
I would marry a stripper and uh,
you know,

1120
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:18.890
I would just,
I would just have fun with the stripper.

1121
01:10:18.891 --> 01:10:21.140
I would just do whatever I could,
you know,
fucker is,

1122
01:10:21.141 --> 01:10:25.070
she had one leg pointed west and one leg pointed east,
you know,

1123
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:28.380
or north and south if she's standing up drinking coffee,
you know,

1124
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:33.080
doing like one of those little ballet moves.
I just bang like that and then,
uh,

1125
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.510
yeah,
don't have a kid and be like,
listen,
this is the secret in life,
sweetheart.

1126
01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:43.310
Don't do anything that your mother did when she does become a stripper.

1127
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.400
Is that like a reality show that they haven't come up with yet?

1128
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.490
Daughters of strippers?
Like what's her face?

1129
01:10:49.491 --> 01:10:54.491
I think a Kurt Cobain's daughter is going to be all right because their mother

1130
01:10:54.771 --> 01:10:58.100
is such a fuck up that I think I probably just jinxed her.

1131
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.080
I probably just jinxed her.
Um,
all right.
Number three,

1132
01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:08.510
uh,
choose between attacked by a bear or a lion on land in between.

1133
01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:12.350
Attacked by a shark or a crocodile in the water.
No fucking contest,
dude.

1134
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:16.980
I would take a bear or a lion.
That's a quick death.

1135
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:22.110
That's a quick one.
That bear comes up with that bionic bitch slap.
That's it.

1136
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.950
It fucking breaks your neck.
You ever see a lion kill something?
That's it.

1137
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:27.870
It's over like,

1138
01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:31.830
and that's going after like major prey and it just crushes you.

1139
01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:35.160
Fucking wind pipe.
You're out in two seconds.
Did you ever yell the footage of,

1140
01:11:35.161 --> 01:11:38.430
what's his face?
The Gay Lion Tamer out there.

1141
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.690
The one who looked like,
uh,
uh,

1142
01:11:42.691 --> 01:11:46.200
what's his face from night at the Roxbury?
The AH,

1143
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:49.650
Jesus Christ is fucking cold medicine.
What the fuck is the guy's name there?

1144
01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.050
Come on.
What was,
what's the name of that guy?
Chris Catan.
That one.

1145
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:57.320
The Gay Chris Catan.
Do you ever see when that fucking,

1146
01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:01.880
that lion grabbed that dude and it was over in two seconds.
It would,

1147
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:03.090
he just went limp.

1148
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:08.470
I take that in a second as opposed to a fucking shark.
You sitting out there,

1149
01:12:08.471 --> 01:12:09.181
a shark comes up,

1150
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:13.050
first thing it does is it bites and the leg to see if your edible right just

1151
01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:15.180
takes a nice chunk out in class.
You know,

1152
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:18.420
like it's doing some sort of wine testing with your fucking thigh meat.

1153
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:24.060
You know what else kills me is the fact you can't fucking see it.

1154
01:12:25.410 --> 01:12:26.243
You know,

1155
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.640
your heads above the water and all the evil is just below it and you're sitting

1156
01:12:29.641 --> 01:12:32.040
there,
you know,
and I think that you hit still,

1157
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.410
you got that cavemen DNA that would,

1158
01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.280
that would just be going off that there was something in the area despite the

1159
01:12:38.281 --> 01:12:42.600
fact that you couldn't see it,
you'd be trying to lift your fucking legs up.
I,

1160
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:45.840
I think,
uh,
I think the real dilemma here is,

1161
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:50.550
is between shark or a crocodile and,

1162
01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:55.290
uh,
I,
I would have to go,
I would have to go shark.

1163
01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.850
I just feel like they're,
it's a cleaner death.
You know,

1164
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.310
they got those Ginsu knives,
teeth,

1165
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:06.480
they just come in like a tiger shark is just fucking over,
you know,

1166
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:11.250
just a perfect fucking killing machine as they said in jaws.
But like a

1167
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.600
alligators and crocodiles,
those fucking things.

1168
01:13:15.601 --> 01:13:19.530
Those are like those guys who aren't talent talented enough to be in the NFL,

1169
01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:24.120
the NHL.
So they just go out there and they try to blow out guys knees,
you know,

1170
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:29.820
alligators and crocodiles and like the bill room now skis of fucking predators.

1171
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.930
You know,
just that thing where they grab on to you.

1172
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:38.540
You know what I like about shark?
It you could just bite your leg off.
Ugh.

1173
01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.301
Fucking alligator.

1174
01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:42.900
That they always seem to grab it and then they go into that role and they just

1175
01:13:42.901 --> 01:13:44.730
sold slowly twisted off.
You know,

1176
01:13:44.731 --> 01:13:47.220
like you some cooked chicken and they're trying to take the leg.

1177
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:53.430
This is getting fucking morbid.
That's what I would choose.
All right,

1178
01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:55.580
what else we got here?
Uh,

1179
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.910
have a beautiful lady who stinks,
smelly breath,

1180
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
smelly ass pussy pits,
hair the works,

1181
01:14:03.001 --> 01:14:07.800
all stinking or an ugly fat bitch who smells great.

1182
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.170
Uh,
I go with the ugly fat girls.

1183
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:19.030
Smells great.
Absolutely because I could,

1184
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:19.930
I could love her.

1185
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:24.220
Where the other one who just smelled like shit but was beautiful.

1186
01:14:24.221 --> 01:14:28.180
It was probably carried herself like a beautiful lady would annoy me after a

1187
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:31.760
while and I'd probably kill her,
you know?

1188
01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:33.381
Why did you kill her?

1189
01:14:33.381 --> 01:14:36.880
Because her fucking pussy stunk and she walked around like she was just sell.

1190
01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.380
Am I being charged with that?
He think because if I am,
I want a lawyer.

1191
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.910
Go fuck yourselves.
While Mr. Burns,

1192
01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:46.330
you really just already incriminated yourself.
I don't care.
You know,

1193
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.630
the prison will not smell as bad as her ass.

1194
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:56.230
I was anything worse to fucking cold tea.
All right,
here we go.

1195
01:14:56.430 --> 01:15:00.400
A chimp first linebacker built my friends and I frequently get in an argument

1196
01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:02.260
over whether a worlds,

1197
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:09.120
a world's man competitor or NFL lineman could handle a chimp in a fight.

1198
01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.520
I know chimps can rip faces off at a 10 times the strength of a normal man,

1199
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:16.540
but a normal man is a tub of shit.

1200
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.030
I bet a linebacker could rip some faces off to.
What do you think?
Uh,

1201
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:26.260
yeah,
no contest.
The chimp would fuck the dude up.
Do Chimps don't fight.

1202
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.520
I was going to have a said fairly chimps don't fight like people.

1203
01:15:30.521 --> 01:15:31.800
They're not going to,
you know,
you've got to come out,

1204
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:34.180
come out and touch gloves and they're going to fuck it.
Sorry.

1205
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:36.130
He's got a great jab watch out for it's right.

1206
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.730
You know that fucking thing is just going to jump on you.

1207
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.810
I would tell you that time that monkey stole my hotel keys.

1208
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.080
I was in Costa Rica.
Um,

1209
01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:53.410
the fuck was I down in Costa Rica,
way out in the Bush,
you know,

1210
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:56.710
army ants took over my fucking little Cabana and that type of shit.

1211
01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:00.250
So they had this pet monkey.
There of is a monkey.
I fucking hate monkeys.

1212
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:02.560
I never had a problem with chimps,

1213
01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:05.650
but now that they'd rip people's faces off and then nuts and their feet off,

1214
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.210
I have a problem with them.
Uh,
I like gorillas and I like orangutans.

1215
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:14.230
Orangutans.
I was thought I was tank t a n g but it's wearing a tan.

1216
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:18.190
I like those ones.
They seem like they've seen it all.
They got that vibe.

1217
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:21.400
They could just sit down and teach you about life.

1218
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.400
But those little monkey motherfuckers,
I can't stand it.
Right.

1219
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:27.450
So for some dumb reason,
cause I'm white,
I have to walk up to it.
Hey,

1220
01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.820
there's a fucking wild animal.
Let me put myself in danger.

1221
01:16:30.821 --> 01:16:35.050
And I walk up to this thing and a fucking jumps on me.
Uh,

1222
01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.580
you know,
and it's one of those,
you know,
remember that that video was shocked.

1223
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:44.580
The monkey popup with the little monkey in that day was one of those monkeys or

1224
01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:48.880
the faces of death when they will fucking banging that monkey's head till it

1225
01:16:48.881 --> 01:16:52.540
died than the aide is brains.
Remember that one?
Yeah,
it was one of those monkeys,

1226
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.690
right?
This fucking thing jumped on me.
And within half a second,

1227
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:59.410
it turned itself upside down,
was hanging by its tail from my neck,

1228
01:16:59.411 --> 01:17:04.120
reached in my pockets,
grabbed my keys and ran back up a fucking tree.

1229
01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:10.410
This all happened like within like 1.8 seconds.
So my body like,
what?
Wait,
what?

1230
01:17:10.411 --> 01:17:14.250
What?
Ah,
fuck.
So if this thing actually wanted to fuck you up,

1231
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:17.070
the things that going to come out.
Fuck it.
Bobbing and weaving.

1232
01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.070
It's going to be running around the room,
jumping up off a shit.

1233
01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.610
You got to try to figure out where it is and it's just going to fucking land on

1234
01:17:23.611 --> 01:17:27.090
your face and that's going to be it.
It's going to tear your face off,

1235
01:17:27.091 --> 01:17:30.960
twist your foot off and rip your balls off and no linebacker stands a fucking

1236
01:17:30.961 --> 01:17:34.410
chance unless you know what,
what if they had on the equipment,

1237
01:17:34.411 --> 01:17:35.850
even though they tell you fingers off.

1238
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.420
This is the amazing thing about how human beings survived,

1239
01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:44.940
is everything out there as far as I can tell,
is faster than us.

1240
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:45.953
For the most part,

1241
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:50.130
it is stronger that US faster and stronger,

1242
01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.350
but for the simple fact that we were smarter,

1243
01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.430
we were able to do all the horrific things that we've done with this nature.

1244
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:58.680
You know,
with this nature,
with this planet.

1245
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.000
Yeah,
but think about that shit.

1246
01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:08.640
Football players beat the fuck out of the nerds all through grade school and

1247
01:18:08.641 --> 01:18:09.474
high school.

1248
01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:14.310
Then what happens from the real deal goes down the end of the day.

1249
01:18:14.311 --> 01:18:19.311
Those nerds become bankers and those football players get enslaved there.

1250
01:18:19.771 --> 01:18:23.730
You sit in your house like a caged animal,
like the fucking zoo it.

1251
01:18:23.731 --> 01:18:26.490
Where's that banker?
You don't even know what the fuck he looks like.

1252
01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.980
All those Facebook cunts,
that Goddamn Steve Jobs,

1253
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:34.720
<v 3>the most overrated human beings are the fucking planet they went in yet.</v>
