00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.470
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasts.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.870
<v 1>Ah,
just checking in on them.</v>

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.960
<v 0>Yeah.
What's going on?
I'm here in New York City.</v>

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.480
Be impressed boy.

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.350
Talking about second season of episodes family.

7
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.100
I want to thank everybody at once again.
He's been watching it,
tweeting about it,

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.900
Instagram and about it,

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.010
my space and about his Facebook and whatever the fuck you kids do.

10
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.320
I have no idea.
Um,
I get a long day of press yesterday,
but a great time.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.310
Had a great time.
Did the Howard stern show for the first time in like 15 years?

12
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.773
<v 2>MMM.</v>

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
<v 0>I had a great time on that one.
And then,
uh,
he was funny.</v>

14
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:48.390
I could barely sleep the night before.

15
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.720
I was just thinking about how much my life has changed in the last 15 years.

16
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:53.310
Plus I was on

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.690
west coast time plus I was nervous going in there,
you know,

18
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.450
you go to do that show.
It's like,
oh my God,
what's this guy going to ask me?

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.820
And it ended up going great.
Thank God.
You know,

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.340
that's one of those ones you leave.
It's like,
did he have a good time?

21
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:11.520
But it was it all right.
Did I do an all right job?
Um,

22
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.490
I did joke with them that I'll see him again in another 15 years.

23
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.500
<v 0>But it was obviously fucking awesome to do the show and I had a great time.</v>

25
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:22.620
I hope he had a good time to and uh,

26
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.220
then of course I did Jimmy and say,
am I did the ob show,

27
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:30.940
I'm going to try to do Anthony show today.
Um,

28
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.790
I did Ron Ron show.
I did fucking,
uh,

29
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.030
<v 2>okay.</v>

30
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.140
<v 0>What else did I do?
Barstool sports.
I was everywhere.</v>

31
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:43.760
It did something for the m and m channel.

32
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:47.720
I did the trucker show just running my year.

33
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.810
I called it the major,
Major League baseball channel

34
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.900
and I fucking,

35
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.430
<v 2>okay.</v>

36
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.250
<v 0>For whatever reason,
decided to talk about the Kevin Durant trait</v>

37
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720
<v 1>on baseball</v>

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.860
<v 0>channel.
We totally got into that.
Talk to somebody else on Toronto.</v>

39
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.610
Um,
great game last night,
by the way.
Finally,

40
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:15.611
a nice competitive game between the Cavaliers and the warriors before the former

41
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:21.190
league MVP that they signed.
They hit a fucking dagger three pointer.

42
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.703
<v 2>MMM.</v>

43
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.330
<v 0>I Dunno.
Gravy train,
gravy,
train,
jumping on the,</v>

44
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.410
it's the gravy train championship.
That's what I'm going to call it.
Um,

45
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.420
and I've gotten into so many fucking debates.

46
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.950
A lot of people don't agree with me.

47
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.680
A lot of people go well abroad did at Miami saw.
And I keep saying,

48
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.120
I'm not talking about players,

49
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:45.390
I'm just talking about this as a fan and nobody seems to be able to hear me.

50
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.840
So last night I'm in a fucking diner.
Um,

51
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.160
and I get in this fucking debate with this dude.
You know,

52
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.170
one of these young guys,
you know,
they say,

53
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.800
I don't think the Beatles are that good or I think the Beatles overrated.

54
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.100
And I always tried to tell him,
like,

55
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:05.101
you really not going to find any musician with any sort of knowledge of music

56
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.100
that's going to say you're right.
I think why these kids say this,

57
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:13.090
aside from the fact that it's been so long since the Beatles were around,

58
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.360
that it's hard to go back and see the effect they had on the game.

59
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.100
It's like trying to look back at Johnny Unitas and see how he brought the

60
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.230
quarterback position into the modern era.

61
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.970
How the fuck are you going to do that in 20 high?

62
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.640
He out of these of these goddamn kids going to do it.

63
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.710
I also think the reason why the Beatles get so much shit from people like it

64
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:37.711
seems like age 38 and under is I think baby boomers are so fucking annoying and

65
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:44.140
that's all they talk about.
And they act like music ended,
you know,

66
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.690
in 1970 when they broke up.
But,
um,

67
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.240
I was arguing with this guy,

68
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.060
and this is one of the funniest things anybody's ever said.

69
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.930
It basically said that he didn't like the Beatles because when he puts on the

70
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.090
Beatles that didn't make them want to get on an elliptical and workout.

71
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.510
That has gotta be one of the funniest fucking things.
And I mean,

72
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:14.500
it was just like,
dude,
how many fucking food courts do you sit in at?
Just like,

73
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.160
I don't even know what to say to them.
It's like,
dude,
you know,

74
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.200
everybody likes Mozart,
but you know,

75
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:24.190
it doesn't make me want to put on my leg warmers and get on the exercise bike.

76
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.703
Um,

77
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.850
but who the fuck am I to say how people should or shouldn't enjoy music?
But,

78
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:31.330
um,

79
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.870
I think a lot of the Beatles backlash just has to do with everybody blowing them

80
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:38.800
for the last fucking 50 years.
And people will be like,
dude,

81
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.710
yellow submarine.
That's a good song.
And it's like,
well dude,

82
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:44.980
Al Pachino has bad movies.
Does that mean he's not a fucking,

83
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.800
one of the greatest actors of all time?
You know,

84
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.090
every comedian has a fucking tough set.

85
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.730
Everybody comedian tells a joke that doesn't fucking work.

86
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.320
Richard Pryor did sets where he bombed.
You know,
I,

87
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.140
I don't understand the,
whatever was such a stupid fucking thing I got,

88
00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:04.580
I just literally wasted.

89
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:09.440
I wasted like two hours of my life arguing about what are the Beatles were great

90
00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:10.274
or not,

91
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.050
and whether or not what Durant was doing was,

92
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.590
you know,
a legit championship or not.

93
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.520
I wasted like at least two hours of my fucking life debating with that.

94
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:25.200
Getting nowhere spinning my wheels,

95
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:29.640
the other person argue with and it just fucking went nowhere.

96
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.230
And,
uh,
I dunno,

97
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.160
I got another birthday coming up and I really thought I was past this point in

98
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:39.960
my life.
I don't know why.
Fair enough.
Just didn't pop into my head.

99
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.360
Oh,
I know why.
I know why.

100
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.890
Because I was drinking as always when I'm on the fucking road.

101
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.800
And uh,
I decided,
uh,

102
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.010
this morning when I woke up and I was like,

103
00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:54.870
did I really stay out until four in the morning?

104
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.463
<v 3>You know,</v>

105
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.570
<v 0>trying to just tell somebody why the Beatles are better than oasis in the foo</v>

106
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.810
fighters did.
I really just tried to do that.

107
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.460
That I really sit there and debate fucking the Kevin Durant's rate sometimes at

108
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:16.910
the top of my lungs until four in the fucking morning.

109
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.970
So now I got to do press it to listen to this shit.

110
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.450
I'm not going to work out this morning.
I could've gone down the street.

111
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:26.240
I should've gone to fucking bed,
go back to the room.

112
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.630
That's what I should've done.
I could have gone to bed.
I could have woke up,

113
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.990
gone to the gym.
I could've played drums this morning and I'm not,

114
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.340
it's fucking 12 noon trying to get my shit together.
And you know what

115
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.143
<v 2>have added.</v>

116
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.280
<v 0>I've had it.
I'm fucking shutting it down.
Shutting it down.
Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.380
You know what?
No,
I'm no fun,
William.
That's what I'm going to be.

118
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.460
No Fun.
Billy.
Billy.
No Fun.
There you go.
There's my new name.
Billy.
No Fun.

119
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.020
Oh,
Billy.
Back to the room.
I just,

120
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:03.100
I don't know what a fucking colossal fucking waste.

121
00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:06.220
That's all I can think about this morning.
You guys haven't do that.

122
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.060
You had to have,

123
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.060
am I the only person who does shit like that goes out and stays out way past the

124
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:16.900
time.
He should have stayed on debating stupid shit.

125
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.200
Why do I give a fuck if someone likes the red hot chili peppers over fucking and

126
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.110
I dunno.
Fucking poison.
Why?
Why?

127
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.290
I'm 49 years old on Saturday.

128
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.110
I'm having arguments that I should have been having in like fucking junior high

129
00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:37.944
and high school.

130
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.113
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

131
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.710
<v 0>I want to say it took a long,
hard look at myself,
but I didn't,</v>

132
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.750
I kind of laid here with the fucking lights off,
just going like I can't,

133
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.060
<v 2>uh,
I dunno.</v>

134
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.460
<v 0>Then I'm trying to like make excuses.
Well,</v>

135
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:55.610
I'm just upset because I'm not going to see my daughter for the next couple of

136
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.000
days.
So maybe that caused me to be a little more argumentative and then I had to

137
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.050
really look at myself and be like,
you know,
I built not,

138
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.290
you kind of been a client for a while now.

139
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.400
This predates the birth of your daughter.

140
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.163
<v 2>MMM.</v>

141
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.820
<v 0>So anyways,
no fun Billy.
Oh,</v>

142
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.320
back to the room,
Roger.
That's what I'm going to be.
Uh,

143
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.780
yeah,
it's an I,
I think I'm going to have dinner with an old friend.
Right.

144
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.290
Which sounds like code that I'm going to go out and go do some heroin,
you know,

145
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.290
isn't that code in the junky world?
Where were you for the last six weeks?

146
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.030
I was having dinner with an old friend.

147
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.520
You know,
we eat standing up,
um,
sorry,

148
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.810
sorry for the heroin jokes,

149
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.040
considering it's a goddamn epidemic here in the United States.
Um,

150
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.990
but what kind of agenda?
Actually a function,
functioning Junky,

151
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:57.840
listening to this shit right now.
Um,
do you think you could kick heroin?

152
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.770
You ever see people chicken,
heroin,
and you just think like,
what?
I have it in me.

153
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.550
I mean,
I can't even lay off the booze.
I saw this video one time,

154
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:10.551
this guy just like literally on his knees folded down on top of himself in the

155
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.470
tub,
just feels like with water running over him.

156
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.530
And this woman was sort of giving him shit.
Give me like,
oh,
how do you feel?

157
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.380
He just sorta looks up like,
I can't imagine it,
but,
um,

158
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.540
I've read a couple of rockstars books and they talk about,
you know,

159
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.110
trying to kick heroin and all that stuff.
And I dunno why.

160
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:41.410
It sounds like fascinating.
Whenever I,
uh,

161
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.850
whenever I'm in your arms again,
dude,

162
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:51.800
that songs better than the Beatles,
they're like,
I like dead song.

163
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:54.110
Makes me want to get up and go on a power walk.

164
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.450
<v 4>Uh,
no.
Um,
love you much better this time.</v>

165
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.270
<v 0>Sorry.
Um,
what was I talking about?</v>

166
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.310
Kicking heroin or who the fuck was that?
That I just sink.

167
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.040
That's not Spandau Ballet.

168
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.460
<v 3>Okay.</v>

169
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.620
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

170
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.100
<v 0>I know this,
that was spent.
All right.
Well Gee,</v>

171
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.260
that was a tough summer when that song came out.
You know what I mean?

172
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.170
You'd have a crush on a girl and she pulled up in a car and as much as you love

173
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:33.390
too,
you just couldn't quite love her as much when she pulled up any,

174
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.620
she was listening to that song.

175
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.603
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

176
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.313
<v 0>You know,</v>

177
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.670
it's kind of impossible if you love music to start to start to sing that song

178
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:47.860
without beginning to cry.
It's such a bad song.
Right.

179
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.960
<v 4>Uh,
oh,
I know</v>

180
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.320
<v 0>this.
Sorry.
Um,
anyways,</v>

181
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.150
I want to thank everybody once again as I just mentioned that uh,

182
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.030
helped me come in.
I,

183
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.500
I wasn't there for my eight 45 in the morning until four in the afternoon just

184
00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:07.990
running my Yap about the show and uh,

185
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.790
I got to do it again this afternoon.

186
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.760
Then I have a little more in the morning and then I am done and I have like one

187
00:11:15.761 --> 00:11:20.710
more press thing that I think I'm doing and then that's it.
That's it.

188
00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:24.250
Then I washed my hands of it and if you fucking like it,
you're watching it.

189
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:28.030
If you don't,
you don't.
I apologize for the click here.
Then you go.

190
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.380
It's probably was overly loud.
Um,
I get to look at my fucking notes here.

191
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.880
I think everybody,
uh,
yes,
I did.

192
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.050
I talked about the guy with the elliptical.
Yes,
I did.
Um,

193
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.470
I've actually been paying attention a little bit to the Red Sox,
Yankees,

194
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.170
the Red Sox,
the new evil empire,

195
00:11:47.171 --> 00:11:51.250
$210 million coming down and playing these upstart Yankees,
you know,

196
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.270
all from the farm system,
the Anti Golden State Warriors.

197
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.740
You know what I mean?
You know what the Yankees,
the Yankees in like 99,

198
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:03.550
2000 till like,
I don't know,
2009,

199
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:06.010
2010 right to the end of George Steinberg,
his life.

200
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.820
That was like when Hulk Hogan has,
you know,

201
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.290
he still has the blonde mustache,
but his beard is black.
You know,

202
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.480
he's the bad guy.
And right now what the Yankees are doing,

203
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:20.980
they're like Hulk Hogan when he has just the blonde mustache and he's a good guy

204
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.670
and he's wearing the red with the orange writing on his fucking ass shorts.

205
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.350
He's not wearing the black shit,

206
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.680
letting you know that for some reason he's in an evil place.

207
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.750
And the the red sox right now,
the red sox got the black beard.

208
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:38.600
We are the black bear.

209
00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:43.030
Did fucking blood mustache version of Hulk Hogan come into town.

210
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.300
Throw enough fucking money all over the place,
you know?
Um,

211
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.840
I dunno.
Well,
so we'll see.
But we got to fucking asses kicked last night.

212
00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:56.360
I think we won the night before.
I'm starting to pay attention.

213
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.930
I'm going to get the fucking MLB package.

214
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.160
I'm going to see what $210 million does.
Um,

215
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.140
you know,
I actually think it's,
you know,
he's probably going to be bad.

216
00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:12.140
I'm going to sit there and thinking about having my daughter on my lap watching

217
00:13:12.141 --> 00:13:16.940
those games.
I think there's not enough movement for a toddler,
the toddler,

218
00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:21.260
I guess a baby to appreciate.
That's what's great about hockey by the way.

219
00:13:21.261 --> 00:13:25.850
How about those predators coming back and tying up the series?
How about that?

220
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.940
You know,
I'd be very excited if I was a Predator is fan,

221
00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:31.490
but I would still be nervous obviously playing the penguins.

222
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.790
And I'll tell you why was because of the way Crosby's celebrated that breakaway

223
00:13:37.131 --> 00:13:38.900
goal the other night.

224
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.500
I loved that he just went in a fucking scores the goal and rather than flipping

225
00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:46.420
out ages,

226
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:51.230
she puts his arms out to the side to bring in the teammates.
Like all right,

227
00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:56.231
there's one like total fucking business look on his face.

228
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:56.721
You know,

229
00:13:56.721 --> 00:13:59.600
every time the Predator score they're doing like the fucking mock Reyna.

230
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.090
You know what I mean?
They're doing the electric slide,

231
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.460
they've fist pump and they're going crazy.

232
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:07.370
They're a Christ are a bunch of Goddamn kids acting like they never been there

233
00:14:07.371 --> 00:14:08.680
before.
And you know what?
They haven't,

234
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.870
and I'm not saying that they're going to lose this series,

235
00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:16.871
but I would be very concerned if I was the coach of the predators looking at

236
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.050
how,
you know,
cause we just had that fucking assess and look in his face.

237
00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:26.850
So what do you think?
What does it game five?
If you like competition,

238
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:31.560
I would watch the Stanley Cup final rather than finals or final versus the NBA

239
00:14:31.561 --> 00:14:33.660
finals.
I always forget which one's plural.

240
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.030
<v 3>Okay.</v>

241
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:39.590
<v 0>Somebody last year fucking goes,
there's only one final.
There's not too.</v>

242
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:44.250
And so like,
all right,
well they call it the end.
They call it the NBA finals.

243
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.630
I believe one of them,
one of them is fucking plural.
Um,

244
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.160
but the cat game last was fucking great.

245
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.440
I was going nuts and right until the guy damn end,
until Duran,
that beast,

246
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.580
you know,
we had that fucking three,
but he really is a fucking monster.

247
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.340
Just a phenomenal player.
Oh my God.

248
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:07.370
Would it be great if he was still on the thunder?
Can you imagine the series,

249
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:10.220
the rematch they would have had,
you know,

250
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.030
they should do that with like a superhero movie.

251
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.910
It just have like superman join Lex Luther

252
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.720
and then they just fly around and run around.

253
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:27.080
Just beating the shit out of people.
Can aleks was Lex Luthor tough.

254
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.460
What exactly was that guy?
He really had no super powers.

255
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:35.960
He just was a really negative dude.
Right.
And you comicon people.

256
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:37.190
Can you help me out on that one?

257
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.303
<v 3>Okay.</v>

258
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.940
<v 0>He somehow,
I don't know.
What is the,</v>

259
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:45.800
it was just sort of an asshole who had hookups to uh,
that green shit.

260
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:50.570
Superman doesn't like the fuck.
Is it algae?
Is it a Kale?

261
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.960
What is it that he kryptonite.
Kryptonite.
Yeah.

262
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.750
You know what I mean?
I don't get that.
Like it comes from the planet.

263
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.200
Krypton right.
Isn't that as natural environment?

264
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:07.200
I actually think that that's lazy writing.
You know,

265
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.950
it comes to the planet Krypton and his one weakness is crip.

266
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.300
Todd.
Yeah,
I'm from Earth.

267
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.730
I have super powers in,
but just don't get me anywhere near Earth.
Earth though.

268
00:16:23.731 --> 00:16:28.380
Night.
Oh,
that's it.
Oh my freckles fall off.
I can't tell jokes anymore.

269
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.050
Maybe that's why this podcast sucks so bad right now.

270
00:16:31.051 --> 00:16:35.760
Not because I'm fucking hating what I've done over the last fucking 12 hours to

271
00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:39.400
myself.
Maybe it has to do with the fact that uh,

272
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:45.150
there's some earth tonight here in my,
my plant.
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,

273
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.820
plowing ahead here.
Um,

274
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.260
<v 3>okay.</v>

275
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.020
<v 0>After I do the press today and after I do the press to Myra,
um,</v>

276
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.450
I'm going up to Montreal doing two shows on my birthday,
you know,

277
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.470
this is the loneliness of the road.
I just have to like,
um,

278
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.130
you got to steer into it sometimes and just see the humor in it.

279
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.990
I wanted to the drug store right.
And I was walking through the aisles,

280
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:13.520
they're trying to find some Burt's bees wax for my fucking dried out lips,

281
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:14.631
you know,

282
00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:17.400
cause I haven't been drinking enough water or whatever the fuck being a goddamn

283
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.730
idiot out here.
And um,

284
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.300
I walked by this aisle and I saw that they had those numbers.

285
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.320
You know that you put on a birthday cake.
That's it.

286
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:32.650
I bought a four and a nine and I'm going to buy myself on Friday cause I'm not

287
00:17:32.991 --> 00:17:33.561
going to have time.

288
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:38.561
I don't think on my birthday and I'm going to fucking buy myself light those,

289
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.650
and I'm going to take a Selfie of me with this sad look on my face with a little

290
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:45.830
piece of cheesecake.

291
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.040
Happy Birthday to me,
Abby birthday to me.

292
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.200
Ooh.
Um,
anyways,
how,

293
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.500
Oh shit.
I don't know how far into this fucking podcast.
I,

294
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.010
this always happens when I go to do this.
All right,
let me,
uh,

295
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.940
let me read the advertising.
Okay.
And I've been getting a ton of shit.

296
00:18:09.941 --> 00:18:14.620
Evidently I'm going here.
I'm going to fucking hard on these,
these advertisers.

297
00:18:14.621 --> 00:18:16.420
So you know,
in the,

298
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.480
in the spirit of the fact that my daughter is going to go to a z [inaudible],

299
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.940
I like daughter's going to go to fucking

300
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.363
<v 2>mmm</v>

301
00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.570
<v 0>college one day,
God knows what the fuck that's going to forget college,
right?</v>

302
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.350
Forget Paris.
They fucking,
what are you going to do now?

303
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:39.410
Now you gotta you gotta pay the Vig,
the secondary and the like kindergarten,

304
00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.030
you've got his pay link.
You know,

305
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.930
La Schools is so bad if you don't get them in pro and you got to get them in

306
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:49.740
private school and the very beginning you got to start paying into the system

307
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.050
and that gives you a better fucking chance.

308
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.620
Just a better chance of them getting into don't elementary school or middle

309
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:01.080
school.
It's such a such a rip off.

310
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:02.820
I don't know what's happening in public schools.

311
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.870
Is it because the overhead is like so much worse.

312
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:10.200
I was talking about this on somebody's,
Oh Pete Dominick show.

313
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.050
Thank you to him for letting me in on his show.
Um,

314
00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.170
Pete Dominick show the,
uh,
we were talking about that like when I was a kid,

315
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.960
way back fucking win,
you know.

316
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

317
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.340
<v 0>When you went to public school,</v>

318
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.940
like they just had these fucking textbooks that they just kept giving people

319
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:31.740
year after year after year.

320
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.530
Like I remember the late seventies and just seeing like,
like 78,

321
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.101
you know,

322
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:42.120
and you'd see this holistic kids who had it and they would just have like,

323
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:45.230
you know,
77 78 would be me than somebody.

324
00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:50.100
The year before was 76 77 and we'd go all the way back to like the early sixties

325
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:54.450
or mid sixties so they buy textbooks like once every 15 years.

326
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.100
You know your mother went out and bought you a new pair of sneakers and a couple

327
00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:01.080
pairs of Toughskins right.

328
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.200
You had hand downs shirts from the older brother and all you had to do show up

329
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:07.510
with a fucking pencil and you are ready to get an,
I don't know.
They had,

330
00:20:07.511 --> 00:20:09.620
they had paper,
that's what they need.

331
00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:14.010
They need the need paper or whatever and he's just,
you know,

332
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:17.640
hand out these fucking old textbooks.
That was it.
That's all they had to do.

333
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.480
And I'm now the kids,
what do they got?
They got to have,

334
00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:24.960
they've got to have the phones,
they got to have the fucking iPads,

335
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:26.340
computers and all this shit.

336
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:27.933
<v 2>MMM.</v>

337
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.000
<v 0>Maybe that's what it is.
The overhead for each fucking kid is like,</v>

338
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.420
like the amount of money that they spend on like one kid is probably what they

339
00:20:37.421 --> 00:20:40.600
spent on like a hundred
well,
Bill,

340
00:20:40.601 --> 00:20:42.900
did you do any research to see if that math worked out?

341
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:46.810
Of course not the fuck podcasts you'd think you're listening to this on.

342
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.490

375
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:02.650
I think I can be even more pleasant

376
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.280
lift when you drive the right ride sharing app.

377
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.840
Every trip can feel like a walk in the park with Lyft.

378
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.520
I can't do this shit with Lyft.

379
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:18.130
You can pick your own hours and work when you want.

380
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:22.150
Lift can make driving the best job in the world lift.
You know what?

381
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:25.690
I wish they had this when I was a kid because I would have done this and I had

382
00:23:25.691 --> 00:23:30.691
an 83 Ford ranger and I would either have some Weirdos sitting next to me or I

383
00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:34.390
would just throw him in the back of the truck.
Sorry ladies.

384
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.250
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating it's people better.

385
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.870
Lift believes that being a ride sharing drivers should be fun if you're having a

386
00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:47.100
good time.
So are the passengers.
Um,
if you shoot,

387
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.600
if you're choosing a ride sharing company to drive for,

388
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.700
go with the company that treats you better.

389
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.710
Lift lift operas in APP tipping will you drive for Lyft?

390
00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:59.960
You could keep 100.
We showed the tips.

391
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.200
Drivers have been paid over $150 million in tips since the feature was

392
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:11.630
introduced.
Isn't that amazing that that level of cash even exists out there?

393
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.620
Express?
Well I guess there's over 300 million people out there,
Bill.

394
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:19.100
And if every other person had a dollar,
you'd have 150 million.

395
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.490
Express pay lets drivers get paid,

396
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.340
paid almost instantly instead of waiting for weeks.

397
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.940
A Lyft has taken the guesswork out of pickups.

398
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:32.630
The new APP devices uses color coding to help passengers find their drivers.

399
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.650
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips,
want to make more money,

400
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.220
drive more.
It's been never been easier to give yourself a raise.

401
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.570
It's as simple formula happy drivers being happy pass and Jews man.

402
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.840
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 lift drivers get a perfect five star rating.

403
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.400
I want to happen to the other guy so that joint.

428
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.430

These guys who were in a one bedroom apartment,

If you don't have life insurance,

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.440
what would happen financially if something happened to the primary earner?
Dude,

You have to do it.

you know,
something.

489
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.570
You don't want your last dying words on this side of the road to look in your

wife's eyes and say,

<v 6>Oh,</v>

523
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.300
<v 0>who's coming down the street?
Who's got freckled feet?</v>

524
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.490
It's Billy and he's happened.
No Fun.

525
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.740
That's who I'm going to be over the next fucking,
I dunno how long.
Oh,
Billy,

526
00:32:27.741 --> 00:32:31.220
no fun.
What can I do to improve my life?

527
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.230
I know have less fun.
That's how it works.
That's what aging is.

528
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:40.460
You know what my problem is?
Lately I've been having much fun,
but the problem is,

529
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.660
is once you're a fucking adult,
you know,
and you,
once you move out,

530
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.630
your parents aren't,
your mothers are not there anymore to tell you to,

531
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.250
you know the fucking knock it off.
You have to have your own.

532
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.340
You gotta be your own fucking parent.
I think I used to do a bit on this.

533
00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:00.010
Am I becoming a parody of myself?
Do you guys believe in that?

534
00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.170
Can you be a parody yourself or is it does,

535
00:33:02.171 --> 00:33:05.530
what it really means is you figured people would have figured you out and

536
00:33:05.531 --> 00:33:06.640
they're used to what you do.

537
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.083
<v 2>MMM.</v>

538
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.400
<v 0>How can you be impersonating yourself?</v>

539
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.000
Didn't that guy from fucking Creedence Clearwater revival.

540
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.450
Then you get sued for sounding like claim credence.
John Fogarty,

541
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.290
his former managers sued him for sounding too much like Creedence Clearwater

542
00:33:22.291 --> 00:33:25.290
revival.
And he actually,
he actually,
he actually had to go to fucking trial.

543
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:30.090
How many times that I'd just say actually new drinking game every time bill
says,

544
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.770
actually you have to do a shot laughing my ass off while shaking my head.

545
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.670
Um,
yeah,
John Forgeard,

546
00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:40.440
he actually got fucking sued for sounding like too much like Creedence

547
00:33:40.441 --> 00:33:41.550
Clearwater revival.

548
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:46.230
I think that he had a first ballot hall of fame

549
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.990
fucking piece of shit manager.
You know what I mean?

550
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.130
He had one of the worst managers of all God damn time is what I'm trying to say.

551
00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.180
Um,
I'm turning this day around people.
This is the new silver.
Me.

552
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.280
Who's that walking down the street?
That's a new,
a new theme song.

553
00:34:03.281 --> 00:34:07.160
Who was the guy with the freckled fee?
It's Billy and he's having no fun.

554
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.790
I'm going to sing that to my wife.
That's how I'm going to wake her up.
Um,

555
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:13.370
she likes to silly song.
Do you like a silly song?

556
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:17.210
Do you like the songs that make the whole world sing?
I have a new song for you

557
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.290
now.
You maybe heard of this band.
Okay.
No,

558
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:23.650
I'm not saying there was good as a waste.
This,

559
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.400
I'm not saying there is good as Nickelback.
All right.

560
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.770
I don't want to start a fucking debate here,

561
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.600
<v 2>but um,</v>

I believe it's called hip parade and a,

564
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:44.220
I think that's what you're going to be listening to.

567
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.450
He was the first guy that told me about them and I've seen them in concert two

568
00:34:54.451 --> 00:34:58.320
or three times.
They're absolutely fucking amazing.

I don't know if this is going to make you want to get on an elliptical.

570
00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:06.410
I dunno if this band passes the leg warmer test that my buddies,

571
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.290
you know,
use when they listened to the bench.
Um,
I,

572
00:35:10.291 --> 00:35:13.770
but I do think that this will actually make you want to at least,
I dunno,

573
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.300
maybe touch the toes a couple of times.
I have no idea.
Please enjoy new math.

574
00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.960
Please enjoy your weekend.
You can't.
I'm going to Montreal,

575
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.490
one of my favorite cities,

576
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.140
and on Sunday I'm going to the Formula One race and I'm going to watch the

577
00:35:28.141 --> 00:35:31.140
Ferrari's in the Mercedes.
Is,
is,
is,
is,
is it?

578
00:35:31.141 --> 00:35:33.210
All those fucking guys driving around the track.

579
00:35:33.211 --> 00:35:36.410
It's going to be fucking amazing.
I cannot believe that I'm going to that and

580
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.750
that's it.
I'm continuing with my privileged white male life,

581
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.670
you know,
it's unbelievable.

582
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.830
And I only wish people who weren't white male heterosexuals could understand.

583
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.190
Just like you do have any fucking idea what it's like to be me right now.

584
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.980
I'm going to open my door.
Okay.

585
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.840
And there's going to be a little gold coin and a USA Today given to me by the

586
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:04.920
government.
I shouldn't tell you this,
but that's what,
that's how white I am.

587
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.210
<v 5>Okay.</v>

588
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.190
<v 0>The government,
thanks me every day for it.</v>

589
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.530
All right,
go fuck yourself.
So I'll talk to you on Monday.

590
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:19.850
I just tried to touch my screen like this is my iPhone.
I love Billy.

591
00:36:19.851 --> 00:36:23.240
No Fund has to kick into overdrive here.
All right.
Enjoy the music.

592
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.360
<v 8>Slow</v>

593
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.040
<v 5>to me.</v>

594
00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.590
<v 7>Happy Birthday to me.
Happy Birthday.</v>

595
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.680
Happy Birthday to

596
00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.120
<v 2>me.</v>

597
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.930
<v 7>What's going on?
It's bill births,</v>

598
00:38:10.931 --> 00:38:14.840
the Monday morning podcast that I'm actually doing on Wednesday,

599
00:38:14.841 --> 00:38:19.560
June 10th,
2009,
uh,

600
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.050
my 41st birthday.
And uh,

601
00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:28.110
I'm on the road and I'm going to be on the road here for Awhile and uh,

602
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.950
I'm on the road for a month and I didn't bring my microphone.

603
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.270
I didn't bring my,
I didn't bring any of that shit.

604
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:40.450
So the next four podcasts are going to sound like this,

605
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:45.670
which isn't too bad,
but it isn't too great either.
But um,

606
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.190
yeah,

607
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:52.190
it's my fucking birthday and I'm a New York City and I'm all by myself and uh,

608
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:56.440
I don't give a fuck,
you know,

609
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.890
I'm going to go eat some oatmeal and take a walk in the park,

610
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:05.200
like a fucking old bastard.
Jesus Christ 41.

611
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:09.250
What happened?
Um,
anyways,

612
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.170
for those of you new to my page,

613
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.800
this is the Monday morning podcasts that I usually do on Monday,

614
00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:18.530
and then I can't figure out how to fucking upload it.
So it usually,

615
00:39:18.531 --> 00:39:23.370
it doesn't come out until Tuesday or sometimes until Wednesday.
And,

616
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.140
uh,
for my 14,
actually 13,

617
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:30.790
after that fucking chick flipped out on me last week,
my 13 listeners,

618
00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:33.970
fuck that there's got gotta be still 14.
Somebody came on this week.

619
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:38.890
I like saying 14.
So for my 14 listeners out there,
um,

620
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.470
the reason why it's taken me till Wednesday to,
uh,

621
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:47.550
put this thing up is because I'm on Monday.

622
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.240
Some of you might've seen,

623
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:54.270
I did the tonight show with Conan O'brien and I had the unbelievable honor of

624
00:39:55.031 --> 00:40:00.031
being the first comedian to be on the tonight show under the Conan O'brien

625
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:04.180
regime.
Um,

626
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.530
it went awesome.
I kind of felt like I was eating my balls up front.

627
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.430
But uh,
you know,
when your first joke,

628
00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:15.670
the first punchline is that's what she get.
Your dumb bitch.

629
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.830
I don't know how many laps you can expect.
If I could have done the set over,

630
00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:25.831
I probably would have probably opened with the thing about the girl at the

631
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:29.380
restaurant commenting on how many Asians were in the restaurant.

632
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.120
But then that would have been weird because,
uh,

633
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.970
what would the first laugh be?
This is going to seem oddly racist.

634
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.000
And then I was like,
well,

635
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:48.190
this is going to be awesome.
And if I s that was my first joke,

636
00:40:48.191 --> 00:40:49.690
then they'd be like,
wow,
it was this guy,

637
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.720
like openly racist is just what the tonight show under the Conan O'brien regime

638
00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.620
is going to be like.
But uh,
now it was,
it ended up going great.

639
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:00.701
Um,

640
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:05.701
I finally got him on board right after I was trashing children and I started

641
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:09.970
talking about microchipping people and then they got on board and it went great

642
00:41:09.971 --> 00:41:12.300
right after that.
And uh,

643
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:16.660
the setups and credible and uh,
it was,

644
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.070
it was awesome man.

645
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:23.070
I'm looking forward to hopefully doing 9,000 more because it was a,

646
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.560
I dunno,
it was quite a rush.

647
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:32.130
And for those of you who aren't comedians and you want to know what it's like to

648
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:36.320
do something like that,
um,
those sets are actually,

649
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.820
for me anyways,
they find those that there are a lot harder than,
um,

650
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:46.870
than actually doing half hour or hour specials because,

651
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:51.470
um,
it's only four and a half minutes.

652
00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:55.850
You can't curse.
And it's so easy to bomb.

653
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.880
It's,
it's literally the standup version.

654
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:03.290
You just walking out there with a gun to your head for basically four and a half

655
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:07.940
minutes.
Go and have my funny,
ah,
may still funny.
How about now?

656
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.630
Did you like that one?
Oh,
thank God.
Good night.

657
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.710
That's basically the way it is and this is the first time.

658
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.200
Um,
I've had to work out a four and a half minutes set in Los Angeles,

659
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:25.130
which is a difficult thing to do and I want to thank the,
uh,

660
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:29.120
the Improv and the comedy store for,
uh,

661
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.420
letting me run the set of a bunch of times.
But,
uh,

662
00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.720
it was la crowds are not New York crowds.

663
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.800
I don't want to start a little fucking biggie Tupac thing going on here.
But,
uh,

664
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.370
one of the last times I did my fucking set,

665
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:49.250
I went on in front of like eight people and I'm literally waiting to go on.

666
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:54.230
And this girl comes in bleach blonde hair.
She's talking on her cell phone,

667
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:59.300
walking right up to the second row is some poor bastards on stage.

668
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:03.320
Just eaten his balls or doing whatever you're doing in front of eight people.

669
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:05.990
Right.
And you know,

670
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.490
she's one of the eight and she's walking in on her phone,
completely oblivious,

671
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.500
not talking loud,
but you know,

672
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:18.440
I was just laughing to myself going like that as a classic La moment right
there.

673
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:23.470
So then I went up to run my set and I'm thinking,
ah,

674
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.560
you know,
this was literally the night before I was going to do it.

675
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:29.000
And I was like,
all right,

676
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.690
don't like the fact that there's only eight people in the crowd.
Fuck with you.

677
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.360
You know,
just do your thing.
Just commit to everything.
This is no joke,

678
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:42.860
you know,
before we're doing it tomorrow night.

679
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.920
And I went up and I proceeded to ever so slowly just munch my balls for fucking

680
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.260
five minutes or whatever.
And uh,

681
00:43:55.130 --> 00:44:00.080
to the end,
to the point where I got to the final joke and I didn't even say it,

682
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.940
I just said,
you know what?
You people suck.

683
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:08.290
And then I started ripping on the girl with the blonde hair and the cell phone

684
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:12.920
and she's like,
Oh my God,
I'm sorry.
And I'm like,
no,
you're not.

685
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:17.690
You're just embarrassed.
Okay.
I hate when people do that.
You know,

686
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.860
you're calling them out on their stuff.
Oh God,
I didn't realize.

687
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.740
How do you not know how fucking rude that is.

688
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:28.340
I think I said to wear it to the crowd,

689
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.410
the can't even say the crowd to the group,

690
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.520
to the family of seven,
the other seven fucking people.
I was like,
you knew,

691
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:40.521
imagine being that good looking where you're not even aware that that's rude to

692
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:42.150
do something like that.
I mean,

693
00:44:42.151 --> 00:44:45.690
I'm talking like walking right up to the stage on your cell phone.

694
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.700
She didn't seem to be talking.
Maybe she was just listening to messages.

695
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.780
Maybe I was just freaking out because,
uh,
every other time I did my set,

696
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:57.540
I was fucking bombing.
So anyways,

697
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:02.570
so I ended my set on the tonight show and I felt like I bombed just cause up

698
00:45:03.671 --> 00:45:06.390
front,
you know,
they were a little quiet and um,

699
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.790
but I knew I pulled it out,

700
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:12.990
but everybody was nice at the show and everybody was thrilled.
So I was thrilled.

701
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.270
And,
um,
I had a real embarrassing moment after I got off stage was,

702
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:23.070
it's weird when you do those things,
it,
it,
they just go by so fucking fast.

703
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.780
And I literally,
you know,

704
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:31.980
they wrapped up the end of the show and a as always,

705
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:36.870
whenever I stand next to Conan I look like I'm five foot two and that half the

706
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:39.360
emails I get are great set.
Wow.

707
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:44.361
Conan is really tall and yes he is really tall and no I am not five foot five.

708
00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:48.750
I'm about five foot 10 just under and uh,

709
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.790
I don't know what the fuck he is but um,
he was a tall individual.

710
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:58.290
So anyways,
so I walk off stage in all my,
you know,
manager,
agent and

711
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.290
all these people in my girlfriend is staying there and I'm so like fucking like

712
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.770
was it good?
Was it good?
Everyone was going,
good job,
good job.

713
00:46:07.771 --> 00:46:10.830
And I shook everybody's hand and my girlfriend lived,
literally goes,

714
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.820
great job honey.

715
00:46:11.821 --> 00:46:16.740
And I shook her hand like she was a fucking a PA

716
00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.450
and she literally goes,
you're shaking my hand,
what the fuck?

717
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:28.410
And then everyone started laughing at me and I was really,
really embarrassed.

718
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:32.970
I felt like an idiot.
And I tried to explain how I was.
I was in my head and uh,

719
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:34.110
I dunno.

720
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:39.110
Then I realized that did go awesome and everyone was smiling and I knew it went

721
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:42.960
great.
I could just tell just the way white people,
people,
you know,

722
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:47.550
when it doesn't go great,
there's not a bunch of people standing there backstage.

723
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.950
And when,
you know,
there are people,

724
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:54.240
they tend to be looking down at the floor or acting as though they have to get

725
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:55.920
out of there.
No,
no,
no.
It was good.
It was good.

726
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:59.100
And then they fucking beat it and then you want to fucking jump off a building.

727
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.460
So fortunately that didn't happen and I got a ton of great emails of people

728
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.570
complimenting me on my set.

729
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:11.610
I want to thank everybody who sent those in because uh,
you know,
that was a,

730
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:16.530
that was a really,
you know,
first guy to be on the Conan O'brien tonight show.

731
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:21.420
I got to tell you guys that's as big as anything I've done.
So,
uh,

732
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:24.600
I'm flying pretty high right now and a,

733
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:28.110
I want to thank all you guys for all the really supportive great emails that you

734
00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:32.720
guys sent me.
It,
you know,
I was definitely uh,

735
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.670
one of those points in your career where you sit back for a second,

736
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:40.160
make sure you're taking in.
So I want to thank everybody and uh,

737
00:47:40.161 --> 00:47:42.070
I'd read all the good emails but uh,

738
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.740
those ones are never funny but you know what are funny are the ones when I get

739
00:47:45.741 --> 00:47:49.580
trashed.
So why don't I read one of those?
Okay.
Okay.
Um,

740
00:47:49.581 --> 00:47:51.910
this is an email,
um,

741
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:56.950
that is about my tonight show set and it is titled in all capitals.

742
00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:03.530
No more shiny suits.
All right,
here we go.

743
00:48:03.531 --> 00:48:06.890
So strap in for this one.
Bill,

744
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:09.770
I was so happy to see you on Kona tonight.

745
00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.540
I am a huge fan for years and I was so excited to see you perform.

746
00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:19.370
But what the fuck are you thinking with the shiny suits?

747
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:24.970
There's shiny gray suit with the shiny purple shirt was positively all capitals

748
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.020
distracting.

749
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.430
Whoever is in charge of your wardrobe needs to be cut.

750
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.810
If it is your girlfriend,
she needs to understand the east coast,

751
00:48:35.811 --> 00:48:38.300
west coast different difference.

752
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:41.900
La is pretty much a bunch of,

753
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:46.670
I don't know what this word is.
P.
R.
O.
G.
E.
N.
Y.

754
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:49.303
[inaudible].

755
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:54.210
She tried to say phony anyways is a bunch of uh,

756
00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:59.040
somethings of Hollywood or Stanford or modeling companies.

757
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:04.790
You are the Boston blue collar hockey loving reality spewing comedian,

758
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:06.503
comedian.

759
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:11.190
You are the dude who only wears a suit to funerals and maybe weddings.

760
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.880
Am I,
I didn't know that.
If it was Conan show.

761
00:49:14.881 --> 00:49:17.730
Who made you aware that they are idiots?

762
00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.650
Oh,
have you know sweetheart,
I love suits and I love wearing them.

763
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:30.080
I love that.
I'm the blue code blue collar.
I can fucking barely hammer a nail.

764
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.480
What?
Cause I say fuck a lot.
I love how people just,

765
00:49:33.481 --> 00:49:37.760
they just think like you're this one dimensional individual.

766
00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.580
I do love hockey,
but that doesn't mean I can't wear a suit.

767
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.550
I don't even know it.
Are you doing like a caricature of,

768
00:49:46.551 --> 00:49:49.160
of of a person really?

769
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.880
He says fuck a lot.
That means he only weighs two.
All right.

770
00:49:53.881 --> 00:49:57.090
Let's just read the rest of the,
sorry if it was Conan show,
right.
Okay.

771
00:49:57.091 --> 00:50:00.930
The battery joke was great,
but otherwise I could not stop thinking,

772
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:05.490
why is he wearing that shiny suit?
What's going on?

773
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.200
Was that really what you were thinking?
You're watching me.

774
00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:16.590
I can see you going.
Why is he wearing that shiny suit?

775
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.380
But did you literally think what's going on?

776
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.110
Did you think something happened like they fuck it.

777
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.980
They stuck a microchip on the back of my head.
What's on?

778
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.770
What have they done to him anyways?

779
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.620
You dated yourself so much,

780
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:38.840
especially since you are growing your hair again,
which I think is a great idea,

781
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.771
sweetheart.

782
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:46.460
I'm actually growing it because I'm doing a small part in a movie and they asked

783
00:50:46.461 --> 00:50:50.660
me to grow it back out and the second it's over,
I'm shaving it again.

784
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.370
All right,
so,
uh,
going,
I'm glad you think it's a great idea.
Anyways,

785
00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:00.230
wearing a suit,
you did not look like yourself at all.
Capital Letters.

786
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:05.530
I have been a fan since I saw you on the Cam Neely special over 15 years ago and

787
00:51:06.141 --> 00:51:09.380
you have always been that guy who says what everyone thinks,

788
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:13.760
but please do not ever wear that suit on stage again.

789
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:19.210
Jesus Christ was at that bad.
Anyways,

790
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.900
your comedy is very street quotes,

791
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:27.990
every man quotes and socially and racially inclusive,

792
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:34.230
but to see you wearing an awful shiny early nineties outfit was almost

793
00:51:34.331 --> 00:51:37.330
heartbreaking,
but even even worse,

794
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.510
it was all capitals distracting.

795
00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:45.700
I just kept thinking,
good God,
he is a cute guy.

796
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.280
What the Hell is he wearing?

797
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:54.580
You thought all this and four and a half fucking minutes if keeps going.

798
00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.473
Here we go.

799
00:51:55.810 --> 00:52:00.190
It is part of your routine to be the regular guy in quotes.

800
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:05.120
Quotes again.
Regular guys do not wear suits on Monday night.

801
00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.623
<v 2>Sorry.</v>

802
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.760
<v 7>Get on your jeans and casual,</v>

803
00:52:10.761 --> 00:52:13.730
buttoned down shirt and your audience will laugh again.

804
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:19.580
What did you have a feed to?
Everyone who enjoys my comedy anyways,

805
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.980
uh,
she said,
I'm in New York City.

806
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.370
The opinion that La tried to start trends,

807
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:31.390
what the opinion that La tried to start trends but only New York City can do.

808
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:36.170
It is true.
Bring back the real bill burr.

809
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.150
I love the real bill.

810
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:42.500
<v 2>How fucked up is that?</v>

811
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:49.020
<v 7>I just emailed her back and I just wrote,
you are out of your mind.</v>

812
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.670
Um,
God,
there was so much fucking hilarious shit.

813
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:57.120
I love that she felt it was so distracting.
I thought what it was over.

814
00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.030
Please do not ever wear a suit on stage again.
I,

815
00:53:00.031 --> 00:53:03.330
you would think that at that point,
you know,
27 paragraphs,

816
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:08.310
she had made her point and she goes back into it again saying,
I'm very street.

817
00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.160
Very every man sweetheart.
You don't know anything about me.

818
00:53:11.161 --> 00:53:14.460
I grew up in the suburbs.
It was very safe.

819
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.160
My parents are professionals.
Uh,

820
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:21.780
we just happened to grow up in a blue collar town.
I lived on the east coast.

821
00:53:21.781 --> 00:53:24.990
So all of us sound like we understand plumbing.
I,

822
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.020
I do have a little toolbox.
Um,

823
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:33.510
my knowledge of car engines are as changing the oil and the air filter.

824
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:35.610
I tried to change a fuel filter.

825
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:39.840
I did that a couple of times successfully and one time I actually at least

826
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:44.841
snapped it off and I had to have my truck towed down to,

827
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:49.260
uh,
to the fucking garage.

828
00:53:49.261 --> 00:53:54.261
And I told the guy I snapped it off and I left the fuel filter on the seat.

829
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.420
Evidently he didn't listen to me and one of his guys got in the car,

830
00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:58.530
started the truck up,

831
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.680
gas when all over the engine and my truck burned to the ground.

832
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:06.510
And then the guy tried to call me up and gorilla his way through it,
you know,

833
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:10.890
go and what the fuck you told me you twisted it.

834
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:16.080
We just had a fire.
That's what he kept saying.
We just had a fire.
And I was like,

835
00:54:16.081 --> 00:54:21.030
no dude,
you just had a fire.
Okay.
I told you I twist.

836
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.450
You said you snack.
Yeah.
You said you twisted.
I said,
no.
I said,
I snapped it.

837
00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:28.230
Off I go,
I left the fucking fuel filter right on the Goddamn seat.

838
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.460
He goes,
you know what?
I'm so fucking sick.
You guys,
you know,

839
00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:36.000
you start the jobs and you fuck it up and then you bring it down to me.

840
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:41.250
Yeah,
my truck is broken.
Fix it.
You fucking cunt.

841
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.600
You're a mechanic.
What it be?
Other people bring cars in that a totally fixed.

842
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.140
Ah,
that's a whole nother fucking story.
Um,
and now you're probably saying,

843
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:54.120
well look it,
look it,
you drove a truck,

844
00:54:54.121 --> 00:54:59.100
that means you're blue collar now it doesn't,
it does it.
I just,
you know,

845
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:02.160
it was a car.
There was a truck and I,
I,
you know,

846
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:05.280
I could afford it and I was 17 so I bought it.

847
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:08.940
And I also had this idea that I was going to deliver papers in the morning and

848
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:11.070
make some more money,
you know,

849
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:15.270
and then I'd also have my afternoon job cause that's what I was into.
And uh,

850
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:17.700
when I told people at school that that's what I was going to do,

851
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:22.380
they were all like to force,
you're going to be a paper boy.
What are you a fag?

852
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:27.860
And then I immediately ditch that idea cause I had no confidence in myself.

853
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.230
And then I had some stupid truck that I didn't use,

854
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:36.960
but that's a whole nother story.
Um,
and getting back to me,
uh,
in the suit,

855
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:42.120
um,
shiny suit,
uh,
in real life.
It's not shiny.

856
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.700
I can't help HD television.

857
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:49.140
Hd Television makes everything look way more fucking vivid,

858
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.340
you know,
like colors.
I mean,
come on.
You know,

859
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:58.500
when you go to a baseball game,
can you see the pores of the players?

860
00:55:58.501 --> 00:56:03.120
I mean it's fucking,
it's too weird man.
I'm actually not a fan of HDTV.

861
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.920
I wish they had the big screen TVs and they just went back to regular TV cause

862
00:56:07.921 --> 00:56:12.420
uh,
I'm not really a fan of that.
And as far as your in New York City,

863
00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:17.250
Los Angeles,
your big finger on the pulse of fashion,
that was actually,

864
00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:21.510
I bought it at Barney's in New York.
In La.
I get,

865
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:25.180
what do they not have the suits that they in New York.
And it was also,

866
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:28.390
I believe it was a Gucci suit,
which has made in Italy.

867
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:32.230
So that has nothing to do with Los Angeles and a,

868
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.220
I'm not street and I'm not every man.
Okay.

869
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:41.050
You know,
you sound like a casting director.
Yeah.

870
00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:42.280
So I just wrote back to her,

871
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:47.550
you are out of your mind because I wasn't really going to waste the fucking time

872
00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:52.600
of,
uh,
you know,
I dunno,

873
00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:55.950
trying to fucking explain all that,
but you know,
that's what happens people,

874
00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.800
that's what happens when you,
uh,
that's the internet.

875
00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:03.720
You know what the fuck was,
I don't give a shit.
You could fucking literally,

876
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:08.190
I dunno,
cure a disease and there would still be somebody going,

877
00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:11.430
what the fuck were you thinking?
You know,

878
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:16.230
Karen Cancer,
do you realize what that's going to do?

879
00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:21.410
The world's already overpopulated and what the fuck was with those shiny scrubs?

880
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:28.220
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
who gives a fuck?
Who gives a fuck?
I got to do the tonight show.</v>

881
00:57:28.221 --> 00:57:32.720
Actually.
I actually,
when that email came out,
I got it,
uh,

882
00:57:32.721 --> 00:57:37.130
probably about maybe three hours after I did the tonight show.

883
00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:42.320
And it's really funny living on the West Coast because I'm obviously,

884
00:57:42.321 --> 00:57:45.680
I'm used to living on the east coast and when you're,
you're on the east coast,

885
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:48.440
you taped the show,
um,

886
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:52.280
just before 6:00 PM is when you go on.
They take from five to six,

887
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.350
so he got five hours before anybody sees it.
But,
um,

888
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:59.810
you know,
and then people out in La,
you know,

889
00:57:59.811 --> 00:58:02.180
it's eight hours and then you tape it out in La.

890
00:58:02.181 --> 00:58:04.520
It's like you do it and literally three hours later,

891
00:58:04.521 --> 00:58:09.260
people that are out sending you emails about it.
So I had just,
you know,

892
00:58:09.261 --> 00:58:12.800
I went out and I had a steak dinner and all that stuff,
had a great fucking time,

893
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.150
felt like 1 million bucks.
And I was sitting there and,
uh,
when I got the email,

894
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:21.170
um,
I actually,
I read it to my girlfriend and we got to,

895
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:24.590
we both had a really big laugh when we were reading it,
just,

896
00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.750
just how long it was and,
uh,
and her description of me,

897
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:33.590
um,
I don't know.
Jesus

898
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:38.310
<v 7>price make me talking about this as almost as long as the fucking email.
Um,
yeah.</v>

899
00:58:38.311 --> 00:58:41.190
So they go with that email.
You actually learned some shit about me.

900
00:58:41.191 --> 00:58:43.350
I happened to love suits.
I love wearing them

901
00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.690
<v 1>and um,
but not shitty suits,</v>

902
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:52.180
<v 7>you know,
I,
I really don't like wearing shitty suits.
And to be honest with you,</v>

903
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:55.000
anytime I do a late night talk show,

904
00:58:55.001 --> 00:58:59.770
I always go out and I buy a brand new suit and I always go to Barney's and I

905
00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:04.630
usually spend three times what I'm making on whatever the talk show is.

906
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:09.220
And the talk show you get paid scale,
which is a,

907
00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:14.990
<v 1>I dunno,
what the fuck is it?
Like 900 bucks.
So,
you know,</v>

908
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:18.360
<v 7>I don't know if that lady who wrote it,
if you're listening,</v>

909
00:59:18.361 --> 00:59:20.370
if you wonder why I wear a suit,
uh,

910
00:59:20.371 --> 00:59:24.620
it's the host of the show is wearing a suit.
You know what I'm saying?

911
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:25.850
You dress for the room.

912
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:29.570
I'm not going to come out there and look like somebody they just pulled out of

913
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:33.290
the crowd.
You know,
it's funny,
I really have to explain this every fucking time.

914
00:59:33.291 --> 00:59:37.430
I do.
I do the,
uh,
I do one of these late night talk shows.

915
00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:40.670
I don't understand why people,
you know,

916
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:43.670
don't just notice when the actress come out,
they're all wearing suits.

917
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:47.120
They're all dressed up.
They wear a jacket,
you dress nice.
Women come out,

918
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:51.350
you know,
dressed to the nines.
You know,

919
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.070
I guess people who are characters and maybe whores.

920
00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:59.300
Didn't Madonna come out with like no panties on one time or some was that will

921
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:03.950
Ferrell or he just came out wearing leather pants?
I can't fucking remember.

922
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.850
I don't know.
I mean,
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.

923
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:12.080
I love the suit and I love the shirt.
And,
uh,
you know,

924
01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.740
I got quite a collection now.
I think I've got like five or six of them.

925
01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:21.320
Got a couple of navy blues.
I've got a nice brown one.
I got one other one.

926
01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:23.240
I don't know what the fuck color it is.
And I said,
you know what,

927
01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:26.420
I'm going to go with a nice charcoal gray this time,
you know,

928
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:30.950
and then get a shirt underneath to make it pop bang,
Zoom,
you know?

929
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:34.790
But evidently it was unbelievably,
unbelievably distracting.

930
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.920
Um,
Jesus Christ believing in item 22 minutes into this fucking podcast.

931
01:00:39.921 --> 01:00:41.510
I was really worried that,
uh,

932
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.070
I wasn't gonna have enough shit this week because I'm,

933
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.430
I can't get on the Internet here in my hotel room.
Um,

934
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.991
all right,

935
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:55.010
so what can I talk about here to fucking flush this out and give you a nice half

936
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:58.160
hour?
I've got to give you at least a half hour here.
Uh,
yeah.

937
01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:01.970
So I'm in New York and I'm going to be doing,
um,
my next,
uh,

938
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.900
I think I got five or six more days shooting on this film and I'm,

939
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:12.950
I'm having the time of my life and,
uh,

940
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.070
even though I'm only shooting six days and I'm out here for a month,

941
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:21.110
I am going to go be going down to the set watching the other actors trying to

942
01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:25.860
learn that whole side of a,
of this business because,
uh,

943
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.920
I've,
I've honestly,
I don't know,

944
01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:31.400
I've never done a big movie before and it's pretty,
uh,

945
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:36.260
it's pretty,
it's pretty amazing.
It's pretty amazing.
So I'm trying to figure out,

946
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.850
um,
you know,

947
01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.450
just go down there and watch the actors that know what the hell they're doing,

948
01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:45.950
how they do different takes and they do all that type of stuff.
And uh,

949
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.370
I dunno,
it's pretty a pretty awesome time in my life.

950
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:51.380
That's the exact reason why I moved out to La.

951
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:56.210
I wanted to start getting bit parts in movies and um,

952
01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.040
you know,
yeah.
And just keep doing standup and uh,

953
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.360
that's what the fuck I'm doing.
And uh,
I dunno.

954
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.300
I Dunno what the fuck to tell you.
It's my birthday,

955
01:02:08.301 --> 01:02:11.060
so I don't know what I'm going to do.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

956
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.260
I got a fucking workout.

957
01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:16.010
I had the worst God damn pizza last night here in New York.

958
01:02:16.011 --> 01:02:18.200
I couldn't believe it.
I've had better pizza in La.

959
01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:23.490
I ordered for one of those famous Ray's pizza places,
which,
you know,

960
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.331
aren't the best.

961
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:26.910
I know I'm going to get a ton of emails going through or what are you out of

962
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:30.180
your fucking mind?
Famous,
raised folk and socks or with the,

963
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:35.720
you got to go down to fuck in a,
what the fuck is that place right off of,
uh,

964
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.000
sixth avenue down the village.
I know where that place is.

965
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:42.660
It literally Joe's pizza,
whatever the fuck it is.
Um,

966
01:02:42.661 --> 01:02:47.280
I'm actually a fan of satin pizza over on first avenue of just a couple of

967
01:02:47.281 --> 01:02:51.930
blocks north of,
uh,
danger fields.
I Dunno why I like it.

968
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:55.440
There's something about their sauce gives a nice little zing.
Oh.

969
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:57.940
And also I used to live up that way and,

970
01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:02.070
and that used to be my last spot of the night back in the day when I used to

971
01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:03.630
live in New York,
when,
uh,
they,

972
01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.240
I guess nowadays they're booking the club's a month at a time.

973
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.460
But back in the day,
you know,

974
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:12.480
when I moved to New York and a 1995 children,

975
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.123
um,

976
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.460
and they didn't have hybrid cars and they couldn't listen to your phone calls.

977
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:23.070
Um,
it was unbelievable to be a comedian,

978
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.610
to be a young,
young comic moving to New York City.
And,
um,

979
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.160
you basically on the weekend you could do anywhere from eight shows all the way

980
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:38.460
up to like maybe like 10 or 11.
Why don't you got up to 10?

981
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:39.690
It was pretty much pushing it.

982
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.460
And how you would do it is you would put your avails in with all the clubs

983
01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:47.190
around the city.
And I used to work the comic strip,

984
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:51.450
that was the first club I got into and there was the Boston comedy club,

985
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:54.900
the comedy cellar stand up New York.

986
01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.150
Um,

987
01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:02.180
and then later on was danger fields when I finally got into there.

988
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.100
And you just lead in each,
each club left,

989
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.660
you left your avails on different days so you could kind of set it up and you

990
01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:13.500
could just do a run all the way around the city and you just leave avails a,
hey,

991
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:17.850
this is bill burr.
I'm leaving my avails for this weekend.
Just to let you know,

992
01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:22.851
I got a nine 20 at the comic strip and I got an 1125 spot at stand up New York

993
01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:26.910
and then the seller would work around those spots.
Give you a couple more.

994
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:30.000
The Boston Comedy Club would give you a couple more and then you would just

995
01:04:30.001 --> 01:04:34.680
start your night and you know,
you're jumping in a cab,

996
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:39.090
you do your spot,
you'd run out,
you grab a cab,
then you go down town,

997
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.340
back uptown,
back downtown.

998
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.610
You know what the funny thing was is he ended up blowing half your fucking gig

999
01:04:44.611 --> 01:04:49.160
money on uh,
doing like a cab and all the comics.

1000
01:04:49.161 --> 01:04:53.520
You just be running around town doing spots and uh,
you know,

1001
01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:54.640
people sometimes it,

1002
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.720
your spots would be really close together and you'd call a buddy of yours.

1003
01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.240
Do what time's your next spot?
Can you do me a favor?

1004
01:05:00.241 --> 01:05:03.270
Can you do the 1125 and then I'll do your 1150 spot.

1005
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:07.140
Can you do that just cause I have a,
all right man.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll cover for you.

1006
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.800
And it was just fucking amazing.
It was fucking amazing.
And like,

1007
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.340
and then the end of the night you get 50 bucks a spot,

1008
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:18.490
cash and then the end of the night you just,

1009
01:05:18.491 --> 01:05:23.350
you'd have this big wad of cash in your pocket and you'd hang out with all your

1010
01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:24.490
other comedy friends,

1011
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:28.360
you've comedian friends and you get a slice of pizza and then you just sit,

1012
01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:31.270
stand around.
You know,
it'd probably be like two in the morning,

1013
01:05:31.271 --> 01:05:32.081
two 30 in the morning,

1014
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:36.640
you do your last spot and then you just stand around breaking balls until like

1015
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:40.990
four or five in the morning as the sun's coming up.
And uh,

1016
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:45.700
at that point I was actually living in an apartment with a Robert Kelly,

1017
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:50.680
hilarious comedian,
one of my great friends in this business.
And,
uh,
I remember,

1018
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:52.601
you know,

1019
01:05:52.601 --> 01:05:55.480
that was way back in the day and we become a home when the sun would be coming

1020
01:05:55.481 --> 01:06:00.220
up and every,
everybody we'd be getting ready to go off to work.
And uh,

1021
01:06:00.221 --> 01:06:04.810
you just felt like you were getting away with murder.
It was literally the,
uh,

1022
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:08.020
stand up comedy version of good fellas.

1023
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.950
It's the closest I ever felt like I was in Goodfellas was when I would come home

1024
01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:16.750
when the sun was coming up.
And uh,
you know,
that whole little uh,

1025
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.530
narration where,
uh,

1026
01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:24.130
whatever ray Liotta talks about fucking what it was like to be in the mob,

1027
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:28.990
how they didn't pay for Shit and all the regular people who went to work where a

1028
01:06:28.991 --> 01:06:29.830
bunch of saps,

1029
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:32.830
that's literally what you felt like you just saw everybody going to fucking work

1030
01:06:32.831 --> 01:06:34.820
and he's just like,
ah,
I'm not,

1031
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:39.430
I think I'm going to go fucking sleep till two in the afternoon,
get up,

1032
01:06:39.431 --> 01:06:44.350
play video games,
and then fucking do this all over again.
It was great.

1033
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:48.580
It was a fucking great time of my life and I swear to God,
I still,
uh,

1034
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:52.330
even with all the cool shit that I did this week,
I swear to God,

1035
01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:54.570
it's like that part of my career that's,

1036
01:06:54.571 --> 01:06:58.150
it's still on par with everything that happened this week.

1037
01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:03.680
I don't know.
Look at me.
I'm having a little touching podcast here.
A little fire.

1038
01:07:03.681 --> 01:07:08.680
Shit.
I'd like little fucking a mammary.
He's not a du Du du.

1039
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.000
I left out a lot of shit,

1040
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:13.090
like all the fucking psycho chicks I used to date and the chick who fucking

1041
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:16.870
stocked me and all that type of stuff.
That was a fucking,

1042
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.180
so it wasn't all good.
But you know what I mean?

1043
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.640
You tend to Romanticize the shit when you're younger.

1044
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:26.200
I'm actually sitting here right now looking at a picture of my dog,
Cleo,

1045
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:28.510
and I can't tell you how much I miss that fucking dog.

1046
01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:33.550
I absolutely love that dog.
It's ridiculous.

1047
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.180
Fucking dog was not even in my life like a month ago.

1048
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:40.330
And now like I'm already thinking about the,
you know,

1049
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:44.650
someday the dog's gonna die and how fucking awful I'm going to feel.

1050
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:50.110
But uh,
it's the greatest fucking dog on the planet.
It's just,

1051
01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:52.420
it's awesome.
It's awesome.

1052
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:56.050
And my girlfriend actually took it out over to a friend's house who also had a

1053
01:07:56.051 --> 01:07:59.530
dog and it's the first time it was off the leash and you know,

1054
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:01.870
it's still a puppy.
So like a year and a half.

1055
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.450
And I guess once it realized it was off the leash,

1056
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:06.520
it was running around like a maniac.

1057
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:11.521
Having the time of its life and I missed it and I was unbelievably depressed

1058
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.053
that I missed it.

1059
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:18.090
I literally felt like I missed my first born taking its first steps and uh,

1060
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.300
yeah,
I don't know what to tell you.
I fucking love that dog.

1061
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.860
And if you're thinking about getting a dog,

1062
01:08:24.861 --> 01:08:28.400
if there's any way you can do what you gotta do it,
it's the greatest thing ever.

1063
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.560
And go down to the pound and grab one dude,
they're free.
Fuck all this,

1064
01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:36.590
this rescuing shit.
I hate when people say that.
Rescued it.

1065
01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:39.320
Like you pulled that out of a fire.
You know,

1066
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:46.010
you got it for free.
All right.
You're not a hero.
You're a cheap fuck.
Um,

1067
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:51.770
now I know it's a great thing to do.
Um,
you know what you like,

1068
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.500
you like a Ann landers there in that show,

1069
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:59.240
that movie a dead man walking Susan Surandon.
That's her name.
You know,

1070
01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:01.700
that's what you like.
If you actually could have saved Sean Penn,

1071
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.250
that's what you're like.
Uh,
but anyways,

1072
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.680
I don't know what the fuck else to talk to tell you about.

1073
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:08.090
I told you a lot of personal stories,

1074
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:12.860
so I feel like I did my goddamn job this weekend.
Uh,
how about those Red Sox?

1075
01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:17.000
Ah,
AH,
here's where all the Yankee fans are.
Like,
ah,
you mother fucker.

1076
01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.450
You mother fucker.
I am a motherfucker.
All right.

1077
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:23.540
And we've beat new six games in a row.
How does that feel?

1078
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:27.980
How does that feel with your $400 million on three people?
Huh?

1079
01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.930
All Aja Burnett out there looking like he's in deliverance.
You know,

1080
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:36.170
he looked like he should have been sitting outside of fucking gas station in the

1081
01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:40.880
forties in the south.
Why does in his uniform fit?

1082
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:43.760
I want to send him a big long fucking email.

1083
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.840
I really appreciate you serving up all those meatballs to the Red Sox,

1084
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:50.810
but your uniform was so distracting.

1085
01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.440
You're from the Toronto Blue Jays,
euro hockey,

1086
01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:57.620
loving fucking pubic hair and mustache.
I Dunno.

1087
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:01.910
Um,
anyways,
they've got a buddy of mine,
a comedian,

1088
01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:04.430
he's a big time fucking Yankee Fan and uh,

1089
01:10:04.431 --> 01:10:07.640
he keeps trying to get all excited about this team and I'm just like,

1090
01:10:07.641 --> 01:10:09.300
I just keep breaking his balls going to,

1091
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:14.270
you guys spent $400 million on three fucking guys.
You should be in first place.

1092
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:18.800
There's no excitement when you spend that kind of fucking money,

1093
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:20.413
you know?

1094
01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:25.310
That's what I can't stand about Yankee fans is they actually have the nerve to

1095
01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:29.510
get excited about the team that they bought.
You know,

1096
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.810
it's obnoxious.
What you have is fucking obnoxious.
It's like,

1097
01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.340
it's like a bunch of ninth graders playing a bunch of third graders,
you know?

1098
01:10:37.341 --> 01:10:39.410
Hey,
do you see the fork in Yaggies?
Oh,

1099
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:43.880
they fuckin swept the royals over the,
yeah.

1100
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:48.800
It's been 90 times what the fucking royal spent.
You know,

1101
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:53.330
why don't you do it?
The Red Sox do.
You had a couple of big time free agents.

1102
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:56.570
Then you let your farm too.
Oh,
that's right.
You're not a good organization,

1103
01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:00.380
but you got a lot of money.
Look at you and yeah.

1104
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:04.820
Oh and six against the red sox.
You know,
that's got to hurt.
Hey,

1105
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:08.570
I saw somebody do a thing,
a this when I was in a,
this is,
there's a,

1106
01:11:08.571 --> 01:11:12.050
there's a sports guy here in New York that I really like.
Uh,

1107
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.040
he used to wear sweaters the time,
I don't know

1108
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:14.641
<v 1>what his name is.</v>

1109
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:18.450
He's got the white hair and he's got a really hardcore New York accent.

1110
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.580
He's on TV and,
uh,
I don't know.
He,
he,
you know,

1111
01:11:23.581 --> 01:11:26.460
talk about a regular guy.
He really seems like a sports bar,

1112
01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:29.190
like the Kinda guy who hangs out in a sports bar,
you know,

1113
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:32.220
and he'd sit around breaking balls in that type of shit,
but you know,

1114
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:36.450
he's on TV wearing a suit.
Why do you think that his sweetheart?
Maybe,

1115
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:40.890
cause he's on TV.
He wants to look presentable.
I forget the guy's name,

1116
01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:42.180
but I really liked him.
You know,

1117
01:11:42.181 --> 01:11:45.420
he's like the Yankees were up in Boston and they didn't do nothing.

1118
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.350
He literally talks like Dad,
he's fucking great.
But,
uh,
he was talking about,

1119
01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:51.300
you know,
what's the biggest rivalry in sports?

1120
01:11:51.301 --> 01:11:56.190
And people keep saying the Yankees,
red sox and uh,

1121
01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.830
I dunno,
I dunno if it is anymore.
You know,
it's weird.
It's weird.

1122
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.810
Somebody was trying to say,

1123
01:12:02.811 --> 01:12:07.080
and it ended in 2004 but you know what's funny was people used to say before

1124
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:08.310
2004 like,
dude,

1125
01:12:08.311 --> 01:12:12.330
this isn't even a rivalry arrival Rees when you got to evenly matched teams for

1126
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:16.440
the most part and they go back and forth and I can definitely tell you before

1127
01:12:16.441 --> 01:12:20.310
2004 we did not go back and forth.
We got our asses handed to us.

1128
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.290
So now it actually is a rivalry because we do go back and forth.

1129
01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:30.000
But the weird fucking thing is it was all about breaking the curse.

1130
01:12:30.001 --> 01:12:32.310
And now that we did it,
you know,
dad,

1131
01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:37.290
86 years of of shit talk and hanging over your head to be lifted.
I Dunno.
It's,

1132
01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:38.880
it's really not the same thing.

1133
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.340
I was talking to a buddy of mine about that last night on the phone and uh,

1134
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.280
I dunno,
I think the AF to see it on HBO.

1135
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.190
I saw this thing about the Ohio state Buckeye,

1136
01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:54.420
Michigan Wolverine rivalry and I challenge any Yankee,

1137
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:57.020
a red sox fan to watch that thing and to,

1138
01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:01.560
and you and to act as though fucking red sox Yankees is at that level.

1139
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:06.540
Cause I got news for you.
It isn't,
those people are fucking maniacs out there.

1140
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:11.640
I actually went to a Michigan,
Ohio state game.
How great is my fucking life to,

1141
01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:15.180
how was I doing?
I was doing some sort of road gig and I got some,

1142
01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.200
I got tickets to it.
This is back on.

1143
01:13:19.201 --> 01:13:21.990
The only guy that can really remember was playing was that wide receiver.

1144
01:13:21.991 --> 01:13:26.991
A Boston for a Ohio state was playing was the late nineties.

1145
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:31.050
And um,
I don't fucking know.

1146
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:34.530
All I know is I've never been to a sporting of 100,000,

1147
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:38.610
like 105,000 people showed up,

1148
01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.580
hundred and five fucking thousand people.

1149
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:46.410
And there was like another 30,000 people outside trying to buy tickets.
I,

1150
01:13:46.411 --> 01:13:47.244
you know,

1151
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:50.760
the only other thing I've seen bigger than that as the Indianapolis 500,

1152
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.210
which I don't know how many people that fucking holds,
but I mean

1153
01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.920
you're talking about cars going 200 miles an hour.

1154
01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.180
So in this people surrounding the entire thing,
um,

1155
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:04.530
I kind of lost track there.

1156
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.050
I don't know what the fuck I'm trying to say every tell you that time I went to

1157
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:11.410
fucking,
uh,
the Indianapolis 500.
It's a fucking great time.

1158
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:14.350
You can bring your own booze in there.
You bring it,
you get,

1159
01:14:14.351 --> 01:14:15.370
you get like this is what you do.

1160
01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:19.450
You just buy as much fucking beer as humanly possible.

1161
01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:22.390
Don't get hard stuff cause you're going to pass out by the fire halfway through

1162
01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:24.640
the race,
right?
And you're going to hit by some debris,

1163
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.780
but you bring a fucking cooler in there and it's all these fucking crazy redneck

1164
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:32.510
fans.
And uh,
you know,

1165
01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:35.810
the car's just go flying by.
He can't really see shit.

1166
01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.170
All you do is hope that somebody crashes in front of you.
And then when they do,

1167
01:14:39.171 --> 01:14:41.780
they hit the wall and then they just keep fucking going.

1168
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.050
It's not like they hit the wall and just stop,

1169
01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.020
<v 7>you know they hit the wall,
he's just,</v>

1170
01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:50.620
it's like a fucking cartoon and that's all you hear.

1171
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:53.260
You just stand there and you just hear him coming around the corner just here

1172
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.890
that she is usually either the first guy,
the last guy,

1173
01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.350
and then at their kind of bunched together.
You just here,

1174
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:16.280
it's pretty good,
right?

1175
01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.900
Cause I fucking hard if we're about four God damn hours getting shit faced and

1176
01:15:20.901 --> 01:15:24.290
there's nothing to do.
So what you do is you go in there and,
I dunno,

1177
01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:26.150
there's like 40 cars or something like that,

1178
01:15:26.151 --> 01:15:29.840
that race and everybody just starts gambling,
right?

1179
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:31.580
And if you're there with four other guys each,

1180
01:15:31.581 --> 01:15:36.530
he gets 10 fucking cars and everybody throws in 100 bucks and then you just

1181
01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:38.960
start looking for you guys,
right?

1182
01:15:38.961 --> 01:15:41.520
And all of a sudden they're going around and next time they come back around,

1183
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:47.290
you noticed one of your guys as a day like what the fuck happened to him?

1184
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:52.180
And then you're like,
ah,
God damn it,
he hit the wall.
Shit,
I'm down to nine guys.

1185
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:55.840
And actually it actually stays interesting.
I went two years in a row,

1186
01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:01.020
I went in [inaudible] 95 and in [inaudible] 96 and I definitely recommend it.

1187
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:05.020
I ain't know what the fuck I'm talking about here.
People I don't even know.

1188
01:16:05.021 --> 01:16:08.770
I don't have my fucking computers on because I'm in this hotel and I can't sign

1189
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:13.700
up for the Goddamn,
uh,
the Internet.
So,
um,
I dunno,

1190
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.960
I'm going to be in New York for a month and I'm going to be popping around the

1191
01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:20.920
clubs doing spots.
Um,
I haven't left avails yet,

1192
01:16:20.921 --> 01:16:25.600
but if you're in the New York City area and you want to watch me and a bunch of

1193
01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:28.110
other great comics,
I'll probably be going up down the seller,

1194
01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:31.150
maybe the comic strip,
Caroline's,

1195
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:35.070
we'll probably pop into a Gotham,

1196
01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:37.570
all these fucking places.
And,
uh,

1197
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:42.370
I'll be doing 10 minutes trying out some new shit and um,

1198
01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.480
I'll be in a great mood because,
uh,
that's what I always find this,

1199
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:50.020
this euphoria after you do one of those late night talk shows,

1200
01:16:50.021 --> 01:16:51.040
because you got to do it,

1201
01:16:51.041 --> 01:16:55.090
you got the rush of doing it and it went well and the pressure of doing it is

1202
01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:59.200
lifted and uh,
you know,

1203
01:16:59.201 --> 01:17:02.950
and then it's your birthday and you're like,
I'm going to go buy a fucking slice,

1204
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.300
a red velvet cake.
That's what I'm going to do.
You know,
I should,
I should,

1205
01:17:07.301 --> 01:17:10.280
I should do and stick a candle in it and just singing happy birthday

1206
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.660
<v 1>to myself and just see if anybody else in the restaurant either joins in or if</v>

1207
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:16.790
they just look at me like I'm a complete psycho.

1208
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.530
I wish I had the acting chops to start singing that to myself and then actually

1209
01:17:21.531 --> 01:17:24.230
breaking down crying.
I wonder if I would,
uh,

1210
01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.310
uh,
fuck.
Alright.
So that's it.

1211
01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:34.430
That's the Monday morning podcast I did here on Wednesday.
Sorry.

1212
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:37.580
It took me a couple of days,
but I had a big week and a,

1213
01:17:37.581 --> 01:17:41.480
sorry about the production value of a,
the podcast isn't going to be that good,

1214
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:46.670
uh,
over the next couple of weeks as I hang in here in New York,
and that's it.

1215
01:17:46.671 --> 01:17:50.930
I hope all you guys have a great week and a,
and that is it.

1216
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.570
And a happy birthday to me.

1217
01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:02.780
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

1218
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:23.910
okay.
Okay.

1219
01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:20.360
I wasn't number one on the here.

1220
01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:26.620
<v 9>Yeah.</v>
