1
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.640
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:06.220
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:10.180
July 31st,
2017 what's going on?
How are you?

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.410
What's going on?
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.990
How is she a summer?
Huh?
Is it going to be a heat wave?

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.920
The heat's coming back.
All my God.

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.250
Please try to stay in shy inside the air conditioning.

8
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:28.870
If you don't have air conditioning,

9
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:32.320
please try to remember to keep your windows open and stick your head through the

10
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:36.100
opening in the window,
not in the solid part of the wall.

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.920
You know when they do that shit on the news and they try to help old people not

12
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:45.030
die in the summer,
he what?
A fucking way to go.

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.620
You'll live almost a century and yes,
you know,
you've lived through the wars,

14
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.530
you've lived through the depression,
you've lived through a,

15
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:55.050
the fucking New York in the 70s and all that.

16
00:00:55.051 --> 00:01:00.050
What finally gets you a hot summer day and yeah,

17
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.070
just sitting there
and you just can't,

18
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.560
you just can't get to the window.
It's like when you'd watch wrestling,
right?

19
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.210
And it's one of those tag team wrestling matches and the guy just can't get to

20
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.130
his teammate to fucking slap his hand like Tagamet.

21
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.220
That's what it is.
And they dad said,
they lay there,

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.590
they find them face down in wrestling trunks.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.400
The greatest generation stormed the beaches of Normandy taken out by a fucking

24
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.850
heat wave.
Does it every year.
How many heroes?

25
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.270
How many years people are we going to put up with the sun?

26
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.770
Taken another one of our heroes away.
I swear to God.
You know,

27
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:44.960
maybe if there was a different administration,

28
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.590
they would handle the threat of the sun,
right.

29
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.660
My talking politics now,
is that what I'm doing?
Let's talk politics.

30
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.210
Why?
Why do we keep fucking with this Douche in Korea?

31
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.370
Why don't you just leave him alone?

32
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

33
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.660
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

34
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.270
It's like when you're on the subway and the crazy guy comes in the car,

35
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:10.490
you don't look at them.
You don't start talking to them.

36
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.240
Just fucking leave him alone.
Leave him alone.
It has nothing to,

37
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.190
why don't they just let the fucking guy,
you know,

38
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.780
run his country the way he wants to run his fucking country.

39
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.780
Send some food in their feed.
The fucking people.

40
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.500
Why does he have to have the same fucking ideas about strip malls that we do in

41
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:32.540
order for us,
for us to get along with them?
Huh?

42
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.210
Haven't we proven that?

43
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.170
It doesn't matter what kind of government you have in the end,

44
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.860
there's going to be human beings running it so they're going to selfishly fuck

45
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:47.420
the whole thing up anyways.
Who gives a shit?
If he's over there,

46
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:49.820
lighten off.
His fucking mad is let them do it.

47
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.870
The guy is clearly unbelievably insecure.

48
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.820
He clearly is,

49
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.080
is trying to follow in the footsteps of his dad's giant fucking shoes.

50
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.520
Although he's probably smaller.
I don't know how tall this guys are over there,

51
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.670
but whatever tall for over there.
Big Shoes for North Korea,

52
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.970
especially with all the lack of nutrition that's got to stunt the growth of your

53
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:16.720
fees there.
Right?
Why don't they just fuck it.
You know

54
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.360
we should like when he shoots something off,
we should just feed his ego.
Oh,

55
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.540
hey it go.
Where'd it go?
The Kim Jong Il this second.

56
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.340
Whenever you fucking name is.
Hey you fatty case.

57
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.850
That was a good one too.
That set you like that.
Look at,
look at ours.

58
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.050
It's awesome.
Fist bump.
Good man.
Good man.
Hey,

59
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.120
it's a uh,
here's a copy of that last year's Superbowl.
Check it out man.

60
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:48.600
It's fucking amazing.
What do you got?
You got Gangnam style DVD.

61
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:51.450
You want to trade with us?
Why can't we just try to get along with this guy?

62
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.710
What is the fucking problem
like?

63
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:58.170
We give a shit.
What the fuck he's doing to his people?

64
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.690
These kinds who run shit over here.

65
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:03.210
They don't give a fuck how many people are upside down in their own house.

66
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.100
They didn't give a fuck about the people in New Orleans.

67
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.170
They give a fuck about those people in North Korea.
Now.
They do not.
No,

68
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.070
they do not.

69
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.940
You know what it is that they're sitting on a bunch of material that you could

70
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:19.020
turn it to.
Those doctor does beats by Dre.
Goddamn it.
We want it.

71
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.050
So that's what we're going to do.
We're going to act like this.

72
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.500
Fucking God damned Fatso with his fucking three missiles is going to be a

73
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:26.334
problem.

74
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.263
<v 2>MMM.</v>

75
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.330
<v 1>Yeah.
And I want us to just leave the guy alone.
They're talking now,
right?</v>

76
00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:35.420
According to Google news that I didn't even read it.

77
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.010
All I did was just click on it.

78
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.270
It says US allies paired to use overwhelming force in North Korea.

79
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.650
General says,
uh,

80
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.740
we're prepared to shoot a bunch of missiles in his general area,

81
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.770
says the general hoping that one of them lands on him and we kill his few

82
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.240
innocent people as possible.

83
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.670
They would never say that the US in its allies are paired to use rapid and

84
00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:02.450
lethal,

85
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.220
rapid lethal and overwhelming force if necessary against North Korea.

86
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:11.030
The commander of the U S Pacific air forces worn Saturday night.

87
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.170
And why are we doing this?

88
00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:15.830
Cause this guy's shooting off his own fireworks cause he's testing missiles the

89
00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:20.831
way we do a North Korea remains the most urgent threat to regional stability.

90
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.560
O Shaughnessy said,
o Shaughnessy,
you've done it again.

91
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.000
<v 2>Yeah,
Jesus Christ.</v>

92
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.410
<v 1>Do we really got to go in there and blow this guy up with a bunch of other</v>

93
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:38.670
people just trying to fucking get to work.
It's gotta be another way to do it.

94
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.151
Don't,
don't,

95
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:43.380
don't we have any James Bond's guys that can just kind of go in there and start

96
00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:47.400
banging the hottest chicks chicks in North Korea is they subtly try to kill him,

97
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.810
you know?
But the power of his dick is so overwhelming.
They forget to kill him.

98
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:54.660
And then he realized that by the time they realize I was supposed to kill that

99
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:59.240
guy,
but I was so busy having orgasms.
Right.
He's already out the door.

100
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.590
He's got the pass codes,
and then he goes down there.
How would you kill that guy?

101
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:05.000
How would you kill that fat bastard?

102
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.340
<v 0>No.
Okay.</v>

103
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.230
<v 1>You know what I would do?
I give him a honey of a ham.
You know,</v>

104
00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:14.500
the glazed ones that they have around Christmas except in the glaze would be

105
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:17.770
some sort of Sinai.
That's where you hide the poison,
you know?

106
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.840
And he would just be staring at it and he would just,

107
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:24.700
mouth would be watering so much that he couldn't wait for the official taste

108
00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:27.490
tester to give it a try,
you know?

109
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.200
And he would literally die while making himself a sandwich.
You know,

110
00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:35.320
when you're so hungry you making the sandwich and you already fucking thrown

111
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.330
chunks of meat in your mouth.
That's when he would be doing,

112
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.810
so it'd be two prices.
What does,
does he look?
He looks like a white bread guy,

113
00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:43.510
doesn't he?
He's definitely not a multigrain,

114
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.593
<v 0>you know?</v>

115
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.590
<v 1>Do you think he gets an everything Bagel on the way to work every day?</v>

116
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.860
I hear a hairless bastard.
I bet he doesn't even have to wear deodorant.
You know,

117
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.740
there's a lot of things to like about him.
He's fat,
you know,

118
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:03.250
so he's non threatening,
you know,

119
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.890
that means he likes eat strikes to fucking stay up late and Netflix and chill.

120
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.480
You can see that about him,
you know.
Do you think he knows how to dance?

121
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.120
Have you noticed that about little people and uh,
in fat and fat people,

122
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.720
they transcend race when it comes to dancing,
you know,

123
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.900
it's like white guys can't dance pretty much general unless they have fat or

124
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:30.650
they're a little person,
then all of a sudden they're just fucking,

125
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:34.370
it's just like,
wow,
will you in the beat at video,
what's going on here?

126
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.000
It's because they had to,
that's what happens.

127
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:42.200
You have to visit certain amount of ice cream that you eat where the laws of

128
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:47.201
nature just take over and at some point you have to learn how to dance or you're

129
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:52.400
just going to be heading into an abyss of sadness that,
you know,

130
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.330
there's not enough chips Ahoy or in the world can fill that void.

131
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.100
Or is it that they get that sweat into the oldies Richard Simmons thing and that

132
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:05.670
just kind of launches this talent.
They didn't know this is just for fat people.

133
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:06.630
I don't know about little people.

134
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.803
<v 0>You know,</v>

135
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.370
<v 1>little people could sit down at the ground,
they can see the steps easier.</v>

136
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.100
You know where like when Michael Jackson First Moonwalk,
you know,

137
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.980
everybody was as tall as Michael Jackson,

138
00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:19.960
so we couldn't figure out what he was doing with his feet.

139
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:23.620
But little people down at the ground,
they lie,
I got that shit right.

140
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:27.370
And the next day you're in the subway.
Don't,
don't,
don't,
don't,

141
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.240
don't all bone bone.

142
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:34.241
When it was like fucking eight little people all coming at you and you,

143
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.940
did you ever see that?

144
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.650
Do you ever go into the subways of Brooklyn and there was a bunch of little

145
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:44.020
people doing recreating the bad video?

146
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.310
Know that Jack Golf [inaudible] I'm bad.

147
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.550
No.
What's going on?
I'm going to stupid mode.
I'm trying to say.

148
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.980
How would you North Korea.

149
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

150
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.830
<v 1>I have no idea.
You know,
it's funny.
He's like a baby.
He's like baby fat.</v>

151
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.110
That's what I like about that guy.
Like if you wore shorts,

152
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.990
it probably looked like,
uh oh cutie pies there.

153
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.030
Are you getting ready for a nap?
Woke up.
Oh,
you did?

154
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.860
You did.

155
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.660
You want to go to Brooklyn today and watch us eat real people food while you

156
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.830
keep drinking milk?

157
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.960
<v 2>Um,
all right.
Was that all right?</v>

158
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.880
<v 1>No,
I dunno.
I Dunno what I was talking.</v>

159
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:31.230
I was talking about some fucking stupid shit.
Um,
yeah.
So why,

160
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.123
why

161
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.840
like honestly what would happen if we just left that guy alone?

162
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.470
You know what would happen if you just,
I'm seriously asking this.

163
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:49.930
If you lifted all the sanctions and he was able to trade with the world and they

164
00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:53.200
were able to fucking get some food in there,
whatever the fuck's going on.

165
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:56.680
If you just honestly just let him do his shit.
I mean,

166
00:09:56.681 --> 00:10:01.500
we shoot off fucking missiles all the time.
We don't use oil.
Yeah.
We,

167
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.453
<v 2>no,</v>

168
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.790
<v 1>this is what kills me.
How do we even know what the fuck he's doing over there?</v>

169
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.950
Who is fucking time to be watching this shit?

170
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.340
Can you imagine if that was your Goddamn job and then you'd go on home on the

171
00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:26.540
subway and then you sit next to me and you're watching me losing my shit cause I

172
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:28.610
can't download the new operating system.

173
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.100
And you're sitting there dealing with the fact

174
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.400
that there's some chubby little fella on the other side of the world shooting us

175
00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:40.540
some shit that could possibly be on its way over here right now.

176
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.573
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

177
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.850
<v 1>Do you think if the animals had the abilities,</v>

178
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.190
they had the ability to shoot those missiles,

179
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.430
do you think they would do it in an effort to try to wipe all of us out so they

180
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:56.580
could just go back to fucking catching trout in a stream?

181
00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.070
You know,
if there was going to be an animal out there that would betray us,

182
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:05.240
which,
which species do you think there would be?
You know,

183
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.640
it have to be something,
at least at the level of a bear.

184
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.080
Reptiles are out reptiles of like,
you know,
Bill,
they're,

185
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.170
they're like,
you know,
there's those kids that go to the,
the,

186
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.590
the like reptiles have like learning disabilities,
right?

187
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.500
They have like fucking dyslexia.

188
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.380
A Dee Dee,
you know,

189
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.410
they like the riddle and kids of the animal kingdom or they even considered an

190
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:37.320
animal is a reptile and animal.
I always forget this shit.
Any Amphibian,

191
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.203
<v 2>right?</v>

192
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.380
<v 1>An Amphibian is something that can uh,
be,
uh,</v>

193
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.820
it's like aqua man,
right?
He's out of the ocean.

194
00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:51.520
He's talking to a dolphin and then later on that night,
you know,

195
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.330
he's getting Sushi.
I'd be fucked up,
right?

196
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.140
It's on a Daikin Sushi this date.
Sitting there looking at him like,
you know,

197
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:03.580
you just seem like you're somewhere else.

198
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.040
You just got like the weight of the world and he's sitting there going like,

199
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.490
I wonder if I'm eating somebody that helped me out one time.

200
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:13.783
<v 3>Remember that Shit.</v>

201
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.120
<v 1>For some reason they would all come and help them.</v>

202
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.460
They never really explained that.
Did they,
why they all liked him?

203
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.920
Why they would interrupt whatever the fuck it is that they were doing to stop

204
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:29.570
some other fucking people in a boat.

205
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.260
Is it bringing in a key of cocaine or some shit into the u s and it's just like,

206
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.960
like
a whale doesn't even know what cocaine is.

207
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.250
Why is it going to get hurt its tail smashing this boat?

208
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.820
Because as much as it could smash the boat,
this,
this pointy stuff,
right?

209
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:48.010
There's the master and all of that.
He could hurt himself

210
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.030
and all he gets is a thank you.
You know,
does aqua man go,
hey,

211
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.440
thanks a lot.
By the way,
there's a bunch of plankton over their little heads up.

212
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.920
No one's seen it yet.
Ah,
thank you.
Welcome.
And he never did it.
You just be like,

213
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:07.800
oh,
thank you.
How fucking insecure these God damn fish.

214
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:09.663
<v 0>MMM.</v>

215
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:16.520
<v 1>Here's another thing too.
I'm sick of fucking hot.
Newscasters,
male and female.</v>

216
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.940
All right.
What do you,
what are you trying to do here?
You know,

217
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.530
I don't need to be aroused when I'm fucking listening to world news.

218
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.610
Holy Shit.
What happened to that fucking Lady's face?
Oh,
it won't go down.

219
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.400
Come on and go down.
Scroll down.
Oh Man,
I,
I don't,

220
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:42.000
I don't get how to use computers.
There's something on the side.
Where is it?

221
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.140
Where is the lady?
All right.
And Arizona woman played dead.

222
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.470
All right,
wait a second.
Oh,
this is all this click bait stuff.

223
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.880
Kendall Jenner's nude photos,
sparks who gives a shit?

224
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.780
She really is the best looking one of all of them,
isn't she?

225
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.640
No offense to Kaitlin.
Um,
all right.
So I guess now we're going,

226
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:09.670
so we're going to,
we're having a war with Afghanistan.

227
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.060
We're having one with Iraq and now we're going to have one with North Korea.

228
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:14.820
You know,

229
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.340
this isn't this like when Ho home depot opened so many fucking locations,

230
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:20.320
they'd like started putting each other on a business.

231
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.223
<v 0>MMM.</v>

232
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.220
<v 1>All right.
Jesus Christ.</v>

233
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.540
We're going to do another one.
We're going to start another one.
I right.

234
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.730
What are you going to do?
Ag?
You know what the fuck I guess.
I mean,

235
00:14:35.731 --> 00:14:38.910
what do I know?
I'm just another asshole with the podcast.

236
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.700
Just trying to struggle through an hour.

237
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.423
<v 0>MMM.</v>

238
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.320
<v 1>You don't even really wish I've just wished like,
you know,</v>

239
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.880
why can't they just do it?
There's some guys shooting off his,

240
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.640
you know,
like it just go fucking do it.
Stop dragging me into it.

241
00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:00.190
Showing me what this guy can do and how his missiles can fucking,
you know,

242
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.280
he's a Roman candle.
Can fucking somehow land on my house.
So what,

243
00:15:03.281 --> 00:15:08.080
what does that do for me?
Micah supply what?

244
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.870
Up on top of my house.
Like a hurricane is coming.

245
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.110
It's Christ.
You were in the fucking Navy,
you've got,
that's your job.

246
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.020
Is it world news when I can't put together my new hour of stand up.

247
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.470
Oh,
shut up.
Go Fuck Yourself.
What do you want from me?
Um,

248
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.230
so anyways,
so my,
my daughter was,
uh,

249
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.000
grabbing onto this pleather couch that we have here.
All right.

250
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:42.770
Cause she's learning,
she's learning to crawl.
And uh,

251
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.440
it was funny,
she was like plank and today,
you know,
doing like,

252
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.380
not like what the kids did on the Internet.
We just laid face down,

253
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.270
face planting is what I thought it should be called.

254
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:54.320
She was like literally doing,
she was in upper push up position.
How about that?

255
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.660
The upper push up position.
Um,
and she was learning something and you know,

256
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:02.720
and I should've just let her figure shit out.
Instead I went,
there you go,

257
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.580
there you go.
And then she just dropped down to the floor,

258
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.120
looked up to me and smiled.
I was like,
it just distract her.
So anyways,

259
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.790
they got this pleather couch here and her fingernails are really long.
And,
uh,

260
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.250
and she was making that thinking nailed down the chalkboard sound and it was

261
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:20.270
driving me nuts.
So against
my gut,

262
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.920
I decided to cut her fingernails,
which I do.
Nia has told me to do what I said,

263
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:29.100
I don't want to do it.
If things are too small,
she wiggles him around at it.
It's,

264
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.110
I don't want to do it.

265
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:35.111
So I got the first four done correctly and then I did her thumb and she made

266
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.810
this face and started crying and I looked cause she was wiggling her finger and

267
00:16:38.811 --> 00:16:40.830
I thought it was underneath it.
And I,
I just,
uh,

268
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.890
just gave her the little s little little cut on a valve.

269
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:49.190
Got and now the families here,
I gotta go get some pizza.
I'll talk to you.

270
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:51.140
I am I really going to pause in this right now.

271
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.370
So I made like a little cut on a finger and,
uh,
it was,
uh,

272
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.520
I probably the worst feeling I've had as an adult

273
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.533
<v 4>and um,</v>

274
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.820
<v 1>you know,
when she was fine two seconds later,
but for the rest of the night,</v>

275
00:17:05.821 --> 00:17:06.750
every time she cried,

276
00:17:06.751 --> 00:17:09.780
I was convinced it was because of that little fucking scratch I put on a finger.

277
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:11.913
<v 4>MMM.</v>

278
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.010
<v 1>Worst fucking feeling ever.
And I don't know why I had to pass it onto you,</v>

279
00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:15.521
but you know what,

280
00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:19.360
if they could sit there and tell me that this little fucking fed shit over there

281
00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:21.340
was shooting off as a,
I guess that's what you do.

282
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.360
I'm going to let you know what's going,

283
00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:25.570
everything awful that's going on in the world and I'll let you know what's going

284
00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:30.370
on in my world.
That was awful.
And,
uh,
all right,
I got to get off the,
uh,

285
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.150
hang on a second.
Hang on one second.

286
00:17:33.151 --> 00:17:37.960
Let me see what's going on as far as people who are coming over.
Jesus,

287
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.050
I got too much family here to keep going.

288
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.380
I'll try to go for another few minutes here.
So,
uh,
yeah.
So that happened.

289
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.280
<v 4>And um,</v>

290
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.130
<v 1>just to immediately stop.</v>

291
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:52.230
So now she has like short fingernails at one hand and long ones on the other
end.

292
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.650
I'm trying to get my wife to clip the other ones.

293
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.850
She hasn't had the time and it's driving me nuts.

294
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

295
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.830
<v 1>Statically.
You know what I mean?
It's like the fact that like,</v>

296
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.850
the fact that five of our fingers,

297
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.970
I have short nails and the other five don't is driving me fucking crazy.

298
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.530
I don't know why.
It's the same thing.

299
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.070
You know when black guys walk around with their pants hanging off their ass like

300
00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:21.400
this,
that you just want to pull them up,
you know?

301
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.540
And then the white guy version of that is those white guys that walk around with

302
00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:27.730
this shoe's untied it fucking,

303
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:32.260
I don't know why it has no effect on my life.
I don't know what it is.

304
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:37.240
It drives me up the wall.
Pull up your pants.
I,

305
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.270
you fucking sneakers.
Okay.
Just can you be an adult?

306
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.453
<v 2>MMM.</v>

307
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.660
<v 1>Do you ever seen those guys that take it to the point?</v>

308
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:50.100
Literally they have a long shirt on that goes past their ass and then they have

309
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.260
a belt.
It's like,

310
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.660
I don't know how they can still walk.
I saw a guy one time,

311
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.180
his pants were literally below is junk.

312
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.020
<v 2>Um,
I dunno,</v>

313
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.630
<v 1>it's crazy.
Kids,
you know,
I guess they guys,</v>

314
00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.570
they have to keep taking it further than the generation before.

315
00:19:10.571 --> 00:19:13.870
I figured at some point that someone's got to be a rebel and go the other way

316
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.130
and you start yanking them up,
you know,
til you do the old man thing,

317
00:19:18.131 --> 00:19:22.120
what's right underneath your man boobs.
Um,
anyways,

318
00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.100
you don't want it became fascinated with since I got here because New York has

319
00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:29.890
changed so much with all these glass towers.
Um,

320
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.980
I got the tallest building in Manhattan.
This is new.

321
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.450
They used to be this place called the Drake hotel was Zeplin and all these guys

322
00:19:40.451 --> 00:19:42.390
stayed.
And uh,

323
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.270
this place that replaced it is four 32 park avenue

324
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.640
and you can have to see the fucking views of this place.

325
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.060
It's so,
it's so tall.

326
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:58.140
Like you can see the roundness of the world or the flatness,

327
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.700
you know,
depending on what you believe,
you can see the end of like,

328
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.940
you know those people that I think they think we kind of live in like a giant

329
00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:10.120
Coffee Cup.
Is that what it is?
You know?

330
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:15.610
I mean there has to be like even people who fucking don't think it's round,

331
00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:18.770
it's gotta be half round,
right?
Like you kind of tennis ball in half.

332
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.970
Then you just filled it all in with land and ocean.
Right.

333
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.620
But they think it's like that.

334
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.430
I don't know to this building on the top floor,
they have this,
this website.

335
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.690
I think on a clear day you could almost see the Tappan zee bridge.

336
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.880
You actually look over the freedom tower past the statue of Liberty,

337
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.770
pass that and island out to the ocean and the top floor.

338
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.740
I remember I already talked about
since podcast went for $95 million.

339
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.710
I think you get the top two floors or something like that.

340
00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:59.240
And then the floor below it,
the apartment below it,
second highest one,

341
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.360
there's still for sale at 85 million bucks.

342
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.440
And I think in the reason why that isn't selling is who the fuck is going to pay

343
00:21:06.441 --> 00:21:11.441
$85 million to still have some asshole walking on is it's sealants can get

344
00:21:12.741 --> 00:21:15.040
fucking keep it down up there.
You know

345
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.680
some rich guy walking around.

346
00:21:21.681 --> 00:21:24.470
I think you know they probably that I would think at that point

347
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.030
you could literally be wearing tap shoes and like it's so expensive.

348
00:21:29.031 --> 00:21:30.380
The person below you can't hear it.

349
00:21:30.381 --> 00:21:34.070
They gotta have some sort of soundproofing are spongy floors.

350
00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:36.800
I don't know what it is cause I know people who are that God damn bridge would

351
00:21:36.801 --> 00:21:39.590
not tolerate listening to somebody walk.

352
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.170
You probably have a herd of horses up to the person below it wouldn't have it.

353
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.900
So it's probably the reason it's not selling as they just can't handle it.

354
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.350
They can't handle view of that kind of money.

355
00:21:48.351 --> 00:21:50.450
You want to be the swinging dick in your building.

356
00:21:50.451 --> 00:21:53.510
There's somebody else above you drop it as jumped on your forehead every time

357
00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:57.990
you walk out the window out the door,
can't have that.
Um,

358
00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.100
what I did find interesting was that the,

359
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.550
the building was so tall that he actually had to call the FAA.

360
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.710
Um,
cause I learned last time I was out here,

361
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.640
I flew up to a Gig and a helicopter.
Right.

362
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.790
I just want to see fly with the George Washington bridge just to do it.

363
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:22.170
And he said
Bravo airspace,
which would be LaGuardia.

364
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.230
JFK in Newark was 900 feet and above.

365
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.900
And this building's like 1300 and change.

366
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.110
So it actually literally goes up into commercial airspace.

367
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.620
So at nighttime there's like these floors that are always lit,

368
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.870
just pretty cool.
And I don't know if that's because of the,
the FAA or what,

369
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.930
they usually just have like blinking red lights on the top or something like

370
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:47.620
that.
Like,
Hey,
don't hit this man.
Um,

371
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.770
anyways,
I don't know who,
who has,
who has that kind of money?

372
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.880
Who is that kind of money?
How long is that elevator ride?

373
00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.010
And also how long before somebody base jumps off the top of that thing

374
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.910
and if you did,
could you make it out to Ellis island?
Actually,

375
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:09.670
you know something as far as like jumping,
that's not that high up.

376
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.360
If you're going to try to fly right when those guys don't,
they usually jump off.

377
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.670
I'll time Ron Burgundy.
I wanted to shout it from my mom pack.

378
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.050
Don't they?
A don't take the jump off a mountain.

379
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:23.340
They go all the way down a mountain.
Right.
Jason Isbell,

380
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.930
you've really talked yourself into a corner here.
How would you,
yeah,
I have,

381
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.100
I have,

382
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.100
you know what I was going to do last week I was going to sing the praises of a

383
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:30.881
water taxi,

384
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:35.881
which I think I did a water taxi about how great it was underrated taking the

385
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:39.040
water taxi in New York from,

386
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:44.070
from Manhattan to Brooklyn or vice versa there Manhattan out to New Jersey.

387
00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:47.450
Whatever you want to do.
It's awesome,
right?
And no sooner.

388
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:52.010
And I took the local to where we made like 10 stops and it took an extra half an

389
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.740
hour,
but it was just relaxing.
And it was beautiful.

390
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.953
<v 2>MMM.</v>

391
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.600
<v 1>I made the mistake of saying how great it was in like three days after I said</v>

392
00:24:01.601 --> 00:24:02.890
that one of those yellow ones,

393
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.030
the guidance slowed down in time and he smashed into the dock and like 30 people

394
00:24:07.031 --> 00:24:08.820
got hurt.
Uh,

395
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.400
which means really probably 12 got hurt the other 18 and looking for a payday.

396
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.460
This guy just came cruising and he was probably texting.

397
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.580
I just don't understand how you screw up that bad

398
00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:27.830
<v 2>with the bowl.</v>

399
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.000
<v 1>There was the,
the,
the weather was fine.
It was a clear day.</v>

400
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.590
Like what did you do?

401
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:35.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

402
00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.450
<v 1>You just came cruising in that,</v>

403
00:24:37.451 --> 00:24:41.680
that there's probably the guys last run of the day,
the chickies been texted,

404
00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:44.860
he wanted a,
her,
she finally texted him back,
Hey,
what are you doing?

405
00:24:44.861 --> 00:24:49.810
I'm at a bar on peer,
whatever.
Yeah.
And he was like,
oh fuck,
it's going down.

406
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:54.160
Oh Shit.
Wait.
But goes flying,

407
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.260
you know,
and the boat I was on,
the guy driving it,

408
00:24:59.261 --> 00:25:03.820
he's just like surrounded by glass.
So it's not like,
you know,
airline pilots,

409
00:25:03.821 --> 00:25:04.001
you know,

410
00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:07.030
when they have a hard landing they just won't open the door and they just stay

411
00:25:07.031 --> 00:25:10.990
there,
you know,
so you can't seem,
cause then he'd go into the jet way.

412
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.740
When you're on a boat there's nowhere to hide.
You know,

413
00:25:14.741 --> 00:25:16.630
people just walk by and he'd just been loud.

414
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.100
Sorry about the js is a sorry about that.
Everybody laying on the ground.

415
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.940
Um,
I know I'm not supposed to laugh at stuff like that,

416
00:25:24.941 --> 00:25:29.020
but the end of the day I wasn't on the boat and no one I know got hurt.
So there,

417
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.870
there is something kind of hilarious about it unless somebody gets seriously

418
00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:35.920
injured,
you know,
he's just going to spark an internet controversy.

419
00:25:35.921 --> 00:25:40.210
Now is it going to brew be a group of six people that complain all at the exact

420
00:25:40.211 --> 00:25:41.620
same time and it gets picked up.

421
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.543
<v 2>You know,</v>

422
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.400
<v 1>we're going to go to war with North Korea,
but first podcasting,</v>

423
00:25:48.401 --> 00:25:52.370
can it go too far?
Um,
all right,
25.

424
00:25:52.371 --> 00:25:54.850
I'm trying to get up to 30 minutes here cause I don't have any of the

425
00:25:54.851 --> 00:25:58.340
advertising right now.
And I don't have any other questions either.
Um,

426
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.230
the New York Yankees are crushing it,
ladies and gentlemen,
they are a,

427
00:26:02.231 --> 00:26:07.231
they were down five games to the $200 million Boston red sox.

428
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.040
Uh,
my $200 million Boston Red Sox,
your $200 million red sox.

429
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.980
Okay.
Cause when teams start spending that kind of money,

430
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.520
like it's got to come from somewhere.
It can't just come from red sox fans.

431
00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:23.470
It even comes from people who are not red sox fans.
So anyways,
um,
they,

432
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:29.560
I dunno,
we,
we lost so many fucking games in a row.
We finally one last night,

433
00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:33.280
Saturday night,
I'm recording this Sunday and uh,

434
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.460
one nine to eight actually scored a bunch of runs for once,

435
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.860
but the Yankees at just surgeon,

436
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.280
but they're only up by half a game and there's like,
I dunno,
900 games left.

437
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.570
We'll see what happens.

438
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.230
But I'm more of watching the Yankees all week on the yes network here.

439
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.290
One of my favorite things to do,
watch them and root against them.

440
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:54.540
It's what I always did.
And when I get the baseball package,

441
00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.400
I'd lived in New York for so long.

442
00:26:56.401 --> 00:27:00.680
It's hard for me to turn on the red socks because I,

443
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.650
for so long,

444
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.180
my baseball watching was watching the yes network rooting against the Yankees.

445
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:11.700
It's bizarre.
Um,
and somewhere in there,

446
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:13.710
sweet Caroline came out and I don't know,

447
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:16.470
this is just a bunch of weird shit that happens at Fenway now.

448
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.910
I went away for too long and I came back and I just don't recognize it,

449
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.700
but I am back into it.
And,
um,

450
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.480
I really wish our team would just focus on trying to win and stop getting into

451
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:31.980
arguments with Dennis Eckersley.
All right.
He's a hall of Famer.

452
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.110
He's,
I love what he does.

453
00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:37.410
He's great at this job and I don't mind that he criticizes the fricking players

454
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:42.120
and uh,
Jesus Christ.
It's like all these stories that they,
you know,

455
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.650
people are here,
get the fuck outta here.

456
00:27:45.651 --> 00:27:47.900
Yelling at him and on like the team plane and everything.

457
00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:51.390
Like why would you do that to a hall of Famer?
You know what I mean?
If he,

458
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.620
if a hall of fame standup comedian criticized my act,

459
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.690
I would listen to him and be like,
all right,
well shit,

460
00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.930
evidently only I need to work on some stuff.
You know what I mean?

461
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.640
I certainly wouldn't start screaming at them on the team,

462
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:09.200
a comedian plane,
which is basically a commercial airliner.

463
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.920
Um,
all right,

464
00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.380
I'm going to take a break now because I got to go out with the family and uh,

465
00:28:15.381 --> 00:28:16.011
I'll come back,

466
00:28:16.011 --> 00:28:19.190
I'll read some advertising and some questions and we will wrap it up.

467
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.270
I have not watched the f one race yet cause I don't have the channel.

468
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:28.290
And like I mentioned earlier,
you know,

469
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.080
I dunno a lot of people that are into it,
none of my friends are,

470
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:35.730
so no one's really going to ruin it for me.
But if I had to guess,
I really,

471
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:37.380
I hope Lewis Hamilton didn't win again.

472
00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:40.800
I hope he's just not going to run away from this thing and it just becomes

473
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:45.680
Mercedes,
Mercedes,
Mercedes like it did last year.
Uh,
I hope federal one,

474
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.370
you know,
just to keep it,

475
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.930
keep it exciting before they go on the break or whatever.
All right.
That's it.

476
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.920
I'm done babbling.
I will,
uh,
well for you guys would be like two seconds.

477
00:28:55.921 --> 00:28:57.120
I'll be back in two seconds.
All right.

478
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:02.530
<v 6>A and I'm back.
I hope this isn't too loud.
Fucking the battery ran out.</v>

479
00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:03.364
And my other thing,

480
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.960
and this is me continuing on with the Monday morning podcast.

481
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.110
Oh lovely.
Mia,
how are you this morning?

482
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.390
I know you're not in a good mood.
She's not in a good mood.

483
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.860
You know every couple when you travel,

484
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.710
there's the one person that's freaking out that wasn't going to miss the plane.

485
00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:27.490
And then there's the other person who could like give a shit and he is the one

486
00:29:27.491 --> 00:29:31.390
that freaks out like,
oh my God,
did we leave enough time?

487
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.900
Did we bring extra batteries in case there's no flashlights on the planet?

488
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.380
Like I don't even,
I don't even know what airline were.

489
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.970
Delta,
are we in Delta?
I don't know.

490
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.180
I never fucking go.
You know what,
I on the way to the airport,

491
00:29:49.181 --> 00:29:50.920
when the driver goes,
you know,

492
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.690
I always know what airport I'm going to for the most part.
Uh,
the dude just goes,

493
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:59.590
what you're like and that's when I check my itinerary,
my itinerary.

494
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.620
I am going on virgin.

495
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.370
I am going on.
You Knighted.
Ooh Mommy baby.

496
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.890
All right.
So since I last talked to you,
which was yesterday,
uh,
the Yankees,

497
00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.170
the Yankees lose,

498
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:20.310
but so did the red sox were still a half a game though,
by the way.

499
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.540
New York sports press enough with the judge.
Shit.

500
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:28.830
Jesus Christ all rise.

501
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.210
Then they have this thing,
you know,
cause he's got the gap between his teeth.

502
00:30:33.211 --> 00:30:37.950
They like the tooth,
the whole tooth and nothing but the till we get it.

503
00:30:37.951 --> 00:30:42.740
His last name is judge Jesus fucking Christ.
Why is,

504
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.200
why do sports pages get away with puns?

505
00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.350
You know,

506
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:52.580
every fucking other day they got some stupid pun on the back of the sports page.

507
00:30:52.581 --> 00:30:55.780
Cause they can't write a fucking joke when they shouldn't be able to cause the

508
00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:59.630
sports writers,
she's just tell me who won the game.
Okay.

509
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.300
I don't need you to say,
Oh gee,

510
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.120
oh golly Jeter.
Like why is it always have to be a pun

511
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.080
sitting in there?
You're all a bunch of writers.

512
00:31:13.081 --> 00:31:15.300
You can't come up with anything better than that.
The tooth,

513
00:31:15.301 --> 00:31:17.910
the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth.

514
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>

515
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.040
<v 6>Oh,
just like fucking,
it just ruined my God damn day.</v>

516
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.410
I hate when I record just off my fucking computer.

517
00:31:24.411 --> 00:31:27.740
This fucking God damn air conditioning will not shut off.

518
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:33.000
<v 7>Just shut off already.
So fucking loud.
Awesome.</v>

519
00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.320
Awesome.
Yeah.
Why is it still on mode?

520
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.710
Hello?
Hi.
Fall low.

521
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.450
There's no fucking option here off.

522
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.890
<v 6>Sorry.
Just fucking this fucking God damn Americans.</v>

523
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.510
It either doesn't work or it's drowning out conversation.
You know what I mean?

524
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.590
It's like somebody you just hope it's going to pass out,

525
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.730
but that last 10 minutes before they do that,
just interrupt and everybody.

526
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.430
So this fucking air conditioning is like,
um.
Anyways,

527
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.100
let's get to some of the advertising here for this week.
Uh,
where the fuck is it?

528
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.870
Ah,
that's not it.
God Dang it.
Come on.
Come on.
We can do it.
Oh look.

529
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.160
Oh look who's here.
Oh,
would you look at this?
It's so zip

530
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.290
recruiter.
Are you hiring well?

531
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:38.790
Are you um,
do you know where to post your job to find the best?

532
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:44.840
Not the,
we'll settle for this person.
Not the person who you know.
Well,

533
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:48.770
at least he put deodorant under one arm pit.
We want the best one,

534
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:54.470
the smartest,
best looking,
most fuckable candidate.
Right?
Who's kidding?

535
00:32:54.471 --> 00:32:57.830
Who,
that's what you want.
You want people who know their job,

536
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.760
how to do it correctly and who look good.
That's what you want.
You know,

537
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.190
regardless of what these feminists might say,

538
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.600
regardless of what these fatties want to talk about,
at the end of the day,

539
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.570
you want a good looking fuckable reliable employee.

540
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:15.770

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.000
I love when he said,
you know,
I've,

606
00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:30.001
I've lived in a pretty confrontation confrontation free life and that is true

607
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.390
other than when he killed those two people.
I mean,
he was a hell of a Gotcha.

608
00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:41.660
Um,
all right,
here we go.

609
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.930
Let's,
um,
let's read some of the questions here for this week.
Uh,

610
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
microchipping says revelation 1317 is called mark of the beast.

611
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:57.710
Now,
sorry for this.
Click here.
This is going to be loud.
Block your ears.
Three,

612
00:37:57.711 --> 00:38:02.690
two,
one.
Click.
Uh,
what the fuck is it?
I know.

613
00:38:02.691 --> 00:38:06.020
I looked it up.
There we go.
Revelation.

614
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.350
This is the exact reason why I don't read the Bible.

615
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.540
A library.
Revelation three 17.

616
00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:18.650
Let's see if I can get this here.

617
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

618
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.500
<v 6>The temple of God was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple,</v>

619
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.300
the arc of his testament,

620
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.930
the arc of God's testament is the holy of holies.

621
00:38:29.931 --> 00:38:32.690
The second apartment of the sanctuary.

622
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.070
<v 8>I,
I,
you already me.
Okay.</v>

623
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.640
Evidently you can rent a room up his church in the,
you know,

624
00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.310
or he has one of the tenant,
uh,

625
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.590
in the ministry ministration of the early Tabernacle,

626
00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:51.591
which served unto the example in shadow of hip of heavenly things.

627
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.900
This apartment was opened only by the Great Day of Atonement for the cleansing

628
00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:57.890
of the sanctuary.

629
00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:58.850
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

630
00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:02.690
<v 8>Therefore,
the announcement that the temple of God was opened.
Okay.
Well,</v>

631
00:39:02.691 --> 00:39:06.990
there you go.
So I guess that explains my shipping.
Thank you Bible.

632
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:11.360
That really is the good book.
I mean,
I would,

633
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.480
I think I,

634
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:14.760
<v 0>okay.</v>

635
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.730
<v 8>I think I understand like computers more than I get the Bible.
I just,</v>

636
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.520
why can't they just write it in fucking today's English?

637
00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:24.990
They do that with every other book of lies.
No kidding.
All right.

638
00:39:24.991 --> 00:39:28.260
I work for the microchip company in Wisconsin.
Okay.

639
00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:33.190
Some stick fuck offered my boss a TV show.
Uh,

640
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:37.950

Just work for a company in Wisconsin quick the fucking job they want a lot.

645
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:57.570

Collect unemployment and not be microchipped come on,

646
00:39:57.571 --> 00:40:01.380

And please don't be dumb enough to think,

Good luck of somebody steals my identity dummy.

652
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.030
They're going to create a false credit report.

653
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.050
All they need is to Lee Harvey Oswald depended on which will be you and your

654
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:30.430
fingerprints.
Your fucking dope.

You know,

655
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.260
in the future there's going to be a knock on the door

656
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.341
<v 9>or,</v>

657
00:40:32.341 --> 00:40:36.700
and they're going to question why you killed a hooker and the Ukraine and you'd

658
00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:41.190
be like,
I've never been there in my life.
Oh yeah,

but uh,

659
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.740
but up,
up his,
this story of a person who didn't kill a hooker.

660
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.800
Now he's getting banged in the ass in the Ukraine

661
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:54.670
<v 8>cause he left his finger prints at the ballpark because he wanted a course.</v>

662
00:40:55.581 --> 00:40:56.600
Like,
all right,

663
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.810
I'm sorry.

664
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.130
<v 9>All right.
Vacuums gathering information.</v>

665
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.360
<v 8>Okay.</v>

666
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.200
<v 9>Uh,
hey,
big ball.</v>

667
00:41:09.201 --> 00:41:14.201
Billy thought you might enjoy this article in regards to your recent podcast on

668
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:15.820
companies and fingerprints.

669
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:21.030
Now it seems like those robotic vacuums are selling maps of the inside of your

670
00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:22.114
house.

671
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.820
<v 8>Okay.</v>

672
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.870
<v 9>So you can get furniture ads.
Yay.
Um,</v>

673
00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.080
massive Aussie fans can't wait to hopefully see,

674
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.550
see you when I go over to the u s in spring of 2018.

675
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.940
Yeah,
things are just changing.
So frigging rapidly.

676
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:41.270
You know what's really going to be interesting is when they microchip everybody,

677
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.350
okay,
they microchip everybody and then they put all the cash.

678
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:49.910
There's no longer any cash.

679
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:55.220
What's going to be interesting then is all these fucking,
you know,

680
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:57.530
drug dealers,
all these fucking,

681
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.300
I dunno anybody who just didn't trust banks and put a sack of money in the

682
00:42:03.301 --> 00:42:05.220
fucking wall.
What do you do with that now?

683
00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.293
<v 5>You know?</v>

684
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.670
<v 9>Now it's all on you now that's not even worth anything.</v>

685
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.850
You've got to show up with all this shit.
They'd be like,
hey man,

686
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:16.040
where did you get this money?
And you're gonna be like,
Hey man,

687
00:42:16.041 --> 00:42:18.860
I earned this money and I already paid taxes on it,
man.

688
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.490
And then going to be like,
hey man,
you got to prove that and like,
hey man,

689
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.710
I can't,
and then I'm going to be like,
hey man,
fuck your bag of cash.

690
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.230
What's going on?
Nino?

691
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.240
And you like my song above microchips due to due to a don't is this story.

692
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.930
Ah,
you just walking around,
you're getting ready and yeah,

693
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:41.330
you get so nervous on days what we fly,

694
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.280
Jesus.
Okay,
well that was fun.
Yeah.
So anyways,

695
00:42:51.281 --> 00:42:56.281
at least fucking lazy ass fat fucks by these computers that just,

696
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.720
these little robots,
that fact that sweep up after him,
you know,

697
00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:02.570
as they're written like Ritz crackers with like ice cream in the middle of it.

698
00:43:02.571 --> 00:43:04.010
Whatever fat people do,
right?

699
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:09.370
They're always creating some new foods on a holy matrimony of cock carbohydrates

700
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:11.120
and fucking sugars.

701
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:12.523
<v 5>MMM.</v>

702
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.730
<v 9>They're too fucking lazy to get off their ass and use a vacuum cleaner.</v>

703
00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.680
So they have this robot do it and then they map the inside of this person's

704
00:43:22.681 --> 00:43:27.270
house,
you know,
so they can do what with it?
I don't fucking know.

705
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:32.130
So they can sell them an l shaped couch.
In fact,
people sit on l shaped couches.

706
00:43:32.131 --> 00:43:35.280
Can they swing their leg up to that?
You know,
that other side of it?

707
00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.130
I don't know why I'm making part of the fatties today.

708
00:43:41.131 --> 00:43:45.360
Maybe because I started with that fucking guy over there and uh,

709
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.070
whatever his fucking name.
I don't even know the guy's name because it'll lead,

710
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:53.620
you know,
cause he's crazy.
I don't need to know about this guy.
Um,

711
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.630
we should get him to come over to the fucking Detroit Tigers ballpark and his

712
00:43:57.631 --> 00:43:58.464
fingerprints.

713
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.640
Then we'll put it on something that will go over there and we're a restaurant.

714
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:03.180
We'll stick them in Ojs old self.

715
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.983
<v 5>MMM.</v>

716
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:08.660
<v 9>How mad would he be?
You mentioned that guy ever went to jail,</v>

717
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.590
just standing there.

718
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:11.803
<v 5>You know</v>

719
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.230
<v 9>all that hair on top of his head,
but nowhere else on his body,
you know,</v>

720
00:44:17.231 --> 00:44:20.110
he's one of those weird hairless adults.
Right.
All right.

721
00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:23.320
Girlfriend broke up with me because I like your podcast.

722
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.030
Thanks me.
Thanks for helping me weed out the Kuntz mate.

723
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.070
Come back to SK sometime.
Saskatchewan.

724
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:33.990
I hope you enjoyed it.

725
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:36.330
There girlfriend broke up with me because I like your park.

726
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:38.930
I would like to heard more details on that one.

727
00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:41.733
<v 0>Okay.</v>

728
00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:45.140
<v 9>What was it that she didn't like about the podcast?
My annoying voice.</v>

729
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:49.310
My tone deaf sagging.
My inability to read out loud.

730
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.560
Um,
alright.

731
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.600
Addiction to on like prostitution to shit took should dear Trojan bill.

732
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.790
Over the course of the last year I've become addicted to online prostitution.

733
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:06.720
Juicy exchange is Christ too.
The courage you have,

734
00:45:06.721 --> 00:45:07.950
you just go online.

735
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:09.803
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

736
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.200
<v 9>She would just have her come over to your fucking place.
Like you're ordering it.</v>

737
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:14.200
God Damn Pizza.

738
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.130
What is it like when you look through their fucking hole and you see her walking

739
00:45:18.131 --> 00:45:20.290
down the fucking hallway,

740
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.030
the whole and your door or whatever you call that thing?
A little side thing.

741
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:27.920
She comes stumbling out of the elevator.
Um,

742
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.230
it started off as curiosity.

743
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:34.220
What would it be like to fuck a stranger for money and snowballed into me

744
00:45:34.221 --> 00:45:37.460
spending a percentage of almost every paycheck on hookers,

745
00:45:37.461 --> 00:45:42.461
anywhere from 60 to 3,300 try to stick with the $300 hooker.

746
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.540
You really get what you pay for.
Boop,
boop,
boop.
Here's the story

747
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.190
of a bunch of venereal diseases.
He said,

748
00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:58.520
I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago.
She had no idea,

749
00:45:58.521 --> 00:46:02.270
but I didn't want to drag her into this.
Well,
Jill,
you can't fucking do this.

750
00:46:02.271 --> 00:46:04.280
When you were in a relationship with somebody,

751
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.290
you said,
I recently got tested and I came up clean.

752
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.800
Thank God was what I was going to say,
and he wrote it to thank God.

753
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:18.900
No one knows what.
I Bet I do this and I'd prefer to keep it that way,

754
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.920
but I can't help myself from going on to those websites and meeting with these

755
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.370
upper,
these women.
I feel like it's getting worse every month.

756
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.470
It's already cost me my relationship.

757
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:33.270
It's costing me a fortune and I'm too embarrassed to ask anyone I know for help.

758
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.740
What should I do?

759
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.110
And I'm sorry if Nia is in the room and completely disgusted by this.

760
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:44.580
I'm pretty disgusted with myself too.
All right.

761
00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:47.590
This is what you have to do.
The second you wake up,
you got to rub one out.

762
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.920
All right?
And then you go to work and at lunch you go,
that was delicious.

763
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.220
Excuse me.
And you excuse yourself.
You go in and you rub one out at the,

764
00:46:57.221 --> 00:47:00.510
in the bathroom right now,
unless you can,
unless you can't lock the door.

765
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:06.590
And then when you come home,
rub one out again.
Okay.
And then that's it.

766
00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.970
And then you take your fucking phone and you throw it in the freezer.

767
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.520
If you have a landline,
you rip it out of the wall.
Um,
I actually,
if I was you,

768
00:47:16.521 --> 00:47:21.390
it's like this is like
if you spend spending this amount of money,
I would just,

769
00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:24.060
uh,
I would go to a therapist.

770
00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

771
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.070
<v 9>You know,
I'm just say,
yeah,
I'm addicted to online prostitution.</v>

772
00:47:28.071 --> 00:47:32.020
I mean therapist to hear everything.
Okay.

773
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.280
That's actually like,

774
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.640
that's like easy listening music to them compared to some of the shit they have

775
00:47:37.641 --> 00:47:37.930
to,
you know,

776
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.210
people come in there and talk about how they got molested by one of their

777
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:43.620
parents.
I mean,
it's crazy shit.
You're just like,
hey,
you know,

778
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.570
I like bang and hookers so it's costing me a lot of money and I'd like to stop

779
00:47:46.571 --> 00:47:51.250
and they'd be like,
oh my God,
you're sort of functional by all means.

780
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:53.980
Lay down on my couch and let's fucking talk about this.

781
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:58.450
Why do you feel you want to get prostitutes?

782
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.690
Why wouldn't you want to be with a real girl?
A regular woman?

783
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.620
Um,
all right.
I snooped through my husband's phone.

784
00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.860
Isn't that a song,
isn't it?

785
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.380
I snooped through my husband phone and I liked it,
isn't it?

786
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.370
That's fucking [inaudible].
Good morning Billy.
Good morning Billy.
Uh,

787
00:48:19.371 --> 00:48:24.371
on Sunday morning my husband had his work phone alarm set to 5:30 AM of course

788
00:48:25.691 --> 00:48:29.710
the only person at wakes up is me.
After I turned the alarm off,

789
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:31.390
I decided to go through his phone.

790
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.110
You fucking pores do we go through your shit is self.

791
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:40.300
There's such fucking horse.
I have to admit that it wasn't my proudest moment.

792
00:48:40.301 --> 00:48:43.370
All right then I forgive you.
You're a nice person.
Um,
see,

793
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.260
let me just jumped around.
But I am insecure while looking at his message,

794
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:51.550
I see that there are texts from a phone number without contact information and

795
00:48:51.551 --> 00:48:52.780
quickly figure it out.

796
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.710
It is his ex girlfriend's number and the text message.

797
00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:02.160
There's a lot of flirting as well as my husband complaining about my appearance.

798
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.450
Oh Jesus Christ.

799
00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:09.451
Well this is what you get for snooping and eventually asking her to get drinks

800
00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:14.410
together while we were visiting his family for father's day in their hometown.

801
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

802
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:17.570
<v 9>Oh Jesus.</v>

803
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:21.860
They were together for six years on and off through college and high school.

804
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.260
She cheated on him more than once.

805
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:26.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

806
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.560
<v 9>Um,
then when we got together,</v>

807
00:49:28.561 --> 00:49:33.561
she harassed me on Facebook and took an eight hour bus ride to try and meet me.

808
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.560
Oh yeah.
So this bitch is crazy and she's great in bed.
That's what's going on.

809
00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.770
I had to ignore all my initial reactions toward her.

810
00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.400
And just ended up ignoring her.
I didn't want her in my life.

811
00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.750
I confronted him about it and his only response was why would I go into his

812
00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:53.520
phone?
And then if I go looking for something,
I'm going to find it.

813
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:58.170
Jesus Christ.
When I asked him why he did it,
he just said he didn't know.

814
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:00.720
He has ignored me ever since.

815
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:05.850
I'm not sure where to go from here.
Thank you.
Uh,

816
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.760
you are amazing at colossal cluster fest.

817
00:50:08.761 --> 00:50:12.870
Too bad you didn't get to finish your set.
Hopefully you're in the bay area.

818
00:50:12.871 --> 00:50:14.550
It gets them all right.
You know something.

819
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:19.860
I apologize for calling you a whore 15 fucking times and all of womanhood,
doors.

820
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:21.960
Um,

821
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.130
well he's not leaving any doors open here.

822
00:50:26.131 --> 00:50:28.730
I guess what I do is

823
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.150
Nia.
Oh,

824
00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:39.190
she's too busy packing.
I Dunno.
What do you do here?
You're married.

825
00:50:39.191 --> 00:50:40.510
You obviously you have kids,

826
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:45.950
unless you were just visiting his father for father's Day.

827
00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.550
<v 5>MMM.</v>

828
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.640
<v 9>Well,
he's being a total bitch about it.
I can tell you that.</v>

829
00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.373
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

830
00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.493
<v 9>MMM.</v>

831
00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:04.090
I think you kind of need to have the what the fuck conversation like,
uh,

832
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.810
do you think if you'd just like,
ignore me,
this is going to go away.

833
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:11.820
Well,
hey,
you know,
what'd you snoop through my phone for?

834
00:51:11.821 --> 00:51:14.070
If you're looking for something,
you should find some.
Well,
yeah,

835
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.330
well I did and I did.
Would you say that to the cops?

836
00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.690
Hey,
we found a kilo of cocaine in the trunk of your car.
Well,

837
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.970
what the fuck are you going to the trunk of my car for him?

838
00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:26.220
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

839
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.070
<v 9>You fucking look into something.
You've got to find it.
The cops going to be like,</v>

840
00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.000
oh,
okay.

841
00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:31.773
<v 5>MMM.</v>

842
00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:36.730
<v 9>Fucking deserves to give you a fucking explanation.
A little better than that.</v>

843
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:39.040
And then you just sign if you want to work through it.

844
00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:44.050
And if he doesn't want to work through it,
fucking dump his ass.
This,
this,

845
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.080
this is the best you can do.
I mean,
come on,

846
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.570
you're better than this.
Anybody's better than this.

847
00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.373
<v 0>Okay.</v>

848
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.130
<v 5>Fuck this guy.
All right,</v>

849
00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:02.700
<v 9>fuck.
Is this kid a guy?
Get off pulling a move like that.
No response like that.</v>

850
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.220
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

851
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:09.110
<v 9>You know,
I don't,
I don't get that.
That's 100% not fair to you.
Fuck this guy.</v>

852
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.120
Okay.
And I'm not saying to leave the guide,

853
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.300
but if he's not going to discuss it with you,
then the fucking relationships.

854
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:19.100
All right.
The trust is gone.
Um,
all right,

855
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.620
good luck with that.
And I'm sorry you're going through that.
That's,

856
00:52:21.621 --> 00:52:24.110
that's really,
uh,
unbelievably painful.

857
00:52:24.111 --> 00:52:28.070
And that's one of the worst fucking responses ever.
Splash.
A little legendary.

858
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:32.990
I'm not going to lie to you.
I'm teaching guitar to a cute girl.
Oh,

859
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.810
Jesus.
Please tell me she's of age.
I don't like the sound of this are ready.

860
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.950
Right.
Hi Bill.
I've been listening to your podcast for a while now.

861
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.700
Just picturing this old guy applying Ben Gaze.
He listens to this and now,

862
00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:49.640
no.
Uh,
and I now know you lend,

863
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.850
you tend to give some solid romantic relationship advice.

864
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.510
So I was wondering a few,
it may be the lovely Nia too,
if she's around,

865
00:52:56.511 --> 00:53:01.100
could help me out with this.
Way about two years back,
I met this girl on my wet,

866
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:05.660
in my last year of university.
We had a lot of the same classes together,

867
00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:10.400
so we started talking.
We have a lot of the same interests.
She's really smart.

868
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.180
She's funny and Nice.
He just all around my type,

869
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:18.740
but it turns out she had a boyfriend so I backed off pretty quickly.

870
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:22.160
To this day we're friends and we try to meet up every couple of weeks.

871
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.950
Is just when Harry met Sally or is this actually your,
um,

872
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:27.360
so about two months ago,

873
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.800
<v 0>yeah.</v>

874
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:32.700
<v 9>She messaged me saying she always wanted to learn how to play guitar and that</v>

875
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:35.730
she finally bought one at this.
She wants,
she's into you do.

876
00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.010
I've been playing guitar for years,

877
00:53:39.011 --> 00:53:42.880
so I told her I'd be happy to meet up with her and show her some easy stuff to

878
00:53:42.881 --> 00:53:43.780
get us started.

879
00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:48.430
It slowly morphed into this thing where every week we meet up after work for a

880
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.490
couple hours.

881
00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:52.900
I teach ELL teacher courts and stuff and we'll talk about life in general

882
00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.510
anyway.
I noticed lately that a good chunk of the conversations,
right

883
00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:00.110
<v 8>about how she's been fighting with her boyfriend,</v>

884
00:54:00.111 --> 00:54:02.540
the same guy as when we first met.

885
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:07.170
Yet how many more fucking signals to your need?
Jesus crisis.

886
00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.110
You can not put Christmas lights around her fucking vagina there.
Um,

887
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:15.980
she's also keeps telling me how amazing on being for teaching her guitar.

888
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:17.690
And I'm such a great guy.

889
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.410
Plus the last few week if ever boyfriend calls and we're together,

890
00:54:21.411 --> 00:54:25.270
she's been sending it straight to voicemail.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
What,
what,

891
00:54:25.271 --> 00:54:26.120
what does she have to do?

892
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.650
Grab you by the back of your neck and fucking push your face towards her?
I mean,

893
00:54:30.651 --> 00:54:32.930
come on,
I'm starting as this guy goes,

894
00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:35.300
I'm starting to get the feeling she might be interested,

895
00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:41.630
call me crazy,
but this is where I need your advice.

896
00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:45.020
I tend to overthink things.
Uh,
yeah,

897
00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.860
I would say that because I tend to overthink things a lot in general and it

898
00:54:48.861 --> 00:54:52.790
actually had issues with anxiety slash depression in the past.

899
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:56.900
I was wondering if you and Nia could help me out here and I'm reading,

900
00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:01.960
am I reading too much into things or does it seem like she's actually showing

901
00:55:02.271 --> 00:55:06.650
some interest?
I'll take any help on what I should do here.

902
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:10.820
Congrats on your lovely daughter and getting the show picked up for season
three.

903
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:14.990
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Yes sir.
Jesus Christ.

904
00:55:14.991 --> 00:55:19.670
You're low self esteem jackass.
Yeah,
she's in to you.

905
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.800
So what do you mean what you should you do here?

906
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:26.490
Just I would tell her how you feel.

907
00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:28.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

908
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.280
<v 8>I would just say,
listen,
I hope I'm not out of line here.</v>

909
00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:33.560
I know you have a boyfriend.

910
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.983
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

911
00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.530
<v 8>I would.
I would just ask her.
I said,
so what's going on with your boyfriend?</v>

912
00:55:38.531 --> 00:55:39.580
You don't seem happy.
You know,

913
00:55:39.581 --> 00:55:42.720
you're always sending it to Tennessee and you're always fighting your sending it

914
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:47.070
to the voicemail.
You know,
you don't seem happy,
happy.

915
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.670
And this is a 40% chance there's,
she might cry

916
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.080
when she finally says No.

917
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:57.043
<v 0>MMM.</v>

918
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:02.790
<v 8>And just say,
listen,
I really liked you and I don't,</v>

919
00:56:02.791 --> 00:56:07.260
I don't like seeing you unhappy.
All right?
And not for nothing.

920
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:11.220
You have a broke up with that guy.
I'd love to take you out sometime.

921
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.350
Now would you like to learn how to do what?
Half court?
That's it.

922
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:22.230
How about that?
Fs?
Fuck me.
Yeah,
that's what I would do.

923
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:26.530
I just asked you about her relationship and she's going to say it's not going

924
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:29.590
well,
and then just say,
well,
you know,

925
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.760
just say what the fuck I just said it.
Put it in your own words.
Alright,

926
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.250
what am I seeing?
Or No de Bergerac over here?

927
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:41.310
Is that the right guy that the guy tell you the man hit back?

928
00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:47.520
I remember that.
What was it that was at Bronnie?
Did you feel booby?
All right.

929
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.800
I gotta go to the fucking airport and it's nine o'clock.

930
00:56:49.801 --> 00:56:53.070
We'll get picked up in 45 minutes and I haven't even packed you up or had my

931
00:56:53.071 --> 00:56:54.810
fucking breakfast sandwich there.

932
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.313
<v 5>MMM.</v>

933
00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.400
<v 8>Oh,
that's it.
That's it.
Yeah,
that is it.
Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

934
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:05.780
I will check in on you on Thursday and I'm going to go home today.

935
00:57:05.781 --> 00:57:08.600
I'm going to watch the Formula One race.
That's what the fuck come.
But no,

936
00:57:08.601 --> 00:57:10.820
I'm not.
I'm landing and I'm going strictly

937
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.050
<v 5>into the,

938
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:17.640

I gotta go back and start writing again.
Okay.
That's it.</v>

939
00:57:17.641 --> 00:57:19.260
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you
