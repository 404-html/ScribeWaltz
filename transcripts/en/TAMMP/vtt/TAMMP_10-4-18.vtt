00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.820
Hey,
what's going on is bill bar and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:08.940
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.380
just checking in on you.
How are you,

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.660
how was your week going?

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.650
What are you paying attention to when the news that's causing you to yell at

6
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:23.330
people you don't know online?
Huh?
What's going on?

7
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:25.100
Did you hear about this?

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.150
Somebody did this and then someone said that and the results may surprise you.

9
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.360
<v 1>All fucking day.
You know,</v>

11
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:38.900
I walked through the God Damn airport and I'm just looking at all these fucking

12
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.320
people looking on their phones and you know what I see,
I see me.

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.270
That's what I see.
I'm like,
I'm doing that.

14
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:47.420
I'm just sitting there staring at my fucking phone,

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.990
looking at somebody's flipping a fucking water bottle,

16
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.380
somebody fucking dunking a basketball and everybody running away like the world

17
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:01.400
just ended somebody fucking playing the drums.
What am I doing?

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.663
<v 0>You know,</v>

19
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.230
<v 1>I'd sit there and read a book,
you know,
so I look smart,</v>

20
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.980
but no one would even notice.
They're all fucking staring at their phones.

21
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:14.870
So what is the point of reading in public?

22
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
If other people can't even see you're doing it because that's why you're doing

23
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:19.490
it,
right?
Nobody reads in public.

24
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.970
<v 0>Okay,</v>

25
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.880
<v 1>you know what kind of a fuck.</v>

26
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.960
Give a see some fucking asshole walking down the street with a book.

27
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.950
You know,
you're just across the street like we get it.
You're smart.

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.033
<v 0>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.853
<v 2>MMM,</v>

30
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.120
well maybe you do read in public.
Maybe that's what you're supposed to do.

31
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.880
You read in public so you get credit for it.
So everybody,

32
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:45.780
it's like that time back on the Seinfeld episode with Jason Alexander wanted to

33
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:48.570
get credit for tipping.
They didn't seem so,
he reached back in to do it.

34
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.220
Then they thought he was stealing.

35
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.240
I think it's like the literary version of that or maybe it isn't or maybe it is.

36
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.230
Um,
anyways,
I have something to promote here.
Um,

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.010
all things comedy network.
I need you guys to get behind this.
You know,

38
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.920
if you feel like in a no pressure here.
All right.
Ted.

39
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:10.020
Alexandra has a new special out that you can,

40
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.040
you can actually stream it right now.
Um,

41
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.220
at a t c specials.com.

42
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.910
It's called a senior class of earth.

43
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.520
And Ted is just one of those guys,
man,
I sweat it.

44
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.800
He's just one of those comics that every comic loves and uh,

45
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.520
but you know,
you know,
this business is for awhile.

46
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.940
They like this person,
then they want this person.

47
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.030
And he just was never that person,
which I can relate to.

48
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.560
This industry was never looking for a bald,
redheaded mail,
you know?

49
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.830
<v 2>So I,
I had to carve out my own path.</v>

51
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.260
You like how making his special about me and my struggles.
You know why that is?

52
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:54.790
Because I'm on social media all the time and it's fucking frying my brain.
Um,

53
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.690
do you guys could go on and check out his special,
it would be a be great.

54
00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:00.040
You'd see a great,
there's

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.570
<v 3>actually this fucking killer clip of one of his jokes where he compares the fact</v>

56
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.530
that he's in his late forties and his girlfriend's in her early thirties and was

57
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.850
saying that,
um,
he was comparing his sex drive versus hers,

58
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:16.930
which is in the prime to when Shaq played on the Celtics where it was still

59
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:18.730
shack.
But it didn't look like Shaq anymore.

60
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.040
Took them like half the game to warm up all of that stuff.

61
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.060
It's such a fucking killer joke.
And uh,
when you watch it,

62
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:30.061
what I love about Ted is there's no wasted words.

63
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.230
And even like,

64
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.270
even like the physicality of his jokes propels you towards the punchline.
He's a,

65
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.930
he's an absolute master.
So,
uh,
please check that out.

66
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.990
And with that and with that,

67
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.280
that anybody watched the Monday night football game

68
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.940
but it don't put it on the Kansas City chiefs against the fucking Denver Broncos

69
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.960
and um,
Jesus Christ.

70
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.660
I thought that announcer was going to fucking faint.

71
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.000
I have never heard an announcer.
So God damn excited about a regular season game,

72
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.830
but that my home's,
he's like,
shove,
type my homes captain,

73
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:17.580
come back,
fuck gained something else.

74
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:20.970
My home did anything that he did like when he was rolling.

75
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:23.250
I'm not saying the guys and good,
he's not going to be a fucking star.

76
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:26.520
One of the guys said,
you know,
he came into the game as a legend.

77
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.860
He's been playing for a month.

78
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.153
<v 4>Right?</v>

79
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.320
<v 3>Everybody flipping the fuck out.
I know what it's a Goddamn business,
right?</v>

80
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.090
You know,
Brady's fucking older than dirt.
This other fucking guy is like,

81
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:42.100
you know,
uh,
drew Brees.

82
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.070
He's like a year or two younger than Brady Manning.

83
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.130
Fucking read Tom so old.

84
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:50.090
I can't even get through these fucking names without yelling.

85
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.830
A Peyton manning fucking retired.
They need new people.

86
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.493
All right?

87
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.870
How many yards of these new people going to throw for when you can't even like

88
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.490
start the hug them and then stop and do the,
you know,
you know the me too thing.

89
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.740
Now we go to hug a friend of yours and then you start to think,
oh little,

90
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.030
you get all fucking nervous.
You know,

91
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.500
that's the way defensive lineman grab quarterbacks now and they still get a

92
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.250
fleck.
So anyways,

93
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.760
the guy fucking rolls out.
He's a right handed quarterback.

94
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:21.160
He rolls out to his left,
this guys breathing down his neck.

95
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:25.330
He dives at his ankles and right before,
uh,
my home's goes down,

96
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.440
he switched the ball to his left hand and threw it like four yards in.

97
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:33.370
This guy caught it,
which I,
I've saw Brett Farve do that.
I've seen Eli.

98
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.350
I've seen people do that before on this guys that gone.

99
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.980
I hope you realize what you just saw it here.

100
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.270
I think the NFL game cause like,
listen man,
you got to hype this fucking kid up.

101
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.170
Okay.
You're going to have to hype this fucking kid up.
And as always,
you know,

102
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.740
I'm,
I'm the fucking Grinch.
A sports don't ever listen to me.

103
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:56.530
I'm always telling everybody to fucking relax and not be excited.

104
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.890
I'm taken all the fun out of it.
But Kansas City,
as of right now,

105
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.580
he has the worst defense in all of football and everybody's freaking the fuck

106
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:07.454
out.

107
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.760
I mean they should be freaking out cause my homes is looking like the real deal,

108
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.570
but it's just like you're not,
if you don't,
if you don't fix that problem,

109
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:16.220
you're not going to do shit in January.

110
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.880
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.940
<v 3>So I dunno what all this screaming and yelling at him is about.</v>

112
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.180
<v 3>I hope you guys realize what pot,
what I just said here on this podcast.</v>

114
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

115
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.361
<v 3>People going to,</v>

116
00:06:30.361 --> 00:06:33.200
that was like one of the greatest Monday night football games of all.

117
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.080
It's like was it seems like what happens every time I sit down to watch a game,

118
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:40.650
somebody is up by 10 and then goes into a fucking shit.
I Dunno what,

119
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:44.970
and then they lose the game when I was a kid.
Like that didn't happen.

120
00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.620
Like it happens all the fucking time.

121
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.610
One of the greatest modern I Bob codes of all time.

122
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.500
Hey Ron made me have three regular season games I saw the day before.
You know,

Like that wasn't,

124
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.280

I Dunno.

125

146
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.750
I go back to,
uh,
you know,

147
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:22.700
I start acting like I'm 22 years old way I'm eating,

148
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.500
which somehow back in the day,
you know,

149
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.580
you'd go out and drink a 12 pack and then hit Mcdonald's at the end of the night

150
00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:33.610
and go home and the next morning just wake up and go unload trucks.

151
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.770
You stomach was flat,
you know,
you just shook it off back then.
You know,

152
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.740
it's like doing your first burnout in a brand new car,
like the car getting,

153
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.820
you know,
probably wished you didn't do it.
Probably not happy it did it,

154
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:47.770
but it can shake it off.
It's still looks new,
you know,

155
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.050
now I tried to do that shit.
There's like fucking parts left on the road.

156
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.683
Um,

157
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.923
<v 2>anyways,</v>

158
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.230
so it's so Ba October and I wasn't going to do it,

159
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:07.590
but now I'm going to do it.
Oh well fuck it,
do it.

160
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.230
You know,
I'm a binge drinker.
I got to stop with the Shit,
you know,

161
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.880
I'll do it.
So now I'm on the wagon alum date,
but the potato potato to,

162
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.950
you know what's funny is people,

163
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:24.480
there's like two different ways of saying you're on the wagon.
There's like,
um,

164
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.530
you know,
like uh,
you're on the party wagon or your,
your,
your,

165
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.520
the way I said,
if I'm on the wagon,
that always meant like you're not on,

166
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.510
you're not party.
He fell off the wagon,
meant you started partying again.

167
00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:45.340
But then other people call the wagon,
the party wagon.
So I dunno,

168
00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:46.900
it's just one of those things,
you know,

169
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.720
it's kind of like that word cock with white people.
It meant Dick and with,

170
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:56.200
with black older black people,
I should say it meant pussy,
you know,

171
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.410
just a complete inverse.
I mean,
it's sort of an extreme example,
but

172
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.890
I remember saying that in the writer's room

173
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.600
and an f is for family and they were like,
that's not true,
is it?

174
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:13.590
And then they end up having this fucking snoop Dogg song from the early nineties

175
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.700
where your first to a woman's pussy as his cock.

176
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.090
So fucking weird.
Oh,
people,
people have different ways of saying thanks,

177
00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:27.450
don't they?
That was sort of my Mr. Rogers moment of the podcast.

178
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.520
I know there's a bunch of people right now fucking Google in that.

179
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:36.000
Go ahead and Google it.
Go ahead and go.
You know what?
I'll fucking Google it.

180
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:37.860
I'll,
I'll read.
I'll read it to you right now.
This could be,

181
00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:41.910
so maybe this could be something interesting.
Um,
by the way,

182
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:44.400
have you guys been following anybody?
Like I told you,
have you follow it?

183
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:46.980
Been following anybody for sarcastically on Twitter,

184
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.930
watching them make all of these news events about themselves,
you know,

185
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:55.680
telling you how difficult it is to be beautiful,
you know?
All right,

186
00:10:55.681 --> 00:11:00.270
let me see here.
Cock.
Oh Jesus Christ would fucking,

187
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.980
this is going to be on my search engine.

188
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.140
<v 2>Alright.
Cock a doodle.
Cockroach.
Cox Spirer cockroaches.</v>

190
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.850
Cockapoo alright.
Cock meaning

191
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.940
pussy.
Thank you.
I'm 50 years old.
I just searched that.
All right,

192
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:20.870
let's see what happens.

193
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.680
We'll the FBI show up at my door and we're waiting and we're waiting because

194
00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:31.580
bill has the worst Internet service and there we go.
Uh,

195
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.870
cock means vagina.
Let us explain.
La Weekly wrote an article about this.

196
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.100
Uh
Oh,
let me see here.

197
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.040
Okay.
Oh,
this is the one coc meeting vagina.

198
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:47.380
Let us explained now I don't want us fucking subscribe to the La Weekly.

199
00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:50.810
K Rodney Carmichael's early high school years were awkward.
Like many young men,

200
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.490
he wasn't sure how to talk to girls.

201
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.380
This was of a problem for a stepbrother who gives a shit.

202
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.780
Okay,
hold on.
All right.
He never met a girl in person,

203
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.190
but recalls that his step are the promise.
She was cute.
Even better.

204
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.270
She'd seen Carmichael from afar and thought the same thing about him.

205
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.190
So their phone calls slowly.

206
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:15.490
Miranda meandered from getting to know you phase too.

207
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.160
Clumsy Highschool attempts at flirtation.

208
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.890
Then she asked a question that stopped him in his tracks.
Do you eat cock?

209
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.470
Wait,
that's not a fucking clumsy flirtation.
That's fucking direct.

210
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.490
It's like a fucking military.
Do you eat cock for private?
Alright.

211
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.840
Carmichael was confused.

212
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:36.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

213
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.310
<v 2>Uh,
to the young black man.</v>

214
00:12:37.311 --> 00:12:41.630
Everything to that point had suggested a typical teenage heterosexual courtship.

215
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.460
But the question threw him for a loop.

216
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:44.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

217
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.090
<v 2>He's like,
I didn't know if she was talking about minor Hersey.
He remembers.</v>

218
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.330
It was kind of nerve wracking.
His confusion was understandable.

219
00:12:51.331 --> 00:12:53.940
He didn't use the word cock much himself,

220
00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:56.880
but he had heard it by white folks in the media,
Hbo,

221
00:12:56.881 --> 00:13:01.230
old playboy who was slang for penis when it was used by some of his famous rap

222
00:13:01.231 --> 00:13:04.200
FAPE,
favorite rappers.
However it meant something else entirely.

223
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.990
Take Miami rap act two live crew.

224
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.000
That group obsessed equally with bass and female anatomy,
uh,

225
00:13:12.001 --> 00:13:14.250
and most famously by most famous hit me.

226
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:19.251
So horny also had a song called HBC in which they chanted head,

227
00:13:19.351 --> 00:13:23.580
booty and cock.
Uh,
what you like fellows head,

228
00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:24.510
booty and cock.

229
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:25.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

230
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.660
<v 2>Oh Jesus Christ.
I don't remember that song.
And two live crew.</v>

231
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.540
Jesus Christ.
What?
Okay.
Snoop dog.
When I bust my Nep,
I'm raising up off the cock.

232
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.010
Snoop Dogg wraps his iconic 1993 hit gin and juice.

233
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

234
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.660
<v 2>MMM.</v>

235
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

236
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.070
<v 2>All right.
So we've got enough exam x examples.</v>

237
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.120
So no surprise that fledging quote,
courtship quickly wound down,

238
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.470
nobody's cock was ever eaten,

239
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:54.690
but comic definitely wasn't alone in this confusion.

240
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.530
There were surely many casualties.
And in an era when hip hop,

241
00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:03.360
sudden popularity forced this old bit of slang into a head on collision with the

242
00:14:03.361 --> 00:14:07.710
broader culture for one group of people cock referred to male Genitalia for the

243
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:12.540
other referred to female day or we go,
Huh.
And that's one to grow on.

244
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.930
See everybody,
you know,
every once in a while you'll learn something here

245
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.470
on the fucking Thursday afternoon podcast.
What do you think about that?
Huh?

246
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.570
All right.
So you got to be asking yourself,
the New England patriots,

247
00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:30.690
a play in the fucking Indianapolis Colts or rivalry,

248
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.770
arguably the biggest rivalry in the NFL during the Wella and Peyton manning was

249
00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:42.750
there.
Maybe,
you know,
I always thought the Steelers ravens was a good one.

250
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

251
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.550
<v 2>Yeah.
Who the fuck knows anyways,
it was,
it was a big rival,
but now,
you know,</v>

252
00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:51.620
it's a different time.
Andrew Luck,
you know,
took a year off getting healthy.

253
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.130
Now he's

254
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.750
<v 3>back.
Who knows what happens.
I love what the Patriots did on Sunday.
Oh,</v>

255
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:00.740
by the way,
I did I fucking call the fucking Broncos a what they covered.

256
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.660
They still blow the fucking game,

257
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:07.370
but I was so hoping to actually going to win the game.
Um,
but anyways,

258
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.240
uh,
the Patriots did so well against the dolphins.

259
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.100
That's the team that I want to show up on Thursday.

260
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:15.800
But the Thursday games a weird cause.
Everybody's fucking tired.

261
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.530
They usually sloppy as shit.

262
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.390
<v 5>And,
um,</v>

263
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.040
<v 3>I dunno,
I keep,</v>

264
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.860
I keep hearing Edelman is going to be back and then other people say isn't going

265
00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:27.520
to be back.
I don't know.
But if he's back,
you know,
we got that dude,

266
00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:31.300
you know who likes to party like me,
I'm in from Cleveland.

267
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.140
It help our defense can get a little pressure on the quarterback.
Something.

268
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:37.960
I don't know if we got a shot,
we got a shot to go on a little run here.

269
00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:40.180
We'll see.
We shall see what happens.

270
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.693
<v 0>MMM.</v>

271
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.230
<v 3>So I went to the gym today,
right.</v>

272
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.063
<v 5>And uh,</v>

273
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.420
<v 3>I forgot my headphones
and um,</v>

274
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.210
you know,
see that plane,
you don't gym music and Shit,
right?

275
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.433
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

276
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.580
<v 3>And Dude,
I got to say at my fucking gym,
it is so funny.
It's such like a,</v>

277
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.230
like I've,
I've,
I haven't been in a gym in like 11 or 12 years.

278
00:16:07.231 --> 00:16:08.580
I always worked out in my garage,

279
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.480
but now cause I need to do the lat pull downs to finally build strength up in my

280
00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:14.160
shoulder so I can finally do a pull up again.

281
00:16:14.161 --> 00:16:18.210
So I don't lose like 200 bucks when I turned 70,
because I can't do 10 pull ups.

282
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.030
That's the bet.
Um,
with Versie that I have.
And um,

283
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.600
so I joined this gym and I haven't been in the gym so long.

284
00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:29.040
Like there is just so many different fucking workouts,
Eh,
cause you know,

285
00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:31.410
back in the day they used to be,
I'd go to a gym and I'd be like,

286
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.930
that guy doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.
You know?

287
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.150
And that person really knows what they're doing.

288
00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:38.730
I should ask them for some tips on how to work out.

289
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.930
But now I haven't been in there so long and there's just so many.
I mean when it,

290
00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:44.850
last time I was a member of the gym,

291
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.870
like I don't think there was even kettle balls,

292
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.360
forget about all of this other shit where people stand on things like trying to,

293
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.013
<v 5>uh,</v>

294
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:56.251
<v 3>you know,</v>

295
00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:59.060
it's like they got half a beach ball that they're standing on it while they're

296
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:03.380
doing curls and they're also working their core.
I mean,
I dunno.

297
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.830
So then I see people doing other shit and it's just like,
okay,

298
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.750
so is that a legit exercise or is that person just fucking weird?

299
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.420
I saw a guy on,
on,
you know,
instead of doing dips,
he lifted himself up,

300
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:18.740
he locked his arms out

301
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.280
and then he was just like scissor kicking side to side.

302
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.970
Like he was running in the air.

303
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:30.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

304
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.140
<v 3>And I was like,
is that for your ankles?
Like what is,
what does that,</v>

305
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.220
I imagine that's something for your core.
He wasn't bringing his legs up though.

306
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.410
It was like he was just sort of running in the air.

307
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.130
Like you know those douchebags who do pull ups and they act like they're walking

308
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:46.160
upstairs.
You know,
like one person did it,

309
00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:50.250
it was cool and then 40,000 people did it and that just immediately became

310
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:54.810
Douchey,
like roller blading.
Um,
oh,

311
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:57.830
what did I hear this guy say today at the gym?
It was a self,

312
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.240
I was going to fucking write it down and I forgot

313
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.310
he was just talking about a show that he liked and I was just going,

314
00:18:06.311 --> 00:18:10.810
there's no way that wasF is for family.
He said,

315
00:18:10.811 --> 00:18:12.730
I just thought that they were really delicate with the,

316
00:18:12.731 --> 00:18:14.830
some sort of something sort of subject.

317
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

318
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.180
<v 3>So it was a guy talking.</v>

319
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

320
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.840
<v 3>I liked that show because they're really,
uh,
they cherish something,
blah,
blah,</v>

321
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:25.271
blah,
blah blah.

322
00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.730
I don't know if he was hitting on the woman he was talking to or whatever,

323
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.320
trying to act like we was fucking sensitive,
you know.

324
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.580
But I know they weren't talking aboutF is for family and speaking of F is for

325
00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:34.870
family.
Uh,

326
00:18:34.871 --> 00:18:38.800
Netflix put out their first bit of social media about a season three,

327
00:18:38.801 --> 00:18:41.590
which I'm very excited about it.
Um,

328
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.930
it,
uh,
dropped I think 11:00 AM or something.
I guess it's the next day.

329
00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:50.390
So you guys probably already saw it if you haven't seen it.
Fence.

330
00:18:50.391 --> 00:18:53.840
Vine is doing a voice to season and um,

331
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.220
it's probably the most fun I've had in the,
uh,

332
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.910
in the recording booth with somebody.
He,
that guy is like,

333
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.960
he's completely in his own land.
He is a fucking monster.

334
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.230
How funny that guy is.
And um,

335
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.070
I did my best to try to keep up with them,
which I don't think I did,

336
00:19:13.071 --> 00:19:15.820
but I'm once again just another,
you know,

337
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.440
huge person to add to the cast and obviously added the funny,

338
00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:21.260
that's why I think this is our best season.
And um,

339
00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:24.680
and it's obviously his production
company,

340
00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:27.710
wild west for the whole fucking reason that the show exists.

341
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.430
<v 2>Begin with.
So a,
I want to thank him and I want to thank all you guys.
Uh,</v>

342
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.120
if you're even thinking of watching it,

343
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.180
hopefully you will watch it and then we will get to do it all over again.

344
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.050
And hopefully this time next year I'll be talking about a season four,

345
00:19:41.051 --> 00:19:45.100
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
The Yankees,

346
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.150
I don't know what happened.

347
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

348
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.680
<v 2>It's,
it's the fucking day before.
Oh No,</v>

349
00:19:51.681 --> 00:19:54.620
it's today it's happening today.
Maybe there are they playing right now?

350
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.610
They're playing the Oakland A's and I,
I have no feeling about this game.

351
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.820
I have no idea who's gonna win this fucking one.
But,
uh,

352
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.910
like the fucking check in here.
What have we got?
Yanked

353
00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.870
<v 6>d</v>

354
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.520
<v 2>the Yankees.
Are they going to play tonight?</v>

355
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.000
What time it's on TV?

356
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:18.500
<v 3>Yes.
All right,
I'll have to check this out.
No,
you know what?</v>

357
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.480
I'll actually be going to the fucking airport so I'm going to miss it.

358
00:20:20.481 --> 00:20:24.050
Maybe I'll watch it on the plane.
Should be singing Yankee fans on there,
right.

359
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.760
Flying to whatever the fuck I'm flying to.
Um,
so anyways,

360
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:32.090
I got some ad reads to read here,
but I don't have them with me,

361
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.460
so I'm just going to say I have them and then I'm gonna I guess we'll drop it in

362
00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:39.410
through the magic of fucking,

363
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.580
I don't know what magic of editing.

364
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.710
Yeah.
So I'm definitely going to do,
uh,
the sober October thing.
I gotta do it,
man.

365
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:55.180
I,
I don't know what my deal is.
What is it?

366
00:20:55.181 --> 00:21:00.070
When if you drink,
you just fucking take it to the end,

367
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.360
but you can also just stop.
Where did,

368
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:09.280
where does that exist on,
like addiction,
you know what I mean?

369
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.400
Like,
I can literally just stopped drinking and I let her have alcohol sitting.

370
00:21:13.401 --> 00:21:15.550
I just walk by it every day.
I don't even fucking see it.

371
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.910
But then when I get back on,
then I just fucking,
I dunno,

372
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.650
just slamming them

373
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.150
then I'm thinking I used to be my last one.
This will be my last one.

374
00:21:29.151 --> 00:21:32.180
And I'm just like,
I'm still,
I'm still not,
I,
maybe it's my tolerance.

375
00:21:32.181 --> 00:21:35.480
It's like I don't feel anything.
And then the next day I wake up,
I'm like,

376
00:21:35.481 --> 00:21:39.850
oh my God,
I feel like Shit.
Whoa.
I was way drunk than I thought.
Um,

377
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.760
I'm always amazed at those people that can just sip,
you know?

378
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.200
Maybe it's just how I'm wired.
Like a bump playing drums.

379
00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:53.780
I'm going to fucking play drums.
If I'm going to go do a tour,

380
00:21:53.781 --> 00:21:57.310
it's going to be really fucking long or some shit.
And if I'm going to drink,

381
00:21:57.311 --> 00:21:58.360
I'm gonna drink.
So

382
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.620
<v 2>I dunno.
I'm just too fucking old for it.
And uh,</v>

383
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.980
I dunno,
but this is what always happens.
Now I'll,
I'll stop for awhile,
month,

384
00:22:06.981 --> 00:22:10.160
two months,
a fucking year or whatever,
and then I just,
I just get bored.

385
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.793
<v 0>MMM.</v>

386
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.320
<v 2>There's gotta be like a,</v>

387
00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.060
<v 0>okay.</v>

388
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.260
<v 2>It's gotta be a hobby that I can come up with.
Dude.</v>

389
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.850
These fucking people like chasing you around the fucking Internet.

390
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:29.140
Look at this art deco bar cabinet.
I looked up maybe getting an art deco bought.

391
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:31.690
Hilarious is I'm sitting there talking about I'm,
I could fucking drink anymore.

392
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.920
I looked that up

393
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.130
like fucking six months ago and they just keep,

394
00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.220
<v 0>okay.</v>

395
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.470
<v 2>Now I just clicked on it just to talk to you guys about,</v>

396
00:22:40.471 --> 00:22:43.410
and this will just never leave.
I don't give a shit what I,

397
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.850
I could be looking up something about platypuses and in the side of my fucking

398
00:22:47.851 --> 00:22:52.290
thing,
it's going to say art deco bars.
Look at the sinks.
Oh my God.

399
00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:53.400
They are beautiful.

400
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.590
<v 3>It's expensive as shit though.
Jesus.
Fuck you.
I he pain all of that.</v>

401
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.220
<v 2>My God.</v>

402
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.520
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

403
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.500
<v 2>Oh,
but they are abused.
That's David Shit.</v>

404
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.830
<v 3>I think also because I grew up watching bugs bunny that I like art deco shit.</v>

405
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.130
Cause if you watch bugs bunny,
there's a lot,
all the buildings and stuff,

406
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.210
you know,
which people you know really hate it.
To be honest with you.

407
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.670
When they first came out they didn't like art deco.

408
00:23:18.671 --> 00:23:23.500
They never liked the new shit.
You know,
like me,
I never liked the new shit.

409
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:25.630
What did I just bitching about?
Bitching about fucking Patrick.

410
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:28.960
My homes wasn't even bitching about him.
I think he's fucking great,
but she,
that,

411
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:30.410
that announcement,
my God,
I,
I,

412
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.700
those was a couple of times like I think this guy's going to faint.
I live,

413
00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:35.440
you think he's going to fucking pass out if this guy,

414
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:39.070
if he like hands off the ball and then they're given case keen,

415
00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:41.770
I'm no fucking respect whatsoever.

416
00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:46.250
The guy only went to the fucking NFC championship last year,
right.

417
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.720
Only beat the saints in the last play of the fucking game.
Right.

418
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.200
Granted that was the saints fucking up of,

419
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:57.860
speaking of which set guy plays on the cults now I believe.
Um,

420
00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.020
but uh,
I don't know.
Yeah,
I guess when that Shit first came out,

421
00:24:04.021 --> 00:24:08.040
people just did not like it on any level.
Ah,
look at that one.
Jeez,

422
00:24:08.041 --> 00:24:08.821
look at this other thing.

423
00:24:08.821 --> 00:24:11.910
You can't fucking see unique art deco whiskey bar cabinet.

424
00:24:11.911 --> 00:24:16.440
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to not drink?

425
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

426
00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.040
<v 3>When there's bars like this that I can buy.</v>

427
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:21.960
<v 0>Okay,</v>

428
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.360
<v 3>well what makes us a whiskey bar bill?
Well,

You put whiskey.
Oh,</v>

429
00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.243
there you go.

430
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:27.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

431
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.600
<v 3>It has little fucking holes in it.</v>

432
00:24:28.601 --> 00:24:31.630
What are you reached down and you get the bottle like that comes up like Michael

433
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.040
Jackson used to come up onto the stage.

434
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

435
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.920
<v 3>I don't know.
I don't like shopping online.
I'll tell you what I need,
man.</v>

436
00:24:38.921 --> 00:24:42.850
I need a fucking fly.
Swatter and mosquitoes are just off the hook right now.

437
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.880
Did I say off the hook that I say they are raising the roof?

438
00:24:45.881 --> 00:24:49.130
Did I used to watch fucking Arsenio Hall talk show back in the [inaudible] they,

439
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:53.390
I think I did.
I think I did.
Um,

440
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.950
yeah.
These things are like,
they are not taking any prisoners.
This is a,

441
00:24:57.951 --> 00:24:59.960
this is special forces.
Mosquitoes.

442
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:04.510
I got like welts on me and Shit and they are fastest shit.
Oh my,

443
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.000
my hand eye coordination isn't what it used to be.
Um,

444
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.730
but you really mixed the fly swatter is,
is the holes in it.

445
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.520
You know what I mean?
So as it's moving through the air,
it's like,

446
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.560
it's like the stealth bomber.
Nobody can here,

447
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.640
you don't even know it's got a fucking jet engine.
It's not,
they can't hear it.

448
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.970
It's,
it's that data.
They can't pick it up on radar.
Is that what it is?

449
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.530
I don't know.
I bet they can.
Now.
You know,

450
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:33.830
we don't admit it because he's spent so much money because it's like,
oh,

451
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:36.830
we can't find that thing.
And then they take pictures of it.
Oh,
that's what it is.

452
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.580
Okay.
It looks like a,
uh,

453
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.800
it looks like if someone was going to carve a cock,

454
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.420
meaning a dick in a lake and they didn't quite finish that in quite rounded off.

455
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.770
Um,
but anyways,
the flyswatter cause it has all those holes.

456
00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.760
It's like a Prius when it first starts off.
You know,
you can't hear.
Like,

457
00:26:00.761 --> 00:26:04.930
if someone's trying to run you down with a Prius,
when they first left the curb,

458
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.020
you wouldn't hear it.
By the time you really hear that engine fucking turned on,

459
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:12.700
it would be too late.
That's what it is.
The flyswatter is the Prius of,

460
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:17.400
um,
of fly killers,
I think.
Right.
Cause what else you got?

461
00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:20.450
You got that tape and you hang down.
Um,

462
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.910
I always thought that that was just brutal.
That fucking,

463
00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:26.560
that's like that mouse thing because you just go into the glue trap and they

464
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:30.990
like fucking ripping themselves apart,
trying to get out of it.
Um,

465
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.440
there's no need for that.
Right?
Just get a cat.

466
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:40.960
Those creepy ass fucking things.
Yeah.

467
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.810
If you get a feeling like somebody is stealing from you,
you know,

468
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.790
you've got just tells you you don't trust this person.

469
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.620
I've always felt that way about cats.

470
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:53.480
I don't fucking trust those things as far as I could throw in and I would throw

471
00:26:53.481 --> 00:26:57.140
in because it's going to land on its paws anyways.
Right?
Um,
anyways,

472
00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.120
I have a plane to catch everybody.

473
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.150
This is gotta gotta be the biggest bunch of nonsense I've ever said in my

474
00:27:02.151 --> 00:27:04.580
fucking life.
Um,

475
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.110
I'm going to be at the Boston Garden on Friday night and I'm getting together

476
00:27:11.111 --> 00:27:14.590
with some friends I used to play with back in the day to gym during the day in

477
00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:18.760
the arena.
This time,
unlike the forum,
I will not be going for fucking,
you know,

478
00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.120
three and a half hours.
Uh,
I,
oh,
I'm going to do,

479
00:27:22.121 --> 00:27:24.400
it's like 90 minutes or something.
Get in there,

480
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.750
have a good time and then just fucking,
you know,
leave them wanting more.
So,

481
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.180
um,
I want to thank everybody.
Boston.

482
00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:34.240
I sold more tickets than I've ever sold in my life.
I can't believe it.

483
00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:39.210
I'm actually in denial about it so I can fucking mentally get through it.
And um,

484
00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:45.160
it's really going to be crazy because I actually started my standup career at

485
00:27:45.161 --> 00:27:49.150
Nick's comedy.
Stop on Warren Street,
March 2nd,

486
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:53.980
1992 and 26 and a half fucking years later,
you know,

487
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:58.830
to be right down the streets.
Pretty cool man.
Pretty fucking cool.
Um,

488
00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.700
but it ain't going to be cool for freckles.
Has a bad show.
So,
uh,

489
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.710
I will be making sure.

490
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.710
Well that's good now because now it's sober October now I said it to you guys,

491
00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.510
you know,

492
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:14.140
and I love that Rogan does that shit cause it makes me want to fucking do it.
Um,

493
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.610
so if you guys can come up with a good rhyme for me,
maybe I'll go for November.

494
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.480
You know,
remember sober.
Remember November

495
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.590

It doesn't have a good ring to it.
What would have,

496
00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:30.450
I'll let you guys come up with it.
Send me,

497

And if it doesn't,

498
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.570

My bookie,
I you fucking doing.
Ah,

526
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.310
I'm sure watching football is fun,

527
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.820
but it's more entertaining when you have your fucking weeks paycheck on and off

528
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.700
when you have some action on the games.
Guys have,

529
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:37.210
you've heard me talk about this for weeks and some of you are still on the

530
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:39.520
sidelines,
whether you're an expert or a rookie,

531
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.240
you should be betting at my bookie.
If you're the kind of guy,

532
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.470
they're fucking legs to bed.

533
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:48.010
A little win a lot like playing the numbers on roulette.

534
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.510
You can create a big parlay,
picked three teams to win and if you hit all three,

535
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:56.860
you'll turn a hundred dollars into 600 if not,
you're going to lose 100 bucks.

536
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.810
It's not just football.
You can bet all major sports.
Take MMA this weekend.

537
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:04.600
Conor Mcgregor,
by the way,

538
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:08.370
inside story I heard all that bullshit about him party and all that fucking room

539
00:31:08.371 --> 00:31:11.350
is the inside.
I heard that,
uh,
that isn't true.
He was in great shape.

540
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.060
Whether it went so would not,
I dunno,

541
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:18.270
steps into the octagon on say for his first UFC fight in two years.

542
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.930
You can bet on things like whether he'll win straight up or weather cub Kabib

543
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.750
could be,
we'll deliver a first round knockout.

544
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:28.330
I recommend these guys because I really trust them.

545
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.990

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.480
If you're on the sidelines.

We're going to go head to head again above fucking time.
We'll see what happens.

557
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.760
It's a short series.
Anything can happen.

There's nobody on the planet like you.
Oh,

559
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:21.550

This is bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

621
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.790
October 4th,
2010 and I'm doing it really,
really late,

622
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.960
super late,
super,
super late.

623
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.160
Like that whore you bang the freshman year of fucking high school.

624
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:57.320
You know,
we'll stop stressing out about it.
That's what's making it not happen.

625
00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.700
You're not fucking pregnant.
Yeah.
And with that girl,
everybody had that girl,

626
00:37:01.701 --> 00:37:05.660
right?
The one girl who gets fucking pregnant,
like eighth grade,
ninth grade,

627
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:06.081
you know,

628
00:37:06.081 --> 00:37:09.530
you go back for your 10 year high school reunion and she's standing there with a

629
00:37:09.531 --> 00:37:13.250
22 year old.
You're like,
look at you.
Good for you.
Why you still got it?

630
00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.710
Actually that's my son.
MMM,

631
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:21.861
that's right.

632
00:37:21.861 --> 00:37:24.660
You standing there with their three kids and they all have like beards and

633
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:28.470
mustaches are a full rack of titties.
Um,

634
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.640
anyways,
I'm super late because,
um,

635
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.090
I hung around for an extra day in buffalo and uh,

636
00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:40.760
consumed about 9,000 calories.
I went to a,
the buffalo bills,

637
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:45.761
New York jets game and then afterwards I went to the Buffalo Sabre Philadelphia

638
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.520
Game.
And uh,
I just had a fucking awesome time out there,
man.

639
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.490
I'm the first night actually worked in Albany,
New York.

640
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:59.910
I was working the egg and I want to thank everybody who showed up.
Man.

641
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:03.530
I had a great turnout for both shows.
It's my first little,
uh,

642
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:08.280
my first little dip into the theater market.
Stuck my little toe in there,

643
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.770
you know?
Okay.
MMM.
Did I gotta tell you,
man,

644
00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:16.910
I had the scariest fucking flight I've had in like 10 years flying in from

645
00:38:16.911 --> 00:38:20.970
Chicago to Albany,
right.
I live out here on the fucking west coast now.
So yeah,

646
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.900
for some goddamn reason,
Los Angeles is this international airport.
But,
well,

647
00:38:25.901 --> 00:38:29.330
that's not true.
It's because it's the other side of the country.
Yeah.
I mean,

648
00:38:29.331 --> 00:38:33.810
I can get a fucking direct flight
to like,
uh,

649
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:38.350
I dunno,
Bakersfield.
I'm trying to pick some fucking obscure city,
but whatever,

650
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.680
to get to Albany,
I got to fly into Chicago and then I that which,
which,

651
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.690
which was no problem.

652
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:47.890
And then I flew from Chicago to Albany and when we came in on final approach,

653
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.480
I don't know what happened.
The guys like,

654
00:38:50.481 --> 00:38:54.640
we're coming in for final approach and we just was,
we were in this fucking soup.

655
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.130
We were in this job or whatever the pilots call it,

656
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.510
and we're just going up 500 feet down 600 backups,

657
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:05.320
seven and we're just in this shit.
And,
uh,
as I,

658
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:08.530
as I've stated before here on the podcast,

659
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.760
I don't mind turbulence when I'm way up in the fucking air,

660
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:17.230
I don't give a shit drop a thousand feet where 30,000 off the fucking ground.

661
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:19.000
I don't care.
Right.

662
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.310
But when you like coming in on final approach,
all of a sudden drop in five,

663
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:29.080
600 feet,
you know,
you start hitting TV antennas like back in the day,

664
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.200
like Fred Flintstone when he didn't want to get busted for whatever the fuck he

665
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:32.861
was doing.
Right?

666
00:39:32.861 --> 00:39:36.730
And he started driving around the neighborhood last so in the antennas,

667
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:42.010
what the hell was he doing?
Was He cheating on Wilma?
Am I doing some,

668
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:46.090
some stand up comedy material from the 1980s?
Is that,

669
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.760
is that what I'm doing?
Who is it?
Do it.
Um,

670
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:56.560
so we're just in this shit and this guy says we're in final approach.
Okay.

671
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.980
And like 15 fucking minutes later,
I'm,
I'm,

672
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.860
I'm just looking out the window doing what I always do.

673
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:03.940
Go and give me some lights.

674
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:08.230
Let me see some fucking lights of the city so I can figure out how high up we

675
00:40:08.231 --> 00:40:11.590
are so I can figure out how much I need to be freaking out.

676
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.250
And we just kept flying through the shit and it was like really,

677
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:19.060
really bad to the point I was actually feeling a little bit queasy.
Right?

678
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:22.030
And this guy's not saying shit and I'm thinking,
fuck,

679
00:40:22.031 --> 00:40:25.960
we're flying into Albany who flies into Albany,
you know,

680
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.090
is that the the fucking,

681
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.650
is that Tom Brady flying that plane or do we got the backup?

682
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.920
Why don't we know his fucking name?
Albany,
the studs,

683
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.500
they flying into JFK,
they fly into Laguardia,
they fly into Newark.

684
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.280
They don't fly into Albany.
Right.

685
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.980
So I'm sitting there freaking the fuck out going up.
God,
we got,

686
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.910
we got the fucking backup to the backup.

687
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.220
We get Trent Dilfer is backup pliant flying the Goddamn plane.
And uh,

688
00:40:54.221 --> 00:40:58.670
so I did some,
I haven't done in a while.
I started praying to God,
Huh?
Oh Gee.

689
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.770
That's how bad it was.
I the fucking hedge my bets going,
hey,
you know,

690
00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:06.730
I've been talking a lot of trash about you on the Monday morning podcast.

691
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:11.650
Wait a minute,
do I even need to explain it considering you know,
everything,
um,

692
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.360
now.
So I was like,
all right,
all right,
sorry for this.
Sorry for that.

693
00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:17.680
Sorry for my ceds.

694
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:21.760
And I'm really starting to get nervous because we're still fucking,
you know,

695
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.360
people's stomachs to drop in and I'm really fucking pray.
And,

696
00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.330
and then all of a sudden I heard this woman,
uh,

697
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.320
puke like 10 rows back,
right?

698
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.890
Everybody is like visibly nervous and no one has led out the bitchy scream yet.

699
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:41.120
And then I just heard this lady like 12 rows back.
Oh,
right.

700
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.350
So I start laughing my fucking ass off.
It's exactly what I need.

701
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.850
A little bit of humor so I can just completely pave over any sort of emotion

702
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.570
that I'm feeling.
And then we were back in the fucking chop again.

703
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.270
And then the pilot finally comes on and says,
yeah,

704
00:41:56.271 --> 00:42:00.080
they have us in a holding pattern because you can see this a storm.

705
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.340
And what I didn't get was,

706
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:06.320
why didn't you fly up above it or fly east of the shit or get away from it?

707
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.580
We just stayed in it.

708
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.930
We were flying in circles in this fucking storm and we would,

709
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:15.530
we would get to the point where it was sort of tolerable and then go back into

710
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:18.800
it again.
And,
uh,
it was really getting bad.

711
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:21.140
I was trying to read a magazine and made me like Carsick,

712
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.490
which I guess is air sick when you're up there,
but it's the same shit.
And uh,

713
00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:29.030
and then I heard this guy like two rows behind me,
you know,

714
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.520
he let out this really bitchy like,
Ooh,

715
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.840
as we were going over the thing and I actually made me fucking angry,
you know,

716
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.170
Christ say,
hold the fucking,
get yourself together,

717
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.900
fucking start making those noises,
making everybody scared you asshole.

718
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.850
So we did that.
That's what it was for fucking 40 minutes.

719
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:53.720
We were in this shit and uh,
people were puking.

720
00:42:53.721 --> 00:42:57.260
People will make an woo woo woo.

721
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.920
Like literally like that.
And,
uh,

722
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.220
and I'm sitting there trying to fucking remember what prayers you're supposed to

723
00:43:04.221 --> 00:43:08.240
say from back in the days when I was an altar boy.
Right?

724
00:43:08.241 --> 00:43:10.220
You're fucking rang the bells.

725
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.790
And on the third day he said,

726
00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.600
this is what I've done for you.

727
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.290
I can't remember how to say this is my body,

728
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.910
which will be given up for you.
That's why you ring it.
Dang it.
Dang it.
Dang.

729
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:29.690
With the fucking the bells there.
At least that's how we did it.
You know,

730
00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.840
that's the only lame attempt at my church we made to try to fucking compete with

731
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:38.360
whatever was going on fucking in the inner city.
Right?

732
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:41.360
They probably had Aretha Franklin headline and or some shit.

733
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:46.750
You just had me looking like a young fucking oop Cunningham,

734
00:43:48.561 --> 00:43:52.310
whatever the fuck it goddamn dude's name was.
I never watched that show.

735
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:53.210
The Andy Griffith show.

736
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:57.470
I always found it depressing watching those broadcast southern people that town

737
00:43:57.471 --> 00:44:01.130
drunk.
It was never funny to me.
So anyways,

738
00:44:01.131 --> 00:44:05.870
we finally fucking land and everything was good.
Go to Albany,
I do the Gig,

739
00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:07.130
everything's fucking great.

740
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:10.850
Then I go out to buffalo drive and across the state in New York,

741
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:12.950
absolutely gorgeous day.

742
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:17.270
And the second I even get within the facility,
first of all,

743
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:19.400
every told me it was a fucking five hour drive,

744
00:44:19.401 --> 00:44:23.690
six hour drive from Albany to buffalo.
What?
Uh,
I dunno,
I dunno.

745
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:28.310
I Dunno how people drive,
but a,
you can go a lot faster than that.

746
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.220
Three hours and 50 minutes you pussies.

747
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.400
So I go in there and the second I get into buffalo,
it's like fucking

748
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.890
pouring down rain.
I'm sorry.
I thought I hit the stop on here.

749
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:45.570
It just to me that it was the most miserable fucking weather.
And uh,

750
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.830
I ended up doing my show and I don't know what's going on.

751
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:52.290
I'm fucking tired and I lost interest in this story.

752
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.280
What do you think about that?

753
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.740
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

754
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.760
<v 7>how do I regroup here?</v>

755
00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.300
You know what fuck me up was I thought I stopped my record of,
God dammit.

756
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.890
This is why I don't do my podcasts on the same day that I fly is because I'm so

757
00:45:03.891 --> 00:45:08.030
fucking sleepy that I,
I can't,
I can't focus.

758
00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:13.350
I keep trying to fucking keep the momentum going and I just can't do it.

759
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.380
I just can't fucking do it.
Let's,
let's just try to hit the highlights.

760
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.380
I get to Buffalo,
I do the Goddamn show.

761
00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:25.330
I have a great time.
And the other comedian I'm working with,
me and Paul Versey,

762
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:29.230
we're like,
well,
you know this is buffalo.
They are known for their wings.

763
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.440
They're always talked and shit,
right?
Philly cheese steak.
You go to Philly,

764
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:39.010
you get a cheese steak,
right?
You go to fucking Atlantic City,

765
00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.400
you get you,
you get fucking,
you get your dick suck in the alley.

766
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.240
Right behind the fucking blue and beige Trump casino.

767
00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:51.130
You do you.
You do what?
The Ryan one in Rome.
You do what the Romans do.

768
00:45:51.131 --> 00:45:54.100
So fuck it.
We're in Buffalo.
Let's go get some goddamn buffalo wings.

769
00:45:54.101 --> 00:45:58.630
It's go get some wings.
So a,
there's two places to go.
You either go to Tufts,

770
00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:01.780
so you go to anchor bar and Duff's was right down the street.
So we said,
fuck it.

771
00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:04.120
Let's go there.
And I got to tell you,

772
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:08.410
you want to talk about living up to the hype.
Best fucking wings I ever had.

773
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.000
All right.
It had a crunchy outside.

774
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:16.380
You don't like what people don't know how to make the wings around the rest of

775
00:46:16.381 --> 00:46:20.490
the country when the crunch on the outside is crunchy.
That means a,

776
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:24.750
as my dad would say,
Christ,
you're cooked a shit out of bed.

777
00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.910
Um,
yeah.
Usually that means somebody over cooked it.
Oh,

778
00:46:29.911 --> 00:46:34.170
is my dad eloquently puts it,
cook the shit out of it.
So way he's always here.

779
00:46:34.171 --> 00:46:36.990
Christ,
you're cut the shit out of it.

780
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.260
Um,
face all twisted up.
Anyways,

781
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.530
that's back when you could curse in restaurants,
you know,
tell you it's so,

782
00:46:50.531 --> 00:46:53.670
we lost so many rights after nine 11,
I swear to God.

783
00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:57.150
Remember it used to be able to walk into Mcdonald's and you get your French

784
00:46:57.151 --> 00:47:00.180
fries and they would call and you could just yell at the manager,
Hey,

785
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.130
hey fucking dude.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the f?
Well,

786
00:47:05.131 --> 00:47:08.220
they're fucking cold.
I'm sorry sir.
Let me get you some other ones.
Yeah,

787
00:47:08.221 --> 00:47:11.410
you do that
right?

788
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.590
Isn't that what you were able to do or those my drinking years,
I can't remember.

789
00:47:14.591 --> 00:47:18.670
That's how I,
that's how I did it.
So anyways,
once again,

790
00:47:18.671 --> 00:47:21.640
I've lost my train of thought.
I don't know where I am.
Yeah.

791
00:47:21.641 --> 00:47:23.400
So we go in there and they're literally,

792
00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:28.680
they're fucking crunchy on the outside and they're dead juicy on the inside and

793
00:47:28.681 --> 00:47:32.470
they got unbelievable sauce.
And we got the duff beer.
It was the shit.

794
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.100
Now,
evidently when Obama went there,
this is another place.

795
00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:40.860
It's a place called anchor bar.
I guess when Obama went there,
he flipped a coin.

796
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:43.510
He went to Tufts.
So we went to the same place to president,
went to.

797
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:47.230
But then afterwards,
I'm half,
fuck it.

798
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.310
I've got to tell that part of the store out.
Jesus.
You know what this is.

799
00:47:51.311 --> 00:47:54.100
This is like,
uh,
the first draft of a script,

800
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.910
except this is all I got budget for.
This is like,

801
00:47:56.911 --> 00:48:01.870
does it mean to be like a fucking Edwood movie cut.
That was perfect.
Moving on.

802
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:06.490
So the next day I go to the,
the bills game.
All right.
And I'm,
I'm,
I'm uh,

803
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.650
I'm doing my little hundred dollar bet.

804
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:11.170
I'm picking three games against the spread.
Once again,

805
00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:15.220
this week I went one and two.
I went one and two last week on two and four,

806
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:19.690
a pitiful two and four.
Even if I teased my teams last week,

807
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:22.170
I still would have lost with the fucking,
uh,

808
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.530
Falcons beat and the saints and overtime.
So this week,
who did I have,

809
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.850
first of all,
dumbest thing you get,

810
00:48:28.851 --> 00:48:30.970
you can do as a gambler is I bet with my heart.

811
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.030
So I'm sitting there going to write the bills are getting five.

812
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:38.310
I know every football fan out there right now is going,
oh Geez.

813
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.640
That's cause you know the fucking final result.
All right.
I'm thinking all right,

814
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:44.170
the jets have been playing great.

815
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.000
They should go in and absolutely destroy this team.
It's fucking raining out.

816
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.450
It's a divisional Ravelry this is the exhibit and they got a couple of injuries

817
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:53.201
and the secondary,

818
00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:57.760
this is the exact kind of a fucking game that goes the exact opposite way,
right?

819
00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.860
And plus I hate the jet.
So I say fuck it.

820
00:48:59.861 --> 00:49:03.610
I'm taking the pills and then I also took the Bengals against Cleveland.

821
00:49:03.611 --> 00:49:05.710
I lost that one.
And there was one other one that I took.

822
00:49:05.711 --> 00:49:09.490
I pick the fucking ravens.
I got to stick with the Ravens,
man.

823
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:12.010
The Ravens had been good to me and so of the lions,

824
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.190
but I think the cat's out of the bag that the lions can actually hang so then it

825
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:19.270
can be getting fucking 13 point spreads anymore.
But anyways,

826
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.830
um,
so I show up there,
right?
And I'm walking into the stadium.

827
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:30.100
It's fucking raining out.
Ah,
Jesus.
I fucked this part of the story up to,

828
00:49:30.101 --> 00:49:33.550
you know what?
Fuck this podcast Greg.

829
00:49:33.551 --> 00:49:36.880
She had cooked the shit out of it.
Um,

830
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.090
yeah,
it was fucking raining on this one thing.

831
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:45.091
I've learned that when you go to a football game and you're dealing with the

832
00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:46.234
elements,

833
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.160
this is the more of a Douche bag you look like the warmer you're going to be.

834
00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.390
All right.
I saw the rain and I said,
fuck this.

835
00:49:58.391 --> 00:50:02.320
And we went right to Dick's sporting goods and I'm like,
I'm buying that fucking,

836
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:06.280
I'm gonna buy a raincoat with the matching raincoats slacks.

837
00:50:06.281 --> 00:50:07.450
I don't give a fuck.

838
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:12.400
I bought a pair of a wool socks and I was good to go.

839
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:18.100
So I'm with [inaudible] and you know they only had like two raincoats left and

840
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:22.680
they were the exact same color.
This fucking grapes,

841
00:50:22.681 --> 00:50:24.220
slush puppy purple.

842
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:28.380
So we both have matching extra large fucking jams.

843
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:34.090
We got the jacket and the pants like we're working at a fucking airport and what

844
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:38.540
green we're bringing in the fucking soul plane,
right?
That was a purple airplane,

845
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:42.080
right?
That's what we look like.
So we show up to the game,
right?

846
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.790
Neither one of us is comfortable because neither one of us is a jets or a bills

847
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:51.260
fan.
So we're in enemy territory and it's fucking drizzling and out.

848
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:55.910
It's fucking cold.
So I proceed to put on this Barney the dinosaur outfit,

849
00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.060
right?
And right off the bat,
Versie starts punkin outgoing man.
I'm just gonna.

850
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.210
I'm just gonna wear that.
I'm just going to weigh the top.

851
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.590
I'm just going to weigh the top,

852
00:51:03.591 --> 00:51:05.690
trying to act like it's not raining out that bad.

853
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:10.400
The reality is is he didn't want to go through the hazing that he would have to

854
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:15.110
if the two of us walked in with our purple on Purple fucking raincoats times

855
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:19.850
too,
we would have got a ton of shit and I was prepared to take it.
I had an,

856
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:23.720
I had a whole fucking silly walk I was going to be doing.
I don't give a fuck.

857
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.060
So he punked out.
So,
uh,
we ended up walking in and put my head's cold,
right?

858
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:32.750
All I have is a baseball cap on.
So I'm like,
fuck,
I gotta buy a hat.

859
00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:35.030
Can I buy a bills?
Who gives a fuck?
They were in last place,

860
00:51:35.031 --> 00:51:38.330
mangled by a bills hadn't.
Then I saw this,
this one with a Patriot logo on it.

861
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.560
I said,
fuck it.
I'll get that one.
So I put that one on.
I'm nice and warm.

862
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.620
We go to,
we'll call,
we pick up our tickets.

863
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:50.000
We go into that high school football stadium that they have out there that I

864
00:51:50.001 --> 00:51:53.390
actually love.
It looks like an old school football stadium.

865
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:56.630
You know what I like about that football stadium that's about the size of a

866
00:51:56.631 --> 00:52:01.040
football stadium that holds real fans.
You know what I mean?
All these,

867
00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:03.590
these new ones that hold like 100,000 fucking pets,

868
00:52:03.591 --> 00:52:07.400
all the bandwagon shitheads you know when you're all in for the real fucking

869
00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:08.870
fans show up are all in three,
right?

870
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:13.550
So he walked into the Goddamn stadium with love in life,
right?

871
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.670
I'm already laughing at Versie cause I know damn well what's going to happen?

872
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:17.960
He's going to walk out there.

873
00:52:17.961 --> 00:52:21.680
There's going to be some shitty little plastic seat that's going to be covered

874
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.940
in fucking water and the only way he's going to be able to absorb it is through

875
00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:28.820
his goddamn jeans and his fucking bbds.

876
00:52:28.821 --> 00:52:32.900
And then he's going to be sitting there with a wrinkled up nuts sack that's

877
00:52:32.901 --> 00:52:36.890
going to be getting hypothermia by second quarter.
Why do I know this?

878
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:40.880
Because I've been there.
So we get a couple of beers,

879
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:44.330
we get this fucking beef on a stick or whatever the fuck they call it.

880
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:47.600
We're good to go.
We go in there,
sit down,

881
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:52.550
he sits basically down in a fucking puddle.
He tried to stick a newspaper down,

882
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:56.380
which is a very absorbent and uh,
I don't know,

883
00:52:56.390 --> 00:53:00.110
we sat there and I had hope for about eight seconds in that game and the jets

884
00:53:00.111 --> 00:53:04.160
came down and just fucking Jew.
They just kicked the shit out of him.

885
00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:09.260
Christ.
They kicked the shit out of 'em and uh,

886
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:13.190
it was just over.
So we'd,
so immediately,

887
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:17.330
our solution is just to start drinking the way we drank at the masters.

888
00:53:17.331 --> 00:53:19.640
We're like,
fuck it,
let's,
let's,
let's get going here.
Right?

889
00:53:19.641 --> 00:53:24.320
So we'll make a trip after trip and all of a sudden I gotta take a Piss,
right?

890
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:30.050
So I go and I'm standing in line and all of a sudden this does fucking six foot

891
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:34.800
five goofy looking jackass.

892
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.230
One of those guys who's like six foot five,

893
00:53:37.231 --> 00:53:40.320
but you still think he can take him cause he's just covered in baby fat.

894
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.693
You know,

895
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:45.990
he's got a couple of whiskers on his chin and his cheeks are rosier than Saint

896
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:50.220
Nick,
right?
He's got this Jersey on and this big stupid,

897
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.390
I'm a buffalo bills fan with the horns on it and stuff,
you know,

898
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:59.040
he's the wacky guy,
so I'm not even thinking shit.
Right.

899
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.480
This is bill's jets.
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm not talking any shit.

900
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.410
I'm fine.

901
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:09.000
I forgot I was wearing my patriots hat and all of a sudden this big goofy

902
00:54:09.001 --> 00:54:12.990
jackass starts going,
well,
what's what?
Yeah,
well you're a patriots fan.

903
00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:16.530
He liked the rats.
We got a read over and the rats,

904
00:54:16.531 --> 00:54:21.320
he likes to fucking rats and the shit right?
And I'm like,
Yay.
Yeah,
no,

905
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:22.920
whatever.
He starts giving me shit.

906
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:27.380
I started giving him shit back then the weirdest fucking thing happened.
I,

907
00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:31.500
by the time I get in to the actual men's room,

908
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:36.570
I've talked,
I've given these people so much fucking shit that actually,

909
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.530
there's bills and jets fans at a bills and jets game.

910
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.670
They're playing each other.

911
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.940
They stopped giving each other shit and they teamed up together and started

912
00:54:47.181 --> 00:54:51.330
giving me shit.
Right.
And then I just said,
I don't know what I was thinking.

913
00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:56.010
I felt like I was on stage cause it was like a crowd.
I wasn't thinking like,
Hey,

914
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:56.790
you know what bill,

915
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:00.990
you really haven't had a fight outside of your family since maybe playing some

916
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.800
fucking street hockey in the sixth grade.
I didn't give a fuck.

917
00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:09.000
I'm in a God damn bathroom waiting to take a piss in a goddamn trough by the
way.

918
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.143
And uh,

919
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:14.510
and then they just started giving a fuck fucking this one dude such going,

920
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.830
Tom Brady sucks.
Dig.
He Sucks Dick.

921
00:55:16.831 --> 00:55:20.580
And he's like miming it like ridiculously well.
So I'm like,

922
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:24.990
hey you nobody do that.
Real wealth.
Because I learned it by watching Tom Brady.

923
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:29.280
Miko,
oh Yad,
you rent that porno,
you fucking fag gets a little uglier.

924
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.280
Gets a little uglier than this other dude.

925
00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:35.460
What the fuck did I came up with the hell he was saying to me and I just said,

926
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:39.780
look,
I'm sorry you guys have never won a super bowl.
You know?

927
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:41.940
Then the jets fan pipes in.
I go,

928
00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:44.190
do you realize the last time you guys won a super bowl,

929
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:47.160
Charlie Chaplin was still alive?
Do you understand that?

930
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:52.140
Do you know what cars look like the last time you won?
You fucking morons.

931
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.160
And then uh,
then this other guy go up until we've won three Superbowls.

932
00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.700
I'm sorry.
Right.
And then the guy goes,
well you didn't play in the games.
I go,

933
00:55:59.701 --> 00:56:03.930
neither did you.
Then he's just standing there with this dumb look on his face.

934
00:56:03.931 --> 00:56:05.630
I go,
that's where I keep staring forward.

935
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:09.720
You got nothing forgetting that I don't know how to fight.

936
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.300
So all of a sudden it's my turn to pes.
I take my dick out,
I'm ready to Piss.

937
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.250
And one of these fucking pussies pushed me in the back hoping that I was pissing

938
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:22.860
at the time.
Fortunately I wasn't.
So I turn,

939
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.910
I put my dick away cause I'm a gentleman.
I said you,
I go,

940
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.890
is that how you guys do it out here?
Really?
I go,

941
00:56:29.891 --> 00:56:33.040
which one you guys pushed me like I'm going to fuck.
I'm fucking Jackie Chan.

942
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:36.610
And for some reason none of them said anything.

943
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:42.220
I don't know if it was my purple on purple rain coat or the look of fire in my

944
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:42.371
eye,

945
00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:47.290
but I'm a fucking 42 year old balding redhead talking shit in there and none of

946
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:49.450
them said anything.
So now it's kind of funny to me.

947
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:53.990
I felt like I was in like the world series of poker and I went all in and I,

948
00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:57.610
and I didn't have a hand whatsoever,
so I don't know who the fuck pushed me,

949
00:56:57.611 --> 00:57:01.930
but that's what I mean.
Come on.
Bitchy is move of the fucking week.

950
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:04.330
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
How do you,

951
00:57:04.331 --> 00:57:07.770
how do you push another man when he's got his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss it

952
00:57:07.771 --> 00:57:10.060
to a fucking trough?
I mean,
how do you get lower than that?

953
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:12.460
Do you guys have any ideas?
How do you get lower than that?

954
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.660
So then after none of them said anything,
I go back and I started taking a piss.

955
00:57:16.661 --> 00:57:21.661
And then that other dude who was miming somebody's sucking a dick unbelievably

956
00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:26.701
well right next to me with one of those stupid hats that has the toggles on the

957
00:57:28.221 --> 00:57:31.480
side and he's still trying to give me shit and I'm going to add,

958
00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:34.690
go fuck yourself.
And then he just starts screaming over and over again.

959
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.560
Are you looking at my Dick?
How are you looking at my deck?

960
00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:41.860
Like maniacally,
like five times.

961
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:47.500
I just sort of stared at him like why do you keep going this,
this gay angle?

962
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.650
Like why is there always a,
I dunno.

963
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.520
I think he was one of those guys.
He was kind of in the closet and then uh,

964
00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:00.490
so he just goes to football games and he gets really drunk trying to just kill

965
00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:03.370
the families.
I think he liked me.
It's what I'm saying.

966
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.200
So if he's listening to this,
I'm sorry.
Uh,
I'm,

967
00:58:06.201 --> 00:58:09.160
I'm spoken for you fucking Pansy.

968
00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:13.480
You fucking believe that first of all,
what's wrong with me?

969
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.110
I really replay it all of that in my head.

970
00:58:16.111 --> 00:58:20.480
Cause once I got out of there I was like,
I really started thinking like,
what,

971
00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:22.180
what did you think you were going to do in there?

972
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:26.840
They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying things.
Clint Eastwood would say,
what?

973
00:58:26.841 --> 00:58:28.420
What the fuck is wrong with you dude?

974
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:30.760
Like I don't know if I've said this before in a podcast,

975
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.470
a public bathroom is the worst fucking place to ever get into a fight.

976
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:38.320
There is nothing soft.

977
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:43.500
This everything is porcelain pipes that concrete floor and then it has a mist of

978
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:48.790
piss and shit.
It's just a fucking,
it's the worst.
It's the worst place ever.

979
00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:51.003
You know,

980
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:55.330
not to mention it usually starts evidently when one person as begun the pissing

981
00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.164
process.

982
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.960
So,
uh,
you know,
older,
little bit wiser.

983
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:08.950
So then I'm standing in line to go get some more alcohol cause God knows that's

984
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:10.720
what you need after an incident like that.

985
00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:15.880
And I was just kinda just sitting there thinking like,
all right,

986
00:59:15.881 --> 00:59:17.770
now how should I have played that?

987
00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:23.780
It w it should have ended when the dude with the water buffalo hat started

988
00:59:23.781 --> 00:59:26.750
giving me shit.
What I should've done was roll with it.

989
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.620
I Shit you liked the Patriots.
I should have been like,
hey,
you know,

990
00:59:30.621 --> 00:59:35.000
you guys scored 30 on his last week,
man.
You guys look great man.
I bet the jets,

991
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.050
I mean,
I bet against the jets.

992
00:59:37.051 --> 00:59:41.890
I hope you guys should have just ended it with that.
Added it.
I've,
I sh I should,

993
00:59:41.891 --> 00:59:44.770
uh,
I should have extended an olive branch.

994
00:59:44.771 --> 00:59:46.360
That's what I should've done in the future.

995
00:59:46.361 --> 00:59:49.820
That's what the fuck I'm going to do because,
uh,

996
00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.100
that was a,
that was a potentially ugly situation,
but fortunately.

997
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:59.810
MMM,
okay.
I think the people who were doing it,
you know,

998
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.950
had jobs and no one wanted to get sued and no one was willing to take it to that

999
01:00:04.951 --> 01:00:08.650
level.
Uh,
and when I say fortunately,

1000
01:00:08.651 --> 01:00:10.450
I mean for me and my face,

1001
01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.000
<v 4>okay.</v>

1002
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.450
<v 7>Oh,</v>

1003
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:20.290
do you know how bad that would have been to get stomped in that fucking purple

1004
01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:25.180
on purple rain coat laying there with my dirty fucking patriots' hat

1005
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:31.740
and my team wasn't even playing.
Yeah,
I,
I would have lost the lawsuit.

1006
01:00:31.741 --> 01:00:35.410
They would have been like,
let me get this straight.
You're a patriots fan.

1007
01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:39.130
You were a patriots hat to a bill's jets game and you somehow managed to get the

1008
01:00:39.131 --> 01:00:42.760
shit kicked out of you.
What the fuck did you say?
You know,

1009
01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.060
that's one of the great things about being a guy is you actually have to take

1010
01:00:46.061 --> 01:00:49.210
responsibility for your,
for your actions.
See,
a woman would be like,

1011
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:53.830
there's no excuse.
There's no reason.
I don't care what happened.
You know what?

1012
01:00:53.831 --> 01:00:57.540
He had a girl,
which is true.
You don't need a fucking girl,

1013
01:00:57.541 --> 01:01:01.790
but there's no learning in that.
There's no lesson.
You know?

1014
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:04.950
Even my best friends would have been like,
yeah,

1015
01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:06.960
those guys are fucking assholes and the Bun,
you know,

1016
01:01:06.961 --> 01:01:08.910
that would've been an awkward pause.
I'm going to be like,
dude,

1017
01:01:08.911 --> 01:01:13.911
what the fuck he talking shit for by yourself at a game when your team isn't

1018
01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:17.550
even fucking playing.
What's wrong with you?
You 42 years old,

1019
01:01:17.551 --> 01:01:21.820
get your shit together and they would have been right.
So anyways,

1020
01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.070
fortunately the bills,
uh,
are smart enough to stop serving alcohol at halftime.

1021
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.760
So when I went to go get more beer,
um,
there,
there,

1022
01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:33.500
there wasn't any to be had.

1023
01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:37.800
So I walked back there and I'm laughing my ass off telling Versie the fucking

1024
01:01:37.801 --> 01:01:38.550
story.

1025
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:42.900
And he informed me that fucking Sanchez threw a bomb to that fucking drunk

1026
01:01:42.901 --> 01:01:47.740
driver there.
And um,
and I was just like,
God,

1027
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:50.630
Jesus,
here we go.
Here we go with the fucking patriots,

1028
01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:52.550
let up 30 points to this fucking team.

1029
01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:55.220
And the jets are raping him like this other patriots that bad.

1030
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:59.300
I say we were at nine and 17,
now I'm thinking fucking seven and nine.

1031
01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:04.630
So,
uh,
whatever.
So that was rough.

1032
01:02:04.631 --> 01:02:08.260
And then ended up getting into it with some other jet Fan.
I'm just a Dick,

1033
01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:10.090
I'm a dick when I'm sober.

1034
01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:14.680
And then you add alcohol and that goes to the next level.
And then I don't,

1035
01:02:14.681 --> 01:02:18.940
when I go to a sporting event,
I become another person entirely.

1036
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:23.460
I don't know what it is.
I just,
uh,
I don't know.
I love it.

1037
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.380
I love being at the game.
I'm at the stadium,

1038
01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:28.800
I get excited and then I'm a dick and I say,

1039
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:30.720
I say things that I shouldn't be saying.

1040
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:37.250
And I just started giving this lady shit and she was bragging about the jets and

1041
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:42.510
I just kept asking her over and over again,
what is it like to share a stadium?

1042
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:48.840
You know,

1043
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.930
why couldn't she just sit there and enjoy the fact that she was winning?

1044
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:53.220
Why did I have to ruin it?

1045
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.480
Why is my level of hatred for all New York teams to the,

1046
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.520
to that level?
It's pathetic.
It's really pathetic.
But it is what it is.

1047
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.080
So anyways,
most people would call it a day after that point,
but not me.

1048
01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.280
Not Jersey,
not us.
Fuck debt.

1049
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:15.660
We're going to the sabers flyers game after this.
There's more beers to be drank.

1050
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.011
So,

1051
01:03:17.011 --> 01:03:22.011
and we got to check out this fucking anchor bar to compare their wings to Duff's

1052
01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.410
right.
We're fucking doing buffalo up.
That's what you do.

1053
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:30.180
You sit out in the fucking shit.
Uh,
whether you watch the bills,

1054
01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:31.140
get their ass kicked.

1055
01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.140
Yeomans get beat down with your dick out in the fucking bathroom.

1056
01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:37.380
And then you go get some wings and hit the Sabres game afterwards.

1057
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:41.660
If there's something else to do out there.
I didn't see it.
Alright.

1058
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.470
Niagara Falls,
one of my,
on my fucking honeymoon
anyways.

1059
01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.900
Who goes to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon?
Huh?

1060
01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:54.000
How far back into this staples warehouse are you working that,

1061
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:58.290
that's where you go.
That's what I want to know.
So anyways,
uh,

1062
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:04.200
fucking cruise back to the hotel,
get out of our fucking,
uh,

1063
01:04:04.201 --> 01:04:08.460
uh,
Barney the dinosaur fucking raincoats and uh,

1064
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:14.040
I had to get directions.
We fucking flew down to the,
the Sabres game.

1065
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.950
This is what kills me.
We go to,
we go to anchor bar.

1066
01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:18.720
First I was thinking of the game was at seven,
at eight.

1067
01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:21.180
Turns out it's at fucking six.

1068
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:24.510
So we're pulling into anchor bar at a quarter to six.

1069
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:29.430
Get ready to have some fucking wings was still,
we're just having a great time,

1070
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:31.940
dude.
I can just put the windows down.
I could smell him.

1071
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.280
This is going to be the shit,
right?
Just let it,

1072
01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:38.700
I literally gained like 20 pounds yesterday.
So right as we pull in,

1073
01:04:38.701 --> 01:04:40.260
the radio comes on and says,
you know,

1074
01:04:40.261 --> 01:04:44.070
the Sabres Marie dropped the puck in 15 minutes.
So we're like,
fuck.

1075
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:47.700
And we start driving really fast,

1076
01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.890
not knowing where we were going to go because the plan was to get wings and
then,

1077
01:04:52.891 --> 01:04:57.630
you know,
with sauce on a Facebook,
oh,
whoa.
Shavers play.
That's that.
That was,

1078
01:04:57.631 --> 01:04:58.530
that was the game plan.

1079
01:04:58.531 --> 01:05:03.180
But now we have to fucking start driving and we ended up pulling over and uh,

1080
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:08.640
these three black dudes walking across the street roll down the window,
Hey,

1081
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:11.970
do you have any idea where the sabers,

1082
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:20.400
hi,
look at me breaking down stereotypes.
And it turns out,
uh,

1083
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.690
the dude where after actually African,
oh,
we go where,
you know,

1084
01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:28.540
how do we get to the HSBC SSC fucking arena?
And he's like,
oh,

1085
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:32.650
did is very far.
You hit the ball.
I carry,

1086
01:05:32.651 --> 01:05:33.940
I can't do an African accent,

1087
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:36.970
but I could just tell the way he was rolling his eyes that it was really far,

1088
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:40.960
but I was thinking,
wait a minute,
this guy's walking.
Does he mean by bus?

1089
01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.640
Who the fuck knows?
Whatever.
Long story short,
we ended up getting up there,

1090
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:48.070
so we just think we're going to walk up.
It's a preseason game,

1091
01:05:48.071 --> 01:05:51.980
but just going to buy tickets at the booth.
No can do.

1092
01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:58.840
I think I bought a bad pack of batteries.

1093
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.740
They said fucking Duracell on him.
I think they were bootleg.

1094
01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:05.740
These God damn things that are really good for a half a fucking hour.
All right,

1095
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:09.370
let's pick up the pace with the damn story again.
So we walk up there,
it's a,

1096
01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:14.440
it's a preseason game and we'd go up to buy tickets and they're sold out.

1097
01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:18.790
Unbelievable for the Sabres flyers that were like,
fuck,

1098
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.760
they're going to drop the puck in five minutes.
We go,

1099
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:25.300
we got to go scalps some tickets and I didn't see anybody selling near the
arena.

1100
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.110
And I came walking out and I see this nerdy looking white dude with a sweater

1101
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:33.010
walking up and I just yelled,
who's got tickets?
And he's goes,

1102
01:06:33.011 --> 01:06:35.710
I got two right here,
I got two right here.

1103
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:39.760
And then we'll fucking bottom off 60 bucks a whack.

1104
01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:43.990
Sat right on the club level.
They've got everything from Sushi to,

1105
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:46.000
I don't think I have Sushi,
but he had like ice cream,

1106
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:48.580
which is really fucking ridiculous at a hockey game.

1107
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.360
Maybe you get an ice cream sandwich,
but they had like,
it looked like a,

1108
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:57.460
what's that Italian rest?
Uh,
not restaurant.
They had Italian ice cream.

1109
01:06:57.461 --> 01:07:02.290
That's the gelato.
They get like that level ice cream.
You know,

1110
01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:05.020
are you really going to come back with that on a cone licking a cone?

1111
01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:10.020
As you watch two people beat the shit out of each other.
Um,
so anyways,

1112
01:07:10.021 --> 01:07:11.320
so then we get,
it's just,

1113
01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:16.390
first of all the sabers arena is the shit.

1114
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.000
All right.
For the exact opposite.
Read a reason that I love the buffalo.

1115
01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:25.870
I love the Buffalo Bills Stadium because it reminds me,
it's what,
it's,

1116
01:07:25.871 --> 01:07:28.060
what football stadiums look like when I was a kid.

1117
01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:32.290
And I'm not insulting you guys out there.
I think it's the shit.
I like it.

1118
01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:36.850
I hate those brand new fucking stadiums that are the size of a god Damn
Mountain.

1119
01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:39.910
I hate him.
I can't stand them.
They're too fucking expensive.

1120
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.770
They rape you in the ass for four tickets because they got to pay for the Fat

1121
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.090
Fox who sit in the luxury boxes,

1122
01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:49.570
who don't even give a shit about the damn team and they want to sit inside and

1123
01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:54.400
watch a game.
Fuck all those places.
So,
but the Sabres,

1124
01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:59.140
as far as a new arena,
man that's right up there with,
uh,

1125
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.820
as far as the new arenas goes,
the best one I've seen.
I like the Minnesota wild.

1126
01:08:03.821 --> 01:08:07.030
The Phoenix coyotes had a really nice one.

1127
01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:09.880
And the worst one I've been to was the Boston Bruins.

1128
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.920
We have the worst brand new fucking arena you are ever going to go to.

1129
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.050
It's like a bomb shelter.
They went out,

1130
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.040
they went down to the fucking Grossman's hardware and they bought up all the

1131
01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:24.260
cinder blocks in the state.
That's what they did.

1132
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:28.370
And then they just glued them together and painted them yellow and fucking
black.

1133
01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:30.920
There you go.
There you go.

1134
01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:35.921
That's what we will put the Bruins and the 17 time world champion Boston Celtics

1135
01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:40.370
Day you go give you some yellow plastic seats.
Have fun everybody

1136
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:46.190
but the sabers arena,
man,
I was,
I was,
it was beautiful.
Scoreboard was to shit.

1137
01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:51.110
And they had the uh,
the sabers head hang and that was fucking awesome.

1138
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:55.040
And then with the game was nine to two Sabres kicked the shit out of him.

1139
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:57.290
And uh,
you know,

1140
01:08:57.291 --> 01:09:01.760
I was making fun of those people who listened to the radio when they a watch a

1141
01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:05.060
game,
like what?
You can't see what the fuck's going on?
Well,

1142
01:09:05.061 --> 01:09:09.470
evidently I couldn't because I saw what I thought was uh,

1143
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.670
uh,
Daniel Carsello getting beaten down to the ice.

1144
01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.470
I saw this saber and this flyer go at it and they appeared to both drop the

1145
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:23.270
gloves and the Saber guy went wet dash where dash twice,

1146
01:09:23.271 --> 01:09:24.920
straighten this guy's face.

1147
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:29.210
And by the second one the guy was falling backwards to the ice and he did,

1148
01:09:29.211 --> 01:09:32.720
you know that final UFC,
you're not knocked out enough.

1149
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:35.640
I'm going to punch you as you're on the ground overhand,

1150
01:09:35.650 --> 01:09:39.740
right where damage to his fucking face.
And I was like,
wow.

1151
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.890
Wow.
Who was that?
Who did that?
And who was that?
Who got fucked up?

1152
01:09:45.891 --> 01:09:50.090
And then five minutes later cars Scilla was over by the penalty box and he got a

1153
01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:53.900
game misconduct.
I go,
did he do that to Carsello and was he embarrassed?

1154
01:09:53.901 --> 01:09:56.780
So he came out and he tried to do a handsome brother thing and fight him.

1155
01:09:56.781 --> 01:10:00.260
The second the dude came out and uh,
it turned out it wasn't him,

1156
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:04.660
it was somebody else.
And I heard he didn't even drop the gloves,
which is,

1157
01:10:04.661 --> 01:10:08.230
who explained why,
what does,
what does,
what does happen?

1158
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:09.861
How do you do that?

1159
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:12.200
How do you not drop the gloves when someone else drops the gloves?

1160
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.030
Even if you don't want to fight,

1161
01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:19.031
can't you just fucking drop the gloves to hang on and turn the other way and

1162
01:10:19.071 --> 01:10:20.450
give up the back of your head?

1163
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:28.010
How I would have fought in that bathroom.
Oh,
the noise.

1164
01:10:28.011 --> 01:10:30.470
Can you imagine the noise of five people trampling me?

1165
01:10:30.471 --> 01:10:34.700
The echoing the perfect acoustics of a fucking God damn men's room.

1166
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:40.040
Um,
anyways,
so,
uh,
and then we ended the night,
the end of the night we,
uh,

1167
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.260
we saw a great God damn game,

1168
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:48.490
saw that six 48 psychopath that I want to see Chara fight on defense.

1169
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.330
And then we went,
uh,

1170
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.360
we left and went down to anchor bar and we show up and get this for the third

1171
01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:58.610
time in the history of that place.
They ran out of wings.

1172
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:03.230
They ran out of winks.
Like you fucking kidding me.

1173
01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:08.000
Went down there to watch the giants game first.
He's a big giants fan,

1174
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:13.350
right?
So we go,
fuck it.
We'll stay here anyways.

1175
01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:18.530
And uh,
I dunno,
ask Paul about the edge.

1176
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.940
I don't want to trash the place cause I know which legendary,

1177
01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:25.941
but go on Paul's Facebook page and ask him how he enjoyed the mixed drinks there

1178
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:30.390
because a,
he had a little issue,
he had a little bit of an issue there.

1179
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:34.550
You know what I mean?
You know the deal.
Let me get,

1180
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:39.090
let me get absolute uh,
on the rocks and Eh,
absolutely.
You know,

1181
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:44.360
and then you just see them pouring it out of a fucking jelly jar and you're

1182
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:49.080
like,
yeah.
What,
what kind of absolute is that?
Eh,
Yah,
absolutely.

1183
01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.620
Uh,
my friends vodka that he makes down the street,

1184
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:56.820
you fucking prick.
So we actually didn't have a good time and anchor bar.

1185
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:58.000
We showed up and uh,

1186
01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.320
they were out of wings and then they tried to pass off as some shit.

1187
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:04.830
Vodka is the real thing.
Is that how they do it at the anchor bar?

1188
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.820
I'm still going to go back there and try their wings.

1189
01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:11.430
I gotta I gotta check it out.
I mean,
I liked everything inside.

1190
01:12:11.431 --> 01:12:14.580
You go inside there and they had like fucking,
it was like a motorcycle museum,

1191
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.010
like real motorcycles above it.

1192
01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:22.220
They had licensed plates everywhere from like Hawaii to like the northwest

1193
01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:27.180
territories.
They like license plate shaped like a bear in there.

1194
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:32.130
That's how far north these fucking ice road truckers come to calm down and get

1195
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:36.360
them sales,
some fucking buffalo wings.
So we did it up.

1196
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:39.600
We did Buffalo,
you know,

1197
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:42.210
actually if I got into a fight and loss but didn't really get hurt,

1198
01:12:42.211 --> 01:12:43.800
that really would have made,
that would have been great.

1199
01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.180
A little bit of blood in my purple fucking rain coat.
The fuck is wrong with me.

1200
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.730
But let's get to the questions this week everybody.

1201
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:55.731
This is actually a really a considering that that happened and um,

1202
01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:01.440
all right,
let me,
I just had somebody sent me a great

1203
01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:07.980
podcast question about that under the new topic,

1204
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:11.520
sports cuts.
Um,
and by the way,

1205
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:14.340
I'm going to get out of the sports talk after a while cause like remember when I

1206
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:17.640
went real hardcore conspiracy theory and talked about banks every week and then

1207
01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:18.451
that got boring.
Well,

1208
01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:21.080
the sports thing is only going to be interesting for so fucking long,
but uh,

1209
01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:24.780
we are,
we're really in the throes of it right now.
I know for a lot of you,

1210
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:29.990
this is like during the soprano's when Tony was in that fucking a out of body

1211
01:13:30.271 --> 01:13:34.080
state where he walked around,
didn't talk like Tony Soprano.
Remember that Shit.

1212
01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.940
Do Ya?
Okay.
Um,
let me adjust the levels here.
Hope these aren't too loud.
Okay,

1213
01:13:38.941 --> 01:13:43.470
so here it goes.
Sports cons,
uh,
Bill.
Um,
all right.

1214
01:13:43.471 --> 01:13:44.304
Anyway,
uh,

1215
01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:48.510
all of your jets hating made me want to email you a,

1216
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:52.530
I went to the jets pats game for week two.
I'm a patriots fan by the way,

1217
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:54.600
and I'd love to hear you,
uh,

1218
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:59.160
your take on fans who attend football games.
It's fucking incredible.

1219
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:02.160
I went with my girlfriend who was wearing a Brady Jersey.

1220
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.180
Now know that this isn't a way game.
Everybody,
okay.

1221
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:11.270
They went to New Jersey to watch the New York jets play in giants stadium.

1222
01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.850
It's judge joy,
which fucking middle is shut up.

1223
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.960
Um,
we pull into the parking lot and every,

1224
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:25.020
and people were literally moving their chairs into the open parking open parking

1225
01:14:25.271 --> 01:14:30.130
space,
not letting me park saying patriots aren't allowed here.

1226
01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.810
And He,
the guy writes,
ha ha ha,
I get it now.
Can you please move?

1227
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.030
No one would fucking move.
It's amazing.
It's like,
okay,
I fucking get it.

1228
01:14:40.031 --> 01:14:42.820
You hate the patch now.
Get the fuck out of my way and let me park.

1229
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.920
So they finally move and we get out and start walking towards the stadium.

1230
01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.680
He goes,
these people start following us,
calling us every name you can think of.

1231
01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.660
Um,
and he's like,
like,
really?
Do you have a f?

1232
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.120
F what?
Do you have a fucking family or anything else in your life?

1233
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:07.900
You take this game,
this seriously?
I would've said something,

1234
01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:12.560
but there were like nine guys.
Well,
Hey,
welcome to my world.
Welcome to mind.
Well,

1235
01:15:12.561 --> 01:15:17.290
he just thank,
thank God you weren't taking a piss at that time.
Uh,

1236
01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:21.700
but they were like nine guys and like six girls calling me a patriots loving

1237
01:15:21.701 --> 01:15:24.790
faggot.
Then he writes faggot.
Really?

1238
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:29.560
So we keep walking and pass.
Some normal people who heckle in the right way.

1239
01:15:29.561 --> 01:15:34.420
You're going down,
Brady sucks.
I get that.
Ha Ha.
It's fine.
Um,

1240
01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.100
breast come back by the way is just to keep walking through the parking lot,

1241
01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:41.780
responding with 1969.

1242
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.860
They hate that,
but I only pull that card in response.
Okay.

1243
01:15:47.861 --> 01:15:49.300
So now we're going up the escalator.

1244
01:15:49.301 --> 01:15:54.301
Some guys going the other way on the escalator and starts screaming.

1245
01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:58.630
You're almost as ugly as that fucking Brady Jersey you have on.
Oh,

1246
01:15:58.631 --> 01:16:01.750
they're saying that to your girlfriend.
Wow.
Go Back to Boston.

1247
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:05.710
You faggot a what the fuck?
Uh,
then,
uh,

1248
01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:10.720
at our seats there was a fucking juiced up roid head screaming his fucking face

1249
01:16:11.561 --> 01:16:16.120
off,
turning red,
punching the shit out of the seats,
screaming the entire game.

1250
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:20.800
There was a fucking dad and his 12 year old daughter in front of us.

1251
01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:26.620
Anyway,
I just love to hear your take on these fucking lunatics.
Like,
I get it.

1252
01:16:26.621 --> 01:16:30.280
You love football,
but really,
is there nothing else in your life that you take,

1253
01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:35.230
uh,
this seriously?
Um,
all right.

1254
01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.940
Um,
well,
you're talking to a guy who's been on boats.
I've never gone,

1255
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:43.750
I've never called someone a faggot.
I never do that.
There's more of us than you.

1256
01:16:43.751 --> 01:16:46.540
So much trying to intimidate you.
Think I'm more the,
uh,

1257
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:51.100
loan wise ass talking shit to someone who can beat the shit out of me.

1258
01:16:51.101 --> 01:16:53.500
But this is what you got to understand.
All right?

1259
01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:58.510
Just to avoid these situations as sports fans,

1260
01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.980
um,
this is,
this is what I've found.
You can,

1261
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:07.030
all right,
first of all,
if you're going to go into another person's stadium,

1262
01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.130
okay.
And not only where,

1263
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:13.310
and not the other team's Jersey,

1264
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:18.490
but the Jersey of a team that is literally kicked the shit out of the other

1265
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.310
team.
I mean,

1266
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:26.660
the Patriots since 2001 have basically kicked the shit out of the jets twice a

1267
01:17:26.661 --> 01:17:30.650
year.
Every fucking year for almost 10 years or the very least,

1268
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:34.790
we've won like 80% of the fucking games.
Um,

1269
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:39.640
so that jersey,
it's like,
you know,
you got to understand that's,
yeah.
You're,

1270
01:17:39.641 --> 01:17:43.730
you're bringing up a lot of bad memories.
Um,
and I,
yeah,

1271
01:17:43.731 --> 01:17:46.490
those people who actually don't let you park there.
Yeah.

1272
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:50.510
They are taking it too far,
that there's a little bit on both sides,

1273
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.230
you know what I mean?
It's like you kind of,

1274
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:57.860
you know,
you know,

1275
01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:02.060
slice in your leg and then jumping in a shark infested water and then getting

1276
01:18:02.061 --> 01:18:06.950
upset that you get in your fucking leg bid off.
I mean,

1277
01:18:06.951 --> 01:18:11.450
I think it's bullshit.
I don't know,

1278
01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.470
but I do get it.
Like people should get shit.
Okay.

1279
01:18:15.471 --> 01:18:19.370
That roided out guys.
Who's,
who's punching the back of the seats like that?

1280
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:23.110
I mean,
that's,
that's kind of par for the course.
I hate to say it,

1281
01:18:23.111 --> 01:18:25.670
it is par for the course.
Like the eagles fans really get,

1282
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.990
or Philly fans get way too much credit for psychos.

1283
01:18:29.991 --> 01:18:31.790
They kind of act,
it's kind of like racism,

1284
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:35.150
how they act like it's only white people in the south,
you know,

1285
01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.380
like that's where it is.

1286
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:40.790
And it's kind of like Philly gets all the shit or credit depending if you're

1287
01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:41.301
proud of it.

1288
01:18:41.301 --> 01:18:46.160
And not that like only moron asshole fans are in Philly.

1289
01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:48.740
I mean,
I've been to games in Philly.
The word,

1290
01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:50.810
one of the worst experiences I had was,
uh,

1291
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:55.100
going to a San Diego chargers game once again with my Patriot fucking hat on

1292
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:59.570
like an asshole.
You'd think I'd learned from that.
Um,

1293
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.170
yeah,
my take on that is,
yeah,
you know,

1294
01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.200
there should be this fun talking shit and then there's the talking shit where

1295
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:13.910
it's not fun.
Like someone pushes you way trying to take a piss or they start,

1296
01:19:13.911 --> 01:19:14.570
you know,

1297
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:17.660
saying your girlfriend's ugly or whatever the fuck they were trying to say
there.

1298
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:22.970
Um,
but you know,
if you wear the Jersey Elio team,
you walk in,

1299
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:27.971
you got to expect that someone's going to call you a pussy or probably throw the

1300
01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.090
last bite of their hot dog at you.
What's going to happen?

1301
01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:36.500
People are drinking and uh,
you know,
a lot of people don't like their lives.

1302
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.770
They don't like who they're married to.
Maybe they don't like their job.
Um,

1303
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.060
or maybe they're just a dick,
who knows.

1304
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:47.320
But you got to understand that basically,
you know,

1305
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:53.360
you wore the Jersey of a team that's won three super bowls into the stadium.

1306
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:56.030
Have a team that,
like I said,

1307
01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:59.600
Charlie Chaplin was alive the last time that jet's wanted.
Okay.

1308
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:01.880
Harry Truman was alive.

1309
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:07.860
Dwight d Eisenhower was alive the last time that jet's wanted.
All right.

1310
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.780
And I'm not trying to give the judge Shit,
I'm just,

1311
01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:11.220
I'm just trying to show compassion here.

1312
01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:15.810
Brett Farve wasn't even alive the last time that jets it.
Okay.

1313
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.910
So you,
you gotta,
you gotta be a little more compassionate to the jets fan.

1314
01:20:20.911 --> 01:20:21.121
I mean,

1315
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:25.770
like the Dallas cowboys were considered bridesmaids could always get to the big

1316
01:20:25.771 --> 01:20:30.510
dance,
but could never win it.
The last time the jets,
when the Superbowl,

1317
01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.860
you know,
Richard Nixon was president.

1318
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.250
Spiro Agnew was vice president.

1319
01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.950
Costs of a new home was $27,500.
That was the average price.

1320
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.040
Average cost of a new car was $3,270 the last time that Jay,

1321
01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:58.020
I'm not giving the judge Shit here by bringing out these staggering facts.

1322
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.210
I'm just trying to say,
you know,
you gotta,
you gotta show a little compassion.

1323
01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:07.650
You have to understand that these poor bastards,
the last time they want it,

1324
01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:11.340
the population of this country was only at 202 million.

1325
01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.590
Do you understand that
they have one in a long fucking time,

1326
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:20.220
price of gas was 35 fucking sense.

1327
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:24.350
Do you really think that you're gonna walk in with the Jersey of a guy who's

1328
01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.320
created them so much fucking misery,
who has a haircut that they can't stand?

1329
01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:31.380
Who's banging the hottest fucking broad in the planet right now?

1330
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:36.330
You don't live in the life that they want to live,
but can't,
you know,

1331
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.890
as they strain in the upper deck to try to figure out what the fuck is going on.

1332
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.510
Yes.
You're going to get called a faggot.
Do I think it's right?
No,
I,

1333
01:21:45.511 --> 01:21:47.700
I wish there was friendlier ball busting.

1334
01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:52.170
I really wish that more people knew how to break balls and including myself.

1335
01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:57.300
More people knew when to shut the fuck up like me.
You know,

1336
01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:02.520
like I should have,
I should have tapped out buddy and I didn't.
So,
uh,

1337
01:22:02.521 --> 01:22:04.200
anybody have any a bad sporty.

1338
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:08.280
What's your worst experience as a fan?

1339
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.740
Like I could tell you,
like back in the day,

1340
01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:15.820
I would wear like a red sox hat to a Yankees game in Yankee stadium before 2004,

1341
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:19.410
I would do it because,
you know,

1342
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:21.661
we had,

1343
01:22:21.661 --> 01:22:26.400
what did we do to them except blow leads and lose.

1344
01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:30.090
But once we fucking hung the biggest choke and professional sports history

1345
01:22:30.091 --> 01:22:33.360
around the God damn next,
then it became a different thing.

1346
01:22:33.361 --> 01:22:34.410
And then we wanted it again.

1347
01:22:34.410 --> 01:22:37.860
And then all of a sudden I noticed it started getting hostile.
I was like,

1348
01:22:37.861 --> 01:22:39.510
all right,
this isn't cool anymore.

1349
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.690
This isn't being taken is that this isn't a funny thing anymore.

1350
01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.450
This I'm not the fucking,
uh,

1351
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:47.940
the fucking happy go lucky kid who was just hoping to see it once.

1352
01:22:47.941 --> 01:22:50.910
I've seen it twice since the last time they want it.
And I,

1353
01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:55.920
it noticeably got ugly the same way the Patriot's stadium went from a,

1354
01:22:56.431 --> 01:23:00.480
an absolute fucking zoo to being this,

1355
01:23:00.481 --> 01:23:04.590
this sort of classier place to go see a Goddamn game when we were winning.

1356
01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:08.790
And that was the thing.
Anybody can be classy when they're winning,
but you know,

1357
01:23:08.791 --> 01:23:11.930
you see who the fans really are when you're fucking losing.
Yeah.

1358
01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:13.660
Like when the Patriots,
I mean,

1359
01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:16.940
red sox finally beat the Yankees and that they didn't like when a rod slap the

1360
01:23:16.941 --> 01:23:19.100
ball down.
They didn't like that.
They didn't get that call.

1361
01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:21.590
Like they had been so many other fucking years.

1362
01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:26.420
That goddamn fans pulling routine fly balls into the fucking stands for home

1363
01:23:26.421 --> 01:23:29.710
runs.
Reggie Jackson leaning into the ball.

1364
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:32.500
They always get those calls and all of a sudden they didn't get and they threw

1365
01:23:32.501 --> 01:23:36.190
fucking temper tantrum started littering the field.
Right.

1366
01:23:36.191 --> 01:23:40.810
The classy Manhattan nights that they are.
So,
I dunno.
Yeah.

1367
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.490
Um,
yes.

1368
01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:47.730
Basically all sports fans behavior needs to be a needs to improve.

1369
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:52.000
And uh,
it starts with me just like that Michael Jackson Song.

1370
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:56.520
Huh?
Starting with the man in the mirror.
Um,

1371
01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.420
no one did.
They push me purple on purple rain coat.

1372
01:24:00.421 --> 01:24:03.120
I wasn't even fucking thick and I would've pushed me too.
All right.

1373
01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:07.290
Question of the week.
Uh,
somebody wrote bill,
why do you hate stoners?

1374
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:11.510
Oh yeah.
Cause last week I was making fun of my stone of friend.
Uh,

1375
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.040
I don't hate stoners.
I was,
I'm,

1376
01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:17.960
I don't like stoners who call me up and trash my life because they don't like

1377
01:24:17.961 --> 01:24:22.250
their own.
All right.
Stop making it about yourself.
All right,
Eh,
ah,

1378
01:24:22.251 --> 01:24:25.510
this person actually wrote and thought that I smoked weed,
which is a,

1379
01:24:25.511 --> 01:24:29.060
that's one of the things that is a known annoying about stoners is after they

1380
01:24:29.061 --> 01:24:30.320
smoke long enough,

1381
01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:35.740
they think that the only way to have creative thought is to be sucking the Dick

1382
01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:37.160
of that plant.

1383
01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:40.993
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1384
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:47.210
<v 7>Well,
I just lost my stone pub.
I just don't,
uh,
um,
I don't,
you know what it is.</v>

1385
01:24:47.211 --> 01:24:52.180
I don't like the fucking,
I don't like putting smoke into my lungs.
I just,

1386
01:24:52.181 --> 01:24:54.520
you know,
there's two things.
You don't want your lungs,
okay.

1387
01:24:54.521 --> 01:24:56.380
You don't want smoke and you don't want water.

1388
01:24:56.850 --> 01:25:01.560
So I wouldn't slowly inhale a glass of water.
You know,

1389
01:25:01.561 --> 01:25:05.110
and slowly drown myself over 60 years.
I wouldn't do that either.
But,
uh,

1390
01:25:05.111 --> 01:25:09.330
I have to admit,
I,
I've tried weed a couple of times.

1391
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.090
I didn't try it until I was like 37 to how hilarious is that?

1392
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:17.310
And then I finally tried it and it was exactly what I was afraid of was I

1393
01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:21.600
fucking loved it.
But,
uh,
I just can't,
I just can't get that,

1394
01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:25.140
that image of that person is smoking through the hole in their throat.
I just,

1395
01:25:25.141 --> 01:25:28.310
yeah.
I don't want lung cancer,
so I don't fuck with it.
But,
uh,

1396
01:25:28.311 --> 01:25:32.420
it's a lot harder to see your liver shriveling up as you booze.

1397
01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:36.200
MMM.
Anyways.
Hey Bill,
have you seen the,
uh,

1398
01:25:36.201 --> 01:25:41.080
the infomercial for the I renew bracelet?
I'm sure you have.

1399
01:25:41.081 --> 01:25:45.250
It's this magic bracelet that makes you have better balance,
strength,
endurance,

1400
01:25:45.251 --> 01:25:49.600
and sleep better.
Hell,
you might even be wearing one right now to bring up,

1401
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:52.160
to bring the funny out in you.
Uh,

1402
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:55.990
it's a little piece of rubber with the shiny piece of metal on it probably cost

1403
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:58.860
$2 to make a hundred of them.
Um,

1404
01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:03.040
it channels your body's energy or some shit.
Maybe it works.
I don't know.

1405
01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:07.100
You know what's crazy?
People are buying these things for $20 a pop.

1406
01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.410
Someone is getting rich off this gimmick.

1407
01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:13.460
God bless them for finding an angle to make some dough.
Uh,

1408
01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:17.930
I think it's in the same category as the $50 gold coins for 10 bucks.

1409
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.060
Yeah,
it's exactly at,

1410
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:25.090
I think whoever came up with that as a genius and those really bad actors where

1411
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:27.500
they,
they act like they can't stand upright.

1412
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:32.270
Yet somehow they were able to make it to the mall to go on film with those

1413
01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:35.420
stupid braces.
And the second they put the bracelet on,
oh my God.
It's amazing.

1414
01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:40.010
Like I can't believe it.
Um,
the APP,
Bryce,
which are a great way to go.

1415
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:45.170
You know what you do make a bracelet that actually says a,

1416
01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:49.760
it'll make your dick bigger or give you a flat tummy for the ladies.

1417
01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:54.620
You know,
something like that.
I Dunno,
I'm getting sleepy again.

1418
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:58.520
I've told you some good stories here,
haven't I?
You know,

1419
01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:00.620
the last time that jet's won the Superbowl,

1420
01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:04.040
Jim Brown was the all time rusher leading rusher.

1421
01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:06.350
And behind him was Joe Perry,

1422
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:11.830
not from Aero Smith.
Joe Perry from 1948 or so.

1423
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:15.140
I don't really know all the fuck he played for the top three with Jim Brown,

1424
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:18.050
Joe Perry and Jim Taylor.
Okay.

1425
01:27:18.051 --> 01:27:23.051
The guy from fucking Aerosmith was second behind Jim Brown in rushing.

1426
01:27:24.261 --> 01:27:27.110
That's how long it's been since the jets have one.
It's so,
yeah,

1427
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:32.111
you can't wear a Tom Brady Jersey d down there by the way.

1428
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.600
Thank God my patriots fucking one tonight.

1429
01:27:37.941 --> 01:27:42.560
Jesus Christ.
And I'll tell you as much as the score was,
uh,
you know,

1430
01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:45.950
lopsided,
there is a lot of water.

1431
01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:50.570
There's a lot of water leaking into that ship.
Jesus Christ,

1432
01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:53.810
I don't know what the fuck is with our defense,

1433
01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:57.650
but so much of the game we look like we're in a prevent,
it's fucking ridiculous.

1434
01:27:57.651 --> 01:28:01.760
So my big prediction this week,
now,
my big prediction,

1435
01:28:01.761 --> 01:28:05.420
my big question this week is if Ben Roethlisberger comes back,

1436
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.080
doesn't miss a goddamn step and just plays the way that guy can play.

1437
01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:17.540
And that defense plays the way it's been playing.
Uh,
I put them a top,

1438
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:20.000
the AAFC I would say that they had,

1439
01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:24.710
they are the team to beat the fact that they went three and one with a third

1440
01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:28.910
string fucking quarterback and basically all,
I mean we're,

1441
01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.150
we're what they lost in like the last play of the game.
They know they would,

1442
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.980
they were that close to going for no,
that's how good their fucking defenses.

1443
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:40.850
And then not only that,
that third string quarterback got all that experience.

1444
01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.890
I'll tell you if big Ben comes in,

1445
01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:48.460
right and just kicks ass and then they just stick them in an armored car and

1446
01:28:49.761 --> 01:28:52.730
they drive him past all those Hooters and just get them home.

1447
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.330
I think the Steelers might be going for number seven.

1448
01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:01.740
How fucking Badass would that be?
That would be that.
That would be something.

1449
01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:04.620
Um,
all right,
here we go.

1450
01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:07.330
I remember a couple of years ago we were one Superbowl behind them.

1451
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:09.960
Like here we go,
Steelers and next we're going to catch them.

1452
01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:12.570
And then what happened?
Nothing.

1453
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:17.130
Then they want to more so we're fucking in the dust again.
All right,

1454
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:20.340
asshole friends.
I asked you guys for some stories about asshole friends.

1455
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:25.050
Here's one for you.
Uh,
just wanting to,
so,
uh,
the,
the right off the bat.

1456
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.230
Okay,
where do I start this?
Fuck you guys.

1457
01:29:28.231 --> 01:29:30.550
I'm tired when I just start at the beginning.

1458
01:29:30.551 --> 01:29:33.020
He just wanted to say and know exactly what it's like to have a buddy always

1459
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:37.050
seems to have shit in his diaper and just has that puppy dog look in his eye

1460
01:29:37.051 --> 01:29:41.850
that says,
hey bro,
can you deal with my shit before I get a rash?
Uh,

1461
01:29:41.851 --> 01:29:45.810
last night I was at a local bar just relaxing and enjoying a couple of beers

1462
01:29:45.811 --> 01:29:50.190
with the girl I'd been talking to and a buddy I hadn't seen in about a year.

1463
01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:52.950
Moseys on over.
I'm excited.
You know,

1464
01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:57.900
he's an old high school buddy and I'm expecting to have a good couple of good

1465
01:29:57.901 --> 01:30:02.700
last with this guy right off the bat.
I ask him how he's doing.
Uh,

1466
01:30:02.701 --> 01:30:06.330
just expecting them to say,
you know,
say something like,
good,
how about you?

1467
01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:11.040
Like any normal icebreaking human being,
right?
But he says,

1468
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.390
I say,
how you doing?
Uh,
he just size

1469
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:22.440
and looks at his beer and then do his feet.
And I'm just like,

1470
01:30:22.441 --> 01:30:25.860
God damn it.
Here we go.
He goes on about,
I was,

1471
01:30:25.861 --> 01:30:30.270
mommy kicked him out of the House that he's got something wrong with his neck,

1472
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:34.110
that a heat pad won't get out,
something about a Dui.

1473
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:37.590
Then he has the nerve to complain how he got turned down for government

1474
01:30:37.591 --> 01:30:42.240
assistant checks.
It's like,
if,
have you ever heard of AIDS in Africa,

1475
01:30:42.241 --> 01:30:46.380
motherfucker of Jesus.
You went all the way to the end with that one.
Uh,

1476
01:30:46.381 --> 01:30:49.440
needless to say,
I'm getting annoyed at this point,
and I say,
well shit man.

1477
01:30:49.441 --> 01:30:53.040
You know,
we all got to grow up.
What a great fucking line.

1478
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:57.480
Then I offered to talk to my boss to try and get this guy a job so he can get

1479
01:30:57.481 --> 01:31:00.300
back on his feet.
He then looks offended,

1480
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.660
pissed off that he didn't rub his belly wipe is bubbling lips and tell him

1481
01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:08.850
everything was going to be just fine and throw a couple of quarters into his

1482
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.020
Little Tin Cup.
Exactly,
exactly.

1483
01:31:13.021 --> 01:31:17.760
How old are you fucking move on and get a God damn job,
you bum.
Um,

1484
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:21.900
so anyways,
the guy announces when he,
after the kid said,
uh,
you know,

1485
01:31:21.901 --> 01:31:23.430
we all got to grow up sometime he,

1486
01:31:23.431 --> 01:31:27.330
and he announces I wasn't born to be a slave dude.

1487
01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:31.800
Fuck that noise.
And I'm just thinking,
yeah,

1488
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:36.180
maybe you shouldn't have been born at all.
As I turned back to my lady,

1489
01:31:36.570 --> 01:31:37.920
I know that's a harsh thought,

1490
01:31:37.921 --> 01:31:41.430
but when you're born with the fully functioning brain in a nice area,

1491
01:31:41.431 --> 01:31:46.050
with a good educational system,
with every opportunity in the world to not suck,

1492
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:49.530
and you still apply for government assistance,
it's like,

1493
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:55.760
do as tacs rape victims of favor and do a triple Lindy Rodney Dangerfield styled

1494
01:31:57.281 --> 01:32:01.780
down a flight of fucking unforgiving.
All right.
Uh,
yeah,

1495
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:06.510
I'd have to go with you on that one.
Um,
yeah,
those guys are,

1496
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:09.850
they're the fucking worst.
I love that.
You said that to him too.
Well,
you know,

1497
01:32:09.851 --> 01:32:11.080
we all got to grow up sometime.

1498
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:17.230
I wasn't put on this year to be a slave marriage.

1499
01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.470
What are you a fucking king?

1500
01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.000
You just going to sit around and have other people bring wealth to.
Yeah,
I dunno.

1501
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:27.430
I got no comeback for him.
I'm fucking exhausted.

1502
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:31.390
I'm going to wrap this up then I shut it off again.
No,
I did not know.
All right.

1503
01:32:31.391 --> 01:32:32.890
Let's wrap it up with a little overrated,

1504
01:32:32.891 --> 01:32:36.580
underrated and some youtube videos for the week.
Um,

1505
01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:42.460
overrated.
Uh,
popular rap and hip hop music since 1994.

1506
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:47.320
Um,
if a six month old song is considered dated and dead,

1507
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:48.880
then it wasn't good to begin with.

1508
01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:53.170
No one listens to Zhao rule or Nelly or 50 cent anymore.

1509
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:57.160
Just like no one will listen to Kanye West or little Wayne in five years.

1510
01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:01.330
If music we're a food than modern mainstream rap would be Mcdonald's.

1511
01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.860
It's on every corner.

1512
01:33:02.861 --> 01:33:07.060
Easy to put together and it gives grownups horrible diarrhea.

1513
01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:11.530
All right.
I don't know much about hip hop,
but you don't think little Wayne

1514
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:17.860
50 cent?
No.
Uh,
since 1994.

1515
01:33:17.861 --> 01:33:19.840
What about Biggie?
Didn't like any of this shit.

1516
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:24.910
There's a couple of guys I know wasn't Nas illmatic wasn't that around then?

1517
01:33:25.121 --> 01:33:28.030
I don't know about that album,
but everybody says that album's unbelievable.

1518
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:33.310
I know what you're saying though.
All these auto tune fucking songs out there.

1519
01:33:33.311 --> 01:33:34.990
I get it.
I get it.
All right.
Underrated.

1520
01:33:34.991 --> 01:33:39.050
Not going out every weekend and spending $100 at a bar or a club.
Yeah,

1521
01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:42.820
I'm 21 and I'm supposed to get out there and have fun,
meet New People and Shit.

1522
01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:43.991
But like you said,

1523
01:33:43.991 --> 01:33:46.900
it's hard to meet girls when it sounds like you've got a bass drum chilling in

1524
01:33:46.901 --> 01:33:51.520
your ear.
Just nod.
Just not in a way it's some broad,
you know,
you won't sleep,

1525
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:55.150
you know,
won't sleep.
What?

1526
01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.240
Just nodding away at some broad,
you know,

1527
01:33:58.241 --> 01:34:01.210
you won't sleep with and you're just hoping to,

1528
01:34:01.211 --> 01:34:05.350
God she didn't just ask you a question that requires an answer.

1529
01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.281
Call me lame.

1530
01:34:06.281 --> 01:34:09.670
But I'd rather hang out on a porch on a nice night with some good friends,

1531
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:14.500
sweet girls,
just fucking drinking a good beer.
You write a country song here,

1532
01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.490
hanging out on the front porch.
We some good friends in sweet girls drink.

1533
01:34:20.491 --> 01:34:25.491
It's an fucking good bear with the game on me and a good conversation and rock

1534
01:34:27.221 --> 01:34:30.550
and roll in a CD player.
I'm not writing these lyrics.

1535
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:35.980
Maybe you won't wake up with a hole in your pocket.
Bleed nears.

1536
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:41.470
Let's do it for America.
Keep it up,
motherfucker.
Yeah.

1537
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:44.740
All right.
Youtube videos.
Yeah,
I hear what you're saying dude.
Yeah.
Chill at home.

1538
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:47.320
Fucking trying to bang the girl next door.
There you go.
Save you money.

1539
01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:52.290
And with that I am with that.
I got a a underrated,

1540
01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:52.810
uh,

1541
01:34:52.810 --> 01:34:57.320
not having a bunch of dumb dumb whores with their tits and ass is hanging out,

1542
01:34:57.321 --> 01:34:59.420
run out on a football field during halftime.

1543
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:03.380
I want the old fucking school bands to come back out again.
Did you see that?

1544
01:35:03.381 --> 01:35:04.214
A horse shit tonight.

1545
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:09.050
You know Kelly Rowland up in the stands said,
oh,

1546
01:35:09.051 --> 01:35:13.220
it was the girl from Destiny's child.
We have ASVAB is that

1547
01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.080
gives a fuck.
Who gives up?
Then she's up in the stand,

1548
01:35:21.081 --> 01:35:25.820
like the desperately trying to make music without a band.
Interesting.

1549
01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.410
I'm sick of it.
I want musicians to come back,
you know,

1550
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:34.830
and I want him to play in musical fucking,
uh,

1551
01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.840
atmospheres.
I don't want to see you a fucking football game.

1552
01:35:38.841 --> 01:35:43.190
Get a goddamn hundred men marching band to come out there.
Right?

1553
01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:49.610
Just play the old school songs.
But I am ADAP bap,
bap Bam and Amsterdam.

1554
01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.220
Bam,
Bam,
Bam and eminent.
Yeah,
but that's shit.

1555
01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:56.600
You fucking coming out there with you God damn shit.
Talking about breast cancer.

1556
01:35:56.601 --> 01:35:58.070
I understand.
I know.
It's a problem.

1557
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:03.560
You didn't write your fucking song for breast cancer.

1558
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:08.570
You try to use breast cancer now to,
to,
to sell some more fucking cds.

1559
01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:12.980
Huh?
Because that other one with the awful voice is selling more than you.

1560
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:13.850
Is that what you're doing?

1561
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:21.140
How is that less offensive than Janet Jackson's titty coming out as fucking

1562
01:36:21.141 --> 01:36:23.660
beyond me.
Tell you that right now?

1563
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:28.690
You know all those fucking horse walking around with their fucking asses and

1564
01:36:29.241 --> 01:36:33.830
titties hanging out.
You know,
why don't you fucking get a God damn job.

1565
01:36:33.831 --> 01:36:36.650
You dumb whores,
Jesus.
Fuck.

1566
01:36:36.651 --> 01:36:39.950
What would you be doing if he didn't have half your goods hanging out of your

1567
01:36:39.951 --> 01:36:44.600
fucking shorts?
You know?
Do you have any fucking talent whatsoever?

1568
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:48.560
You could do a split.
Great,
fantastic.

1569
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:52.240
Does that mean you got to put on some cowboy boots and get stuck to the goddamn

1570
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:56.120
astro turf in front of 80,000 fucking people on Monday night football?

1571
01:36:56.121 --> 01:36:58.820
I don't think it does.
I don't think it means that at all.

1572
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:04.910
I think that's,
that's a sign that you suck as a musician.

1573
01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:07.850
If you sing at halftime at a football game,

1574
01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:11.840
that pretty much means either you suck,
your music sucks,

1575
01:37:11.841 --> 01:37:16.760
or you've completely sold out as a god damned musician.
All right,

1576
01:37:16.761 --> 01:37:19.130
and that goes to those fucking concert.
Play the Superbowl too.

1577
01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:24.131
I don't give a shit fucking Bruce Springsteen screaming about dip and then

1578
01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:28.940
sliding around on his fucking knees like he's not 60 Jesus Christ.

1579
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.970
He got some good plastic surgery,
right?

1580
01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:38.080
That guy was like 35455550640 one he's 41 again,

1581
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:41.880
I don't know how the fuck he did it.
He got his face.

1582
01:37:41.881 --> 01:37:45.410
He yanked back and it actually looks good.
You know why?

1583
01:37:45.411 --> 01:37:49.520
Cause they practiced on all those real housewives of fucking New Jersey in

1584
01:37:49.521 --> 01:37:51.590
Orange County and all that shit.
That's what they did.

1585
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:56.310
They practiced on their faces and they went,
oh,
let's not do that again.

1586
01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:01.410
All right,
let's scratch that technique of the list.
Let's,
let's try this.

1587
01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.130
Oh,
that's a little bit better.
She only looks like half a lizard.

1588
01:38:07.110 --> 01:38:11.370
That's what you got to do.
Like I said,
it's like fucking hair plugs,

1589
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:15.960
hair plugs in the goddamn nineties looked horrific.
And now I've got to tell you,

1590
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:18.600
these guys swimming around in the pools,
you know,

1591
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:22.680
aside from the psychotic look in their eye,
like,
do I look okay?

1592
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.880
Other than that they're their hairline.
I mean,
I can't tell.
All right.

1593
01:38:26.881 --> 01:38:31.230
Youtube videos for the week.
I was talking about those free videos,

1594
01:38:31.231 --> 01:38:35.640
free climbers or jumpers or whatever the fuck it was.
Free runners.

1595
01:38:36.570 --> 01:38:39.990
I wanted to see a chase scene and somebody said a,
here's a video district,

1596
01:38:39.991 --> 01:38:44.610
be 13 chasing.
Um,
I have,

1597
01:38:44.611 --> 01:38:47.880
these are actually,
I have more,
these are just weird videos this week.

1598
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:52.710
Okay.
That's actually a cool one.
Here's a weird one,

1599
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:56.190
a proper possum,
pedicure,

1600
01:38:57.510 --> 01:39:02.280
search that,
um,
and then this is one,
I swear to God,

1601
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:05.160
I didn't even think it was real,
but look up,

1602
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.760
look up sweet home Alabama and there's some lady singing it.

1603
01:39:12.481 --> 01:39:17.160
Just scroll down past all the Leonard Skinner and just look for the fat woman

1604
01:39:17.161 --> 01:39:20.250
with one tooth.
And uh,

1605
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:25.260
for some reason I don't think that she realized that it got a million and a half

1606
01:39:25.261 --> 01:39:29.340
hits.
Um,
and here's another one.

1607
01:39:29.341 --> 01:39:32.910
Look up fake rapture prank.
This is all one word,

1608
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.920
fake rapture.
Our AP,
t,U r e prank,
all one word.

1609
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:40.800
It's basically,
do you guys know what the rapture is?

1610
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:43.650
Oji Do you know what that is?

1611
01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:49.560
That's basically when Jesus,
right before Jesus comes back.
Now,

1612
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:52.680
correct me if I'm wrong,
people in Florida,

1613
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:58.680
um,
I guess right before he comes back,

1614
01:39:58.770 --> 01:40:01.080
like people who are going to come to go to heaven,

1615
01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:05.160
like they're going to be sitting across from you,
like fucking absent.

1616
01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:08.750
Mindedly like picking their nose,
thinking about,
you know,

1617
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:10.230
what they're going to do that evening,

1618
01:40:10.231 --> 01:40:12.780
and then all of a sudden they're just not going to be there,

1619
01:40:12.781 --> 01:40:17.670
but their clothes will be there because evidently you have to be naked to go to

1620
01:40:17.671 --> 01:40:21.990
heaven,
right?
So your clothes are going to be there just left behind.

1621
01:40:21.991 --> 01:40:26.850
And then everybody who's not going to happen gets left behind.

1622
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:31.710
And then,
uh,
the whole world turns into like the,

1623
01:40:31.711 --> 01:40:36.090
that island on survivor where I think there's only one person's gonna win.

1624
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.300
I don't know what you can try to do to redeem yourself,

1625
01:40:39.301 --> 01:40:44.301
but basically Jesus is coming back and this time he's not asking any questions.

1626
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:46.500
There'll be no miracles,

1627
01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:51.000
no fucking seven o'clock show where he does the fish trick with the basket.

1628
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:53.620
No walking on water,
none of horseshit.

1629
01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:57.910
He's coming back like fucking Paul Kersey.
Right?

1630
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:00.970
Is that the name was that fucker Charles Bronson's name and the death wish

1631
01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:04.720
movies.
He's coming back to fucking kick the shit out of all the centers,

1632
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:09.430
make it was coming back to slap me around a little bit and then throw me into

1633
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:12.160
the fiery pits of hell.
So,
uh,

1634
01:41:12.161 --> 01:41:15.970
they found this Jesus Freak girl and these Jesus Freak people thought it would

1635
01:41:15.971 --> 01:41:20.680
be funny to fake the rapture and make this fucking Jesus freak chick think that

1636
01:41:20.681 --> 01:41:23.380
she got left behind.
And,
uh,

1637
01:41:23.381 --> 01:41:28.381
the fact that this girl is an adult and it gets this freaked out is really the

1638
01:41:29.441 --> 01:41:32.380
sad state of,
uh,

1639
01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:37.270
of what organized religion does to somebody that somebody this old could,

1640
01:41:37.271 --> 01:41:41.770
could get freaked out by something like this is fucking beyond me.
And,
um,

1641
01:41:43.210 --> 01:41:47.410
it's tragic.
I would speak to that.
Somebody,
I can't find where it was.

1642
01:41:47.411 --> 01:41:51.760
Somebody wanted me to ask me about that story where those college kids,

1643
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:53.680
uh,

1644
01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.680
these college kids taped this other kid either having sex or fooling around this

1645
01:42:00.851 --> 01:42:04.510
other college kid and it turned out he was with another dude.

1646
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:10.290
So then the kid was so humiliated because I guess he wasn't out that he went to

1647
01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:14.890
the George Washington bridge and killed himself.
And,

1648
01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:19.390
uh,
I guess somebody wanted me to comment on that.
That's obviously a,

1649
01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:23.620
yeah,
that's one of those fucking things where it's like,

1650
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:29.500
even though they're adults,
they're still kids.
And,
uh,

1651
01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:34.420
I don't think that they,
I don't think that people understand even at that age.

1652
01:42:34.421 --> 01:42:38.710
I just don't think that a lot of people understand the ramifications of what

1653
01:42:38.711 --> 01:42:41.710
they're doing sometimes.
Like how,
first of all,

1654
01:42:41.711 --> 01:42:46.711
how fucked up it is to just film somebody the invasion of privacy that that is.

1655
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:51.340
And then when you discovered this about this person,

1656
01:42:51.341 --> 01:42:55.150
just the level of humiliation that I don't know why you would do that to

1657
01:42:55.151 --> 01:42:58.180
somebody.
Uh,
but

1658
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:04.690
so for an unprecedented third time,
the fucking batteries die.

1659
01:43:04.691 --> 01:43:09.040
I got a bootleg bag,
a fucking thing,

1660
01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:13.780
a Duracell's here.
So let me wrap it up here.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
as a,

1661
01:43:13.781 --> 01:43:16.810
as a fucking free thinking adult,
I would never,

1662
01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:22.480
I would never do something like that to somebody,
but that age,
you know what?

1663
01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:26.740
I had the courage to be like,
guys,
this is fucking wrong.
Don't do that.
Like,

1664
01:43:26.741 --> 01:43:29.620
I don't think I would have to be on,
I hate to say that about myself,

1665
01:43:29.621 --> 01:43:33.670
but I wasn't a strong individual back then as I think a lot of people aren't at

1666
01:43:33.671 --> 01:43:37.780
that age,
which is tragically how something like that unfolds.

1667
01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:40.660
But what's going to be fucked up as the amount of people getting on their high

1668
01:43:40.661 --> 01:43:41.494
horse,

1669
01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:47.110
forgetting what you like at that age and how so much of it is trying to keep the

1670
01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:53.300
uh,
humiliation off of you.

1671
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:58.100
It's a lot of humiliation and your teen years actually it's your childhood right

1672
01:43:58.101 --> 01:44:02.000
up through those years.
So you finally just accept who the fuck you are,

1673
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:05.180
which is what that kid never got to a chance to do,

1674
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.140
which is really sad thing and then freak the fuck out.

1675
01:44:09.141 --> 01:44:12.440
And it made a really bad decision.
So,
yeah,

1676
01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:17.120
it's a fucking tragic story obviously,
but,
well,
I don't like how people,

1677
01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:21.170
once they are an adult and a comfortable in their own fucking skin and who they

1678
01:44:21.171 --> 01:44:21.680
are,

1679
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.040
we'll then turn around and they're going to start yelling at these fucking kids

1680
01:44:25.041 --> 01:44:29.000
like,
uh,
like they,
they would have been,
you know,

1681
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:33.170
strong enough to go against the,
uh,
the mob,
you know,

1682
01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:38.300
it's fucked up.
All right.
You're dealing with kids who are technically adults,

1683
01:44:38.301 --> 01:44:40.880
but mentally they don't understand,

1684
01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:46.880
you know,
what are they thinking?
Oh,
this is going to be funny,
you know,

1685
01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:48.790
and then,
uh,

1686
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:52.430
we'll have the most hits on our fucking youtube page and then maybe everyone

1687
01:44:52.431 --> 01:44:55.580
will come to our house party and then we'll get laid,
right?
I mean,

1688
01:44:55.581 --> 01:45:00.560
do they really think anywhere beyond that?
You don't really think that,
okay,

1689
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:04.760
this is a fucking huge secret.
We just unraveled on this kid.

1690
01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:10.250
His kid has family.
This kid has friends.
Let's get as a life.

1691
01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:15.500
You don't think that Shit,
you just,
I dunno.
It's that residual.

1692
01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:20.060
A
fucking playground.
Shit.
So I don't know,
man.

1693
01:45:20.110 --> 01:45:23.120
I know it's a fucking off.
What the fuck did I bring?

1694
01:45:23.121 --> 01:45:27.710
That story up in the end was already a fucking brutal enough week.

1695
01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:32.990
Um,
I don't know why the fuck did I go that route?

1696
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.710
All right,
let's,
let's fucking get off that subject.
Um,
all right,

1697
01:45:36.711 --> 01:45:39.530
that's the podcast this week.
My Yard DVD,

1698
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.370
my DVD comes out,
um,

1699
01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:49.730
comes out tomorrow,
Tuesday the fifth in stores,

1700
01:45:49.731 --> 01:45:54.350
whatever stores still sell it and it makes a great stocking stuffer as I said,

1701
01:45:54.351 --> 01:45:57.680
for someone that you have to buy a gift for but don't particularly like,

1702
01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:59.060
or if somebody you do like,

1703
01:45:59.061 --> 01:46:02.750
and I gotta tell you this is really totally different than the special that you

1704
01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:04.430
saw on TV if you've already seen it.

1705
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:09.190
They really took out two huge bits and then I had other bits that,
uh,

1706
01:46:09.230 --> 01:46:13.790
we just have on there as extras and a,
I would really appreciate it if you'd be,

1707
01:46:13.791 --> 01:46:17.990
if you check it out,
if you buy it,
that would be a,
that would be awesome.

1708
01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:21.680
And uh,
and that's it.
That's the podcast for this week.
Once again,

1709
01:46:21.681 --> 01:46:25.670
thanks to everybody who came out to see me at the egg and Albany and everybody

1710
01:46:25.671 --> 01:46:30.620
who came out to see me out in Buffalo.
And uh,
that is it.

1711
01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:34.460
Everybody have a good week and a,
yeah,

1712
01:46:34.461 --> 01:46:38.120
don't be fucking videotape and people trying to humiliate a,
all right.

1713
01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:41.780
And if you were the jealousy where we got this week and don't fucking wear the

1714
01:46:41.781 --> 01:46:46.781
Jersey or the hat of a team that kicks the shit out of another team and going to

1715
01:46:47.211 --> 01:46:50.520
their Goddamn stadium and expect that you're going to be treated even remotely

1716
01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:55.080
human.
Okay.
All right,
ed.
Uh,
and that's it.

1717
01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:59.920
That's fucking it.
How'd you like Dad fucking jets fans?

1718
01:46:59.921 --> 01:47:04.830
Will fucking patriots are slowly coming back together.
I still don't,
I don't,

1719
01:47:04.831 --> 01:47:07.180
I still don't believe yet.
I still don't fucking believe yet.

1720
01:47:07.181 --> 01:47:09.670
It's still think that Jetson going on when the God damn division,
as much as,

1721
01:47:09.671 --> 01:47:14.320
I hate to say it,
but,
uh,
I still,
I think of Ben comes back there.
My Hope,

1722
01:47:14.650 --> 01:47:16.180
because I think the colts are reeling.

1723
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:18.550
I'm hope this is how much I fucking hate the jets.

1724
01:47:18.551 --> 01:47:21.510
I'm actually going to root for the fucking stealers,
those currency,

1725
01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:25.650
while he's talking about bill Bellacheck filming the other team and completely

1726
01:47:25.651 --> 01:47:30.330
ignore that the super Steelers of the 70s were fucking roided out of their

1727
01:47:30.331 --> 01:47:34.260
minds,
out of their fucking minds.
You don't believe me?

1728
01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.660
Go ask Fran Tarkington.
All right.

1729
01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:40.100
<v 6>That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you next week.</v>
