1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.030
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:06.780
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:11.781
April 30 40 50 60 April 16th,

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.810
2012 2012.
What's this decade call,
by the way,
you know,

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.700
last decade was called the two thousands of the twos or the arts.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.060
What was it called?
The turn of the century?
Um,

7
00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:29.070
this one's called the teens.
Even think about that shit.

8
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.270
It was the roaring twenties.
It was the holy Shit.
Thirties and a,

9
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.590
let's go get that fucking half a mustache.
Cunt forties.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.260
The shifty fifties there.
Hey man,
sixties.
Right?

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.090
Oh,
gives a fuck.
It's,
um,
why am I yelling?

12
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.820
You know why?
Cause I have no energy.

13
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.060
So I figured I could just start screaming and I could overcome my lack of

14
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:58.680
fucking enthusiasm here.
Well,
you know what,
I've got to tell you something.

15
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:03.360
At 58,
59,
Bang,
there's one minute,
one minute down,
59 to go.

16
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.943
Um,

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.760
it's Sunday night here in Los Angeles and I'm leaning on a piano singing a song.

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.340
There's a divorced man at the bar.

19
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.440
Maybe he never got married.
He stares into his drink.

20
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:27.240
Thinking about what would have been holy fuck,
it's me.

21
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.790
Sorry,
I just sang a twilight zone episode.
Um,
all right,

22
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.650
what the fuck am I doing it?
You know,
so you don't got this.

23
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.400
I got this new fancy fucking laptop,
you know,

24
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.330
and they got the stupid fucking password thing on this thing.
I,
first of all,

25
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:47.040
I bought a Goddamn Mac knowing full well that the person who finished assembling

26
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:50.970
this probably through themselves out the window to kill themselves,

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.310
only to be stopped by those.
Don't kill yourself.

28
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.250
Nets flung back through the window,

29
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.030
landing back at his station to then listen to soothing.

30
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.920
Don't kill yourself music.
All right?

31
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:05.580
So I spend all this money on this laptop that some fucking eight year old put

32
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:10.440
together at four in the morning,
you know,
while being beaten with a,

33
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.430
the last thing he assembled and uh,
they got this fucking password on here.

34
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.930
I swear to God,
if I walk away from the computer for fucking five seconds,

35
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.770
I got to type it in again.
So I know what you guys are saying.

36
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.720
I know what you're thinking.
You go on bill.
Bill.

37
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.560
Why don't you just go to that part of the fucking computer and maybe push it

38
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.090
back to like five minutes?
Well,

39
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:32.070
I'll tell you why because I can't fucking find it.

40
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.470
That's why I can't find it.
The sinks.

41
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:38.690
You come with a book or do we have to go buy a book?

42
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.510
<v 1>I Dunno.
I hate these fucking things.</v>

44
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.450
I hate these God damn things and I have to be up tomorrow morning,
everybody.

45
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:49.451
Tomorrow morning I have to be at work six 20 in the morning.

46
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.670
You understand me?
I have a job tomorrow.
Just like you guys,

47
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.590
you're probably already at your job,
aren't you?

48
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.480
Swollen eyes from a weekend.
A boozing,
you know,

49
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.480
trying to forget that you had to come to that cubicle.
They can,

50
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.770
if you drank enough of them,

51
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:10.240
maybe the thought of it would go away and there you are sitting there,
you know?

52
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.370
<v 1>Looking at all three sides of your cubicle.
Well,
I gotta tell you some,</v>

54
00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:17.100
when you spin yourself around your little plastic stapled chair,

55
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.020
you see that the fourth wall,
you could walk right through that.

56
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.070
You walked into it.

57
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.870
Why don't we have a walk out of your cubicle day one of these days?
You know,

58
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.990
I want to start an occupy.
Um,
I dunno.

59
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.340
What about an unoccupied you're fucking cubicle day,

60
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.660
you know,
gimme a fucking office or don't get me an office.

61
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.280
I'll just sit at a desk like fucking Jack Lemmon at the beginning of the

62
00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:48.120
apartment.
You ever see that movie?
It's great fucking movie.
But if you watch it,

63
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:50.880
they're all just sitting in this whole line at desks in a shooting.
The Shit.

64
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.880
Everybody's flirt with each other.
They fuck after work.

65
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:57.450
They drank and they all do it.
And Jack Lemon's apartment,
you know.

66
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.790
Evidently that was,
that was too much fun.

67
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.740
<v 2>Okay.</v>

68
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.440
<v 1>There was a way we could somehow fall,
can</v>

69
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.350
have them sitting near one another yet.
Not being able to see one another.

70
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.750
Maybe then we could be a little more fishing.
Yeah.
Um,

71
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.020
all right.
This is the podcast.
Uh,

72
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.310
I have to jump right in and once somebody just wrote,
hockey is like soccer bill.

73
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:27.540
How can you hate on soccer and love hockey?
So much de fuck.

74
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.370
They are so similar.

75
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.010
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.540
<v 1>Yeah.
Except one is played by men.</v>

77
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:36.660
The others played by girls who anytime you brush up against them,
they go,
oh,

78
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.210
they roll around in the ground for fucking 20 minutes.
You know wells does that.

79
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:47.450
And the NHL,
European soccer,
I fucking hockey players.

80
00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.330
The fucking sweet,
right?
The Norwegians,
I don't know if there's any weekends.

81
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.920
I Dunno.
All those fucking the city San Dean's,

82
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:59.930
however you saying the fucking twins up there.
Jesus Christ,
even graze,

83
00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:04.550
they're fucking Ben Affleck.
Goatees from 1996 they flop around on the ice.

84
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.360
I like soccer.
I think it is very similar to hockey.

85
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:11.640
I just can't get over the fucking,

86
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.450
what does it say about the many your country that they pretend to be hurt,

87
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.350
roll around.

88
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.760
So some guy will take a little yellow fucking card out of his back pocket and

89
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:25.450
run up to the person who allegedly did it and just fucking,
you know,

90
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.380
pull it out like some sort of,
I dunno,
FBI badge.

91
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.920
I hate all the ref runs up to the guy who does it.
And Jake,

92
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.420
there's the yellow card.
What does it,
we just slap it out of his fucking hand.

93
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.910
This is the one I'll start watching sock.
You know what to think of.

94
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.050
I feel about soccer.

95
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.280
I feel like the people in the stands are tougher than the people in the field.

96
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.160
It's,
it's really bizarre.
You know,

97
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.380
I would go out on the pitch in a second,

98
00:05:51.381 --> 00:05:56.180
my little fucking Larry Bird short shorts and I'd run around there and brush up

99
00:05:56.181 --> 00:06:01.181
against fellow and watching go fucking fall on the grass and rolled around

100
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:05.480
hugging their knee that I didn't hit.
I would do that a second.

101
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.470
As far as standing in the crowd with those fucking crooked teeth,

102
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.650
sons of bitches with a couple of pints and some fish and chips in them.

103
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.150
Fuck that.
I'd never do it.

104
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.770
Having choke me to death with their fucking matching scarves.
I don't need that.

105
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.880
All right.
I'm gonna tell you,
the Premiere League is,
is phenomenal.

106
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.810
World Cup soccer.
I love it.
I love it.
Except for the,

107
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.830
every time I start to get into it,
there's that,
that just that shameless

108
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.180
flopping around,
flopping around and they all look like they're going to cry.

109
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.550
The Spaniards and the Italians,

110
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:42.940
they actually get their eyes all welled up like fucking Meryl Streep.

111
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.130
They're out there trying to win an award.
That's what I would do.
You know,
if I,

112
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.500
if I was making films in England,
that's what I would do right there.

113
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.790
I would fuck in a,

114
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.670
<v 0>yeah,</v>

115
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.320
<v 1>you know,
I cast just a soccer player.
Those guys can cry on cue.</v>

116
00:06:58.321 --> 00:07:02.190
I you to do is run by him.
Um,
so anyways,
so now of course he goes,

117
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:04.830
the condescending thing.
I don't know if this guy's actually,

118
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.170
cause he's actually saying that he's into the Blackhawks.
He's like,

119
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.790
Americans don't have the attention span to watch the game that the rest of the

120
00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:14.580
world plays.
You know,
I love that.

121
00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:17.790
I love how they just can't admit that we don't give a fuck because we,
we,

122
00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:20.310
we like contact sports.
That's what we like.

123
00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:22.320
We like people smashing into one another.

124
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.440
That's what we like and getting brain damage.

125
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.210
And then bitching about it years later,

126
00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:30.300
even though they did it on purpose because the fucking assistant coach gave him

127
00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:34.380
1000 bucks to do it.
Those are the kinds of games that we like.
All right.

128
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.400
We're ignorant and were violent,
but we do have an attention span.

129
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.800
All right,
I understand.
It's beautiful game.
It's phenomenal.

130
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.130
The corner kicks flying up and over everybody grabbing their balls on the

131
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:48.950
penalty shots.
It's beautiful.
It's a beautiful thing to watch.

132
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:53.951
10 guys standing in a line cupping that junk yet giving up their face to block

133
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:59.390
this ball.
You know?
And as always,
they always say they,
what do they call it?

134
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.280
What Ball?
They should call it handball cause they carry it in their hands.

135
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.380
You know,
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.
Okay.

136
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.400
Like I said,
I totally respect the game.
I think it's a beautiful game.

137
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:18.090
But when you guys get rid of the flopping around and,

138
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:22.400
and borderline crying in that game,
uh,
I'm all over it.

139
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.900
I'm all over it.
All right?
But don't talk to me about fucking attention span.

140
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.850
It's fucking boring.

141
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.500
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.860
<v 1>All right.
It's not boring.
It's just,
it's just fucking,
it's the flop.
But for me,</v>

143
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.480
I'm speaking for everybody.
I'm speaking for me.

144
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.310
I can't get over the flopping around.
I like the premier league.

145
00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:45.330
I like listening to everybody's singing the songs,
the excitement of the crowd.

146
00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:48.870
He can feel it.
It matters.
There's history.
I could totally get into it,

147
00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:53.220
but every time I start to get on the edge of my seat,
somebody fucking starts.

148
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.050
I Dunno what,
grabbing their anus,
ed,
uh,
you know,

149
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.120
flipping around and then that Douche runs up and fucking stomps his foot as he

150
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:07.400
pulls out the car.
I'm,
I'm just not into it.
All right.
You know,

151
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.340
I like when people do that.

152
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.440
Like they just can't accept that you don't like their sport.

153
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.990
Like I tweeted something.
Yes,

154
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:15.860
I did do that and somehow maintain my heterosexuality.

155
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.990
I tweeted something and um,

156
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.790
I said that you could watch lord of the rings and the time it takes to watch the

157
00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:28.840
final 58 seconds of a close NBA game.

158
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.903
<v 0>Right.</v>

159
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.580
<v 1>The NBA,
I don't ever remember it taking that fucking long.
When I was younger,</v>

160
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.490
I used to watch hoop,
but you know,
just like a baseball game,

161
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:42.600
baseball games didn't take as long as it wasn't everybody doing a fucking triple

162
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:45.970
Lindy yet between every single fucking pitch,
stepping outside the batter bar,

163
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.960
grabbing your deck,
Justin,
your gloves and all that boring horse shit.

164
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.290
I put that right up there with soccer.
All right.

165
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.720
Fucking basketball's the same thing.
So I ended up,

166
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:59.010
I ended up making fun of that Shit.
And somebody writes back,
um,

167
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.890
the fuck did they write something on the effect that,
you know,

168
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.570
we always make fun of that,
which we don't understand.
You know,

169
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.110
kind of like what you're doing saying that you're not admitting that soccer does

170
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.280
is kind of fucking boring.

171
00:10:12.281 --> 00:10:15.700
You just going to say we don't have the attention span for it,
you know?

172
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.030
Yet somehow we can sit there and watch the nine innings,
a boring baseball.

173
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.310
Plenty of Americans do that,
sir.
All right.
You hear that?
Hear that sounds,
sir.

174
00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:27.490
That's the sound of your argument.
Hitting the fucking water in the shitter.

175
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.500
All right.
And this other cunts,
they're talking about how,
you know,

176
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.900
I'll make it fun of basketball,
like I don't understand it.

177
00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:38.800
I totally understand it.
I've been watching it for 30 fucking years,
right?

178
00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:43.801
Youngster then watching it says 1981 okay.

179
00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:44.980
And I just a,

180
00:10:44.981 --> 00:10:47.800
I don't know if there's two things that may be stopped watching after the Jordan

181
00:10:47.801 --> 00:10:51.640
era.
Everyone who tried to be Jordan,
you know,

182
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.330
not passing the ball,
trying,
you know,
trying to win without a big man.

183
00:10:55.331 --> 00:10:58.270
I can do it all myself because Michael did it and then they took him like eight

184
00:10:58.271 --> 00:11:00.550
years to figure out they weren't Michael.
You know,

185
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.380
that type of shit is the only guy I've been able to see,
see,
do it.
That kind of,

186
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.620
I used to like the team aspect of it that kind of left.

187
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.980
And then at the end of the fucking game,
it's just like this 58 fucking,

188
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:12.910
you're the worst is,

189
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.170
is when the other team is clearly lost the fucking game and they keep calling

190
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.480
timeouts.
Ah,
Jesus Christ,
just,

191
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.280
it's over.
Fuck.
What do you think you'd try to cock block that?
The 20 delay.

192
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:31.020
There's celebration,
you know?
I Dunno.
So I mean,

193
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:34.110
I still like hoop.
You know,
I,
there's aspects of soccer that I like,

194
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.270
but I know there's something about basketball.

195
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:40.770
I don't understand why I watched this exciting,
fast paced fucking game.

196
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.780
And then right when it all matters,
you slowed the whole fucking thing down.

197
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:49.230
And I watched people take unguarded shots to win the game.

198
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.710
It becomes golf at that point.
There's nobody trying to stop you,
you know,

199
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.190
instead of putting it into the hole,
you'd get your fucking throwing it in,

200
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.580
sort of lobbing it in,
putting a nice pretty arch on it.
Unless your shack,

201
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.010
you know,
second you put your fucking hands over the Lva head,

202
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:07.380
you're above the rim.
Right.
So what do you do?
We started throwing in straight.

203
00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:10.660
Yes.
You know,
I think shacks.

204
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:13.910
The only person probably has a worst science background than I do.
You know?

205
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.930
Remember that shit when I was telling you,
I don't understand how planes fly.

206
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:18.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

207
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.780
<v 1>Right.
You can,
you can have a,
on a cruise ship,</v>

208
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.410
I can have a fucking pool on a cruise ship.
You know what I mean?

209
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.730
How do you dig a hole

210
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.590
into the end of the fuselage and dump water in it and it doesn't sink.

211
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:31.580
It's just fucking beyond me.

212
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.230
I'm the only person I would say as a worst science background than me would be

213
00:12:36.231 --> 00:12:40.100
shocked because he was in the League for almost 20 damn seasons and he never

214
00:12:40.101 --> 00:12:43.250
figured out that,
hey,
you know,
maybe I need to put an,
you know,

215
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.530
some sort of trajectory on this thing.
Is that the right word?

216
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.160
It's unreal.
I mean,
when I was a kid and I,
and,
and you know,
with the Nerf Hoop,

217
00:12:52.161 --> 00:12:53.480
I knew I needed to do that.

218
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.220
How can he be fucking nine feet tall and not understand that?

219
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.720
Stay in that fucking voice is cracking.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,

220
00:13:02.721 --> 00:13:06.560
I got to go to work tomorrow at six 20 in the fucking morning.
Nia needs the car.

221
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.280
So that means I gotta to take big boy drive her up the fucking driveway,

222
00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:13.010
make fucking neighbors are going to kill me.
But a quarter to six in the morning.

223
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.140
Yeah.
Gay,
Gay,
gay,
gay,
gay,
gay,
gay,
gay.
[inaudible]
well

224
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.940
my,
my,
my,
my,
my,
my,
my sound on my truck warming up.

225
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.440
Then it stalls.
It's meet pumping the gas,

226
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.770
you know,
Dan [inaudible]

227
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:39.420
and then I'm up the top of the fucking driveway.
You know,

228
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.700
they can look out the window with their noses all wrinkled up.

229
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:45.140
It's gonna be ugly.
It's going to be ugly,
but I got to use it.

230
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.801
I've got to tell you something.

231
00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:48.670
There's nothing better than to have a classic car on a fucking Sunday driving it

232
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:53.030
around out here in la.
You know?
Absolutely.
Love it,

233
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.050
love it.
And thanks to everybody,
show me where I could go buy some parts for it.

234
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.520
I ordered everything I need.

235
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.710
My side view mirrors coming in so I can stop looking over my right shoulder.

236
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.110
Um,
all right,
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Everybody.
Um,

237
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.760
welcome.
Welcome.
If you're new,

238
00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:14.120
I know I'm pookie Pam picking up like one or two listeners a week.

239
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.710
And that's big for me cause I like to grow things small and not that small and a

240
00:14:18.711 --> 00:14:23.540
very slow rate of speed.
All right.

241
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.740
I'm not trying to blow up,
you know,

242
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.860
like all these other people who are like,
like fucking motivated.

243
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.970
It's not my style.
I like where I'm at.
I'm satisfied.

244
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.140
Just like when I was in high school I wasn't doing well.

245
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.090
I wanted to get into a good college,

246
00:14:41.091 --> 00:14:44.030
but you know I started flunking classes and I was just like,

247
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:47.540
well you know what am I still eating every day?
You know?

248
00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:48.800
Do I have plenty of water?

249
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:50.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

250
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.160
<v 1>Their roof,
my head when it's raining</v>

251
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.993
<v 2>out,
I'm fine.</v>

252
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.170
Why do I need to pass these classes?

253
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.660
<v 1>You need two years of a way when it's your note college has got to look at Ya</v>

254
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.070
really lady with the really long dress.

255
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.570
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

256
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.600
<v 1>I'm still thinking of fucking,
yeah,
you might as well dressed like a whore,</v>

257
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.380
but that's another subject.
As far as your two years of a language,

258
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.570
I think as long as I have the money,
I can do it.

259
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.940
Anybody in high school listening to this fucking thing,

260
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:21.780
you don't need two years of a language to get.

261
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.800
What you need to do is either past two years of a,

262
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:28.400
of a language and get in that way.
And if you don't,

263
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:31.400
then all you do is you just go to a community college for a couple of years and

264
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:35.900
you prove that you can,
you can work at a college level,
right?

265
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.970
And then you just transfer it.

266
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.490
You fucking parachute in like the way Clemons joined the fucking 1999 world

267
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:47.390
champion New York Yankees.
He just jumped right in.
He parachuted right in,

268
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:49.130
right through the sunroof of,

269
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:53.600
of the limo that they took the previous year when they won the championship and

270
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:55.910
then he wanted,
that's how you do your college career.

271
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.220
Two years of a community college,

272
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.180
you can get a fucking paper route and pay for that God damn tuition,
right?

273
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.770
You save all that God damn money.

274
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.120
You would dumber girls so they're easier to bang.
They've got lower self esteem,

275
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.790
you know,
probably gonna swallow.
It's all in a brochure.

276
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.440
And then right when you got that you,

277
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.930
you think that you can't wash this stink of the community college audio.

278
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.060
You fucking,
you apply to a real school,

279
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:28.550
you apply to the school that you wanted to go to.
You go out,

280
00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:29.630
you get some fucking loans,

281
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:32.960
and then you're in there and they all in you and you fucking get the same degree

282
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.830
as Susie smart pants who fucking learn how to sorta speak a language in this

283
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:39.680
country that you don't need to speak in other one at all.
Right?

284
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.330
And then come graduation day,

285
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.690
you're sitting right next to her half fucking price.

286
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.390
Half price,
half off.

287
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

288
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.800
<v 1>Half off of Notre Dame fucking education.</v>

289
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.400
I'll tell you want to talk about a disappointment going to the Notre Dame

290
00:16:56.401 --> 00:17:00.180
fucking campus all those years when they showed the golden dome and Jesus

291
00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:04.050
standing there with his arms out like,
oh,
we gonna score here.
What?

292
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.303
Right.

293
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.640
Touchdown Jesus and all the beautiful trees and the beautiful ladies in the

294
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:14.760
autumn leaves and all that type of shit.
And you're like,
oh my God,

295
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:18.700
that's fucking gorgeous.
That's where I wanted to go to school.
You know,

296
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.270
I already looked like their mascot,
you know,
I figured I'd show up.

297
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.630
They'd be like,
oh my God.
It's him and I get laid,
you know,
be like,

298
00:17:24.631 --> 00:17:27.180
if you look like Elvis showed up at Graceland,

299
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.930
tell me somebody is not going to suck your dick if you got some sequence on the

300
00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:35.580
side of your slacks.
I mean,
these are just theories people.
So anyways,

301
00:17:35.581 --> 00:17:39.750
I finally went to the Notre Dame campus and it is absolutely beautiful,

302
00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:41.490
but the surrounding fucking area.

303
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.080
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

304
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.180
<v 1>good be summed up in one word.
Oh</v>

305
00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.270
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

306
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.510
you want to talk about a fucking reality show waiting to happen,

307
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.480
the surrounding area.

308
00:17:56.481 --> 00:18:00.620
Those are the people who were too dumb to go to be on some fucking fishing for

309
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:03.380
clams,
reality shelf.
You know what I mean?

310
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.200
It'll be the name of the reality show,
too dumb to be on a tugboat.

311
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.310
Whatever the fuck.
Next job.
They're going to show me the real tug boaters.

312
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.990
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

313
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.230
<v 1>Yeah.
Also,
there was a cruise liner coming in and out.</v>

314
00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:20.680
We didn't have enough tires in the side of the,
shut the fuck up.
You know,

315
00:18:20.681 --> 00:18:23.380
something,
I would actually,
you know,
if I had to be on a boat,

316
00:18:23.381 --> 00:18:28.360
if I had to work on a boat,
right?
Fight to get my little,
uh,
fight it,

317
00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:28.810
do it.

318
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.780
There's no fucking way I'd work on a cruise ship because I don't like people.

319
00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:33.483
<v 0>Okay.</v>

320
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.580
<v 1>And at the top of the list of people that I don't like our fat people
sunbathing.</v>

321
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.670
Okay,
you should have shame.
Put Your fucking shirt on.
Okay.

322
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.000
And if I've got to look at that and bring you a slice of cake at the same time,

323
00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.190
there's no way I'm not getting fired.

324
00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.720
So cruise ships around the navy,
I'm not joining the navy.

325
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.470
There's no fucking way of joining the navy unless I'm going to be a navy seal

326
00:18:57.471 --> 00:19:01.310
and I'm too much of a pussy to do that.
All right?
But I'm not joining the navy,

327
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.430
you know,
see the world or what do I see a bunch of fucking water,

328
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.653
<v 0>you know,</v>

329
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.760
<v 1>pull into port somewhere for fucking 20 minutes.
I don't want to do that shit.</v>

330
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.240
I don't know.
The Navy,
I always pictured them just singing songs.

331
00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:21.380
Mopping up the deck.

332
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:22.363
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

333
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.070
<v 1>Or you're in a fucking sub and that's even the worst.
You know what I mean?</v>

334
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:31.410
I think I'd rather go to prison to be in a fucking God damn sub under the water.

335
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.690
Right.
That's where the subs are,
aren't they bill?
It was,
it was.

336
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.420
Thank God you described where a sub is.

337
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.520
There's no fucking way.
There was no good God damn fucking way.

338
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:46.260
I could survive on the sub.

339
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.943
<v 0>You know,</v>

340
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.340
<v 1>those little doorways,
all those douchebags over.
What,</v>

341
00:19:54.341 --> 00:19:58.510
what can you do down there?
You know,

342
00:19:58.511 --> 00:20:00.730
there's fucking guys underneath there for six months.

343
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.470
I yet some point you just got to shoot off a torpedo just to do it right and it

344
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:12.250
fucking like whale shark or something and they endangered,
um,

345
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.420
the,
they still have periscopes on those things.

346
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.980
What the fuck am I talking?
So I couldn't do that job.
I wouldn't go,

347
00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:24.480
I don't want to go fishing because they saw a perfect storm and I read the book.

348
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.870
Um,
and that's my reality.

349
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.770
Fucking George Clooney ships going under.

350
00:20:32.771 --> 00:20:35.070
And he pushes himself back into it as if you're,

351
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.820
the human body has the ability to fucking override your brain going,

352
00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:42.940
I need some air.
Mark Wahlberg was out.

353
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.190
I look how they had that nice little moment where they were looking at,

354
00:20:45.191 --> 00:20:47.080
you ate each other and one of the worst storms

355
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.300
<v 4>underwater in the dark in salt water.
No mask on.</v>

356
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.210
They actually shared a moment,
you know?

357
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.533
<v 0>Okay.</v>

358
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.110
<v 1>I didn't want him talking to them.
Oh,
a tug boat.
I could work on a tugboat.</v>

359
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.530
You know,
you get one of those pea coats peacoats pea coats.

360
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

361
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.780
<v 1>And he starts singing song.
Oh she was half the fish.</v>

362
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.470
How do you find the vagina?
I can see your tits.
What's up with fucking mermaid?

363
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.380
That's why I'm understood about mermaids.
How do you get to the

364
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.460
<v 4>fucking Pootie?
You know titzer right there.</v>

365
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.580
That's all you can do with a fucking a mermaid.
You just get tit fucker,

366
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.333
<v 0>you know,</v>

367
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.340
<v 4>till they got dry.
Bill at the fucking dried out.</v>

368
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:37.300
Salt of the Saudi at Dick probably staying after a while,
you know,

369
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.620
and she's looking at you like,
you know,

370
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:42.580
I need to get back in the water cause I'm starting to dry out.
And you're like,

371
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:46.090
yeah,
I noticed.
And I noticed with the chafing of either side of the shaft,

372
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.750
this is one of the filthiest fucking podcast I've ever done.
And you know what,

373
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:52.390
I don't give a shit cause I have to be up in like fucking three hours.

374
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.170
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

375
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:58.790
<v 1>Um,
what are you doing tomorrow,
Bill,
that you have to be up?
Um,</v>

376
00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:00.530
I got jury duty,

377
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.340
<v 4>I got jury duty.
I don't have jury duty.
I do have jury duty.</v>

378
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.220
I fucking blew it off.
So the next time I get pulled over,

379
00:22:08.221 --> 00:22:11.670
I think old Billy boys going to jail,
you know,

380
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.290
kill two birds with one stone,

381
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.840
<v 0>you know?</v>

382
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.180
<v 4>Do they arrest you?
That's why,
you know?</v>

383
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:19.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

384
00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.340
<v 4>I haven't got a jury.
Duty is probably a stupid thing to admit right now,</v>

385
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:26.570
but I did and I was trying to go,
I just,
I'm busy.
I work for myself.

386
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.060
What am I supposed to do?
I have to go to Albuquerque this weekend.
What do,

387
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:32.150
what do you want from me?
You know,

388
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:36.380
there's 40 people in a strip mall that are depending on me to,

389
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.060
to go there and talk about my Dick.

390
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

391
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.470
<v 1>You know,
I would love to sit here and you know,
listen to you,</v>

392
00:22:45.471 --> 00:22:48.320
make your points and then listen to that guy,
make his boy.
I would,

393
00:22:48.321 --> 00:22:49.590
you know something I would,
um,

394
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.020
<v 4>when I get old,
I'm already old,
but when I get really old,
you know,</v>

395
00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.460
man,
I've just pushed everybody away in my life and it's just me and you know,

396
00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:04.480
a couple pairs of socks and you know,
some old man underwear,

397
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.000
you know the one that has like that MC hammer crutch.

398
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:09.910
So you can have your old man balls hanging down to your knees,
right.

399
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.910
Have a little sideways shuffle to the,
to the toilet,
you know,

400
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.480
balls and just sitting there and the water is the only thing I'll let you know.

401
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.770
You're still alive.
You know,

402
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.700
every morning when you're old balls hit that toilet water.
Um,

403
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.150
I think what I would do for entertainment is I would go,

404
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.970
I would just watch trials.
I've noticed that,
you know,

405
00:23:30.971 --> 00:23:33.670
anytime I ever went to court,
he was always old.

406
00:23:33.671 --> 00:23:36.100
People just sitting there like knitting and shit.
And it's like,

407
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.320
is that the grandmother I never knew I had.
And it's just like this,

408
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.730
this is this bitch just sitting here like watching me go to fucking,

409
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.370
you know,
one of my friends

410
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.900
<v 1>don't want to trial here and this is just like entertainment for you.</v>

411
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:53.150
And I used to think it was really a fucking asshole thing to do,

412
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:56.410
but I've got to admit
that could be fun.

413
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.630
You're not required to be there.

414
00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.780
I would go to the sickest fucking trials,
you know,
murder trials.

415
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.470
I would go to chow molested trials is no fun.
Actually no murder.

416
00:24:08.471 --> 00:24:12.310
Cause then they're going to go through it.
Now I will drug deal.

417
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.700
I go drug dealer,
auto theft.

418
00:24:15.701 --> 00:24:20.500
Shoplifters that's what I'd like to see some chick who fucking went in with his

419
00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:23.410
oversized person tried to steal a chandelier or something.

420
00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:25.720
I'd sit in on those things.
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm saying?

421
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.610
You guys want to hear a commercial.
Wouldn't that be neat?
What if I sing it this?

422
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:35.110
Oh Christ,
I got to fucking put my God damn password in.
Unbelievable.

423
00:24:35.111 --> 00:24:40.111
Can somebody please tell me where I go on this stupid fucking thing to change

424
00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:41.440
it.
Oh my God.

425
00:24:41.441 --> 00:24:46.441
You go into settings and then you hit the fucking apple key card.

426
00:24:46.871 --> 00:24:51.010
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,
where are we?

427
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.470
I fucking hate computers.
You know,

428
00:24:53.471 --> 00:24:56.080
I hit about computers and some of the dumbest people I know on the planet are

429
00:24:56.081 --> 00:25:00.790
really good at.
Um,
you know,
it's like golf was talking about that last week.

430
00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:03.600
The amount of people I know that suck it all real sports and then you,

431
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.700
they get out in the course.
They can hit it straight.
You know why?

432
00:25:06.701 --> 00:25:09.620
Because nobody's trying to stop.
Um,

433
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:16.700
all right,
here we go.
What do we got here?
stamps.com everybody attached copy.

434
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.050
Where the hell is it?
stamps.com everybody,
I've been talking about this for week.

435
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:26.051
This has been the runaway hit as far as advertising goes on my podcast.

436
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:28.370
Everybody's getting,
everybody's getting into this.

437
00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:32.210
Don't be the last person to still be going to the post office because you'll be

438
00:25:32.211 --> 00:25:35.390
like me,
I still have a fax machine.
Do you understand that people?

439
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.510
I still fax things.
I bought one in 1999.

440
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.660
It's a Panasonic and I stand by it a lane way.

441
00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.890
It has to be faxed and um,
anyways,
stamps.com all right,

442
00:25:48.891 --> 00:25:51.470
this is the deal.
All right?
We're all busy.

443
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.920
Even if you're an absolute loser,
you're busy nowadays.

444
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:59.921
If he noticed that I don't have it frigging day job and for some reason,

445
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.600
all God damn day I have stuff to do.

446
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.550
I don't have time to go to the post office one.

447
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.540
Well thanks to stats.com um,
this is a deal.

448
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:16.580
It's important to look professional to your clients.

449
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.180
You don't look unprofessional.
You want to look professional to your clients,

450
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:21.710
your customers and your partners.

451
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.720
You want to come off like you know what you're doing.
That's what this,

452
00:26:25.721 --> 00:26:26.720
same with this copy.

453
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.860
Placing regular stamps on your letters and packages that won't do the trick.

454
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.150
All right?
You can look like some eight year old,
you know,

455
00:26:34.151 --> 00:26:36.770
but you'll butterfly stamps or you're having a nice day stamps.

456
00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:41.120
You want professional,
professional looking,
metered stamps.
All right.

457
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.340
If you want to take your business to the next level or if you want to intimidate

458
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.790
<v 4>your grandmother when you send back her sweater or right,
take my advice.</v>

459
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:50.550
Use stamps.com instead,
this is the deal.

460
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:56.210
You can buy and print official US postage using your own computer or someone

461
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:59.820
else's if that generous.
But your own computer and your printer,

462
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.290
you print professional looking postage directly on to envelopes,
labels,

463
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.430
um,
even paper plus damn,
stop,
calm.
We'll give you a digital scale.

464
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.700
My personal favorite,
I love the scale.
You know what I mean?

465
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.230
I feel like I'm doing something illegal but I'm not,
you know,
it's safe.
Um,

466
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.890
the bit basically you can get exact postage for any letter or package the

467
00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:23.520
instant you need it.
And I can back that up cause I'm sending all my DVDs out of,

468
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:28.080
stick it on the little scale.
It prints it out.
I got my little visor.

469
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.290
It's phenomenal.
Um,
endorsement.
Here we go.
Part two.

485
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:33.750
I'm trying to search for something while I'm talking to you in front of

486
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:38.100
compliment you as I do on this.
All right.
Getting over a broad,
um,

487
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.640
when you got here,
28 minutes in our right,

488
00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:46.050
We're flying now getting over abroad.
How do he bill?
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right.

489
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:48.180
I broke up with my girlfriends seven months ago,

490
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.910
several months ago and I'm having trouble getting over her.

491
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.520
We broke up because I had to move for school.

492
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:58.670
I swore to myself I would stop contacting her because I was becoming psychotic

493
00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:00.810
and jealous and I did.

494
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.320
I'm still finding myself thinking about her all the time.

495
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.100
All of the girls in my new town are horrific monsters.

496
00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.830
They aren't white trash,
ugly cons.

497
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.280
They are super hot but brain dead and boring and way out of my league to how is

498
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:22.971
somebody brain dead and boring Outta your league or because they're super hot.

499
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.230
Just walk up to her.

500
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.310
What is she going to sell these aren't you going to do is say no.

501
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.580
Not saying she's going to say no.
Every time you guys listen,
listen,

502
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.010
let me tell you something.
Do you want to fucking beautiful girl?

503
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.140
Do you want to marry a fucking beautiful woman?
A Beautiful,

504
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.070
<v 1>smart woman?
Isn't that what every guy wants to do?
Well,</v>

505
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.760
you're not going to do what if you're too afraid to talk to him.
All right,

506
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.790
so why don't you practice on a brain dead?
Stupid one.

507
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.000
So some day when that girl walks in and takes your breath away,

508
00:29:56.001 --> 00:29:59.840
you're going to have the fucking balls over there to walk up,
you know?

509
00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.590
Say something witty while you got your head on a Glam.
No,
don't do that.

510
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.390
You don't do that.
Okay,
don't do that.
You know what I'm saying?
All right.
Anyways,

511
00:30:08.391 --> 00:30:12.590
my ex girlfriend was smart,
hot,
funny,
cool,

512
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:17.030
and was really into me.
I tried getting over by banging other chicks,

513
00:30:17.031 --> 00:30:18.050
but it doesn't work.

514
00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.340
It just leaves them brokenhearted and it makes me feel worse.
Well,
wait a minute.

515
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.160
How are they broken heart at after you just bagged them?

516
00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.700
That means you bang them for a couple of weeks and then tell them to fuck off.

517
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:33.710
Don't do that.
You.
You should just be,
you know,
stick and move.
All right.
Anyways,

518
00:30:33.711 --> 00:30:34.011
he says,

519
00:30:34.011 --> 00:30:39.011
I can't seem to find anyone that can measure up to my ex need more solutions.

520
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.180
All right,
well,
you know,

521
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.470
when you break up with somebody that you care about and they have all those good

522
00:30:45.471 --> 00:30:49.730
attributes,
it's going to be awhile before you meet another one.
All right?

523
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.163
So

524
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.840
<v 0>yeah,</v>

525
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.960
<v 1>you just got to go through it,
dude.
If you want,
if you want,</v>

526
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:57.700
if you don't want to get back together with the other girl,

527
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.090
<v 0>you know
then,</v>

528
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.160
<v 1>but you got to do is you get,
you get,</v>

529
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:06.280
you got to learn to be fucking single again.
You got to remember,

530
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:09.880
what did I do before I met that last girl?
What did I do?
Oh,
well,
let's see.

531
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:11.800
I had beers.
I fucking worked out.

532
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.630
I watched football or whatever the fuck you did.
I went to one of the,

533
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.630
went to the hunger games.

534
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:20.680
I read that trilogy of books or whatever the fuck that is,
you know,

535
00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.060
it hurts.
Okay.
Breaking up with somebody who's awesome,

536
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.500
but it's just not right or whatever.
It hurts.
So accepted.

537
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.110
All right platoon.
Take the pain.

538
00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.190
<v 0>You know?</v>

539
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.670
<v 1>Why don't you sit down and have a good cry?</v>

540
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:44.570
Just fucking cry it out of you every day.
Just wake up.

541
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.560
Think about it.
Let when you bottled lip starts quivering.
Don't stop it.

542
00:31:48.561 --> 00:31:52.130
Just give into it.
That's what kills guys.
We don't cry.
Just fucking cry.

543
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.930
Fucking cry puts your face in your pillow and cry like a little fucking girl.

544
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:02.410
I shouldn't have said girl.
Just fucking cry like a human being.

545
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.860
Why do we deny that emotion has meant?
Just let it out.
All right?

546
00:32:07.861 --> 00:32:12.480
Then wake up.
You know once you're done crying,
go in the bathroom,

547
00:32:12.481 --> 00:32:15.990
puts your face on it.
Go get yourself a bowl of fruit loops.

548
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.630
Just you know,
after you'd dumped her down,
I'm going to get through this.

549
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.630
Hype yourself up.
I have a good day today.

550
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.550
Go hit on some fucking hot brain.
Dead Boring.
Fucking broad.

551
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:33.740
It just as practice.
Just as practice.
Okay,
you're going to fund another one.

552
00:32:33.741 --> 00:32:36.560
You sound like you're still young.
It's not like you're 50

553
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.580
you and then at 50 swear to God.
If you're making money,

554
00:32:40.581 --> 00:32:44.220
you can probably still get like a hot 34 year old,
you know,

555
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.250
I wouldn't go into younger than that,
you know,

556
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.980
cause you've got to think by the time you're 60,
she's going to be 44.

557
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:51.710
She could still hang in there for that,
you know,

558
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.980
and all you gotta do is just keep fucking spinning around in the bedroom for

559
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:57.350
another five years and then she's too old to give a fuck.

560
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.260
And then you got her and she'll be patent pat,

561
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.440
you fucking rubbing your forehead as you're laying there and your deathbed,

562
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.650
you know,
telling you that you did did the right thing.

563
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.850
You go in a younger than that,
they have options and they'll leave you.
All right?

564
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.040
So getting overbroad,
that's what you gotta do.

565
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.800
You gotta cry it out of you and you just got accepted.

566
00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.450
It's going to hurt and he's,
it takes time.
Okay.
But,

567
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:25.220
uh,
you know,
don't run back to the other one.
Just cause you're lonely.
All right.

568
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:27.830
Cause then you're going to have to fucking,
you got to break up with him again.

569
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.060
You know,
it's like fucking Iraq.
We just did it right the first time.

570
00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:36.590
Wouldn't have to go back the second time,
you know,
it didn't make any sense.

571
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.120
Um,
all right,
next one bill.
Get a gun.
Look Buddy.
Look Buddy.

572
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.630
It's simple.
Get a gun.
I'm totally,

573
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.320
totally going to be like stereotypically.
When I finished,

574
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.810
when I first started banging my lawyer,

575
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.250
I'd stay over her place almost every night.

576
00:33:55.670 --> 00:34:00.670
She was still finishing up her divorce and the ex was still in dick mode.

577
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.990
Jesus Christ.
I remember one night,

578
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:06.560
slash morning she woke me up saying she heard something downstairs.

579
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.960
She insisted I go down and look.

580
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.240
I'd stayed silent pretending I was just waiting to hear it.
Really.

581
00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:18.860
I was shitting myself on the inside core shoe where nobody wants to go down

582
00:34:18.861 --> 00:34:22.550
there and figure out who the fuck it is.
All she had was a pen

583
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:24.410
weight.

584
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:29.030
All she had was a pen that I thought I could Nicolas cage into a neck if I had

585
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:33.890
to butt naked,
but naked I'm walking around scared as hell.

586
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:37.100
Pen in hand,
come up empty.
And soon enough,

587
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.060
uh,
wait,
came up empty.

588
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:46.061
So every now you didn't find anybody and as soon enough bought a Taurus PT one

589
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:47.150
40 pro.

590
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:51.740
It's a sidearm I shot once and keeping an arm's reach of my bed.

591
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.310
I'll tell you what,
Mr [inaudible],
I sleep like a baby and I'm relaxed.

592
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.820
I'm relaxed knowing it's there.
Plus it makes you feel like a man.

593
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.070
Maybe if you start pick,
pack and heat,

594
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.250
you'll get off you period.

595
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:08.600
Your period and quit bitching about how bad your podcast sucks.

596
00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:11.150
One more thing.
Who is the greatest American band?

597
00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.920
Creedence Clearwater revival.
Um,

598
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.070
first of all,
dude,
uh,
you fucking,

599
00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:25.040
you went out and got a gun.
You shot at once and then that's it.

600
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.330
You don't want to get good at it.
Actually went shooting this week.

601
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.280
I went to the gun range.
Everybody,

602
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.170
I shot a five shot 38 and I shot a,

603
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.590
I shot a nine millimeter and I got to tell you something.

604
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.800
It was fucking terrifying at first and then quickly became awesome and I enjoyed

605
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:47.040
the entire process.
I enjoyed loading it.
I enjoyed shooting it.

606
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.790
The skill of trying to hit the target on the,
you know,

607
00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:57.050
taking the shells out of the five shot and uh,
you know,
they let me clean it.

608
00:35:57.051 --> 00:35:57.884
I would have loved it.

609
00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.610
I was like fucking a private pile in full metal jacket by the end of it.

610
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:10.370
Fucking looking down,
up through my eyebrows.
I completely enjoyed it.
Um,

611
00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:11.680
<v 2>okay.</v>

612
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.990
<v 1>But uh,
you don't sound like you respect it sir.</v>

613
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.040
You sound like the kind of guy who shouldn't have a gun.
If you ask me.

614
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.200
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

615
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.160
<v 4>you shot at once and I keep an an arm reach your bed and now you fucking sleep</v>

616
00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:24.851
like a baby.

617
00:36:24.851 --> 00:36:27.970
Cause I know it's there and I'll just fucking waving around the you gotta we

618
00:36:27.971 --> 00:36:32.920
gotta watch out with a gun is,
it's an instant black belt.
That's the thing.

619
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:34.600
And he didn't go through the discipline of it.

620
00:36:34.601 --> 00:36:37.450
So you got to respect the fact that you could fucking kill somebody.

621
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.130
I know the guy,
right?
I'm just saying this right now.

622
00:36:39.131 --> 00:36:43.450
So this guy could fucking go to the gun range tomorrow and putting like a red

623
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:47.380
wig on his targets and start fucking shooting at it.
Um,

624
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.620
that's the thing about gun,
it's this amazing power when you have it,

625
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.860
this amazing power that you have to fucking,
uh,
I don't know.

626
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.720
That's what I felt when I had it.
I was just like,

627
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.810
you have this and you have the ability to take a fucking life.

628
00:36:59.811 --> 00:37:04.120
And it was like really like a,
you know,

629
00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:05.800
I didn't get this psycho charge from it.

630
00:37:05.801 --> 00:37:08.650
I felt like this ridiculous level of responsibility.

631
00:37:08.651 --> 00:37:11.650
Like I was holding a baby near an alligator Assam Shit.

632
00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:16.030
Does that make any fucking sense?
It's the people who fucking get those gets,

633
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.781
you know what it's like,

634
00:37:16.781 --> 00:37:20.080
people will get pimples and they treat him nice and then other people will get

635
00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:24.670
pit bulls and they try to make,
turn the dog into the bad ass.
They never were.

636
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.710
You know what I mean?
You kind of coming off like that,

637
00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:30.400
why the fuck would you only shoot at once and then you keep it loaded by the

638
00:37:30.401 --> 00:37:31.300
side of your bed?

639
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

640
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:37.720
<v 1>You know,
I uh,
I got like three or four different contexts and I'm going,
who,</v>

641
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.660
who like serious gun safety,

642
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:46.700
um,
courses that I'm going to take and whatever gun I get,

643
00:37:46.701 --> 00:37:49.880
I'm going to know how to fucking take that thing apart,
put it back together.

644
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.510
Everything about it go to the gun range a zillion times.

645
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.800
So I'm proficient with the fucking weapon and,
and then,
you know,

646
00:37:57.801 --> 00:38:01.010
keep it in a safe God damn place where no one can get hurt with it.

647
00:38:01.011 --> 00:38:04.760
And if somebody fucks with me,
I could instantly get it,
you know,

648
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:06.911
that's my deal.

649
00:38:06.911 --> 00:38:10.090
I'm not going to shoot it once and then keep it by my bed and I fucking feel

650
00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:12.790
safe now.
Man,
why don't you get off your period?

651
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.610
Why is that what you're talking all tough now cause you got your gun.

652
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.550
How come you didn't talk shit about my podcast before?
What?

653
00:38:18.551 --> 00:38:22.960
Cause you are unarmed.
Huh?
I'm gonna push this guy over the edge anyways.

654
00:38:22.961 --> 00:38:26.050
He says who's your foods is the greatest American band?

655
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.270
A fucking Aerosmith?

656
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

657
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.670
<v 1>Creedence Clearwater revival.
You don't think all their songs sound the same?</v>

658
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.190
<v 4>Same.
Well bring your near when</v>

659
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.530
<v 1>I was just done little bar,</v>

660
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.100
something about us swap,

661
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.980
even though we're all from Sacramento,

662
00:38:45.981 --> 00:38:48.420
the shit don't make no sales.

663
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.130
All Susie Q,
Bam,
Bam,
wham.

664
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.440
Actually like Korean scholar water revival.
But uh,
my brother,
when I was a kid,

665
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.090
he bought like the fucking eight cassette greatest hits thing that I'm sure

666
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:07.170
their manager put out.
Remember that song?
Vans Kid,
dad's bird,

667
00:39:07.171 --> 00:39:11.010
he'll steal your buddy.
Um,
he put it,
he put that shit out.

668
00:39:11.011 --> 00:39:12.360
I'm sure he got all the fucking money.

669
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:17.420
And my brother listened to those things over and over and over and over again.

670
00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:20.280
And it got to the point I fucking,
I,
I hated the band,

671
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.740
but it's been 20 years since I've listened to them.

672
00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:24.900
And every once in a while I hear when I'm starting to like him again.

673
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:29.010
It's Kinda like led Zeppelin,
led Zeppelin.
I listened to every,
you know,

674
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.660
how overplayed stairway to heaven is.
I did that to every one of their songs.
And,

675
00:39:33.661 --> 00:39:38.350
uh,
yeah,
it became like when I started here in led Zeppelin,
it was like,
you know,

676
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:41.680
that moment in clockwork orange when they're holding his fucking eyes open and

677
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:43.630
he starts to get sick when he sees violence.

678
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.340
Like I would get like nauseous when I heard him.
Um,

679
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.030
I would say Aerosmith.

680
00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:53.903
<v 0>Is that right?</v>

681
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:59.930
<v 1>I Dunno,
I'm fucking old.
I like Aero Smith then make it fucking albums to what?</v>

682
00:39:59.931 --> 00:40:03.530
40 goddamn years.
Doesn't that count for something?

683
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.100
CCR seven 37 Coleman out of this guy.

684
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.140
You know what?
February from Sacramento.

685
00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:17.350
How come they never said hello in any of their songs?
Can anybody tell me that?

686
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.270
Anybody explain that to me?
The fuck am I talking about?

00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:29.380
I've got a gun now.
Now I'm going to talk shit.
You know,
fucking assholes.

704
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:33.530
Asshole thinks you're giving you a BB gun.
Um,
alright.
Overrated.

705
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:38.390
Underrated for this week.
Uh,
underrated,
uh,
tee tops on a Pontiac Firebird.

706
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:42.470
Oh,
Jesus.
It's my childhood right there because nothing beats getting.

707
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:48.770
Can you guys proof proof read your shit.
Oh,
getting dome.
Okay.

708
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:52.520
Because I'm sorry this one's on me because nothing beats getting dome in your

709
00:41:52.521 --> 00:41:56.660
parked car while you get to look at the stars.

710
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:04.880
He says it's one of the most awesome things you'll get to experience.

711
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.260
Wow,
dude.
You know what?
You just painted a picture.
I think I gotta.

712
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:11.150
I gotta add that to my bucket list.

713
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.430
<v 2>Okay?</v>

714
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.260
<v 1>You know what to,
you can't,
you can't be like just on the street.</v>

715
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.490
You can't hear the sound of the street.

716
00:42:17.491 --> 00:42:21.600
You got to go to someplace to kill secluded.
Right on a fucking moonlit night

717
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.210
have some chick blow units.
You know,

718
00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.670
she'd probably actually think that that was romantic.

719
00:42:27.671 --> 00:42:30.710
He only thing missing in that whole thing is a unicorn.
Alright?

720
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.950
Overrated imports.
Imports.

721
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.930
I'm referring to all the Japanese burners you see on the streets.

722
00:42:37.931 --> 00:42:42.250
The Honda civics,
the Acura Integra is the Nissan to 40 SX.

723
00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.440
Everybody thinks they,
they,

724
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:48.280
they're the shit and they want to race him when in reality they wouldn't stand a

725
00:42:48.281 --> 00:42:52.840
chance against good ole American muscle.
What are your thoughts?
Uh,

726
00:42:52.841 --> 00:42:55.030
I don't know that I know enough about racing though.
It doesn't,

727
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.970
this Honda doall right in Formula One.
I know it's all German,
right?

728
00:42:57.971 --> 00:43:01.900
Mercedes and uh,
obviously Ferrari does great.

729
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:07.660
Um,
well I,
I this,
this is the deal,
when I think of high,

730
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:12.760
high speed performance,
I think of Porsche,
Porsche is,

731
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:14.170
or whoever the fuck he supposed to say it.

732
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.870
Lamborghinis all the Italian and German shit.

733
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:21.740
That's what I think about Maseratis,
you know,
and when I think

734
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.580
<v 5>Gov,
uh,
you want to fuck and line them up.
You want to Rice,
man,</v>

735
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:27.290
you want to go fucking,

736
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.610
you want to get sunk into your seat and go in a straight line as fast as you can

737
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:32.450
fucking can.

738
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:36.790
<v 1>Then I think American cars,
you know what I mean?
Who's kidding?</v>

739
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:40.210
Who are cars can't corn.
Not because we're stupid.

740
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.230
It's just we don't need to corner because we have land over here.

741
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:47.380
We're not like those fucking countries.
And over in Europe where they just,

742
00:43:47.381 --> 00:43:51.410
every one's the size of fucking Rhode Island.
So there's a lot of turns.
And then,

743
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.960
you know,
and not to mention they made the fucking roads,
you know,

744
00:43:55.961 --> 00:43:58.510
back when they were fucking bring an oxen to town and Shit,

745
00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.000
hairpin fucking turns.

746
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.270
You watched the Tour de France is fucking guys in the bicycles.

747
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:08.170
They can't even make the fucking turns over there.
So because of that,

748
00:44:08.171 --> 00:44:10.180
because of that handicapped,
I think that they actually make,

749
00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:13.810
they make better cars than us.
But as far as the Japanese stuff,
um,

750
00:44:13.811 --> 00:44:17.140
I think the Japanese,
you know,
I don't have an original opinion about it,

751
00:44:17.141 --> 00:44:19.810
but I think they took what we were doing.
You know,

752
00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:22.690
we took a lot from the Europeans and then they took what we were doing and they

753
00:44:22.691 --> 00:44:27.640
just didn't,
they improved it.
Ah,
stop rolling your fucking eyes.

754
00:44:27.641 --> 00:44:31.290
You know what I'm talking about?
If you change the oil on a Toyota or a Honda,

755
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.190
that fucking

756
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:36.180
<v 4>every three to two,
3000 miles,
that fucking thing is gonna.
It's gonna.</v>

757
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.850
You get 800,000 miles out of it.
All right.

758
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.040
And I know American cars have made it come back.

759
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:46.041
But you got understand Ima scarred child of the 80s and in the fucking late

760
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.190
seventies,
right through the 80s,
they made American cars.

761
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.420
There was a corporate decision,

762
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:55.260
they made them so they would self destruct 60 to 80,000 miles in,

763
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.770
you know,
telling you they just,

764
00:44:59.771 --> 00:45:03.850
the fucking transmission would drop out and it was done on purpose.
Terrible.

765
00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.810
And I still think that the American auto industry is trying to cover from that,

766
00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.950
despite the fact that they now have 10 year,
hundred thousand mile warranties.

767
00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:17.060
Um,
I don't know.
That's that.
That's my fucking thoughts.

768
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.270
All right.
I like,
uh,
I like some of the Japanese stuff,

769
00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.810
you know,
just as far,
I mean,
I've got a fucking Toyota Prius.

770
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.170
I love that God damn car.
I love it.

771
00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:33.310
I don't care that people call me a fag when I'm driving it.
You know,

772
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.880
I'm still comfortable with me.
Went to the fucking night.

773
00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:42.880
I filled it up with gas today.
35 bucks.
Go Fuck Yourself.
All right,

774
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:43.840
go fuck yourself.

775
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:48.760
Also filled up my truck and that costs me 65 for three quarters of a tank,

776
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.850
underrated.
Going to a hockey game early and watching warmups.

777
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:57.630
There's no one around you.
You will,

778
00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.360
there's no one around you with dumb foam fingers or micro web drink.

779
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.540
Microbrew drinking brothers.
I can't even fucking read this week.

780
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.620
Plus you can watch all the players fuck off and try cool shit all the while

781
00:46:09.621 --> 00:46:12.980
trying to snipe on the backup goalie.
Yeah,
that's actually true.

782
00:46:12.981 --> 00:46:16.070
Have you guys been watching the NHL playoffs?
Playoffs?

783
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.620
I've been watching a,
the Bruins capitals.
Um,

784
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.890
that's like a great pitcher's duel,
except it's the goalies.

785
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.680
Both games give gone into overtime.
But uh,
I've also been watching the fly

786
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:31.671
first.

787
00:46:31.671 --> 00:46:36.671
The penguins and I have a weird sports relationship with both of those teams in

788
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:42.570
Pittsburgh.
I liked the penguins fans.
I hate their fucking team.

789
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.340
I hate them.
All right.

790
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.210
Like I think the rangers coach sum them up and shouldn't have been fine.

791
00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:52.260
He should have been given an award.
All right.

792
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.810
There are fucking filthy God damn team and anybody does anything to them.

793
00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.810
They fucking bitch moaning.
Klein,
you saw what the fuck they did today?

794
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.040
I thought it was the filthy flyers.
We,

795
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.210
the penguins getting all mad down three games to none.

796
00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:09.090
They start fucking cross checking people in their throat,
right.

797
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.810
Fucking doing all kinds of reprehensible shit.
I don't,
you know,

798
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.940
I totally respect that franchise because they,
their ability to go from,

799
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.620
you know,

800
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:27.620
Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jaeger and within 20 years to have another one,

801
00:47:28.681 --> 00:47:30.110
two punch Crosby and Malkin

802
00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:33.970
<v 1>is this,
you know,
and Jordan stall.
I mean that they're fucking,
they're the shit.</v>

803
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:38.850
Tremendous fucking franchise.
But I,
I don't,
I don't like,
you know,

804
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.373
I dunno.

805
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.170
They always seem to have those guys that really like to go after people's

806
00:47:43.171 --> 00:47:45.600
fucking niece,
you know?

807
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.110
And then you got a fucking a Paulie,
pouty lips there,

808
00:47:49.111 --> 00:47:52.740
bitch moaning and complaining.
Just see,
I'm trying to fight,
not throwing a punch,

809
00:47:52.741 --> 00:47:54.190
not throwing a punch,
not throwing a punch.

810
00:47:54.191 --> 00:47:56.490
And then it comes to raft and he starts throwing a fucking punch.

811
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.640
And at the end of the game when there's no ref around,
the guy wanted to go.

812
00:47:59.641 --> 00:48:04.450
He wouldn't go.
What the fuck?
Either fight or raw.
Don't run your,

813
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:08.120
Yep.
All right.
And then the flyers.

814
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.270
I love the flyers,
but I hate their fucking fads.

815
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:20.020
I don't like this.
And out of the deal,

816
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.340
they don't like their offense.
You know,

817
00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:25.580
I told you the deal and went to a Bruins game with my mom up in Boston.

818
00:48:25.581 --> 00:48:28.730
There was flyer fans behind me and they would crass and they ruined it and my

819
00:48:28.731 --> 00:48:31.220
mother was there and it was just fucking,
they just assholes.

820
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.010
The fucking assholes.
But I loved the team.

821
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:38.000
So I've been watching that series and it's a,

822
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.380
<v 0>okay.</v>

823
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.760
<v 1>It's just been fucking,
I don't know.
I know it's been difficult,
but uh,</v>

824
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.890
what are you,
what are the flyer fence think?
What do you guys think?

825
00:48:45.891 --> 00:48:48.450
You think this is year you're going to win your cup anywhere.

826
00:48:48.451 --> 00:48:49.490
I think your weaknesses,

827
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.610
I think it's your fucking goalie with his weird colored pads.

828
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:57.260
I know you're up three games to none against the penguins,

829
00:48:57.261 --> 00:49:02.261
but I have you noticed that your goalie has given up 12 goals in three games.

830
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:07.640
That's not a good,
that's not a good thing.
Averaging,
giving up four goals a game.

831
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:09.943
<v 0>You know,</v>

832
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:14.030
<v 1>if the fucking penguins goalie wasn't,
I dunno what the fuck he looks like.</v>

833
00:49:14.031 --> 00:49:17.060
He's playing twister every time they come down.
He's fucking God is,

834
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.190
he's on all fours with his arms crossed.
I don't even,

835
00:49:19.191 --> 00:49:22.970
what the fuck he's doing is the puck.
He's like trying to like streets pain,

836
00:49:22.971 --> 00:49:26.240
like whack a mole with the God damn puck.
Um,

837
00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:33.140
and I'm watching,
I'm missing it right now.
I'm watching the king's Vancouver,

838
00:49:33.141 --> 00:49:36.800
which was zero zero when I came downstairs,
loving the kinks,

839
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:41.990
loving the Kings,
beaten the Vancouver Canucks,
loving him.

840
00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:43.873
You know,

841
00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.760
it's another team flopping all over the God damn ice.
Jesus Christ.

842
00:49:49.761 --> 00:49:51.860
If any NHL player listens to this shit,

843
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:55.490
I swear to God they're either going to hug me or fucking punched me in the face,

844
00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.270
depending,
depending on who you play for.
Um,
you know,

845
00:49:59.271 --> 00:50:01.100
this is what I like at the Bruins.
Don't win it.

846
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.553
<v 0>Uh,</v>

847
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.010
<v 1>who would I like to see?
I would say the La Kings,</v>

848
00:50:08.011 --> 00:50:12.300
but I just know some la kings fans are also Laker fans and I wished them no

849
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:16.200
happiness whatsoever.
So it would be hard,
even though I liked the kinks.

850
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:20.850
Um,
I think,
I think I'd have to say the,

851
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:26.050
I like the St Louis Blues just cause they've never won a fucking Stanley Cup.

852
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.880
They almost had the president's
trophy.
But I mean,
I just,
I just like they,
uh,

853
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.810
I went to,
I went to a game when I was in Saint Louis and they have real,

854
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.140
they got real fans,
old school,
hardcore fucking fans.

855
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.650
Like a lot of those teams in the north,
even though the,
the old,
the old Norse,

856
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.700
it's weird.
I like,
I like Saint Louis,
Angelic Chicago,

857
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:49.370
which I know is sacked religious if you live in either one of those cities.

858
00:50:49.371 --> 00:50:52.970
But I just liked both teams.
Uh,
there,
I fucking said it.

859
00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:56.270
And I used to like Vancouver until last year when we played them in the finals

860
00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:01.190
and they were just,
uh,
you know,
flip flopping all over the fucking ice,
you know,

861
00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:03.890
the year of,
you know,
but that's,
that's called the sport over in Europe.

862
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:08.240
It's called a beautiful game.
You know,
when you,
I dunno,

863
00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.570
you cheat and in a feminine manner,

864
00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:12.773
<v 2>you know,</v>

865
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.310
<v 1>that's what you guys are bringing to the table.
I mean,</v>

866
00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:18.470
I'll admit that with fat and stupid over here.
We don't read.

867
00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:20.160
Can you guys at least admit that you're fucking right.

868
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

869
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:26.360
<v 1>Bunch of flop and bitches over there.
Um,
now Jesus has another fucking place.</v>

870
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:31.250
I don't have to watch my back.
Ah,
overrated.
China.
China is overrated.

871
00:51:31.251 --> 00:51:33.830
All right.
I spent last summer.
Dude,
if it wasn't for China,

872
00:51:33.831 --> 00:51:36.620
I wouldn't be able to fucking look at this laptop right now.

873
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.960
Isn't that what they make them?
I Dunno.

874
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.750
I just like bitching about shit and that really finding out what's going on.

875
00:51:41.751 --> 00:51:44.510
51 minutes in baby.
Uh,

876
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:49.511
I spent last summer in China studying law and staring at the top of black heads

877
00:51:50.811 --> 00:51:53.090
from my six,
three viewpoint.

878
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:56.721
Uh,

879
00:51:56.721 --> 00:52:01.721
the Chinese are an incredibly diverse culture and all that when compared to us

880
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:04.680
Americans,
but many,
if not all,

881
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.610
am I going to start reading some racist shit this early?
Okay,

882
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.410
let's just go slow here.

883
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.920
Chinese are an incredibly diverse culture in all that when compared to us

884
00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:19.910
Americans.
Doesn't that just sound like the opening of something racist?
You know,

885
00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:23.150
they're really diverse and all that stuff and junk and all that stuff.

886
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.013
But you know,

887
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.890
<v 2>yeah,</v>

888
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.690
<v 1>but many,
if not all of those differences are pro precisely what makes America</v>

889
00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.383
<v 2>what</v>

890
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.440
<v 1>but many if not all of the,</v>

891
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.010
all those differences are precisely what America makes America.

892
00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:44.720
So for lack of a better word,
oh so bad.
Frigging ass

893
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:51.260
Chinese are incredibly diverse culture.
I can't even,
what the fuck is he saying?

894
00:52:51.261 --> 00:52:52.094
So now he's,

895
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:59.090
you just said that there are diverse culture and all that when compared to us.

896
00:52:59.091 --> 00:53:01.220
And then you started saying that.
Now what?
We're diverse.

897
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:05.580
I don't understand what he's saying here.
He said there their food.

898
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.660
I guess Chinese food could not be anything close to what any sensible human

899
00:53:09.661 --> 00:53:12.960
being could call decent.
You don't get,

900
00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:14.701
I don't know what the word is,

901
00:53:14.701 --> 00:53:19.701
p way or none of that in China you get some nasty noodles or even the nice

902
00:53:21.421 --> 00:53:26.130
restaurants paired up with the whole,
the whole fish eyes.
And,
and mind you,

903
00:53:26.131 --> 00:53:29.040
this is,
this is breakfast,
lunch and dinner.
We're talking,

904
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:34.110
I won't even go into the dog issue.
See attached photo.
What?

905
00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.840
I'm not looking at the attached photo.
What do you got?

906
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:44.600
A dog hanging from a fucking Hook in a window.
Anyways.

907
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:49.050
Um,
when I got back to the states,

908
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:53.340
the first place I went was in and out for a six by six.
Not Kidding.

909
00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:55.710
I didn't know what that means.
And I nearly choked at,

910
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.650
chocked it up and snorted it.
Oh,
chopped it up and snort it.
It,

911
00:53:59.651 --> 00:54:04.320
you wrote shocked a noodles will never be the same for that.

912
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.970
Fuck you China.
Come on and do it.

913
00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.900
That I don't want to be trashed in China like this.
The cities are filthy bay.

914
00:54:10.901 --> 00:54:15.120
Jared,
he didn't have a good time over there.
Uh,

915
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:20.330
most important to people or a holes.
Not all of them.
Maybe not seek,

916
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.970
did I call it or what?
The government doesn't give a flying fuck about them.

917
00:54:24.971 --> 00:54:27.550
So they figure,
hey,
one IP and asshole,
right.

918
00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.690
Is this what these is what they said to you?
Or this is what you sort of a,

919
00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:34.781
I mean,

920
00:54:34.781 --> 00:54:39.070
it's just say that the government doesn't give a fuck about them is really just

921
00:54:39.071 --> 00:54:41.410
sort of a,
you kind of skimming the surface there.

922
00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:45.740
I don't think it aren't they underneath an oppressive,
uh,

923
00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:47.710
when he called regime over there,

924
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:52.090
they have that weird thing where they have all like this technology and iPhones

925
00:54:52.091 --> 00:54:54.070
and iPads mean shit.
They build them right?

926
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.190
The cell phones are actually better than ours yet.

927
00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.710
If you say anything about their fury.
Dot.

928
00:54:59.711 --> 00:55:02.890
Doesn't like they run over you and it with like a tank.
Sorry,

929
00:55:02.891 --> 00:55:06.850
I'm just piecing together clips I've seen in CNN for the last 20 fucking years.

930
00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:12.100
Um,
so he tells me some story.

931
00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:12.963
Uh,

932
00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:15.231
<v 4>oh,</v>

933
00:55:15.231 --> 00:55:18.410
he's seen Barry Sanders couldn't get through a crowd without getting bruised up,

934
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.350
without getting a bruise,
ribbed amount,
a pack subway one night.

935
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:24.920
And this fucker behind me is digging his scrawny little elbow into my kidneys.

936
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:28.910
I'm ready to turn around and rabbit punched the cock sucker when I get off and I

937
00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:32.240
finally get room to take a full breath in and actually turn around.

938
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.050
It's this little frigging old lady with the shit eating grin on her face.

939
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:39.950
I was so close,
Bill.
Yeah.
Uh,
you know,
sound.

940
00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.160
I was getting on a flight one time and somebody was elbowing me in the back and

941
00:55:43.161 --> 00:55:46.460
I turned around and it was,
I believe a little Chinese wound,

942
00:55:46.461 --> 00:55:48.500
but you gotta understand.
It's so jam packed over there.

943
00:55:48.501 --> 00:55:51.230
That's just part of their culture.
They're not being dicks.

944
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:56.210
That's just like them beeping a horn.
I think.
Um,
so yeah.
Don't,

945
00:55:56.211 --> 00:55:59.000
don't punch an old lady in the face or we underrated manners.

946
00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.820
Now that I'm talking about Buffy and banging at the country,

947
00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.850
not that I'm talking about Buffy and Baggins at the country club type shit,

948
00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:10.750
I'm talking about the friendly pardon means,
excuse me,
oops,
my bad,
et cetera.

949
00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.340
There's none of that shit.

950
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:15.160
Maybe I was unlucky or the fact that I'm a huge American guy.

951
00:56:15.161 --> 00:56:17.650
They treated me particularly awful.
But at the end of the day,

952
00:56:17.651 --> 00:56:21.610
I was so aggravated by the repeated nudges,
spitting in my path,

953
00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:23.980
burping within a few feet of that,
I

954
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:29.190
<v 1>took everything from me not to pounce it at least one on one person daily.</v>

955
00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.420
Uh,
yeah dude.
I mean you're dealing with a different culture over there.

956
00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:36.190
I mean there's six fucking billion,

957
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.480
7 billion people on the planet and I think like they have over a billion of them

958
00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:46.240
there.
So
I dunno.

959
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:50.240
I think you just sorta missed America.
You know,
we all got our shit.

960
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:53.510
This is good stuff in best stuff.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't be trashing China.
Okay.

961
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:57.980
All right.
I already feel guilty enough that I bought this God damn laptop,

962
00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.130
even though I knew what the fuck those people are going through over there,

963
00:57:01.131 --> 00:57:01.970
who put them together.

964
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:06.800
You know how you guys honestly telling me that's the only way that you can,

965
00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:11.230
that they can keep this thing,
you know,
for the price that it is.

966
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:15.880
Can't like the CEO's make a little bit less money when you get to that level.

967
00:57:15.881 --> 00:57:19.210
You know?
You know what I love about the,
the sociopaths in the corporate world,

968
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.140
they always just have,
well I mean,
you know the price,

969
00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:25.740
let the market will bear the market,
will bear it.
The

970
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:27.760
<v 2>okay.</v>

971
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.370
<v 1>You know,
and just completely removing themselves.</v>

972
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:31.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

973
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:32.310
<v 1>I Dunno,</v>

974
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:36.990
I have such fucking hatred for that and all the way the other side,

975
00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:40.200
you know,
Neil was making dinner tonight,
right?
Cause he's a fucking angel.

976
00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.800
Absolute Angel,
right?
She's making me this awesome meal and she needed this,

977
00:57:43.801 --> 00:57:46.200
right?
So she goes,
can you go to trainees jealous?

978
00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:51.740
He got change Joe's and get some jasmine rice and I like abso-fucking-lutely

979
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:57.180
right?
So I jumped in the Prius and I drive over to fuck a trader Joe's.

980
00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.290
Okay.
Uh,
I got out and I got to tell you something man.

981
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.990
Maybe cause it was,
I dunno,

982
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:07.980
the level of Douche bag in a trader Joe's,

983
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:12.630
like if you ever just want it to rid the world of Douche bags,
um,

984
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:18.980
yeah,
I would start at trader Joe's.
You know what?

985
00:58:18.981 --> 00:58:21.960
Maybe it's just an La thing.
I went in there and just every fuck,

986
00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:22.611
you know what it looked like.

987
00:58:22.611 --> 00:58:25.610
It looked like a bunch of rich kids trying to dress like they were poor.

988
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.750
Every one of them was just fucking annoying with,

989
00:58:29.751 --> 00:58:33.110
they're ridiculously on purpose,
ugly way of dressing.

990
00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:38.270
Just each one of them just trying to be more and more out of style.
Hey Man,

991
00:58:38.271 --> 00:58:42.790
I don't even know what's instead whole Fuckin hipster thing.
Awful.

992
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:48.100
You know?
Thank God I showed up.
Look,
I want like,

993
00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:53.060
I'm not a Douche bag,
you know,
I think that they look at me just the way I dress.

994
00:58:53.061 --> 00:58:56.990
Like they think I'm some frat boy,
date rapist,
you know,

995
00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:00.230
just because I have a,

996
00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:05.090
I look like I could actually catch a ball.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

997
00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.360
We're gonna be trying to paint myself like I'm the bad ass at the trader Joe's.

998
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.160
You know what I think?
I think we've,

999
00:59:10.161 --> 00:59:14.060
I think I've had about enough of this podcast for this week.
I have an early,
uh,

1000
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:17.690
early call time tomorrow.
Everybody.
Um,

1001
00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:23.870
all right,
so what do I say now?
What do I say?
Oh,
amazon.com.
Every one.
Um,

1002
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.040
you want to donate to the podcast and support the troops.

1003
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:30.410
Here's how you can do it.
All right?

1004
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:35.780
Anytime you go on to amazon.com rather than just going directly to amazon.com

1005
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.060
you know,
just swing by bill bird.com.

1006
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:43.061
Click on the podcast page and then click on the Amazon banner on the right hand

1007
00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:46.490
side of the podcast page.
And I know what you're thinking.
Well,
Jesus,
Bill,

1008
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:51.740
that's fucking two extra steps.
Well,
you know what it is?

1009
00:59:51.741 --> 00:59:53.900
Two extra steps,
but listen to what you'll be doing.

1010
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:58.550
You'll go to amazon.com you don't have to do anything else.
Do you buy something?

1011
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:01.790
Not saying you have to,
but if you do,
I get a kickback on that.

1012
01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.790
Then I take 10% of the kickback and I give it to the troops.

1013
01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.900
What do you think about that?
So you can fuck,

1014
01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:11.990
I support my par cash and the troops,

1015
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.690
the wounded warriors project all at the same time.

1016
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.190
Don't you think that's worth two extra steps?
Come on.
You know,

1017
01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:20.480
he did something bad this week.

1018
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.320
<v 4>We all did.
Don't you need a little bit of Good Karma?
You know,</v>

1019
01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:28.220
just something some someday after you die and you're standing there in front of

1020
01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:31.550
Oh,
G gee isn't his dad.
And he'd be like,
well,
hey,
you know,

1021
01:00:31.551 --> 01:00:36.420
I went to bill burrs podcast and uh,
you know,
I actually don't say my name.

1022
01:00:36.421 --> 01:00:39.650
That's probably not a good thing to do up there.
Um,
uh,
you know,
I,

1023
01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:43.760
I fucked and donate it to a,
the wounded warriors project,

1024
01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.253
<v 0>you know.</v>

1025
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:52.110
<v 1>All right.
That's it.
I've had enough.
Have you had enough?</v>

1026
01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.060
I hope you enjoyed this podcast as much as I did.
I had a really good time.

1027
01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:01.680
I enjoyed myself.
You know what?
It turned me on.

1028
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:04.740
I got a Wah Wah pedal.
[inaudible]

1029
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.320
<v 4>I am so close to two.</v>

1030
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.350
I am so close to a level of fucking awful in the guitar,

1031
01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.483
<v 0>you know,</v>

1032
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:13.890
<v 4>you don't have,
you know what I'm saying?</v>

1033
01:01:13.891 --> 01:01:15.840
Like you have to be like a certain level of awful.

1034
01:01:15.841 --> 01:01:17.610
You just can't be completely fucking awful.

1035
01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:20.130
It just makes somebody turn their head.
I'm,
I'm at a level,

1036
01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:25.230
I'm almost at that level where it's actually listened to bubble and it'll be

1037
01:01:25.231 --> 01:01:28.740
hilarious.
So,
um,
if you guys egg me on,

1038
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:33.390
I'm learning how to solo in a,
in a minor.
All right,

1039
01:01:33.391 --> 01:01:37.080
I'll fuck around with my Wah Wah pedal.
Maybe sing you some tunes.

1040
01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:37.781
<v 1>Hi.</v>

1041
01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:42.420
Will that fill up your fucking days while you're waiting for somebody to change

1042
01:01:42.421 --> 01:01:45.780
your life for the love of your life to walk in through the door,
right?

1043
01:01:45.781 --> 01:01:48.510
If just sitting there going,
oh,
I don't know who to talk to.

1044
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:54.240
This is what I want you to know.
It'd be great for all of your soul's today.

1045
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.320
Why don't you get up?

1046
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:59.700
Put your head like halfway over your fucking cubicle wall,

1047
01:01:59.701 --> 01:02:02.790
never sitting next to you.
Just go,
hey,
hey.
When they look at you and be like,

1048
01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:08.760
just fucking give him the finger.
Fuck you.
What was that for?
You know,

1049
01:02:08.761 --> 01:02:13.680
because every time I look at you,
you remind me of what I've also accepted.

1050
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.533
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1051
01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:19.990
<v 1>what is that bank?
You know what the fuck it means having an</v>

1052
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:24.990
<v 4>office with walls that don't reach the ceiling without a fucking door.</v>

1053
01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.140
You know what I'm talking about,
right?
You lock in with there.

1054
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:31.300
You speak passionately.
Next thing,
you know,

1055
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.810
next thing you know you're banging her.

1056
01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:40.820
Maybe act like you're working late and you go in and you're fucking 40 Kate
Ryan,

1057
01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:44.870
your boss's desk,
not realizing that he is 24 hours security and it's being

1058
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.230
recorded by some fucking fat.
Fuck.

1059
01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:51.960
We supposed to be a security guard and rather than going in there and stopping

1060
01:02:51.961 --> 01:02:52.260
it,

1061
01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.250
he decides to record it so we can put it on his youtube page and maybe get some

1062
01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:59.730
hits.
Maybe we can talk about it loudly in a bar and be like,

1063
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:01.740
oh I was the guy who uploaded it,
you know?

1064
01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.340
And then some pathetic girl whose dad took off when he was when she was three

1065
01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:07.530
years old,
will overhear that and actually blow that guy.

1066
01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:13.380
See that it's called the winds of change right there on a butterfly.

1067
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:17.160
Flaps its fucking wings.
Ah,
Jesus.
What am I talking about?
All right,

1068
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.350
that's a podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

1069
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.110
And I mean that took from the bottom of my heart.

1070
01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.740
Each and every one of you can go fuck yourselves this week and don't take any

1071
01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:28.920
shit.
And I just,
just this week,
well you know what you do,

1072
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:32.130
why don't you guys start sabotaging those cubicle fucking walls?

1073
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.120
She's every week.
Just take us one screw out.

1074
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:41.670
You know what you do is start far away from your cubicle at first so no one

1075
01:03:41.671 --> 01:03:45.360
suspects you.
And then once they start getting wise,
take one out near you.

1076
01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.410
Cause why would you do that?
Your cubicle,

1077
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.950
why would you leave that evidence right near year?
You like Sharon Stone,

1078
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:57.300
you know,
then you were Larry Bird shorts with no underwear underneath it.

1079
01:03:57.301 --> 01:03:59.640
You then you uncross and then cross your legs,

1080
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.210
flashing a little ball bag when they interrogate you and that's how you get out

1081
01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:04.800
of it.
That's how she did it right in the end.

1082
01:04:04.801 --> 01:04:08.550
She still at the ice pick under the bed.
All right,
that's it.
Um,

1083
01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:11.550
I got nothing else.
Hey.
Hey you.

1084
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.760
I'm fucking April 27th I'm going to be a Concord college in Concord,

1085
01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:19.410
New Hampshire.
And unlike most of the college gigs I do,

1086
01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.170
this one is actually open to the public.
So if you are too stupid to,

1087
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.100
again in that school,
you know,

1088
01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:31.310
and you fucking plow the streets and get hammered afterwards wearing your high

1089
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:35.250
school football jacket.
And he always wondered what fucking college was like,

1090
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:38.310
why don't you come on down to Concord College in Concord,

1091
01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:43.311
New Hampshire on fucking April 27th and I will be there telling my jokes.

1092
01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.420
All right,
have a good day.
