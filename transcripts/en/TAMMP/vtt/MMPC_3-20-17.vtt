00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.400
Okay.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.170
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?</v>

3
00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:05.840
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.420
<v 0>March 19th.</v>

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.680
<v 1>Dude,
I'm in a great mood.
Boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,</v>

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.970
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.
Um,
I'm gonna,
I dunno why just sang that song.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.550
I just been watching a bunch of fucking old,
you know,

8
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:23.730
I listened to old country now and then I started listening to old fucking rock

9
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.450
and roll.
You know what's his face just died.

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.470
The guy used to fucking film chick steady shit on or something,

11
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:35.630
whatever his name is.
Chuck Berry.
Oh whoa.

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.900
You know,
it's part of one of his classics.
Abuse in the background.

13
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:40.980
You're getting him shitting on people.

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.560
I have such respect for him too.
You know,

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.250
it's just one stuff like that gets up once it gets out.

16
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.940
Anyway,
so I just been a,

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.180
I'm in a great fucking mood because my fucking show,

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.830
I had this a rotator cuff injury and it's just been fucking with me since,

19
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:09.240
um,
October and,
uh,
I finally found an exercise

20
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.930
<v 0>works for me.
For me,
I just feel like for my shoulder,</v>

21
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.510
my shoulder needs his safe place.

22
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.760
Ooh.
A lot of crying out there.

23
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.100
<v 1>Um,
all right,
so this is,</v>

24
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:34.100
this is the exercise.
If your,
if your rotator cuff is fucked up,
like mine is.

25
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.820
The problem is,
is if you can look what this injury,

26
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:40.190
it's like he can still pick up the same amount of weight.

27
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:42.350
You can always pick up depending on the angle,

28
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.520
but then shaking hands or just reaching for a salt shaker,

29
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.550
all of a sudden you like ha this sharp pain.

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.730
It's basically what I've learned is it's the muscle.

31
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:57.650
Like it's when you first go to raise your arm,
that first 30 degrees,

32
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.390
that's what the fuck it is.

33
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.910
And then the big boys take over whatever you're doing.

34
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:05.000
How are you lifting your lunch pail up?
Maybe you got a giant fucking doughnut.

35
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:09.770
You want to shove a do you face like I did today,
I broke my rules about donuts.

36
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.660
You know,
my,
uh,
my wife,
uh,
was wanting some donuts.

37
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.080
So I went by,
there's a Dunkin donuts out here,
right?

38
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:21.590
So I show up and it's late in the day.
It's like fucking two in the afternoon.

39
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:25.640
So all the donuts are gone.
You know,
they're still making them,

40
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:28.550
but they don't have,
you know,
they don't have that freshness to them.

41
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.600
They got those,
you know,
the little Munchkins,
they like the worst flavors left.

42
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:36.350
It was like blueberry custard and fuck your mother,

43
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:39.710
whatever the fuck it was called.
And I was like,
that's what you got left.

44
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:41.050
They were like,
yeah.
I said,
I,
I left.

45
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.680
This is after the people in front of me could not make up their mind,
you know,

46
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.310
can I get,
we get a dozen donuts and they lay him down.

47
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:52.430
Now that's how long it's been since I've seen anybody get it done and don't say

48
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:53.270
lay them down.

49
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.810
Back in the day they stood him up and the frosted from one doughnut gun on

50
00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:58.940
another donut,
you know,

51
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.830
I never gently with all the I phones coming out for somebody finally decided,

52
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:05.920
why don't we make the box a different shape and we'll lay him down.

53
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.070
And I imagined the Steve jobs of Dunkin donuts went to some sort of comic con of

54
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:16.060
fat people and he came out and a turtle neck sweater with this fucking new

55
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:20.800
balance sneakers.
And He fucking showed off the box and everybody went,
oh my God.

56
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:24.040
Right there fucking man titties bouncing up and down

57
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.720
and you'd think he gave credit to the,

58
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.540
to the poor little fucking eight year old in the back room.

59
00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:33.280
We'll had to put those things together.
Huh?

60
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.490
The blind nine year old girl who fucking designed the box down in fucking east

61
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.260
Albuquerque.
You think he gave him any credit cards?
He didn't.

62
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.120
Of course he didn't.
Oh,
look who's here.
My two angels.

63
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.700
Qt number one in QT number two.
What's up buddy?
Hey,

64
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.490
this is some bad language and if she can't understand it anyways,

65
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.530
what's going on?
Do you want to be on the podcast?
Nini?
Sure.

66
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.070
Well grab a mic.
They'll cook,
Cook,
Cook.
You shake my nerve when you read them a,

67
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.150
but um,
yeah,
you've got to grab stuff in the bag.
Anyway.

68
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:12.640
So what did you do?
What did we,
what did I do?

69
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.770
I know,
I know.
Come back,
come back in a minute.

70
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.620
Come back in a minute and I'm in the middle of this story.
Oh,
all right.

71
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.390
All right.
Okay.
Bye Cutie.
Um,

72
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.321
you know,

73
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.230
that fucking guy a little time to make the donuts tell was just an actor.

74
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.310
So anyway,
so I call up near,
okay.
And I just go,
yeah,

75
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:36.340
they don't have any fucking doubt.
It's a dead donuts suck there anyways.

76
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:40.810
And she went,
oh my God.
She goes,
blasphemy.
A guy from Boston,

77
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:45.280
which I'm not.
I'm from the Boston area.
I'm from the safe suburbs.
All right.

78
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.060
So you could take your goodwill hunting fucking quotes and I,
you can talk.

79
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:51.820
Tell him to somebody else.
Cause I grew up in a nice suburb.
There was,

80
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.430
it was called the sacks.
We played street hockey.

81
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.390
We roasted marshmallows.
All right?

82
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.200
There was no,
it's not your fault.
There was none of that shit.

83
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.130
Nobody liked apples.
And I sucked at math.
Okay.
That's it.

84
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.740
I climbed trees and uh,
and I had a paper route.
Okay.

85
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:14.180
So enough with the southeast shit.

86
00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:18.890
Anybody every from Massachusetts is not from South Boston.
We didn't steal cars.

87
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.810
Okay.
A lot of us are from the suburbs.
We slept in bunk beds.

88
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.870
I'm so sick of that fucking movie.

89
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.250
Where you from?
You just,
you just say,
uh,

90
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:38.300
you know from Massachusetts Cell Southie.
Did you grow up in Southie?

91
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.380
Did you like apples?
Did you say?

92
00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:44.720
How about them apples down at the tasty,

93
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.260
like some fucking stuck up.

94
00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:51.860
Harvard con is going to mess with anybody ever from fucking,
well,

95
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.480
bacteroides South Boston used to be,

96
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.480
now they're all Harvard grads that live down there.
From what I've heard,

97
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.940
I have no,
I don't know what goes on in that city.
Okay.
Last time I lived there,

98
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.480
they were just starting the big dig and that big ugly green thing was still

99
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:07.780
there.
And going from Faneuil hall over to the North End,

100
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:09.070
you took your life in your hands.

101
00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:14.071
You just felt that you went underneath the fucking southeast expressway and it

102
00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:18.250
was scary,
you know?
Anyways,
what the fuck am I?
So I call her up and I just say,

103
00:06:18.251 --> 00:06:21.130
yeah,
I got the doughnut suck.
And she goes,
oh my God.
She goes,
a Boston guy,

104
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.070
St Dunkin donuts sucks.
That's blasphemy.
It's like Nia,

105
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.310
nobody gives a fuck about their donuts.
It's all about the coffee.

106
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.640
I don't drink the coffee.
I don't drink coffee.

107
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:35.470
I don't like it tastes like dirty water.
It Burns my tongue.
It stains your teeth.

108
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.330
It's just,
it's a fucking,
it's the Trifecta of,
you know,

109
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.040
I guess it helps you take it shit though.
I know a lot of people like a,
you know,

110
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.900
drink a coffee,
smoke a CIG,
take a good shit,
get on with my day.
You know,

111
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.970
I have a French fucking car.

112
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.980
It's all about the co did their bread and butter is the coffee.
Okay.

113
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.150
That's the lead singer.
That's like if,

114
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.640
if Dunkin donuts broke up and the coffee went solo.
All right.

115
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:05.570
That's the George Michael and the donuts or the,
uh,
the,
the,

116
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.460
whatever the other guy's name was Andrew Ridgeley.
Anyway,

117
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:14.750
so I go,
yeah,
fuck that place.
So,
uh,
oh,
you know,
people in front of me,

118
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:17.420
they couldn't make up their goddamn mind.
Like,
what do you want?
Ah,

119
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:22.240
why are you glad?
Send those,
Oh,

120
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:26.470
can we get to with,
let's get three of those.

121
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:30.610
They kept talking to each,
his happened.
We'll get three of the pink ones.

122
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.800
Um,
and I was already having a bad day cause I'm,

123
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.950
I keep my truck and storage now cause we got the little one.

124
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:41.290
It's just easier for my wife to get in and out of the garage.

125
00:07:41.291 --> 00:07:45.280
And I knew if I kept my truck there and she always had to squeeze by it and try

126
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:48.040
and get the fucking stroller and all that shit,
you know,

127
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:49.990
it's going to happen eventually she's going to be like,

128
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.440
I dunno what do we need three cars for?

129
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.090
And eventually she's going to make me sell it.

130
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:59.290
So I did a preemptive strike and I immediately put it in fucking storage before

131
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:04.030
she could bitch about it.
So I had it over the last fucking like five days love.

132
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.160
And so I just switch out.
All right.

133
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.300
I put Jackie in storage and I take out the old girl.
Right.

134
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:11.980
And I drove her for like five fucking days.

135
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.010
Of course the battery died cause I forgot the unhooked the uh,

136
00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:18.550
the terminals there had to get a jump down at the comedy store.

137
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.950
Um,
and uh,
anyway,

138
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:28.240
so I'm going to return the car today and it's the day before I go on the road.

139
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:31.870
So we have a rule in my house,
in my house,
there is a role,

140
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.840
um,
the basically the day before I go on the road,
I bitched family day,

141
00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:41.620
I hang out,
you know,
I make breakfast,
I made some fucking meatballs,

142
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:44.800
are cooked the God damn chicken.
I make sure that she's got food in the fridge,

143
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.810
you know,
I'm a hell of it,
so I make sure she's going to be all right.
Right?

144
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.670
So I go out,
I got to return my truck.
She's like Pete Pack.
I'm like,

145
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:57.020
I'm going to be back.
So,
all right.

146
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.580
So I get in the truck and I do what I always do.
I drive down the phone,

147
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.630
I gotta move fucking,
you know,
I got to move her car.

148
00:09:02.631 --> 00:09:05.270
I become like a valet cause I had the shittiest driveway.
You have it right.

149
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.340
So I'm fucking driving up the street and as always,
big stupid grin on my face.

150
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.890
It's my favorite thing ever.
It's three on the tree.

151
00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:16.910
It's so much fun to drive and whenever I get a little bit of space out here and

152
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:19.850
I just get the fucking run through all three gears,
that's all I want to do.

153
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.720
Every time I do,
I get buy in.
When the second I get it into third gear,

154
00:09:23.721 --> 00:09:26.900
I always have the window down.
Even though I put some ac in there,

155
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:28.850
I never fucking you.
I didn't use it for so long.

156
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:31.580
I turned it on and all this white shit came out and I breathed it in and

157
00:09:31.581 --> 00:09:34.370
probably took like fucking nine years off my life.

158
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.020
Anytime I get it up into third gear and I'm cruising down the street,

159
00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:42.850
I always do the same thing.
I was going,
yeah,
every time.

160
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.910
I never did that once in nine years old and my Prius ever,
it's just,

161
00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:53.911
it's still greatest sound in the fucking world is the sign of a big fucking

162
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.790
American engine.

163
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.070
Maybe running through the fucking gears,
loud pipes.

164
00:10:03.071 --> 00:10:07.240
It's the greatest fucking sound ever.
And every time I get to go up the street,

165
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:11.680
right,
so I'm having a great time.
You know,
I'm driving down the street.

166
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.230
I got the am radio one,

167
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.040
I usually listen to Keyshawn Johnson is fucking sports show,
but you know,

168
00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:22.420
it's the weekend.
So it wasn't on in any ways.
I get on to,
um,

169
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:24.521
you know,

170
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:29.080
again onto the fucking highway and of course I'm cruising along and right before

171
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.760
we get to,
I get to my exit,
it's just like this traffic from fucking,

172
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.870
it's like five in the afternoon traffic of a fucking truck jack knife.

173
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.720
And it's just,
of course my exit.
And I told the people I'd be over there by noon,

174
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.600
so I'm starting to feel stressed,
so I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

175
00:10:46.601 --> 00:10:49.270
So I tried to make a fucking,
you know,
a bust and move here.
Right.

176
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.180
Even though I'm from the suburbs,
Massachusetts move,

177
00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:53.710
I'm going to go round all this shit,

178
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.190
act like I'm going to drive by and then I'm going to fucking cut in and I don't

179
00:10:57.191 --> 00:11:00.910
know what the fuck was going on.
I couldn't see any,
any accident.

180
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:04.540
So I'm trying to go from one highway to another,
so like I know what I'll do.

181
00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:07.600
I'll just fucking,
rather than go east,
like I want to,

182
00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:11.830
I'll just get on the west side,
I'll take the highway west,
go down one exit,

183
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.980
and then I'll curl back around because I could see on the overpass there's no

184
00:11:14.981 --> 00:11:16.090
fucking traffic.

185
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.430
I don't know whether it was like this offshoot to the on ramp,
right?

186
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.860
That everyone was going down.
Like,
I don't know what they're like.

187
00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:27.910
Paul Simon was doing like a free concert,
some shit that was the level of,
of,

188
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.290
of uh,
traffic.
So I say,
fuck it.

189
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.410
I get out of the traffic,
I drive down and get it up to third game.

190
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.910
<v 2>Ooh,
right.</v>

191
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.150
<v 1>I fucking go to go west to turn one fucking block in a one,</v>

192
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.400
one exit up and then come back around.
And as I fucking go there,

193
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:48.450
all of a sudden this is all this other traffic going the other direction.
And I,

194
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.500
and this is the first time since I started meditating that I had an absolute

195
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:56.640
meltdown.
I literally screamed as loud as I possibly could.

196
00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.350
Fuck you la,

197
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.490
every fucking cock sucking mother fucking con fucking every word you could

198
00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:09.430
possibly think,
you know,
and then I'm fucking just stuck.

199
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:13.480
And even worse traffic going the other way to go,
one fucking exit,
you know,

200
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.490
up to come back around.

201
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.960
And all I'm thinking is where the fuck I would be if I just took the pain to

202
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:22.480
begin with and just stayed in that traffic jam.

203
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:24.910
I'd be creeping forward and whatever.

204
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.720
Why didn't I just call the place to say I was going to be a little late?

205
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.720
Oh you know what bill,
cause that would have been the chill thing to do,
right?

206
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:36.220
I didn't.
So it turns out,
I look up,
I'm like,
what the,

207
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.710
this is like,
it's Saturday at noon.

208
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

209
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.410
<v 1>How was he at five o'clock in the afternoon on Friday?
Traffic?</v>

210
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:45.060
I like literally beside myself.

211
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

212
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.800
<v 1>Just saying every curse I possibly can.</v>

213
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.820
And I look up and there's two little flashers going on and it's tow truck

214
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:56.910
flashers.
Right.
And I'm like,
Oh,
here we go.
Hey,

215
00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:01.110
this is all rubber necking and on the other side of the road it's fucking going,

216
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:04.800
you know,
like gang busters,
everybody's cruise and by that's where I want to be.

217
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.733
<v 0>Okay.</v>

218
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.560
<v 1>Right.
And I can't get to it.
So I'm like,</v>

219
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.940
you fucking fucking rubber neck and pieces.
What's something we change?

220
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:16.780
Changing a tire.

221
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.420
It's going to be a fender bender and I'm losing my shit out there.

222
00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:20.950
If I was a fucking dictator,

223
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.130
I would deliberately have a car on the side of the road changing a tire.

224
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.560
He'll never slowed down and looked at it would be eliminated,

225
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.420
would be removed from society.
Fred to the fucking pigs.

226
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:32.390
Whatever the hell is what happened.

227
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.310
That fest fucking North Korea does to his God damn relatives feeds them to dogs.

228
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:39.520
That's what I would do.
I was actually,
I was so fucking mad.
I was like,

229
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:44.170
you know that Fed fucking North Korea.
He's actually making sense to me,
you know,

230
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.430
so I get all the way up.
I should be careful,
man.
He makes sense.

231
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:52.090
Somebody over here,
a misdemeanor.
I'm like,
he did do his other,
you know,

232
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:53.710
we set up those two fucking whores over there,

233
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:57.280
right to take out his fucking stepbrother.
Um,
so anyways,

234
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.080
I get all the way up to uh,

235
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.330
the traffic jam and of course it's a little fender bender.

236
00:14:01.331 --> 00:14:03.970
There's people standing there,
there's nothing going on,

237
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.110
but I'm finally going to get past it.
Finally going to get off the exit,

238
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.010
come around and fucking run through the gears and fucking go down the other
side.

239
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:15.520
And what do I see on the other side of the road where it was all nice and clear.

240
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.260
Now these major traffic can because the dumb comments on the other side of the

241
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:23.350
highway,
I was slowing down to look at the shit on my side of the highway.

242
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.520
So now I've got to sit to a fucking twice and something told me,

243
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.390
don't get off at the first exit bill.
Everybody has this idea.

244
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.080
Go to the second exit and you know,
and then come back and guess what I did?

245
00:14:35.081 --> 00:14:39.860
I ignored that instinct.
Got Off the first one,
BombBomb,

246
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.100
BombBomb down,
fucking dead stopped traffic.

247
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.160
And the only way to get back on the highways.

248
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:47.590
I've got to make this illegal uturn and I don't give a fuck.

249
00:14:47.591 --> 00:14:51.700
I'm making it and I'm just sitting there cock motherfucking dictative fucking

250
00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:55.570
cut all their fucking heads off and I'm getting ready to make my illegal u turn

251
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.290
and I just happened to look in my your rear view mirror and guess what's two

252
00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:01.780
cars behind me?
A fucking cop.

253
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:09.120
I'm like,
what are the fucking odds now I got to go straight.
I said fuck this.

254
00:15:09.121 --> 00:15:13.710
So I get in the right lane and I just cruise up and I get out of his sight.

255
00:15:13.711 --> 00:15:16.850
I finally fucking turn around.
I got no,

256
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.830
I finally gotten to a good lane and I came back and then I got back under under

257
00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:23.400
traffic again,
looked at the same people looking at the same accident.

258
00:15:23.401 --> 00:15:27.090
There was nothing going on and then I fucking finally was able to continue on

259
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.890
and of course they made the call.
There was no problem.
Nobody gave a shit.

260
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.000
Nobody yelled at me.
It was fine.
I completely lost my shit and I'm in bed.

261
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:41.210
I got so fucking mad that when I saw the people on the other side of the road,

262
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.720
rubber necking,

263
00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:48.510
I gave them the finger and I was all the way to the right getting off the

264
00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:51.240
highway and I gave all of the family it like,

265
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.790
do you realize how immature that is?

266
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.120
I mean I was just like,

267
00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.190
have you ever been embarrassed about yourself by yourself?

268
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.730
Like I actually hit that level cause like I stuck my whole fucking arm out the

269
00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:08.580
window giving him the finger.
The person behind me could see,
it'd be like,

270
00:16:08.581 --> 00:16:12.910
who's this guy giving him the finger too?
You know,

271
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.060
I basically said it wasn't one of my best moments.
But anyways,

272
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.550
as I mentioned earlier,
um,
I,

273
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.910
one of the great things is I,

274
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.970
somebody showed me this exercise for a rehabbing the rotator cuff and it's

275
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.880
fucking been great.
First of all,

276
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.800
what you do is you basically either be a bend over at the waist.

277
00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:41.350
Now you're not going to take it up the ass.
Okay?

278
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.120
Before anybody makes that easy joke.

279
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:45.910
He let your arm hang down and then what you start doing,

280
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.650
it's basically your finger,
your whole,
your fingers are pointed at the floor,

281
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.580
your arms hanging straight down,
and you just make small circles,
right?

282
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.830
And counterclockwise or clockwise.

283
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.580
And then you just start to make it bigger and bigger chest to just get to the

284
00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:03.190
point of pain.
And then you'll live there for a minute.

285
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:06.790
Then you back it back down to small circles and then go clockwise.

286
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.790
If you want counterclockwise,
you just go vice versa.

287
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.980
You just go the other direction.
You do the same thing again.
Whatever that does,

288
00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:14.440
it kind of gets some fucking mental loop in there.
I have no idea.

289
00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:19.030
I don't know shit about anatomy.
Right?
Um,
and anyways,

290
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.060
and then what you do is you have your arm straight out,

291
00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.050
not straight out.
You have it down at an angle.
You walk up to a wall.
All right,

292
00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:32.230
I have to explain this part perfectly.
All right.
And by the way,

293
00:17:32.231 --> 00:17:34.990
you're your own risk on this one.
Um,

294
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.880
you have your arm probably at like a whatever,
15 degree angle.

295
00:17:39.881 --> 00:17:44.500
You're standing right next to the wall.
Um,
sideways.
Okay.

296
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.520
That perpendicular to the wall.
I have no fucking idea.
All right.
It's like,

297
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.170
just imagine wall was your friend and the two of you went to a,
uh,

298
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.620
a general admission concert and you got there early.

299
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.630
Just imagine what the space would be between the two of you,

300
00:17:56.631 --> 00:17:58.670
but you'd be both looking at the same shit,
right?

301
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.150
That's still doesn't make sense.
Perpendicularly the fucking thing.
All right,

302
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.000
then you,
so you reach out.
You touched the wall.
Alright.
Yeah.

303
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.030
Arms at a 15 degree angle and then you just slowly start walking it up and

304
00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:12.680
obviously as it gets more straight,

305
00:18:12.681 --> 00:18:16.640
you're going to have to move your body further away from the wall and you just

306
00:18:16.641 --> 00:18:20.810
walk it up with your fingers.
So it's basically,

307
00:18:20.811 --> 00:18:23.300
it's the weight of your arm,
but your fingers are taken away,

308
00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:28.301
most of the weight and walk it all the fucking way up until it's like you know

309
00:18:28.911 --> 00:18:32.840
the answer in a classroom and you're so excited and you're straight up and then

310
00:18:32.841 --> 00:18:35.390
you walk it back down.
You do a set of three to five.

311
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.630
And I did it.
I've been doing it twice a day.
Am I fucking shoulders amazing.

312
00:18:40.631 --> 00:18:45.550
And then I sit afterwards.
Um,
and it feels fucking amazing.

313
00:18:45.551 --> 00:18:48.820
I actually sat down,
played a little drums today.
It was fucking phenomenal.

314
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.990
And uh,
I dunno maybe that maybe somebody can explain it a little bit better.

315
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.550
Maybe there's a youtube video of it.
I don't know.
Um,

316
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.720
so anyways,
that's what I've been doing and I feel great.
And um,

317
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.300
the guy who,
uh,

318
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.560
<v 0>okay</v>

319
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.710
<v 1>is basically keeping my dog for the rest of her life.</v>

320
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:10.960
So I know she'll be safe,
uh,

321
00:19:10.961 --> 00:19:15.460
was in town and he brought her by and I got to take her on a couple of hikes we

322
00:19:15.461 --> 00:19:20.080
hung out.
And um,
you know,
it's sort of like a shared custody thing.

323
00:19:20.081 --> 00:19:24.130
I mean he has like 95% of the time,
but I know she saved,

324
00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:26.770
she looked great and um,

325
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.250
<v 0>okay.</v>

326
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.890
<v 1>It's awesome.
I Dunno,
I dunno if it's good or bad for me to keep seeing her,</v>

327
00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:34.520
cause it's always fucking unbelievably sad every time when I give her back.

328
00:19:34.521 --> 00:19:36.830
But as long as I know the next time I'm going to see her,

329
00:19:36.831 --> 00:19:38.060
then I kind of have hope or whatever.

330
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.930
I just keep jokingly say that she went to college and this is like spring break,

331
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:45.380
you know,
she comes back in March or whatever.
But um,

332
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.360
but it,
it's,
it,
you know,
what's great is I know she's okay.

333
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.110
I know she's going to live out a full life and you know,

334
00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:57.920
whenever that day comes,
when she's coming down to the end of it,

335
00:19:57.921 --> 00:20:01.480
I'm going to be there.
Cause I always,
I kinda made a promise,
you know,
you know,

336
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.710
when you get a dog that's,
he's like,
you know,
that's it.

337
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.390
Like how much you love a dog.
It's like,
dude,
I'm there until the end.
And um,

338
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.680
you know,
even know where the way it worked out with having a kid and everything.

339
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.100
Um,
the,

340
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.950
the main point of the whole thing was that she survived and she had a great
life.

341
00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:19.670
She's got this,
you know,

342
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.360
she's living in a great house now in Arizona and all that type of shit.

343
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.750
And it just means I'll pull a plate Arizona more.

344
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.090
And the person who owns it makes frequent treat trips out here,

345
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.530
always drives out.

346
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.280
And I think a hello always bring her because he knows that we love our Nia.

347
00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:39.320
Got to see her and everything.
She came back over,

348
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:43.790
the house was hanging out and um,
you know,

349
00:20:43.791 --> 00:20:48.510
she met smelt like a,
so she was cool,
but it really was never a,

350
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.170
Oh my God,
I just sent her fucking name.
I just added her name.
Um,

351
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.110
anyways,
and uh,

352
00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.550
she just basically,
you know,
it was never about the kid.

353
00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:04.460
It was about everybody else that was going to be coming by and it was going to

354
00:21:04.461 --> 00:21:08.300
be too crazy and the dog was going to get even more protective.

355
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.600
And you know,
I went through with the whole trainer.

356
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.360
It was like the dog is going to go to a whole nother level and I just knew

357
00:21:14.361 --> 00:21:17.420
something,
something was going to happen with the craziness of having a kid.

358
00:21:17.421 --> 00:21:22.130
So we just,
we made the right decision.
Um,
anyways.

359
00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.480
Uh,
all right.
Where do we go from here?
Um,
I'm going to edit that out by the way.

360
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.220
That's going to know you guys.

361
00:21:28.221 --> 00:21:31.730
You said you should live this fucking know so many Weirdos out there.

362
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.990
So many Weirdos.
So anyways,
what have I been up to?

363
00:21:35.991 --> 00:21:40.790
I've been watching a little bit of the match madness as much as I can,

364
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.120
you know,
having the Kiddo around,
um,
I watch,

365
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.590
do you know when they're first round?
I don't know.

366
00:21:48.591 --> 00:21:51.020
I'm assuming they won the second round or I,
I would have,

367
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.970
I'm assuming that they're in the fucking sweet 16.
My Internet sucks right now.

368
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.390
The Internet is such a fucking,
I,
I went,
I spent all his fucking money.

369
00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.680
I was just like,
dude,
you get me fucking the Internet that Jesus would have.

370
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.620
And they said,
all right,
it's going to be 9 million bucks.
I said,

371
00:22:06.621 --> 00:22:10.700
I'll write that fucking check you,
you fucking criminal.
And they said,
fine.

372
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.680
And I had the best Internet for about six months and then slowly it just starts

373
00:22:15.681 --> 00:22:16.550
sucking again.

374
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.360
And what it is is I think they just turn the juice up on your house,

375
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.790
whoever's paying the most for it.

376
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.720
And then the next guy gets bumped back and then he's like,
hey,

377
00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:29.870
what the fuck happened to my gator internet?
Well,
you know,
we upgrade,

378
00:22:29.871 --> 00:22:32.870
but by then he plays,
whoever pays more than me.
See,

379
00:22:32.871 --> 00:22:36.050
I haven't gone back to them and like two years and now like I can't even get,

380
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.800
I get internet and like two rooms in my house and the rest of it sucks.

381
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.610
Let's see if I could look this up.
March madness.

382
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

383
00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.320
<v 1>Uh,</v>

384
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:48.540
<v 0>okay.</v>

385
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.800
<v 1>There we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
CBS Sports.
What's going on?
Come on.</v>

386
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.330
This is like,
you're rooting for the slowest source ever.
Now come on load.

387
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

388
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.870
<v 1>Oh my God.
It worked and it worked.
March madness,</v>

389
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:06.700
2017 live tournament scores.
Update.
Baba Baba Baba was the fucking bracket.

390
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.430
Kansas is the team.
We expect it.
I love Kansas.
I love cab.
Always.

391
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:15.940
I don't know why.
I've always loved Kansas.
I like Duke Ucla.

392
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:20.440
It's fucking fun to see them just because there's such a legendary franchise.

393
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.873
Um,

394
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.730
Syracuse exchange plan plans to extend Boeheim I don't see,
I mean,

395
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:34.060
how to watch Duke Versus Carolina.
What,
uh,

396
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:38.380
the number two blue devils will take on numbers.
Hold on the number seven.
Uh,
oh,

397
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:40.030
South Carolina,
North Carolina.

398
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.450
I won the fuck are they doing that and I got to wash it all.

399
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:45.620
All the Duke Games get get taped next year.

400
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:50.621
I think I'm going to add to my sports package and I want to watch as many of the

401
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.880
Duke Games and Kansas.
I don't know why.

402
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:57.770
I've always loved Kansas and Duke.
I got into,

403
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:00.770
cause I've got a couple of friends that went there and then I went to a game and

404
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:03.470
they treated us great.
So like,
wait,
what?
It's over.

405
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.190
I've got to call and coach k show.
It's all,
wait a second.

406
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.750
Did they lose
end of the second half?

407
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.320
Why the fucking gay cops beat them?

408
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.560
No.

409
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:27.780
88 81 get the fuck outta here.
No fucking way.

410
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

411
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.670
<v 1>No fucking way.
Duke Score.</v>

412
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:39.180
I just spelled scores
Duke score.

413
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.450
No fucking way.
Thank fucking lost.
Ah,

414
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.720
Jesus Christ.

415
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.190
South Carolina is scored 65 fucking points in the second half.

416
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.930
The score 23 in the first half.
Duke score 30 and 51.

417
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.730
Oh Man.
I mean,
I knew,
I knew that they didn't have the team this year,
but shit,

418
00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:06.090
I thought they at least get to the sweet 16.
Um,

419
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.400
well I hope that Jason Tatum guy doesn't be fucking one and done.

420
00:25:11.401 --> 00:25:13.910
I hope he comes back.
Um,

421
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.230
and I liked that loop canard kid.
You know,
grace,

422
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.910
he handed coming off the bench really well,
you'd think,
you know,

423
00:25:20.911 --> 00:25:23.090
with all that shit how he wanted to be hated,
you'd think he'd be a,

424
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.740
he think he pouted he think it would pile,
but he didn't.
Uh,

425
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.930
he was a fucking man about it.
All right,
well,
congratulations to South Carolina.

426
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.380
Jesus Christ.
I know a lot of Duke haters out there.

427
00:25:34.381 --> 00:25:38.520
Loved listening to that in real time.
Me discovering that they fucking lost.

428
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:44.020
Um,
God damn it.
All right.

429
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.990
Um,
Kansas sets my team,
Kansas Jayhawks.
Um,

430
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.330
I respect all of them and I,
I really don't like,
you know,

431
00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.550
I come from a pro sports town,
so,
uh,

432
00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.180
I don't really have any sort of hatred for anybody.
You know what I mean?

433
00:25:57.181 --> 00:26:00.090
I don't even hate the fucking North Carolina.
I don't even,

434
00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:03.000
I don't even fucking hate him.
I don't hate NC state.
I just like,

435
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.570
I love how the tradition of all that,
you know,
I could sit back,
I just,

436
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.520
I picked a fucking team so I can actually get involved in it,
I guess.

437
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.110
Um,
so anyways,
I'll root for Kansas the rest of the way.
Oh.

438
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.810
And I also like seeing UCL.
I do well.
Um,

439
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.050
and of course any,
any fucking underdog.
I was,

440
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.160
I was watching northwest and it's sucked watching them loose.
Did they?

441
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.640
They lost it.
They came back.
They were against the,
uh,
Gonzaga,

442
00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.190
who I'm so old to me,
there's still the new kids in town,

443
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.280
even though they've been crushing it for almost fucking two decades at this

444
00:26:35.281 --> 00:26:37.680
point.
Anyways,
let's get back to the podcast.
Let's get back to maybe something,

445
00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:41.490
build it.
You sort of know about.
How about that.
So anyways,

446
00:26:41.491 --> 00:26:45.370
I was listening to all this fucking old rock and roll shit,
you know,
and uh,

447
00:26:45.371 --> 00:26:46.680
of course,
if he listed all that shit,
you,

448
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:50.750
you're eventually going to run it to buddy Holly.
And,
uh,

449
00:26:50.751 --> 00:26:54.940
I was in that peg pay,
but to pick the pit,
the big

450
00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.960
man.
Um,

451
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.030
and I always loved the drums on that and I never knew what the fuck the guy was

452
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:07.630
doing.
I guess he was just playing paradiddles that Guy Jerry Alyson.
Um,

453
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.070
I just love the way he plays on that fucking song.

454
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.350
She's playing paradiddles around the kid.

455
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:17.520
He's got the snares off and I love about wherever the music's going,
if it's,

456
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:19.980
you know,
just playing those basic was at two chords.

457
00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:23.610
I don't know shit about guitar.
The brighter court,

458
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:26.040
he's up on the higher note or whatever is on the Higher Tom.

459
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:28.860
And then he goes to the floor,
Tom and then occasionally comes back to the snare.

460
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.970
It's just a fucking beautiful piece of music,
you know,
and I'm,

461
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.020
I'm learning this shit right now,
both my drum teacher

462
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.840
about how to finally get my paradiddles and shit and playing singles and doubles

463
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:43.591
going in and out,

464
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:47.880
getting them up to speed while being totally relaxed and letting the stick do

465
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:48.540
the work.

466
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.940
And it's the hardest motherfucking thing in the world because you've,

467
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.820
you already can play it up to a certain speed,

468
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.540
just your own fucked up technique way to just say fuck all of that and drop like

469
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:08.190
a hundred bpms,
you know,
and start all over again is a,

470
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:12.270
is a bitch.
But if,
uh,
if you stick with it,
um,

471
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.300
it gets,
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It gets pretty fucking exciting.

472
00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:18.860
We're all of a sudden,
it's just like,
wow,
I don't even feel like I'm,

473
00:28:18.861 --> 00:28:21.030
I'm exerting any effort whatsoever.

474
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:24.840
And I'm like three quarters up to what used to be my full speed.

475
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.700
Um,
I dunno.
It's exciting shit.
So by the way,
you know,
now that I get the Kiddo,

476
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.890
my lovely daughter,
um,
who every time I think I can't,
I'm not going to like,

477
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.200
you don't think the loves can go any further.

478
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.360
They develop more and more of their personality comes out and you're like,

479
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:46.010
oh my God,
she does that.
And it just goes to a whole little,

480
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.970
like now she's smiling like he can't believe.
Um,

481
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.520
and the other day I was sitting there,
I was with her and,
uh,
diapers clean,

482
00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.550
she's got a full belly,
I'm holding her,

483
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.760
I'm doing all this shit that usually stops it from crying and she's just been

484
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:06.570
cranking crying.
I was just like,
what the fuck could this possibly be?

485
00:29:06.571 --> 00:29:09.990
And that's my favorite part about being a parent right now is trying to figure

486
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:13.650
out the,
the riddle,
like what's going on with her.

487
00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:16.290
And you know what I figured out for all you guys with newborns,
you know,

488
00:29:16.291 --> 00:29:19.170
that it's starting to develop out there.
You know what I figured out?
I was like,

489
00:29:19.171 --> 00:29:22.800
she's fucking bored.
I'm doing the same shit.

490
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.510
And this shit was interesting for about a week to 10 days and now she's over it

491
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.960
because she's hit a new level of consciousness,
you know,

492
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:33.600
she could see a little bit better,
whatever here,
a little bit better.

493
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.320
She started understand all those on my feet,
you know,
she needs something else.

494
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.480
So,
um,
you know,
we do like this time,

495
00:29:41.481 --> 00:29:44.360
thank trying to get her to pick up her head and learn how to crawl and stuff.

496
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.200
So I brought her over to the little pad thing and it's this little thing that's

497
00:29:48.201 --> 00:29:52.220
got like in all these little rattles and shit hanging down from it.

498
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.640
I just turned her over onto her back and I had a look at those things and she

499
00:29:57.771 --> 00:30:01.400
just looked up and was completely enamored with them.

500
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.020
And like that's the new thing.
Now I put on our back,
when she looks at him,

501
00:30:06.021 --> 00:30:08.060
she smiles and I'm like that.
They're her friends.

502
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.440
And this is the greatest thing ever.

503
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.130
Because up until now I've had to carry around like a kettle bell everywhere I

504
00:30:13.131 --> 00:30:16.490
went.
And it was,
you know,
messing with my shoulder and shit.
But you know,

505
00:30:16.491 --> 00:30:19.880
you love your kids,
see you like fuck the shoulder.
The shoulder comes,
I distant,

506
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:25.520
you know,
20th in this race,
you know,
if the first 19 spots in my daughter,
right?

507
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.620
So,
um,

508
00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.680
now what's great is I can just bring that Tommy time thing into where I'm

509
00:30:34.521 --> 00:30:37.070
watching sports.
I put her on her back.

510
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:42.020
She's looking at the fucking her friends hanging and I can sit on the couch and

511
00:30:42.021 --> 00:30:45.860
keep that thing moving with my bass drum foot.
Right as I'm watching,

512
00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.980
as I'm watching the game,
it's like the greatest thing ever.

513
00:30:48.981 --> 00:30:51.760
I watched like a whole first half of 'em,

514
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:56.180
Northwestern Gonzaga.
I just sitting there doing that movement.

515
00:30:56.181 --> 00:30:57.110
It's the greatest thing ever.

516
00:30:57.111 --> 00:31:01.280
So if you've got a kid that's crying out there and the diapers clean and they

517
00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.150
have their,
their fallen all that,
maybe they're just bored.
Try something new,

518
00:31:05.151 --> 00:31:08.420
some new stimulus.
Um,
oh,
I was so psyched.
Right.

519
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.230
It's such a luxury to not have to be holding our air all every five seconds.

520
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:14.930
You know what I mean?

521
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.970
Because I like these little fucking kettlebells and they'll hold,

522
00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:22.180
they're hot as hell.
They like this hot water bottle,
you know,

523
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.550
day getting all hot.
Yeah.
Getting all,
fuck.
It's just awful.
It's like,
you see,

524
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.520
it's like you're stuck in a crowded elevator.

525
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.270
Uh,
yeah.
I feel like I'm going through menopause.
It's like,

526
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:38.560
do the fucking hot flashes here.
Hot flashes.
Um,
anyways,

527
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.650
so let's do a,
let's do a little bit of a,

528
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.810
let me read some of the advertising air.
Everybody,
the uh,
the advertiser.

529
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.960
What am I doing?
I just did,
I just opened the maps.
Why would I do that?
All right.

530
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.040
Oh,
dirty lemon.
You know,
I finally tried some of this stuff.
It takes a second.

531
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:56.020
It kind of tastes like shit a little bit with the blue,

532
00:31:56.021 --> 00:32:00.580
the lemon because it's got the fucking charcoal in there,
but once you drink it,

533
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.240
um,
you know,
it's all right.
But it also says on the side of the bottle,

534
00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:08.860
this has not been tested or approved by the food and Drug Administration.

535
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.911
So I was kind of like,

536
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:13.870
what the fuck am I putting in my body to be honest with you?
But you know,

537
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.760
here's their advertising.
Just being honest,
dirty lemon,
everybody.

538
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.940
Um,
evidently I've been seeing these stripe dirty lemon bottles everywhere.

539
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:28.420
I haven't.
And now I have them in my fridge.
I do.

540
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:34.020
Dirty lemon is a functional beverage brand with products with optimize various

541
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:36.940
areas of your life,
like vitamin water,

542
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:40.590
but without the added colors slash sugar.

543
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.920
Plus the products actually work well.
Maybe that's why it tastes like shit.

544
00:32:43.921 --> 00:32:48.030
They took the sugar out of it.
Uh,
there are three types now.
Sleep,
detox,

545
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.240
skin plus hair.
Jesus,
I need the last one like a fucking,

546
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.440
I needed this 10 years ago and each one contains the juice of one lemon.

547
00:32:55.441 --> 00:33:00.420
No sugar is blended with functional ingredients that actually work there.

548
00:33:00.421 --> 00:33:03.960
Asleep drink for example,
includes magnesium,
rosewater,

549
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:09.910
camel meal and passion flower,
all which help?
No wonder it tastes like shit.

550
00:33:09.911 --> 00:33:10.910
I'm drinking flowers here,

551
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.530
which helps you fall asleep fast and stay asleep through the night.

552
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:19.300
Evidently I drank one the other night before bed and had crazy dreams.

553
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.410
Talk about the dreams too.
These guys are weird.
I didn't drink this shit.

554
00:33:23.411 --> 00:33:27.130
I want to drink so it makes me have crazy dreams even though that I wouldn't

555
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.510
have a crazy fucking dream.

556
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.650
And the detox is secretly is a secretly great hangover.
Cure.

557
00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.060
Drink a bottle and the act debated charcoal absorbs toxins in your body.

558
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.990
Great.
After a long night out.
All right,
well shit,
I could have used that.
The,

559
00:33:40.991 --> 00:33:42.100
I should have drank that today.

560
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

561
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.880
<v 1>You know,
I know I said I was going to stop boozing,
but I've got a problem.</v>

562
00:33:45.881 --> 00:33:50.360
So I drank the on that,
but I cut the booze way down.
Whey the fuck down.

563
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.060
You know what I mean?
Like when you phases somebody out of your life,

564
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:55.220
but they kind of a psycho you get,
you can't do it abruptly.

565
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:58.630
You gotta kind of Aee sort of wall some over to somebody else.
All right,

566
00:33:58.631 --> 00:34:00.350
call to action.
Uh,

567
00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:03.290
the best part about dirty lemon is that there's only one way to order is via

568
00:34:03.291 --> 00:34:07.160
text message.
You'll never find it in stores to order,
go to dirty lemon.com.

569
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.220
Register your mobile number,
then send them a text message.

570
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.030
Say a low to a real human and a few texts.
After a few texts,

571
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:18.740
that six pack is sent to your door in one to two days.
Once you buy via text,

572
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.140
you'll never want to go back.
Well,
it's then that in stores.

573
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:22.940
How the fuck am I seeing them everywhere?

<v 0>Okay,</v>

586
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.640
<v 1>I got saggy thighs and that's not all,</v>

587
00:35:06.641 --> 00:35:11.140
but my balls are safe and they're nice in company with this fucking poker dot

588
00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:15.550
print here.
I got black and white Polka dot print right now.
Now this is,
you know,

589
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.470
you know what it reminded me of?

590
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.480
It reminded me it's one of the jerseys that when you win a stage and the Tour de

591
00:35:22.481 --> 00:35:26.770
France toward a France,

592
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.530
Jersey color meaning,

Let's see.

593
00:35:30.531 --> 00:35:32.420
What does the Polka does at the fast one?

594
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

<v 1>What does the yellow,

you're the leader.
Oh,
for Christ's sake.</v>

596
00:35:38.501 --> 00:35:41.260
What are the different jerseys mean?
What do we mean?

597
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.160
This is still part of the advertising.

598
00:35:45.161 --> 00:35:47.410
The different tour to France.

599
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

600
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.080
<v 1>You know what?
Thanks for nothing.
You can't,
what does this Click Bait?
Oh,</v>

601
00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.920

602
00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.270

Cycling Jersey.
Okay.
All right.

605
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.020
Where's the polka.one?
Oh,
it's red polka dot.

606
00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:16.000
What does that one mean?

607
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.820
Red Polka Dot Jersey means Oh,
you went up the mountain.

608
00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:27.130
You're the fastest motherfucker on the mom now,
right?
Well,
you know,
there you go.

609
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.600
Well that's what that means.

612
00:36:34.961 --> 00:36:37.830
Not everybody gets to see Bucko.

613
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.570
If you've been settling for store bought underwear,
five packs,

614
00:36:40.571 --> 00:36:43.930
I have something that will change your life for the better me undies.

615
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.450
What's the first thing you put on?
The last thing you take off.

616
00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.610
Don't say your socks.
You fucking Weirdo.
It's your underwear.

617
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.750

Feel good undies delivered right to your door.

620
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.690
Do you think you could have a fucking fight to the death naked?

621
00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.111
Do you think you would like,

622
00:37:06.111 --> 00:37:09.160
I would be so self conscious that my junk was hanging out.

623
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.670
Like if you fight your Rhonda where you'd be fine cause you feel like it,

624
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.290
that it's covered up.
Psychologically it's covered up.
You know what I mean?

625
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:18.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

626
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.230
<v 1>But I'm in it.
Despite the fact that somebody needs you in the balls.</v>

627
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:26.490
Even if he had on fucking,
you know,
Jay Leno,

628
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.900
fucking dad jeans,

629
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.460
it's still going to hurt just to pretty much just the same.

630
00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:34.440
But maybe it'd be a fucking underwear on.
I'm still going to hurt.

631
00:37:34.441 --> 00:37:38.160
But for such psychologically,
if you fought naked,
I don't think he could do it.

632
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.130
You know what I mean?
It takes a special someone to just be like,
yeah,
you know,

633
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:41.940
you know what it is.

634
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.150
It's those guys that get hookers that already let them kick them in the balls.

635
00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:48.900
You ever seen those guys?
If you ever seen those fucking porno videos?
I have.

636
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.760
They just boom,
right in the balls.

637
00:37:50.761 --> 00:37:52.650
It's one of the funniest things you're ever going to watch.

638
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.460
Um,
I dunno,
I bought for that funniest porn out there.

639
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.350
Is that a subset of comedy?
Funniest Porn?
I would say that.

640
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.090
And then those ones where the girls like make the choking sound on the Dick.

641
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.750
You know,
if the guys banging her and he's just cause she's going,
Whoa,
Whoa,

642
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.060
whoa on.
I like to it.
There's no way.

643
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.350
There's no way to not just burst out laughing.
I mean it's like three stooges.

644
00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:22.890
Like Schempp could make a funny noise in it anyways.

645
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.320
If you've been settling for store,
bought underwear,
what the fuck am I talking?

646
00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:29.490
Why me?
What is me on these you might ask.
Oh,
just seriously soft.

647
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.350
Feel good undies delivered right to your front door.
Um,

648
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:37.310
How do you know if the next to you is who lives next door to you is,

649
00:38:37.311 --> 00:38:39.590
is shooting porn?
How do you know?

650
00:38:39.591 --> 00:38:41.830
Because you'll be laying there in the afternoon.

651
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.070
All of a sudden you just hear hello from the other side of your driveway.

652
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.450
Mian he's are designed in La and made from sustainably sourced micro modal,

653
00:38:50.451 --> 00:38:53.660
modal,
a fabric three times softer than cotton.

654
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:58.460
Biondi softer than soft luxury on these comes in an ever changing selection of

655
00:38:58.461 --> 00:39:00.920
classic colors.
Bold shapes.

656
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.250
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

657
00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.460
<v 1>I mean there's only one way.
I mean,</v>

658
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:07.370
people are only shapes so many different ways and adventurous patterns.

659
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:11.430

661

How much do you shit yourself that you got to get underwear every month.

662
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.700
If you're not ready for a subscription,

drums and I can maybe go over there for a day or something like that.

774
00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:51.090
Cause I don't get to,
you know,

775
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:54.810
I'm always on the practice pads here and I miss playing drums and I'm learning

776
00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:57.450
all this cool shit.
And you know the deal man,

777
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.610
I'd love to get those Fucking v drums.

778
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.580
It'd be nice if they hooked me up with a free one and I could talk to my

779
00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:05.730
listeners about how awesome they were.
Wink,

I suck.
All right.

786
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.420
Donut shop while in San Jose.
Hey Bill,

787
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:31.020
I know you've been in San Jose.
I know you'd be here coming up.

788
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:34.620
And I think I know of a spot that's totally your style.

789
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:39.210
It's called Stan's donuts.
I know you're cutting the carbs and shit,

790
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:42.090
but God damn is it worth the extra elliptical time.

791
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.810
Just an old school doughnut shop that's been around for decades and it hasn't

792
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:49.260
changed a bit.
None of that crazy soy based,
gluten-free,

793
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.890
pomegranate fritter with cruelty free bacon bullshit.

794
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.840
Just the classics chocolate.

795
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.960
Maybe an old fashioned or jelly filled you fucking asshole.

796
00:46:57.961 --> 00:47:00.870
I'm trying to lose weight.
Don't tell me about this place,

797
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.570
but holy shit.

798
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.130
The only one you need from stands as the plain glazed donut.

799
00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:09.860
<v 0>Okay,</v>

800
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:14.150
<v 1>I'm going to be there with Dean del Rey.
Oh,
he's off sugar,
so he won't do it.</v>

801
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.450
They will give you a glazed doughnut,
so,
so fresh.

802
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.890
It might burn your mouth if you aren't careful and you can see them pulling them

803
00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:26.790
out of the fryer.
Just find the counter.
Can't be that dude.

804
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:31.450
My mom used to take me here before school when I was really little and I came

805
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:34.720
back for the first time in like 15 years the other day and it's even better than

806
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:38.170
I remembered.
Oh,
you got a little child sense memory going on there.

807
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.100
Oh my God,
Dude.
Why are you doing this to me?

808
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.850
Immediately thought of you and that you'd like the old school feel of the place.

809
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:49.570
It's like five minutes from the San Jose Improv.
Make it happen.

810
00:47:49.571 --> 00:47:50.650
Do it for standing.

811
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:53.610
<v 0>Oh God.
Yeah.</v>

812
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:57.930
<v 1>Well,
I can tell you that's definitely happening.
Well,</v>

813
00:47:57.931 --> 00:48:01.050
you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to do a tour of,
of San Jose.

814
00:48:01.051 --> 00:48:03.810
One of my city tours were definitely,
I'm going to fucking go there.

815
00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:07.760
I'm going to end.
They're eating a fucking doughnut.
Well,
maybe I'll start there.

816
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.280
Just hating myself.
All right.
Red Skins.

817
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:12.780
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

818
00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.320
<v 1>Redskins.</v>

819
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.290
I'm sitting here and listening to your podcast in the fast money past Monday,

820
00:48:16.291 --> 00:48:20.820
and I'm thinking about the Redskins.
Keep the name change the mascot.

821
00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.610
Change the mascot to a potato.

822
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:25.510
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

823
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.420
<v 1>that's fucking hilarious.
But in the,
that's not intimidating.</v>

824
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:32.590
You know what I mean?
The red skins and those,
of course,

825
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:36.670
the nickname would be the hash browns,
but you know what?

826
00:48:36.671 --> 00:48:41.320
You know Hash browns are delicious.
That's fucking hilarious.

827
00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.010
I Wa you know something that's actually fucking brilliant.

828
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.660
So you still call them the red skins.
You changed the mashed potatoes,
the math,

829
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:53.860
the mascot,
the mashed potato,
the mascot to a fucking potato.

830
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.570
You know something that's one of the most brilliant fucking ideas I think that's

831
00:48:58.571 --> 00:49:01.270
ever been fucking sent in.

832
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.080
God knows I've never said anything better than that.
That's fucking brilliant.

833
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.270
Change it to a fucking potato.

834
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.720
<v 0>Okay,</v>

835
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.180
<v 1>but then what do you have on the side of your helmet then?
You know what you do?</v>

836
00:49:12.181 --> 00:49:15.690
You just go back to the old logo with the are on the side.

837
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:16.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

838
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.130
<v 1>In the feather hanging off is the red skin.
Like you peel the potato,</v>

839
00:49:21.131 --> 00:49:23.770
you know the thing when people like they peel and they go all the way around in

840
00:49:23.771 --> 00:49:26.020
a circle,
it could be like that.

841
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.190
Great idea.
That right there.
That's a funny motherfucker.

842
00:49:31.191 --> 00:49:33.670
I hope you're very successful in life.
Thank you for the,
uh,

843
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:35.643
<v 0>okay.</v>

844
00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.470
<v 1>That's fucking right.
Why didn't I ever think of that ma'am?</v>

845
00:49:37.471 --> 00:49:41.010
I'm slipping as a comedian.
All right.
The Great Barrier Reef.

846
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:43.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

847
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:43.611
<v 1>By the way.</v>

848
00:49:43.611 --> 00:49:48.140
Did you hear Netflix is going to switch from the stars from FiveStars to thumbs

849
00:49:48.141 --> 00:49:51.620
up?
Thumbs down.
I don't know.
Why would you do that?

850
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:57.150
You know,
cause I give,
you know,
give,
if it's just thumbs up,
thumbs down.

851
00:49:57.151 --> 00:50:01.180
It's just such a wide peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

852
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:06.300
Thumbs up gourmet meal on the French Riviera watching the fucking from my yacht

853
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.820
watching the fucking,
the end of a Formula One race in Monaco.

854
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:17.560
Thumbs up the Godfather.
Thumbs up,

855
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.480
meatballs,
thumbs up.

856
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.770
<v 0>Do you know what I mean?</v>

857
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:27.290
<v 1>Drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth.
Thumbs,</v>

858
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.340
Adolf Hitler.
Thumbs down.

859
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.200
I guess cause they get the fucking ratings.
It doesn't matter.

860
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:39.170
But I mean I like it.
I like,
it lets me know,

861
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.530
you know like okay people like this.
How much do they like this?

862
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:49.530
I don't know.
Three stooges,
thumbs up,
Schindler's list,
thumbs up.

863
00:50:49.531 --> 00:50:53.640
I mean it's just a what?
What does anything mean?
Anything after that?
All right,

864
00:50:53.641 --> 00:50:57.150
great barrier reef.
Hey Billy boy.

865
00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:00.870
Huge fan of the show.
Thank you.

866
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.290
Remember you were talking about the Great Barrier Reef a couple of weeks or

867
00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:08.880
months ago.
Not Written,
not really sure anymore.
Too much weed,
man.
Anyway,

868
00:51:08.881 --> 00:51:12.510
I saw this on the front page of the New York Times and thought you would enjoy

869
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.580
shitting on Australia some more.

870
00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.920
I don't like shitting on Australia was just shitting on that guy.

871
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:20.760
It basically says that huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef that stretch

872
00:51:20.761 --> 00:51:25.210
across hundreds of miles where recently found dead and they were killed by over

873
00:51:25.211 --> 00:51:29.550
heated salt water.
I know this is coming from a liberal paper,

874
00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.860
but I think it's pretty clear evidence.

875
00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:35.160
There is such a significant global warming.
Anyway,

876
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.190
you fat a Bolo written piece of shit.

877
00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:43.080
Love the podcast and keep on keeping on.
Um,
yeah,

878
00:51:43.081 --> 00:51:44.820
I gotta be honest with you.
I don't watch,

879
00:51:44.821 --> 00:51:48.960
I don't read up on a lot of the environmental stuff cause it's too fucking

880
00:51:48.961 --> 00:51:52.950
depressing.
I love animals,
man.
I loved the Earth Man.

881
00:51:52.951 --> 00:51:57.940
I don't want to see fucking see life dying and all that shit.
Um,

882
00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:03.520
I dunno.
I Dunno what the,
it's just too many of us.
It's just like,

883
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.690
I think a plague is coming or,
um,

884
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:13.100
I actually think that the robots,
uh,

885
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:18.460
we'll be in control of the upper one percenters and they will gradually take all

886
00:52:18.461 --> 00:52:21.250
of us out.
And then what it will be,

887
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.300
will each one of those Illuminati guys will have their own robot

888
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.680
with all the answers.
I mean,
it's every,
it's so fucking,

889
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.740
it can play guitar like Jimi Hendrix.

890
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.700
It can design the most beautiful architecture.

891
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:41.290
It's the greatest farmer and they just,
whatever you needed to fucking do,

892
00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:44.980
we can do.
So you'll never go hungry.
You'll always be entertained.

893
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.090
And on top of that,
it'll be the best looking chick you've ever seen in life.

894
00:52:49.091 --> 00:52:51.160
And you can fuck his brains out.
I mean right there.

895
00:52:51.161 --> 00:52:54.850
If that's not going to be the extinction of all the regular people like,

896
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.030
like myself,
I think that that's what's going to happen.
And then,
um,

897
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:04.840
the earth's will gradually cool with all of our deaths.

898
00:53:04.841 --> 00:53:09.841
The Great Barrier Reef will come back and the upper 1% will have what they

899
00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:13.130
always wanted complete control.
Um,

900
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:16.960
but I should think they'll get bored after awhile.
You know,

901
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:21.610
there's nobody to oppress.
There's nobody looked down on,
you know,

902
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:23.740
that's actually a fascinating fucking movie.

903
00:53:23.741 --> 00:53:27.650
Would it be like there's just no more challenge,

904
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:33.320
right.
And those robots no.
Out of like,
you know,

905
00:53:33.321 --> 00:53:35.210
they can like grow an ear in a petri dish.

906
00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:38.720
Eventually we'll be able to grow all vitals,
you know what I mean?

907
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.240
And then you can just live forever

908
00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.770
at what would you do?
What would she do?
This is reason why you die.

909
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:51.900
You just run out of shit.
What the fuck would you do?

910
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:56.580
I would just keep learning shit.
It's like all right,

911
00:53:56.581 --> 00:54:00.210
for the next 80 like every 80 years you just picked B and something.

912
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:04.210
All right,
this 80 years I'm going to be a gear head.

913
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.280
I'm gonna learn how to take a whole fucking car apart,

914
00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:09.250
put it back together and make it fast,
fast and loud.

915
00:54:09.251 --> 00:54:12.700
I'll just learn how to do that shit.
I love the robot right here.

916
00:54:12.701 --> 00:54:15.460
It knows everything.
It'll fucking teach me how to do it.

917
00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:19.240
And then once I get it down,
you know,
and I do that for awhile,
you know,

918
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.580
fucking learn every instrument.
Learn every language.

919
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

920
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.460
<v 1>You're eventually just going to run out of shit to dope</v>

921
00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.080
and you'd just be looking at your robot just going like,
dude,

922
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.970
I know this is fucking nuts.
I know we've been together now,
sweetheart,

923
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.560
for fucking 800 years,
but could you do me a favor?

924
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.880
Do you want me to kick you in the balls?
Not know,
sweetheart.
I don't,

925
00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:47.893
it'd be funny if they,

926
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.710
even though it looked totally looked real until he felt like a real person,

927
00:54:51.711 --> 00:54:55.040
but they could never perfect the voice.
So it's still fucking talk like that.

928
00:54:56.250 --> 00:55:01.100
You are the best I've ever had.
Just like,

929
00:55:01.101 --> 00:55:06.060
bitch,
stop talking.
You kill it.
It for me.
Um,

930
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.150
you'd have to just say to the fucking thing,
look,
800 years.

931
00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:15.230
Okay,
I'm coming up on 800 years.
All right.

932
00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.740
I've lived more years than Hank Aaron hit home runs.

933
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:23.840
Could you do me a favor on my 800th birthday?

934
00:55:23.841 --> 00:55:26.390
I know what I want.
Okay.

935
00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.960
Could you just choke me to death?
Please

936
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:34.720
does not compute.
You know,
you just,

937
00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:37.880
they won't kill you and then you're fucking,

938
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:42.490
your punishment is that you live forever.
You know,

939
00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:46.210
you kind of like a vampire at that point cause you can kind of seduce any woman

940
00:55:46.211 --> 00:55:49.480
you want because they're all going to be,
you know,

941
00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.450
you just going to get,
but you know what?

942
00:55:52.451 --> 00:55:56.710
I bet after a while if you live long enough,
he just start banging.
You'd have,

943
00:55:56.711 --> 00:56:01.711
you'd make like ugly chick robots and he just banged them cause he was so sick

944
00:56:01.901 --> 00:56:06.120
of bang and tense.
I mean it's a fucking,
it's a hell of a,
God damn it.

945
00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:09.250
I don't think human beings can survive in that.

946
00:56:09.251 --> 00:56:11.740
Just you just think of all the shit that that's going to app.

947
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:14.380
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

948
00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:17.090
<v 1>All right.
Female Comedians.
What the fuck is this?</v>

949
00:56:17.091 --> 00:56:20.870
I didn't know this was coming up.
All right.
Hey Baby Daddy,

950
00:56:20.871 --> 00:56:22.820
Billy boy emailing from Dublin.

951
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.090
A big fan of the podcast is standup.

952
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:30.400
I've been watching a lot of standup specials over the last month.

953
00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:35.850
Recently I'm making a concentrated effort to watch female comedians because all

954
00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.250
the Comedians,
I'm a fan of our men.

955
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:43.660
Unfortunately I've struggled to find many who meet the mark.

956
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:48.580
I just watched so-and-so's Netflix special,
which was hilarious.
Okay,

957
00:56:48.581 --> 00:56:50.480
then I'm going to say the name Kathleen Madigan.
Yeah.

958
00:56:50.481 --> 00:56:54.250
She's the fucking real deal and she's a total hot shit.
I love her.

959
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:58.480
She's been fucking crushing it since,
since I started.

960
00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:03.580
Um,
English comedian Joe Brand was also excellent,

961
00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:05.170
although I dunno if she's,

962
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:10.230
she's still active beyond all the others I've seen.

963
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:14.770
All the others had been shit in my opinion.
Uh,

964
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.550
my issue with this disparities that I don't think men are funnier than women in

965
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:20.950
general.
The women in my life,
like my girlfriend,

966
00:57:20.951 --> 00:57:24.430
my sister and friends are just as funny as my guy.
Friends.
In your experience,

967
00:57:24.431 --> 00:57:28.480
which you find male comedians funnier like myself,
if so,

968
00:57:28.481 --> 00:57:30.250
why do you believe this is the case?

969
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:33.790
Could it be the fact that the industry is so male heavy?

970
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.960
Our women comedians trying too hard to emulate their male counterparts?

971
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.830
These are all questions I can't answer.
I don't fuck it.

972
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:45.210
I don't know what the deal is.
Again,
it's all your opinion.
Um,

973
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:46.900
maybe I'm just an ignorant prick,

974
00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:50.620
but I feel like there's a female perspective and comedy that would speak to me

975
00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:55.570
that isn't met by the better known female comedians.
Either way.

976
00:57:55.571 --> 00:57:57.610
Thanks for the laughs.
Congrats to you.

977
00:57:57.611 --> 00:58:01.900
And the lovely Nia on the little baby bird.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

978
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.930
I dunno dude.
It's like,
you know,
you know what it is.

979
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.220
I just think it's like bands.

980
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.650
You're into a certain style of music and the other shit does it speak to you?

981
00:58:09.651 --> 00:58:14.380
See,
you don't,
you don't go to that.
But every once in a while there's a band,

982
00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:17.830
you know?
Oh fuck.
I didn't think I liked country music.
I like this country music.

983
00:58:17.831 --> 00:58:21.300
I just think,
uh,
I don't,
I don't know what the deal is.

984
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:26.740
I don't know why there's so much of that fucking talk.
My Shit is this okay?

985
00:58:26.741 --> 00:58:30.850
If you'll fucking funny.
You're funny.
If you're not funny,

986
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:36.160
you're not funny.
Okay.
And it's not the crowds fault.
It's not this,

987
00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:39.370
it's not the fucking Martians.
It's you're not funny.

988
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.270
And one of the things I've found with people,

989
00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:48.271
male and female who aren't funny is they fucking got every God damn excuse in

990
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:50.780
the book.
And I just want to say,
hey,

991
00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.540
just go onstage and fucking kill and all your problems will be solved.

992
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.450
Go on stage and fucking killed.
That's what it was.
You know,

993
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.390
that's what it's always been.
If you do that,

994
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:10.930
all of these fucking issues at everybody all,
there's this over here,

995
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:14.950
there's that over here,
there's a fucking liberal bias does all of this.

996
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.460
It's all fucking bullshit.
If you go on stage and you fucking kill,

997
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:23.650
you're going to get work.
That's it.
That's it.
So I don't,
I dunno,

998
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:28.720
whatever.
I'm so fucking sick of all,
all of that.
Uh,
you know,

999
00:59:28.721 --> 00:59:32.470
our women funny I Blah Blah Blah.
And so just lump everybody into a group.

1000
00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:38.280
I is more just ask me,
do you,
do you think Kathleen Madigan's funny.

1001
00:59:38.281 --> 00:59:40.950
Just ask me that in that email.
I think she's fucking hilarious.

1002
00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.800
I love her delivery and you know what I love about her?

1003
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.900
She can just stand there and be funny.

1004
00:59:45.901 --> 00:59:48.390
I got to jump around and scream and yell at shit out.

1005
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.650
She could just stand there and fucking murder for an hour.

1006
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:55.110
And you know what's great too is you meet her and she's totally down to earth

1007
00:59:55.111 --> 00:59:56.730
and she's fucking awesome.
So there you go.

1008
00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.330
That's the positive way of me getting out of that type of shit cause I'm not

1009
01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:01.800
walking into that like,

1010
01:00:01.801 --> 01:00:05.850
what the fuck do you think I would answer any of that shit?
You know what I mean?

1011
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.660
Look what business are you win.
Okay.

1012
01:00:09.661 --> 01:00:13.710
Why don't you shit on some people and you're fucking,
you're fucking arena.

1013
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:17.580
I don't want to do that.
That's cannibalistic.
Um,

1014
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:22.660
oh my God.

<v 1>I loved your new special.
I need some advice.</v>

1023
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.540
I'm a young guy and I haven't even tried to get into a relationship and a few

1024
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:54.710
years because my last one turned into a fucking nightmare.
Anyways,

1025
01:00:54.711 --> 01:00:56.210
over the past year,

1026
01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:01.670
I've been hanging out with this lesbian and we've grown close.
Oh,

1027
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:06.350

1028
01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:11.790

You're chasing the chasing leads that aren't even there.

1029
01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:14.160
She's amazing.
And my best friend,

1030
01:01:14.161 --> 01:01:18.750
the problem is I find myself growing more and more attracted toward by the day

1031
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.820
we've talked about having a threesome.

1032
01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:22.540
<v 2>Ooh.</v>

1033
01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.670
<v 1>Which makes me think she might want to fuck me,</v>

1034
01:01:24.671 --> 01:01:29.440
but doesn't want to admit it to herself.
Oh,
strike everything that I just said.

1035
01:01:29.441 --> 01:01:34.270
Dude,

you have fucking walked into paradise.
I am happy for you,

1036
01:01:34.271 --> 01:01:38.770

God bless you.

1037
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.410
I hope this fucking turns out the way I think it's going to.

1038
01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:45.220
I'm so you did just made the rest of my day that someone's in this situation

1039
01:01:45.221 --> 01:01:46.054

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

<v 1>Lately she's been trying to get me a girlfriend probably.</v>

1042
01:01:50.971 --> 01:01:55.350
So there's sexual tension can be redirected.

She's never going to be on again.

1072
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:38.460
Now my daughter's developing,
eventually she'll be playing with toys.

1073
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:41.200
She can sneak in there and then she can,
she can answer some goddamn questions.

1074
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:44.130
All right.
There you go.

As long as there's a,
you know,
