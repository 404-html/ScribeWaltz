1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.100
All right.
Hey,
what's going on everybody?

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:05.880
It's bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.140
Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you.

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.200
I'm just checking in on your week here.
And uh,
usually,
you know,

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.580
what do I usually do?
I usually sit here in my fucking pajamas.
I fucking,

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.200
you know,
give you a little half hour fucking bullshit to 12.
But it's payday,

7
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:23.490
right?
You don't need a full show.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.790
You had probably half in the bag and a fucking El Torito at this point.

9
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.860
If you listen to it,
you shouldn't be driving.

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.230
But every once in awhile I do have a guest.

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.030
I do have a guest and today we have the Great Joe Rogan.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.460
Hey fucking,
uh,

13
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.830
grand national champion at Taekwondo Sitcoms,

14
00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:46.740
Star fucking reality show.
A commentator right across the board.

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.260
L Conner,
wild boar hunter.

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.620
I don't know what I fucking conspiracy theory.
Fucking whatever you want.

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.641
This guy,

18
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:01.641
he's his own fucking entity and he has a brand new killer special on Netflix

19
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.760
entitled triggered.
Please welcome Joe Rogan.
Thanks Bill Burns going on.

20
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:09.330
Long time coming through.
I know last time coming,
I'd love your show.

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.390
I have lunch one on mine a bunch of times,
so I know to be on yours,

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.520
but you're a big like interview guy.
I'm,

23
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:18.270
I'm like a fucking lunatic who just sits in the corner of his house and every

24
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:22.080
once in a while my wife walks by and I love the style that you do cause it's

25
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.220
very unique.
You know,

26
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.070
I've done a couple like that where answer questions and stuff like that,

27
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.960
but it's a very unique style of,
you know,

28
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
I think it lends itself really well to stand up and to developing bits too.

29
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.700
I just didn't want to deal with having to like book.
Like you're fine,

30
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:39.090
you're simple.
You okay,
come down to my studio.
Perfect.
You know what I mean?

31
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.810
But like I just didn't want it.
I saw what other people were going through.
Like,

32
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.080
oh,
I got an audition,
can we make it four o'clock?
And I was just like,

33
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:50.530
I don't want to fucking deal with that stuff.
But,
um,
um,
but when I,
if you know,

34
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.480
if everyone could be a guest like yourself,
can I start with the elk thing?
Yeah.

35
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.130
Because I am fascinated with hunting.
I think it's bad ass.

36
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.940
I think everybody should know how to do it.
And in,
I'm not one of the,

37
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:04.080
I am an animal lover,

38
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.800
but I'm not going to be that hypocritical one that fucking eats chickens.

39
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:10.350
Then had the fucking beaks clipped off and they got the,

40
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:14.700
the roided out Mark McGuire breast plate and the tipping over the coops,

41
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.900
all that shit that you see.
And then I'm going to be like,
Ooh,

42
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.670
could you shoot a fucking pheasant or whatever the hell you're shooting out

43
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:25.560
there.
But,
um,
you,
I retweeted a picture of you got this.
What does it,

44
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:29.010
you said it was a 12 point or why don't you say six?
It's a six by six.

45
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:33.060
They call it a straight six.
It's a six by six.

46
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:35.910
So I said it means a big elk.
That was the,
I've shot three hours.

47
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.850
That's the biggest one by far there.
And one was monsters.
It was huge.

48
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.440
So what is the,
uh,

49
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.210
this is the thing that always fascinates me about hunting shows is the

50
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.500
nervousness and the whispering.
Before you take the shot though,
it's like,
okay,

51
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:54.300
there it is.
Relax,
exhale.
And just like,
if you miss,
I mean,

52
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:56.610
it's the fucking thing going to come running at,
you know,

53
00:02:56.611 --> 00:03:00.040
it seems like because it doesn't,
I not to spook it because you have to have it

54
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 1>close enough for you to shoot it.
Depending upon how you shooting it.</v>

55
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.110
If you shouldn't it with a bow and Arrow,
you gotta be real close.

56
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.660
You've got to be inside of 60 yards.
[inaudible] bad ass.

57
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.090
I shot one with the bow and arrow.
That one out there,

58
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:14.440
the big one I shot with a rifle dude,
a bow and arrow.
That's,
that's to me,

59
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:19.050
that's the Shit I saw Ted Nugent.
He shot a fucking bear,
you know,

60
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.790
which I could never do.
I fucking love bears is certain animals.

61
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.180
But you know what I mean?
Bears are interesting.
I've,
I've,
I've shot bears.

62
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.630
You shut up.
So I'll get you some bare sausage.
I can't eat bear.

63
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.390
I've shot three bears and I can't eat a bad,
the good.

64
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.020
And I knew about fares.
Delicious.

65
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.940
You're like a fucking sirloin.
Well,
we,
uh,

66
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.990
Philemon young got no tender and juicy.
Um,

67
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.080
I've always felt that about you,
Joe.
Thank you.
We think of bears,

68
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.090
I think very incorrectly because would the,

69
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.510
you know what the word a anthropomorphization means when you put human

70
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.120
characteristics and animals like Yogi bear and shit like that,

71
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.130
when you make them ride a bicycle at the circus,

72
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.800
we have this idea that bears are these cute things.

73
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.470
But where my friend lives in Alberta where I hunt,

74
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.050
they literally have to shoot them because they don't have any predators.

75
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:06.400
So bears don't have any predators.

76
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.520
And they just breed and the keep reading and then they decimate the Moose

77
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:13.120
population,
the elk population,
and they cannibalize each other.

78
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.870
That's the thing that most people,
they kind of handle it in house sort of,

79
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.190
but they eat babies.
That's what they do most of the time.
Eat Babies.

80
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:22.480
They eat their own babies.
The Chi of sliders,

81
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.630
black bear sliders.
Well,
why wouldn't you?
Well,
it's,

82
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:30.370
it's brutal to see,
you know,
we've,

83
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:35.371
we've stumbled across pause and stuff from a cubs with a male bores the double

84
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.771
though.

85
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:40.771
That's what the ones that when you just find a baby bear paw in the woods,

86
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.880
I mean the a party,
his soul has to just fucking die or cry out.
Like I,

87
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.450
that's something I never want to see.
It's very strange.

88
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.780
I guess I do have to admit though that uh,
bear hunting's not,

89
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.090
I don't like it as much as hunting other animals.

90
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.900
If I had to choose like what animal's tongue,
you can eat bear by the way.

91
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:02.240
And that's the only things that I hunt is what I eat.
Black bear.
Uh,

92
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.270
you can eat grizzly bear,
but they don't taste good.

93
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.440
Most of the reason for that because grizzly bears mostly eat meat.

94
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.300
They eat a few berries.

95
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.520
If you can find a grizzly bear that was just eating berries,

96
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.250
it would probably taste delicious.
They literally tastes like what they eat.

97
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.330
Like hunters tried to go after bears eat berries like a black bears in

98
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:23.080
particular in the fall they'll eat blueberries.
They called them blueberry bears.

99
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.520
Cause like as you were opening them up,

100
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:28.450
their fat is like a purple color and it tastes like blueberries and apparently

101
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:29.920
it's the most delicious meat in the world.

102
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.370
So without them realizing that they're already marinating themselves.
Exactly.

103
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:36.040
You guys wow.
Seasoning themselves.

104
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.150
But my all time favorite animals are elk.
That's,
that's the best.

105
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:44.560
They taste the best,
the best for you.
And uh,
he gave me that,

106
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.200
that elk meat,
uh,

107
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.170
whatever the last time I was on here and I made a chili out of it and then the

108
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:52.180
fucking elk burgers,
it's a little dry.

109
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.710
Somebody gave me a hint to put a little bit of butter in there to Kinda,

110
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.660
you know.
Yes.

111
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.670
You needed something like an egg or something to make it stick together a little

112
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:01.280
bit.
You don't want it to cook it too much cause it's super lean.

113
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.480
There's no fat in it.
No.

114
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:07.340
I put a piece of Swiss cheese and some per shoot on top of the fucking insane a

115
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.340
feel good when you eat it too.
It's a powerful food.

116
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.940
There's a lot of energy in those.
There's like there's,

117
00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:16.250
there's so much nutrients in elk.
It's like way more protein dense,

118
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.070
way more nutrient dense.
That's thing kind of like the quick,

119
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:23.360
because they're wild.
I know like the human like footprint as they said,

120
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.170
you know acid rain and all the fucking horse should we do but at least it's,

121
00:06:26.171 --> 00:06:29.570
it's,
I would like to think it's kind of a way from the Gmos and all that.

122
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.400
It's a type of stuff you can get.

123
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:35.750
So who knows what do to you but like the fresh shit tastes better though.

124
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.960
It does taste.
Does it taste better?
I mean Gmos,
everything's gene.

125
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.260
That's a weird word.
Like if you talk to real scientists about Gmos,

126
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.230
most of the time when you talk about Gmos,

127
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:47.330
we're talking to hippies and like you man,
you're got to stay away from Gmos.

128
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.990
Genetically Modified.
It's giving us cancer.
It's terrible for the water.

129
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.690
But real GMOs is almost everything we eat.

130
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.430
Every tomato you eat is genetically modified.
They've all been all 12 corn.

131
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.760
We kind of were kind of like Guinea pigs to see like what,

132
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.810
what's going to happen sort of.
But most of it is just splicing.

133
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.590
Like I just found this out recently.
You know when you buy pistachios,

134
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:10.080
there's a place up in northern California.
Was it Staci was a stash.

135
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.250
It goes either way.
And she's asked you who you talking to?

136
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.030
Sam Regal onto the thank you staff.
She has

137
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.730
his stash.
Yeah,
I like it with tea shelled.
Of course.
I don't Sheldon I,

138
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:23.820
so I,

139
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.840
I buy shelled pistachios and I feel like I'm cheating because I just take big

140
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:29.450
handfuls of them shoving my fat face.
You can't do that.

141
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.750
There's a reason why there's a shell on it because if you,
if you don't,

142
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:35.690
you're going to eat a thousand of them.
I buy them in these big,
uh,

143
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.700
like a two pound boxes and I just pour my hands and I eat them.
The good,

144
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.460
good for you too.
It's kind of guilt free,
but you feel like you're cheating.

145
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.910
Like you don't have to crack them.
I know I stared you off course.

146
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:50.960
So he was so native when they grow these pistachios,
pistachio trees,

147
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.170
the pistachio bushes are not a big strong tree.

148
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.290
So they graft the limbs of the pistachio tree onto like an avocado tree,

149
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.370
a thicker,
stronger tree,
and they grow pistachios on an avocado tree.

150
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.080
Like what the fuck?
But you'll,

151
00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:12.081
how are we playing God when we're playing God but driving cars to replay on God

152
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:16.370
by flying planes.
That shit is like,
first of all,

153
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.220
I thought pistachios came from the ground.
I thought penis went in the ground.

154
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.270
Peanuts,
I think peanuts are in the ground is a pistachio.
None of the,

155
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.780
it wasn't George W was the,
Jimmy Carter was a peanut farmer.
How did he do it?

156
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.670
Should I ask him?
I think it was in the ground.
I don't know.
Fucking okay.

157
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.720
That's why I want to hunt.
Carrots are in the ground and just say,
oh,
worms.

158
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.840
They were in the ground.
Do you grow?

159
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.800
And he's trying to recover it that we don't know any shit.

160
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.070
Worms are in the ground.
Birds are in this guy dirt.

161
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.670
Um,
do I know?
I mean my,
my,
my,

162
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.330
the guy who cuts the grass fucking put him on.
So I got tomatoes,

163
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:51.560
I got lemons and limes.

164
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.590
But all that did was just make me fucking like booze more.
Cause I'm just,

165
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.160
I get totally

166
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.460
<v 0>got into Kipp Tequila.
It's like there's only so much guacamole you can eat.</v>

167
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.070
You just like,
what the fuck else can I do with this shit?
Um,

168
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.190
so I kinda got into Tequila.
It's less of a hangover and do,
and I'm telling you,

169
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:09.000
you get what it was big square ice cubes.

170
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.550
A really nice to keep just like a patrol and silvery,

171
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.370
put that in there and then you go pick a fucking lime off.
I'm telling you,

172
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:19.260
it's why it's why I live out here.
It's not the show Biz.
It's the booze.

173
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.540
Well,
you don't really have to live out here anymore.
Right.

174
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:25.500
And especially like your podcast,
the way you do your podcast,
you just rant.

175
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.640
Like you could do that fucking thing and you do do it anyway.
But I also,
uh,

176
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.600
you know,
my wife's in the business too,
so she does acting.
She just,

177
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:36.120
he's doing a voiceover today and uh,
so she doesn't have that luxury.

178
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:39.510
And then also,
you know,
um,
she would go,

179
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.940
she would go crazy if,
if I,
if I,
you know,

180
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.480
if I just moved to like the middle of fucking now I saying and lived in the

181
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:48.030
middle of fucking nowhere,
but I do,
when I go on the road,

182
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.620
I always have that urge.

183
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.880
Like when I go to a place and I just start thinking about,
hey man,

184
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:56.610
these guys riding around motorcycles,
no helmets on,
and it's just like this,

185
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.170
that lake water here they got,
they got,
they got that.

186
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.730
It's very lush land.
Like living out here is,
is a,
it's terrifying.

187
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.020
It's terrifying.
Like what,
what happened to the water and silver lake?

188
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:13.080
Where did they take that?
They closed silver lake and actual lake at one point.

189
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:15.780
Yeah.
I mean it was man made,
but the water's all gone now.

190
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.660
They're going to develop it.
And Dad,
they said they put an underground,

191
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.040
they didn't really say where.
It's just,
it's just gone.
Yeah.
Do what I,
I fly.

192
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:23.360
That's like,

193
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.270
it's one of the things I fucker would look down and you go over at dodger

194
00:10:25.271 --> 00:10:26.340
stadium and then you start coming.

195
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.380
Then you see silver lake and I'm looking down like where'd that parking lot with

196
00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:32.420
the big top come from?
And the guy was like,
oh that was silver lake.

197
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:35.340
And they drained the water.
I don't know.
They said they put it under ground.

198
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.670
It's all vague there.
Do you know when I was in,

199
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.900
I was in Nashville this past weekend and I was sitting there watching the news

200
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:46.440
during the day and they just go like,
Oh,
and folks,

201
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:51.210
if you're in the downtown area and you see the police doing something that seems

202
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:55.200
a little disturbing.
Ah,
don't worry.
It's just an exercise.

203
00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.150
And then they continued on and it was just like you didn't do any followup like,

204
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.490
or there's no more information with an exercise.

205
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.140
What are they practicing for that whatever they're doing is,
is like scary.

206
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.000
Now I'm not saying they're going to come at us.

207
00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.970
Is it some sort of anti terrorism thing?
I have no fucking idea what it was.

208
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:12.804
But like just the,

209
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.880
the kind of vagueness that two hammock right before the Dodgers score the other

210
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.650
day,
uh,
NPR,
my wife listens to that shit and I,
you know,

211
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.970
and NPR morning becomes eclectic if you enjoy this show.

212
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.200
Fresh air with Terry Gross.
Yeah.

213
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.380
There's always those pauses and know when you first started doing stand,

214
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.410
do you know when I think of,
of discussed this before,
but it's kind of important,

215
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:37.770
you know what to think of when I think of those people.

216
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.290
Do you know who that Guy John Ghomeshi hands?
I like NPR,

217
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:42.440
but it's so easily to be made fun of.
It's,

218
00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:45.120
it's easy to drive off the road into a fucking tree when you're listening to it,

219
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.600
to you.
Oh yeah.
Now there's a lot of uh,
droning on,

220
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.980
but that talk,
which nobody does,
that really super sensitive

221
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.970
<v 1>leftwing style of talk.
The guys that was a,
he do that really well.</v>

222
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:00.820
The main guy that did that was this Guy John Ghomeshi,

223
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.850
who was on CBC in Canada and it turned out he liked to beat the fuck out of

224
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:10.030
girls when he was having sex with them.
He would punch him in the face and club.

225
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:14.380
I'm in the head and it was crazy shit.
And one girl I aim at.
Yeah,
yeah.

226
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.840
Want and he would do it without asking them.
It was like,
you know,

227
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:20.800
like that's a strong move.
Pretty strong move in the rack.

228
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.530
Well I mean who knows what to tell you the truth because he was kind of

229
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:26.440
acquitted of a lot of it.
It was,
cause it was,

230
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.620
it was very difficult to find some money to get acquitted,
you know.

231
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.480
Well that's true.
That's a good point.

232
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:34.870
But he was fired and there was a gang of girls that came out and said he used to

233
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:38.620
pick them up.
Oh wait,
wait,
wait,
wait that the Gao does the interviews.

234
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.620
He talks like this bill burrs.

235
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:45.190
So tell me one time when,
I'm not saying all of,

236
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.050
I don't know what the fuck he does in his personal life,

237
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:50.830
but a Russell Peters was on there and he just goes like,
and he's like,
Russell,

238
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.440
you have nine cars.
And Russell's like,
yeah.
And he goes,
why?

239
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.270
And it just fucking like making him feel bad cause he's doing well.
He's,

240
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.611
you know,

241
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:04.210
and then Russell had to fucking basically justified and come up with money and

242
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:08.440
now I can have it.
I'm sorry I fucking made it.
Wow.
And I like cars.

243
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.520
Wow.
Yeah.
It's so quiet.
No,

244
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.560
I'm not saying he's a Twat that's just saying this right there.

245
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.940
Well even if they're that bug me,
I hate when people fucking do stuff like that.

246
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.770
Had to hit somebody.
If you get like eight or nine chicks,

247
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:22.660
they're saying you beat the fuck out of my way.
You're having sex.

248
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.060
Even if you get off what somebody got cracked,

249
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.500
what is your number that innocent until guilty or how many accusations?

250
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.500
Bill Cosby I gave in around 30 30

251
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.060
I heard the first house,
but we had heard that right out around seven.

252
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.280
No,
I,
there was rumors of his infidelity,
but I never heard of.

253
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.320
You never heard that?
No,
I did.
I heard that.
I had heard that it was like a rumor.

254
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:54.280
It was a rumor that he would drug women.
It was a rumor a long time ago.
He was a,

255
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:58.810
there was a court case that is part of this case from,

256
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.610
I believe it was like 2005 and that was one of the reasons why they weren't

257
00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:07.750
allowed to admit that evidence because the judge had made a decision that if he

258
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:11.470
paid this woman off,
then it couldn't be admissible in a future trial.

259
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.440
But it was all verbal.
They didn't get anything on paper.

260
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.780
So once they found out that it didn't get this on paper,
they're like,
well,

261
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:17.860
we're going to admit this.

262
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:21.130
And then the woman came out and then he sued the woman that he gave the money to

263
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.870
for drug runner.
Oh,
the whole thing is very,
very sorted.
But with Bill Cosby,

264
00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:29.170
I think it's up to like 50 or something crazy.
Yeah.
So you've got to wonder,

265
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:32.800
out of those 50 there's probably like 12 that are just crazy like he dragged me

266
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.390
to,
but the fact,

267
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.520
but the fact that he'd still be open 30 it's just nuts.
You know?

268
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.290
It was one when all that shit came out about Trump,
right.
He did this,

269
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:47.740
he did that,
blah,
blah,
blah.
It was all pretty pedestrian sorta of like,
oh,

270
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:52.310
he grabbed my boob and then took me in the back.
Just just really generic sort

271
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.630
<v 0>of lights become sort of the cliched story.
And then this one woman saw,</v>

272
00:14:55.631 --> 00:14:58.070
I'm sitting there going like,
guide,
the Clintons are fucking filthy.

273
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.890
Who knows if they paid these people?
Who knows what the fuck's going on?

274
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:04.880
It's right before the gist of when this is coming out.
And so I was going,

275
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:06.920
all right,
we'll see,
we'll see.
And then this finally,

276
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:09.020
this woman came on and she goes,
uh,

277
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:14.210
so he made advancements at me and she goes,
I just pushed him away and said,

278
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:17.840
get real.
Which is the perfect end to say,
cause you're,
you're in your 20s.

279
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:22.070
He's like fucking 106 it's like,
yeah,
you serious?
So she goes,
I said,
get real.

280
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:26.900
And then she said he trusted his genitals towards me and and said,

281
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.310
yeah,

282
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.270
<v 1>get re.
Yeah,
she said that.
And the way she imitated them,</v>

283
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.380
I was in the car with my wife.
I say he fucking did that.
Did that one.

284
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.880
There's no fucking way that he's just too specific.

285
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.300
Like I got the creek like you real.

286
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.280
So the logistics are where the legality is rather of the,
the audio tape.

287
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.680
Like if you don't know you're being recorded,

288
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.170
like you know you're being recorded for a show.

289
00:15:53.171 --> 00:15:55.690
You weren't a microphone but you don't know you're being recorded while you on a

290
00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:59.200
bus and you're talking about grabbing them by the pussy and all that.

291
00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:02.060
Steve was talking to me.
He's talking shit.
Yeah,

292
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:06.010
like it's like Joey Diaz would say something like that and I'd be fucking
crying,

293
00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:09.190
laughing and he would be egging it up.
He would ramp it up.

294
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.950
He would make it way exaggerated because he knows it's funny,

295
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.570
he's gone for the left.
If you're sitting next to Trump and he's like,

296
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:16.960
I just grab them by the Pussy.
You'd be fucking crying laughing.

297
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.570
<v 0>That's why I really push,
I defended him on my podcast like it.
Like,</v>

298
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.420
I'm not saying that guy's a great guy,
but if fire of fucking guy,

299
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.580
because of a fucking 22nd clip from 11 years ago,
what's he supposed to do?

300
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.760
He's interviewing the guy and what you're supposed to do was keep the interview

301
00:16:32.761 --> 00:16:34.800
or happiness the interviewee happy.

302
00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:37.510
So he's at grand by the pussy grabbing by the pussy.
Yeah.

303
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:40.600
He doesn't even say anything bad.
Billy Bush didn't say anything bad.
It just,

304
00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.320
this guy at work said,
well when he said to the woman,
go over and give him a hug,

305
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.320
he became part of the sexual assault and I was just like,

306
00:16:49.321 --> 00:16:51.870
what sector was no sexual assault?
What they were saying,

307
00:16:51.871 --> 00:16:56.871
if he actually did it was the whole thing was just like this,

308
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:57.631
just,
you know,

309
00:16:57.631 --> 00:17:01.680
I understand when we getting flipping out about it as far as obviously just the

310
00:17:01.681 --> 00:17:03.960
whole,
it would be them,
but yeah,

311
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.560
but they don't know is the way guys talk when they're not there yet.

312
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.540
And I'm just,
I'm going to sit and do the fucking shit that we've said

313
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.340
<v 1>we eat and we say it for fun.</v>

314
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.880
You don't say it because we really want to go grab someone by the Pussy and pick

315
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:19.460
them up like a bowling ball and say it because it's funny.

316
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:23.030
It's funny and you just,
you're talking completely ridiculous.
And inappropriate.

317
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.910
Yes.
Yeah.

318
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.010
<v 0>Say if you do have $1 billion,</v>

319
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:32.390
I what I'm learning through Cosby and all these fucking guys is evidently you

320
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:33.230
can do that.

321
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.350
<v 1>And he did say that he's going like,
you get famous enough,</v>

322
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.210
you can just walk up and grab them by the Pussy.

323
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:41.330
And I've just said it was just so absurd to me.
I'm like,
you can do that.

324
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:44.480
You can't do that.
But he's got so much money.

325
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.810
You got to think when you get off that that guy could get you six grand in cash

326
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:50.160
if he,
I just don't correct.

327
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.430
<v 0>I think he's leveraged out totally,</v>

328
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.570
but I'm pretty sure he'd go to the ATM and get six grand.

329
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.060
But I know you're exaggerating.
Two six brands of funny number.

330
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.560
It's a funny number.
It is funny,
right?
I'm just saying like,
dude,

331
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:05.880
it is like liquid rich and your assets have paid off.
And then there's,

332
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.840
oh,
I got this,

333
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:09.360
I'm going to take a loan against this and then I'm going to do that and get some

334
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:12.900
investors here and then I'm gonna stick my fucking name on it to build my brand.

335
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.610
There's that way where you're sort of like steroid and up your value,

336
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.070
but at the end of the day it's like,
all right,
but what?

337
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.540
How much can you get me right fucking now?
Like I don't get that whole like,

338
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:28.390
well all my shit's tied up.
Right.
And I got other guys,
you know I'm,

339
00:18:28.391 --> 00:18:30.870
I'm working with,
let me see the Zeros.
What's in your bank account?

340
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:34.620
Show me your phone.
Yes.
Sean helicopter.
The helicopter.
The name on the back.

341
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:38.040
Has that paid off?
Is that a sticker?

342
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.930
Is that a sticker that they take off?

343
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:42.090
And then they put fucking Mark Cuban on the back,

344
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.120
but name woman showing up at his house and you're having,

345
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:47.970
you're supposed to have a business lunch.
You don't know that you,
you show up.

346
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:51.300
He's got this sprawling estate that looks like a castle.

347
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.790
He's got these enormous grounds.

348
00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:56.730
He's probably got 50 people working just at his house cause people be greeting

349
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:00.150
you.
They're taking you into these rooms.
He comes out in a $10,000 suit,

350
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.660
he's got diamonds and Rolexes and everything's beautiful and you're like,

351
00:19:03.661 --> 00:19:07.210
Holy Shit.
Donald Trump,
his two pays like 80 grant.

352
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.360
What is this fucking hair?

353
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:13.140
Why doesn't he go the way you and I did you and I recognize it was over because

354
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:15.570
I don't think it was acceptable back then,
but it's,

355
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:18.090
except Jordan had to make it acceptable.
Jordan made it,

356
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:20.130
except maybe except a full black eyes.

357
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.360
He transcended curly Neal of the globe trotters.

358
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.350
It's made it acceptable for black guys.
And Brian Jordan was just,
you know,

359
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.180
everyone wanted to be like Mike and then I have,
when he was at the height,

360
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:37.110
those black guys young with the full head fucking hair would shave their head

361
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:39.730
just to look like those fucking insane.
They'll do that.

362
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.100
But what about Yule Brenner?

363
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.580
Yule Brenner was the first white guy to rocket and be a movie star.
Oh yeah.

364
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.040
The king and I.
Westworld,
the original Westworld,
not the HBO series.
You know,

365
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.040
I tried to buy the rights to that like fucking 10 years ago.
You did?
Yes.
World.

366
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.530
Yeah.
I don't know what I was going to buy.
I was just like,

367
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:58.980
this is a movie that someone's going to want to Redo because they were redoing

368
00:19:58.981 --> 00:20:01.740
all these movies from my childhood.
And I was just like,

369
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:02.940
I fucking love that movie.

370
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:06.480
And the thing really loans itself because we're not at the point where you can

371
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:10.350
do any of this shit.
So it's still in the future.
You could totally,
but then,

372
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:11.820
but they wanted like a zillion dollars for,

373
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:13.530
I didn't realize it was Michael Crighton book and all that.

374
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:15.600
They wanted like millions and millions and I was just like,
all right,

375
00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.250
I don't know.
I don't get a a like fucking 30 grand,
like a Prius.
Um,

376
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.840
have you watched the show?
Or this is thing.

377
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.060
Then the second I sat down and I watched the show,

378
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:26.790
I just watched the opening credits and I was like,
oh,
thank God,

379
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.230
thank God I didn't have the rights to that cause there's no fucking way I could

380
00:20:29.231 --> 00:20:29.971
have pulled that off.

381
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:33.710
Like all the things like the horse running and those tendons connecting.
Um,

382
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.290
I've watched the first two episodes.
I'm totally in and,
uh,

383
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.710
I've already bugged my agent to be like,
dude,
I will fucking,

384
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.240
the same way when I saw breaking bad,

385
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:44.880
I just feel like I watched the first two episodes and I was like,
dude,

386
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:47.710
I will carry a tray of math in the background.
Whatever you can fucking do.

387
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.720
So I bugged him going like,
um,

388
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.020
I'm actually bullshitting that's on my agenda today.

389
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:55.120
I'm going to want to get out of this when we're done here.

390
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.900
And I walk home with my elk meat,
hopefully.
Um,
I've got pounds for it.

391
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.440
I'm going to,
uh,
I'm going to,
uh,
I'm going to bug him about trying,

392
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.020
trying to get on that thing.
And uh,
there's actually,

393
00:21:05.021 --> 00:21:09.670
there's a couple of actors in there that I,
I've worked with,
um,
that,
uh,

394
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.160
I'm just psyched that they're on,
you know,
you see,

395
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.190
you see friends of yours that are actually in there and they're on something

396
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:19.720
that's fucking cool tape.
My friend Tate was on last week's episode.
Yes,
world.

397
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:24.040
He's on everything though.
Tate's Tate's been in,
I dunno,
a hundred movies,

398
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:27.850
probably easily a hundred movies have always wondered if you know,
when you're,

399
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.930
you're doing something great cause it's so hard when you're shooting it and how

400
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:32.750
they just,

401
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.770
all right now his point of view would do the master of backpack back and do all

402
00:21:35.771 --> 00:21:38.010
that type of stuff you need.
You just find yourself walking around it.

403
00:21:38.011 --> 00:21:41.110
Was it good?
Did it,
it was a camera crew's not saying anything.

404
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:45.020
Everybody's fucking quiet.
And it's uh,
it really comes down though to,

405
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.170
to the editors in the music and all that.

406
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.890
They can either take it to the next level or they can relate and make something

407
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:53.950
good look great and they can take something great look fucking horrific.
Well,

408
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:56.780
something started off great and then they don't know how to end it and they fuck

409
00:21:56.781 --> 00:21:57.250
it up.

410
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.910
But there's something weird about having a friend in a movie where you go and

411
00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:03.490
this movie is Great.
Oh there's Tate like takes you out of it.
It's like,

412
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:05.980
oh that's my friend.
Like this movie's bullshit.
Yeah.

413
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:09.570
People always say it doesn't,
it doesn't,
it doesn't take me,

414
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.690
it doesn't take me out of it unless I see them like watching themselves.

415
00:22:13.691 --> 00:22:15.310
Like I can't believe I'm in this scene with this guy.

416
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.770
Then then it like pulls me out.
But like I,
I,
I buy in when I'm one of those guys,

417
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:24.310
like I don't like going to horror movies.
Like they freak me out.
I buy in,

418
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.500
I don't give a fuck what the concept is.

419
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.580
Like that fucking thing where the lady was like flipping the light switch off

420
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.300
and then turn it on and on and then flipped it off and saw the thing again and

421
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:37.260
then turn it on and then flipped off.
It was right there.
I was literally at home.

422
00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:42.040
I stopped fucking turning.
Well,
movies that,

423
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.581
I dunno,

424
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:45.430
like the movie was coming out and it was like the thing where she's like,

425
00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.650
she's like,
you know when you look into a room and you shut the lights off,

426
00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:50.410
shuts the lights off and all of a sudden it's this fucking thing there.

427
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.590
Sort of a girl sort of fucking Beasley and it's across the room.

428
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.530
So you can't quite see it.
It's just like,
what the fuck is that?

429
00:22:56.531 --> 00:23:00.550
Turns the lights on.
It's gone.
Shuts it off.
It's there again.
Same spot.

430
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.250
Turns the lights back on.
It's not there.

431
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.150
Shuts it off the third time and it's right in her fucking grill.
Yeah.

432
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.090
Scared the fuck out of me.
Blair witch,
Blair witch.

433
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:12.490
When they would go through to move,
you didn't skim and Ralphie may go,
no,

434
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.780
they didn't fucking scared the shit out of me.
I saw that movie by myself.

435
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.680
I'd done a spot at the laugh factory and went down to the Mann's Chinese theater

436
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:22.150
though,
the one that got Hollywood galaxy.

437
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:24.670
I don't know if that's still there anymore.
Right next door.

438
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.430
And I saw like the midnight showing by myself.

439
00:23:27.431 --> 00:23:30.880
Dude freaked those dinner.
Yeah,

440
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:33.160
but nobody I knew when it was like really sort of like,

441
00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:35.800
there wasn't a lot of people there and then that walked through the parking

442
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:39.120
garage.
Oh Dude,
I was fucking,
I was freaked.

443
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.090
I saw that movie in Houston,
Texas.
Chris Mcguire and I did a show.

444
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:45.980
We did a show at the old laugh stop.
You ever do the old laptop and river

445
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.450
<v 1>oaks?
Did I do that one dre club?
I think I just,</v>

446
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.210
whatever the classic one was that Hixon all those guys,

447
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.070
it had just moved to the new spot to spot sucked.
The new spa was not good,

448
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.450
but the old spot was amazing and that's where I did my first album.
That was a,

449
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:03.261
I'm going to be dead Sunday.

450
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:08.261
I did in 1999 we did a show and then McGuire and I met these kids that worked

451
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:11.520
across the street at the movie theater and they go,
Hey,
do you guys,

452
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.010
we have the keys to the movie theater.

453
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:17.000
Do you guys want to go watch the Blair witch?
Just us.
And we were like,
Holy Shit,

454
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.630
let's do it.
So we left.
We had a 10 o'clock show.
It's like midnight.

455
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:21.650
We go across the street,

456
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.510
they fucking cook up the popcorn and the whole deal gave us free Sosa lock the

457
00:24:26.511 --> 00:24:29.570
door.
You could even do that today.
It was amazing.

458
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:32.420
I mean today everything's digital,
you know,
the kid spools up the fucking,

459
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.720
the real and everything like that.
And we sat down in the theater,

460
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.560
it was like three of them and two of us,
and we watched the Blair witch and shit,

461
00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:44.270
our pants.
It was awesome.
Oh my God,
Josh screaming.

462
00:24:44.271 --> 00:24:48.290
I still remember that when the kid staring in the corner.
Oh yeah.

463
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:50.210
When they just sorta like went past it again.

464
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.750
All of that shit where it rather than just showing you saw on somebody's head

465
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:58.460
off.
Just the idea when you think of like Tarantino talked about that where in

466
00:24:58.461 --> 00:24:59.570
reservoir dogs,

467
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.740
he had one scene where they showed the guy hacking the year off versus just

468
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:06.110
panning away and hearing the guy screaming.
It's just like,

469
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:08.810
it was way more fucking disturbing that,

470
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:11.540
that ruined that song for me for a long time.

471
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.020
I always hear what song was that Marvin Nash screaming.
Um,
uh,

472
00:25:16.021 --> 00:25:20.120
now here Stephen writes voice,
uh,
Lynn,
I don't know if,

473
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.120
oh yeah man.
And he's in

474
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:29.520
that was that said something to
remember that when he,

475
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.120
he through adding a fun song to a horrific scene,

476
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.630
that was so the powerlessness of just fucking,
I can't,
I can't,

477
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.450
I can't deal with,
that's like Scarface member Scarface.

478
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.510
When they cut the guy up with a chainsaw,
he's tied up in the,
in the bathtub

479
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.020
and they forced Tony Montana to watch.

480
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:54.540
He's getting splattered with blood as a hack his friend up.
Yeah.
No

481
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.580
mother

482
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.040
<v 0>took us to see that.
She didn't know what it was.
Took all of us to see.</v>

483
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.850
And my youngest brother was like nine I think.
And if my,

484
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.230
if my mother said after this chainsaw scene we have to get out of here,

485
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:11.100
I would have been like,
fine.
Cause I'm been watching that going,

486
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.170
oh that goes really?
I asked my mother years later,
she was just like,
well yeah.

487
00:26:15.171 --> 00:26:19.160
I thought at that point,
yes,
that it might've been a little mature,

488
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:24.320
mature for your youngest brother and,
but I was laughing.
I was going,
yeah,

489
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:26.990
but you always took us to cool movie.
She goes and she goes,
yeah,
she goes,

490
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:27.980
that was a good move.
She goes,

491
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:32.030
I'm gonna take care of those stupid things like she was against like the whole,

492
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:32.660
uh,

493
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.100
she took us to for love of Benji and Herbie goes to Monte Carlo and then they,

494
00:26:37.101 --> 00:26:39.800
my parents were just like,
we're not fucking sitting through this shit.

495
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.480
We're going to go to a movie that we're going to enjoy too.

496
00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:45.920
And then I went from that to like stripes and like scarf do.

497
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:49.330
Your parents isn't fuck kid wears it.
Said fuck it.
We're going to go,

498
00:26:49.331 --> 00:26:52.040
but we're going to go out.
We're going to go.
Yeah,
we're going to see something,

499
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:56.280
but let's leave me.
I'm sweating like a pig.
Can you turn the AC on here?
Let's uh,

500
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:01.080
let's get to,
um,
let's get to what I wanted to promote here.
Uh,

501
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.920
you got your standup special triggered coming out.
So first of all,
all right,

502
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.290
when is it,
when is it airing?
I'm not what I'm saying it,
I'm going to say,

503
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.630
where did you shoot it?
This is what,
I'm bad as an interviewer.
I'm bad to us.

504
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.800
I'm trying to think of what I'm supposed to ask you about.
What did you shoot?

505
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.860
San Francisco.
The Fillmore.
Oh you did?
Yeah,
I want to do it at a comedy club.

506
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:23.430
And uh,
there was like a debate between Netflix and me.

507
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.200
Netflix wanted to do it at a huge place.

508
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.860
I wanted to do it at a tiny place cause I did my last one at the comedy works in

509
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:32.250
Denver,
which is only like a couple hundred people.
And I liked that.

510
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.310
I think there's something about when you're sitting in a living room and you're

511
00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:37.050
sitting on the couch,
you're watching a comedy special,

512
00:27:37.051 --> 00:27:40.990
it lends itself better to be in,
in a,
like a club.
When you're filming it,

513
00:27:40.991 --> 00:27:45.240
it feels more intimate.
You know what I see,
like you're on top of the crowd.

514
00:27:45.241 --> 00:27:49.470
It's leads more like what it would be like the environment that it would be.
So,

515
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.780
uh,
we made a compromise.
We did the film or theater,

516
00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:55.800
which is a fucking really cool theater and it's only 450 seats.

517
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.000
It's pretty small.

518
00:27:57.001 --> 00:27:59.550
It's got a high ceiling and it's kind of a big stage and everything like that.

519
00:27:59.551 --> 00:28:01.680
But it's a fairly small place,
but it's cool.

520
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.510
But next one I'm going to do in a small place,

521
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:05.310
I think I think I might do at the store.

522
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:08.460
He was funny is when I went to go do mine at the Tabernacle.

523
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.560
You had already been there and did one.
So I was like,

524
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:11.790
how am I going to make this different?

525
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:16.190
And I did the Fillmore in 2009 let it go.
I did that.

526
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.250
Yeah.
So I think we're,
we're going back and forth.
You do.

527
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.240
And your new one,
uh,
I did it last Friday.
You did it?
Yep.

528
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.100
I did it at the Ryman in Nashville.
Dude.
I just,
I was just there.

529
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.180
I fucking loved that place.
Place is crazy.
He used to do the Grand Ole Opry,

530
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:38.180
Cedric the entertainer,
just a did one there.
So I uh,

531
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.960
watched like the opening to his just to see,
cause I was just like,

532
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:45.720
cause then you got to kind of disguise it so it doesn't look like,
oh my God,

533
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:48.990
he's at the exact same fucking place,
you know,
you know it guys huge.

534
00:28:48.991 --> 00:28:53.040
So I had to make sure I will.
It's like all right,
well we got to try to,
you know,

535
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.230
he came in with like a whole marching band and all of that,

536
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:58.410
which is the exact opposite to my style.
So I was like,
okay cool.

537
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.580
Kat Williams brought a lion.
He brought out a lion on stage.

538
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.720
That's awesome.
I love that guy.
That guy's fucking hilarious man.

539
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.870
He's fucking hilarious.
Funniest guys alive.
And you know,

540
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:13.920
and just having the balls to go on stage with a fucking line is hilarious.

541
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.950
How did you come?
I want to,
I wish I was in that fucking pitch meeting.

542
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.890
Like all right,
here's the thing,
what's the concept?

543
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.580
I'm coming on stage with a lion.
The lion in a cage,
like a stuffed,
banal,

544
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.100
real one.
He's,
he got so sweaty during this special,

545
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:32.640
he had to stop and change clothes.
Is that right?
Yeah.

546
00:29:32.641 --> 00:29:36.980
He literally stopped cause I'll be right back and went back stage changes.

547
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.670
Fucking cool.
He was drenched.

548
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.140
I mean just completely soaked with sweat is if they pull,

549
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.520
<v 1>when they put that HD makeup on and then there's all those lights on you.
Yeah.</v>

550
00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.650
And then then you're going hard cause it's just special and you really want to

551
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:51.940
make sure you're going to get a good one.

552
00:29:51.941 --> 00:29:55.080
And then if the fucking AC is a little messed up,
if the,

553
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.880
if the crowd's all fucking packed in,
in the wrong venue,
yeah,

554
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:01.240
you can get yourself into a situation.
I don't wear makeup on those things.

555
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.000
I wouldn't wear it for comedy central and a word for the UFC.

556
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:05.800
I don't wear for anything.
I just like,

557
00:30:05.801 --> 00:30:07.110
I don't know if this is what I looked like,
you know,

558
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:10.710
I think it came first of all from fear factor.
Uh,

559
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.530
when I first started doing fear factor,
they wanted it,

560
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.280
they would put like a little anti shine on me.
A little of this,

561
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:16.480
a little that and after a while I'm like,
look,

562
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.180
these fucking people are covered in blood.
I mean,

563
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.060
they've got dirt all over their face and I'm sitting there with makeup on.

564
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:25.240
You have to touch me up in between scenes.
You know how ridiculous that is.
Yes.

565
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.320
And then we would go from that to the UFC where people were literally,

566
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:32.410
their faces are getting busted open there.
Get giant fucking,
it's funny,

567
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:36.250
I never noticed like when I watched you on the UFC,
I never noticed like,
oh wow.

568
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.420
Like he can,
he went on TV without makeup.
That's so brave.

569
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.690
That's such a courageous thing.
I you just,
you look like you.

570
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.550
Well that's what I look like,
you know?
I'm just like,
I'm not,
you know,

571
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.950
my Golberg gets it.
They spray it on.
They got a fucking airbrush.
I'm not kidding.

572
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.710
They have an airbrush.
They do it to everybody.
All the ring girls and everything.

573
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:58.420
The airbrush them.
That's what they didn't go that fight.
I do my giant forehead.

574
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:03.310
I got to get some and forehead out.
Dude,
I got you beat through to you
guys.

575
00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.100
You're not in the same way classes when,
when a crazy on stage.

576
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.950
I sweat like crazy.
I mean my,
my last special,

577
00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:12.130
I looked at it when I was doing the editing.
I'm like,
Jesus,
I'm a sweaty fuck.

578
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.280
Like it just looks ridiculous.
It looks like I'm like,
I'm on drugs,

579
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.490
but you're up there working and you're not like just standing there.

580
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:23.440
So this one I didn't have any,
uh,
this last one I made sure the AC was cranked.

581
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:28.780
Like with each special I learned something.
Yeah.
Uh,
so I was like,

582
00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:29.740
make sure the eight,
you know,

583
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:32.950
the AC cranked don't fucking cake the makeup on or whatever,

584
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:34.720
just so it was just a little bit of that.
That's,
that's,

585
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:39.520
that's all of those stupid little fucking things,
you know,

586
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:43.850
don't stick my parents in the front row.
Please thank them.
It's just beyond,

587
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.030
beyond,
beyond the Pale.
And I don't show any audience anymore.

588
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.230
I decided no more audience.
She never did.
Yeah.
That's their way to go.

589
00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:56.620
No audience shots and everything.
Kinda mostly from the waist up.

590
00:31:56.621 --> 00:31:59.740
Unless you need to see my legs for like a particular thing I'm doing.

591
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.870
I want to know all your secrets because,
because now I feel like,

592
00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.920
um,
because there's so many specials coming out,

593
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.330
so many fucking special's coming out that uh,
you know,

594
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.710
that then it becomes like you,
you have to have like whatever you'll look is,

595
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.091
you know what I mean?
I mean,

596
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:21.700
the thing about it is you have such a great act that's going to stand on
anyways,

597
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:24.850
but if you can add like your own sort of style,
the way you shoot them,

598
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.870
that becomes part of your thing.
That's another way to try to get it out.

599
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.950
Cause you know,
you're going to Netflix with the special dude.
You just,

600
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.970
you're fucking scrolling,
scrolling,
scrolling,
scrolling.
I guess.

601
00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:37.690
So I just wanted it to be like,
you're watching it like no cutaways.

602
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.090
I don't want to cut into the left into the right cut and for no reason.
Like,

603
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.790
like I,
there was a director that I worked with wants,
who was like,
you know,

604
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:45.530
we'd have to cut to the audience,
you know,

605
00:32:45.531 --> 00:32:46.960
that's how we're going to do our edits.
I go,

606
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.150
let's just try and deal with no edits.
We can,
we can't.
I go,
of course we can.

607
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:53.750
If I do a good show,
we could do it with no edits.
He was like,
no,
look,
trust me,

608
00:32:53.751 --> 00:32:56.600
we're going to do this.
I'm like,
no,
this is my fucking special.

609
00:32:56.601 --> 00:32:58.080
Like I don't even know you.
Yeah.
Like you're,

610
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:02.420
you're coming in here and you wanted to do all this stupid shit and film the

611
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:04.910
crowd and you know that people want to know the people are laughing.
I'm like,

612
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:07.880
they're going to hear them laugh and I can take it.
In my opinion,

613
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:10.910
it takes you out of it because one cell phone.
Yeah,
perfect.

614
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:14.900
He sits down for like an hour and 40 minutes chilling.
They never,

615
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.090
they never go to the crowd.

616
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:21.290
The background just slowly changes different colors and guy absolutely murdered.

617
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.370
You and I were supposed to go see bill Cosby and Vegas.
We had made like a,

618
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.810
we were talking about doing it,

619
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:30.380
but we both flaked and we never wound up doing it and that's one of my main

620
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:33.830
regrets to this day.
I would have liked to see him before the stink hit him.

621
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.300
I did.
I saw it right before I met him and then three months later I saw him.

622
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.290
Do you remember when he was doing shows still like all those women were coming

623
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:46.190
out and he was still doing shows,
like he was still doing shows.
He was like,

624
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:47.510
fuck it,
I'm still doing them.

625
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.060
And he went out and he still did those shows for a little while.

626
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.120
I think he thought he was powerful enough to just sort of ignore it.

627
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.410
And then it wasn't going to La.
It wasn't going to come around.
But dude,

628
00:33:57.411 --> 00:34:00.110
I gotta tell you if you gave me a thousand guests,
not a thousand,

629
00:34:00.111 --> 00:34:03.710
but if you gave me 200 guests as his name would not be on that out of all the

630
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:06.470
fun of all the fucking people.
Like if you,
if you said,
okay,

631
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:09.200
this is a comic out there doing this shit,
really,

632
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.810
you got your top 20 where you'd be like,
Oh yeah.
You know,

633
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.400
why didn't I never heard the rumors?

634
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:17.330
I did hear the rumors and also there was a time I might not in the club house.

635
00:34:17.331 --> 00:34:20.500
How am,
how am I a comedian this long and I'm not fucking here in the rumors.

636
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.750
I heard it from Hollywood people.
I didn't hear it from comics.

637
00:34:23.751 --> 00:34:25.280
I heard it from people in the business.

638
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:29.390
I heard it from like actors and from people that like work on TV shows,
sets.

639
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:32.660
I heard it during the news radio days.
I had heard it.
Yeah,

640
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.310
he was doing it at the show.

641
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.200
He was doing it to people that were on the ship or two,

642
00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.330
two people allegedly who the fuck knows,
but there's something.

643
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.350
It was something unbelievable.
Unbelievably creepy.

644
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.440
But after the accusations came out,
when he was still doing shows,

645
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.790
he would go on stage with one.
I look into the left one.
I look at strict.

646
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.530
He developed a dead I somewhere along the line.
Right.

647
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.790
So He'd go on stage with that.
Weird,
I have some slack.
He's like nine.

648
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.090
I Know David for the grace of God,
but he's dying,
right?
I mean that's my point.

649
00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:04.040
It's like things are falling off the wheels,
right.

650
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.700
The wheels are falling off the ride and he's got the shirt on this sweater on

651
00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:10.550
that says hello friend and he's,

652
00:35:10.551 --> 00:35:15.350
he's on stage and he walks out there and everybody's clapping and cheering and

653
00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:19.670
some guys,
Yana,
you're a rapist,
you are a rapist.

654
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.240
And then they grabbed the guy and shuffle them out and then people going,

655
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:27.050
we love you bill.
And he just doesn't even acknowledge that.
Just ignore them.

656
00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:31.310
Just ignore them.
Yeah.
It was something crazy about that.
It was like the last,

657
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.900
the last sparks before they throw the water on the fire.

658
00:35:34.901 --> 00:35:36.940
It's like there was just a little hope like,
yes,

659
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.910
some embers blast spark before they to the gas.
You mean?
I mean his career,

660
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.000
his life,
they threw water on him.
Like,
I mean he's just,
it's over.

661
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.190
Like no one's going to go see him life now.
Right.
I mean it's kind of over.

662
00:35:48.191 --> 00:35:51.720
It doesn't water put out the sparks.
Yes.
That's what I mean.

663
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:54.940
The through the water on them,
they said it.
Wouldn't that mean that he saved it?

664
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.831
He had,
no,

665
00:35:55.831 --> 00:36:00.750
I mean like you had a moment of like there was still some sparks and oh okay,

666
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:02.580
I kicked the accusations came out,

667
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:05.220
but he was still doing these shows and people still came out and they're like,

668
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:10.020
we love you bill.
He's got these shirts,
analogies to me,
I'm not the brightest.

669
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.300
It wasn't a good analogy.
You're right.
Analogies probably better.
You know the,

670
00:36:14.301 --> 00:36:18.060
the,
the blowing the,
the flames on the fire.
It's like we almost had it out.

671
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.260
Like it was almost,
you know,
my last flight sort of caught on fire wise.

672
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.780
Helicopter flight.
No,
no,
no.
We were playing

673
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.040
<v 0>air jet flying back from my special Nashville,</v>

674
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:33.300
the La and we got up to cruising altitude.
It smelled like burnt popcorn.

675
00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:36.990
So I was like,
did the stewardesses is like,
I'll fast forward through this.

676
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:38.430
Cause I told her,
he told him,
I think I was like,

677
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:40.500
did they burn the fucking meal or something?

678
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.820
And then it sort of went away.

679
00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:48.480
Then it kind of came back and I felt this with everybody had the shades pulled

680
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.800
down and I felt like we were starting to descend.
And then it felt really like,

681
00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:56.100
I felt like the wing shaken and shit and I was like,
oh wow man,

682
00:36:56.101 --> 00:36:57.210
like there must be some turbulence.

683
00:36:57.211 --> 00:36:59.730
I thought he was just descending to go underneath it and then go back up again.

684
00:36:59.731 --> 00:37:01.890
You know,
they didn't get a little bit of a smoother air here.

685
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.750
Sorry about the mummy ride.
If I was going to be doing that,

686
00:37:03.751 --> 00:37:05.070
she had never said a fucking word.

687
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.010
And then all of a sudden like Mike drink that was in the lead,

688
00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.870
little middle armrests started sliding forward like it was going to fall into

689
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:15.720
the floor.
And I'm like,
Oh fuck.
And then the stewardess came up.
She goes,
yeah,

690
00:37:15.721 --> 00:37:18.080
we're going to be landing here shortly.
So I have to take those drinks.
Right.

691
00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.880
And then the woman next to me so landed premature.
Oh yeah.

692
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:23.220
We only 50 minutes into the flight from Nashville to La.

693
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.560
My favorite thing was the woman next to me take the headphones off.
She's like,

694
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.690
are we here ready that way?
Just fucking tell we were on the Concorde.

695
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:35.250
I was like,
no,
I was on fire.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what it was.

696
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:39.360
I always thinking like,
oh fuck,
this is going to be something in somebody's bag.

697
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.090
Like the luggage is shit or some shit.
Like that value jet,

698
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:43.680
something caught on fire underneath there.

699
00:37:43.681 --> 00:37:45.810
And like my whole thing was when we were going down,

700
00:37:45.811 --> 00:37:49.290
I wasn't nervous because he had full control of the plane,

701
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.170
maneuvering it and all that.
And I just knew like,
yeah,
if you,

702
00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:56.130
if you smell smoke that is a,
uh,
the procedure is land immediately.

703
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.700
So that's what he's doing and we're at 30,000 feet up so he's going to land

704
00:37:59.701 --> 00:38:03.510
quickly.
That's the shaking.
That's fine.
I feel as making turns and banks,

705
00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:05.760
everything's working.
But my whole thing is,
you know,

706
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:07.350
I don't know anything about planes,
but I'm just like,

707
00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:10.080
if it burns through the wrong wire,
if the hydraulics,

708
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:12.940
like what the fuck's going to happen?
So,
um,
yeah.

709
00:38:12.941 --> 00:38:16.080
And we came into a landing and little rock and we came in like over this river

710
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:19.320
and I couldn't see the runway.
Oh cause you can't see straight.

711
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:20.160
So I'm just going at to sign.

712
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:22.410
I just see this fucking river going to be following it.

713
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.341
That's something that like,

714
00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:25.980
is he going to sell this thing and fucking sentence into the water?

715
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.640
And I was already thinking,
and you know what's going to happen?

716
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:32.010
The front part of the plane's going to get fucked up so that door's not gonna

717
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:35.920
open some fucking fight.
Pass these FirstClass people into coach.

718
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.500
You know what I mean?
We're real people work.
So they're going to be out.

719
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.110
They're going to out muscle me as they get through this.

720
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.050
I'm going to be fucked if we use the first class though,

721
00:38:43.051 --> 00:38:45.040
I can take out the check next to me.
I'm fine.

722
00:38:45.041 --> 00:38:48.250
People are going to be unconscious anyway,
just from the stress and the impact.

723
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:53.290
Do you know it's uh,
was hilarious.
Was the,
the woman across the alphabet,

724
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:56.890
it was totally freaking out because unfortunately her dad I guess had died in a

725
00:38:56.891 --> 00:38:59.800
plane crash.
So she was totally like,

726
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.520
like totally fucking hyperventilating to the point it was making me angry.

727
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.040
Like how fucking freaked out she was.
Well,
what kills me is she's tall.

728
00:39:07.041 --> 00:39:09.520
She's totally freaking out about that,
but I swear to God,
Dude,

729
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:12.670
like 10 minutes earlier,
barefoot walked in,

730
00:39:12.671 --> 00:39:17.080
use the bathroom and came back out.
That doesn't scare her.

731
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.740
That doesn't scare her.
But a fucking a couple of lights on in the cockpit,

732
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.770
you know,
and the smell of burnt popcorn.
Now she's freaking out barefoot.

733
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.380
What the Fuck I put in the bathroom is,
is a new thing.

734
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.660
I've been flying for 20 years.
I've never seen it.

735
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.410
It started it with socks and now it's fun socks or even fucking worse.
He's like,

736
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:33.720
you obsess store pissed.

737
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.270
But whatever happened to women where they decided to wear shoes that hurt like w

738
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:42.640
if they always have.
But what the fuck is that about?
That is we chose the of the,

739
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.260
of their lack of power,
uh,
they couldn't get a good job.
You know what I mean?

740
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:49.840
Believe me,
if it was switched the other way,
if you made a dollar less an hour,
I,

741
00:39:49.841 --> 00:39:52.120
you could imagine the shoe should be wearing right now.
Joe,

742
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.310
do you know that that's not true?

743
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:57.970
<v 1>Do you know that at that whole thing about the the,
the gender disparity,</v>

744
00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.630
the wage gap is not true.
Do you know what the variable that actually is?

745
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.360
It's choices in jobs.
It's not job for job.

746
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:06.550
Like if you were an engineer and you work next to a woman,

747
00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:08.980
she wouldn't be making 70 cents to your dollar.
It's bullshit.

748
00:40:08.981 --> 00:40:12.280
It's a lie and it's one of those propaganda things that they like to tout out.

749
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.220
And you heard fucking Obama talk about it.

750
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.230
Sarah Silverman talked about and when she was trying to get Hillary Clinton

751
00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:19.750
elected,
it's a,
it's a weird thing that people keep.

752
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.610
<v 0>I thought she was with Bernie Sanders.</v>

753
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.580
I thought Sarah Sylvan was with Hillary Clinton.

754
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.260
I thought it was initially Bernie Sanders.

755
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:29.680
Maybe she was then everybody jumped ship and went fucking Hillary include Bernie

756
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:32.110
who then fucking endorsed Hillary and so it's like that.
Why would you do?

757
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:33.440
That'd be because your credibility.
You're

758
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.010
<v 1>right.
It might be Bernie.
She was endorsing,</v>

759
00:40:35.011 --> 00:40:38.550
but it's that thing that they say that's just not true.
What it is.
It's two.

760
00:40:38.551 --> 00:40:41.760
It's two factors.
One,
there's the law.
This,
the less hours.

761
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.690
Women tend to work less hours.
They also tend to take risks because they're lazy.

762
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:50.640
Well,
it just have the kids choking maternity leave,
one for the left.

763
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.940
There's maternity leaves is a bunch of other factors.
There are less crazy,

764
00:40:53.941 --> 00:40:56.880
less ambitious.
They don't have as much testosterone.
Obviously.
They're not just,

765
00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:01.320
it's fucking crazy man or be willing to work themselves into the grave and when

766
00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:03.930
they're working side by side doing the same job,

767
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:05.490
there's almost no disparity at all.

768
00:41:05.491 --> 00:41:07.920
There's a few jobs where men get paid more than women,

769
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.040
but it's not much and it's certainly not 70 cents to the dollar,

770
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.040
and this is one thing that gets touted out over and over again by people,

771
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.930
but it's just not true.
I have no idea.
I'll look.

772
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:20.010
I had a friend of mine who I got in an argument about it when he's talking about

773
00:41:20.011 --> 00:41:20.810
divorce,

774
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:24.810
where we were talking about a buddy of ours that got fucked in a divorce and he

775
00:41:24.811 --> 00:41:27.670
goes,
hey,
maybe it's to make up for the fact that women only make 70 cents now.

776
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.501
I go,
okay.

777
00:41:28.501 --> 00:41:31.890
The fact that you say that drives me fucking crazy because you think it's a good

778
00:41:31.891 --> 00:41:34.550
point.
Don't yet.
And he goes,
yeah,
I do you ever research that?
And he goes,
no,

779
00:41:34.551 --> 00:41:37.580
but it's a fact.
I go,
it's not a fact.
I go,
it's not a fact.

780
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:41.510
They make 70 cents compared to guys.
Yes,
the guy said this.

781
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.330
He's a guy who likes to argue.
He's a friend of mine,
likes to argue.

782
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:48.070
He's one of those guys.
You just got it.
Yeah,
you got to walk away from it.

783
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.690
Now he's a good guy.
He's a good guy,
but he's got a fucking problem.

784
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.970
He doesn't like when he doesn't know something and when he doesn't know

785
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:56.840
something he go,
he doesn't go,
Holy Shit.
Really?
He goes,
that's not true.
And I go,

786
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:00.650
what the fuck?
It's true.
It's fucking true.
Like go Google it.

787
00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.680
Like we got an a big fucking crazy web series.

788
00:42:03.681 --> 00:42:06.020
I want to watch you guys drive from here to San Francisco.

789
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:08.380
Just watching you losing your shit.
It's fucking true.

790
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.490
Couple of times we've gotten in these arguments,

791
00:42:10.491 --> 00:42:13.550
we've gotten like three of them and he's like,
I,
when I'm not,

792
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:16.610
when I don't know something,
I'll say,
I don't know.

793
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:20.030
Or if someone says something and I didn't know that,
I'll go,
holy shit.

794
00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:23.640
Is that true?
He's the opposite.
He's like,
that's not true.
So,
Oh,

795
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.030
if I don't know something,
I'll do a bit on it twice.
Twice.

796
00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:29.030
This fucking guy's done this beside that.
Like I know what I'm talking about,

797
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:33.520
but I might get a bit on the wage gap on my new,
my new special.
Yeah.

798
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.110
Well there you go.
Won't fit on.
My whole thing was like,

799
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:39.830
how the fuck did they find out what everybody makes you just call up the IRS.

800
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:43.280
Can we get that to on everybody?
They're going to give you that information.

801
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:48.020
Well,
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I have no idea,
but all I know is this what?

802
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:51.800
It's harder for them straight across the board.
That is the three women,

803
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:55.580
just everything is harder and all of our lives are easier.

804
00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.020
That's the overall fucking message.
You see you're being sarcastic.
I am.

805
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.450
I have one of my favorite jokes of all time.

806
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.570
What about motherhood being the hardest job in the world?
He goes,

807
00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:09.040
how's the hardest job in the world when you were a fucking pajamas all day?
Yeah.

808
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.680
No job you can do when you pajamas.
I love that bit.
My wife hates it.
No,

809
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.740
no,
I'm not saying it's,
it's not fucking no,
but it's fine.
It's fine.

810
00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:22.190
Obviously difficult,
but it's a funny post still go work on an oil rig.

811
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:23.240
That fucking blows up.

812
00:43:23.241 --> 00:43:27.710
Exactly and as you jump into the fucking like on fire water going underneath

813
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:31.160
that and then he's just sitting there with second degree burns and salt fucking

814
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:34.720
water hoping that coast guard gets there before the Sharkey t alive.

815
00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.630
I talked to me about your,
talk to me about the terrible twos.

816
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:45.200
I have a friend of mine who works at a oil rig in Canada in northern Alberta

817
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:49.520
work it's 50 below zero and I go,
well why do you do it?
Cause they work outside.

818
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.480
I go,
how'd he do it?
He goes,

819
00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:55.100
well you keep the truck running and you work for about seven to 10 minutes at a

820
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:58.220
time and then you have to go inside the truck for about a half an hour.
I go,

821
00:43:58.221 --> 00:43:59.780
really?
He goes,
yeah.
He goes,

822
00:43:59.781 --> 00:44:02.510
you can't take it anymore cause you any exposed skin you have,

823
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.170
you try to cover your face up as much as possible.
You put a ski mask on,

824
00:44:06.171 --> 00:44:10.490
but just your eyes just all around your eyes is all fucked up like everything's

825
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:15.140
fucked up.
It's like it's just too cold.
You just can't do it.
50 below zero.

826
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.780
They just work for short stretches of time.

827
00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:20.180
Then they'd go in the car and then the other guy will go out while he's in there

828
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.780
and then he'll go out for like 10 minutes and then they take a break for another

829
00:44:23.781 --> 00:44:26.270
10 15 minutes.
Then the first guy,
we'll go back out again.

830
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:30.140
All of those shows make me so thankful that I'm a comedian.

831
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.160
Those fucking fishing shows

832
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.240
<v 0>the fucking worst job.</v>

833
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:37.590
You had this as far as physically like I will kill myself,

834
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:42.150
perform 30 if I fucking do this.
Out of high school,
I worked on a,
uh,
uh,

835
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.410
there was a knights of Columbus Hall that was having a wheelchair ramp built and

836
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:51.411
I had a carry cement bags and pressure treated lumber every day and I only

837
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:55.620
lasted a little over two weeks.
I think I lasted eight days.

838
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:57.840
I was a gopher on a construction site.
We will,

839
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:03.270
we will roofing in June or July.
And I just remember having to bring up those,

840
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:06.750
first of I brought the Ra,
I bought the wrong color,
fucking shingles.

841
00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:10.770
They wanted the fucking ebony one and this was off Alabama.
What the fuck it was.

842
00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:14.130
So I had to go all the way back,
unload the fucking things.

843
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:17.880
I loaded on load some more back,
brought the fucking things back.
I just remember,

844
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:21.390
dude,
it was just like,
I never ate so much in my life.

845
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.690
Like I'd eat like three sandwiches and like a half hour later I'd be like

846
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:29.460
starving and weight was just falling off of me.
I was just like,
dude,

847
00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:31.470
what the fuck?
This is insane.
And,

848
00:45:31.471 --> 00:45:34.650
but the thing was if I hung in there for like a month,

849
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:39.740
I would have gotten my sea legs.
But I,
I just was like,
no.
But I,

850
00:45:39.741 --> 00:45:42.060
I didn't have it.
I knew it.
I always knew.

851
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.970
I always knew like when I play drums and everything like that as much,

852
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:46.290
every time I thought I was getting good,

853
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:50.010
I go into guitar center and some eight year old kid would get on a kid and I'd

854
00:45:50.011 --> 00:45:53.340
be like,
holy fuck.
Like I W I was like,
dude,
I would pay you to give me lessons.

855
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:57.180
And it's just like,
then when you switched,
when whatever you're trying to do,

856
00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:00.840
when you see like a kid come in and he fucking blow,
I mean blows you away.

857
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.500
It's just like,
it's just like,
oh,
I,
I,
this is,
this is a hobby bill.

858
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.370
This is a hobby.
Well,
he's not a working,
doing construction.

859
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:12.850
It's definitely not a fucking hobby.
It's just brutal labor.
There's ink is,
it's,

860
00:46:12.851 --> 00:46:16.140
it is a gift as far as like seeing how things go together.
Oh yeah.
Dude,

861
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:17.190
this is an art to everything.

862
00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:21.990
It's a construct Louie showcase of fucking contractors.
Oh No.

863
00:46:21.991 --> 00:46:23.280
I mean as far as building houses,

864
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:26.610
but I mean laboring like carrying bags of cement.
There's no fucking art.

865
00:46:26.611 --> 00:46:29.850
The carrying bags of cement.
But no,
but they would give me shit to do like,

866
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:30.031
you know,

867
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:34.530
make this fucking miter cut 45 and I fucked the same cut up three times in a
row.

868
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:38.340
It was up to frame a door jam and I kept measuring to the inside of the corner,

869
00:46:38.341 --> 00:46:39.420
rather the outside of the corner.

870
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.170
Remember the third time I did it that my boss just looked at me,

871
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.470
grabbed the wood and he looked at me the whole time,

872
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:48.120
walked up to the frame and never,

873
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.150
never took his eyes off me and the frame is behind them and you just stuck it to

874
00:46:51.151 --> 00:46:55.680
the fucking wall and just stared at me.
I was so embarrassed.
So it's just like,

875
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.440
oh God dude.
He's like,
dude,
you're going through,

876
00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:02.430
you went through like fucking $20 what?
The stock to make one one fucking cut.

877
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:05.080
Like what are you doing here?
I was just like,
just,
I didn't even pick on,

878
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.980
I can show.
I didn't even pick up my check.
I drove up to the site,

879
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:12.480
I work Monday through Friday and then Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,

880
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:16.290
I drove up to the site and I just looked at it and my body,
everything just said,

881
00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:20.940
dude,
fuck this.
And I just kept driving.
He never called,

882
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:23.580
why would he call me?
I'm the guy waste in lumber.
He doesn't give a shit.

883
00:47:23.581 --> 00:47:27.950
He got free labor out of me and I didn't give a fuck.
And um,

884
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.220
I forget what I did after that.

885
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.700
<v 1>But that was a rough time for me.
But like,
I always knew like if I,</v>

886
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.360
if I didn't like a job and stuff like that.

887
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:36.980
So it's like the Deniro thing and what was that?

888
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.640
The heat you gotta be willing to walk in any moment.

889
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:43.630
You gotta be willing to fucking walk.
You got to know it's bad.
Yeah.
That was it.

890
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:46.360
That was the probably the toughest physical job that I had.

891
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.070
And it was also a good,

892
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.620
it was a good lesson because it was a lesson that like if you worked for

893
00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:54.400
somebody else and you're just doing labor,
he just doing just mindless labor.

894
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.050
You don't have any time for anything else.

895
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:58.840
You think you got eight hours in a day and there's still another 16 you'll get

896
00:47:58.841 --> 00:48:03.550
shit done.
You're exhausted,
you fucking beat and I would go to the gym.

897
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:07.540
I try to work out and I remember trying to hit the bag and I just had nothing.

898
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.450
There was nothing that I'd never felt so tired in my life and it was only like

899
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:14.440
18 I should have been full of piss and vinegar.
I was just dead.

900
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.850
And I remember like all my ambition wheels would just ramp it up.
I was like,

901
00:48:18.851 --> 00:48:21.610
okay,
this is not my fucking future.

902
00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:23.570
I got to figure out what the fuck I'm doing cause I,

903
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.760
I had these delusions that I was going to become a carpenter.
I was like,
wow,

904
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:31.330
getting the union,
I'll start building houses.
That's a good gig.
Which it is.

905
00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:33.790
You know,
if you're,
that's what I thought I was going to do.
Yeah.
You know what,

906
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.060
it's a good gig if you're the guy telling the people to go build a fucking
house.

907
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.250
But if you're the guy out there pouring the forms,

908
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:43.780
even noticed that that's mostly young guys like that is a fucking young.

909
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.160
Even like landscaping,

910
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.970
like after awhile you got to get a crew and you got to be the guy like sending

911
00:48:48.971 --> 00:48:53.290
the crews out.
Cause there's only so long that you can just even like,

912
00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:57.190
I feel like like laborers and that they have like the same career trajectory as

913
00:48:57.191 --> 00:49:00.760
like a professional athlete.
Somewhere around 35 to 38,

914
00:49:00.761 --> 00:49:03.010
your body is going to be like,
dude,
I can't,
I can't,

915
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.070
I can't fucking do this anymore.
You just break down.
There was a,

916
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:10.810
I had a bulging disc in my neck and I went to a,
an MRI place and uh,

917
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:15.780
there was a lady who went in before me,
this lady and this lady,
uh,

918
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:20.470
I was looking at different people's Mris and this lady had the most fucking

919
00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:24.130
ridiculous cartoon bulge of her disc.

920
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.490
Some poor woman who,
uh,

921
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.660
I think she worked in a laundry mat or something like that,

922
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:33.370
just carrying baskets of clothes and her back was just so fucked up and she was

923
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:35.230
probably like 40 years old or something like that.

924
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:39.010
Came over your hair from Mexico or Guatemala or something.

925
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:43.300
And I remember looking at her back like in like,
this poor lady has no choice.

926
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.610
She has to go to work.
There's no way around this.

927
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.560
And there's no jobs for her other than this,
you know,
like what?
She's,

928
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.580
she can't speak English like she's got to do what the fuck she's got to do.

929
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.580
And she had you went into our chart,
Huh?
He started reading right there.

930
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:57.160
It was just sitting up there on the screen right now.
And I asked the guy,

931
00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.740
whose bag is that?
He goes,
it's her.

932
00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.220
It's like a holy Shit I got is mine looked that?
He goes,
no.
He goes,
that's bad.

933
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.090
He goes out.
It's bad.
It's real bad.
Like she could barely walk.
Look,

934
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:10.630
she had sciatica up and down her leg.
Oh,
I had that.
Yeah.

935
00:50:10.631 --> 00:50:11.464
Well that's what that is.
Like,

936
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.850
what Sciatica is the bulging disc to disc that's pressing against the nerves you

937
00:50:15.851 --> 00:50:20.470
had it would you do about it?
I went to,
I'm a sous that helped.
Oh yeah.

938
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:25.330
And she actually,
she works on a,
she's a magician dude.
She started with like,

939
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.040
uh,
I came real who she

940
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.730
<v 0>started with,
but what,
how it came through me was through my drum teacher.</v>

941
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.830
So it was like MMA people.
Ah,
okay.
And then,
uh,

942
00:50:36.831 --> 00:50:41.240
you know,
the whole sum drummer,
a guitarist or something was into MMA,

943
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:43.470
fucked up something and he say go to Moma Seuss.

944
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.140
And then she got all the musicians with like that,

945
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.340
what are the tendinitis and all that shit in the forearms.
And then,
uh,

946
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:54.470
it came around to me through my drum teacher and uh,
she,
she was like,

947
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:56.960
I made it like my left side was fucked up,
like the left leg.

948
00:50:57.290 --> 00:51:00.020
And she started with my right shoulder.
Cause you're,

949
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:03.330
Rachel is compensating for your left side.
Yeah.
So she was doing the whole,
I,

950
00:51:03.331 --> 00:51:06.170
let's try to get some information,
you know,
see what's going on here.

951
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:10.610
And then she'd do something.
I just go like,
it should be like,
she just be like,

952
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:15.110
she'd be like,
okay,
this some inflammation.
All right.
And then scale of one to 10,

953
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:19.880
the pain and dude like,
um,
she,
what she did for me,

954
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:24.770
like literally she went so fucking deep.
It was like these memories come out.

955
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:25.551
I'm in.

956
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:29.100
My brother used to just give me charley horses and shit for no fucking reason.

957
00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:33.140
I remembered it.
Yeah.
Like I think it was a store,
like the pain of it,

958
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.550
it just pops up.
I just,

959
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.730
I wouldn't be like literally thinking and you just have the thought that hey,

960
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.650
my brother used to always kicked me in the fucking leg there.

961
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.000
And there was another one.

962
00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.870
I remember I was playing pickup hockey and I had no stuff.

963
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:46.750
All I had was the fucking,
uh,
the,

964
00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:50.450
the helmet and the gloves and the skate had like sweatpants and like a fucking

965
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:53.810
tee shirt or whatever.
And I'm out there like an asshole and I've,
you know,

966
00:51:53.811 --> 00:51:55.730
going down the ice and all of a sudden the other team gets it.

967
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.890
So I pop over to fucking start skating backwards.

968
00:51:57.891 --> 00:52:02.891
I caught an edge and just went up in the air and just landed on my left ass

969
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:07.250
cheek and fucking that whole side dude,
I landed so fucking hard.

970
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.400
Like I couldn't breathe and my eyes were watering.

971
00:52:10.401 --> 00:52:13.130
It's like literally been when you're skating it's like being thrown out of a

972
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:17.540
moving car.
Right.
So I got up and everyone was laughing.
I fucked up my elbow,

973
00:52:17.541 --> 00:52:19.250
you know,
it's hockey,
see just fine.
You know,

974
00:52:19.251 --> 00:52:22.250
I get to the bench and I was fine and,
and a couple of shifts later,

975
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:25.940
it kind of worked itself out and I had bruised my leg so bad.

976
00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:30.050
It was like three days later I was on the road and I was showering or something.

977
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:31.520
I just saw on the side of my leg,

978
00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:35.240
it looked like I had sat in Greece or something and I then I looked all the way

979
00:52:35.241 --> 00:52:36.140
to the back of my leg.

980
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:39.680
It looked like someone took a pipe and just had fucking whacked me.

981
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:41.520
As hard as you could have crossed the back of my leg,
it,

982
00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:45.950
let's get this straight fucking line.
And I think my sciatic nerve thing was,

983
00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:49.010
which is a combination of all of that shit.

984
00:52:49.011 --> 00:52:51.530
And then there was that last thing that did it.

985
00:52:51.531 --> 00:52:54.760
So she fucking worked all the way out of that.

986
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.680
She gave me all these stretches and then I found like a good chiropractor and

987
00:52:57.681 --> 00:53:01.620
all that.
And um,
I had been so good now.
Yeah,
I'll do it.
I couldn't,

988
00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:07.080
I couldn't even sit down because of,
uh,
my,
my,
my feet were stuck,

989
00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:10.420
would start to tingle and stuff with numbness is way worse than pit.

990
00:53:10.421 --> 00:53:14.000
That's beyond pain is what I heard.
Still the numbness thing is worse.

991
00:53:14.001 --> 00:53:15.260
So she goes,
all right,

992
00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:19.100
we're going to work you from numbness down to pain and then pain,

993
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:23.000
hopefully down to that.
And not just,
I just started going every fucking week,

994
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.830
but uh,
I've got a machine I have to show you.

995
00:53:24.831 --> 00:53:28.530
It's a reverse hyper and it's a machine that decompresses your back while

996
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:31.020
strengthening it.
It's your,
your lift weights with it.

997
00:53:31.021 --> 00:53:33.510
You lift your legs up and then it strengthens your back.

998
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:36.390
And then as you lift your legs,
galleys Shit.
Well,

999
00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:38.400
I work for the ultimate fighting championship.
I mean,

1000
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:41.820
I've been an athlete my whole life shit for every time I get this fucking

1001
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:45.840
chamber,
I pay attention to stuff.
I mean,
that's what I do.
I,
I mean,

1002
00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:47.280
I've been tension to the wrong shit.

1003
00:53:47.281 --> 00:53:49.200
I've been doing martial arts since I was a little kid.

1004
00:53:49.201 --> 00:53:51.750
I mean it maintaining your body's a big part of that.

1005
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:55.140
It's one of the most difficult parts of martial arts is not getting injured all

1006
00:53:55.141 --> 00:53:58.040
the time.
Your con,
because martial arts are all about hurting people,
right?

1007
00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:00.180
So it's practicing,
hurting each other.

1008
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.050
So like you have to find good partners and then you'll always,

1009
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.850
that guy in class then goes to fucking hot.
There's always that.

1010
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.400
That's Charlie Murphy talking about that guy.
Yeah.
Was a big problem.

1011
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:11.640
Kelly sent me and I only lasted a couple of weeks in the Dojo and my fucking
add,

1012
00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:15.540
maybe I'll learn how to cook now.
You know,
I just,
I left her,
but she,

1013
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.000
I was just like,
is the deal you're going to go down there?
When was this?
Oh,

1014
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.540
back we doing the rich bitch tour.
Really?
Yeah.
You were doing.

1015
00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:28.230
We could have martial arts reading,
whatever style he has.
His fucking black dude.

1016
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.290
I only,
I only lasted like two weeks.
I fucking,

1017
00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:34.870
I actually took Jujitsu with dom fig.
Did you really?

1018
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.700
In the late nineties I lasted like five weeks of doing that actually.

1019
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:41.670
Did I write?
I did.
All right.
But then the guy teaching,

1020
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.800
he couldn't speak English and this lady like dislocated like her fucking rib

1021
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:47.341
cage can,

1022
00:54:47.341 --> 00:54:51.990
something fucked up happened and he didn't know what to do and I just remembered

1023
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:54.540
like,
you know,
it was coming home with bruises and shit.
It was like,

1024
00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:57.240
that was like when pilot season you could actually get on something and I was

1025
00:54:57.241 --> 00:54:58.890
just like,
the fuck am I doing?

1026
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:03.300
Why don't I make enough money where I have security get to actually get on

1027
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:05.830
something funny.
You remember development deals?
Yeah.

1028
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.410
And Shit could actually happen.

1029
00:55:07.411 --> 00:55:10.020
And you go to Montreal and get a deal and then you'd be set.

1030
00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:13.860
I just remember the guy who go skip the hip.
It's like this no good.

1031
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.070
It's like this Ah,
is good.
That was the whole fucking class.

1032
00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:21.800
Portuguese like these?
No,
like this escape,
escape shrimp,
skip the hip,

1033
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.740
whatever the fuck he was saying.
And um,
you know,
I,
I learned some shit.

1034
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:28.110
I still know if I'm on my back,
had to get somebody into an arm bar,

1035
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:32.280
but it's probably,
well it was probably,
I look at martial arts,
it's like comedy.

1036
00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:36.390
So like I think that that worked in the late nineties but now that would be,

1037
00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:39.240
it'd be like a Corny joke now.
And I just think like that movie be like,
Dude,

1038
00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:40.260
you're gonna fucking try that.

1039
00:55:40.261 --> 00:55:41.660
Like an eight year old knows how to get out of that.

1040
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.130
Like you're funny at the office,
you think you're going to go kill it.

1041
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:48.960
The Ryman auditorium.
Yeah.
Right.
That's the difference.

1042
00:55:48.961 --> 00:55:50.970
Yeah.
It's more like a time thing.
We're like,

1043
00:55:50.971 --> 00:55:54.270
that was probably state of the art shit,
whatever.
We stayed in the yard then.

1044
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.420
I mean,
you're talking to it.
Oh my God.
I was like 18 years ago.

1045
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.180
There's no fucking way that move.
Everybody knows that moves.

1046
00:56:00.181 --> 00:56:03.840
It's like playing drums.
Well,
actually all the standard old school moves.

1047
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:06.870
A Brazilian Jiu Jitsu are still good.
They're all still good.
If you're good,

1048
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:07.471
I'm like,

1049
00:56:07.471 --> 00:56:11.430
there's some guys that are really good at what you would call basic is a weird

1050
00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.920
classics.
Yeah,
basics.

1051
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:16.050
A weird word and people get upset when you say they're Jujitsu is very basic,

1052
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.740
but some of the best guys ever have what you call basic Jujitsu.

1053
00:56:19.741 --> 00:56:24.400
It's not that it's basic,
it's just they have only a amount

1054
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.870
<v 1>of moves that they use,</v>

1055
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:30.640
but they have them sharp into a razor's edge and it's not that they not,

1056
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:32.710
they're not capable of doing everything else.
It just,

1057
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:36.430
some guys like there's guys that are known for just having a guillotine choke.

1058
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:39.250
That's all they do and you can just got to avoid that fucking guillotine choke

1059
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:40.330
and they might still get you with it.

1060
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.370
There's some guys that just went by triangle

1061
00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.070
<v 0>all the time,
only by triangle and there's guys who only wind by,
he'll hook.</v>

1062
00:56:46.071 --> 00:56:49.760
There's a bunch of different guys.
Shit.
Who's like the California kid?

1063
00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.270
Uriah Faber.
Oh Dude,
that guy's hilarious.
Did you see him when,

1064
00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.210
when he was on the ultimate fighter?
Sure.
Okay.
That thing that he,

1065
00:56:56.211 --> 00:56:59.900
when he gave that kid shit early on when he was trying to make the show and

1066
00:56:59.901 --> 00:57:02.120
whatever,
he got caught and pick a move,
whatever the fuck it,

1067
00:57:02.121 --> 00:57:04.820
rear naked choke or something like that.
And then when the kid went,

1068
00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:08.870
the kid goes in and he loses rear naked choke.

1069
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:12.170
And as he went out like a Uriah just goes like,
yeah,
he goes,

1070
00:57:12.171 --> 00:57:16.190
that's what he's known for.
Look them up.
And what I loved about that,

1071
00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:20.990
it was like old school parenting,
like no fucking sympathy.
It's just like,
and it,

1072
00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.320
and I thought it was a very empowering thing to do to that person.
Like if he,

1073
00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:26.960
once he got past the defeat,
like you'd be sitting there going like,
yeah,

1074
00:57:26.961 --> 00:57:29.990
what the fuck?
You know,
that this is what the guy did.

1075
00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:35.090
Let him beat you with anything else.
But that,
that's so easy and this is on me.

1076
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:37.670
It's so much easier said than done.
It's,
it's a,

1077
00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:40.520
it's incredibly difficult to stop someone who's really good at something.

1078
00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:43.100
If they're really good at,
Oh,
I don't think I'd have a problem.
Joe.

1079
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.480
I rented the last 20 seat.

1080
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.020
What's the,
uh,
what was we got?
We got to wrap up.
I do it by like an hour here.

1081
00:57:51.021 --> 00:57:56.000
So like,
uh,
gimme all,
all things.
Joe Rogan,
uh,
where we can see you.

1082
00:57:56.001 --> 00:57:58.480
Any UFC things coming up.
We talked earlier,
there's this

1083
00:57:58.620 --> 00:57:59.530
<v 1>giant giant one,</v>

1084
00:57:59.531 --> 00:58:03.250
giant one and Madison Square Garden because the UFC was illegal in New York for

1085
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:06.760
19 years and it was all because of corruption.
This is a funny story.

1086
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:10.720
The Culinary Union,
the guys who used to own the UFC,
they sold the UFC,

1087
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:14.140
but the guys who used to own the UFC also own station casinos,

1088
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:19.150
they own red rocks and they owned a,
a bunch of different casinos.

1089
00:58:19.151 --> 00:58:22.510
Like I think 22 separate casinos,
maybe even more.

1090
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:25.270
And all their casinos were nonunion.

1091
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:29.710
And this is a vote by the casino themselves.
Like they got paid well.

1092
00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:32.680
And I guess they just decided,
look,
we don't,
we don't need to be union.

1093
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:37.890
So the culinary union was trying to muscle the owners of the UFC into going

1094
00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:42.460
union.
And so the way they would do it is,
I mean,

1095
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:43.780
they have a bunch of different things that they do.

1096
00:58:43.781 --> 00:58:47.590
They'll stand out and military union on a strong,
they're huge.
They're huge.

1097
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.420
And they manage knives.

1098
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:55.840
They managed to keep the UFC out of New York.
And then one of the guys,

1099
00:58:55.841 --> 00:58:58.180
it was in their pocket,
got arrested for corruption.

1100
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.750
He was the main guy that was keeping in UFC out into New York.

1101
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.470
He went down last year at a corruption and right after he went down,

1102
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.000
they passed it in New York state because it was passed in every single day.

1103
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:13.320
<v 0>They told the public that it was all that human cockfighting.
Exactly.
Oh,</v>

1104
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.360
<v 1>they had kickboxing,
boxing,
everything else was legal,</v>

1105
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.240
but they wouldn't let the UFC in.

1106
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.490
And so finally it's legal now and now that it's legal,

1107
00:59:22.491 --> 00:59:23.870
and also there's new owners.

1108
00:59:23.871 --> 00:59:26.510
So the Culinary Union doesn't have a beef with these new owners because they

1109
00:59:26.511 --> 00:59:29.060
don't even have any casinos.
And the,

1110
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.140
the new event that they're gonna put in Madison Square Garden has three world

1111
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:36.560
title fights,
uh,
for former world champions.

1112
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:38.870
Three different fighters were fought for the title before.
I mean,

1113
00:59:38.871 --> 00:59:40.790
it's a fucking unbelievably stacked card.

1114
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.190
The greatest card and the history was growers fight.

1115
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:46.850
Conor Mcgregor's fighting Eddie Alvarez.
It's the F two,
two.

1116
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.030
There's three title fights,
but there's two champions in the,

1117
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:51.980
in the final Conners,
the featherweight champion.

1118
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.780
Eddie Alvarez is the lightweight champion.
And if Connor wins,

1119
00:59:54.781 --> 00:59:58.220
it'd be the first guy to hold two titles simultaneously in the UFC.

1120
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:01.940
How do you get in that Conor McGregor shape?
Is it too late for me at 48?
No,
no.

1121
01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:05.150
You can do it tomorrow.
He's just,
I came home on,
I'm going to give you a pill.

1122
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.130
I'm going to give you an that.
I'm going to give you a mindset.

1123
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:11.270
I'm going to teach you the mindset.
You can't just fucking with you.

1124
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:14.050
Thank no.
I thought I had hope.

1125
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:18.950
I had fucking Ho he's getting great shape.
He's like,
dude,
fucking member.

1126
01:00:18.951 --> 01:00:19.790
Tommy Hearns.

1127
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:24.260
Like that level shredded with Tommy was like a six foot tall fucking

1128
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:27.440
middleweight.
If somehow we could make like what,
what does middle way one 40.

1129
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.450
Well he was one 47 when he fought sugar ray.

1130
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:34.120
Leonard was welterweight and Uncle Ronnie.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
He was just like,

1131
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.600
just like,
it was like you drew them.
Like how do you get that fucking shredded,

1132
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.900
that tiny waist and big broad shoulders and they're ridiculous.

1133
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.490
Right hand power that reach.
Yeah.
Well when he knocked out,
uh,
Roberto Duran,

1134
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:49.520
that's one of the sick,
it was a hook.
Right?
Uh,
I think it was a right hand.

1135
01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:52.310
He face planted them.
I think he hit him with a bunch of things,

1136
01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:54.530
but I think he hit him with,
Oh,
you dropped him twice,

1137
01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:58.100
but then he face plants and with a right hand were Duran just fell like a tree

1138
01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.290
like out.
Yes,
exactly.
Like Marquez.
Um,

1139
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:07.010
so I'm Conor McGregor is not in the best shape.
This is what's interesting.

1140
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.300
I mean,
he's obviously in great shape,

1141
01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:11.610
but he's got a problem with his endurance and it's one of the things that makes

1142
01:01:11.611 --> 01:01:13.430
this fight interesting.
Like he got tired.

1143
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.270
I heard you saying because he has explosive movements,

1144
01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:20.540
he uses up a lot of energy.
He's so fucking fast.

1145
01:01:20.541 --> 01:01:24.500
He's so fast and so explosive that when you have that style of fighting,

1146
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:26.900
it's like sprinting.
Whereas Nate Diaz,

1147
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:31.220
the guy who fought was more of like a marathon runner.
Like Nate.
I love Nate.

1148
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.850
Nate's awesome.
And so as his brother Nick,
but their style is more like,

1149
01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:38.360
they don't go 100% they don't use 100% of their energy with every punch.

1150
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.990
They're more like sixties maybe 70% and they're always,

1151
01:01:41.991 --> 01:01:45.050
they're always fresh and they do a lot of marathon running.

1152
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:49.190
They do a lot of triathlons and they were always doing endurance work.
So the,

1153
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:53.270
their endurance is a big part of their ability to recover and push a pace that

1154
01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:54.560
most people can survive from.

1155
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:58.920
So Connor's is not that guy condoms because he was fighting like Nate Diaz,

1156
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.400
like towards the end he did a lot of looking at the clock,

1157
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:04.190
did a lot of running away to kind of reset.
You ran,

1158
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.190
literally ran away from home and reset and you know,

1159
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:11.840
it's smart to me once when I first did standup and Steve Sweetie was late and I

1160
01:02:11.841 --> 01:02:14.470
was on a material and I just kept looking at the back door,
I was like,

1161
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.070
is he coming?
Is he can come in.
I got nothing left.
I remember those

1162
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.600
Brockton,
Brockton,
Nick's comedy stop number.
Then you stood up on that.

1163
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:28.700
Like it was like one of those awful stages where it was a really small stage,

1164
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:29.251
like a giant you,

1165
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:32.310
it's like you standing on top of her fucking refrigerator for whatever reason

1166
01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.150
and you like looking down on the people.
It was almost like this Andy Kaufman,

1167
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.200
like talk show desk.
But it was the stage.
I don't know if I did Brockton.

1168
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.050
I don't know if I did the cow balloon.
I don't think you were gone by then.

1169
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.080
I might've been gone.
I did.
Uh,
I did the,
the Randolph,

1170
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:50.700
I did Brockton Framingham and then,
uh,

1171
01:02:50.701 --> 01:02:53.760
I think that was it for the Nixon.
And there was of course,
the one downtown.

1172
01:02:53.761 --> 01:02:56.790
I never did Framingham either,
I don't think.
I think that was gone to the moon.

1173
01:02:56.850 --> 01:03:01.020
Of course,
the Lawrence did the column and I didn't giggling Mike Clarke's room.

1174
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:04.920
Did you ever do that with giggles on route one and uh,
so anyway,

1175
01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:06.600
the Conor McGregor thing,
like he's not,

1176
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.180
I would say he's known as one of the best cardio in the world.

1177
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:12.600
You can't say he's not in great shape because he did go five rounds with Nate

1178
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.260
Diaz,
but it's just,
it's not,
he's not the same kind of shape that like,

1179
01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:19.770
like Nick Diaz has swam from Alcatraz five times.

1180
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.490
It gets in the fucking ocean with shark infested northern California.

1181
01:03:23.491 --> 01:03:24.640
Water's sweating.

1182
01:03:24.641 --> 01:03:28.270
And then you have to be in incredible shape to divvy out of your fucking mind to

1183
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:31.920
that too.
But you gotta be in incredible shape.
I got a buddy of mine,

1184
01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:36.480
we just got done running the big foot 200 he ran 204 fucking miles.

1185
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:39.720
205 205 miles in 78 hours.

1186
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:43.800
Three days are running three and a half,
three days in the fucking way.

1187
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.590
Yup.
It's called the big foot.
200 tall documents.

1188
01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:51.720
It's like running 60 to 70 miles a day.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Be Less than that.

1189
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:54.220
50 or something like that.
Yeah,
something like that.
I remember it.
His number.

1190
01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:58.140
Yeah.
Seventies [inaudible] 63 [inaudible] 60 females.
I like what you're saying.

1191
01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:03.000
Three trees and I like it.
18 yeah.
He,
um,

1192
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:05.100
he's run hundreds a couple of times.

1193
01:04:05.101 --> 01:04:09.050
He actually ran a hundred in June to prepare for the 200 in August.

1194
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.140
It's crazy.
So his half marathon is,
is four marathons basically.

1195
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:16.860
Essentially he's a fucking animal.
I mean,
he runs a,
does he,

1196
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:20.820
does he run with those feet sneakers?
No,
we can see the toes now.

1197
01:04:20.821 --> 01:04:24.660
He's sponsored by under Armour.
So he wears the under armor,
a fat tire shoes.

1198
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.620
It's nice cushioning shoe,
but he's,
um,
he's,
he,

1199
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:31.830
he'll run 1450 miles a day every day.
Who came up with that big foot?

1200
01:04:31.831 --> 01:04:36.150
200 savages.
Fucking barbarians.
[inaudible] name's Cameron Hanes.

1201
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:38.640
He's a professional bow hunter.
And,
uh,

1202
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.240
to get in shape for bowhunting is bow hunting is all about like climbing up

1203
01:04:42.241 --> 01:04:44.130
mountains and shit.
Especially when you're hunting elk.

1204
01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.730
I hunt with that guy and it's fucking exhausting and I'm in pretty good shape.

1205
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:49.920
I'm not in great shape,
but I'm pretty good shape.

1206
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.050
I could barely keep up with them.
I mean barely.

1207
01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:54.060
He's barely out of breath and I'm fucking dying.

1208
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.010
I'm just drenched in sweat heaving and trying to fall cause like,

1209
01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:01.080
well you don't want to bring me alive or anybody else.

1210
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:03.750
I mean the way he does it is a very unique,

1211
01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:06.420
when he's like one of the most successful elk hunters in the world and one of

1212
01:05:06.421 --> 01:05:10.830
the reasons is is shape because he can get to places like you've seen an elk and

1213
01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:12.030
the elk goes over the ridge.

1214
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:15.600
The key is you've got to get to that fucking elk quickly because it's moving

1215
01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:18.020
over that Ridge,
right?
So if,
if you look at it,
an l

1216
01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.170
<v 0>can,
it goes over the top of a hill and goes to the other side.</v>

1217
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:23.680
The quicker you can get to that,
the closer it's going to be that hill.

1218
01:05:23.681 --> 01:05:25.870
You've got to get within 60 yards and you don't know how,

1219
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.440
how far it's going to move in the time it takes you to get up there.
Well,

1220
01:05:29.441 --> 01:05:33.070
it takes me maybe 10 minutes to get up there.
It'll take him two minutes.

1221
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.220
So about those extra eight minutes,
that fucking elks way out of range.

1222
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.800
You go down the hill after it,
it's going to see you.

1223
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:42.360
You're never going to get a shot at it.
So he has shot opportunities.

1224
01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:47.370
Do you have any like a re like the one that got away sort of shot like you had

1225
01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.000
it,
you lined it up and whatever.

1226
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:51.940
You exhale at the wrong time and you missed it and then it took off.

1227
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.750
That's elk hunting.
I had five of those two weeks ago.

1228
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.140
This five of those at least.
Maybe six.
Yeah,
we hunted.

1229
01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.860
I shot that one with a rifle because we just couldn't get close enough with a

1230
01:06:02.861 --> 01:06:05.960
bow and just five.
Do you feel your guide going like,
dude,

1231
01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:08.970
are you going to fucking kill one here?
Then what pressure?
Oh,

1232
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:13.330
that's just how it is.
Elk Hunting is hard when you don't,
when you go in earn,

1233
01:06:13.331 --> 01:06:17.080
when are you going to go a wild boar hunting again?
I'm going with you.

1234
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.270
You and I are going to go,
we're going to schedule something soon.

1235
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:22.660
We'll schedule something.
Let's schedule something like maybe after Christmas.

1236
01:06:22.661 --> 01:06:27.100
Yeah,
give me an Uzi and then I'm going to get you a yes.
Ah,

1237
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:27.911
as it comes running.

1238
01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:30.980
Cause those things I saw when I'm standing there watching the uh,

1239
01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:35.180
the chef there from hell's kitchen.
Um,
ah,
God damn.

1240
01:06:35.181 --> 01:06:38.490
And I said his name earlier.
I'm the worst.
Yeah.
Gordon Ramsey.

1241
01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.800
It made it scrambled eggs again this morning.
My wife fucking loves it.

1242
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:44.440
What kind of Cook?
Scrambled eggs.
Oh Dude.
He fucking,
he puts,

1243
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:48.760
this is what he does.
He,
first of all,
he gets,
he gets the pot,
a little pan going,

1244
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:49.594
a little olive oil,

1245
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.290
puts some tomato still on the Vineman name with some mushrooms.

1246
01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:54.640
He just lets that fucking sizzle.

1247
01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:59.170
And then he takes three eggs and like a dollop of fucking butter puts it in

1248
01:06:59.171 --> 01:07:02.110
there.
It doesn't mix.
It already puts it on the flame.

1249
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:05.230
And then he starts mixing this thing around.
He talks about all the chemistry.

1250
01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:06.880
You don't want to mix it before you put it in there.

1251
01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.210
It doesn't put any salt in there.
Cause some reason that does it.
He's like,
oh no,

1252
01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:14.290
he's now off to hate you it and you have to cause the hate.
It's in here.

1253
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:17.350
I've watched it a Zillion fucking times when I'm watching the see heats in the

1254
01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:20.860
pan hates in the pan.
So that's the one thing that I learned.
Um,

1255
01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:25.800
I learned from this guy,
uh,
uh,
Sheff,
uh,
Roy who did,
who uh,

1256
01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.320
Roy Choi who started the whole gourmet food truck thing.

1257
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:32.920
I did like five rows doing shooting this thing and I went over there and I got

1258
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:35.110
to sit.
He taught me this shit about the grilled cheese sandwich.

1259
01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:38.200
And what I learned about these guys is,
dude,
it's all controlling the heat.

1260
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.210
Like my whole shit is just like medium high.

1261
01:07:40.211 --> 01:07:44.320
I'm like medium high for 10 minutes and it's like you're not cooking,

1262
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:47.410
you're just standing there like a fucking bouncer.
Assam Shit.
It's like,

1263
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.000
so he doesn't manipulate it.

1264
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:53.020
So he does all of that and when it gets to a certain level of a coming together,

1265
01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:56.500
then he takes his creme fresh and puts it in there.
What is creme fresh?

1266
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:59.470
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but it's delicious,
right?
And then you get it.

1267
01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:03.550
You bring it back back on the heat and then salt in,
right.
He puts that shit in.

1268
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:06.610
You go and you just keep stirring this fucking thing and it almost looks like

1269
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:08.890
it's water.
You don't think it's done.
You taste it.
You're like,
oh my God,

1270
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:11.200
this is great.
Then you take it off,
right?
No Way.

1271
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:14.080
You chop up a little bit of dill,
you sprinkle it up,
you mix it in there,

1272
01:08:14.081 --> 01:08:16.010
and then the by then the toast pops

1273
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.750
<v 1>up a little olive oil on that.</v>

1274
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.690
He put the fucking scrambled eggs on now with the fucking tomatoes and the

1275
01:08:20.691 --> 01:08:23.930
mushroom,
give it to you wife over,
Woo over.

1276
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:27.840
But then they love it and then they keep telling you to make it and you just

1277
01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.940
can't just do the old scrambled egg with the cheese in it.

1278
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:36.020
I got to get you some eggs.
We have our own chickens.
I have 23 chickens.

1279
01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.700
How long can they lay eggs before you have to fucking retire them?
Well,

1280
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:45.350
they just stop laying eggs after awhile,
but then,
you know,
I just let them live.

1281
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:49.610
They just,
they just live and then they die.
I've had a bunch just die.
How long,

1282
01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:52.970
how long ago?
I've had chickens for now,

1283
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.010
I want to say five years.
Somewhere around there.
Four or five years,

1284
01:08:58.011 --> 01:09:01.970
maybe five years.
And um,
they just fucking die sometimes.

1285
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.270
I've had like a,
but I have some of them that are like five years old,

1286
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:08.570
so there's still five years old.
It's just picture this chicken at his desk,

1287
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.380
you know,
this happened,
those plastic 1950s,
you know,

1288
01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:16.430
back then when nobody knew shit about fucking heart attacks,
it was terrifying.

1289
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:18.290
What is everybody's,
it's just fucking stop.

1290
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.920
And they were all eating bacon and fucking Martinis and all this shit.

1291
01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:24.380
They had no idea.
And that was back when the,
you know,

1292
01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.420
they had no respect for martial arts.
It was all like,
I'll tell you another,

1293
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.020
it's stronger than a good old Sunday punch and they'd be sitting there eating

1294
01:09:30.021 --> 01:09:34.580
fucking stakes and people would just drop it right and left like dropping dead.

1295
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.090
I know you like conspiracy theories.
You look at good conspiracy theory.

1296
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:41.810
It's been like a good one.
The good,
I don't like a real one.
Here's a really once,

1297
01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.360
he doesn't like being lumped in with people who have silly.
I understand that.

1298
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:47.180
Here's a real proven,
it was in the New York Times.

1299
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:52.450
They proved that scientists were paid off by the sugar industry in the 1960s Oh

1300
01:09:52.881 --> 01:09:57.200
yeah,
I have.
Absolutely.
They were paid off to make saturated fat.

1301
01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:59.840
The culprit for all these diseases and fat,

1302
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.750
fat people and heart attacks when it was actually sugar.

1303
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:07.580
I'm 11 tries to tell him the blame away from sugar and pin it on saturated fat.

1304
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:10.790
So Bailey,
scientists,
bacon is actually not bad for you.

1305
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:13.010
Saturated fat is actually not bad for you.

1306
01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:16.340
There's a giant illusion that cholesterol,
everybody thinks to collect.

1307
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:17.480
All your cholesterol is high.

1308
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:22.280
Dietary cholesterol barely moved the needle on blood lipids,

1309
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.010
blood lip.
It's like when they measure your diet,
when you're bent,

1310
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:27.920
measure cholesterol in your blood has to do with a lot of,
sounds great to me,

1311
01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:30.220
but you're also a standup comedian.
You don't mind,

1312
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:33.530
you don't have a white lab coat on.
I'm sitting here like,
okay,
Doctor Rogan,

1313
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.240
you read,
read these things.

1314
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.920
But what gives people high cholesterol is first of all the LDL cholesterol,

1315
01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:42.140
HDL cholesterol,
the good cholesterol and bad cholesterol,

1316
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:44.480
and you can have high of warm because if you have hired the other one,

1317
01:10:44.481 --> 01:10:45.500
it balances each other out.

1318
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.950
I'll send you a podcast if you have the fucking the time to listen to it.

1319
01:10:48.951 --> 01:10:53.660
It's a SAS sit there long enough.
You Ferret.
It's hard.
It's hard.

1320
01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.730
It's hard to sit down and listen to this stuff.
But this guy,

1321
01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:59.540
Chris crusher was on my podcast who explained it all and scientific.

1322
01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.960
One of the great names of all the time,
Chris Kresser,
Chris,

1323
01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:04.530
Chris Kresser crisscross are coming out on a street smart.

1324
01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.330
That question question.
Oh um,
but anyway,

1325
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.080
it's not cholesterol.
The,
it's,
it's a lot of it is hereditary.

1326
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:16.080
Like if you have high pressure or a dietary cholesterol or high cholesterol.

1327
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.040
David Letterman.

1328
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.250
Libby didn't have an ounce of fat on him and he needed open heart surgery.
Yes.

1329
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:24.240
Yeah,
yeah.
A lot of that is hereditary.
Some people just get a shit roll the dice,

1330
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:26.760
just like some kids are born with leukemia.
I mean it's just a,

1331
01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:27.810
it's not something you did.

1332
01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:29.730
It's not like they've been smoking since they were a fetus.

1333
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.320
You know what my big fitness thing is?
I'm big,

1334
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:34.740
big time into body weight exercises,

1335
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:38.820
so I'm trying to get myself strong enough to do a front lever it fucking 48

1336
01:11:38.821 --> 01:11:42.270
years of a front leaf.
Front lever is basically you hang from the chin up bar,

1337
01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.560
you bring your legs straight up and you hang in there like a fucking table and

1338
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:48.360
you've got to put party at weight behind the bar.

1339
01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.450
So there's all of these exercises to explain that.

1340
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:56.070
So just a chat him.
Do you remember planking?
Yes.

1341
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.790
Just imagine if he did it on your back.
You're laying on your back in the air,

1342
01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:02.790
but you're hanging from the chin up bar and your legs are straight out like
that.

1343
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:03.540
Okay.
Yeah.

1344
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.380
So I've been fucking with that full like months trying to build up the strength

1345
01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:10.080
and I got myself to the point because the whole thing is you got to be behind

1346
01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:13.800
the bar and what's great is I got this big head so it kind of fucking,

1347
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.230
you know there's a lot of weight already behind the bar.

1348
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:18.480
Plus I've gotten to a point now where I can actually,

1349
01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:21.960
like I used to be almost hanging upside down and then gradually you can kind of

1350
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:23.730
bring you have your legs in a ball.

1351
01:12:23.731 --> 01:12:25.440
So like the way it is basically underneath it.

1352
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.130
And I've gotten to the point now where I can just start to extend one leg and

1353
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:31.950
then I fall to the ground.
They ain't bad.
I'm going to get there though.

1354
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:32.940
You'll get there.

1355
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.580
I just want to bust that out one time cause I've got a buddy of mine,

1356
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:39.420
he has a bet with me that when I'm 70 I can't do 10 pull ups.

1357
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:42.180
So just to fucking Sunday.
No,

1358
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:46.710
when I turned 70 70 to catch the bedding.
Yeah.
As long as you just keep going,

1359
01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:49.110
you'll you get,
that's the thing.
It's the loans in the 70s.
Yeah.

1360
01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:53.190
But if I don't say he could do 10 pushups,
Chin ups,
if I don't have that bent.

1361
01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.980
I understand that.
How that fuck you.

1362
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:57.660
So it's a great carrot that I'm chasing that I understand.
Yeah.

1363
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.270
You could do that though.
It has nothing to do with age.
You can do that move.

1364
01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:04.110
He's going to do a lot.
It doesn't have to do with butter.
Do Bacon and shit.

1365
01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:06.180
Linkedin lifting,
uh,
you know,

1366
01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:09.960
the best way to do it honestly started doing bodyweight exercises,

1367
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:12.540
do a lot of chin ups and stuff like that,
but do them really slowly.

1368
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.720
That's one of the best ways to really develop serious strength.

1369
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.480
Like a lot of people like to do chin ups and they like to do those like kipping

1370
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:19.770
Chin ups you see in crossfit.

1371
01:13:20.210 --> 01:13:24.480
But what I like to do is what's keeping ego like you kind of like kick up and

1372
01:13:24.481 --> 01:13:27.360
you kick up and you're seeing that's like cheating.
It is like cheating,

1373
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.760
but it's people who arch their back on the bench press.

1374
01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.640
But it's a hard workout if you do a bunch of them.
But it's just,

1375
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.750
there's a lot of criticism.

1376
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:36.270
Why does crossfit have to be done in front of everybody?

1377
01:13:36.271 --> 01:13:37.890
Why can't they just stay in there?
Jim,

1378
01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:40.350
why are they always running up and down the street?
Like look at us.

1379
01:13:40.351 --> 01:13:42.870
We're working out.
Cause it's like,
look at us,
we're working out.

1380
01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:46.770
Should I be more of a charity charge?
Nope.
Nope.
You should rub it in their face.

1381
01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.530
They're like vegans and a lot of ways they want you to know what they're doing.

1382
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.700
You know?
It's like the like that's the,
that's part of the whole thing.

1383
01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:56.250
It's like you become,
there's a whole article about that,

1384
01:13:56.430 --> 01:14:00.770
about it's replacing religion for a lot of people who become tribal and you get

1385
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:04.620
involved in these group a like group activities and you,

1386
01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:06.030
you identify with that group.

1387
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:09.240
Like you become a crossfitter or you become a Vegan or you become a lot.
I mean,

1388
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:12.700
not there's anything wrong with being either one of those who it was like the

1389
01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:17.290
gym is like a garage door is wide open and they're making all this fucking noise

1390
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:20.440
and it's like,
yeah,
I work out too.
You know,
I have the door closed.

1391
01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:24.370
I listen to a little iron maiden lately,
but that's part of the fun of it.

1392
01:14:24.371 --> 01:14:27.410
They want everybody to know they're doing it.
So you walk by go,
wow bill,

1393
01:14:27.411 --> 01:14:30.390
he's in shape and it looks that it looks at him.
He's fucking lifted.

1394
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:31.243
He's doing well.
I've been,

1395
01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.960
I've been out having breakfast and like outside cafe and all of a sudden

1396
01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:37.290
twenties maniacs just run by.

1397
01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:40.870
You get to the corner and then they run back the other way.

1398
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:43.210
You just want to fucking throw your pancakes out of.
Well,

1399
01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:47.440
it's worse if you're walking and they,
they fucking almost run you over like,

1400
01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:51.820
Hey asshole,
this is not a gym.
Okay,
this is a sidewalk.
Like don't,
this is not,

1401
01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.480
is not a place for you to conduct your class.
Maybe it's like a dream thing.

1402
01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:58.660
Like they think the treadmill treadmills take up too much energy.
No,

1403
01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.553
I think you right.

1404
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:02.800
They want people to know what they're doing and you don't have the space to,

1405
01:15:02.801 --> 01:15:06.160
you know,
they don't have a track so they just had to use a sidewalk.
You know?

1406
01:15:06.161 --> 01:15:09.760
I've seen that.
I've seen like groups of people run up and down streets.

1407
01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.940
It's fucking stupid.
I was in Santa Monica,

1408
01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:17.941
it was fucking laughing my ass stupid fucking mountains.

1409
01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.660
But crossfit itself,

1410
01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:22.510
what it does is it gets people to get competitive and when they get competitive,

1411
01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:24.820
the good thing about it is like there's a bunch of people around you.

1412
01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:29.140
You're all pushing each other.
The bad thing about it is a lot of people,
they,

1413
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:33.190
they,
their form falls apart when they start doing high repetitions and they get

1414
01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:35.020
competitive with it and then they start getting injured.

1415
01:15:35.050 --> 01:15:38.590
I know a lot of fucking people that have hurt themselves doing crossfit,

1416
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:42.190
a lot of bells.
People always fuck themselves up right behind in their baby.
Yeah.

1417
01:15:42.191 --> 01:15:43.360
I don't fuck with crap on those.

1418
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.910
These are going to do them slowly and doing with correct form.

1419
01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:49.000
The beautiful thing about kettle bells as you can get a great workout with a

1420
01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:49.840
light Kettlebell,

1421
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:54.070
I could get a great workout with a 35 pound kettle bell is light Kettlebell.

1422
01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.010
Moving it slowly controlling it and every step of the way.

1423
01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.180
And you can do all sorts of exercises to go from one to the other,

1424
01:16:01.181 --> 01:16:05.830
one to the other and he give you get a full body workout that works.
It,

1425
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.480
it's actual functional strength.

1426
01:16:07.481 --> 01:16:10.150
Like it'll apply the effluent of even the reservation with the,

1427
01:16:10.151 --> 01:16:11.170
I'm going all old school,

1428
01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:13.840
I got those atomic holds you like did American Ninja Shit.

1429
01:16:13.841 --> 01:16:16.270
Those little fucking look like little cannon balls.
It does a great,

1430
01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.570
I got those hanging from my ceiling and uh,

1431
01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.450
I'm trying to get the ones that looked like the num chuck handles and I fucking

1432
01:16:22.451 --> 01:16:24.250
went to order the thing and it never came.

1433
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:28.030
And then they sent me an email going like,
Dj,
you still want them?
It's like,
yeah,

1434
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:32.290
I ordered to go to rogue fitness,
rogue fitness.com they have all that crazy.

1435
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:33.560
She got that.
Well that's what I,

1436
01:16:33.561 --> 01:16:37.600
I bought my rack through those guys and I got a speed bag and then I'm going to

1437
01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:41.500
get those Swedish buys and see if I can get myself up to be able to do a fucking

1438
01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:46.240
Cuban flag.
Oh Shit.
Well,
I like the shit lawyer.
I'm working towards something.

1439
01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:49.480
I can't just get on an elliptical every day.
Like I'm doing a half hour.

1440
01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:54.070
And the big thing is what's my new playlist because I will get bored shitless

1441
01:16:54.071 --> 01:16:56.530
with that.
But I feel like with the speed bag,
you know,
I suck at that,

1442
01:16:56.531 --> 01:16:59.980
but I'm getting a little bit better at it.
I'm like learning something.
You know,

1443
01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:02.200
it's funny,
my wife wanted it.
Um,
it wasn't man enough.

1444
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:04.240
I didn't want to have to think but look at it,
look at it.
Yeah.

1445
01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:07.090
It's something cool about doing it.
But do you know,
like Julio,

1446
01:17:07.091 --> 01:17:10.310
Cesar Chavez didn't even know how to do that.
It's kind of useless for boxing

1447
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:12.110
<v 0>and it gives you a little bit of endurance for your shoulders.</v>

1448
01:17:12.111 --> 01:17:15.140
But when the fuck is the last time I watched my dream punched somebody like
this.

1449
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:17.510
Imagine someone stood in front of you and you punched him like this.

1450
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:20.090
I think it was to build up your timing.

1451
01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.060
Then also build up your arms that you could keep your arms up shoulder.
Yeah,

1452
01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.490
right.
But Julio,
Cesar Chavez,
it's hilarious.

1453
01:17:25.491 --> 01:17:26.930
He's one of the greatest boxer of all time.

1454
01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:30.140
And he always used to laugh because he would like try to do it and he couldn't

1455
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:34.150
do it.
When you get knocked everybody out in the fucking key,
everybody.

1456
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:38.660
I mean it was a fucking monster.
Listen Dude,
I'm just trying to get into in the,

1457
01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:40.790
I used to go to Gleason's gym and,
and they,

1458
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:43.640
and they knew I was there and they used to call me billary swank,
you know,

1459
01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:47.270
cause cause a million,
million,
million,
million dollar baby.

1460
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:51.170
It just come out Fillery's Oh no,
we had a great time.

1461
01:17:51.171 --> 01:17:54.920
Charlie Murphy once again gave me,
he gave me,
no,
it gave me the lay of the land.

1462
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:57.920
Jolly goes,
you going down eggs.
They,
okay.
He goes,

1463
01:17:57.921 --> 01:18:00.800
you're going to be down there about three weeks and did a bad Charlie Murphy.

1464
01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:02.540
It goes,
someone's going to come up to you and be like,
Yo,

1465
01:18:02.541 --> 01:18:05.490
how long have you been boxing?
Yo,
nice,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Once you get in the ring,

1466
01:18:05.491 --> 01:18:08.480
you got to do not get in the ring because he wants to go in there and try out

1467
01:18:08.481 --> 01:18:10.480
all the shit that he doesn't have the nerve to try.

1468
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:13.340
Gets a professional fighter and you're going to get fucked up.
Right.
Exactly.

1469
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:17.600
Three weeks,
whatever the fuck he said on the nose,
this fucking,

1470
01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.200
this guy comes up,
black dude from Brooklyn starts coming to a white guy,

1471
01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:24.460
stand up comedian from the suburbs.
Go,
Yo,
your nice man,
you can parks.

1472
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:27.510
I just started laughing.
I got to get the fuck Outta here.
I go,

1473
01:18:27.511 --> 01:18:28.400
I'm not getting the ring with you.

1474
01:18:28.401 --> 01:18:33.230
When he fucking laughed and walked away and I told Charlie thinking he would

1475
01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:36.710
laugh.
You know Charlie's is so fucking real deal.
You just go.
I fucking told you.

1476
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:41.600
It's like I told you,
Charlie Murphy is one of the best guys of all time.

1477
01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:45.200
I did that Maxim tour with him.
I got to know him.
We did 22 dates together.

1478
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.240
He's a fucking great guy.
I really love that dude.
I really do.

1479
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.650
He didn't know one of those guys and my fucking phone went in the toilet.

1480
01:18:51.651 --> 01:18:54.830
I lost his fucking number,
so I'm going to be able to call him.
I think I got it.

1481
01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:58.610
I'll give it to you.
Okay.
Yeah.
I love that.
All right.
We got to wrap this up,
dude.

1482
01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:02.300
I'm sitting like 9 million hours of traffic.
Joe,
you're the fucking best.

1483
01:19:02.301 --> 01:19:04.100
You've been one of the top comics for what?

1484
01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:08.060
2025 I don't know how many fucking years since I was in Boston when I saw you at

1485
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:12.170
the Kowloon and you did your tigers fucking bit,
which sounds like,
oh,

1486
01:19:12.171 --> 01:19:15.450
it's just targets.
Fucking dude.
The dish,
the noise you made of the,

1487
01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.170
the tiger was fucking unbelievable.

1488
01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:21.560
I still remember your bitmaker in front of the chicks out there with the hair

1489
01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:24.650
like a giant.
Oh my God.
It was just,
you're a fucking monster,

1490
01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.860
so I'm so happy for you that you're a,
you got another spa special.

1491
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:32.690
That's out on Netflix.
It's called trigger.
Please watch it.
If you love it,

1492
01:19:32.691 --> 01:19:35.150

So,
uh,
you know,
it will stay on the front.

1493
01:19:35.151 --> 01:19:39.030
Whatever that fucking scrolly thing is.
And uh,
and that's it man.

1494

Fuck you.

1495

No worries.

1496
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:45.350
Still the same way about you man.
You're one of my all time favorite.

1497
01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.530
We're going to have a big hug afterwards.
All right guys,
thanks for listening.

1498
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:53.000
All right,
what's up bill borough here.
All right,
how great was that?
Ah,

1499
01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:56.600
the Great Joe Rogan finally got him on after nine years of doing my fucking

1500
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:59.500
podcast.
Finally got him on.
Um,

1501
01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:02.750
and I didn't do any of the advertising because I knew that it was going to be

1502
01:20:02.751 --> 01:20:04.760
too interesting to sit there and talk to that guy.

1503
01:20:04.761 --> 01:20:08.250
So he has a little bit of advertising.
I what you're thinking.
Oh

1504
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:12.960
<v 2>Shit.
Build a fucking advertising.
That's boring.
Well not the way I do it.</v>

1505
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:17.310
All right,
here we go.
We got a new one here.
See Souls.

1506
01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.880
See so see,

1507
01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:26.000
so there you go.
Fuck you man.
All right.
See,

1508
01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:30.420
so is the place for comedy.
They won't tell you how amazing they are,

1509
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.540
but I will evidently see.
So is amazing.

1510
01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:38.280
It's comedy for comedy nerds by comedy nerds,
CSO,
spelled c.

1511
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:43.281
So s e s o is the new ad free streaming service bringing you hilarious original

1512
01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:48.410

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:50.430
You better not fucking have mine on there and not pay me.

1514
01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:53.370
You [inaudible] hand up picks,

1515
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:57.930

1517
01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:07.170
uh,
every episode of SNL ever.
Really,
Jesus,
this is a big fucking thing.

1518
01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:10.520
Cause those guys,
those guys hoard those specials,
um,

1519
01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.340
those episodes including new episodes the day after they air the tonight show

1520
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:19.090
starring Jimmy Fallon,
Jimmy Fallon from New England.
Oh,

1521
01:21:19.091 --> 01:21:22.740
you did so great.
Um,
and late night with Seth Meyers,

1522
01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:28.220
the day after they air and they even have classics like 30 rock parks and

1523
01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:33.330
recreation and saved by the bell.
Um,
and those are already classics.

1524
01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.040
He's,
he saved by the bell.

1525
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:40.190
Even British comedies like the original office with that dangerous guy,

1526
01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:44.870
Ricky Gervais saw what's he going to do with the MEC.
He's breaking up bear

1527
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:50.250
the entire money python catalog,

1528
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:55.640
the it crowd and Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge discover the next big names in

1529
01:21:57.181 --> 01:22:01.470
comedy and watched the icons before they made it before they made it big like

1530
01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:04.770
Louis C K Chelsea Peretti,
Amy Schumer,

1531
01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.571
Bo Burnham,

1532
01:22:06.571 --> 01:22:10.710
and so much more critically acclaimed originals and exclusive content like

1533
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:16.070
harmonquest created by comedian Dan Harmon and funny as hell a variety show

1534
01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:19.530
featuring such comedians as Jim Jefferies.
Ah,

1535
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:24.210
Jim Jefferies and Hannibal Burress.
Um,
if you're serious about comedy,

1536
01:22:24.211 --> 01:22:27.570
you got to go to seeso streaming.
Anytime Jesus fucking Christ,

CSO is ad free and it's just 399 a month.

1538
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.220

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.490
at ain't point they're going to say what CSO stands for c.

1543
01:22:47.491 --> 01:22:51.120
So I'm seriously ignorance,
Ego,

1544
01:22:51.121 --> 01:22:55.560
thugging Oscars.
I don't fucking know.
It shows what you can get in shows.

1545
01:22:55.561 --> 01:22:58.800
You can't get anywhere else from critically acclaimed original series to all 40

1546
01:22:58.801 --> 01:23:01.080
plus years of SNL CSOS,

1547
01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:05.680

That's great.

1552
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:21.880
Um,
all right.
Hey,
speaking to Joe Rogan,
his,
his company on it,

1553
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:26.590
on it has a new product.
It's called emulsified MCT oil.

1554
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:28.060
What the fuck is that?
Well,

1555
01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:32.530
we're going to tell you MCT oil is one of the fastest sources of clean fuel for

1556
01:23:32.531 --> 01:23:33.880
the body and the brain.

1557
01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.450
It's one of the best ways to power up your performance and kickstart a weight

1558
01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:41.760
management program.
And I should do that.
Rub it right on my stomach.
Uh,

1559
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.100
there are a lot of MCT oil brands out there,
but none.

1560
01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:49.420
There is none like the emulsified MCT oil from Onnit.

1561
01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:50.950
What's emulsification.

1562
01:23:50.951 --> 01:23:53.890
That's like when you got Balsamic vinegarette just sitting there,
okay.

1563
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:57.850
In the fucking vinegarette goes away from the Balsamic or vice versa,
whatever,

1564
01:23:58.030 --> 01:24:02.050
and then you fucking shit up and all of a sudden it's been combined.

1565
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:04.480
It's been a mulcify it you get it.

1566
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.840
It's like a carburetor when you got the air and the fuel mixture and it creates

1567
01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:10.900
that foam that she can't drink,
but it looks like a latte.

1568
01:24:11.290 --> 01:24:15.670
That's some off suffocation.
Emulsification available in three delicious flavors.

1569
01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:20.410
Coconut,
Vanilla and strawberry.
Jesus Christ,
that's me right there.

1570
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:23.350
Coconut head,
vanillas skin,
strawberry,

1571
01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:28.351
pubes emulsified MCT oil mixes like a cream easily in your morning.

1572
01:24:29.051 --> 01:24:33.220
Coffee without the need for a blog.
No mess,
no cleanup.

1573
01:24:33.221 --> 01:24:35.440
You can even mix it into your favorite food.

1574
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:39.670
Liquid Billy red face right here from on it right now.

1575
01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:43.600
If you go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t.com/ [inaudible] you can get on,

1576
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:47.590

1577
01:24:47.591 --> 01:24:51.100
That's on an o and n I t.com/bird.
Again,

1578
01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:55.480
emulsified MCT oil for 12% off any and for any reason.

1580
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:59.650

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:03.730
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash burn now and get a and get on it.
Okay,

1582
01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.300

I gotta left.
Jesus Christ.
They get out of breath from reading out loud.

1583
01:25:07.301 --> 01:25:09.910
That's how dumb I am.
All right,
seat Geek.
Okay.

1584
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:14.560
Buying tickets online for sports and concerts has been a confusing process for a

1585
01:25:14.561 --> 01:25:18.910
long time.
Now there's nothing confusing about it.
It cost a fucking fortune.
Um,

1586
01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:22.480
it's always hard to find the best deal for that game or show you want to go to

1587
01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:24.940
and none of those older tickets sites want to change that.

1588
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.040
But see geek is different.

1589
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.480
They've come along and create an amazing APP and website that makes it easier

1590
01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.800
than ever.
Then Abba for fans to buy and sell tickets.

1591
01:25:35.801 --> 01:25:40.480
Seek does all the price comparisons for you by searching multiple tickets sites

1592
01:25:40.481 --> 01:25:45.100

1593
01:25:45.101 --> 01:25:49.000
the best move,
the best bang for your buck.
That's why even ticket.

1594
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:54.130
That's why every ticket on Siki is given a grade based on value.

You'll immediately see any underpriced seats and be able to find the best deals

All right.
Oh Jesus.

1630
01:28:15.671 --> 01:28:20.320
It's track.
We're all loses.
Newsweek reports.

1631
01:28:20.321 --> 01:28:24.280
The average American wastes 55 minutes a day looking for things they owned but

1632
01:28:24.281 --> 01:28:28.150
can't find.
Share a story when you've lost something you needed.
Yeah,

1633
01:28:28.151 --> 01:28:30.520
I lost my soul when I fucking do something like that.

1634

Just give me the copy and I'll fucking read it.
Oh yeah.
I remember the time.

1635
01:28:34.001 --> 01:28:38.350
I couldn't find my mittens.
