00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.550
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:07.810
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
And

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.350
just checking in on you.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.320
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.640
<v 1>Just checking in on you.
However the fuck I used to do it.
Uh,
my warrior,</v>

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.850
I am in Winnipeg,
Canada.

7
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.580
I didn't bring all my recording equipment,

8
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.030
so I got to figure the level here that I can talk close to this thing without

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.780
fucking up yours.
I'm in Winnipeg,
Canada.
And guess what?
It's still cold.

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.330
It's May 18th and it's like 42 degrees out,
which is,
it's annoying.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
Why does it keep making that noise?
I'm not getting any closer to him.
Oh,

12
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:45.570
it's the wind.
Ah,
I see.
Keep it steady.
I just rested on my chest.

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
Well that work.
How's that?
Okay,
good.
Anyways,

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.450
it's like 43 fucking degrees out,
you know,

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.600
which isn't cold for the wintertime,
but for me it's fucking annoying.

16
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.500
You know?
And I didn't dress properly.
I came up here with a win fucking break.

17
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:08.010
Yeah.
And uh,
you know,
just walking around,
having a zip up,

18
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.480
my God damn coach or noise.
Oh Bill,
fuck you.
Everything and noise.
You.
Well,

19
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:16.800
maybe you're right.
Maybe it does.
Maybe it does.
Um,
I don't know what I'm just,

20
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.530
I'm just gonna hold this fucking record.
Um,
I'll tell you,

21
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:24.270
you know what's fucking overrated by the way?
Breakfast,
potatoes,

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.240
breakfast potatoes,
Cole slaw,
beans and rice.

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.243
All right?

24
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.790
All of them just taken up a fucking chair on the bench that someone else who

25
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:44.360
wants to get in the fucking game could be,
you know,
you just
dump all,

26
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:48.620
like the like just rebuild,
start over again.

27
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.940
Like the fucking capitals,
you know,
play fillers,

28
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.450
that's all it is.
Fuck.
Breakfast potatoes,

29
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.580
they never taste good and they just make you fat and you feel like you got to

30
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:03.500
eat them because your mother was always like,
well,

31
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.200
if you don't fucking finish that,
you're going to sit there until the morning.

32
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:10.550
And he just sat there,
right?
Watching the ketchup dry,
um,

33
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.410
turned in that it actually starts,
you know,
coagulating Cetera.

34
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:18.770
Is that the right word?
Um,
anyways,

35
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.680
I don't understand why this fucking record is going to have to be like this,

36
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.870
making all this racket.
So I'm trying to be a grump here.
Um,

37
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:31.550
so I'm in Winnepeg tonight for two,
two shows.
Um,

38
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.390
and then I go up to Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan,

39
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.420
scas,
Saskatchewan,
right.
Um,

40
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.180
also known as the Paris of the prairies,

41
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.210
which to me is the greatest fucking nickname of a city than I can.

42
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.790
What do you,
what do you want again?
The big apple that stinks.

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.630
Beantown horrific.
The Berg.

44
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.340
Terrible.
Does la even have a nickname?

45
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.010
Trying to think of yellow ones.
The land.

46
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.200
Cleveland.
Ugh.

47
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.930
That whole fucking thing where all of a sudden every goddamn city needed,

48
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:16.860
I know you always talk about this,
but I'll never get over that.
The awful low,

49
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.090
is that what they called Buffalo?

50
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.530
The Paris of the prairie's.
How great is that?

51
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.040
You know what I mean?
See e you're going out there.
It's,

52
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.530
the prayer is it's going to be a little mom and pop type of shit,

53
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:32.520
but it's going to be beautiful.

54
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.030
I'm going there and then we go down to Regina afterwards,

55
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:42.840
which I believe,
yeah.
What's the nickname?
Watch city.

56
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.390
Is that what it is?
Something like that or was that the Golden State Warriors?

57
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.980
I Dunno.

58
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.770
Speaking of which I s the only way you can root for the Golden State Warriors is

59
00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:56.590
if you bet on them or if you're from the Golden State,
Oakland,
you know,

60
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.300
area and you're already a fan of Jesus Christ.

61
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.390
It was already bad enough to rent piled on there and killed the OKC golden state

62
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:08.250
rivalry,
which is what we be watching right now.

63
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.560
<v 0>Okay?</v>

64
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.393
<v 1>Instead,</v>

65
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.150
you're literally listening to announcements like last night when the Celtics

66
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:13.571
were playing,

67
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:16.840
Reggie Miller is like going because they're trying to sell this series going

68
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.110
like,
oh,
you know,
the only one book pen.
I mean,
some of them was good.

69
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.650
Would you tell him point at Reggie Miller goes,
goes,
look,

70
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.490
we both know there's two meteors head that one another and we're just gonna

71
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.480
Watch him collide.

72
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.580
So I'm trying to do the last time I watched the eastern and Western conference

73
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.880
finals and they felt like the first round of the playoffs.

74
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.410
I'm fucking warriors.
Oh my God,
they're filthy.

75
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.570
Filthy.
I love Popovich.
Going off on that fucking goof,

76
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.920
how many slides,
steps did he fucking take?

77
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

78
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.030
<v 1>To make sure his foot was going to be in the vicinity of where Leonard was going</v>

79
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:58.810
to land.
And for somebody out there who doesn't think that that's filthy,

80
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:03.730
give me a fucking break.
Give me a break.
He's taking a shot.
You know,

81
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.740
why did he have to take that last little slide step,
skip,
skip,
skip,

82
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.570
and then just have his fucking foot right there.

83
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.890
It'd be one thing if they couldn't do like an entire highlight reel of him not

84
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.300
only being a dirty bastard,

85
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:19.960
but actually trying to fucking whatever pop,

86
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.520
what's his face as Leonard shoulder out or whatever the hell he was doing that

87
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.210
time when he dragged them down to the ground.
He's a piece of shit.

88
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.690
And the only thing worse than that fucking move that he made was that awful

89
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:33.310
little dead three skip and a hop thing that he did afterwards as he was holding

90
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:37.260
onto his head.
Like he couldn't fucking believe it.
Um,

91
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.910
well listen,
what the fuck do I know about who?

92
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:42.790
But I know Popovich knows a lot about hoop and I know he's gone through a lot of

93
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:44.980
shit and he's gone through a lot of playoff series.

94
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.570
I ain't never seen him go off like that,

95
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:51.190
so I'm going to go with what he said as opposed to when I was watching ESPN and

96
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.450
the fucking sports anchor,
it goes to Steven A.
Smith.
Hey Steven.
You know,

97
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.130
we've both played the game a,
do you think

98
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.960
it is fucking anchor sitting there?
You know,

99
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.350
he's going to question Popovich and Steven,

100
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.200
a Smith who I love was just like,
he basically said,

101
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.600
what I'm saying with Popovich says,
it's true then.
Yeah,

102
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.660
you kinda got to go with that.
But,
um,

103
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.770
the biggest fucking story and hoop had already came and went because the fucking

104
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:22.610
Cavaliers series with the Celtics already started and they fucking kicked our

105
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:24.360
ass.
Um,

106
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.740
was I owe a certain member of the Boston Celtics a big apology.

107
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

108
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.100
<v 1>All of this time doubting him,
you know,</v>

109
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.500
making fun of his choice of sneakers,

110
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.600
making fun of the way he looked in those sneakers,

111
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.720
talking about how many times he was on the wrong side of the poster.
Kelly.
Oh,

112
00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:47.340
fucking LAENNEC.

113
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.740
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.573
<v 1>What happened?</v>

115
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.860
<v 1>The man simply took over the game in a fourth quarter of a game.</v>

117
00:06:56.831 --> 00:07:01.210
Seven for the Boston Celtics wearing in the green and white

118
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.320
shades of,
of Cedric Maxwell.

119
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.650
But one game we say,

120
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.080
just get on my back cause I'm fucking taking this thing home.

121
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:16.610
And that's exactly what he did.
Guys scored 14 points in the,
uh,

122
00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.350
the fourth quarter

123
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.960
he took Isaiah is Thomas his watch off and put it on his own fucking wrist and

124
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:28.170
I'll put down the court.
He went,
he was back in guys down.

125
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.630
He was fucking dunk.
Eddie was layups.
He was hitting trees.

126
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.570
It's unfucking believable.
Now having said that,
he did it once.

127
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.930
So game one of the cavalier series,

128
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.050
he was right back to the Kelly Olynyk that we know.
You know,

129
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.180
I think that was a very special episode.

130
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.160
You know how they used to do that with Sitcoms,
a very special episode.

131
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:59.120
They would always take on like pregnancy,
abortion,
uh,

132
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:00.740
racism or something like that.

133
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.770
And then they would go right back to being in an all white show.
You know,

134
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.620
that's how white people cared in the 80s.
That's how we did it.

135
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.930
We didn't have to do anymore than that.
That's all that there was.

136
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.010
Um,
so whenever I Kelly Olynyk Jesus Christ,

137
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:18.290
so I guess he's not going to do shit in this series until it,

138
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:22.040
unless we get it to game seven.
Um,

139
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.920
Celtics got the number one pick.
I mean,
it's just all,

140
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.810
that's all we got.
All we got to do now is just wait until Lebron gets old.

141
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.100
And uh,

142
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:39.100
I actually hate the fucking warriors so much that I don't care if they,

143
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.440
if,
if the fucking Cavaliers sweep the Celtics

144
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.950
because I want them nice and rested when they play those fucking dark bags out

145
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:49.290
there.

146
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.280
Who's that other guy that got on the team where he g e you go to garden and he

147
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:56.670
jumps up to take a jump shot and he kicked you in the balls.

148
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.070
He's kicked like half the league and the balls.

149
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.680
I'm going to buy a half the league.
I mean like three or four different guys.

150
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.570
After a while it's like dude that she move.

151
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.870
I love ESPN.

152
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:11.850
Went to him to ask them if they thought that fucking that fucking Nazi Guard

153
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.710
House fucking guy that got there.
You know,
asked him if he thought he was dirty.

154
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.380
The Guy who accidentally kicks people in the balls.

155
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.060
Do you think his teammates dirty?
Yeah.
Well what would you rather have?

156
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.260
Would you have that but twisted ankle or rub you fucking balls separated for the

157
00:09:29.261 --> 00:09:33.640
next nine years?
Um,
anyways,

158
00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:36.850
I don't know why.
I don't know why Chris Paul couldn't go to the Lakers,

159
00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:39.190
but Kevin Duran could go to the,
to the fucking

160
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.970
the warriors and now that,
now that the worries are filthy,
your shit,

161
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.200
they took Leonard out of the series.
It's just,
it's a joke.

162
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.130
I would rather watch the real housewives than the western conference finals in

163
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.790
the NBA.
Um,
so anyways,
enough about that shit.

164
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.273
<v 3>MMM.</v>

165
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.380
<v 1>Type in my password here,
dude.
What the fuck's going on with the Ottawa senators?</v>

166
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.770
When are they going to start behaving like the Ottawa senators?

167
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:12.170
I don't get what's going on here.
You know,

168
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:15.140
I still think the penguins are going to beat him every time.

169
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:17.810
Like the penguins get the fucking shit kicked out of.
And then what happens?

170
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:23.270
They come back,
they give you the old right there,
Fred.
And they fucking,
when the,

171
00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:26.980
uh,
they,
when the series,
um,

172
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.550
I still think that they're going to take the whole thing.

173
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.173
<v 3>MMM.</v>

174
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.260
<v 1>Now here's something I wanted to talk to you guys about.
My,</v>

175
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.580
I just flew up here to fucking Winnipeg and I don't know what happened,

176
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.090
but the fucking level of animal that was on my flight to this guy next to me,

177
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.760
you know,
I told you I've right up front,
I even call it first class.

178
00:10:55.761 --> 00:10:58.430
It's just human class.
They treat you like a human being.

179
00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:00.700
That's all that happens up front.
If you ever wanted,

180
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.130
they don't s smash you all on the back and all that shit,
right?

181
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.560
So I'm waiting to get on,
right?
So they had people with wheelchairs,

182
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.720
they get on first and you know,

183
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.670
fucking people with kids.
If you're in the military,
you know,

184
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.750
if you're wearing a red shirt,
they've got like a bunch of things,
right?

185
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:24.680
So people were sitting in first class to getting all huffy going wins first

186
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:26.030
class going to board,
right?

187
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.100
You know that white guy with the loafers and no socks,
like dead fucking energy,

188
00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:34.934
right?

189
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:40.040
So we're going to get on in this fucking fat fuck,

190
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.570
you know,
in his twenties just completely blown out.
Body,

191
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.930
big giant fat boys.
I'm a polywood producer,
fucking glass,

192
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:53.920
his stupid hat wearing sweatpants and some big comfy fucking shirt,

193
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.340
you know,
just giving into the fact that's why he's fat.

194
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.680
All these fat people that wear comfortable clothes,

195
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.440
you're going to be fat forever cause you,
cause you never,

196
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:03.610
you're not uncomfortable.

197
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.080
You got to keep the clothes that you had when you were that way.

198
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.890
You don't go to the fucking dry cleaner or go to the God Damn Nike store and buy

199
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:15.850
yourself a giant fucking sleeping bag with drawstrings on it.

200
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:19.870
Cause you're never gonna really feel how fat you are until you go to get on a

201
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:20.920
fucking airplane.

202
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.643
<v 3>Right.</v>

203
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.140
<v 1>So I'm the,
so this guy is trying to cut the fucking line,
right.</v>

204
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.983
<v 3>And uh,</v>

205
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.260
<v 1>you know,
I sold a box him out.</v>

206
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.010
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

207
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:33.491
<v 1>And uh,</v>

208
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:38.491
they scanned my thing and I get a call to get on the flight and this fucking fat

209
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:43.090
fuck comes down the thing.
And he literally,
he gets on the plane,
he goes,

210
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.690
where am I sitting up front?
Like really?
Like,
like weird.

211
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.020
Like you can't just look gates and lady like it looks at the ticket and he's

212
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.310
fucking sitting right next to me.

213
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.950
So I'm putting my shit in the overhead compartment.

214
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.970
It's go shoes with a fucking caused the brush right by me.
I said,
hey buddy,

215
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:03.650
I go watch out from my bag.
He's like,
oh,
sorry.
He kind of backed back out again.

216
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.040
You know,
he wasn't gonna hit my bag.

217
00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:09.050
I just didn't like how he fucking brushed right by me.
Right.
So he sits down,

218
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.040
right.
Giant fucking snowman looking Douche bag right.

219
00:13:13.041 --> 00:13:17.030
Sits down and he's so fat.
I'm in first class,

220
00:13:17.031 --> 00:13:21.750
he's still spilling into my seat fucking elbow in me and all that stuff is shit.

221
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.340
Just like,
this is not what I'm spending my sky miles on,

222
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.550
you know.
So,
um,
the lady,

223
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.490
the stewardess comes over,
she goes,
you know frank,

224
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.790
get you guys something to drink,
right?
I order a drink and the guy goes,

225
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.840
can I have a blanket?
They go,
she goes,
yes.
So when she comes up with a blanket,

226
00:13:41.841 --> 00:13:42.860
she holds it out to him.

227
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.030
He just fucking rips it out of her hand and was like opened it up.

228
00:13:47.031 --> 00:13:51.470
And just the way he was so choppy and like aggressive yet couldn't find his
seat.

229
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.300
I was like,
this guy,
I don't know what this is.
I don't know what the fuck this,

230
00:13:56.301 --> 00:14:00.310
this,
this guy on drugs.
Is He autistic?
Is it Asperger?

231
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.100
I don't fucking know cause I don't really know what the symptoms of any of that

232
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:06.730
shit is.
You know,
I saw the rain man and uh,
you know,

233
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.940
I don't know what else I fucking went our podcasts the one time with somebody.

234
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:11.160
That aspect,
I can't fucking tell him.

235
00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:14.280
You just don't know that they act a little off.
All right.

236
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.770
And I'm not going to be yet another douche bag who doesn't have a psychology

237
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:22.570
degree,
let alone practicing that profession to start analyzing someone's mental

238
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.020
situation.
So then he fucking sits there.
Okay.

239
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.820
He rips that the blanket open cause somehow this tub of shit is going to give

240
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:35.050
fucking cold.
And uh,

241
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.060
he starts doing the,
uh,

242
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.930
what's that thing when the restless leg syndrome except his leg weighs as much

243
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:48.470
as my entire body.
So it's like actually shaking the plane and uh,

244
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.530
fortunately it was a red eye and my God,
you know,

245
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.530
let this fucking guy just go to sleep.
But then is he going to have sleep apnea?

246
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.770
I don't know what,
long story short,
we finally ended up,

247
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.540
I connected in Minneapolis.
Okay.

248
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.460
And when I got up,

249
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:07.910
I deliberately stood in a way where he couldn't get out of his seat cause I knew

250
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:10.580
he was going to brush by me.
Once again,
it'd be fucking rude.

251
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.250
Whatever the fuck his deal is.

252
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:19.090
So I passive aggressively stand there.
So I get off the plan,
my grade,

253
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.860
I don't have to fucking deal with this guy anymore.
Right.

254
00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:24.280
So I get off the plane and as I'm standing there trying to figure out where my

255
00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:27.220
connecting flight gate is,

256
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.140
this fucking jerk off comes walking off the plane and he's still wearing the

257
00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:34.710
blanket.
He's got it wrapped around them.
Oh by the way it was so,

258
00:15:34.711 --> 00:15:38.620
so of course wearing sandals,
you know,
like all animals do.
They just,

259
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:43.540
they have to have their feet out.
You know,
like animals,
animals are all barefoot,

260
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.190
they don't have shoes.
Right.

261
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.490
So these guys have sandals cause they're half an animal.
Like,

262
00:15:48.491 --> 00:15:49.060
you know what I mean?

263
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.350
If you're in a hot climate or you fucking at the beach or whatever,

264
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.580
going down to the pool,
the spa that low,
that sandals.
Anyways,

265
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:03.700
so
he comes walking off the plane and then just walks up to the,

266
00:16:03.701 --> 00:16:07.750
you know,
those,
those little fucking cars that they drive fat people around,

267
00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:11.050
an old people,
blind people and stuff,
you know.

268
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.780
And uh,
he walks up to one of those guys to go,
excuse me sir.
He goes,

269
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:20.290
what do I do for the next five hours?
Why wait for my flight and that.

270
00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:25.230
So I was like,
all right,
this guy's,
this guy's fucked up.
And the guy's like,
ah,

271
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.680
I as a food court.

272
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.990
So then he walks up to the ticket lady now just standing there watching him

273
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:37.090
because I got enough time cause now it's entertaining.

274
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.300
Watching him meet people and watching them doing the math on their face,

275
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.060
you know,
is this,
you see it on their face like,
what the fuck am I dealing with?

276
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.610
So he talks to the ticket agent,
freaks her out,

277
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.440
then comes walking back and he walks up to the car and he just goes,
he goes,

278
00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:54.670
sir,
where are you taking me?

279
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.750
And you pop psychologist.
The guy finally just goes,
there's a food court down.

280
00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:04.120
Then they just wandered off,
still wearing the blanket.

281
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.810
Now my buddy that I'm working with this week,

282
00:17:07.811 --> 00:17:11.260
he was trying to say that he thought the guy was on pills.

283
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.120
I have no idea what the fuck it was,
but uh,
it was hilarious.
But anyway,

284
00:17:15.121 --> 00:17:19.030
so the level of fucking animal,
so that guy was there.

285
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.440
There was another guy on my flight,
he was wearing Pajama Pot,
Pajama bottoms,

286
00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:25.270
and he had a neck,
neck,
pillow.

287
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:27.443
<v 0>I mean,</v>

288
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.250
<v 1>I didn't even know where to go from there.</v>

289
00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:33.670
There was another guy who had the worst hat I've ever seen and he was carrying a

290
00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:36.850
hard shell case for the hat.

291
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.420
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

292
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.260
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Well,</v>

293
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:41.900
maybe that was his good hat and he was wearing his bad hat on the flight.

294
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.761
I Dunno.
It's like,
wait,

295
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:48.170
what are you running for president in 1905 and some shit.

296
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:50.500
Like you're riding on a tweet.
It was a fucking hatbox.

297
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.110
We're kind of a man as a hatbox.
It was a solid plastic one,
like,

298
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.130
like a snare drum case.
But as for a fucking hat,
um,

299
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.990
so for whatever reason I get here to the hotel and I'm reading about this plane

300
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:07.230
Crash Air Canada flight six 24,

301
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.430
they say the timeline of the crash,
right?
10 Oh five,

302
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:15.510
the plane leaves 10 56 Air Canada tells flight crew,

303
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.280
<v 3>uh,</v>

304
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.450
<v 1>than an Air Canada flight.</v>

305
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:23.451
It had landed on Halifax runway oh five after a missed approach due to

306
00:18:23.831 --> 00:18:27.400
insufficient visibility because of weather conditions,

307
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:33.610
controller tells the crew to hold at 9,000 feet.
Blahblahblahblah Blah,
blah,
blah.

308
00:18:33.611 --> 00:18:33.881
Right?

309
00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:38.881
The fucking crew asked to confirm to delights Iran setting five controllers,

310
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.670
sets that are on four,
they'll eventually be on five.

311
00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:44.980
They remain on for long story short,

312
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.020
this fucking guy flying this thing,
he ends up hitting like a snow bank.

313
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.260
Some lights,
he's fucking hidden shit off the plane.

314
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.290
They go slide down the runway and they come to a stop.

315
00:18:56.291 --> 00:19:01.291
Says aircraft comes to a rest about 1900 feet beyond the threshold.

316
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:07.220
Okay?
This is like how scary this was.
Um,

317
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.470
captain disconnects the autopilot and plane makes automated calls.

318
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.650
There are a hundred and then 50 feet above the land.

319
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.020
Cope copilot says to pull up,

320
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.160
<v 3>uh,</v>

321
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.210
<v 1>the AC,
the Air Canada's six 24 Sevres and electric power line.</v>

322
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.250
Cutting power to the airport.

323
00:19:25.251 --> 00:19:30.251
Terminal captain advances thrust levers to the takeoff goal round and pulls

324
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:35.570
side.
Stick to the full nose up position.

325
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:41.290
A left main tire hits and approach like 861 feet from the runway threshold.

326
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.720
The main landing gear after lower fuselage and left engine cowling strike the

327
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.610
snow covered ground on an embankment sloping towards the runway.

328
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.340
The plane strikes the localizer and Tena um,

329
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:02.420
and continues airborne before striking the ground twice more and sliding along

330
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:04.160
the runway says what people are dealing with.

331
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.820
You guys ever see that Louis C K episode where they were coming in for landing

332
00:20:07.821 --> 00:20:10.130
and everyone was screaming bloody murder.
That's what I picture.

333
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.700
And I pictured Louis on this flight for whatever reason.
Um,

334
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.100
aircraft comes to a rest 1900 feet beyond the threshold is completely lost.

335
00:20:19.101 --> 00:20:24.101
Power Tower control acts activates crash alarm as passages complete evacuation

336
00:20:25.731 --> 00:20:29.990
firefighters arrived at the accident site.
Now listen to this,
listen to this.

337
00:20:29.991 --> 00:20:34.100
This is at 1236 when the firefighters show up.

338
00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:37.130
This is what they see when the passengers are out on the runway.

339
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:43.060
Now this was a fucking snowstorm that they flew into passengers.

340
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.210
Many wearing open toed shoes,

341
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.260
shorts and tee shirts and carrying baggage is baggage are grouped about 200

342
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:56.380
meters behind the aircraft and frigid temperatures.

343
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.630
Occupants with more severe injuries sit in the emergency vehicles.
I mean,

344
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.880
kind of a fucking asshole gets on a god the of flight in the middle of a snow

345
00:21:07.741 --> 00:21:11.380
storm wearing open toed fucking shoes,
sandals,
shorts.

346
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.880
You know,
next time I get on a flight and I see those people getting on,
I'll,

347
00:21:17.881 --> 00:21:21.160
I'll,
I'm going to be thinking as we go down in the fucking Himalayas,

348
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.810
he's going to be the first people to get eaten,
you know?

349
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.980
Or are they going to be the first people that you're going to have to kill

350
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.010
because they're going to be fighting you for your fucking shoes.

351
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:30.563
<v 3>MMM.</v>

352
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.640
<v 1>I don't even know what the point of all of that was.
All I'm just saying,</v>

353
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:38.720
it's just the level of animal that is at the fucking airport.

354
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.140
And you know what's funny too,
like it's just a way,

355
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.950
when you're walking through an airport,
you can't really see,

356
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.840
you don't really see it.
You know,
like the demographic that you're in,

357
00:21:50.841 --> 00:21:54.530
you don't see it until you get to your gate.
Like

358
00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:01.790
I didn't get the level of animal that was going to fucking Winnipeg until I got

359
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:05.700
to the gate that was flying to Winnipeg because it's like,
you know what I mean?

360
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.120
It's like,
it's like a,
it's like a mixed drink.

361
00:22:09.121 --> 00:22:12.210
He can't taste the fucking alcohol.
Right.
But then when you get to the gate,

362
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.580
when you get to your gate,
wherever the fuck you going,

363
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.100
barring a few tourists too,
we're just going to visit.

364
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.120
That is a straight shot of what the fuck you're,
you're about ready to walk into

365
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.020
Pajama bottoms with a neck pillow.

366
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.043
<v 3>MMM.</v>

367
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.740
<v 1>It's like,
whenever I'm in New York and I'm going to La,</v>

368
00:22:30.741 --> 00:22:32.540
it's like you look at the ear at the airports,

369
00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:35.900
like these people all look like New Yorkers and then all of a sudden you get to

370
00:22:35.901 --> 00:22:40.550
the gate that's going to La and you see the chick with the botox.
You know,

371
00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:42.320
you see the guy with the fake Tan,

372
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.380
he starts seeing the god of your way of dressing.
It's like,
all right,

373
00:22:45.381 --> 00:22:49.430
these la people,
you know,
and then all of a sudden when you get off in la,

374
00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:54.560
they totally blend in with people at the fucking airport.
I Dunno,

375
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.910
I always found that interesting.
Well,
good bill because we did,
I'm sorry,

376
00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.220
I'm sorry.
Hang on a second.
Let me,

377
00:23:01.221 --> 00:23:04.430
let me read some advertising here for this week and uh,

378
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.890
<v 3>yeah.</v>

379
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.630
<v 1>Oh by the way,
then I,
I don't know,</v>

380
00:23:09.631 --> 00:23:11.950
am I going to talk about this first before I go into the advertising?

381
00:23:11.951 --> 00:23:15.250
What's better?
I'll come out of it and talk about it.
All right.
Lift everybody.

382
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.010
L Y,
F,
t.
Uh,

383
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:21.760
when you drive for the right ride sharing app,

384
00:23:21.761 --> 00:23:24.700
every trip can feel like a walk in the park.
With Lyft,

385
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:27.070
you can pick your own hours and work when you want.

386
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.220
Lift can make driving the best job in the world.

387
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.640
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating Pete.

388
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:34.660
It's people better.

389
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:39.760
Lift believes that p being a ride sharing drivers should be fun if you're having

390
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:41.710
a good time.
So are the passengers.

391
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:46.850
If you're choosing a ride sharing company to drive,
sorry,
it's to drive for.

392
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.880
Go with the company that treats you better.
Lift.

393
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:55.070
This is all shade right here.
Lift being all shady.

394
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:59.450
With Uber,
a Lyft offers inap tipping.

395
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.380
When you drive for lip lift,
you keep 100% of the tips.

396
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.560
Drivers had been paid over $150 million in tip since the feature was introduced.

397
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.130
Express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly.

398
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:17.030
Instead of waiting for weeks live tizzies and taking the guesswork out of

399
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:18.890
pickups.
The new app,

400
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.020
the new amp device uses color coding to help passages find their driving's

401
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.530
drivers.
You can earn hundreds of dollars a week.
Plus tips.

402
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.390
Want to make more money,
drive more.

403
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:33.230
It's been never been easier to give yourself a raise.
It's a simple formula.

404
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:35.150
Happy drivers being happy passengers.

405
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.900
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

406
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.260
So join the ride sharing company that believes in treating people better.

Oh good.

410

There's only two.
Oh,
this is great movement.

411
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.670
You guys know movement.
Do you?
I Dunno,

412
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:14.730
they three reinvented the watch business by selling direct to you with over 101

413
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.980
million watches sold today.
I just can't fucking read today.

414
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.810
While they did it again,

415
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.180
except this time was sunglasses and they're going to start selling amber vision.

416
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.570
Oh my God,
everything is so much crisper and clearer.
Uh,

417
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.540
they were tired of having to pay for cheaply,

418
00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:36.400
made throwaway shades or overpriced designer sunglasses.
So they said,
fuck it.

419
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:41.020
We'll make our own starting at just 70 bucks.
Uh,

420
00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.990
talk about your personal experience with the new pair of sunglasses,

421
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.590
which pair you have,
how they look slash feel,

422
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.670
what you enjoy most about it,
how people ask you about it.

423
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.080
What do you want to know,
where you purchased and how much does it cost?

424
00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.630
All right.
None of that happened.
I even know you,
I,

425
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.270
this is the first I'm hearing you guys make sunglasses.
So none of that happened,

426
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.320
but it does seem to get a lot of attention out there on the streets if you start

427
00:26:05.321 --> 00:26:09.160
wearing them.
Um,
so be careful.
If you're not looking for attention,

428
00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:11.180
I wouldn't get these fucking sunglasses.
That's incredible.

429

Everybody.
Um,</v>

462
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.920
rest in peace.
Chris Cornell.
Holy Shit.

463
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.030
<v 3>Unbelievable man.</v>

464
00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:20.450
<v 1>Unbelievable.
One of the best fucking singers in rock history.</v>

465
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.250
And um,
I hope what they're saying,
I mean,

466
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:28.320
I guess if you die you die.
But I just,
I dunno,

467
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.450
I hope they're not going to do all a whole bunch of,

468
00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.340
<v 3>okay.</v>

469
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.540
<v 1>You know how they do that?
They got to kill you again after you die.</v>

470
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.773
<v 3>MMM.</v>

471
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.710
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
What a fucking band.
What a,
what an artist,</v>

472
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.880
what are just did their music?
Just

473
00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.390
the holds up.
You know what I mean?

474
00:28:51.391 --> 00:28:54.250
There's a lot of music that I listened to when I went back,
you know,

475
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.440
and the shit that I used to listen to,
I as a kid was like,
oh my God,

476
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:00.420
this is horrible.
This is the second Barisone.

477
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.130
I still listened to it because of the,
you know,

478
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:04.770
it reminds me of a time in my life when I come up to the red light,

479
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.040
I got to turn it down.
Nothing Chris Cornell over did.

480
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.010
Did you have to turn down?
You could,

481
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:14.880
you could fucking have it cranked and never be embarrassed.

482
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.750
I'm such a huge,
huge fucking loss.
And once again,

483
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.910
someone I should have gone to see,

484
00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:23.760
never did too busy doing this comedy fucking thing.

485
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.480
I was going to go see temple of the dog and I had some other show I couldn't go.

486
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:30.720
I think Dean del Ray had tickets to that.
He was like,
dude,

487
00:29:30.721 --> 00:29:35.460
it was fucking unbelievable.
And um,
yeah,

488
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.220
it's just fucking awful.
Just off.
I was a huge fan of that band.
And uh,

489
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.900
so now what happens?
I know they're in the middle of a tour,

490
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.673
<v 3>you know,</v>

491
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.270
<v 1>you know what they do now is they just find some fucking guy on,</v>

492
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.380
on the Internet that does like an impression of them and then all of a sudden

493
00:29:54.381 --> 00:29:57.910
the guy has to fucking go up there and be like a rock star.
Like,
I,
I,

494
00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.420
I've never seen a band like that.
I've never gone to see a band like that,

495
00:30:02.421 --> 00:30:06.380
although I heard the guy from Alison chains fucking murders it.
So who knows?

496
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.920
Um,
I dunno,

497
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.540
I didn't get out of this.
See,
I just,

498
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:15.720
why I fucking hate talking about sad shit like that.

499
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.833
<v 3>MMM.</v>

500
00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.690
<v 1>Somewhere in all of that,
I saw a fucking way out of this and now I,</v>

501
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:26.700
I don't know what the fuck it is.
So anyways,
uh,

502
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:32.370
plowing ahead,
just fucking plowing ahead.
He,
oh,
I know it was to say,

503
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:32.910
you know what,

504
00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:37.910
I went back and I downloaded skid row's slave to the grind

505
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:45.000
and that album,
that album marked the end of my musical youth,

506
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.700
that album came out in like the summer of [inaudible] 91 and then in September

507
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.010
fucking,
you know,

508
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:57.270
all of a sudden Nirvana's album came out and then that was just,
it,

509
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:02.070
all of my band's got wiped.
They'll fuck off a MTV,

510
00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.310
you know?
And,
um,

511
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.630
<v 3>okay.</v>

512
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:12.550
<v 1>So I went back and I downloaded a slave to the grind monkey business and all</v>

513
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:16.570
that,
which then maybe go watch,
uh,

514
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.530
you know,
a bunch of skid row fucking videos and there's a video man,
Aye,

515
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:27.040
you got to see this shit.
It's from 1991,

516
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.020
I believe.
91 and 92,

517
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:34.080
it's skid row on SNL and Sebastian Bach in the whole band,

518
00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:37.570
just fucking murdering

519
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.510
monkey business.
And
I dunno,

520
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.440
to me that was like for me,
I just feel like I'm doing it now.

521
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.110
I've said it so much that I actually say for me now,

522
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:53.980
I say for me and to me because I keep doing it.
It's like when,

523
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.490
I mean they used to make fun of this guy.
He said,
yeah,
you liked it,

524
00:31:57.491 --> 00:31:59.480
that you liked it,
did that.
And I still,

525
00:31:59.481 --> 00:32:02.200
I kept and we just kept doing it to each other.

526
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.380
And I was in a meeting when pitching his show and I was talking about a comic

527
00:32:07.391 --> 00:32:12.010
that I liked and I said,
yeah,
I saw his special.
Yeah,
I liked it.
I,
and I went,

528
00:32:12.011 --> 00:32:15.100
oh my God.
And it was actually liked it.
And we started going like,

529
00:32:15.101 --> 00:32:18.680
they did it to make it even more ridiculous.
And I literally said liked it,

530
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.660
did it.
And I saw the person's face like,
look at me like,
like,

531
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.660
does he have a stutter?
I can't put this guy on fucking camera.
Um,

532
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.533
anyways,

533
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:36.070
so I'm watching this fucking video and it was the end of like,

534
00:32:37.011 --> 00:32:41.210
aggressive,
fun
fucking bands.

535
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:46.210
Like they would just fucking killing it.
Just it,

536
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:48.980
they will like rock stars.

537
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:53.150
And they were enjoying it before the grunge came in and everyone saying,
God,

538
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.620
I wish I was like,
you,

539
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.430
you muse.
I always hated that fucking line.
So you don't fucking know me.

540
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:05.630
You condescending cunt.
I'm not easily amused.

541
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.350
I don't find what the fuck you trying to suggest about me even remotely a music.

542
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.440
Can somebody please make a video of that Kurt Cobain singing that line and then

543
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:19.300
you cut the joke.
Peshy so what?
I'm like a clown.
I like,
I amuse you.

544
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.363
<v 2>MMM.</v>

545
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.470
<v 1>Anyways,
yeah.
And then all the sad guys came in.</v>

546
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.580
Kurt Cobain fucking uh,
uh,

547
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.460
who's the Pearl Jam Guy,
Eddie vetter,

548
00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.180
that fucking interview that Kurt Loder does with them and he's literally like,

549
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.440
he looks like superman sitting next to fucking Kryptonite.

550
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.790
Like that's how much he's like folded over himself.

551
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.430
Like he didn't want to answer any of the questions.

552
00:33:45.431 --> 00:33:49.600
Like it was literally making a physical reaction to somebody asks him questions

553
00:33:49.601 --> 00:33:52.630
like,
Hey man,
you're selling a bunch of albums that's got to feel good.
Right?

554
00:33:52.631 --> 00:33:56.290
And he was like,
Hey,
it is,
I don't even know how to fucking,
you know what I mean?

555
00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.060
I'm sitting here like the fucking posture of Fiona Apple.

556
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:08.590
They were a bunch of fragile people,
but in the middle of all of that,

557
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:10.430
in the middle,

558
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:15.430
all of that was fucking Chris Cornell still belting it out like a fucking,

559
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.850
I dunno,
my version of what a rock star is,

560
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:25.010
didn't go out there wearing a granny sweater trying to act like he was somebody

561
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:29.330
in the crowd.
It's like,
no,
you're better than me.
Be better than me.

562
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:34.120
I don't want to see me up there
be a fucking God.

563
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.193
<v 2>MMM.</v>

564
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.391
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

565
00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:41.340
And I just thought Chris Cornell had the goods when it came to that and uh,

566
00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.980
it made me go,
I dunno,
I just been listed to a lot of music right around that,

567
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:50.700
that era.
And I've always known it.
I make fun of Nirvana.

568
00:34:50.701 --> 00:34:55.080
I know they're a great band and shit.
I know they are.
I just,
it's just fun.

569
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.470
They're fun to make fun of because everyone's always like,

570
00:34:58.471 --> 00:35:02.580
and when that album came out,
I knew that music,

571
00:35:02.581 --> 00:35:06.630
as I knew it had now changed,
which is complete horseshit.

572
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.930
There was a few people that knew,
most of us didn't like,
who is this new band?

573
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.690
And then all of a sudden it was his other new band and it was just like all of a

574
00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:16.260
sudden MTV decided that they were going to just like,

575
00:35:16.261 --> 00:35:20.130
this was the new shit and they just started spooning it into our mouths and we

576
00:35:20.131 --> 00:35:22.170
fucking hate it.
I mean,
that's basically what happened.

577
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.970
I was more than willing

578
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.140
to watch all those same bands I had been listening to keep,

579
00:35:30.141 --> 00:35:32.600
continue to put out albums.
I didn't have a fucking problem.

580
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.740
You know what it was MTV was done with me.
And uh,

581
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:38.370
that was the first time I really felt dealt.

582
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.160
I was 23 years old and I was just like,
yeah,
that's,
they don't,

583
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:43.680
I'm done as far in their head.

584
00:35:43.681 --> 00:35:47.250
I'm already married with two fucking kids and they can't squeeze a dime out of

585
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:50.190
my pockets,
so fuck this guy.
Right.

586
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:55.140
And then it was smashing Pumpkins,
you know,

587
00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.170
I dunno.

588
00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:00.070
But Soundgarden was always one where I didn't have to make the leap of like,

589
00:36:00.071 --> 00:36:03.280
okay,
this is this new shit.
I just kind of sounds a little different.

590
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.220
Like I absolutely fucking love that band.
Love all the odd time stuff.

591
00:36:09.221 --> 00:36:13.990
I love all of that shit.
And it's just a fucking shame.
It's a fucking shame.

592
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.510
But you know something,
if you want to watch something uplifting,

593
00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.440
I'm going to post.
Um,
skid row was Sebastian Bach,

594
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:24.880
absolutely fucking murdering monkey business.
And,

595
00:36:24.881 --> 00:36:27.300
uh,
I love to,
in the end when he,

596
00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:32.301
he'd after you've just fucking destroys one of the greatest live voices

597
00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:36.580
underrated of all fucking time.
Then he was like,
funny.

598
00:36:36.581 --> 00:36:41.581
In the end I have to like doing those high fucking heavy metals screams all the

599
00:36:42.971 --> 00:36:46.820
way down to the growl and then at the end he's just like,
oh,
thank you very much.

600
00:36:46.821 --> 00:36:48.730
Just like he still thinks it's weird voice.

601
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.820
Uh,
it was awesome.
So anyways,
rest in peace,

602
00:36:54.821 --> 00:36:57.640
Chris Carr now and um,

603
00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.370
I dunno,
I dunno what else to say.
I'm so fucking sick of having to say that,

604
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:05.370
but I guess that's a part of getting old.
Um,

605
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.610
which is something I have to actually talk to you about that talk to you guys

606
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:09.331
about that,
you know,

607
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:11.400
like that thing where you just want to be out to live to be a hundred.

608
00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:15.270
It's like part of living to be 100 is you're going to bury all your friends,

609
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.840
you know,

610
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.160
and you should really start looking at your friends and if you're remotely

611
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:23.880
taking care of yourself,
you,
you know,
which ones are going to go.

612
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:25.830
I hate to say it,

613
00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.210
but you do that fucking guy eating the burgers and the fries and the fucking

614
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.660
just putting on another 10 every year.

615
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.290
Every year the Christmas sweater gets a little bit bigger.
Right.

616
00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:38.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

617
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.610
<v 1>Until next day you're wandering around ordering people around,</v>

618
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:46.020
wearing the fucking airplane blanket through the fucking terminal area.
Yeah.

619
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.570
Like that guy,
that guy I saw,
that guy's not going to be around a lot.

620
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.410
It's not gonna be around long.
You know what I mean?

621
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.250
I think that restless leg syndrome that he had going on,

622
00:37:56.251 --> 00:37:59.820
that was his heart screaming for help.
You know,

623
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.610
I've given them enough chest pains.
He's not listening to me.

624
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:07.611
Can Somebody for the love of God slap the fuck twinkie out of this guy's mouth

625
00:38:07.721 --> 00:38:12.480
up,
Jesus.
But why do you gotta be me?
All right.
So anyways,
I got Winnepeg tonight,

626
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:16.530
then Saskatoon,
the Paris of the prairies,

627
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.980
and then I got fucking,
uh,

628
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:23.610
Regina and I will not do one vagina joke.
I did one of the podcasts,

629
00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:28.050
just cause you know you got to one to watch city,
you have rip city,

630
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.340
you got the twin city and you got to watch city and that's it.

631
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:36.310
So now
this is going to be some nerdy shit.

632
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.420
This isn't even the podcast right now.
Here we go.
Hang on one second.

633
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:44.950
Let me get a fucking map of Canada map of Canada.

634
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.760
Uh,
uh Oh.

635
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.830
Did I ever give the Edmonton fans a shut off the singing the national anthem.

636
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.720
Oh,
come on.
Why does it always go to Wikipedia?
Now

637
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.710
I don't need to know what a map of Kennedy is.

638
00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:03.890
I need to fucking see one map of Canada,

639
00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:08.860
a home and native land.
Cool.

640
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.000
Hate

641
00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:17.290
carb man.
Right here we go visit page.
Now I've got to go to the page

642
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.010
and now I've got to try and make the fucking map bigger.

643
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.000
I want to see a map of Canada.

644
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.223
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

645
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:32.700
<v 1>As I said.
All right.
Yeah,
I have been to with this fucking trip.</v>

646
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.160
As far as the southern portion,
I think I've been to every major city.

647
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:42.600
I got Vancouver,
Calgary,
Edmonton,
Saskatoon,

648
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.470
Regina,
Winnipeg,

649
00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.830
Toronto,
Ottawa,
Montreal.

650
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.880
Then I've been to like Monkton.

651
00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.390
I Bet I went to the maritimes.
I came in with a fuck.

652
00:39:59.391 --> 00:40:03.770
I went something in Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick.
I know I went to New Brunswick,

653
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:08.600
maybe not Nova Scotia.
Um,
I dunno.

654
00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.000
I've been to fucking hammered town.
I've been to London,
Ontario.

655
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.320
<v 4>Okay.</v>

656
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.980
<v 1>I mean,
I think Yellowknife is next.
That's where I got to go next.
I should,</v>

657
00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:24.510
I is all starting Alaska.
I'll do something in the Yukon territory with those.

658
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.430
Fuck him in that place up there.
I can't see.
It's all blurry,
so same Whitesnake.

659
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.140
Is that where the bands from?
I don't know.
I'll put it together,
but this is,

660
00:40:34.141 --> 00:40:35.350
I'm not going to stop,
man.

661
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.850
This was the last province that I needed to go on the southern southern

662
00:40:41.851 --> 00:40:44.460
hemisphere.
What the fuck is it called?
Saskatchewan.
Yeah,

663
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.560
it's Saskatoon in my head.
All right.
That was complete filler.
I don't know why.

664
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:51.660
Just did that.
That was your breakfast potatoes here on the Thursday afternoon,

665
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.790
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
All right.

666
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.140
We're going to play a little music here.

667
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.130
Obviously we can do some sound garden and then you can listen to some,
uh,

668
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.830
another half hour of some greatest hits from a Thursday gone by and another time

669
00:41:04.831 --> 00:41:09.030
or a podcast on Monday.
I don't know what the fuck it is.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

670
00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:10.590
I will.
You guys have a great weekend.

671
00:41:10.591 --> 00:41:14.610
You can't and I will talk to you on Monday and once again,

672
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.790
a rested pieces of great Christmas.

673
00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:45.180
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

674
00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:34.520
<v 6>Hey,
what's up?
It's the Monday morning podcast.</v>

675
00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:36.291
Hey,

676
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:39.950
what's going on with this bill for the Monday morning podcast and this is the

677
00:45:39.951 --> 00:45:43.910
third attempt at trying to be even remotely and musing on the thing.

678
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.200
It was like the sixth time I've tried to start doing this podcast,

679
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:49.820
but what's going on?

680
00:45:49.821 --> 00:45:54.770
It's still doing the Monday morning podcast if you want to please every God damn

681
00:45:54.771 --> 00:45:58.940
week,
every week,
every Monday,
and let this,
uh,
Christmas with some shit.

682
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.450
I don't want to take the day off.
All right.
And I worked for myself.

683
00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.400
Why decide it's a bill barr?
Yeah.

684
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:12.050
Hey,
what's going on?
This is still going on.
It's still birth?
Yeah.

685
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:15.470
Isn't that exciting?
Every Monday?
I do a fucking podcast.
All right,

686
00:46:15.471 --> 00:46:19.060
what do you want from me?
You know,
hey,
what's going on?

687
00:46:19.061 --> 00:46:23.630
She's still birth and a,
this is not the Monday morning podcast.

688
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.550
Hey,
what's up man?

689
00:46:25.551 --> 00:46:30.350
It's still dry and it is the Monday morning podcast and I'm going to be

690
00:46:30.351 --> 00:46:33.470
multitasking this week.
Hey,
what's going on?

691
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:38.210
It is a burn and this is the Monday morning podcast.
Um,

692
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.860
welcome.
Welcome.
If you're new to it.
I do one of these every single Monday.

693
00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:45.160
I answer questions.
People email me quick.

694
00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.910
Is that bucket add thorough people send me in there a underrated overrated list.

695
00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:55.160
Things that they feel are underrated,
things that they feel are overrated.
Hey,

696
00:46:55.161 --> 00:46:58.030
what's going on?
This is so far and this is uh,

697
00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.740
this is the Monday morning podcast.
This is the official one.

698
00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.230
<v 7>You see?
You see,
that's what I was trying to do last week.</v>

699
00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.500
That's what I was trying to do.

700
00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.620
I was trying to slip in the MP three of the week there.

701
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:25.180
That's what I was trying to do there.
Did you enjoy it?
Was it a little bit long?

702
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.900
Did my edits sock?
I'm sure it did.
And I'm,

703
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.210
I'll get emails from people because that's what the web is really all about.

704
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.930
It's not about connecting with other people.

705
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:43.110
It's about having the ability to tell somebody that they fucking suck when

706
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:46.870
they're just sitting there in their underwear,

707
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:51.310
eating a bowl of fucking week checks.
You know?
That's how my day starts.

708
00:47:51.311 --> 00:47:55.960
Every fucking day.
Every day I get up and,
uh,

709
00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.730
well I take my dog for a walk now,
which is fucking awesome.
I do that.

710
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.020
But then,
uh,
wait a minute,
don't I?
I probably do go on my space first.

711
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.050
That's how pathetic I am.
It's how pathetic I am.

712
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:12.380
I will literally get on my space and a,

713
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.020
I checked out a couple emails,

714
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:17.830
a couple of comments on whatever shows I've done something.

715
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:21.460
You saw me on some fucking picture I put up and there's always somebody breaking

716
00:48:21.461 --> 00:48:25.090
my balls over there.
And uh,
that's what the Internet is.

717
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:26.560
That's what the Internet is.

718
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:32.070
It's a bunch of punks being able to heckle people without being able to get

719
00:48:32.771 --> 00:48:36.550
trashed back,
you know?
But I'm guilty of it too.

720
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:39.080
So what the fuck am I going to do?
All right.
It's bill bird,

721
00:48:39.081 --> 00:48:42.240
some Monday morning podcast.
If you didn't know that from the beginning.
Uh,

722
00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.091
the opening there,

723
00:48:43.091 --> 00:48:47.110
that's a new thing I'm going to try to be doing is a MP3 the week.

724
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.480
I don't know if I want to do it every week cause I really,
you know,

725
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.760
I already deal with all the questions you guys send me,

726
00:48:51.761 --> 00:48:56.230
which really crow clogs up my email folders and uh,

727
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.140
but you know,
every once in a while,
so you know,
if you've got a cool idea,

728
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:03.040
send it in.
If it's something I can use on the podcast,
I'll definitely do it.

729
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:08.020
But I got them in,
I'm kinda nervous about getting a fucking,
uh,
a virus,
you know,

730
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.980
listening to all that audio,
you know,
you're not supposed to open shit,

731
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.950
so I don't wanna I don't want to do that,
you know,

732
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.800
so I don't even know what I just fucking told you there.

733
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:19.780
And I'm sure there's people out there right now.

734
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.590
<v 8>Oh,
you were Bulger.</v>

735
00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.450
Novaris opening an audio but not somebody g-mail.

736
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.360
<v 7>Are you that fucking stupid?</v>

737
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:32.260
That's another thing I like about the Internet is when you've just asked people

738
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:37.000
for fucking help that nobody can,
you know,
some people can help you up,

739
00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:38.620
but so many people on the internet,

740
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:43.810
their way of helping you out is to give you information while calling you a

741
00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:44.890
fucking moron,

742
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.870
which is why this week on the Monday morning part podcast,

743
00:49:49.871 --> 00:49:53.020
if you are fans of this,
you know that I have douche bag of the week,

744
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.270
but there was so many douche bags this week.
I almost have to,
I,
I,

745
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.100
I almost was like con to the week.
I almost had to bump it up,

746
00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.963
you know what I mean?

747
00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.560
But I stopped short of that out of respect for some of the female listeners out

748
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:13.360
there.
So I'm going with Douche bags of the week.
That's plural.
All right,

749
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.170
this is it.
It's the last week,
if you,
if you listened.

750
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.730
I did get a dog and a,

751
00:50:20.731 --> 00:50:25.360
I've never had a dog before and I was having issues because,
uh,
whatever,

752
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:28.010
listen to last week's podcast,
I don't have time to fucking get into it,

753
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:32.810
but we had a specialist come over here to find out what the dog's problem was.

754
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:37.280
And evidently it has separation anxiety because,
um,

755
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:39.230
it's a perfect fucking dog.

756
00:50:39.231 --> 00:50:42.290
It doesn't lunge after other dogs doesn't go at lunch after people.

757
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.070
It's fucking mellow.
It just chills out.
But if you leave it alone,

758
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.800
it like freaks,
you know,
or if it anticipates that you're leaving it alone,

759
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:55.550
it starts like shaking uncontrollably and it starts drooling,

760
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.880
which are all signs,
I guess,
that this separation anxiety.

761
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:03.881
So evidently it's this four week fucking process that I have to go through.

762
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.860
But I totally loved the dog now,
so I don't give a fuck.

763
00:51:06.861 --> 00:51:11.540
I literally canceled gigs to make sure this dog is cool.
And um,

764
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.030
it's,
it's a long story.

765
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:18.290
If you want to know what you got to do is basically what I've learned is,

766
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:23.291
is there certain triggers that the dog has that sets it off to freaking out?

767
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.660
Like you grabbing your keys and here's the sound of your keys.

768
00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.790
Or maybe you turn the shower on,

769
00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.960
or your girlfriend starts blow drying her hair or whatever.

770
00:51:32.961 --> 00:51:36.490
Just things like that starts at,
you know,
it starts looking at you.

771
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.600
Then you put your shoes on,
you put your coat on.

772
00:51:38.601 --> 00:51:42.440
And all in all it associates that shit with is,
Oh fuck,

773
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:47.330
I'm being abandoned again.
And you know,
I don't fucking know.

774
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:48.530
I don't write the books.

775
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.040
I don't have the ability to actually know what a dog is thinking.

776
00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:53.090
But I'm imagining,

777
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:57.530
considering that this dog was just left by the La River,

778
00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:59.990
can you believe that someone didn't even bring it to the shelter?

779
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:04.580
They just opened their car door or whatever and just left it out there.
You know,

780
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.270
like,
I don't know what the fuck at eight kills me.
It kills me every time.

781
00:52:08.271 --> 00:52:11.120
I think that someone would do that.
But,
um,

782
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:16.070
so I guess that that's where this dog's mind goes mentally.
So,
uh,

783
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.740
we have to fucking decondition you've got to figure out what it's an,

784
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.730
the very first trigger is,

785
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.900
and then you work your way through all of them and you just do one trigger,

786
00:52:26.901 --> 00:52:28.130
like pick up your keys,

787
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:32.190
sorta walk around with them as you're giving it this food.
I don't even,

788
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.240
I just read the fucking book.
It's,
it's a long goddamn process,

789
00:52:35.241 --> 00:52:38.000
but I'm going to work through it.

790
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:41.010
So that's basically what you're supposed to do in a nutshell.
I'm real.

791
00:52:41.011 --> 00:52:41.690
And you know what I mean?

792
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.390
Do you ever just read something on the Internet and then you try to fucking talk

793
00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:46.010
about it?
Like,
you know what you're talking about?

794
00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:49.070
That's what that last couple of minutes was.
But it's,
it's,
it's,
you know,

795
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.090
I'm fucking,
I'm,
I'm learning about this stuff and I'm gonna,
you know,

796
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:54.410
I'm going to do what I gotta do.

797
00:52:54.411 --> 00:52:57.290
But basically I had been held captive with this dog.

798
00:52:57.291 --> 00:53:02.120
I've been with this fucking dog for the last,
uh,
five days in a row,

799
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.310
other than when I go out to do sets.
But then my girls here,

800
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:05.840
when we just make sure we don't leave it alone,

801
00:53:05.841 --> 00:53:10.250
so it doesn't freak out as we learn how to diffuse.
It's problem.

802
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:11.683
Okay.

803
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:15.680
So last week I was asking people if they have any ideas because I went to put

804
00:53:15.681 --> 00:53:19.040
the thing in a cage,
which was a stupid fucking thing to do.
I just didn't,

805
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.520
I was ignorant.
I didn't know.
I didn't know what the dog's problem was.

806
00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:26.430
I didn't know how to introduce a cage to a dog who's gone through the stuff that

807
00:53:26.431 --> 00:53:29.310
my dog's gone through.
So,
you know,
I made a rookie mistake,

808
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.940
so I was reaching out to my podcast listeners and a,

809
00:53:32.941 --> 00:53:35.870
these are some of the emails.
I got a bill.
Uh,

810
00:53:35.871 --> 00:53:40.320
I've always been in a household with dogs since I was born and I've never had

811
00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:44.610
any of those fucking small female dogs like a Chihuahua.
I mean,

812
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:49.440
I had big male dogs,
German shepherds,
Husky labs,
that type of stuff.

813
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:54.840
And uh,
one of my dogs has broken out of his cage before.
However,

814
00:53:55.050 --> 00:54:00.050
you must not know how to train a dog because my never fucked up the house even

815
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:01.170
when he was young.

816
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:06.390
Dogs are so rowdy and hard to handle when they are young,

817
00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:10.020
they are hyper and they need lots of attention.
By the way,

818
00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:15.050
you really shouldn't have a dog if someone can't be home with it most of the

819
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:19.320
day.
Now,
I don't know about you guys.
I'm stopping halfway through,

820
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:23.910
but that was just packed with information that I didn't know really.

821
00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:27.510
I shouldn't have a dog if someone can't be home with it most of the day.

822
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:31.440
I had no idea.
You know,
I thought I could just get a dog,

823
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:36.000
stick them on the roof of my fucking apartment and leave for seven days.

824
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:40.920
I figured maybe it'll rain,
you know,
and they can just don't,

825
00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:44.130
don't they store water in their bodies like fucking camels.

826
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.920
I have no idea what a fucking douchebag.

827
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:52.020
He's all ready a Douche bag and then he has the balls,

828
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:57.620
the fucking ego wrapped around his balls to write another paragraph of obvious

829
00:54:58.771 --> 00:55:03.420
shit.
Here we go.
Everybody.
Here we go.
I've got a three year old out there.

830
00:55:03.421 --> 00:55:05.970
Maybe they want to listen to the rest of this for this fucking information.

831
00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:08.580
Here is what this fucking Einstein says.
The rest of this,

832
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:12.330
you have to give it affection.
It's like a baby.

833
00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:17.490
She except you don't have to send it to college.
Now he didn't say that part.

834
00:55:17.491 --> 00:55:19.800
All right.
Uh,
she just wants attention.

835
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:24.990
She needs to be walked and petted and played with everyday.
That's right.
Petted.

836
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:27.420
This is the guy who thinks I'm a fucking morning.
Um,

837
00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:31.740
how often do you walk her and pet her and pet her daily?

838
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.850
Were you drunk when you type this?
You already said pet aid in the other thing.

839
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:37.710
Anyways,
he says,
guess what?

840
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:43.340
You do have to fucking build up the trust or the dog isn't going to obey you

841
00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.191
as that.

842
00:55:47.191 --> 00:55:51.240
That right there in a nutshell is how people give advice on the Internet.

843
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.040
Guess what?
Hey Fuck.
Head like that whole vibe.

844
00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:00.540
It just blows my mind why someone can't be like,
Oh hey,
I got a dog.

845
00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.450
This is the stuff I went through and this is kind of what I tried.

846
00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.470
Hope it works every he's got,
everybody's got,
not everybody,

847
00:56:07.471 --> 00:56:12.330
but so many people came at me like I couldn't believe it.
So anyways,
he says,

848
00:56:12.331 --> 00:56:13.270
guess what?

849
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:18.720
You do have to fucking build up trust or the dog isn't going to obey you.

850
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.070
Really,
really?
I have no idea.

851
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.040
I thought I was like fucking Tarzan.

852
00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:31.600
I could just start communicate or fucking doctor Doolittle.
What an asshole.

853
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:33.180
You're an asshole.

854
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.610
Douche bag and con to the week and I haven't even finished your fucking email.

855
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:42.310
All right,
I'm continuing.
Um,
alright.
What the fuck?

856
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:45.220
Why can't even get through this sentence?
Guess what your Blah Blah Blah.

857
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:50.050
And she's going to find every way she can to break loose when she's confined and

858
00:56:50.051 --> 00:56:52.810
you're not home.
My lab is 13 years old,

859
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:57.400
but he still needs to play and be petted,
I think.

860
00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.960
Is it petted?
It needs to be pet you dumb.
Fuck.

861
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:05.470
That's not even a word.
Hey,
fuck head.
Now I'm doing it.

862
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.350
I'm just pissed because you're coming at me like does she a cunt?

863
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.830
I just asked you for advice,
you know,

864
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.730
thank God you don't teach kids anyways.
Uh,

865
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:18.250
if yours is whimpering at night,

866
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:23.020
it's most likely she didn't get much interaction.
Feels lonely.

867
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:28.210
Three e's and fields.
By the way,
I don't think you should have a dog bill.

868
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:32.680
Really?
I don't think you should have a computer.
What do you think about that?

869
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:34.990
How about that?
Fuck head.
I don't think you should have a queue.

870
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:36.670
You shove a fucking computer screen,

871
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.420
but not a keyboard and maybe a secretary.

872
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:45.520
I learned nothing in that.
All right.
First of all,
Douche bag or the week.

873
00:57:45.521 --> 00:57:50.521
Why would you think that you could even begin to analyze what is wrong with this

874
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:52.510
dog without ever meeting it?

875
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:57.520
You're basically superimposing the dogs you had in your life over this dog.

876
00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:02.410
Did any of the dogs you have get left by a fucking river for God knows how many

877
00:58:02.411 --> 00:58:06.710
fucking days now you know he's just going to make it up.
Well,
Yost job,

878
00:58:06.711 --> 00:58:10.650
my Labrador was worth by biopharm phone.

879
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:14.830
Do dogs need attention?
Do you understand?
I mean,

880
00:58:14.831 --> 00:58:16.840
I guess because I didn't explain it.
You've got to understand,

881
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.840
I've been giving this dog so much attention.
It's,

882
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:22.990
it's affecting my relationship with my girlfriend.

883
00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:29.200
Okay?
She has all she could do to get me to cuddle with her,

884
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:30.400
but I have literally been late.

885
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:35.140
I can't walk to the fridge without laying down on the floor with that fucking

886
00:58:35.141 --> 00:58:39.310
dog and telling her how awesome it is for like 20 minutes every time.

887
00:58:39.311 --> 00:58:42.520
I'm not getting anything done.
A write,
you fucking moron.
I've had dogs.

888
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:47.460
I also grew up with dogs.
I was just asking for help.
All right?

889
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:52.250
You can't stop acting like everyone in my family.
Jesus Christ.
You know what?
I,

890
00:58:52.251 --> 00:58:53.980
I feel so much better about my family.

891
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:57.600
Some of these fucking emails I didn't want to be,
I didn't want to be angry.

892
00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:00.910
Look at this,
what this is doing to me.
All right,

893
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:04.000
here's the second Douche bag of the week he'll ever contest.

894
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.210
Which one of these two people do you think is a bigger douchebag this way or are

895
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:10.870
they both?
Cons.
All right,
here we go.
There's a second email.
First off,

896
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:14.640
I really enjoy your comedy and your Monday morning podcast when you don't target

897
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:19.270
out and post it on time.
That part doesn't even make sense.

898
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:24.750
So you enjoy when I don't tart out and post it on time,

899
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.750
I don't get,
Oh,
when I don't tart out,
when I'm not a moron,
and I posted on time.

900
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:33.320
Okay,
maybe that's me.
All right,
second.
So he starts off nice or she,

901
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:38.000
I don't even know who the fuck wrote this.
Second,
try not using a fucking cage.

902
00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:39.320
A duh.

903
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:47.540
I swear to God and adult rock debt.
Second,

904
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.070
try not using a fucking cage.
A duh.
Now,

905
00:59:52.071 --> 00:59:55.490
why would you think the reader at this point would remotely give a,

906
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.760
you could be telling me how to win $1 million in this paragraph.

907
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.790
The second you come at me,
this condescendingly I'm not,

908
01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:05.480
I don't give a fuck what you have to say,
but for the sake of my listeners,

909
01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:09.140
I'm going to read the rest of this.
All right?
You fucking,

910
01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:14.900
I need a new cord for can't.
There's so many concerts week.

911
01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:19.130
All right,
let's start over again with that sentence.
Second,

912
01:00:19.131 --> 01:00:21.620
try not using a fucking cage.
A De,

913
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.090
as long as you keep small objects in and your trash away from the dogs reach,

914
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:30.590
you can get the dog to pass out.
Most of the time you're away.
Once again,

915
01:00:30.591 --> 01:00:32.750
here's a guy who has no idea what I'm dealing with.

916
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:37.130
Any completely writes off cages.
You know,

917
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:40.190
all these people you see at the airport where the dogs in one of those fucking

918
01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:43.640
cages and they don't have a problem with it because they introduced the cage in

919
01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:47.630
a proper way rather than the stupid way that I did it at the pet store or I

920
01:00:47.631 --> 01:00:52.290
tried to figure out if the dog could fit into it by pushing it by head first.

921
01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:56.750
As I'm pushing its ass as it's using all its pit bull muscle on the linoleum to

922
01:00:56.751 --> 01:01:01.400
be like,
Eh,
I don't feel like going in there.
You know,
whatever.

923
01:01:01.401 --> 01:01:04.250
I'm not good with spatial relations.
I did what I had to do.
Um,

924
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.120
okay,
let's continue.
Um,
uh,
as we,

925
01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.630
the first week of trying to figure out the new section,

926
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.180
who's a bigger douche bag.
Sorry,
let me read the rest of this year.
Um,

927
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.430
finding a proper dog toy is necessary but avoid anything that can be eaten and

928
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:27.410
salivated on dash raw heights.
Now there's almost some information.

929
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:31.130
So I know I don't need raw hides.
I don't know why he's a,

930
01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:35.930
he hasn't really told me why,
but I guess I just avoid those.
Um,

931
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:40.790
this is like getting sex education in like the forties,
you know,

932
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.420
when no one could fucking talk about it.
This is brutal.
All right.

933
01:01:44.421 --> 01:01:45.750
Instead of all the,

934
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:50.270
that time you wasted teaching the dog to be comfortable in an in comfortable

935
01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:53.120
place and uncomfortable place.
He's talking about the cage.

936
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.690
You could have been teaching it to behave in the household.

937
01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:00.830
Really?
Oh,
I had no idea.

938
01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.720
It's not like I walked in into the fucking apartment and just shoved it into a

939
01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:10.520
cage.
You fucking idiot.
I had it on the leash.
I walked at all around the house.

940
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:14.310
Everything was going great,
everything was going great.
And then it had some bet,

941
01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:17.720
had bad experiences with the cages and then it won't go in the room where the

942
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:22.700
cage was because it had a bad experience in there.
Jesus,
fuck,

943
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:24.210
I know I'm sick of these dog whisperer.

944
01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:26.470
People Watch fucking 10 episodes and then they think they,

945
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:30.360
they can like fucking put their hand on top of your dog and cure it.

946
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.340
I don't know,
not that you care,

947
01:02:32.341 --> 01:02:37.110
but my friend of 10 years has had two pit bulls in a house area smaller than my

948
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:41.010
one bedroom apartment and it doesn't destroy anything that you don't allow it to

949
01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:45.510
destroy for every failed attempt of taking a dog in a dog,

950
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:50.430
there is a flunky of an owner.
Evidently that's me.
You don't even have kids.

951
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.790
You can definitely do this bill.
See that's positive,

952
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:59.460
have patience and understanding and that dog will give you unconditional love

953
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.220
for many years.
All right.
You know this guy is like,

954
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:06.060
this is like a battered wife fucking email.
He starts off nice,

955
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.780
sucks me in for a software.
Really enjoy your comedy.
Monday morning podcasts.

956
01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:12.570
I'm like,
yeah,
you have.
Really as I'm sticking my chin out,

957
01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:17.310
then he gives me a fucking uppercut,
try not use in a fucking cage.
Uh,
Duh.
Right?

958
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.540
And then he trashes me,
basically alludes to the fact that I'm a flunky,

959
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.180
maybe a flunky owner.
I Dunno.
And then,

960
01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:26.330
and then he starts stroking my head when I,
and I'm like,

961
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.820
you know what amount of this relationship,
I'm going back home to my father.

962
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:31.980
I don't need this anymore.
And then he says,

963
01:03:31.981 --> 01:03:35.130
now they'll have patients and understanding the dark,
you know,

964
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.820
you look beautiful and your little Dickie shorts

965
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.880
anyways.
You know,
something,
you animal lovers,
you're out of your fucking minds.

966
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:45.631
That's all I can say.

967
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:49.590
You got more goddamn passion for animals than you do for losing your fucking

968
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.820
conveniences in this country.
You know what I mean?

969
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.080
They'll fucking stand there and continue to pay $15 for their first fucking bag.

970
01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.910
Even though the price of gas has come down.

971
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:03.420
You can never get them to sign a fucking petition.
But Jesus Christ,

972
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:07.530
if somebody throws an errand frisbee and it hits a fucking shower in the side of

973
01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:11.620
it's fucking leg,
there'll be hate.
There'll be fucking making software.

974
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.990
We have people with signs.
If I have,

975
01:04:12.991 --> 01:04:17.991
if somebody from the goddamn animal shelter ever heard my last podcast,

976
01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:22.950
I probably have protestors outside my next funnybone Gig.
So anyways,

977
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.280
I want to thank everyone who actually sent me advice trying to help me out.

978
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:31.710
Okay.
I'm not a bad dog owner.
Okay.

979
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:36.180
I just didn't understand what the dog was going through.
Okay.
And it's,
you know,

980
01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:37.320
it's head too.

981
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:42.060
It's had three really traumatic events since I've had it just out of my own

982
01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:43.260
ignorance.
Okay.

983
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:47.820
I put it in two different cages because I didn't understand why it was clogging

984
01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:52.170
up my apartment.
I just thought it was doing what dogs do,
you know.

985
01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:54.870
And once again,
I didn't fucking decide to get a dog.

986
01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:58.470
My girlfriend has brought this thing home.
So we had our lives to lead.

987
01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:02.780
So that was a horrific experience.
And one day when we left,
we left a daughter,

988
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:06.360
our balcony open and this kills me to say this,

989
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.570
it walked out on the balcony and the wind blew the door shut and was stuck out

990
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:11.640
there for like 40 minutes.
And when we got there,

991
01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.630
it was standing there trembling and drew,
it was fucking,
it was horrific.

992
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:20.380
And uh,
I,
I,
you know,
I felt like I didn't deserve a dog.

993
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.150
Uh,
so since then,
no,
I take it for hikes every day.

994
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.530
It just to make you fucking dog lovers relax.

995
01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:33.820
Okay.
I swear to God.
All right.
I just watched,
I was,
you know,

996
01:05:33.821 --> 01:05:35.770
I'm actually doing this,
this podcast by the way,

997
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.780
on a Sunday evening here because I want to make sure I was able to edit that

998
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:42.400
thing on the front and do everything right.

999
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:45.010
So people on the east coast wouldn't have to wait till the end of the fucking

1000
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:48.430
day to listen to this thing.
But um,
you know,

1001
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.840
I want to go play drums.
I wanted to play drums for three fucking days,

1002
01:05:52.841 --> 01:05:55.210
but I refuse to leave this dog alone.

1003
01:05:55.540 --> 01:06:00.540
I refuse for this dog to have another bad experience due to me on my watch.

1004
01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:04.630
So all you guys can relax and if you want to give me advice,

1005
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.190
give me advice.
But I don't need advice that begins with hey shit,
Dick,

1006
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.480
or whatever that you know,

1007
01:06:10.481 --> 01:06:14.920
cause that really as you can tell it all it does is fucking annoying me,

1008
01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:20.380
you know,
and I combined that,
you know,
I thought I had a great week.
You know,

1009
01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.030
I gave you guys a podcast.

1010
01:06:22.031 --> 01:06:26.440
I put a new video up on my myspace page and on my youtube page,

1011
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:30.190
by the way,
which I don't have the fucking name for,

1012
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:33.520
I forget the name of it,
but a,
I put it up there.

1013
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:38.440
I put up like fucking 30 new photos.
What else did I do?

1014
01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:40.960
So that was a video.
I gave you a podcast,

1015
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:46.330
I gave you new pictures and I had been,
I blogged all week for the NHL.

1016
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.620
You know,
by the way,
congratulations to the Carolina hurricanes.

1017
01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:54.330
He has sons of bitches a best for checking.
I've,

1018
01:06:54.331 --> 01:06:58.930
I've seen on a hockey team and a long fucking time.
You guys were phenomenal.

1019
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.650
You deserve to wear it and a good lucks against the penguins.

1020
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.450
You sons of bitches and uh,
anybody who took my blog seriously,

1021
01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.890
uh,
you can go fuck yourself because,
uh,

1022
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:16.780
it says in the thing that I'm a comedian,
so if you take my job seriously,
I,

1023
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:19.710
I can't,
I can't help you,
you know?

1024
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.820
You know what I mean?
I,

1025
01:07:23.821 --> 01:07:28.000
I'm trying to fucking come up with an analogy here.
You know,

1026
01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:31.570
I don't expect the Weatherman to be funny,
you know,

1027
01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.270
and I don't expect the comedian to be seriously serious.

1028
01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:37.600
So if they write something fucked up that obviously they're joking.

1029
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:43.060
So all those references I made you guys not having shoes and

1030
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:51.730
in play and washboards and tubs in the stands and fucking,
you know,

1031
01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:54.490
not being real hockey fans cause you're from down south.

1032
01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:56.380
If you took any of that seriously,

1033
01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:01.150
then you really are the moron that I was jokingly saying that you were.
Okay.

1034
01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.810
You know why I was referring to you as the Hartford whalers.
All right.

1035
01:08:04.811 --> 01:08:08.650
I was having fun.
I was just talking shit.
You know,

1036
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:12.760
unless I say it about Montreal Canadien fans,
that's the only time I mean it,

1037
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:15.010
you know,
but even then I'll give it,

1038
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.940
they get a beautiful city with gorgeous women.
Um,
all right,
so there you go.

1039
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:24.380
So onto the podcast here and I'm basically going to be reading a bunch of shit

1040
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:27.740
that I read last week but wasn't able to,
uh,
to update.

1041
01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:29.310
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1042
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:34.600
<v 7>why the fuck am I,
uh,
what are we going to do here?
What am I get to?
Uh,</v>

1043
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:38.170
some of the things that I asked him,
I,
my podcast a couple of weeks ago,

1044
01:08:38.171 --> 01:08:40.500
I had mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I was a,

1045
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:45.510
I was flying from New York to a back out here to la at the height of the swine

1046
01:08:48.251 --> 01:08:49.570
flu epidemic.

1047
01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.280
<v 2>No,
but that one,
you know,</v>

1048
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:56.840
<v 7>the devastation,
bring out your dead,
you know,
nothing fucking happened.</v>

1049
01:08:56.841 --> 01:09:00.230
But anyways,
I get on the plane or I'm waiting to get on the plane.

1050
01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:02.510
I sit in the terminal and I noticed that,
you know,

1051
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:06.020
there's a couple of hundred people there waiting to get on the plane and 15

1052
01:09:06.021 --> 01:09:11.021
people are wearing those surgical masks and a all 15 were Asian and there was no

1053
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:16.070
nobody else if any race was wearing the mass.
So I was like,
what the fuck?

1054
01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.680
Why are they the only ones wearing mass?

1055
01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:22.490
And somebody actually sent me an interesting observation,

1056
01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:26.090
I don't know if this is true or not,
but they said,
uh,
hey bill,

1057
01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:29.030
you asked about the agents wearing the mass.
I may have an answer.

1058
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:30.650
As a person says,

1059
01:09:30.651 --> 01:09:34.460
I was over in Japan last year and notice that I would see people wearing those

1060
01:09:34.461 --> 01:09:35.780
masks everywhere I went.

1061
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:39.950
So I asked a buddy of mine who lives there and he said that because everyone is

1062
01:09:39.951 --> 01:09:44.951
so jam packed up to their eyeballs and people basically they in close proximity,

1063
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:51.030
uh,
they were there,
they were mess because uh,
they wear them.
Um,

1064
01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.060
what does it say?
I just lost my place.

1065
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.760
They wear them even when they just have a cold.

1066
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.760
I'm assuming it's just a way of life to where the mass,

1067
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.830
when you're sick or something,
hope this helps.

1068
01:10:00.831 --> 01:10:05.280
So I guess over there everybody's so jam packed than I imagined a co,
uh,

1069
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:07.700
the common cold would spread like wildfire.

1070
01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:10.460
So they put those things on,

1071
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:14.360
I guess that kind of makes sense.
What does that mean?

1072
01:10:14.361 --> 01:10:18.560
All 15 of them had had the common cold or they all had the bird flu,

1073
01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.550
<v 2>you know,
I don't fucking know.</v>

1074
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:25.230
<v 7>Or maybe they're more educated evidentaly their technology's better over there</v>

1075
01:10:25.231 --> 01:10:27.000
somehow what happened to America.

1076
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:27.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1077
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.250
<v 7>You know what I mean?
We were the shit,
we still out of this shit.</v>

1078
01:10:32.251 --> 01:10:36.450
We're just a bunch of fucking people now sitting around the cubicles,
you know.

1079
01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:39.420
Do you guys see some of the pictures of the great American cars that I put up

1080
01:10:39.421 --> 01:10:42.930
there?
Just,
you know,
I only put up like three,
I want to put up a bunch more.

1081
01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:47.370
But uh,
that period,
man,
I'm telling you from the 1940s,

1082
01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.070
right through the 60s,
you know,

1083
01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:51.140
<v 2>okay.</v>

1084
01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.890
<v 7>Where it was just the heyday of American cars and the steel industry and all</v>

1085
01:10:54.891 --> 01:10:59.060
that type of shit.
We had a fuck what happened?
You know,

1086
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:03.310
what happened at where we can't,
well we don't make the best cell phone.
We would,

1087
01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:07.450
that should really bother us,
shouldn't it?
What?

1088
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.090
I would just fucking,
I dunno,
it's really bug.
It's really bothering me.

1089
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:14.490
So I dunno.
I'm really don't have anything to say about it.

1090
01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:16.110
But if you listen to these last fucking,

1091
01:11:16.111 --> 01:11:19.380
if you listened to that pathetic attempt at social commentary,

1092
01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:23.130
maybe you understand why we can't make a good cell phone or the best one out

1093
01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:25.710
there.
And uh,
speaking of that,
um,

1094
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.420
let's talk about computer stuff.
You know,
this is the new segment.

1095
01:11:30.421 --> 01:11:33.180
I wish I had a little bit of theme music out there.
You know,

1096
01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:35.490
if somebody could write me some,
uh,
you're going to learn something,

1097
01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.350
theme music and send it as an MP three.

1098
01:11:37.351 --> 01:11:40.890
I'll play it for this part because this is a new segment here where,
um,

1099
01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:46.080
you guys are basically teaching me how not to be a moron with my,
uh,

1100
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.880
with my computer.
And this is something last week,
you know,

1101
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:55.380
I was bitching about how people always send me these emails and the font is

1102
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:57.180
really small and hour.

1103
01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:00.360
I already suck at reading out loud if you haven't noticed yet.

1104
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.290
So I was wishing that people would send it bigger.
So someone goes,

1105
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:07.830
well actually this is what you can do if somebody sends us an email and you

1106
01:12:07.831 --> 01:12:10.440
can't really read it because the fonts too small,

1107
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:15.390
all you have to do is hit the apple command button and the uh,

1108
01:12:15.391 --> 01:12:19.290
the plus side,
like you know,
two plus two and you can make the,

1109
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:24.350
you can make the font get bigger or the apple and the minus sign and you can

1110
01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:27.780
make it gets smaller and it even works on the Internet,
you know,

1111
01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:31.110
for like old people,
you know,
did it,
trying to find tube eight.

1112
01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1113
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:36.290
<v 7>You don't try to find two girls one cup.
And I could,</v>

1114
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.900
she went to show like good food.
So they hit apple fucking plus.

1115
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:45.270
Wow.
How big old people's keyboards.
You ever seen that?

1116
01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:49.440
Like ever see like old people's phones?
You ever seen that?
And like the fucking,

1117
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.240
it's like literally the number pad is as big as like a toddler's hopscotch,

1118
01:12:54.241 --> 01:12:58.590
fucking bored,
you know,
you have a seat,
some shit like that.

1119
01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.630
They just really scares you.
You know,

1120
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:03.990
dying doesn't really scare me because I really have this belief.

1121
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:09.090
Like I really believe in that whole thing that like death is a release and uh,

1122
01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:12.330
I'm looking forward to becoming a fossil fuel.
You know,

1123
01:13:12.331 --> 01:13:16.130
like I don't really need to uh,

1124
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.980
continue this,
you know,
I just,
you know,
I think

1125
01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:22.540
<v 0>okay,</v>

1126
01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.750
<v 7>you know,
live in light living.
If you live a full life,
that's enough.</v>

1127
01:13:25.751 --> 01:13:30.550
That should be enough.
And then I,
then I should just become a,
yeah,

1128
01:13:30.551 --> 01:13:34.990
a fuel.
Can't think of anything.
I don't know.
Moon dust,

1129
01:13:34.991 --> 01:13:36.010
whatever the fuck,
you know,

1130
01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.310
just become part of some shit that other things that are alive.

1131
01:13:39.311 --> 01:13:43.800
Look at what do I got to keep living.
Do you realize the fucking how?
Uh,

1132
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:47.380
Ego maniacal that is

1133
01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:48.830
<v 0>okay</v>

1134
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:53.830
<v 7>to feel that you like God like that you just continue living in this other</v>

1135
01:13:53.901 --> 01:13:56.390
state.
I don't understand that.
It's really,

1136
01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:59.240
it's either that or you just can't wrap your head around.
Not existing,

1137
01:13:59.241 --> 01:14:01.220
which I definitely can't fucking do.

1138
01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.760
But the beauty of not existing as you don't exist,

1139
01:14:04.761 --> 01:14:08.670
so you can't sit there thinking like,
fuck,
I don't exist any more.

1140
01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.270
You just don't exist.
That's it.
You know,
God,

1141
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:14.950
I wish I was deep.
That was pathetic.

1142
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.050
Just skimming the surface of a bunch of cool shit.

1143
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:21.460
And I just have nothing to say because I don't read.
Um,
anyways,

1144
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:23.890
but you ever see that shit?
You ever see some shit where uh,

1145
01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:27.100
it just reminds you of like,
you know,

1146
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.340
I guess maybe to enjoy living.

1147
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:34.210
I was in a hardware store and no,
I wasn't.

1148
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:39.211
I was in cvs and I saw a booster seat for the toilet

1149
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:46.390
and I was just like,
wow.
You know,
like that,
that is an option.

1150
01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:51.780
Like that could possibly happen to me where I could get so fucking old that I

1151
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:59.100
have the ability to lower myself down onto a regulation height,

1152
01:14:59.321 --> 01:15:03.940
toilet seat.
But I lacked the quad strength to get my in my legs,

1153
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:07.930
to get myself back up.
You know?

1154
01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.070
Gee,
I he didn't.
Well,
how do you figure that?
Does that just happen?

1155
01:15:12.071 --> 01:15:16.510
One day you sit down and then you just can't fucking get up again and then you

1156
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:18.910
just have to fucking,
what do you do?

1157
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:22.630
You got to fucking just sort of lean over to one side and fall off the toilet.

1158
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:27.130
Hope there's not a vanity there and then you just lay in there on the tiles.

1159
01:15:27.131 --> 01:15:28.960
You balls is still on the toilet water.

1160
01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:38.100
See what I'm saying?
People,
this is my inspirational speech.
She got to live life.

1161
01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:41.550
You got to live life.
Get a fucking dog.
I'm telling you,

1162
01:15:41.551 --> 01:15:44.370
you're as such shutdown emotional psychopath.

1163
01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.520
I cannot tell you how much having a dog has helped me in fucking two weeks.

1164
01:15:49.831 --> 01:15:50.664
I have in this thing.

1165
01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.990
I absolutely unconditionally fucking love this dog.

1166
01:15:55.950 --> 01:16:00.160
I absolutely fucking love this dog.
And uh,

1167
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.360
I uh,
to the point and take it and you know,

1168
01:16:03.361 --> 01:16:06.750
in the exact thing that I was running from the reason why I never got a dog,

1169
01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.760
like the responsibility of having one and having a walk the fucking thing and

1170
01:16:11.761 --> 01:16:16.440
give it water.
And if it takes a shit,
I got to pick it up in a fritos bag,

1171
01:16:16.441 --> 01:16:21.330
you know,
and act like I'm walking to my trash barrel when I'm really going to my

1172
01:16:21.331 --> 01:16:24.870
neighbors,
you know,
going through all that bullshit.

1173
01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.210
That's the thing I think I loved the most.

1174
01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:32.630
I actually like that I have a reason to walk away from having fucking four

1175
01:16:33.451 --> 01:16:38.220
Scotches,
you know?
Now I only have three,
you know,

1176
01:16:38.221 --> 01:16:41.820
and then I come home half in the bag and I started screaming at the dog about my

1177
01:16:41.821 --> 01:16:46.270
childhood.
You know,
it's a great thing.
I don't see,

1178
01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:51.300
I don't scream at him like it's his fault.
I just yell at it about my childhood,

1179
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.510
you know?
No,
I don't do that shit.

1180
01:16:54.511 --> 01:16:56.790
I just like getting you animal lovers up in a fucking,

1181
01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:58.670
get your panties in a bunch.

1182
01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:04.410
<v 2>Do you really do?
It's just a job.
It doesn't understand.</v>

1183
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:08.970
<v 7>Oh
no,
but it's,
it's,
it's been,</v>

1184
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:11.150
it's been a great thing to the point.
I'm literally,

1185
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.450
I took it to the beach today and uh,

1186
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:16.550
it's fucking hilarious.

1187
01:17:16.551 --> 01:17:20.990
Took it down to the water and this thing is so god damn like muscular.

1188
01:17:20.991 --> 01:17:22.040
It's ridiculous.

1189
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:25.160
Like you remember those that you don't really ever see pumping iron.

1190
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.970
Did you ever see that when those guys that you know that that dead fucking the

1191
01:17:28.971 --> 01:17:32.660
hulk Hogan Flex where they,
I don't know how to do it.

1192
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.370
How the fuck to you without visually all right,
you bring it up,

1193
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.290
right?
Like in the wrestler,
bring it up.

1194
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:42.890
Remember that show off the v and then you bring it back down and you got your

1195
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:47.690
two fists meeting right above your fucking pubes that shot.
Right.

1196
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.520
You know,
fucking all the muscles papa.

1197
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.800
That's what this fucking dog looks like when it's running.

1198
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:56.360
And it was absolutely terrified of the water and the ocean.
You know,

1199
01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:00.860
like I was trying to get it to go out where it was just above its neck,
you know,

1200
01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.710
you know where it's paws weren't touching the ground.

1201
01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.170
The tide was really strong and shit.
So it was kind of,

1202
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.170
but we kind of offsetting each other like counterbalance and each other with

1203
01:18:09.171 --> 01:18:11.450
like the weight of the dog and me.
You know,

1204
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:14.960
a couple of times like the waves like washing over and he's doing like

1205
01:18:14.961 --> 01:18:18.460
somersaults and shit and uh,
the thing got so far

1206
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:22.190
<v 9>fucking scared.
I'm looking at it like,
dude,
you're a pit bull.
This is pathetic.</v>

1207
01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:25.190
We're in Venice beach.
People are watching,
you know,

1208
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:30.070
you know what's funny is people who are really into animals actually just

1209
01:18:30.071 --> 01:18:32.320
believe that fucking story.
They actually,

1210
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:37.420
I went out into the ocean with the fucking dog.
I've,

1211
01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.810
I'm terrified of the fucking ocean.
Don't you guys listen to my act?

1212
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:43.660
How much you seen any of my past specials?

1213
01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:47.020
I am absolutely fucking terrified of the ocean.

1214
01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:51.550
I will not go in it younger way.
I'll go in and if my boat sinks,

1215
01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:56.470
okay or if I'm on fire.
And even then,
even then,
even then,

1216
01:18:56.471 --> 01:18:57.520
then what the fuck is that?

1217
01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.510
Even then I'll just stay in the shadow of shallow water.
Can't fucking talk.

1218
01:19:01.511 --> 01:19:05.680
All of a sudden
I used to do a bit in my act,
right?

1219
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:09.640
Uh,
I love how I just throw these jokes out cause I'm never going to put them on

1220
01:19:09.641 --> 01:19:10.840
albums or anything like that.

1221
01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:13.870
I used to do this bit in my act where I was talking about being terrified of the

1222
01:19:13.871 --> 01:19:17.020
ocean.
You know,
cause I'm scared of sharks stare.

1223
01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.290
I'm scared of getting eaten alive and drowning at the same time,
you know,

1224
01:19:20.291 --> 01:19:24.040
combining,
you know,
like split and aces in a bad way,

1225
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:28.900
like horrific deaths,
you know.
So this guy one time,
this is the joke,
right?

1226
01:19:28.901 --> 01:19:32.680
He used to,
he,
this guy says to me,
trying to make me more relaxed.
Wait a minute,

1227
01:19:32.681 --> 01:19:36.860
is my phone ringing?
Sorry.
Breaking my balls at the Celtics last.
Oh,

1228
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.450
since Joe to Rosa.
He doesn't give a shit.
He doesn't,
you guys want to hear?
Oh,

1229
01:19:40.451 --> 01:19:43.540
I got my first phone and call Joe to Rosa.
Hang on a second.

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:37.583
hang on,

1264
01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:39.213
<v 3>hang on.</v>

1265
01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:43.650
<v 9>Oh,
I was a little one.
That was a little one.
Okay.
How about that?
A phone in,</v>

1266
01:21:43.651 --> 01:21:46.620
in a fucking earthquake and a fucking MP.

1267
01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:50.880
Three at the beginning is this is the best God damn podcast ever.
Jesus Christ.

1268
01:21:50.881 --> 01:21:51.714
Is that scary?

1269
01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:53.843
<v 3>Huh?</v>

1270
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:56.040
<v 9>So for,
you know what you do when the earthquake,
you just,</v>

1271
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:58.500
you just sort of stand there and you put your fucking hands out.

1272
01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:03.420
Like you could somehow stop the energy.
You know,
like all of a sudden you're a,

1273
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:08.130
I dunno,
some superhero,
they knows how to stop the fuck.
That's what I did.
I said,

1274
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:11.460
okay.
Okay.
Normally I would actually run into the door jamb.

1275
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:16.770
Wait a fucking minute.
Wait a minute.
I got a dog.

1276
01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.460
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1277
01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.293
<v 9>Hey cleo.</v>

1278
01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:21.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1279
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:24.350
<v 9>Aren't you supposed to give me a warning about that shit?</v>

1280
01:22:24.351 --> 01:22:26.300
I thought you fucking dogs knew stuff about that.

1281
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:32.080
We just just proved them fucking meth right there.
Hang on a second.

1282
01:22:32.081 --> 01:22:34.120
I got to make sure my dogs are right.
Hold on,
hold on,
hold on.

1283
01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.750
<v 3>Cool.
Yeah.
Okay.
Ready?</v>

1284
01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.240
<v 9>Alright.
Get shown.
All right.</v>

1285
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:46.740
The dog's dog show is probably just a truck driving by.
I'm such a fan.

1286
01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.280
All right.
Anyways,
let's get back to as,
wow,
this is really okay.

1287
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:52.920
You know what's funny?
Look at me working on my memory.

1288
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:56.370
Thank you everybody for all your tips out there that I can't remember what the

1289
01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:59.160
fuck they were and I haven't even used them.
I'm lying,
but I'm going to use them.

1290
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:01.860
I'm going to use them.
What does it Pictionary?

1291
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.170
What the fuck am I supposed to use?
Um,
I'm actually,

1292
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:05.560
I actually remember what I was talking about.

1293
01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:07.603
<v 11>MMM.</v>

1294
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.040
<v 9>The fuck fuckers I know.
Oh yeah,
that's right.
I was still doing one.
Uh,
one of my,</v>

1295
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:13.170
one of my jokes I used to do,
but seven,
eight years ago,

1296
01:23:13.171 --> 01:23:14.430
if you saw me down the comedy cellar,

1297
01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.120
you might recognize this one goes a little something like this.
Uh,

1298
01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.900
what was I talking?
Oh yeah,

1299
01:23:21.901 --> 01:23:24.990
this how this guy was trying to get me to not be freaked out about going into

1300
01:23:24.991 --> 01:23:29.820
the ocean and sharks.
And he goes,
uh,
he goes,
well,

1301
01:23:29.821 --> 01:23:32.040
you know some bill,
a lot of people don't realize this,

1302
01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:37.041
but out 90% of shark attacks actually happened in the shallow water.

1303
01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:41.430
And My punchline was like,
yeah,
that's where the people are.

1304
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:45.660
It's called the beach.
Stupid.
Right?
Stupid little attitude.

1305
01:23:45.661 --> 01:23:48.180
I wore a leather jacket.
I was dangerous back then.

1306
01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.390
What the fuck was the tat tagged to that?

1307
01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:55.600
I literally have to go back to the beginning to remember.
Yeah.

1308
01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:58.540
It's where the people are.
It's called the beach.
Stupid.
You know,

1309
01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.010
it's like to some guy goes,
yeah,
let's do you know,
I used to mind swimming.

1310
01:24:03.011 --> 01:24:06.910
Let's go out.
Let's go to Europe.
You fucking pussies.
That was the joke.
Oh,

1311
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:08.740
and the people,
they would laugh,

1312
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.800
they would laugh and I would get myself a free falafel.

1313
01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:15.520
That's what I would do when I worked at the comedy cellar.
You do food spots,

1314
01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:20.410
food spots back in the day,
which meant you literally were working for food.

1315
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:22.420
That's how much fun my fucking job is.

1316
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:27.570
I used to drive from Boston all the way down to New York City and I used to sign

1317
01:24:29.141 --> 01:24:33.070
up for the late night at the comedy cellar.
Uh,

1318
01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.370
and late night was at uh,

1319
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:40.030
between one and two in the morning or two 30 in the morning and back then you

1320
01:24:40.031 --> 01:24:44.290
would simply sign up $9.
A lot of young comics right now I think in that,

1321
01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:47.590
that was really easy and they're actually right because now they make them

1322
01:24:47.591 --> 01:24:48.424
fucking,

1323
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:52.540
they got to do pre shows and they got to bring 20 fucking people and blow

1324
01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:53.620
somebody.
It's,
it's,

1325
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:58.750
they got a bark outside standing with flyers as brutal back back in the day,

1326
01:24:58.751 --> 01:25:00.160
you'd just go down and you'd sign up.

1327
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:02.230
But I would drive three and a half hours down,

1328
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.740
sign up three and a half hours back.
I knew I had to do that one too.

1329
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:10.360
That was how fucking dumb I was.
This is my big way that I was going to get in,

1330
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:14.560
in like at [inaudible] in New York or whatever.
Just my whole way,

1331
01:25:14.561 --> 01:25:16.930
like I had to take baby steps when I went to New York because I was so

1332
01:25:16.931 --> 01:25:20.980
intimidated when I went down to New York because all I had performed two was a

1333
01:25:20.981 --> 01:25:25.390
bunch of angry white dudes in Boston and I wasn't angry white dude.

1334
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:29.200
I fucking grew up around angry white dude.
So it was,
no,
it wasn't a problem.

1335
01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.170
Then when I went down in New York,
everybody's there.
There was,

1336
01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:37.000
he don't Puerto Ricans,
black people,
fucking Puerto Ricans.
Alright,

1337
01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:39.370
blanked out whatever.
There's a bunch of other people there,
right?

1338
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:42.760
Oh wait a second.
I saw a do rag.
I'd get like,
I'd feel myself.
I literally just,

1339
01:25:42.761 --> 01:25:47.650
I get back on my heels and then there's nothing worse.
Bobbing sucks.

1340
01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.160
But when you bomb because you,
you were a fucking pussy.

1341
01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.720
That's the worst kind of bombing.

1342
01:25:52.721 --> 01:25:56.890
If you stand there right in your fucking given it right back to them and they're

1343
01:25:56.891 --> 01:25:58.990
just giving you shit and you'll lose.

1344
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.320
But at least you told him to go fuck themselves.
There's this something,

1345
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:05.930
it's still sucks.
I'm not going to lie.
It's still like a nice fucking liver shot.

1346
01:26:05.931 --> 01:26:10.250
But I'm telling you,
it's,
it's,
it hurts so much more when you're,

1347
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:16.700
when you act like ned Beatty.
All right.
Anyways,
um,
what am I doing?

1348
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:20.380
What am I doing here?
Well,
let's,
let's,
how far into this podcast out we can,

1349
01:26:20.381 --> 01:26:25.280
we had phone calls.
We've had fucking earthquakes.
I talked to my dog.
All right.

1350
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:29.600
With 39 minutes in,
um,
oh,
coming up this week.
Let's,
let's for once,

1351
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:33.530
let me hype.
Uh,
let me hyper.
What the fuck I got going on?

1352
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:37.010
I'm going to be at the Improv out here in a Hollywood,
California.

1353
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.830
I know a lot of people out,
uh,
out West are always asking me,

1354
01:26:39.831 --> 01:26:43.580
when are you going to be forming in la?
Well,
there you go.
Your sons a bitches.

1355
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:48.580
I'm going to be at the,
uh,
the Improv on Melrose.
Uh,

1356
01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:53.020
uh,
uh,
May 22nd and May 23rd.
That's a Friday and a Saturday.

1357
01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:58.320
Fridays at eight o'clock and Saturday two shows seven 30 and nine 30.

1358
01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:02.550
And I'm be breaking on a bunch of new material and we talking about my dog and

1359
01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:07.090
what a fucking moron I am.
I don't know what I'm going to say.
Let them emerging.

1360
01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.890
It's going to be hilarious.
Least I'm hoping it is.
And uh,

1361
01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:16.700
maybe that's what I'll do.
Maybe I'll just become that guy who fucking,
uh,

1362
01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:20.250
that's all right.
You know,
that's going to be a next career move.

1363
01:27:20.251 --> 01:27:24.210
I'm just gonna just talk about dogs and be that guy.
You know the dog guy,

1364
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:28.020
he just talks about dogs.
Oh yes.
I saw that guy.

1365
01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:33.240
That's the best,
the quickest way to blow up.
You know,

1366
01:27:33.241 --> 01:27:36.990
I saw the other day that there was a,
uh,
you know,
and I,
I don't,

1367
01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:41.700
I don't begrudge anybody who sells tickets here.
Let me preface it with that.

1368
01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.760
But I saw that there was a ventriloquist who was booked to play in like this

1369
01:27:47.911 --> 01:27:48.960
basketball arena,

1370
01:27:48.961 --> 01:27:52.310
like a professional basketball or mean like where the fucking Atlanta Hawks play

1371
01:27:52.311 --> 01:27:56.550
or some shit.
All right.
And God bless that guy.

1372
01:27:56.610 --> 01:28:01.020
He deserves every fucking dime he gets.
But this is the question I have for you.

1373
01:28:01.021 --> 01:28:06.021
What kind of a fucking moron sits in the upper deck of a Goddamn arena to watch

1374
01:28:08.851 --> 01:28:13.490
your fucking ventriloquist
in a salmon?
I'm saying.
I mean,
what?
What,

1375
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:16.920
what do you say on the car ride home?
You couldn't get it.
I couldn't even,

1376
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.620
I couldn't even see his lips move.
Yeah.
Even when he was talking,

1377
01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:24.770
you couldn't see it.
You're dumb cunt.
You fucking 20 rows away.

1378
01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:26.400
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1379
01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.420
<v 9>It was,
I didn't vote.
I was amazed in the way he could throw his voice.</v>

1380
01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:35.430
It was almost like they had invented some sort of apparatus that amplified what

1381
01:28:35.431 --> 01:28:40.380
he was saying because it was so loud and it was so far away and yet I couldn't

1382
01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:44.610
see his lips moving.
Can you imagine being that dumb?
How much fun you have?

1383
01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:47.400
Like how good does ice cream taste when you're that fucking stupid?

1384
01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.750
You could have vanilla ice cream and enjoy a bowl of that.

1385
01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:56.220
Just having the time of your life too dumb to stop eating it.

1386
01:28:56.221 --> 01:28:59.460
Just wondering why you keep getting headaches.
Oh,
great.

1387
01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.260
Another untimely headache.

1388
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:03.780
Just when I was going to enjoy the rest of this ice cream.

1389
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:08.990
Why do these untimely headaches always have to come when I'm enjoying what I

1390
01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:12.450
love to do.
Most eating a whole bowl of vanilla ice cream

1391
01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.620
dot.
That would be great just to be there.
Fucking stupid,
you know,
you know,

1392
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.660
it's stupid.
I've talked about this before.
You know,
that stupid way.

1393
01:29:20.661 --> 01:29:22.980
Your fucking mouth is open.
Even when you're not talking.

1394
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.960
You know those people and just sit there and for some reason their tongue never

1395
01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:32.160
dries out.
Even a bulldog,
that tip of its tongue will dry out after a while,

1396
01:29:32.161 --> 01:29:36.360
but morons that,
I don't know what it is,
that tongue never did,
never dries out.

1397
01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.050
So you've got to just sit there and look at it.
You know,
it's annoying.

1398
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:42.720
If it was dried out,
it at least make you feel good that there was suffering.

1399
01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:47.250
All right,
that was a tangent.
Um,
let's get back to the podcast here.

1400
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.750
Um,
all right.
There was actually some great questions here.

1401
01:29:51.751 --> 01:29:55.410
This is why I actually saved these.
Um,
this is a great,

1402
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:57.830
if you guys want to have a,
uh,

1403
01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.970
if you want to have a blueprint for a great question.
I am actually,
you know,

1404
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.470
I got to tell you,
you guys have really stepped up and general,

1405
01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.990
I'm going to give you all a pat on the back.
You guys are really,

1406
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:10.320
you're writing really funny shit in there.
They're great questions.

1407
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.800
Like this one here.
Listen to this question,
Bill.

1408
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:15.660
If you were a serial killer,

1409
01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:20.490
how would you kill your victims and what would be your serial killer name?
Uh,

1410
01:30:20.491 --> 01:30:23.520
for my job,
I have a lot of time to think about stuff.

1411
01:30:23.521 --> 01:30:28.320
And I was listening to your story about the Green River killer and it got me to

1412
01:30:28.321 --> 01:30:30.930
thinking if I was a serial killer,
how would I do it?

1413
01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:33.260
He's alluding to my podcast a couple of weeks ago.

1414
01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.060
I was talking about how they always give like serial killers nicknames,

1415
01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:41.340
like they're playing in the fucking Rose Bowl,
you know?
Uh,
so anyways,
so,

1416
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:45.420
so he actually action.
And you know what,
that's what I did last week.

1417
01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.500
That's what the fuck I did.
I looked up a bunch of serial killer nicknames.

1418
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:50.521
You know,

1419
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:55.521
I noticed a lot of guys had a great nicknames,

1420
01:30:55.591 --> 01:30:58.890
but there was actually a surprising amount of female serial killers,

1421
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:04.020
but not enough of them got cool nicknames except for this one lady who was known

1422
01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:08.850
as the giggling grandmother and a,
I can't remember it was a couple of weeks ago,

1423
01:31:08.851 --> 01:31:12.960
but she literally killed like four husbands,
both her sisters,

1424
01:31:12.961 --> 01:31:16.380
a second cousin or whatever.
And they finally,
you know,

1425
01:31:16.381 --> 01:31:18.270
figured out what the fuck was going on.

1426
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:21.120
The amount of Shit you could get away with back in the day,
you know,

1427
01:31:21.121 --> 01:31:24.960
nowadays you got to kill like 22 complete strangers back in the day before they

1428
01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:28.530
knew how to dust for fingerprints and they didn't have all this fucking DNA

1429
01:31:28.531 --> 01:31:32.970
investigation.
You could literally kill everybody at work.
You know,

1430
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.760
you work with 40 people in 40 weekends in a row,

1431
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.090
somebody could be disappearing and you could literally just keep shrugging your

1432
01:31:39.091 --> 01:31:43.560
shoulders going,
ah,
I don't know either.
I mean,
yeah,
what are the odds?

1433
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:47.310
Um,
so anyways,

1434
01:31:47.311 --> 01:31:52.200
when they finally picked up this old lady and they interrogated her,

1435
01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:56.100
I guess she would just laugh when they were,
did you kill him?

1436
01:31:56.101 --> 01:31:58.680
And she would just sort of laugh and say,
yeah,
I did.

1437
01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:03.280
And they tell if she was just trying to mask her embarrassment or if she was

1438
01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:05.830
just that shut down or whatever.
But she got the nickname,

1439
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:09.550
the giggling grandmother.
That's a great one.
That's a great one.

1440
01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.670
The giggling grandma literations grandmother,

1441
01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:15.070
she supposed to be making cookies and she's out killing people.

1442
01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:18.340
Gives you a chill.
It's fucking beautiful.
So anyways,
let's get back to this.

1443
01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:22.930
So this guy says he feats sat around thinking about it at work and a okay,

1444
01:32:22.931 --> 01:32:26.320
here's his deal.
He said,
not to sound too crazy,
but I did give it to some give,

1445
01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:29.410
did give it some thought as how I would kill somebody.
He said,

1446
01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.440
I figured I would use a stick I found in the forest and sharpen it,

1447
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:40.090
use it and then burn the evidence.
I would be the caveman killer.
Dude.

1448
01:32:40.091 --> 01:32:42.880
I got to tell you,
that's just fucking great.
That's just really well thought out.

1449
01:32:42.881 --> 01:32:46.660
How fucking awesome is that all these guys for years in the mob,
you know,

1450
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:50.770
they tape up the gun with duct tape and then they shoot the dude and then they

1451
01:32:50.771 --> 01:32:54.340
throw it in the fucking river and then some fucking nerd who never gets any

1452
01:32:54.341 --> 01:32:57.790
pussy.
Who's got time to use a metal detector at the bottom of the river,

1453
01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:00.340
finds the fucking thing.
And next thing you know,

1454
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:03.940
you get busted at your third year fucking high school graduation,
right?

1455
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:08.380
It happens all the time.
This is perfect.
It's perfect.
If you kill somebody,

1456
01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:10.990
you don't even know what the sharpened stick.
You burn the fucking stick.

1457
01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.680
This is so good.
I don't even want to fucking,
I don't even want to like,
like,

1458
01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:18.070
like talk about it.
I'm afraid I'm giving somebody a great idea.

1459
01:33:18.071 --> 01:33:22.810
So let's get to me.
How would I do it and what my serial killer name would be?
Um,

1460
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:27.640
well if you know me,
um,
I'm a big fan of yesteryear.

1461
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:32.350
I'm not looking forward to the future.
So I would go old school,
you know,

1462
01:33:32.351 --> 01:33:35.890
I would go old school.
I try to bring back the sickle,
you know,

1463
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:39.520
I would use is sickle and uh,

1464
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:44.320
and I would definitely get into the placement of the body.
Okay.

1465
01:33:44.321 --> 01:33:49.321
Well just be me because I learned from a cop that the more people you involve in

1466
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:50.140
a crime,

1467
01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:53.440
the higher chance you have of getting caught because somebody is going to be

1468
01:33:53.441 --> 01:33:57.150
that fucking moron.
Like that kid.
I mean that fucking kid in,
uh,

1469
01:33:57.610 --> 01:34:00.820
was it Saturday night fever when he doesn't jump in on the fight?

1470
01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.290
Where will you guys,
oh,
I was looking for you.
There's always one of those guys,

1471
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:06.333
you know,

1472
01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.010
they just start crying and I was with this guy bill,

1473
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:16.720
he's fucking work in the fucking Improv next weekend.
Um,

1474
01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:19.590
so I would definitely do it alone and I would bring back the sickle.

1475
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:23.470
I would wear the hood and I would do all that type and I wouldn't wear the hood.

1476
01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:25.240
It just make me all sweaty.
I'm going to kill him.

1477
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:26.530
Who cares what they see my face.

1478
01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.860
And basically what I would do is I would just fucking chop their heads off and I

1479
01:34:33.311 --> 01:34:38.311
would leave the head in their bed and I'd leave their body in the bathtub and I

1480
01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:43.420
would be known as the,
uh,
bed bath and be header

1481
01:34:48.190 --> 01:34:50.080
and I can,
I just apologize for that.

1482
01:34:50.110 --> 01:34:55.060
I really knew that that was going to stink as though as I was starting to say
it,

1483
01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:58.910
I knew that that was going to be awful.
But I dunno,
I was just,

1484
01:34:58.911 --> 01:35:00.080
I was trying to fucking,

1485
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.280
I hate corporations and if there was just a way that you could go around killing

1486
01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:09.281
people and to have it kind of sound like best buy or bed bath and beyond just so

1487
01:35:09.591 --> 01:35:14.591
some fucking douchebag would have to actually stand behind a podium and actually

1488
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:19.340
read some letter of detraction going,
we don't condone,

1489
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.050
we here at bed,
bath and beyond,

1490
01:35:21.051 --> 01:35:25.880
do not condone what the bed bath and be header does.
We don't condone,

1491
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:30.620
um,
even just the Celtic people,
once again,
we are bed bath and beyond.

1492
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.810
We,
there's no beheading that happens here.
And,
um,

1493
01:35:35.811 --> 01:35:37.220
I know he's still on the loose,

1494
01:35:37.221 --> 01:35:42.221
but I think it's safe to say that he does not work for us and we are cooperating

1495
01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:44.030
with the local authorities,

1496
01:35:44.031 --> 01:35:48.140
have answered all their questions and that's all we have to say on the matter.

1497
01:35:48.141 --> 01:35:51.800
And we would just like to get back to selling pillowcases,
you know,

1498
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:56.030
just to make them fucking do that.
Eric Diego,
this is a podcast for the week.

<v 7>Lot of thrills,
lot of spills are the alert quake.
Little,
a little,</v>

1501
01:36:01.051 --> 01:36:01.980
a little bit of everything.

1502
01:36:01.981 --> 01:36:05.460
I hope I was able to edit that MP three in the front of this because I recorded

1503
01:36:05.461 --> 01:36:06.570
this fucking thing first.

1504
01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:11.150
<v 9>You know,
so,
uh,
that's it.
Please come out and see me at the,
uh,</v>

1505
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:15.510
the Improv this week and I'm trying to put together none that another Ra Monday

1506
01:36:15.511 --> 01:36:18.210
show up at the punchline in San Francisco.

1507
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:22.530
I had so much fun last March doing that.
And uh,
that's what I got going on.

1508
01:36:22.531 --> 01:36:26.760
And uh,
congratulations to the people down there in Orlando.
Uh,

1509
01:36:26.761 --> 01:36:29.040
you got a great basketball team,
you'd beat my Celtics.

1510
01:36:29.041 --> 01:36:30.480
Congratulations to you guys.

1511
01:36:30.481 --> 01:36:33.660
You know you've got something better to do then fucking put steel balls

1512
01:36:33.930 --> 01:36:37.740
underneath your fucking pickup truck and drive over to Epcot center,
you know,

1513
01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:42.660
or have a wild weekend down there in Tampa.
Huh?
You know,

1514
01:36:42.661 --> 01:36:45.930
or just sit around watching your mullets grow.
You know,
you got,

1515
01:36:45.931 --> 01:36:49.680
you go into the fucking eastern conference finals.
Who Do you guys like?

1516
01:36:49.681 --> 01:36:51.420
Who Do you like?
I got to tell you,

1517
01:36:51.421 --> 01:36:56.421
I'm rooting for the fucking nuggets and I'm living out here in la.

1518
01:36:56.670 --> 01:36:59.790
I really,
I really,
you know,
I don't hate,

1519
01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:02.010
I don't hate Laker fans cause it's like they live here,

1520
01:37:02.011 --> 01:37:03.840
so obviously they're fucking in the Lakers.

1521
01:37:03.841 --> 01:37:06.870
But what I do hate is how they're acting like they're anywhere near the amount

1522
01:37:06.871 --> 01:37:10.170
of championships at the Celtics have.
It's like,
dude,
you have nine.

1523
01:37:10.530 --> 01:37:15.270
The Los Angeles Lakers have nine championships.
Okay,
stop with this.

1524
01:37:15.271 --> 01:37:20.040
14 the Minneapolis Lakers one five.
Okay.
Your,
your,

1525
01:37:20.041 --> 01:37:23.820
your,
your franchise has one 14 I'll give you that.

1526
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.590
If you take two cities and you glue them together,
they have won,

1527
01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.900
you've won three less championships,
then the one city of Boston has won.

1528
01:37:33.901 --> 01:37:36.330
Don't have a fucking,
forget that.
All right.

1529
01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:40.170
Because if the Lakers ever moved to fucking Las Vegas and they won a

1530
01:37:40.171 --> 01:37:44.280
championship,
how would you think of some Douche bag?
And Vegas was like,
yeah,

1531
01:37:44.281 --> 01:37:48.920
we got 15 bitches.
It's like,
no you don't.
No.

1532
01:37:48.921 --> 01:37:51.720
You know you got one,
you got one.
All right.
See you fuckers.

1533
01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:54.210
You're still in single digits and you're going to lose to the nuggets.

1534
01:37:54.610 --> 01:37:57.420
At least I hope you do.
I hope you don't show up.
Hope.
You know.

1535
01:37:57.421 --> 01:38:02.070
I don't know why the Lakers aren't showing up.
This is easy for them.
Kevin,

1536
01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:05.550
Garnett,
south,
Bam.
It's wide open.
You're good to go.

1537
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:09.630
The Cavaliers do not have enough guys on their team to beat you guys.

1538
01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.300
The nuggets don't have enough guys.
But you know what?

1539
01:38:12.301 --> 01:38:15.360
The nuggets and the Cavaliers have that the Lakers don't have.
They have heart.

1540
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:18.780
They got fucking heart.
I'm telling you,
the lady who the fuck takes,

1541
01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:22.050
who takes games off in the playoffs?
Who does that?
You know,

1542
01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:26.940
does that the fucking Los Angeles Lakers.
It's almost like this.
So fucking good.

1543
01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:31.960
They just stay.
Ah,
let's fuck around.
I Dunno.
I don't fuck it.

1544
01:38:31.961 --> 01:38:34.800
No,
I'm just,
you know,
I don't know.
I'm bummed my team lost.

1545
01:38:34.801 --> 01:38:35.634
But you know something.

1546
01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.580
The can somebody in the NBA just called traveling?
I don't give a fuck.

1547
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:44.000
Even if it's on my own.
I,
so I so fucking,
oh,

1548
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:49.450
what's his face there tonight?
Fuck.
Am I trying to think.
I'm already thinking.

1549
01:38:49.451 --> 01:38:54.340
I,
they just suck with names.
Just pause,
Bill.

1550
01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.820
Think that Ray Lewis,
he plays for the fucking,

1551
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:59.230
<v 12>yeah.</v>

1552
01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:01.420
<v 9>Ray Allen.
Jesus Christ.
I'm getting old here.</v>

1553
01:39:01.421 --> 01:39:05.890
I went and seen how ray Allen literally catches a ball.
He runs three steps,

1554
01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.550
clearly runs three steps,
and it takes a three pointer and hits it.

1555
01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.510
The Mana Times.

1556
01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:15.511
I just sit there and scream traveling as I watch an NBA game is that it's

1557
01:39:15.821 --> 01:39:18.670
ridiculous.
He know.
Ridiculous as I continue this podcast,

1558
01:39:18.671 --> 01:39:22.150
even though it was over.
It's over.
All right.
You guys get on with your lives,

1559
01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:27.340
your lives,
your lives.
What a fucking moron.
Alright,

1560
01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:29.250
you guys have a good week.
God bless.

1561
01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:42.043
<v 12>Mm.</v>

1562
01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.600
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1563
