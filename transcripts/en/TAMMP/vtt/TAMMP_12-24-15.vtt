00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.580
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and it's time for the,

2
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:07.414
what do you got there?

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.020
I was trying to scare you by putting this dry eye isn't having this Smoko

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.440
what happened?
It didn't work.
Ah,

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.330
they had just tried to put dry ice in the room.

6
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:22.150
What's going on is bill Barnes time for the Thursday afternoon,

7
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:25.270
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.970
<v 2>Oh,
just checking in on you and</v>

9
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.480
<v 1>Christmas.
What's going on?
Merry Christmas.</v>

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.040
Merry Christmas to you and to every one,

11
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:43.990
you know,
um,
I am in a fucking great damn move.

12
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:48.940
I'll tell you why because all my rose bowl tickets showed up and it was funny,

13
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:52.420
I was laying them out.
I do it every year for all the fellas.

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.870
I take a picture of them when they're all there and I just send them the
picture.

15
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:59.230
And as I was laying it out,
we got to eight people go in this year.

16
00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:02.260
I was laying them out and just subconsciously,

17
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.330
I don't know if it's because of all the promotion,

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.790
I was laying them out and I was just going,

19
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.740
<v 0>Bah,
Bah,
Bah Blah Blah,</v>

20
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.490
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.850
<v 1>And he starts laughing,
going to,
is this your star wars?
And I was like,</v>

22
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.610
you know what it is.
I think it is

23
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.240
<v 0>woo.</v>

24
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.940
<v 1>Um,
another rose bowl is coming around.
It's coming around.
Hey,
you know,</v>

25
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:30.530
I might even go see star wars.
I've been such a cunt about it.

26
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.520
Everybody tells me it's a good movie.
Granted,
I think it's,
you know,

27
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.410
compared to the others,
you know what I mean?

28
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.370
Like you ever see an actor who just sucks his whole career and then he finally

29
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:42.460
gets a decent thing,
a decent fucking part,

30
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.080
and he's actually above average.
He always gets nominated for an award.

31
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.770
That's the,
uh,
the Holy Shit.
Um,
for one,

32
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:55.900
she didn't suck Oscar nomination.
You know,
I'm not going to name names,

33
00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:59.610
but you know what happens,
you know what I mean?
That whole fucking career there.

34
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.160
I don't know what they're doing.
Dead deer fucking,
uh,

35
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.220
they're always play this way.
They're always playing a cowboy.
You know,

36
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:08.200
the whole fucking time.
They're always playing a cow

37
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.060
<v 2>boy.
Yeah,
I'll get those engines out of here.
What power?
White power.
Right?</v>

38
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.590
<v 1>Doing all the car.
They always lived the white power part up.
But you know,</v>

39
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.300
howdy ma'am.

40
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.970
They do all that shit and they want a gun fight and that's all you see him

41
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:21.950
fucking do it.
And then all of a sudden out of nowhere,

42
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:25.310
they play a postman who they're like,
oh my God,
he was so believable.

43
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.290
I mean,
the hotel by just,
I thought I could never see him as a cowboy.

44
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.410
And then there he wants

45
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.560
the little chain that led to his keys that opened stuff up for the mail.
I,

46
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.640
I mean,
I bought it.
I was in,
he's really good,
you know,

47
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.350
or the in shape.
Good looking guy gains a little bit of weight,
you know,

48
00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:52.030
or the hot chick does it wear any makeup.
And they go,
it's so brave.
So brave.

49
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:56.560
We have to give her something shiny.
Um,
so anyways,

50
00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:57.760
people are telling me as good,

51
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.780
so I got to get all this shit out about that entire fucking thing.

52
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.430
I don't even know why I care.
I don't think I care.

53
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.840
I think I just like being a cunt.

54
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.840
I think I like when I see a group of human beings excited,

55
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.690
I like to throw a little rain on it,
you know,

56
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.390
I don't know what that says about me.
Probably says it deep down inside.

57
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.960
Maybe I'm not the happiest person.
And when I see joy and others,

58
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.760
it reminds me of my own sadness

59
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.130
or those movies are a little overrated.

60
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.160
Uh,
Geez.
Belt.
Can you let it go?
Sorry.
I'm also,
I'm very excited because,

61
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.170
um,
after it's for family,
uh,
I've got nothing but a wonderful,

62
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.490
um,
tweets from everybody.
It's stuff on Facebook.
It's been,

63
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.760
everything's been positive except two people.
One guy was just like,
oh,
okay,

64
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.770
kid paternally to is going to be as funny as you stand up back.
So whatever.

65
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.390
Um,
which was kind of a compliment as he,
uh,
you know,

66
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.570
took the nonexistent DVD of my new series and it's just slap me in the face with

67
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:59.140
it.
So it was weird.
It was,
it was an abusive relationship.

68
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.120
So obviously I'm attracted to him now.
Um,

69
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.310
I'm sorry.
And then what else did I get?
I got another one.
Um,

70
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.570
oh fuck.
It was funny as hell too,
and the guy was legitimately

71
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.180
not enjoying the series.
Ah,
fuck.
I can't remember.

72
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.210
It's still my favorite one of all was when we just showed the pictures of the

73
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.550
characters with a little bit of music and no dialogue.

74
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:27.550
And that guy wrote and the shark has been jumped.

75
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.730
That's all he needed to see.
Oh,
I needed to say.

76
00:04:31.731 --> 00:04:35.080
It was just pictures of the characters.
He didn't need any dialogue.

77
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.130
He didn't need the story.
All he needed was those pictures.
A little song.

78
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.480
And 23 years of me being in this business,
we're just flushed down the toilet.

79
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.510
I hope the person who sent me that tweet is listening to this because I want you

80
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.680
to know,
we,
uh,
got together all the writers to,
to uh,

81
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.860
get ourselves a little headstart if we get a second season.

82
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.010
And I mentioned that to all the writers and we were all dying laughing.

83
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.060
We thought it was,
it was,
you know,
obviously you don't like getting shit on,

84
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:03.220
but some of them are so ridiculous that it's funny.

85
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:07.240
So now that's become a running a running joke in the writer's room now,

86
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.800
and the shark has been chomped.
So anyways,
um,

87
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.000
but of course a Netflix doesn't give out rating.

88
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.110
So technically I don't know how it's performing,
but I do,
you know what I mean?

89
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.370
If it sucked,
I would have been getting a bunch of,
uh,
Jesus.
Oh,
Jesus.
Hey,

90
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:25.490
at least you're standups.
Okay.
Um,
all right.

91
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.340
And with that,
let's talk a bull games.

92
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:31.870
Six 58 fucking bowl games today.
Uh,

93
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.470
I don't think I'm going to watch any of them because yours truly has been
crashed

94
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.490
at the gym.
I go to the gym every day.

95
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.190
It's just become pop me life.
Right?

96
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.090
And you don't want a bay while you go to the gym every day.
You can't.

97
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.730
Right.
So,
um,
I just been going,

98
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.930
what's the matter?
Ain't get the cake.
Yeah,
we're on good terms again,
right?
Yeah.

99
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.360
You're like me and Nia had the classic male female argument that no matter how

100
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:09.680
much time do you give them,
they're never ready.
You're never ready.
Hey Nia,

101
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.800
listen,
what goes to a party Thursday,
uh,

102
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.930
June 26th,

103
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.510
2017 can you be ready by four ouncer I just,

104
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.600
I just don't get it.

105
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.340
I sit there and I was driving back from where I was coming from.
Right.

106
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.380
Jeremy was some friends,
man.
So I called you and I said,
Hey,

107
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:32.530
I'm 15 minutes away.
And you're like,
oh,

108
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.530
still trying to decide what I want to wear.

109
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.000
And I said,
okay.
The hung up and do you know why I was yelling at the windshield?

110
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.710
Because he knew I wasn't going to be ready.
I was just like,
hi,
you're not ready.

111
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.340
How is she not ready?
She had three and a half hours,

112
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.540
three hours and 20 minutes to get ready and you were not ready.

113
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.590
I thought that you were going to come in and change clothes.
I'm a guy.

114
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.470
I'm always ready.
I can,
I can literally get ready at eight minutes.

115
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.640
But you're right.
I did watch that last episode of making a murderer.

116
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.593
I knew you did.

117
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.220
I can get ready to eight minutes and back in the day it was 15 yes.

118
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.400
Sit down.
I want you to come here.
Let's say that again into the microphone.

119
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.190
Tell me what happened.
I was watching the last episode of making a murderer.

120
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.710
Um,
don't binge watch that series if you haven't watched it.

121
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.550
It's not good for your soul.
But I had to stop watching it.
Yeah.

122
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.520
And then I want to sign the petition to help that guy up.
Uh,

123
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.980
let's stay on.
Sorry.
Okay.
Yeah.

124
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.330
Forget about the guys wrongfully imprisoned for the second time.

125
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:34.830
Let's start with what me and my selfish needs.
Yeah.

126
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.650
So I watched the last episode that,
and then I fell asleep on the couch.
Okay.

127
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:41.610
So that's what happens.
So all the histrionics.

128
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.350
So then we were driving to the party.
We're driving to the party,

129
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.210
she's dressed up,
I'm dressed up,

130
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.610
we're both staring straight ahead now talking to one another.

131
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.920
And as we're pulling up the fucking driveway,
she goes,
oh,

132
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:59.480
we should have brought a bottle of wine or something.
And then I said,
well,

133
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.000
God knows she had plenty of time to do it.

134
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.150
And you know what the evening is?

135
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.090
Michael Corleone would say was,
oh,

136
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.880
godfather part two.

137
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.780
It was over and for the rest I got to give it to you if the rest of the party

138
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.890
you smiled and you pretended like we were a cohesive couple.
That's true.

139
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.730
Yes you did.
And you acted like he cared for each other though.
No,
he didn't.

140
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.170
I actually went into the kids' room and I watched fast and furious with the kids

141
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.650
and enjoyed it at the same level that they did because I'm immature is health

142
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.880
and I just,
you know,

143
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:36.881
chatted with other people about making a murderer and soaked in bleach.

144
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.270
Okay.
So then we get home and she still hasn't said anything.

145
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.640
I remember we pulled up in the driveway and then she goes,
you know,

146
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:45.950
I'm going to get out now.
And it just got out,

147
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:49.250
walked around the car and went into the house and I'm like,
oh,
she's mad.

148
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.260
And then we go downstairs and you are putting fresh sheets on the bed.

149
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:57.100
And I said something about his sleeping in the bed today together and just

150
00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:59.350
looked at me and said,
Oh,
I'm sleeping here tonight.

151
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.130
At which point I just tapped it.
The German Irish of wealth.
Fuck you.

152
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.670
I can play the silent game all night and I didn't say another word to you.

153
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.460
Well we talked a little bit.
No,

154
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.030
you tried to initiate it because you realized that no matter how much you hate

155
00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:17.710
me,
you like sleeping next to me in a bed and I do love stuff with that

156
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:21.740
condescending tone.
No
sleeping next to you.

157
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.810
It's weird.
If I were to sleep in a different place personally,

158
00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:27.290
I was looking forward to it.
I had,

159
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.680
I had the fucking NHL network ready to be queued up the second you walked out

160
00:09:32.681 --> 00:09:36.430
and then you came in and then I literally had to fake asleep like I was eight

161
00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:39.910
years old,
which I did,
which is pretty sad,
right?

162
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.200
Like nudge you because you left your laptop on the bed and I was like,

163
00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:47.770
can you put this on here?
And I was mature enough not to say,

164
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.020
I almost said I thought you weren't sleeping here

165
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.103
<v 3>and you've been</v>

166
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.340
<v 1>stop up the stairs extra loud to reinforce I'm leaving now.</v>

167
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.790
At which point I wouldn't have done anything and then you come.
Don't,
don't,

168
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:06.990
don't,
don't back down.
I really can't tell you.
Oh,

169
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.720
maybe some of it though.
Okay,
so you go.
All right.

170
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.160
So in the future,
Nia,
just give yourself an extra four,
five,

171
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.770
seven hours.
No,
I know,

172
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:24.360
but it's like I never know what to fucking wear and then I had to figure out how

173
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.970
I want to wear my hair based on the outfit.

174
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.880
Do you ever think this is why men are more successful aside from sexism and all

175
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:33.714
that shit?

176
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.920
It just takes you guys too God damn long to get ready because I like to look

177
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:42.480
nice and I,
you know,
but it does take me too long to get ready.

178
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.510
It's true.
I'm overthinking it a lot of the time,
so I won't take that.
Tell you,

179
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.280
you shave your head of cuts at least five minutes off the prep time.

180
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.010
Oh well I'll make,
I'll make a note of little [inaudible] thing you gotta do,

181
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.830
you know,
style it up.
What does that noise you made?
I was supposed to be me,

182
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:01.980
Robin and the Moose in my hands back in the day when he used to style it up.

183
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.420
You know,

184
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.780
all back in the day when you used to put the fraud act in your hair when I was

185
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:12.540
young.
When you had here.
Yeah.
All right.
Get out of here.

186
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.500
Go get your cake.
I'm going to go pick up the Christmas Day.
All right.

187
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.890
Merry Christmas everybody.
Merry Christmas to you and you are forgiven.

188
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.570
I am forgetting your forget.
Yes for being a jerk face yesterday.
All right,

189
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.280
I'll take them.
Okay.
And deal.
All right.
Get out of here.

190
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.890
There we go.
There we go.
Um,
tragedy.

191
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.660
Avert it.
Oh,
I stuck with them out.
Oh,

192
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:41.190
I stayed in the pocket on that one.

193
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.700
She tried to turn it around about all the shit that I'm doing,
you know?

194
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.240
And I was just like,
Hey,
I know all the shit where doe God knows.

195
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:51.510
I know all the shit we're doing and I know that I'm doing and I know you know

196
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:54.230
that shit that I'm doing it.
I'm fucking on it.
You know,

197
00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:58.730
I haven't yelled about sports on speaker phone the whole fucking week.
All right?

198
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.770
I haven't done that once.
And that gave me credibility.
All right,

199
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.340
to never fucking ready.
I don't give a fuck how much time you give them.

200
00:12:07.341 --> 00:12:08.900
They're never fucking right.
Anyone kills me.

201
00:12:08.901 --> 00:12:11.600
Then they get in the car and they're putting their fucking makeup on and then

202
00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:14.480
over the years you got all that makeup on.
The fucking vice

203
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.400
drives me nuts.
They're like,
oh Geez is an eyeliner and lipstick.

204
00:12:19.401 --> 00:12:22.270
Somehow it gets on your fingers and it's like,
it's like sort of going,

205
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.600
it's like an adult five-year-old,
you know?
Do you fucking have a kid?

206
00:12:26.601 --> 00:12:29.660
You know there's going to be cheerios and shit all over your car,
right?

207
00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:30.980
And if you've got to broaden your life,

208
00:12:30.981 --> 00:12:34.280
there's going to be makeup all over the Fed.
They don't give a fuck,
you know,

209
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.600
and you bring it up in your own country way.
What do they do?
They cry.

210
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.660
You know what they,
you know what I'm going to make my million dollars on.

211
00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:46.430
I'm going to make a fucking adult baby seat for a woman.
Right?

212
00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:51.200
So when she's in a bad mood,
like what I do for a family,
just sticker in there.

213
00:12:51.201 --> 00:12:55.550
Right?
And you got a fucking pacifier that's like Chai Latte,

214
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.100
fucking Frappaccino,
whatever the fuck they liked.

215
00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.780
Flavor to be all these different flavors.

216
00:12:59.781 --> 00:13:04.781
Pie Adult pacifiers for women and you stick it in there and then you leave.

217
00:13:04.881 --> 00:13:07.370
Right?
I know it was a lot of women listening right now.
Well what about,

218
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.540
what about one for guys and all I say to is that why don't you come up with an

219
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.650
original idea
joining the NFL hoe.

220
00:13:15.651 --> 00:13:19.850
You guys got a lot of nerve.
This is really country for the holidays,
isn't it?
Um,

221
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.640
let's see.
Typing in my password here.

222
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.260
Every fucking God damn day.
Here we go.

223
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.830
Here we go in.
There we go.
Alright,
let's,
what are we going to talk about?

224
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.400
So anyways,
my big thing,
um,

225
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.130
I've been dying to cook something cause the holidays Bodo [inaudible] are here

226
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.750
and I like to have some big tray of something that people could just be eating

227
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:44.990
on when the hanging around the house.
I got some family coming in.

228
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.490
It's possible that a New Jersey Zone,

229
00:13:49.491 --> 00:13:53.270
the pride of Newark,
the Trenton All star himself,

230
00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:57.290
Paul Versey might be staying here for a couple of days.
So,
uh,

231
00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.000
there's this thing I was watching,

232
00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.980
I was watching an old molto Mario Mario Batali on,
um,

233
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.560
on youtube and I can't believe I used to watch that shit like 15 fucking years

234
00:14:09.561 --> 00:14:10.394
ago.

235
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:11.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

236
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.500
<v 1>Where's the fucking time going?
Right.</v>

237
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.490
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.780
<v 1>Unbelievable.
I used to watch that,</v>

239
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.830
but at a Dadda Dadda Dadda I used to watch it every fucking day at noon and uh,

240
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.400
I didn't even try 99% of the shit that he was making.
I never even tried it,

241
00:14:26.401 --> 00:14:29.100
but just watching him every day,
I just kind of started to learn stuff.

242
00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:31.050
So he makes this Lazada Nah.

243
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.163
<v 2>MMM.</v>

244
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.420
<v 1>That is,
that looks just absolutely fucking insane.</v>

245
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.410
And it's like a spinach type lasagna noodle that he makes,

246
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.380
which I've never tried.
And uh,

247
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:48.760
I want to make a fucking tray or that like the day before Versie comes out.

248
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.890
All right.
Just so I can make sure if I fuck it up,
I don't get,

249
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.750
I don't serve it to them cause they'll Sicilians,
they never fucking forget.

250
00:14:56.751 --> 00:14:58.070
Right.
So I'm going to,

251
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:01.910
I'm definitely going to try to bang that out and then he's got this,
uh,

252
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.000
what was this hunter's chicken or some shit that looks fucking incredible.
Um,

253
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.501
I dunno,

254
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.380
I go through these phases where I just like cooking so I'm back into that type

255
00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:15.500
of shit.
So I'm gonna try and do that.
I've been crushing it that to Jim anyways.

256
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.420
I haven't gone there yet today.
Um,

257
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.500
but I didn't know if it's open because it's new year's Eve,

258
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:23.270
but down near where I played drums,

259
00:15:23.271 --> 00:15:28.130
this is open area where it's got like pull up bars and like jungle gym shit.

260
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.860
But like for adults and like homeless people that hang out around,

261
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.420
you know what I mean?
It's definitely,

262
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:34.370
if you have your sweatshirt on and you get a little hot,

263
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.670
you leave it on because you know,
if you turn your back it's going to be gone.

264
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.500
Or some homeless guys going to be using it as like a pillow.
Um,
hey,

265
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:46.100
it's this bad.
I was watching last night when I was ignoring my wife,

266
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:49.520
being a fucking child myself.
Uh,

267
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.660
and they were interviewing these homeless people who have like no place to go

268
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.750
and all of that type of stuff.
And they were just saying,
you know,

269
00:15:56.751 --> 00:16:00.050
we sit here and we see people shopping for Christmas and you know,

270
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:04.430
I'm thinking like,
uh,
you know,
I wish I had a family.

271
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:07.490
I wish I had somewhere to go and it was making me feel bad,
but you know,

272
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.500
I just went to which one time they just interview just the lazy homeless person

273
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:13.650
who was just like,
yeah,
you know,

274
00:16:13.651 --> 00:16:18.651
I just never liked having a job and a one thing came to another and I ended up

275
00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:23.300
out here and uh,
you know,
kinda sucks in the winter,
but overall it's not bad,

276
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.530
you know,
for as much as I wear the same pants every fucking day,

277
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:31.520
I can take a nap whenever I want to.
I don't have anybody telling me what to do.

278
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.960
Right.
I'm eating,
drinking,
I'm fucking hanging out.

279
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.500
Just sort of existing and stills gets still gonna suck.

280
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.520
I think it'd be better to be homeless out in the woods.
He sure enjoying nature.

281
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.060
Right?
If I was fucking homeless,

282
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:51.300
I'd be homeless down here like a ballpark.
Now,
where can he go?

283
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.200
Can you take a shower?
The big thing is you got to take a shower.

284
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.140
It would be awesome is if he knew someplace we could shower in a place where you

285
00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:03.440
could steal new clothes every four to five days and then you could just sort of

286
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:07.580
walk around it,
just not have a fucking job.
You know,

287
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.360
sleep outside.
You get used to it after a while.
I mean,

288
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.210
when you really think about it as much as they are homeless,
don't they?

289
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:18.590
Just sorta of cavemen and the modern day and we would fucking slap outside.

290
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.710
Back in the day,
native American slept and teepees.

291
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.270
You had a little bit of shelter.

292
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.640
You can't tell me like a box isn't in the same family tree as far as shelter.

293
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:32.480
It's lower than a teepee or a fucking cave.
You know,

294
00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:34.370
like when they do the coaches like tree,

295
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:36.460
like I was telling you where Paul Brown under the,

296
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.280
in his coaching tree was Don Shula,
Bill Walsh,
chuck Noll,

297
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.160
blood grant.
Like say like the cave,

298
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:48.050
you got the cave and the family tree off of that.
It's got to be the fucking tp,

299
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:50.390
the Wigwam,
the box,

300
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.830
a refrigerator with no door on it.
Right.

301
00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.790
That'd be an interesting series.
The upside of being homeless.

302
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:02.530
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

303
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.480
<v 1>I think it's even better.
I feel like just,
uh,
if you sort of a booze hound,</v>

304
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.350
you know,
I don't mean like just like killing yourself.

305
00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:14.920
I just mean like shit faced.
Like every day you drink,

306
00:18:14.921 --> 00:18:18.610
like you'd go into a game and he just keeps fucking hammered.
Right.

307
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.140
And you just sorta hanging out on the street.
I'm sorry,
appeal.
I'm trying to,

308
00:18:23.141 --> 00:18:25.120
you know,
this podcast started out so negative.

309
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:28.180
I figured I'd take something negative and maybe put a little sunshine on it.

310
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.580
You know,
like I tell,
you know,
it was crushing it.

311
00:18:30.581 --> 00:18:33.210
People who are homeless in Santa Monica,
you,

312
00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.960
you're literally homeless where people vacation,
you know,
or like Marina del Rey.

313
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.040
Just walking around looking for a boat.
Nobody's been on in a minute.

314
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.613
<v 0>Right?</v>

315
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.030
<v 1>Curl up on the deck.
Just laying there.
I are meaty.</v>

316
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.770
All right.
Maybe it does suck.
I think it would just get exhausting after a while.

317
00:18:52.771 --> 00:18:55.980
Cause I've,
I've locked myself out of the house,
you know,
a couple of times,

318
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.380
more times than I would like to admit.
And I gotta tell you,

319
00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:02.190
just sitting around outside is a,
it's fucking exhausting.

320
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.680
It's probably why cavemen were never fat.
A lot of people these,

321
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:05.610
cause they didn't eat as much,

322
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:10.611
but it was just that exhausting the stress of not having a door that you could

323
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:14.940
just fucking close and lock and know that nothing was going to come along and

324
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.450
eat you.
I think,
uh,
I think that stress alone.

325
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.800
<v 0>Did I just invent a new diet?</v>

326
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.470
<v 1>Hi everybody.
This is bill burr.
I have a new diet for you.</v>

327
00:19:26.471 --> 00:19:31.150
It's called the remove your front door and go to sleep at night diet.

328
00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.860
You'll wake up every eight seconds.
So the stress of it,

329
00:19:33.861 --> 00:19:38.380
it's gotta be something in there.
He was throwing yogurt and just say probiotic.

330
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:39.543
You know,

331
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.480
do you ever wonder why our ancestors were in such great shape is cause they were

332
00:19:43.481 --> 00:19:48.170
in fear for their lives 24,
seven even when they were sleeping,
they,
their,

333
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:49.750
their metabolism was still going.

334
00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:53.120
Cause at any second they realized that they might have to outrun a Willdabeast.

335
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:54.220
Right.

336
00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.940
If we could just somehow get back to that three days a week if he just removed

337
00:19:57.941 --> 00:20:02.941
your front door and went and fell asleep on the couch closest to the front to

338
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.400
the front door.
You know,
that reminds me,

339
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:11.110
I remember one time at the shady chick on the road and we fucking hooked up.

340
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.720
And,
uh,
it seemed,

341
00:20:14.721 --> 00:20:19.721
everything was cool at first and then like she started telling her story,

342
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.270
you know,
you start steering the conversation towards sex,
you know what I mean?

343
00:20:23.271 --> 00:20:25.880
Just,
you know,
Shit,
you're doing your 20s,
you don't have any game.

344
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.550
And she started telling me how.

345
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.830
<v 0>Okay,</v>

346
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.190
<v 1>we haven't yet gone going back so far you make when you talked to a woman,
right?</v>

347
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:37.100
And you start talking to them about sex.
Okay.
And they're open to it.

348
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.680
And yet they had that experience where you're like,
oh yeah,
here we go.

349
00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:41.360
It's all set.
It's all set,
it's all set.

350
00:20:41.361 --> 00:20:45.650
And then it just passes that tipping point to be like,
ah,
well,
you know,
I got,

351
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.040
you know,
obviously gonna wear,

352
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.790
it's not that bad all the way to the point of like,
holy fuck,
all right.

353
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.740
You know what?
I forget it.
Forget it.
You know,
this was a bad idea.

354
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.090
That's what happened with this.

355
00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:02.150
This person was open and I was discussing things and uh,

356
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.270
I don't know how we went from a,
hey,
I think he kind of cute.

357
00:21:06.271 --> 00:21:10.320
You want to hang out to her telling me that she hosted a sex party.

358
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.120
And I was like,
Oh,
I'm sorry,
what,
what,
what?
What'd you say?
She goes,

359
00:21:15.121 --> 00:21:19.410
I hosted a sex party.
And she said,
I said,

360
00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:22.710
what is a a,
what's a sex party?
She goes,
well,
you know,

361
00:21:22.711 --> 00:21:27.711
you rent out all the rooms on the same hotel floor and then everybody just

362
00:21:29.701 --> 00:21:34.020
leaves their doors open and people just walk around going in and out of each

363
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:36.450
room and you just fuck whoever is in there.

364
00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.140
So at that point I decided that,
all right,

365
00:21:45.141 --> 00:21:48.680
I don't know if I have the level of protection.

366
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.890
I don't know if they make a condom for that.
So,

367
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.400
uh,
what,

368
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.890
what did we did things that there was no way that you could get catch anything

369
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.680
is basically it.
And then I didn't know how to get her out of there,

370
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.600
so we fucking fell asleep.
And I,

371
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:07.750
this is when I was really introverted and didn't know how to say what the fuck I

372
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:08.231
was thinking.

373
00:22:08.231 --> 00:22:11.560
I remember she was sleeping on the right side of the bed and it just so happened

374
00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:15.970
my watch,
uh,
was on that side,

375
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.910
nightstand and I was on the other side of the bed and I swear to God,

376
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:22.960
I woke up like fucking like 58 times at night.
Just kept getting up,
looking,

377
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:27.310
seeing her there and making sure the watch was there rather than just being
like,

378
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:29.680
listen,
can,
uh,
can you just get the fuck out?

379
00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.350
I wouldn't say if you get the fuck outta here.
Uh,
but you know,

380
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:35.860
I bet I lost a lot of weight that night.
All right,
you guys ready?

381
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.030
You guys ready for some advertising with this fucking battling before the,
uh,

382
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.310
before Christmas here for the fuck.
Where in hell is it?
There it is.
Oh,

383
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:49.630
we got one.
He's down to one people.
Only one read.

384
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.780
Ah,
Jesus Christ.
I feel like a coach.
It's about ready to get fired.
All right.

401
00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:01.310
think sells itself via to hire somebody.

402
00:24:01.311 --> 00:24:04.550
I didn't want to go through all the fucking rig tomorrow,
right?
You're like,

403
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:08.810
how am I cursed and used an old person?
Think I said when the fucking,

404
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:12.190
and they also said Rick Tomorrow.
Um,

405
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.310
or maybe he didn't like it anyways.
Yeah.
Why wouldn't you use that shit?

406
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.410
Okay.
Pill.
We get it.
All right.
You're,
you're a little on edge.
This is,

407
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:22.730
this is how I act when I'm happy.

408
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.760
I still have tremendous level of anger.

409
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.530
I don't know what it is.
I'm trying to get rid of it,
you know,
it is.

410
00:24:30.531 --> 00:24:31.580
I am played drums today.

411
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.190
I haven't worked out and I'm bouncing off the fucking walls and you know,

412
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.520
my wife goes,
she,
you know,

413
00:24:35.521 --> 00:24:38.020
we're having people over and she wants me to go get a cake.
Insulin.

414
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.030
I'm saying like,
why don't you just have me fucking make one?
You know?
She's like,

415
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:43.160
it's just either it's down the fucking street.
She goes,
oh,
can,

416
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:46.730
can you go get the cake?
Can you go get the fucking cake?
And it's just like,

417
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.501
oh yeah,
yeah,

418
00:24:47.501 --> 00:24:52.370
you mean from the bakery that's in the opposite direction of where I'm going?

419
00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.900
And she goes,
oh,
I didn't know that.
I go,
you know where my gym is?
She goes,
hmm.

420
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.800
Where is,
okay wait,
I know.
Where is it again?
It's just like,
well,

421
00:25:01.801 --> 00:25:06.560
you stopped doing that.
I know.
You know where it is.
I know.

422
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:09.110
I just called you out on it and now you're going to try to polish.
It's just,

423
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:13.960
they think,
you think he's so fucking dumb.
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

424
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.340
I'm even getting sick of my voice on this one.
I'm sorry man.

425
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.050
I don't know what happened.
I mean,
I,
I,
you know,
I came here,

426
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:23.090
I thought that this was going to be like a Christmas special.

427
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.960
Evidently it's not going to be so settling.
Um,

428
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.030
people were sending me a,
uh,

429
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.060
this video of this Pelican eating a pigeon alive of course,

430
00:25:34.431 --> 00:25:37.310
because a Pelican can't hold a pistol or a knife.

431
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.210
So basically what happens is a Pelican just sort of walks up,

432
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.790
turns his head to the side and uh,

433
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:49.040
puts the bird and it's a big giant double Chin and a,

434
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:52.670
you know,
just sorta whacks it on the head with it's beak.

435
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.610
Like they don't really have to,
they have teeth.
I don't think they do.

436
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.390
One of the comments that he said they got bit by one said it didn't hurt.

437
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.610
Maybe they were trying to be macho.
And let me see this is,

438
00:26:03.611 --> 00:26:05.600
will this put me on a list?
If I look this up,

439
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.170
two Pelicans have teeth,

440
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.680
uh,
oil.
There's a picture right there.
Let's see.
Images for two.

441
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:19.430
Pelicans have teeth.
I don't see any,

442
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.310
I don't see any at all.

443
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:29.000
They definitely got a veiny fucking double chin.
That's the worst man.

444
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:31.940
As you get old and you get that fucking Pelican Chin,

445
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.600
that's why you got to do the cardio because you fucking skin on your face is

446
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:40.190
going to fall anyways just because of gravity.
But good Lord.
I'll tell you,

447
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:42.890
nothing makes me want to do cardio then looking at a fucking pillock.

448
00:26:42.891 --> 00:26:46.530
I need to fucking pigeoned.
Right.
All right.
Let's see here.

449
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.940
There are more than half a dozen species of telecons.

450
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:53.490
Don't you hate when the Internet just won't answer your fucking question

451
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:56.760
immediately?
It's like,
I'm dumb.
Can you just help me out here?

452
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.240
I don't need the entire history.
It's like when you buy a history book,

453
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.810
they always like,
okay,
let's read about the history of World War II.

454
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.580
They always got to start 20 years before.
It's like,
I get it,
shit happened,

455
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:11.230
and then they started fighting.
Can you get to the fucking battles already?

456
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:16.320
You got to get like 80 pages in before the thing starts.
All right.

457
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:18.540
There were over half a dozen species of Pelicans,

458
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.280
but all of them have the famous throat pouch.
Oh,

459
00:27:23.281 --> 00:27:27.150
is that what they call a double chin?
I said,
good and sell for somebody.

460
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.230
I don't know buddy.
Yeah.
Really?

461
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.170
I want you to take care of that fucking throat pouch.

462
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:37.440
It's a Pelican reference,
uh,
for which the birds are best known for these.

463
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:42.280
I bought the bar,
plastic pouches to catch fish through Yada,
Yadda,

464
00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:43.114
Yadda.
And many,

465
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:48.230
many Pelicans fish by swimming in cooperative groups stay more form a line or a

466
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:53.700
u shape.
I don't give a shit.
All right.

467
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:55.800
How about this?

468
00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

469
00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:59.110
<v 1>Pelican bite.</v>

470
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.690
A kid bitten by.
Okay.
This is a kid getting bit by a Pelican.
Not this kid cries.

471
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:09.390
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

472
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.430
<v 1>we know that he's got some teeth.</v>

473
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:16.170
<v 5>Here we go.
Do you wanna stand near him and I'll take a photo.
Yeah,</v>

474
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.033
but that parent

475
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.930
sounded more like the uncle

476
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.420
<v 1>no longer is this fucking video.
All right.
It's only 58 seconds.</v>

477
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:33.580
<v 5>Oh,
all right.
But the little five ladies,
if the toddler</v>

478
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.343
fucking

479
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.730
<v 1>yeah,
he's fine.
He gave him a little nip.</v>

480
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.880
You bit him in the shoulder.
In the back.
Yeah.

481
00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:52.090
It would've been so fucking funny to get the kid in there and the kid was

482
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:55.180
wiggling around like the fuck I dead bird.

483
00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:01.900
Uh,
Jesus Christ and see if there's an alarm on Pelican bites.
Man at the zoo.

484
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.850
Let's see if this guy could take it.

485
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:16.700
Hi Judge.
You by that guy.
Unless he's a fucking masochist.
Yeah.

486
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.560
They don't have teeth,
you know,
so it's so fucking funny.

487
00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:25.970
I don't even know why I was looking at that up.
Why was I looking it up?
Oh yeah,

488
00:29:25.971 --> 00:29:29.150
so they,
I guess that's why the,
the,
the pigeon was suffering so bad.

489
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:33.050
He had the fucking swallow that thing whole and then he just sort of bags it on

490
00:29:33.051 --> 00:29:34.280
their head.
You know,
we opens,

491
00:29:34.281 --> 00:29:36.680
it closes its mouth just banging on the fucking head.

492
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.270
I think at that point he's just trying to bust up its wings.
I Dunno.

493
00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:43.283
<v 0>Okay.</v>

494
00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.460
<v 1>From what I saw was kind of like getting beaten to death by a ruler where it</v>

495
00:29:47.461 --> 00:29:49.630
would be somebody just kept hitting in the head with it.

496
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.600
It would be like annoying,
more so than a devastating,

497
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.463
you know.

498
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.663
<v 0>Okay.</v>

499
00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:58.420
<v 1>I guess,
you know,
if,</v>

500
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.580
if you're going to get beaten to death with something when you want it to be

501
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:04.660
like a machete,
I want against sue somethings,
you know,
one one and done.

502
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.450
It's kind of like if you're going to get eaten by a shark,

503
00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.460
you want a great white right and you want to know it's coming and you stick your

504
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:15.580
face under the water,
see where it's coming,

505
00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:19.630
and then you just swim head first right into it's fucking mouth just ended.

506
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.940
They'll come up and take a chunk out,

507
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:26.941
a part of my hip and my torso to see if I'm edible and then fucking swim around.

508
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:29.730
And as I'm sitting there going like,
Oh God,

509
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.670
Oh fuck that head first.
Right into the goddamn think.

510
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.470
That's what I say.
A lot of people say punched the shark and the nose,

511
00:30:38.471 --> 00:30:40.090
so it goes away.
I don't say that.

512
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.560
I say stick your head right and it's fucking mouth.
Um,
all right.

513
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.520
Is that going to be an,

514
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.740
I thought there was a few of the things I wanted to talk about.
Uh Oh,

515
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.770
I mentioned,
I'm still saying with the Mike Johnston Bass drum work on,

516
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.980
I'm going to go try and do that today.

517
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:57.850
Hopefully if the rehearsal spaces open Pelican,
eating pigeon,

518
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.640
if any other drummers out there to want to listen to something cool.

519
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.370
I just looked up a Stewart Copeland,
uh,

520
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:08.050
drums only and uh,
you know,
saw,
you know,
synchronicity,

521
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.200
Roxanne and all that and all that little cool slick shit he's doing on his high

522
00:31:13.301 --> 00:31:14.740
hat.
Um,

523
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.850
sometimes those patterns he does on the ride cymbal with the bell.

524
00:31:18.851 --> 00:31:23.710
It's fucking really fucking cool.
Um,
so that's it.
Everybody.
Uh,

525
00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:27.190
it's the,
it's Christmas Eve.
Christmas is tomorrow.
In case you didn't know.

526
00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:32.290
I want to wish all you guys and Merry Christmas,
happy Hanukkah,
happy Kwanzaa.

527
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.050
And uh,
you know,
I said this last week.

528
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:39.430
What do Muslim celebrate this time of year other than the death of infidels?

529
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.460
Alright,
wait,
Muslim.
Well,
they wouldn't have a Christmas.

530
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.650
They don't believe in Jesus.
What do Muslims do on Christmas?

531
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.220
All right,
this is NPR.
So you know,
it's going to be nice and liberal.

532
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.170
If it was Fox News,
I wouldn't have read it.

533
00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.600
I'll tell you what they do and they plot that death of Santa Claus.
Uh,
all right.

534
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:05.110
For many American Jews,
Christmas Day means Chinese food and movies.

535
00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:08.020
But how do American Muslim spend their time at Christmas?

536
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.970
Jesus is also revered as a prophet in Islam.
Islam.
I didn't know that.
Islam,

537
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.830
Muslim,
Muslims.
Um,
I always find people when they're passive,

538
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:19.270
aggressively racist.

539
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:22.210
What they do is they deliberately mispronounced like they say,

540
00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:26.860
Muslim instead of Muslim.
Right.
And I just did that with Islam.
I said Islam,

541
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:28.690
but that's just because I suck at reading.
All right?

542
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.010
Muslims and Christians believe that Jesus is the only messiah.

543
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:35.610
<v 0>Okay?</v>

544
00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:39.350
<v 1>Wait a minute.
There's no way we both agree with dad were fighting like this.</v>

545
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:45.230
It really is about oil.
I don't know what the fuck.
Okay.

546
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.040
Explains his Sharm Maha mode,

547
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.280
Mou d and Arabic teacher at Harvard University.
He points out that Jesus',

548
00:32:54.281 --> 00:32:58.670
his mother,
Mary,
is considered by Muslims to be a saint.
In fact,

549
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.000
there's an entire chapter in the Qur'an called Mary,

550
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:07.610
and the story of Jesus's birth is recounted in this chapter.
He says,

551
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.600
<v 0>okay,</v>

552
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.720
<v 1>this is why I think that everybody sorta was believing the same shit and we just</v>

553
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:15.260
swell.
Shut off.
You know,
it's like the Zildjian factory,
you know,

554
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:19.430
when they made symbols,
you know,
it was an Armand Zildjian,
you know,

555
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:20.720
he had his kids underneath them,

556
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:23.890
they all were great and then he dies and the two had gotten to a fight in the

557
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.730
next thing you know,
there was diligence and bits,
right?
A Christmas Day,

558
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.300
Maha mode,
and is devout Muslim family fast.

559
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:33.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

560
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.010
<v 1>Oh God,
that's so fucking smart.
Fucking whale.
After tomorrow,</v>

561
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.860
we also relate the story of Jesus and Mary says,

562
00:33:40.861 --> 00:33:45.210
we read those passages in the Koran and we make sure the holidays focus through

563
00:33:45.211 --> 00:33:46.260
and through Jesus,

564
00:33:46.261 --> 00:33:51.261
peace and blessing be upon him as opposed to feeding into the commercialization

565
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.050
of this holiday.
Jesus Christ.

566
00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.300
Is this real or is this guy just nervous?
Cause he's in America on Christmas.
Uh,

567
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.690
that's not to say that some American Muslims never participate in more

568
00:34:03.691 --> 00:34:04.980
commercial side of Christmas.

569
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:09.180
All the Persians in my community went full blown Christmas the first year says

570
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:14.670
Comedians,
highroad norb Bosh.
Wow,

571
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:19.230
that's a fucking sick ass last name.
It ends with k.
H.
S.
H.
I mean,

572
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:23.550
my cousins even had a guy come over dressed as Santa.
Yeah.

573
00:34:23.551 --> 00:34:28.230
I mean that's like fucking white people celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
You know,
I,

574
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.840
I celebrate it.
And I also say,
what day of the year is it?

575
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:36.870
5th of May the a douchebag.
Okay.
Then there's the nuts.
Much going on approach.

576
00:34:36.871 --> 00:34:39.780
No one did anything in the home of,
all right.
All right.
All right.

577
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.650
Oh Jesus Christ.

578
00:34:40.651 --> 00:34:43.560
And then there's the kind of doing something but not really approach.
All right?

579
00:34:43.561 --> 00:34:45.150
So it gets,
it's a bunch of different ways to do it.

580
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.460
I didn't think the Muslim Muslim people,
uh,
even addressed now,

581
00:34:50.461 --> 00:34:52.110
wait a minute.
Do we address Muhammad?

582
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:54.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

583
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.430
<v 1>You are,
the problem is,</v>

584
00:34:55.450 --> 00:35:00.290
is religion is so fucking boring as a kid that you just want to get away from it

585
00:35:00.291 --> 00:35:03.200
as an adult.
So now that's Shit's actually interesting to me.

586
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.120
So it's all sort of the same people.
So it's kind of like a religious supergroup.

587
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.290
Right?
We got Lennon,
McCarthy,
Ringo and George Harrison.
You get cheeses,

588
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:15.880
you get Muhammad,
you got Abraham,
right?

589
00:35:15.881 --> 00:35:17.800
He's a guy led people out of the desert.

590
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.823
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

591
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.060
<v 1>And then who's the best?
Who's the food's Ringo?
Buddha.</v>

592
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.373
<v 0>Okay.</v>

593
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.560
<v 1>And they all kind of say the same shit,
right?
He was fucked up the other day.</v>

594
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:34.040
I was on a hike and I went by some desert plant that literally had like a

595
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:39.041
Stinger on it and I hit my finger on it and it felt like I got stung by a bee

596
00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:42.070
like a minute later.
And now my finger,
uh,

597
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.130
just in that area is black and blue,

598
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.420
but I don't have any tingling or anything like that.
So being that I'm a guy,

599
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.130
I won't read up on it,
nor will I go to the doctor.
So if I die by Monday,

600
00:35:54.131 --> 00:35:55.480
just know it was a,

601
00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:00.430
some sort of a exotic desert plant.
All right,
well,
you know what,

602
00:36:00.431 --> 00:36:05.140
then happy fasting,
um,
ice.
You know,
I used to do that once a week.

603
00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:09.340
I got into fasting for a minute.
I would do it like once a week.
I'll tell you,

604
00:36:09.341 --> 00:36:10.930
that's a great way to stay in shape.

605
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.630
Just not eat one day out of the fucking week,
you know,

606
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.960
provided if you do it the right way,
when you don't eat,

607
00:36:16.961 --> 00:36:19.810
you're not supposed to then just get out and drive a car and go to the gym and

608
00:36:19.811 --> 00:36:24.100
Shit.
You supposed to like fucking chill,
you know,

609
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.190
and a relaxed all day,

610
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.950
which of course I never did cause I'm a maniac.

611
00:36:29.951 --> 00:36:32.500
I actually know somebody that has a friend that uh,

612
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.170
the person eats every other day and I got to tell you,

613
00:36:35.171 --> 00:36:40.000
they're in great fucking shape.
You know what I mean?
Okay,

614
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.130
well I've talked myself into a corner.
Well listen,

615
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.780
I have a merry Christmas parties.
I've already wrapped this up like 10 times.

616
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.840
Enjoy the second half of the podcast where we got some throwback,

617
00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:53.980
a more dumb shit that I've said over the past few years.

618
00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:58.400
Actually the past decade and some music from are the one and only Andrew stem

619
00:36:58.401 --> 00:36:59.171
lists.
All right.

620
00:36:59.171 --> 00:37:04.171
And have yours [inaudible] yourself a merry little Christmas tomorrow.

621
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:36.730
It is a spring.

622
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.713
<v 0>Moses,</v>

623
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.370
you are the sunlight.

624
00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.573
So

625
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.200
it isn't hard to feel me.

626
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.360
<v 6>Alright.
Dilemmas for the week.</v>

627
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:20.110
Go to the bathroom like a cat number one and number two in a dresser drawer size

628
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:25.130
cat box and have a butler empty at every day or go to the bathroom like a dog

629
00:38:25.251 --> 00:38:29.930
outside in the bushes and have a Butler follow you around to pick it up and tell

630
00:38:29.931 --> 00:38:34.160
you that you're a good boy.
Oh,
that's no fights.
No Fiat that second one.

631
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.740
I do it outside.
Squat right down to the fucking pushes.

632
00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.000
I'm not shitting inside my house.
That's why I hate cats.

633
00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.470
Aside from the fact that they act like stuck up concert a club,

634
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.840
you know who've never done accomplished anything other than looking good in
life,

635
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:56.770
you know,
and they only come around when they fucking need something.

636
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.160
The only other reason why I don't like cats and say shit in the fucking house,

637
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.650
then I got to pick it up.
I don't like that.
They're not happy when I come home.

638
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.140
There's just no,
there's no give and take.

639
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:09.550
You know what it is when you have a cat,

640
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.520
you're basically Robert De Niro's character and casino.

641
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.830
That's what you are,
you know,
and your cat is Sharon Stone.

642
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.160
She's fucking,
she's just there for the amenities.

643
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:28.020
You fucking cunt go d and a Goddamn red roof inn.

644
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.670
All right.
So yeah,

645
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.610
I would definitely outside who doesn't like being told they were a good boy?

646
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.281
I get praised.

647
00:39:35.281 --> 00:39:38.590
What was the last time anybody out there got praise after they took a dump will

648
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:43.300
not be awesome,
you know?
I don't know.
All right,

649
00:39:43.301 --> 00:39:46.870
let's plow ahead.
Was that unfunny sir?
Did you not like that one?

650
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:49.060
Was that not up to your comedy standards?

651
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.600
Did you feel the rest of this podcast was funnier than that?

652
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:58.360
When I blew my nose before I went off on Jesus.
Oh,

653
00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.890
alright.
Let's just plow ahead here.
Number two.
Uh,

654
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.310
would you rather marry a stripper or have your daughter become one?

655
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.680
I'd rather Mary would rather marry one.
You know,

656
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.420
if my daughter becomes one,
that's just complete failure as a parrot.

657
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.210
And in fact that's what I think all those videos,

658
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.550
it should be called that you see,

659
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:27.830
you know when you see on Youtube when you got those girls do,

660
00:40:27.831 --> 00:40:31.810
when those booty dances,
you know the god damn shorts up their ass.
Like,

661
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.830
it's always like someone,
so booty dancing,
what it should be called is.

662
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:40.831
So it's so complete failure as a pair of results of a complete failure as a

663
00:40:44.021 --> 00:40:47.200
parent.
Absolutely.
I would rather,
that's not fair to the kid.

664
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.350
I would marry a stripper and,
uh,
you know,

665
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.370
I would just,
I would just have fun with the stripper.

666
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:59.620
I would just do whatever I could,
you know,
fucker is,

667
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:03.580
she had one leg pointed west and one lake pointed east,
you know,

668
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.970
or north and south if she's standing up drinking coffee,
you know,

669
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.560
doing like one of those little ballet moves.
I just bag like that and then,
uh,

670
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:16.240
yeah.
Then they have a kid and be like,
listen,
this is the secret in life,

671
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.283
sweetheart.

672
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.820
Don't do anything that your mother did when she does become a stripper.

673
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:25.990
Is that like a reality show that they haven't come up with the daughters of

674
00:41:25.991 --> 00:41:28.000
strippers?
Like what's her face?

675
00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:33.001
I think a Kurt Cobain's daughter is going to be all right because their is such

676
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:36.590
a fuck up that it thinks I probably just jinxed her.

677
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.600
I probably just chased her.
All right.
Number three,

678
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.030
uh,
choose between attack by a bear or a lion on land in between.

679
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:50.840
Attacked by a shark or a crocodile in the water.
No fucking contest,
dude.

680
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:55.460
I would take a barren bear or a lion.
That's a quick death.

681
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.620
That's a quick one.
That bear comes up with dead bionic bitch slap.
That's it.

682
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.460
You fucking breaks your neck.
You have a sea lion kill something.
That's it.

683
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:09.670
It's over like an that's going after like major prey and it just crushes you.

684
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:12.680
Fucking wind pipe.
You're out in two seconds.

685
00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:16.940
Did you ever yelled at footage of what's his face?
The Gay Lion Tamer out there.

686
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.170
The one who looked like,
uh,
uh,

687
00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:26.080
what's his face from night at the Roxbury?
The AH,
Jesus Christ is fuck it.

688
00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:30.530
Cold medicine.
What the fuck is the guy's name there?
Come on.
What was,

689
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:34.790
what's the name of that Guy Chris Catan.
That one.
The Gay Chris Catan.

690
00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:35.810
Do you ever see when that fucking,

691
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:40.400
that lion grabbed that dude and it was over in two seconds.
It would,

692
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:44.210
he just went limp.
I take that in a second.

693
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.690
As opposed to a fucking shark.
You sitting out there,
shark comes up,

694
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:51.560
first thing it does is it bites and dia leg to see if your edible right just

695
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:53.530
takes a nice chunk out and Kinda,
you know,

696
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.900
like he's doing some sort of wine testing with your fucking thigh meat.

697
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.540
You know what else kills me is the fact you can't fucking see it.

698
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:04.723
You know,

699
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.150
your heads above the water and all the evil is just below it and you're sitting

700
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:10.520
there,
you know,
and I think that you hit still,

701
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.890
you got that cavemen DNA that would,

702
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.760
that would just be going off that there was something in the area despite the

703
00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:21.000
fact that you couldn't see it,
you'd be trying to lift your fucking legs up.
I,

704
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.320
I think,
uh,
I think the real dilemma here is,

705
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:29.030
is between shark or a crocodile and,

706
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:33.770
uh,
I,
I would have to go,
I would have to go shark.

707
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.360
I just feel like they're,
it's a cleaner death.
You know,

708
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.010
they got those Ginsu knives,
teeth,
they just come in like a tiger shark.

709
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:44.990
It's just fucking over,
you know,

710
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:49.760
just a perfect fucking killing machine as they said and jaws.
But like a

711
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.080
alligators and crocodiles,
those fucking things.

712
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:58.010
Those are like those guys who aren't talent talented enough to be in the NFL,

713
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:02.180
the NHL.
So they just go out there and they tried to blow out guys knees,

714
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.043
you know,

715
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.330
alligators and crocodiles like the bill room and now skis of fucking predators.

716
00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.410
You know,
just that thing when they grab on to you.

717
00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.400
You know what I like about a shark?
It what?

718
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.670
You could just bite your leg off fucking alligator.

719
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:21.380
That they always seem to grab it and then they go into that role and they just

720
00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:23.190
sold slowly twisted off.
You know,

721
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.700
like you're some cooked chicken and they're trying to take the leg.

722
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:31.920
This is getting fucking morbid.
That's what I would choose.
All right,

723
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:34.080
what else do we got here?
Uh,

724
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:38.400
have a beautiful lady who stinks,
smelly breath,

725
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.350
smelly ass pussy pits,

726
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:45.351
hair the works all sticking or an ugly fat bitch who smells great.

727
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:52.650
Uh,
I go with the ugly fat girls.

728
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:57.520
Smells great.
Absolutely because I could,

729
00:44:57.521 --> 00:44:58.410
I could love her.

730
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:02.730
Where the other one who just smelled like shit but was beautiful.

731
00:45:02.731 --> 00:45:06.660
It was probably carried herself like a beautiful lady would annoy me after a

732
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:10.160
while it I probably kill her,
you know,

733
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.350
why did you kill her?
Cause her fucking pussy stunk.

734
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.800
And she walked around like she was just self.
Am I being charged with that?

735
00:45:17.801 --> 00:45:21.390
He think because if I am,
I want a lawyer.
Go Fuck yourself while Mr. Brewer,

736
00:45:21.391 --> 00:45:24.840
you really just already incriminated yourself.
I don't care.
You know,

737
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.100
the prison will not smell as bad as her ass.

738
00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:35.130
That was anything worse to fucking cold tea.
All right,
here we go.
Uh,

739
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.451
chimp,

740
00:45:35.451 --> 00:45:39.110
first line backer built my friends and I frequently get in an argument over

741
00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:40.760
whether a worlds,

742
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:47.620
a world's man competitor or NFL lineman could handle a chip and a fight.

743
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:53.020
I know chimps can rip faces off at our 10 times the strength of a normal man,

744
00:45:53.031 --> 00:45:55.040
but a normal man is a tub of shit.

745
00:45:55.700 --> 00:46:00.500
I bet a linebacker could rip some faces off to.
What do you think?
Uh,

746
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.730
yeah,
no contest.
The chimp would fuck the dude up.
Do Chimps don't fight.

747
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.020
I was going to happen.
I said fairly chips don't fight like people.

748
00:46:09.021 --> 00:46:11.390
They're not gonna,
you know,
you've got to come out,
come out and touch gloves.

749
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.630
They're going to fuck it.
Sorry.
He's got a great jab watch out for it's right.

750
00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.200
You know that fucking thing.
It's just going to jump on you.

751
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.310
I would tell you that time that monkey stole my hotel keys.

752
00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.610
I was at Costa Rica.
Um,

753
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.910
the fuck was I doubt of Costa Rica way out in the bush.
You know,

754
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:35.180
army ants took over my fucking little Cabana and that type of shit.

755
00:46:35.181 --> 00:46:38.750
So they had this pet monkey.
There of is a monkey.
I fucking hate monkeys.

756
00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.060
I never had a problem with chimps,

757
00:46:41.061 --> 00:46:44.150
but now that they'd rip people's faces off and then nuts and their feet off,

758
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.710
I have a problem with them.
Uh,
I like gorillas and I like orangutans.

759
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.700
Orangutans.
I was still,
it was tank t a g but it's wearing a tan.

760
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:56.660
I like those ones.
They seem like they've seen it all.
They've got that vibe.

761
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.900
They could just sit down and teach you about life.

762
00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.900
But those little monkey motherfuckers,
I can't stand it.
Right.

763
00:47:02.901 --> 00:47:05.930
So for some dumb reason,
cause I'm white,
I have to walk up to it.
A,

764
00:47:05.931 --> 00:47:07.370
there's a fucking wild animal.

765
00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.420
Let me put myself in danger and I walk up to this thing and a fucking jumps on

766
00:47:11.421 --> 00:47:16.280
me.
Uh,
you know,
and it's one of those,
you know,
remember that,

767
00:47:16.281 --> 00:47:19.240
that that video was shocked.
The monkey.
Okay.
Pop Up.

768
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.620
It was a little monkey that they was one of those monkeys.

769
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:27.390
The faces of death where they will fucking bag of that monkey's head till it

770
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:31.030
died.
That they ate his braids over that one.
Yeah.
It was one of those monkeys,

771
00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:34.150
right?
This fucking thing jumped on me.
It wasn't half a second.

772
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.900
It turned itself upside down,
was hanging by its tail from my neck,

773
00:47:37.901 --> 00:47:42.610
reached in my pockets,
grabbed my keys and ran back up a fucking tree.

774
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:48.310
This all happened like within like 1.8 seconds.
So my body reactions,
like what?

775
00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:52.750
Wait,
what?
What?
Ah Fuck.
So if this thing actually wanted to fuck you up,

776
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.570
the things that going to come out fucking bobbing and weaving,

777
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.570
it's going to be running around the room,
jumping up off of shit.

778
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.110
You got to try to figure out where it is and it's just going to fucking land on

779
00:48:02.111 --> 00:48:05.590
your face and that's going to be it.
It's going to tear your face off,

780
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:09.460
twist your foot off and rip your balls off and no linebacker stands a fucking

781
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:12.910
chance unless you know what,
what if they had on the equipment,

782
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:14.350
even though they tell you fingers off.

783
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:19.900
This is the amazing thing about how human beings survived,

784
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:23.440
is everything out there as far as I can tell,
is faster than us.

785
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.453
For the most part,

786
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.630
it is stronger that US faster and stronger,

787
00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.820
but for the simple fact that we were smarter,

788
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.900
we were able to do all the horrific things that we've done with this nature.

789
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.180
You know,
with this nature,
with this planet,

790
00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.470
you have to think about that shit.

791
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:47.140
Football players beat the fuck out of the nerds all through grade school and

792
00:48:47.141 --> 00:48:47.974
high school.

793
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.780
Then what happens from the real deal goes down the end of the day.

794
00:48:52.781 --> 00:48:57.781
Those nerds become bankers and those football players get enslaved and there you

795
00:48:58.421 --> 00:49:01.720
sit in your house like a caged animal at the fucking zoo.

796
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.990
And where's that banker?
You don't even know what the fuck he looks like.

797
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.670
All those Facebook cunts that God damn Steve Jobs.

798
00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.040
What are the most overrated human beings on the fucking planet?

799
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.263
They went in the end.

800
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:10.230
<v 1>Follow up from October.
Where do eggs come from?</v>

801
00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:11.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

802
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:13.950
<v 1>Where the eggs come out of.
Oh yeah.
I asked that.</v>

803
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.040
I asked does it come out of their ass?
Did they have a little chicken pussy?

804
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.060
A little chicken,
Eh,
Vagina.
Billy boy.

805
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:26.090
Just listen to the podcast from October and you sort of asked where eggs come

806
00:50:26.491 --> 00:50:31.370
out of a chicken.
He says,
I don't fuck chickens,
but,
well,
okay.

807
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:32.900
Yeah,
I do know where they come out of.

808
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:37.990
I know for a fact that the egg comes out of the hole that poop also comes out

809
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:41.540
of,
it's called the vent.

810
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.030
Bam educated.
You're welcome.

811
00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.990
<v 6>Oh,
that's disgusting.
Well,
no wonder that egg has a shell on it,
Huh?</v>

812
00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:53.800
So that's okay.
I can still eat eggs and not worry that I'm eating eggs shit.

813
00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:57.970
Right.
Cause it's in that little,
uh,
that little more capsule.

814
00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.700
<v 2>It's called the vent.</v>

815
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.650
<v 6>Why doesn't a Fuckin a</v>

816
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:05.490
<v 2>yeah.</v>

817
00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:10.250
<v 6>Oh,
a chicken have a pussy.
Is that because it's so small?</v>

818
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.740
Is that what it is?
Is it,
I'd like,
you know,
when you get a car and there's,

819
00:51:14.741 --> 00:51:18.250
you know,
you get the compact so there's not enough room for the radio.

820
00:51:18.251 --> 00:51:21.430
So they turn it sideways like in the Chevy citation.
Is that what it is?

821
00:51:21.431 --> 00:51:26.431
So they had to combine the ass hole and the birth canal l at the same time.

822
00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.453
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

823
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.240
<v 6>So every chicken takes it in the ass.
Is that what you're telling me?</v>

824
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:43.320
Where does the rooster just nowhere to go.
I didn't get pregnant again.

825
00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:45.750
It went up the shitter rather than up the vent.

826
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.520
Does a rooster have to bang a chicken at at a certain angle to make sure it goes

827
00:51:50.521 --> 00:51:53.490
up the vent?
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

828
00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:57.030
Is there a farmer out there that could show me a,
uh,

829
00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.280
send me a diagram?

830
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:00.700
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

831
00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:04.150
<v 6>it's got a,
it's got a split at some point doesn't it?</v>

832
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.440
They can't be some egg grown in your ass and you're also trying to take a

833
00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:12.950
chicken dump.
You'd be constantly constipated,

834
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.740
you know?
And when,
when chickens lay eggs,

835
00:52:16.741 --> 00:52:19.740
it's not like there's a bunch of shit all over it.
See Sir,
this is what it,

836
00:52:19.741 --> 00:52:21.900
this is the great thing about life is you ask,

837
00:52:21.901 --> 00:52:26.670
you answer a question and it just introduces all these others.
Now I realize,

838
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.600
you know,
it's like that little thing.
Like with each book I read,

839
00:52:30.601 --> 00:52:33.030
I realized this is so much less than I know.

840
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

841
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:40.540
<v 6>See that.
So now I have a,
I have a hundred more questions and you know what?</v>

842
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:44.040
You decided to reopen this Pandora's box.
Now w I need some

843
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.620
<v 1>followup.
I got any farmers out there.
Huh?</v>

844
00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:53.240
Anybody else could tell me
it's got a split off like one of those t splits.

845
00:52:53.241 --> 00:52:55.820
Like when you,
you know,
you and a friend listened to the same iPod.

846
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:58.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

847
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:01.250
<v 1>Eggs in one shit and the other.
That's like a game show.</v>

848
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:10.020
<v 6>It's time to play.
Put your hand and I'll put you a face under the chicken vent.</v>

849
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:14.620
What do you think it's going to be?
Roll a dice isn't going to be an egg or is it

850
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:19.680
<v 1>me?
Some chicken shit.
Um,
that's disgusting bill.
Well go fuck yourself.</v>

851
00:53:19.681 --> 00:53:20.820
I had to work with what I had there.

852
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:09.820
<v 6>Um,
Hey,
speaking of failure,</v>

853
00:54:09.821 --> 00:54:14.400
I actually went on to youtube and I know these say everybody's seen these a

854
00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:18.520
zillion times.
So you know what I love,
I love those compilation,
uh,
you know,

855
00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:22.810
fail videos of 2010,

856
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.050
2011 and uh,

857
00:54:26.051 --> 00:54:28.480
I was watching those laps night just laughing my ass off.

858
00:54:28.481 --> 00:54:30.010
Just having a good time for you bill.

859
00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:33.820
Is there any that you can remember that really a lot of face plants,

860
00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:38.470
a lot of people taking it in the nuts and uh,
I'll tell you,

861
00:54:38.471 --> 00:54:42.700
I can't believe what it takes to break your fucking neck because everybody was

862
00:54:42.701 --> 00:54:47.440
like doing back flips and then like water skiing on their face,

863
00:54:47.441 --> 00:54:52.441
like landing on their face and sliding three feet on the face and you're

864
00:54:52.751 --> 00:54:56.470
thinking there's no way that guy's getting up.
And every time they get,

865
00:54:56.471 --> 00:55:00.880
they get right back up.
This is something that I've noticed.

866
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:06.930
How bout the ladies is a lot of them because they spent their whole fucking

867
00:55:09.581 --> 00:55:14.581
lives trying to attract a man who invariably is going to disappoint him because

868
00:55:16.661 --> 00:55:21.420
he's a fucking idiot because he has a Dick,
right?
They spent so much time,
poof.

869
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:26.320
And their hair and Peyton up that God damn faces,
you know,

870
00:55:26.321 --> 00:55:31.321
like some Kabuki cloud getting out of a God damn folks wagon that they,

871
00:55:31.451 --> 00:55:34.990
a lot of them have the coordination of like a three year old,

872
00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:39.790
you know,
I'm not talking about the athletic ones,
the ones that throw like dudes,

873
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.450
you know,
have little grunt in there.

874
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.320
You got a new girlfriend you didn't realize.
Yeah,
you,

875
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.420
he played high school softball.
That's cool.
It yells,
go outside and play catch,

876
00:55:49.421 --> 00:55:52.660
right.
She's,
you see it.
She's already fucking amped up.
You know,

877
00:55:52.661 --> 00:55:56.050
she gets out there,
he's got that look in her eye or fucking nipples are hard.

878
00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:59.330
She's ready to go.
And you're out there going,
oh,
you know,
it's a lady.
Let's,

879
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:02.970
let's be easy.
So you tosser one,
you know,

880
00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:08.050
borderline aren't underhanded trying to respect of the J J right?

881
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.930
She's got a vagina,
not too hard.

882
00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:16.000
You Lob it over to her and then she throws it back and it gets a little grunting

883
00:56:16.001 --> 00:56:19.480
there.
Pops you.
Mit makes your hands staying a little bit,

884
00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:23.350
makes you a little bit nervous,
right?
The fuck am I with?

885
00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:28.360
I'm not talking about women like that.
I'm talking about,
you know the,
Oh my God,

886
00:56:28.361 --> 00:56:30.100
you guys,
that's so mean.

887
00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:35.070
<v 7>Lucas.
The Christmas lights.
Oh,
I love Christmas.</v>

888
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.793
<v 6>That girl,</v>

889
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:44.000
those when they fall off fucking tables or whatever the fuck it.

890
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:47.170
Oh there they are going on rope swings.
Like when they fall,

891
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:52.150
they look like a fucking taught lean.
I like toddlers.
Don't realize they do.

892
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.080
They don't know enough to put the hands out to protect their face or they just

893
00:56:56.081 --> 00:56:58.060
fall like a fucking sack of potatoes.

894
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:02.770
Those are my favorite videos because it's usually good looking women,
you know,

895
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.740
they're good looking so they know that all they gotta do is just do that Kabuki

896
00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:08.560
thing.
If every day they just fucking wake up,

897
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:12.700
take one of those giant powder things and slam their face with it.

898
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:18.990
Paint their lips red like a goddamn bullseye that you know much toe.

899
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.600
A lot of people should grin most of their dreams.

900
00:57:22.601 --> 00:57:24.520
They're going to come true or they got to come true.

901
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.330
You know what is [inaudible]?
The red lipstick,
everybody.

902
00:57:29.331 --> 00:57:32.180
I used to think it was cause your lipstick,
you know sort of a red,

903
00:57:32.181 --> 00:57:33.200
but it's a muted red.

904
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:38.210
You know it's an old school TV read as opposed to the high def HD.

905
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:42.800
Fucking a stick.
Your Dick in here read that.
The lipstick is,

906
00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:48.220
you know,
I dunno,
I'm officially an old bastard.
You know it's this.

907
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.380
This is when you add in for all you youngsters out there.
This is when you,
you,

908
00:57:51.381 --> 00:57:53.720
you,
you got to know that your old,
first of all,

909
00:57:53.721 --> 00:57:57.830
you're going to stutter uncontrollably for no apparent reason.

910
00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.000
But beyond that,

911
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.680
this is how you're going to know your old is when you get to that age where you

912
00:58:03.681 --> 00:58:08.681
can't tell if somebody is a hooker or if they work at the,

913
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:13.540
basically like a library or something hat got,
damn,

914
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:14.690
I should have a better example.

915
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:17.870
I can't tell the difference between a girl going out to the club or a girl

916
00:58:17.871 --> 00:58:22.790
walking down the streets sucking Dick for 20 bucks a pop.
You know,
because I,

917
00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:27.610
I've,
I've been old long enough that,
you know,

918
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.630
my idea of what a horror is,

919
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:34.910
the horrors of my generation already have kids who are like 18 1920 years of

920
00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:36.200
age.
All right?

921
00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:41.350
So now they're rebelling against their horror of a mother from the eighties

922
00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:45.260
early nineties so they have to outdo what she did.

923
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:50.330
And in the process they dress like hookers dressed when I was coming of age.

924
00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:55.580
I'm telling you when I'm out here and I'd drive down Hollywood boulevard where

925
00:58:55.581 --> 00:58:59.030
all the club scene is,
you know,
gee bill,
why do you go that way?

926
00:58:59.031 --> 00:59:03.270
There's all kinds of traffics cause I want to look at the ladies.

927
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:08.500
They're all out there.
I'll tell you what's in now.
Thick thighs.

928
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:12.460
Thank God about fucking time.
And I,
when I was a kid,

929
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.120
like a women,
they all had those skinny fucking legs,

930
00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.960
you know those little Chihuahua legs,
you know,

931
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:24.961
and they have fucking mustard pumps from the 80s remember those girls now all of

932
00:59:25.031 --> 00:59:27.910
a sudden it looks like this whole generation has been doing squats.

933
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:32.080
It's looking pretty good to me.
So anyways,
what the fuck am I talking about?
Oh,

934
00:59:32.081 --> 00:59:33.620
I was talking about why I was,
uh,

935
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.910
I mean I have no idea where that thought came from.

936
00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:42.550
Kind of fucked at up on mustard pumps.
I can't back it up.

937
00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.020
My brain doesn't go that way.

938
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.243
<v 2>You know,</v>

939
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.200
<v 6>I just have to keep going forward,</v>

940
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:51.590
which is why I'm sitting here with the podcast only going into my left ear and

941
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:55.250
not my right here,
but you know what?
And now,
like you feel bad for me,

942
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:57.770
but you know what,
I,
this has been a problem.

943
00:59:57.771 --> 00:59:59.510
This has been a reoccurring fucking problem.

944
00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:02.960
And all I do is wiggled the wires every week and be like,
okay,
now it's working,

945
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.650
you know,
knowing full fucking well that something bad's going to happen.

946
01:00:06.651 --> 01:00:10.340
It's like ignoring the fact that,
you know,
the check engine light just came on.

947
01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:17.840
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

948
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.200
<v 6>um,
money advice bill.
I'm an Otr truck driver.</v>

949
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:16.700
What the fuck is that?
Off Track
vetting.

950
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:19.630
What does that o t I don't know what that is.
All right,

951
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:20.870
I'll take your word for it.

952
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:26.930
I'm an Otr truck driver and have a problem with blowing fucking money like a

953
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:27.764
politician.

954
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.450
I have a wonderful fiance with a great head on her shoulders and she is great

955
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:36.350
with money.
Uh,
every time I see the bank statements,

956
01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:40.220
the balance is more and more so I know she's doing a bang up job with their

957
01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:42.710
finances.
Well,
let me tell you something,
sir.

958
01:01:42.711 --> 01:01:44.780
You are one perceptive son of a bitch.

959
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:51.680
He seen another beggar and I know that that must be a good thing.
Um,

960
01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:56.000
so what's the fucking problem you say?
Well,
like I said,

961
01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.420
I'm terrible with money,
so I got one of them.

962
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.890
I got one of them prepaid debit cards.
He literally wrote one of them.

963
01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:07.600
I liked this guy,
talks like Elvis,
uh,
and every Tuesday payday,

964
01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:12.610
my girl puts $50 on there so I can get groceries that way I don't turn into one

965
01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:17.450
of these fat shits that ate every meal out out of the Wendy's,

966
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:19.063
out of the,

967
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:24.140
<v 1>Ah,
God,
this guy is great.
He's man or Dan loaded up and trucking.</v>

968
01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.470
We going to do what they say can't be done.

969
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:31.160
We're gonna get some hookers at the next drug stuff.

970
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:35.720
We ain't can wear condoms and shoots some drugs and we'll all get fuckin aids

971
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:38.300
and pass it all around.
Um,
well,

972
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:41.300
$50 is good for one week of groceries,

973
01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.820
but it's like pulling fucking teeth for extra money like say for drinks or some

974
01:02:46.821 --> 01:02:51.020
rubbers?
No,
like for drinks or some extra curriculars.

975
01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.390
Am I an asshole for thinking I deserve a few extra bucks or what the fuck bill,

976
01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:02.480
by the way,
Nia has a sexy fucking voice and go fuck yourself.
Um,

977
01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

978
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.090
<v 1>Are you an asshole for thinking you deserve a few extra bucks?
Absolutely.</v>

979
01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.600
The fact that that poor woman is legally bound to you and you,

980
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:14.450
you have no concept of how to hold on to money,

981
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:17.780
that would be like,
I mean,

982
01:03:17.781 --> 01:03:21.710
you're a guy like you're supposed to fucking earn a living to support a family.

983
01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:22.573
Right?

984
01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:23.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

985
01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:27.510
<v 1>If you have no concept of that,
that would be like if she had no concept of,</v>

986
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:31.480
of like how to have a baby or how to blow somebody's,
you know what I mean?

987
01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:32.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

988
01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:35.700
<v 1>Cause that's what their job is sucking Dick and make it</v>

989
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:39.103
idiot.

990
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.430
Oh God.

991
01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:48.250
Measured by head of the balls to run for president after doing this podcast for

992
01:03:48.251 --> 01:03:52.350
five years.
How I,
how easy would it be to take me down?

993
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.393
<v 2>MMM.</v>

994
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.310
<v 1>Do.
Why don't you learn about money?</v>

995
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:04.480
Did you really just want to float around?
Like with your fucking eyes wide open,

996
01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:06.790
just not getting it.
Don't you want to understand money.

997
01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.140
She's given you 50 bucks a week.
You know why cause you to fucking stupid.

998
01:04:11.141 --> 01:04:11.974
He gets 60

999
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:13.180
<v 2>okay,</v>

1000
01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.010
<v 1>and I'm sure you can crawl under a truck and modify it.</v>

1001
01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:19.040
I'm not saying you straight across the board dumb,
but to not,

1002
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:23.860
not to understand money.
It's,
I swear to God,

1003
01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:26.920
dude is one of the dumbest things you honestly,
and this is for everybody,

1004
01:04:26.921 --> 01:04:31.921
it's one of the dumbest things you could ever do in life is I understand not

1005
01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:36.880
understanding money up to about 1819 but once you're to the point where you can

1006
01:04:36.881 --> 01:04:41.110
go to a library,
we can go on the Internet and you can just just read up on it,

1007
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.283
<v 2>okay?</v>

1008
01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:45.240
<v 1>If you don't understand money,</v>

1009
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:49.080
you're going to be behind the eight ball for your entire fucking life and you're

1010
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:53.130
basically going to be an indentured servant to credit card companies and banks

1011
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:57.420
and your life is going to suck way more than it needs to.
Okay?

1012
01:04:57.450 --> 01:05:00.120
I'm not saying that just because you understand money.

1013
01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:02.100
One are your kidneys isn't going to shit the bed.

1014
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.140
Bad Shit's already going to happen.

1015
01:05:04.141 --> 01:05:07.230
You don't need to compound it with not understanding money.

1016
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1017
01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:09.243
<v 1>All right.</v>

1018
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1019
01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:13.250
<v 1>This woman is the best thing that ever fucking happen to you.</v>

1020
01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:17.200
You don't understand money and you want monitored for drinks and some extra

1021
01:05:17.201 --> 01:05:19.440
curriculars.
What does that mean?
An eight ball.

1022
01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:20.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1023
01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.010
<v 1>If you start with drinks and then you say,</v>

1024
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.040
I like how safe for drinks or some extra curriculars like boozing to you isn't

1025
01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:32.670
even an extracurricular activity.
That's just,
you know,

1026
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.120
<v 2>okay,</v>

1027
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.830
<v 1>let's like nourishment for you.
So I'm,</v>

1028
01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:40.780
I'm assuming that extra curriculars is at least a bag of weed or maybe some

1029
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:45.220
condoms to bag some trucker whore.
Truckstop whore,
you know?

1030
01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.880
Listen sir,
you got a great fucking woman,

1031
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:53.910
but she's only gonna put up with you not understanding money for so long because

1032
01:05:54.441 --> 01:05:59.350
at some date points she's going to want a god damn man.
Okay.

1033
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:01.750
Especially once you have a couple of kids,

1034
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.910
she doesn't need you being some adult kids.

1035
01:06:03.911 --> 01:06:08.911
So I would say read up on money and you'd understand what a favor she's doing

1036
01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:11.680
for you.
If you,
if your bank balance is going up,

1037
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:14.920
you're doing better than 90% of the people out there.
All right?

1038
01:06:14.921 --> 01:06:15.671
So here's a good thing.

1039
01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:20.320
You got to fucking angel and she's smart and just read up on money.

1040
01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:23.740
All right?
She's also keeping in shape.
Go buy groceries.

1041
01:06:23.741 --> 01:06:25.000
Don't become a tub of shit.

1042
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:26.290
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1043
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:29.540
<v 1>You know,
she's basically without you even realizing,
or possibly even her,</v>

1044
01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:30.940
she's laying down the gauntlet here.

1045
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:34.720
She's basically saying in her own cute way.

1046
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:38.380
I don't want to be married to some fat broke trucker.
All right?

1047
01:06:38.381 --> 01:06:39.430
So read up on money.

1048
01:06:39.431 --> 01:06:44.140
Keep eating your fucking pears and fruit out there and a,
and you'll be fine.

1049
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.753
<v 0>Alrighty.</v>

1050
01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.433
With

1051
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.770
their eyes.

1052
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.480
[inaudible].
