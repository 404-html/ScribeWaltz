1
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.740
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.741 --> 00:00:06.700
It's bill burr and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.250
uh,
November 12th.

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.460
I'm all Billy freckle face is off the road for the first time in a awhile.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.400
First time in a while.
And I have to tell you,

6
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:23.290
I don't know what to do with myself.
It's phenomenal.
I wake up on my own bed,

7
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.240
you know,
although I do feel estranged from the lovely Nia,

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.780
you know,
we haven't seen much of each other.
I'm just kidding.

9
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.060
That word has never used.
It's always used when,
um,

10
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.090
a couple breaks up.
It's strange,
you know,

11
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.380
like you're never a strange from a family pet.
Right.

12
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.160
Do they ever say that on the news?
Mel Gibson and his,

13
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:53.620
his strange Dalmatian we're seeing,
trying to reconcile,

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.410
um,
you don't,
don't Ya,

15
00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.421
you don't bill.

16
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.690
You could always just look words up and just figure out what they mean rather

17
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:05.330
than just trying to figure him out how people use them.

18
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.830
Do you really how many words there are in the English language that,
um,

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.390
I know how to use them,
but I could not give you a definition.

20
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.300
I just keep hearing people say him.
You know,

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.680
like when you listen to some dude from the fucking hood back in the day,

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.850
first time you heard that's dope.
And you're like,
that's dope.

23
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.420
He's a dope for that.
He's saying it's stupid.

24
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.140
I,
you know,
and then you just gradually fig.
Oh,
it means something good.

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.880
Why do they do that?
Why do they make it mean the exact opposite?

26
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.630
Why is this some sort of passive aggressive way to frustrate white people

27
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:47.100
because of all the bullshit we've done to them.
Oh Geez.
I don't know.

28
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.070
And you go back over to your white friends

29
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.320
with the words make sense to you,
you know?
Um,
anyways,

30
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.700
this is the Monday morning podcast with a fucked in my dog.

31
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.600
Go Cleo,
Cleo.

32
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.530
There you are.
Start.
You start looking at do you figured out how to open a door?

33
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.030
That would be a problem.

34
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.690
Now that I've called you and you think I'm going to give me attention,
beat it.

35
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.820
All right,
thanks for the kiss.
Okay.
Anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

36
00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:22.150
If I haven't said it 87 fucking times yet.

37
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.120
As promised last week,
I said,
you know what,

38
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.720
I'm going to do Ari Shaffir skeptic tank.
And you know what,

39
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:33.460
I'm a man of my word even though I still can't pronounce that skeptic tank.
Um,

40
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:35.200
I did it at the comedy store.
It was great.

41
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:38.740
We did it right out there on the patio and a,

42
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.570
there's a bunch of tour buses keep coming up.

43
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:44.080
So if we keep getting interrupted by the public and I've got to tell you,

44
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.610
like nine tour buses came up full of tourists.

45
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.900
Not One of them recognized me.
And I'm going to tell you it bruise my ego.

46
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.880
You know why?
Let's funny,
but I'm dead serious.
I was,

47
00:02:57.881 --> 00:02:59.110
I wanted that moment.

48
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.280
<v 3>Well,
Hey,
that's that guy from the thing.
I really like what you do.</v>

49
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.660
I wanted that to happen.

50
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.850
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.250
<v 2>I'm not ashamed of that.
Why the fuck you take?
I've got in this business.</v>

52
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.790
Why do you think I get on the God damn stage and dance like a fucking monkey

53
00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:14.624
every night?

54
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.603
<v 4>Okay.</v>

55
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.100
<v 2>Cause I want to improve your day.
No,
it's all about me.</v>

56
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.440
All about me and my credits.
Um,
anyways,

57
00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:28.190
what a week Han people,
what a week of fucking stress.

58
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.980
My apologies to everybody out there in the red states.
I know you wanted a,
uh,

59
00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:38.090
what the fuck is his name?
Mitt Romney.
His real name.
Willard Willard Mitt Romney.

60
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.080
<v 4>Okay.</v>

61
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.360
<v 2>To get pilot Ford</v>

62
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.100
from some white land you'll never heard of.

63
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.430
I'm a 26 Willa

64
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.743
<v 3>raw.</v>

65
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.850
<v 2>Um,
you know what actually saw something with uh,</v>

66
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.560
Lord of the rings.
Actually watched a little bit of that shit.

67
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.460
I watched it for I think about 20 seconds.

68
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.120
It was the white hair dude with the guy.

69
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.490
Looks like Ricky Schroder if Ricky Schroeder got fucked by Spock.

70
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.263
<v 4>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.320
<v 2>Oh sorry.
I liked that one.
Um,</v>

72
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.450
and I was standing there and the courses are some broad there who like you're

73
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.190
supposed to respect but for,
for no fucking reason at all.

74
00:04:31.191 --> 00:04:34.310
She's showing way too much skin.
You know,

75
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.210
just everybody in like middle earth in like in the future.

76
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.860
And in the past they all have fucking bikinis on with like a sword or some sort

77
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:46.250
of knife.
When can that ever be in the presence?

78
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.890
That's what they should do.
That's what you bitch,

79
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:53.940
you should be doing when you go down to the beach with your little skimpy outfit

80
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:56.670
on,
you should have a nice fucking,
uh,
Daniel Boone knife

81
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.750
<v 4>in there.
And then</v>

82
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.940
<v 2>all the fucking,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
I don't want to say players,</v>

83
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:06.430
but I don't know what else to say that guys who know how to talk to fucking

84
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.540
women,
I'll leave you alone because they see the knife,
but there's a price.

85
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.530
There's always a price to pay.

86
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:16.531
You'll have a bunch of fucking nerds following you cause they'll think you're a

87
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.110
f.
Don't know why the word Willow's coming into my head is that one of those

88
00:05:21.111 --> 00:05:21.944
references.

89
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.030
<v 4>Okay.</v>

90
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.271
<v 2>You know,</v>

91
00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:26.960
I found out the other day that led Zeppelin was really into Lord of the rings.

92
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.200
I didn't realize that when they was singing about all that shit.

93
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.870
Cause in the doc is depth of mortar.

94
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.490
Is that from fucking a Lord of the rings?
You know,
I bet it's a wonderful book.

95
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.240
<v 4>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.060
<v 2>You know,
it's just that you got to sit down and read all three of them.</v>

97
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.680
Oh my God,
what's going to happen next?
Or they're going to,
I think,

98
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.490
going to get up to the surface or they're going to go down towards the,

99
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.980
the heated core of the earth,
middle earth.

100
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.460
And what is a fucking son down there that a nerd realize

101
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.080
<v 1>even nerd should know that.
Right.
Anyway,</v>

102
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.170
so I'm watching this shit for like 20 seconds.
I'm like,

103
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:07.190
I'm going to give it a shot here.

104
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.533
<v 0>I'm going to try,</v>

105
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.760
<v 1>you know,
or at the very least get a couple more references for my podcast.</v>

106
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:15.710
And I'm sitting there,
right?
And the old,

107
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.880
the Obi wan Kenobi looking guy talking to a Ricky Schroder who got fucked by

108
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.570
Spock and the lady with their fucking Bikinian or knife.

109
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.710
I didn't know if she had that.

110
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.820
I'm probably thinking of Princess Leia when she was next to that fat fucking

111
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.650
toad when Boba Fett got killed.
Right.

112
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.263
<v 0>And,
um,</v>

113
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.540
<v 1>all of a sudden there's white horse comes in,</v>

114
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.970
all white horse comes in and uh,

115
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.400
and the Ricky Schroder who got fucked by Spock is like,
I dunno what he said.

116
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.600
What is up with that if I don't know what he said and the fucking Obi wan Kenobi

117
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:55.130
guy goes,
oh,
that's so and so the Lord of all horses.

118
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.073
<v 0>Huh?</v>

119
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.810
<v 1>It was,
how do you watch pass that line?</v>

120
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.410
Is that really the Lord of all horses?

121
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:11.860
You fucking senile old coot the fuck is wrong with you.

122
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.500
And not to mention subtly racist.

123
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.460
Why is the Lord of all horses is widest fucking chuck?

124
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.760
Huh?
Coming up with good hair.
Main just flowing.

125
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.710
How come,
how come I couldn't bend my like one of those Arabian horses,
you know,

126
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:34.330
jet black with the sun shining off the side,
seeing all the muscles,

127
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.340
you know.
Hey,
you here to hear first?
I think that the fucking,

128
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.110
I think it's a little racist.

129
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

130
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.270
<v 1>Why isn't all white horse the Lord of all horses</v>

131
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.800
isn't racist to do that?
Or are other horses and like ponies,

132
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.680
you know,
horses and ponies and never get along black horses.
We'd make it fun.

133
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:00.140
The point with the ponies isn't a motherfucker.

134
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.050
Oh Jesus.
Um,
anyways,

135
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.830
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
I just thought it was ridiculous.

136
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:16.280
The Lord of all horses and you're sitting there eat your popcorn and your

137
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:19.700
fucking racist pcs.
Just eating that shit up.
You know,

138
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.210
I saw a couple of,
I actually saw a couple and went out and I saw,

139
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.630
I saw that.
And um,
I liked it,

140
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:33.170
but it was funny when Ben Affleck,
they say,
what's your name?
And he goes,

141
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:38.000
my name is Tony Mendez.
I remember thinking in my head going,

142
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:41.510
Mendez,
I think that's a Latino name.

143
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.230
I know it's not a white name.
I know.
I've never met anybody.

144
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.150
I never met a white guy.
Hey,
what's your name?
Ah,
Larry.
Larry.
What?

145
00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:55.800
Rodriguez.
Larry Mendez.
It's not,
you know,

146
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.950
it's not like one of those crossover names.
So in the end of the movie,

147
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.930
spoiler alert,
they had,
this is just shit in the credits.

148
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.720
They just have a,
you know,
they have a picture of everybody,

149
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.500
you know,
each cast,
cause this was a true story.
So each cast member

150
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.120
is,
um,
you know,
I should talk to this,
I should talk to Neil about this.

151
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.070
You know what that's is,
this is it.
We're going to do a fucking,
uh,

152
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.160
another Nia log this week,
and I'm going to talk about this because they had,

153
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.690
you know,
the six actors who are fucking unreal,
who played the,
uh,

154
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.350
the people trying to get out of Iran.

155
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.210
They showed a closeup picture of the actor right next to a closeup picture of

156
00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:41.530
like the photo id of the person that they were playing and it was fucking dead

157
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:41.830
on.

158
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.440
They looked exactly like the person and then there's like another minute or so

159
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.730
credits.
And then they finally showed the real Tony Mendez.

160
00:09:48.731 --> 00:09:53.500
And the picture is like a full body shot of the guy from like halfway across the

161
00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:55.330
room shaking hands with Jimmy Carter.

162
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.710
And you're looking at the guy and he looks like Bartolo Colognes,

163
00:09:59.711 --> 00:10:04.510
dad and me.
And Nia just started laughing our asses off.

164
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.740
And you know,
it was,
it was one of those moments,
one of those Hollywood moments.

165
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.640
And then I looked on the internet and there was people complaining going,

166
00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:17.370
what the fuck?
You know,
how come you couldn't get a Latin actor to do it?
But bup,

167
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:20.950
bup,
bup,
booed,
the,
the and all that shit.
You know?

168
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.240
And this is what I got to say about that.
I definitely think it's fucked up.

169
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.560
Why don't I just say what I had to set about to say about that?
Like,
like what?

170
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:35.870
I was just going to present all this shit and then move on.
All right.

171
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.780
I don't know how to say my points without having some sort of intro.

172
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.000
And now here is what I think about that.

173
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.970
I think it's fucked up cause it was a real dude and he's a hero.

174
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.130
He did some unreal shit.

175
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.570
So because it's a real dude who did some real heroic shit,

176
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.280
you should have a lat dude
play the guy.

177
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.900
So everybody knows that that win is in their column.
You know,

178
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:06.270
that's one full Latinos,
you know,

179
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:10.050
so the next time you get into a bar room argument,
you know,

180
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.610
well don't,
and fed of the airplane and then the Latin guy could be like,

181
00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:16.180
yeah,

182
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.480
well we're the ones who got those six motherfuckers on the play and got them

183
00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:23.910
into Canada.
Right.
And all of your shit.

184
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.080
Both sides.
You were in a bar,
so none of your red.
It's all based on the movies.

185
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.150
But now it's going to cause a fight in a bar because some of them,

186
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.330
it was a white guy.

187
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.760
The guy's to know who's fucking Tony men days and say fuck you and why was it

188
00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:46.170
played by Ben Affleck?
And then there's going to be a big fight.

189
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.220
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

190
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.220
<v 1>But on the other side is if you got a fucking million dollars and you,</v>

191
00:11:53.311 --> 00:11:56.770
you need the movie to sell,
what do you do?

192
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.800
I still think they should at,
they should have gone.

193
00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:02.370
Well they should've got Luis Guzman.

194
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.583
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

195
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.200
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
The wheeze.
Guzman is Tony Mendez.</v>

196
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.750
I know.
Fucking nothing.
You know what?

197
00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:14.060
That's one of the ones I've got to talk to me about that shit.
But it's,

198
00:12:14.061 --> 00:12:16.880
it's a good movie.
You should definitely go see it.
But I've got to tell you,

199
00:12:16.881 --> 00:12:20.440
that was inadvertently fucking hilarious.
Um,

200
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.130
like me and Nia walked out and started joking about it and by the time we got

201
00:12:25.131 --> 00:12:29.900
out of the movie theater,
we were crying,
laughing,
and everybody

202
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.840
was looking at us like we were out of our minds.
We went to this one of those.

203
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.290
We want you to one of those fucking malls.
I hate going to,
you know,

204
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:41.410
those new malls that they make when they try to make it look like this little

205
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:45.700
city where there's no crime and everybody gets along.
You know,

206
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:47.550
I don't just mean like a mall.
We got,
you know,

207
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.150
the big anchor stores and then they put a fucking bunch of shit in the middle of

208
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:52.241
it.

209
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:57.241
I mean what it's like outside and they have like a trolley and a water fountain

210
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.990
and it plain like big band music,
you know,
like that,
that,

211
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:06.760
that Frank Sinatra music and Tony Bennett music that makes you feel successful.

212
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:08.230
Even if you're failing,
you know,

213
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:12.100
you're just walking around just buying a bunch of shit you don't even fucking

214
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:15.030
need.
Yeah.
You know,

215
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.520
but it all feels right because Tony Bennett's in the background,

216
00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:19.980
if I ruled the world

217
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.420
<v 3>every day would be the first day of Spring</v>

218
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.650
<v 1>and you'll fucking walking in and out of like lucky jeans,</v>

219
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.760
<v 0>you know,
what are you doing?</v>

220
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.430
<v 1>What are you doing?</v>

221
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.580
They're building the big fucking house for the fake guy to sit in there and for

222
00:13:38.581 --> 00:13:41.970
you to put your fucking kid on his lap.
Right?
Oh,

223
00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:45.360
maybe the talking bunny that time a year.

224
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:46.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.760
<v 1>There's a big fountain and it fucking shoots off water right to the music.</v>

226
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.450
You know what I mean?

227
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.980
There's everything other than like animals that don't get along with each other

228
00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:02.880
playing,
you know,
like they always did that.
And like the fucking Disney movies,

229
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.920
they start rolling around each other.

230
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.850
Ghetto doing somersaults with leaves and butterflies and everybody was like

231
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:11.280
giggling and laughing.
Just having a great fucking time.

232
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.810
Like that's what nature is.

233
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.463
<v 0>You know</v>

234
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.560
<v 1>it isn't,
it's like one of those fucking prison shows lockdown.</v>

235
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.900
Something's getting shanked.
So he's getting killed every fucking day out there.

236
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.170
You have a wonder that,
why don't they ever pop?
Why not?

237
00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:32.070
Why don't they ever post the murder rates out in the woods?
You know why?

238
00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:34.980
Cause it'd be off the charts and there's nothing you can fucking do about it.

239
00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:36.630
That's why there's no mayor in the woods,

240
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.623
<v 0>you know?</v>

241
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.800
<v 1>Can't help it.
You just let the,
that you just let people sort it out.</v>

242
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.920
That right there,
you look at the fucking,
not the woods.
The wilderness.
All right,

243
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:50.620
let's take it up a notch.
The woods,
that's like high school level football.

244
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:55.550
This is the,
all right,
that's how it goes.
You've got the woods wooded area,

245
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.120
right?
Then you have like a,

246
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.710
a parcel of land that's like the college level,
Division One,

247
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.140
and then the wilderness.
That's the fucking pros.

248
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.593
<v 0>You know,</v>

249
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.700
<v 1>no society,
there's no fucking rules.</v>

250
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.810
Anybody can blow anybody way.
That's how that works.

251
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.740
There's no trials.

252
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.053
<v 0>No</v>

253
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.691
<v 1>like that shit.</v>

254
00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:27.660
All those people went through out there in Jersey and still going through with

255
00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:32.100
that fucking hurricane,
that fucking New Jersey became the wilderness.

256
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.020
You know,
a couple of days.
Everybody's nice.
Hey,
I like your gas.
Can,

257
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.570
is yours empty too?
Right?

258
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.530
Fucking three days in four days then forget it.

259
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:50.250
But he starts getting that coyote look in their eye.
It's over fucking over.

260
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.650
You know,
I swear to God,

261
00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.740
I sat here in my house watching some of that shit,

262
00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.281
thinking,

263
00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:03.360
what the fuck am I going to do when it inevitably some giant earthquake out here

264
00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:06.570
in Los Angeles hits and we're just up to our fucking armpits.

265
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.063
What am I going to do?

266
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.773
<v 0>You know,</v>

267
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.220
<v 1>I started thinking about all the people came to my door during Halloween,</v>

268
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.280
you know,
and they got their little mass on and stuff.

269
00:16:18.281 --> 00:16:21.880
They're all giggling and happy and that type of shit and they got their parents

270
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:24.420
kind of in the background,
you know?
You know what,

271
00:16:24.421 --> 00:16:27.550
I realized those fuckers are coming back this time.

272
00:16:27.551 --> 00:16:29.170
They're wearing masks for different reasons

273
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.040
and they ain't got

274
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.150
no seriously,
what the fuck am I going to do?
So I started watching that show.

275
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:43.760
You know what the,

276
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.760
those people who are prepping for dooms day and you're supposed to watch that

277
00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:51.940
show and I guess laugh at these people on some level.

278
00:16:51.941 --> 00:16:56.440
And I had to shut it off after 15 minutes and I was just like,

279
00:16:56.441 --> 00:17:01.390
this guy is right.
This guy is smart.
What he's doing is smart.

280
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.050
It's smart to prepare for dooms day,
not even dooms day,

281
00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:09.550
just do something fucked up to happen because there's too many people.

282
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.260
And uh,

283
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:16.261
I think it's dumb to basically just be fucking sitting here and you're your,

284
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.670
your whole game plan is,
um,
I'm all good.

285
00:17:21.671 --> 00:17:26.310
If it's all good.
Hey,
what if chaos happens?

286
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.910
Well then I guess I'm fucked.
That's what I've learned.

287
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.020
So I'm sitting here and I'm watching these guys in that they're building these,

288
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.680
these things in the ground and uh,
you know,

289
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.800
whether you can stick food and all this type of shit or survive stuff.

290
00:17:40.801 --> 00:17:44.730
And all that.
And I don't have the space for that.
I can't do it.

291
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:49.970
So all I can do is go out and I'm going to get two guns,

292
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.500
<v 2>one for those fucking cunts coming up the walk,
and then my safety,</v>

293
00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.900
my backup gun,
the one when all hope is lost and I eat that last fruit loop.

294
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:02.010
I just put it to my head,

295
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.893
<v 0>you know,</v>

296
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.500
<v 2>I would be ready.
There's no fee,
you know,</v>

297
00:18:11.501 --> 00:18:14.530
I'm too fucking old to learn.

298
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:15.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

299
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.110
<v 2>Green Baret Jujitsu,</v>

300
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.460
how to grow fucking plants.
And I've just,
I'm just too fucking old.

301
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.820
I'm too set in my God damn waste.
All right.
I like,
I like,
you know,

302
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.030
I'm one of those guys,
I don't wait for the sales.
You know what I mean?

303
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.030
That's my mentality.
I need a coat.
I just go out and I go fucking buy one.

304
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.230
All right,
I'm going quick here.
I'm getting a gun and I'm shooting at,

305
00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:39.050
people will come in at me and when I get down to my last bullet,

306
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.640
I'm a fucking idiot.
Why don't I just have one gun,
save some extra money.

307
00:18:43.641 --> 00:18:45.920
Just have one gun.
You get down to the last because I'll fuck it up.

308
00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:49.160
That's why click,
click,
click,
click,
click.
And then I had nothing left.

309
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.470
And then when the zombies are coming in and what am I doing?

310
00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:53.420
Just start smashing myself in the head with it.

311
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:55.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

312
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.360
<v 2>Oh,
this podcast.
It's always so uplifting,
isn't it?
Um,
so anyways,</v>

313
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.740
and what's that?
Let's do a little advertising here on the,
uh,

314
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.990
the Monday morning podcast would have fuckers.
Um,
all right,

315
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.540
here we go.
stamps.com everybody.
All right.

316
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:15.810
Some small companies think some small companies think that leasing,

317
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.610
leasing a postage meter is how business gets Po.
What is,

318
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:23.700
how business get postage for their letters and packages.

319
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.870
Oh,
businesses,
why don't I just wing this?
Because when I try and read the copy,

320
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.440
it makes them sound dumb.
They wrote that sentence correctly by the way.

321
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.950
Said some small companies that think leasing a postage meter.

322
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.830
<v 0>Okay?</v>

323
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.800
<v 2>He's how businesses get postage for their letters and packages.</v>

324
00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.910
That isn't how they do it,
but they don't realize that there's a better way.

325
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.100

Did you guys watch sports this weekend?

343
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.790
Oh,
are you reading about the Lord,
the Lord of all horses?

344
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.720
Um,
wider than an albino?

345
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.840
Would you get an all white horse?
First of all?
It wouldn't be all white.

346
00:21:06.841 --> 00:21:09.990
It would smell like fucking shit after awhile.
It just,

347
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.320
it'd be like having a white coat.
You know,
you can't,

348
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.790
you can't lean up against anything,

349
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.823
<v 0>you know,</v>

350
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.550
<v 2>you know,
p did,
he always has those all white parties.</v>

351
00:21:19.551 --> 00:21:21.200
But what they never do is they never show the,
the,

352
00:21:21.201 --> 00:21:23.510
the patrons at the end of the night,
you know,

353
00:21:23.511 --> 00:21:27.400
with the fucking red wine spills all over him and God knows what are,

354
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.140
where are the fucking heathenistic shit happens on those parties.

355
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:33.703
Um,

356
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.540
does he still have those that I just make a fucking reference to something from

357
00:21:36.541 --> 00:21:40.740
10 years ago.
Um,
anyways,

358
00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:42.450
you guys watch the watch the election.

359
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.530
I didn't want you any of it and I was actually terrified of the results.

360
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.433
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

361
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.380
<v 2>I didn't like either one of those guys.</v>

362
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.250
And each one of them had some shit that I was afraid if they got elected was

363
00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:59.810
going to happen.
Um,
I line up with a lot of Republicans.
Shit,

364
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.750
surprise,
surprise.
But,
uh,
I can't,
you know,

365
00:22:02.751 --> 00:22:05.480
if they would just drop that and if somebody is a,

366
00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:09.230
which we should be allowed to stone them,
you know,

367
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.380
those guys really got a fucking,
you know,

368
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.490
and being gay is a choice.
Like that shit.

369
00:22:16.491 --> 00:22:20.870
It's just in the world's flat and then the sun goes around the earth.

370
00:22:20.871 --> 00:22:24.800
Like that shit.
It's,
I mean,
how many votes,

371
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:30.130
how many votes would they fucking lose if they dropped those?

372
00:22:30.171 --> 00:22:31.610
Jesus freaks,
psychos.

373
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.183
<v 0>You know?</v>

374
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.020
<v 2>It's one of those things where sometimes it's almost like rebuilding a team</v>

375
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:39.980
where sometimes you just got to take a step back,

376
00:22:39.981 --> 00:22:44.340
which you just got to get rid of that old guy,
you know,
and move in,

377
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.030
move in with some new shit and just,

378
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.510
just wait patiently for that person to start to learn the game.

379
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.230
You know?
I don't fucking know.

380
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.430
I know because at the end of the day,
whether you elect the Democratic Guy,

381
00:22:58.431 --> 00:22:59.420
the Republican guy,

382
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.960
those fucking consists still going to saw the tops off of the mountains.

383
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.210
You know they're going to still dump shit in the ocean and it there's that.

384
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.480
The banks are still going to do what they do.
You know,

385
00:23:11.481 --> 00:23:15.110
I talked to a guy yesterday who used to work for Goldman Sachs as a waiter.

386
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.520
I'm like,
what do you mean as a fucking waiter?
He used to work at the top floor.

387
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.840
This is how bankers are limit.
He said up at the top floor,
these guys,

388
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.080
they had the best China,
the best silverware,

389
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.500
these bankers everyday for fucking lunch and they would just have these insane

390
00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:36.501
meals and on the walls they had like Rembrandt's just for their own enjoyment

391
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.030
and this is a great thing.

392
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:44.060
That's all our money that we go down there and give to those cuts.

393
00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.090
Begging

394
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.630
<v 1>is,
it's the most evil fucking thing I think,</v>

395
00:23:49.631 --> 00:23:54.631
on the planet due to my limited knowledge and how some guy just told me he was a

396
00:23:55.261 --> 00:23:58.140
waiter at Goldman Sachs and he seemed to have all the details.

397
00:23:58.141 --> 00:24:02.130
I took everything that he had to say at a 100% face value.

398
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.563
<v 0>MMM.</v>

399
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.030
<v 2>Yeah.
It's just,
it's,
you know,</v>

400
00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.110
<v 1>I don't fucking,
you know,
something.</v>

401
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.820
The amount of times I opened my mouth and by the time I realize what I'm talking

402
00:24:14.821 --> 00:24:18.570
about,
I'm just so far over my head.
It's ridiculous.

403
00:24:18.571 --> 00:24:21.900
Let's get back into my wheel house.
Did you guys watch any football yesterday?

404
00:24:21.901 --> 00:24:23.430
He watched the football.
Hey,

405
00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:28.140
how bout how bout Texas a and m beaten Alabama.
Ah,

406
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.210
I was a week early

407
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.643
<v 0>Alabama.</v>

408
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:37.100
<v 1>The dream is over of the treatments tonight between meds tonight.</v>

409
00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.380
<v 2>And you know why you're probably sitting there.</v>

410
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.110
Has anybody seen this kid had Johnny Manziel?
Huh?

411
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:46.560
Johnny football is their calling him.
It's fucking guys unreal.

412
00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.390
He's running around like Mike Vick.
Eni,
Eni can throw the ball on the run.

413
00:24:51.391 --> 00:24:53.490
He can stay in the pocket.
The kits is freshmen.

414
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.390
I hope he doesn't get hurt the way he's running around like he does.

415
00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.060
He's going to get killed in the NFL if he tries to do that.

416
00:25:00.061 --> 00:25:03.660
But he's only a freshman and it seems like he can stand in the pocket.
Granted,

417
00:25:03.661 --> 00:25:07.320
I have not watched one fucking game that he's played.

418
00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:10.560
I've just watched his highlight reel,
which is the youtube video of the week.

419
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:15.730
Texas a and M Johnny Manziel.
I hope I'm saying his name right.
No disrespect.
Um,

420
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.020
his highlights.
You got to watch this guy and uh,

421
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.340
if you don't watch college football and you want to jump in some point,

422
00:25:23.341 --> 00:25:27.450
this would be a great guy to watch as you watch him through his career.

423
00:25:27.451 --> 00:25:30.450
Hopefully he'll play at least three years,
but if he keeps doing what he's doing,

424
00:25:30.451 --> 00:25:34.530
he's probably gonna bail after his junior year.
Right.
Sophomore,

425
00:25:34.531 --> 00:25:37.940
juniors and then what the kids do nowadays.
Um,

426
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.200
and they lost and I was too busy freaking out.

427
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.320
I was actually an artist actually doing,
I was trying to do some,
uh,

428
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.250
boyfriend girlfriend should here because I'd been on the road so much.

429
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.620
<v 1>So on Saturday,
say they say in Boston,</v>

430
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:59.621
come on over on Sag Friday or say um,

431
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.430
the hell did we do,
we went out

432
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.850
to this Asian cuisine place cause she's freaking out.

433
00:26:09.851 --> 00:26:13.780
Cause they had these ramen noodles and not the broken wall broke,
broke ass shit.

434
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.780
Like the real,
the real shit,
you know,

435
00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.470
from like behind the wall of China I believe is where they come from.

436
00:26:20.471 --> 00:26:23.590
I don't fucking know.
And uh,
I go there.
I'm not a big noodle sky,

437
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.440
you know what I mean?

438
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.620
I don't like slurping that soup with all those fucking noodles.
I always,
I just,

439
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.300
you know,
if it's raining out,
you know,
I'm kind of a soup guy I guess.

440
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.030
<v 4>Okay.</v>

441
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.840
<v 1>I just,
I just don't like it,
but she wants to go try to hear that.
Good.</v>

442
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.010
All right,
let's go.
So we went there.
It was actually,
it was decent.
You know,

443
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.000
I got pork in mine.
You should have seen this slab of pork.
I swear to God,

444
00:26:49.001 --> 00:26:52.510
if I have a heart attack instead of my life flashing before my eyes is going to

445
00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:55.180
be that piece of pork gone.
That's what it was.

446
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.790
And then I'm going to fucking land face down.

447
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:03.130
Am I spaghettios like that fat fucking seven.
Right.
Um,

448
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:09.190
so we did that and then we went over and we saw Argo and a,
and I figured,

449
00:27:09.191 --> 00:27:12.640
you know,
I figured I was done for the night,
for the day.
I figured I was done.

450
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:14.120
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

451
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.790
<v 1>And then she mentions to me that,
uh,
you know,</v>

452
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.470
somebody she know is having a,
a,
a house warming party.

453
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.560
Do you want to go to that?
And I was like,
no,
no,
I don't.
I have no desire.

454
00:27:27.561 --> 00:27:28.690
Why would I want to go there?

455
00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.760
And then I just saw the look on her face and I was like,
all right,
I'll go,

456
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.620
I'll go at a,
I went down there.
I actually had a great time,

457
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.900
actually had a great fucking time,
but it's,
you know,

458
00:27:38.901 --> 00:27:42.280
when you go to a house warming party though,
you know,
it just,
I dunno,

459
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.680
you fucking go there and you're like,
Oh wow,
they have one of those.

460
00:27:45.681 --> 00:27:49.460
We should get one of those.
How do you,
how come we don't have one of those?

461
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.370
The ends up just costing your money.

462
00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:52.810
<v 4>Okay.</v>

463
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.660
<v 1>You know,
so I would recommend,
because the place we went,</v>

464
00:27:55.661 --> 00:27:56.920
they had a really nice house.

465
00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.700
If you agree as a guy to go to a house warming party,

466
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.950
only go if you know your house is better because if you don't,

467
00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.540
you girls get to see some shit.
Oh,

468
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:11.080
you're going to see some shit and you got to want it and next thing you know

469
00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:13.300
you're going to fucking,
you're gonna,
you're gonna want to buy it,

470
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.743
<v 4>you know?</v>

471
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.150
<v 1>I don't know.
Somebody already gave me shit came into my house was so like,
dude,</v>

472
00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:22.490
what are you going to like officially move into your house?
I'm like,

473
00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:24.830
I am in my house.
You know,

474
00:28:24.831 --> 00:28:29.590
when he kind of made a couple more fucking comments and uh,
I don't know,

475
00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:32.680
I guess what you supposed to buy the house and rather than pay down the
mortgage,

476
00:28:32.681 --> 00:28:35.980
you supposed to buy a bunch of shiny shit like every other fucking hands on the

477
00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:40.810
block,
you know?
Yeah.
I don't have a,

478
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:45.080
I sorta have a dining room table and yet we don't have any chairs.
Shit.

479
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.213
<v 4>All right,</v>

480
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.330
<v 1>I'll buy,
I'll buy the fucking chairs.
When,
when?</v>

481
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.550
When I got the,
the,
the,

482
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.880
the principle down to a point where I can fucking relax at night.

483
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.050
That's how I do it.
I get to fucking house,

484
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.490
I keep my air mattress or whatever the fuck I buy and I just pay the thing off

485
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.340
and then once I pay it off,
Dan,
you buy the chairs?

486
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.620
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

487
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.160
<v 1>That all we want another TV.
Then you get the other fucking TV.</v>

488
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.560
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

489
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.910
<v 1>These fucking assholes lighten up their credit cards and paying all the fucking</v>

490
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.753
interesting.

491
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.870
They're at the top there were at the top of the building with the finest China,

492
00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.340
with rem breads on the wall.
And you know why that is?

493
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.380
You know why that is?

494
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.030
<v 4>Okay.</v>

495
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:40.070
<v 1>I don't know.
I mean a whiteness,
I had to say,
you know why that is twice?</v>

496
00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:42.970
Because I actually don't even know why it is.
Okay,

497
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:47.380
but I'm going to try and buy as few paintings on that fucking wall is humanly

498
00:29:47.381 --> 00:29:49.750
possible.
I'm going to pay these conch back.

499
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.260
You think I'm fucking sitting here on the hook for 30 goddamn years.

500
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.650
You're crazy.
All right.
And I buy,

501
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.500
I have to have a dining room table with no fucking chairs.

502
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.600
If that's the price I have to pay.

503
00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:03.450
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

504
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.550
<v 1>well they got damn.
And I'm doing it all right.
That's what I say.</v>

505
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.230
And he go fuck yourself.
If you don't like it,

506
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.560
you know you want to come over for Thanksgiving?
Come on over.
All right.

507
00:30:11.561 --> 00:30:14.710
Where's some comfy shoes?
Cause you're going to be standing up with paper plates.

508
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.580
All right.
And when you give me that look,
I'll fucking break out my mortgage.

509
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.460
Then I'll fucking put her right in your face and show you a ha ha.

510
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.610
What percentage io?
How I'm not it down.

511
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.460
How I'm giving it a fucking liver punch every month.
That's what I'm doing.

512
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.240
All right.
Anyway,
so I'm just fucking with you guys.
Um,

513
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.830
I'm not actually the angers bullshit,
but the philosophy,

514
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.120
the philosophy is intact.
Um,
anyways,

515
00:30:43.121 --> 00:30:47.650
how about those New England patriots?
Half,
no old Gza.
Good Lord.

516
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:48.850
I swear to God,
if it wasn't,

517
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:53.910
if we didn't get 3000 yards in penalties in favor of us,

518
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.020
um,
I,
I'm going to say,
you know,

519
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.050
but you know something that bills didn't deserve the win that game anyways.

520
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.080
It's like they almost have like a fear of winning every time they were going to

521
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:04.240
win.
Oh my God,
we're going to score a touchdown.

522
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:08.470
Let's drop the ball on the one yard line.
Hey,
we're down by six.

523
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:11.650
If we score a touchdown here,
we'll actually win the game.

524
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.450
Dad Throw it to the other guy.

525
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.550
<v 4>Okay.</v>

526
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.440
<v 1>I swear to God this is,
you know,</v>

527
00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.940
this patriots team right now is like basically what I've been watching for the

528
00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:26.000
last four years where our record is way better than our team.

529
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:32.170
Like we have to score 35 to 38 points a game just for me to feel comfortable as

530
00:31:32.631 --> 00:31:35.780
a fan.
And then we let up like you know,

531
00:31:35.781 --> 00:31:39.110
anywhere from like 24 to 31 33 points,

532
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:40.820
but at the end of the year,

533
00:31:40.821 --> 00:31:45.821
somehow we're 11 and five 12 and four and 17 point favorites in the playoffs.

534
00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.960
And then when we lose people like that,
absolutely shocking.

535
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:55.970
It's like really,
what numbers are you looking at?
What Games are,

536
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.380
what games are you watching?

537
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.760
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

538
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.050
<v 1>I actually think our are,
I like our front for,</v>

539
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.080
and I don't mind our linebackers,
but our secondary is,
uh,

540
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:14.620
as my mom would say,
leave something to be desired.

541
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:16.623
Jesus Christ.

542
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:18.370
<v 4>Okay.</v>

543
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.370
<v 1>They make every fucking quarterback who comes in look like Joe Montana.</v>

544
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:23.980
We don't have one lights out guy.

545
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.480
Like even if the rules of coverage where the were the way they were before pate

546
00:32:29.901 --> 00:32:34.750
manning and the colts complained and spearheaded this movement now where if you

547
00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:35.050
even,

548
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:39.830
I mean how bad with where some of those pass interference calls last week or

549
00:32:39.831 --> 00:32:40.460
this past week?

550
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.370
<v 2>I should say that first one they called on the bills.</v>

551
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:46.970
They basically gave the Patriots and touch on the second one I guess you could

552
00:32:46.971 --> 00:32:50.450
say was passing interference cause he just impeded the guy as he was trying to

553
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:52.640
cut across the end zone.

554
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.490
But even that one back in the day was kind of iffy.

555
00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:58.390
And uh,
I dunno.

556
00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:00.130
<v 4>Okay.</v>

557
00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.780
<v 2>I don't like it.
I don't like it.</v>

558
00:33:01.781 --> 00:33:05.890
And I didn't like when we tackled their quarterback and it evidently it was our

559
00:33:05.891 --> 00:33:09.430
fault that he was so short that when our linebackers stood up,

560
00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.760
they went face mass to face mass,
you know,
and that,
that fucking Fitzpatrick,

561
00:33:12.761 --> 00:33:14.730
that look of anger he had on his face,
like

562
00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.580
<v 1>throw the flag,</v>

563
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.190
<v 2>you know,
the whole Brady rule,
you know,
I love,</v>

564
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:27.191
I love wow fucking dumb football fans are to where they actually blame Tom Brady

565
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:31.070
for that one.
That,
that's the NFL.
Okay.

566
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.400
Brady and his uggs makes the NFL a ton of fucking money and it,

567
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:40.940
and they lose a bunch of money if he's on the sideline.
Okay.

568
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.730
So that's basically straight across the board.

569
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:46.490
It wasn't good for the NFL last year when Peyton manning was out.

570
00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:49.910
It's not good when Brady's out.
It's not what good would drew Brees,
um,

571
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.680
Aaron Rodgers,
any of these guys are out.

572
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:56.000
So they're completely overprotecting them.
All right.
But it took Tom Brady,

573
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:59.300
Captain America to go down for them to realize it.
That's basically what it was.

574
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.400
That was the straw that broke the camel's back.

575
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:04.670
And if you can't want to blame him,
Huh?
Well you go ahead and blame him,

576
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.230
but I know the real,
it's a money.
It's a money decision.
That's what it is.

577
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.940
The whole fucking thing is all about,
you know what?

578
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.290
What do people who are casual fans of the NFL like they like or offense,

579
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:23.210
they like scoring every fucking rule.
All right,
I'm a broken record.

580
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:27.410
You know what I'm saying?
It's just another Sunday of just like,
I literally,

581
00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:31.700
at this point when I watch a game,
even if it's my team has the ball,

582
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.880
if I see a flag during a pass play,

583
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:39.950
I just immediately go on that fucking ball.
Shag

584
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.830
did.
People laughed.
They go,
you haven't even seen yet.
It's like,

585
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:46.440
I don't need to see it.
80% of them are complete horse shit.

586
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:52.230
<v 1>You see what I did there?
He was covering the receiver.
You,</v>

587
00:34:52.231 --> 00:34:56.070
you can't do that.
Can't do that.
He,
he reached,

588
00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.100
he his fingernail brushed the sleeve of the wide receiver right there.

589
00:35:02.191 --> 00:35:04.530
You can't do that.
After two and a half yards,

590
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:11.080
<v 2>um,
I had a fucking panic attack.</v>

591
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.260
The Lakers fired their coach,
Mike Brown.
And I loved Mike Brown.

592
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.920
I loved everything that he was doing for the Lakers.

593
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.190
<v 4>Okay.</v>

594
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.630
<v 2>I loved you guys all know.
I hate the Lakers.
I totally respect Colby Bryant.</v>

595
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:34.040
I respect the showtime Lakers.
I actually love all those players now.

596
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.710
Now that they're retired and everything and I watched the highlight,
I just,

597
00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.370
you know,
I can now just sit back

598
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.610
<v 1>and be like,
man,
those guys,
cause they could really play the game.</v>

599
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.450
And I love all the Laker fans that were there back in the day at the forum.

600
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.150
All right.
But this new shit,

601
00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.950
it's a different kind of hate.
Like I'm not gonna lie.

602
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:55.260
I hated the Lakers back in the day,
but um,

603
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.620
I hated the team and it was the same,

604
00:35:57.621 --> 00:36:00.110
basically the same team every year after year.
For the most part.

605
00:36:00.111 --> 00:36:03.500
That core group of guys was the same group of guys,
but this,
this fucking shit.

606
00:36:03.501 --> 00:36:06.290
Now,
you know,

607
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.250
with everybody just piling on like Dwight Howard,

608
00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:13.190
Dwight Howard blew up that team out there in Orlando.

609
00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:16.970
The guy was a fucking cancer.
He drove his fucking coach out of town.

610
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:22.400
They faced the Lakers in the finals.
He's posting up against like fucking,
uh,

611
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:27.700
Pau Gasol.
Oh,
was it buying them?
I don't fucking know.

612
00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:28.901
But you know,

613
00:36:28.901 --> 00:36:32.110
all of those guys should have been in foul trouble with how big the a body he

614
00:36:32.111 --> 00:36:35.830
was.
And he didn't do shit.
You didn't do shit.

615
00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.340
So now what does he do?
He joins the fucking Lakers.

616
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.990
He's dancing with Ellen and everybody's acting like this guys,

617
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:47.680
this fucking savior.
Right?
So they come in there,
they're not winning shit.

618
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:51.860
Blame it on Mike Brown.
He gets fucking bounced out.
What she should have,

619
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.440
they should have fired him after last year.

620
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.280
They should have fired him that time when Colby walked back to the bench and

621
00:36:57.281 --> 00:37:01.690
went to high five them and Colby completely blew him off right there.

622
00:37:01.691 --> 00:37:05.440
He's lost the team.
But you never know with Colby.
You know what I mean?

623
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:09.490
You know that guy.
He's always fucking,
but I respect what he does.

624
00:37:09.491 --> 00:37:13.240
He just wants to fucking win.
If you suck,
he doesn't try and hide it.

625
00:37:13.241 --> 00:37:15.520
He will embarrass you on TV.
And I guess he's a,

626
00:37:15.521 --> 00:37:17.620
he's earned the fucking right to do that.
Okay.

627
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.150
I'd be pretty even handed here for a Celtics Fan.
You've got,

628
00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:24.570
you've got to give me that.
All right.
All right.

629
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.900
A person with though it Laker flag flapping in the wind as you drive down the

630
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:30.480
street.
Um,
so anyways,

631
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:35.130
they fire Mike Brown and then I hear that they're talking to fucking Phil

632
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:35.963
Jackson and I,

633
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:41.210
I can't even tell you how fucking depressed I was when I heard that Phil

634
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:47.380
Jackson,
Jackson,
Jackson Jackson would possibly be coming back to the Lakers.
I,

635
00:37:47.381 --> 00:37:47.891
it was,

636
00:37:47.891 --> 00:37:52.891
it was the same hopeless feeling I have when I watch baseball where it's the

637
00:37:54.761 --> 00:37:57.370
fact that there's no salary cap in baseball,

638
00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.250
like hoping that the Yankees are going to suck.

639
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.250
It's just never going to happen again.
They got too much fucking money.

640
00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.260
Although the red sox have demonstrated that you can spend 180 million and still

641
00:38:08.321 --> 00:38:09.154
suck.

642
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:10.180
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

643
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.000
<v 1>Um,
and come in last place,
which I believe we did,
but,</v>

644
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:19.390
and I know what you're thinking.
You're like,
well,
the fucking NBA has,

645
00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.920
has a salary cap.
They don't have a hard cap.
They have a salary cap.

646
00:38:23.921 --> 00:38:25.030
This is the salary cap.

647
00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.870
But you can go beyond it and if you have enough fucking money you can fucking,

648
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:29.743
uh,
you know,

649
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.580
you can grease some palms and will allow you to put together these Juggernaut

650
00:38:33.581 --> 00:38:36.580
fucking horseshit bullshit championship

651
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.470
<v 2>teams.
Or I should say a new breed of championship teams.
All right.</v>

652
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.610
Like I don't think

653
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.780
a lot of these championship teams like I,
it just kills me that these guys

654
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.440
just pile on now and then you get your ring,
which is fine,

655
00:38:55.441 --> 00:38:57.570
cause I guess that's the way it's done nowadays.

656
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:03.140
But the fact that you then put on ESPN and they start bringing up guys like Bill

657
00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:07.920
Russell,
Larry Bird,
magic Johnson,
you know,

658
00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:12.120
all these fucking greats who stuck with their team,

659
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:17.300
you know,
and a lot of them didn't get their fucking rings.

660
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.130
<v 1>You,
you,
you earned a ring back in the day.
That's all I'm saying.</v>

661
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:25.870
This shit now with this is like the timeout generation type shit.
You know,

662
00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:29.080
where everybody gets a fucking ribbon.
So I'm sitting there thinking like,

663
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.350
oh my God,
they're going to get Phil Jackson.
I was like,
oh my God,

664
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.423
they're going to get,

665
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:38.550
they're going to get Phil Jackson and Dwight Howard who blew up a fucking team,

666
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.250
choked in the finals,
got his coach fucking fired,

667
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:47.050
is now going to get a ring and those fucking console ESPN ago lathers up plan

668
00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:51.850
how they're going to end the lineage of great Laker centers.
Kareem,

669
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.080
they would actually mentioned them in the same breath is Kareem and shack,

670
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.520
you know,
we'll fucking chaebol and edge just,
it drives me nuts.

671
00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.530
Do you realize the Lakers have never had a fucking great center that was there?

672
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.310
Do you understand that,
that they have been buying centers around the league,

673
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:14.420
like Paris Hilton getting shoes their entire fucking lives.

674
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:18.170
None of that great centers where they guys will Chamberlain,
you know,

675
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:22.460
he played on like every fucking team.
Evidently he was a piece of work.
Um,

676
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.430
I think he did was he fucked every chicken,
the city when he was done,

677
00:40:25.431 --> 00:40:26.270
he switched teams.

678
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:29.850
<v 2>So,
um,</v>

679
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.500
Kareem they got from the box shack they got from Orlando.

680
00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:37.650
And obviously Dwight Howard,
they get from fucking Orlando and it's just,

681
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.580
it's like watching a fucking rich kid,
you know,
whatever.
You know,

682
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.850
I just cracked up my corvette,
you know,
you're like,
oh good,

683
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.900
now he's got to take the bus and no daddy and mommy buy him a new one.
He drives,

684
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.230
you know,
drives to school with it the next fucking day.

685
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.930
So I'm psyched that Phil Jackson didn't come back.

686
00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.730
It just kills me that like that,

687
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:03.740
that that franchise is so fucking insane that they have Phil Jackson on speed

688
00:41:04.371 --> 00:41:07.010
dial to come in whenever they have a fucking problem.

689
00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.850
Like Harvey Keitel in pulp fiction.
He's like the cleaner,

690
00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.530
like he's just going to come in.
Oh my God,
we lost four games in a row.

691
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.690
Call Up Phil Jackson.
It's like,
well I'm sitting there going,

692
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.810
well what the fuck don't the Celtics caught while we got,
you know,

693
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.060
we have a coach,
but I'm just saying,
I don't fucking know.

694
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.200
I am happy that Celtics got a little bit younger,
but um,

695
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.070
this is going to kill me when the Lakers pass the Celtics and

696
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.370
<v 1>championships cause they're going to do it because,
uh,</v>

697
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.900
the people just want to,
why wouldn't you want to play out here?

698
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:45.050
Beautiful weather.
Fuck celebrities dance with Ellen.

699
00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:46.883
<v 0>Yeah.
Know</v>

700
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.210
<v 1>how the fuck are the Celtics going to compete with that?</v>

701
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:55.370
That's cold eight months of the year and then it gets unbearably hot.

702
00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:59.100
No celebrities.
Sandag

703
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:05.450
we've got good lobster,
lobster.
Um,

704
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.290
I dunno.
I don't fucking know.

705
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:13.520
And I swear to God if one more fucking Laker fan brings up the fucking,
you know,

706
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:18.620
Celtics Championship with the big three and it's like,
well you guys to,

707
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:21.980
I realize we did it and I've said it a zillion times.

708
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.160
We bought a championship that year.
All right.

709
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.550
It didn't feel the same as when we went in the fucking eighties.
All right.

710
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.470
But you guys are doing this shit year in and fucking year out.

711
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:40.170
It just,
just racking up these fucking championships going around the league,

712
00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:44.430
picking up free agents like you're some fat fuck at a salad bar.

713
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.900
You know,
it just kills me.

714
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.020
It fucking kills me that this is how you're going to do it.

715
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.330
What can we do in Boston to compete with fucking la?

716
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.640
You know what I would do?
This is what it,
who's kidding,
who the,

717
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.410
the basket basketball is like what?

718
00:43:03.411 --> 00:43:06.980
Like 90% African American.
All right.

719
00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:11.981
So right there you have to somehow make Boston a city that an African American

720
00:43:12.531 --> 00:43:17.360
is going,
going to want to live in.
All right.
And uh,
if you want an like,

721
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.990
we don't,
we don't get good ratings with that crowd.

722
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:29.420
I'm going to go out on a limb and say a lot of people,
a lot of people,

723
00:43:29.421 --> 00:43:33.260
African Americans do not have any interest to go to Boston to check out the

724
00:43:33.261 --> 00:43:38.030
freedom trail or Paul Revere's house considering the stories that they've heard

725
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:40.400
about that city.
You know,

726
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.760
it's funny that Boston gets such a bad reputation for being racist where you

727
00:43:43.761 --> 00:43:44.060
know,

728
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:49.060
like as opposed to what La with their great racial harmony that they have out

729
00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:52.580
here.
Every time the Lakers win a championship,

730
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:56.390
it's like they're happy for five minutes before they start trying to like kill

731
00:43:56.391 --> 00:43:57.410
police officers,

732
00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.460
Tipping Open fucking cruises and all that type of shit.

733
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.733
You know,

734
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:08.390
the last unbelievable race riot in this fucking country was here,

735
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:13.580
the filthiness of the LAPD and all that fucking bullshit.

736
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.170
<v 0>Okay.</v>

737
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.441
<v 1>You know,</v>

738
00:44:15.441 --> 00:44:20.441
allegedly killed Biggie had fucking gang members in the amount of fucking them.

739
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.460
But for some reason,
I know the fucking reason,
but I'm just saying we,

740
00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.320
that's still hanging around our fucking neck.
Like an Albatross.

741
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.630
The average black person,
if you say Boston,

742
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.640
what's the first thing you know about it?
They say it's,
it's,
it's a racist city.

743
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.230
That's basically what the here,

744
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:44.760
so that's what the fuck we're working on in this new era of going out and buying

745
00:44:44.761 --> 00:44:48.900
championships.
You notice Lebron didn't even swing by where the fuck we were at,

746
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:53.700
you know?
Um,
so this is what I would do

747
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.420
as far as the black people.
I know,
you know,

748
00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:03.610
if you start talking conspiracy conspiracy theory there,
they're on board.

749
00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.130
Not all of them,
but a lot of them.

750
00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:10.570
So what I would do is I would basically,

751
00:45:10.571 --> 00:45:13.750
I would make the Zike guide of Los Angeles.

752
00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:19.360
I would show them that film and then,
and then take them on the freedom trail.

753
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:24.250
I would just show la falling into the ocean after some epic fucking,

754
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.930
uh,
uh,
you know,
that big earthquake that's supposed to come,

755
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.593
you know,

756
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.040
and then the footage that I would use to show like how it's on fire and all that

757
00:45:36.041 --> 00:45:40.410
type of shit would be the Rodney king riots.
And um,

758
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.880
and then to ease all this type of shit,

759
00:45:42.881 --> 00:45:46.570
I would be playing that song that I love La.
I love La.

760
00:45:46.571 --> 00:45:49.930
And then you cut to Rodney king getting the shit kicked out of him.
You know,

761
00:45:49.931 --> 00:45:52.720
what I made and all their awful cops.

762
00:45:52.721 --> 00:45:55.120
And I would just show every fucking bad shit about them.

763
00:45:55.121 --> 00:45:56.740
And then I'd have a scientist come in,

764
00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:01.030
talk about how many people are out there versus how much actual water is being

765
00:46:01.031 --> 00:46:02.560
piped into this fucking city.

766
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.670
I'd show video footage of how the Colorado River does not reach the ocean

767
00:46:06.671 --> 00:46:11.560
anymore.
And uh,
yeah,
that's what I would do.

768
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.940
I would make a Hollywood movie to trash Hollywood and then I,

769
00:46:15.941 --> 00:46:20.070
and then I would just show them like lake Winnipesaukee up in,
uh,

770
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.170
up in New Hampshire.
I would just,
let's just say,
listen,

771
00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:30.700
the doll is about ready to crash.
We've taken on too much debt.
You know,

772
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.360
you want to be where the trees are,
where the fresh water is.

773
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:40.990
We'll build you your own fallout shelter with a full court,

774
00:46:41.121 --> 00:46:44.480
full NBA court,
uh,
inside of it.

775
00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:47.650
Whatever your favorite junk food is.
A,

776
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.870
we'll fucking have like 20 refrigerators looking like MTV cribs,

777
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.243
you know,

778
00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.880
you be able to ride out any storm and then he'd come out and we start the league

779
00:46:56.881 --> 00:47:01.500
again with 80% less people living in this country after the fallout.

780
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.280
Right.
Does that sound like a plan?

781
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.770
Anybody from the Celtics Organization is listening.
I am available.
Um,
all right,

782
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:13.430
let's get to the,
uh,
let's get to the,
uh,
the,

783
00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.640
this is going to be a long podcast this week cause I'm already 47 minutes in and

784
00:47:16.641 --> 00:47:19.460
I'm just getting to the,
uh,
the stories and the questions here.
All right,
uh,

785
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.770
alcohol hiccups.
Last week I mentioned that I had,
uh,

786
00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.820
almost terminal hiccups after the Lsu game and just basically I'm,

787
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.310
I didn't get gout

788
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.540
<v 2>the way I,
what I did to my body last weekend.
Um,
anyways,</v>

789
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:39.070
so this guy says here,
hey bill,
sorry to hear about the hiccups at the Lsu game.

790
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.590
Those special ones that don't go away or the worst.

791
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:45.850
I've suffered from bad acid reflux since I was in college and I'm 35 now.

792
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:50.380
So I've tried about every remedy out there and I've learned a lot about it.
Uh,

793
00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:53.770
the hiccups you get when you're drunk and had been eating all day,

794
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:57.610
our extra horrible because they do not go away no matter what you do.

795
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.840
I've had nights,
I've had nights out ruined by this.
Yeah,

796
00:48:01.841 --> 00:48:05.260
you can't hit on some chicken if you got the fucking hiccups.
Um,

797
00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.990
you said I had night's ruined by this until I finally figured it out.

798
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.810
I doubt you'll see this advice on any website.

799
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.040
Most people who never experienced this will tell you to take something for it or

800
00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:20.240
do something that would cure regular everyday hiccups.
It won't work.

801
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:24.710
The last thing you need to do to his stomach that's full and that screwed up his

802
00:48:24.711 --> 00:48:27.170
add something else to it.
Yeah,
cause that's what I was doing.

803
00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:30.830
I was trying to hold my nose and drink water.
Um,

804
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.530
he says if you ever get hiccups like that,
if it happens again,

805
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.990
find an out of the way,
place,

806
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.850
<v 0>uh,</v>

807
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:44.910
<v 2>or an or not take your finger and gently touch your tonsils until you puke.</v>

808
00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.870
You need to get that evil out of you.
It's the only way.

809
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.470
As long as you don't drink too much more after that,

810
00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.490
I'm supposed to keep drinking after that.
It's supposed to run behind a dumpster,

811
00:48:58.491 --> 00:49:00.830
like a fucking bulimic and then keep drinking.
All right,

812
00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.440
I'm going to be open minded here.
I,
he goes,

813
00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:08.330
your hiccups will be gone and you can go on with your night shouting at college

814
00:49:08.331 --> 00:49:12.800
kids or whatever you feel like doing.
Um,
all right.

815
00:49:12.801 --> 00:49:17.801
I'm sure that that does work because I guess you're getting all the fucking shit

816
00:49:18.711 --> 00:49:20.870
out of your stomach that,
I mean,
I don't,
I don't want to,

817
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.290
but the fact that you would then you're like,

818
00:49:24.291 --> 00:49:27.560
get that evil out of your stomach so then you can put more evil into it.

819
00:49:27.561 --> 00:49:30.800
That's like getting out of a bad relationship and then going out and dating

820
00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:31.640
another psycho,

821
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:33.563
<v 0>you know?</v>

822
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.580
<v 2>Do you know when I actually,</v>

823
00:49:35.581 --> 00:49:39.990
when I got rid of the hiccups is what I did was I came home and I just started

824
00:49:39.991 --> 00:49:44.880
eating right and I stopped putting evil in my stomach and I was fine.
But um,

825
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.001
I would,

826
00:49:47.001 --> 00:49:52.001
I would probably say what you want to do is yet stop eating and then the next

827
00:49:52.431 --> 00:49:56.300
time you get hungry,
I would have like a salad,
maybe some lemon water,

828
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.820
something really easy on the stomach.

829
00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.890
And I would think that they would go away naturally.

830
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.130
But I guess if you're in a pinch,
I don't want to ever,

831
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:09.320
I don't want to ever like promote going up and puking and then you're basically

832
00:50:09.321 --> 00:50:13.850
like a,
you're like a partying bulimic were bulimic.

833
00:50:13.851 --> 00:50:15.920
We'll go out and eat like fudge and cake and all that shit.

834
00:50:15.921 --> 00:50:18.410
They're not supposed to have an a pizza and then go out and puke it up.

835
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.370
You're doing that I guess with like alcohol in potato skins.

836
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.580
MMM.
Interesting theory.
I'm sure it works,

837
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:32.240
but I,
I'm not willing to pay the price,
but thank you for,
uh,
for trying to help.

838
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:32.601
I'm just,

839
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:37.601
I'm just gonna try not to swam five Michelob and then eat like fucking a sausage

840
00:50:39.371 --> 00:50:44.260
king of Burger and in some sort of po boy sandwich all within like two hours.

841
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.150
I think I had some scotch in there too.
I can't even remember.
Oh,
Jamison.
Anyways,

842
00:50:49.151 --> 00:50:52.640
here we got bill from the military.
Um,

843
00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.410
I have faithfully served in the military for five years now.

844
00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:59.640
I currently have three years left to go on my illest enlistment.
Jesus.
Dude,

845
00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:04.630
don't you re up after four.
So I guess that's what you did.

846
00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.580
There's no eight year enlistment.
Is there?

847
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.450
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

848
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:10.640
<v 2>Do you start as a Sajan?
Um,</v>

849
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.760
let me pre face my dilemma by saying that I loved the military.

850
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:17.210
It has provided me with opportunities I wouldn't have never dreamed of.

851
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:22.070
It got me out of the dead end life that I was living in my podunk,
Texas town.

852
00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.200
I've been to places and experiences,

853
00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.350
experienced things that I never would have thought possible before.

854
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:32.140
I made so many great friends and bonds that will land at last a lifetime.
Now,

855
00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.360
within the past couple four years,

856
00:51:33.361 --> 00:51:37.350
I've come to the realization that we in the military are just pawns for these

857
00:51:37.351 --> 00:51:39.270
corporate scum Fox to make a buck.

858
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.450
We go to war for money and resource control.

859
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:45.570
People think that we're fighting for freedom or anybody.

860
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.870
People that think worth fighting for freedom or anybody else's freedom either

861
00:51:48.871 --> 00:51:52.740
has their head up their ass or they are just uninformed.

862
00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:56.310
I'm sure you know this,
all of this already,
so we'll save you the rent.

863
00:51:56.610 --> 00:52:00.300
There are ways I can get out of my enlistment early and maintain an honorable

864
00:52:00.301 --> 00:52:01.410
stay status.

865
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:06.030
Now with the war drums beating for Iran like they did for Iraq almost a decade

866
00:52:06.031 --> 00:52:06.600
ago.

867
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:10.260
Do I try and get out early and risks feeling like a coward and a pussy for the

868
00:52:10.261 --> 00:52:14.580
rest of my life or do I stay in and risk dying or watching friends dies for a

869
00:52:14.581 --> 00:52:18.660
cause?
I no longer believe in sincerely anonymous military member.

870
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:24.300
MMM.
Yeah.

871
00:52:24.301 --> 00:52:26.780
I all,
well the first thing I would say is when,
uh,

872
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.750
when you're presenting your opinions.

873
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.950
<v 4>Okay.</v>

874
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:34.490
<v 2>All of it's great,
but if you say people who don't get it,
uh,</v>

875
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.510
you should just say don't have access to the information they need when you go

876
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.550
have their head up their ass.

877
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.050
Anybody who's just listening to this is now immediately like pulling back.

878
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:51.950
Yeah.
Look,
uh,
I can't argue with any of that.
Okay.
Yeah.
No,

879
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:54.770
I don't think you're a coward if you don't re up.
You already fought in a war,

880
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:59.000
you know what I mean?
You don't believe in it.
Yeah,
I would,

881
00:52:59.001 --> 00:53:02.470
I would definitely get out.
I mean,
as far as this last thing,
I mean,

882
00:53:02.471 --> 00:53:05.290
I was all about go get a Sama bin.
Ladin okay.

883
00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:08.350
I'm believing what you're telling me that he was behind those attacks.

884
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.480
We need to go in there and go get that fucking guy.

885
00:53:10.481 --> 00:53:14.160
But I never for once believed that we were going to Iraq to try and liberate

886
00:53:14.161 --> 00:53:19.140
those people.
You know,
I mean,
shit,
the corporations and government,

887
00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:20.880
they don't give a fuck about people who live here.

888
00:53:20.881 --> 00:53:23.070
Why would they give a shit about people over there?
They don't give a fuck.

889
00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:24.090
Could give a flying fuck.

890
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:25.350
<v 4>Okay,</v>

891
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:28.920
<v 1>I totally agree with that.
All right.
So,
and I was saying was our guy,</v>

892
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.420
and we didn't give a shit what he was doing as long as he was doing what we want

893
00:53:32.421 --> 00:53:37.350
them to do.
And then when he didn't and he started going rogue,
you know,
we,

894
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:38.970
uh,
all of a sudden we're like,
hey,

895
00:53:38.971 --> 00:53:42.930
this bad guy that we're in business with is a bad guy.
He's evil.

896
00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.550
For some reason,

897
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.360
we didn't notice that for the first 15 fucking years we were in business with

898
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:51.510
them.
Wherever the fuck it was first 10 years,
what do we put him in?

899
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:56.040
I always get confused.
Was it like in the seventies or something?
Yeah.

900
00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.590
Like he gassed his people and we didn't get outraged.

901
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:03.250
You know enough to do something for like another fucking eight years.
I mean,
I,

902
00:54:03.251 --> 00:54:05.150
you know,
I,
I don't,
I don't fucking know.
I,

903
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.620
my experience that I've learned from traveling is that,
that people are people,

904
00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.920
you know,
we're just a,
you know,

905
00:54:12.921 --> 00:54:16.400
the average person is not evil.
You know,

906
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:18.890
they're walking around that they want,
they want a job,

907
00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:22.460
they want to be able to provide for their family and they want to find true
love.

908
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:23.840
That's all they really want.

909
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:27.410
They don't want to control other people and all that.
It's just,
it's,
I dunno,

910
00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.850
what would you say 15%

911
00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:34.330
of of the population is a sociopath's?
Is it higher than that?

912
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:38.860
Those are the people.
I don't know.
I,
it's,
it's,

913
00:54:38.861 --> 00:54:43.220
it's just too depressing to talk topic to discuss.
I would get out,
okay,

914
00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.530
you're lucky enough to survive.
You did your duty.

915
00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.140
If you don't believe in it in any more,
you know,

916
00:54:48.141 --> 00:54:50.060
and who can fucking question you.
They keep him,

917
00:54:50.061 --> 00:54:51.680
questioned me and say that I'm full of Shit.

918
00:54:51.681 --> 00:54:54.950
I'm some fucking jackass who never went.
You don't sit in here.

919
00:54:54.951 --> 00:54:56.470
You could definitely trash me.
But you,

920
00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.360
if you're there and that's what you're seeing and that's what your gut is

921
00:54:59.361 --> 00:55:03.320
telling you,
you gotta act on it.
That's what I was saying.
All right.

922
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:09.710
That's what they did say.
Um,
yeah.
That shit's just too fucking depressing.

923
00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:13.160
I hate seeing that.
I hate,
like,

924
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:18.200
I hate listening to rhetoric that's trying to make me afraid of other fucking

925
00:55:18.201 --> 00:55:21.530
people.
They're going to do this.
They are going to do that.

926
00:55:21.531 --> 00:55:22.820
They're going to do this.
They're going to do that.

927
00:55:22.821 --> 00:55:25.310
That's exactly what the fuck they saying over there.
They ain't going to do this.

928
00:55:25.311 --> 00:55:26.480
They ain't going to do that.
They did this,

929
00:55:26.481 --> 00:55:31.280
they did that and then everybody gets all fucking amped up.
You know?

930
00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:36.330
And then this is,
this is completely unoriginal
thought.
Everybody knows us.

931
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.540
And then the cons,
who gets everybody all stirred up.
They don't fucking do shit.

932
00:55:39.541 --> 00:55:41.670
They sit back and watch everybody,

933
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:44.670
they got all stirred up and then they hope that their team fucking wins.

934
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.110
Um,
yeah,
so I would get out,

935
00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.470
I will get out.
I mean,
I,
yeah,

936
00:55:53.471 --> 00:55:58.180
it takes balls to get out to say fuck this.
Don't give into that.
Peer pressure.

937
00:55:58.181 --> 00:56:00.550
You're,
you're,
you already did it.
You already did it.
All right.

938
00:56:00.551 --> 00:56:02.770
I'm just keep saying the same thing over and over again,
so yeah.

939
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:04.580
<v 4>Okay.</v>

940
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.550
<v 1>Yeah.
All right.
Animal Control Officer.
Mr. Byrd,</v>

941
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:12.950
I'm a big fan and I caught your show in Cincinnati,
uh,
in October.
You killed it.

942
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:14.330
Thanks for the laughs.

943
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:18.620
I'm an animal control officer and Kentucky and I have been and have been for two

944
00:56:18.621 --> 00:56:22.970
years.
The job is really getting me down.
Lately I have to euthanize animals.

945
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:27.280
This used to not be a problem for me because I felt it was a necessary evil.

946
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:31.030
Jesus Christ,
he's going to be most depressing fucking emails ever.

947
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:33.760
Ah,
here we go.

948
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:37.360
I deal with some of the lowest people on the planet and I'm starting to hate

949
00:56:37.361 --> 00:56:38.194
people.

950
00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.740
I would rather put down the low life owners then the poor fucking animals that

951
00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:42.670
didn't get a fair shot.

952
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.900
<v 0>Okay.</v>

953
00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.350
<v 1>Wow.
Somebody who you know that's fucking crush should be in a movie.</v>

954
00:56:51.351 --> 00:56:55.790
Somebody just snap it in an animal shelter.
Yeah.
Hey,
whoa.

955
00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.560
Hold it down.
Hold down spot.
You know,

956
00:56:57.561 --> 00:57:00.080
and you'd get them to hold them down and then you fucking stick it in their
neck.

957
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:02.810
They have that,
you know,
like great confused.
Look somebody has,

958
00:57:02.811 --> 00:57:06.050
when they realize that they're being killed in the tables turned and movies.

959
00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.480
It's one of my favorite scenes in those movies.
But wait,
I meet you.
Um,

960
00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.120
anyways,
uh,

961
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:18.110
I come home mentally drained in the animal control community.

962
00:57:18.111 --> 00:57:20.390
They call it compassion fatigue.

963
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:24.680
Yeah.
God.
In another life,

964
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:27.740
I really want to go the corporate route cause I just want to be in a room when

965
00:57:27.741 --> 00:57:32.060
they're pitching.
Like what,
what can we call this?

966
00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.800
<v 0>MMM.</v>

967
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:41.130
<v 1>Doggy dts,
Nah,
Nah,</v>

968
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.870
that dts,
that's too much like a addiction.

969
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.290
Then somebody comes up with compassion fatigue and they actually get a fucking

970
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:48.124
high five

971
00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:53.820
and they all go out and get a taco salad ever fucking idiots.
Um,

972
00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:56.730
plus I worked for a micro managing cont.

973
00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:00.780
The pays pretty good for my area of the world and I have really good benefits.

974
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:05.160
My problem is I got offered a shit job making less money with less benefits.

975
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.310
The job would required me to travel more,
which is great for me.

976
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:13.290
I just have a problem walking away from the cash and the benefits.
I have a son,

977
00:58:13.291 --> 00:58:15.570
so I want to provide as best as possible for him,

978
00:58:15.571 --> 00:58:18.570
but I feel like I should take my happiness into consideration.

979
00:58:18.571 --> 00:58:23.571
Also helped me out here a walk and be happier or stay and make more money.

980
00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.540
Thanks for the podcast.
Go Fuck Yourself.
A PSD.

981
00:58:29.541 --> 00:58:33.990
You get tired of people telling you to go fuck yourself.
Um,
uh,
no,
not really.

982
00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.940
Now that you just said that,
I guess it's getting a little old.

983
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:38.323
<v 0>MMM.</v>

984
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:42.540
<v 1>Anyways,
but then again,
I say it at the end of my every fucking one.</v>

985
00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:50.440
Where am I?
What the fuck are we talking about?
Um,
well,
I,

986
00:58:50.441 --> 00:58:52.010
I would walk and choose happiness.

987
00:58:52.011 --> 00:58:55.070
You'll be a happier dead all the kid really fucking wants.

988
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:58.910
He wants to know that he's safe and that he's loved.
All right.

989
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:00.770
And you know,

990
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:04.520
there's a bunch of kids out there who have iPads and all that fucking crap and

991
00:59:04.521 --> 00:59:06.590
their dad's never around.
I swear to God,

992
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.410
you know what the greatest thing when I was a kid was when my dad had time to go

993
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:12.620
out in the backyard and throw the fucking ball around.
If you just do that,

994
00:59:12.621 --> 00:59:14.750
I don't give a shit where you live in,
you know?

995
00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.570
And we had up to the up and down financial times when I was growing up,

996
00:59:17.571 --> 00:59:20.900
we had a house,
we lost the house,
moved into a duplex.
You,

997
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.490
but I still had a great time.
You know,
I still had a fucking great time.

998
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:30.491
So kids [inaudible] your kid isn't going to know that you're making less money

999
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:35.050
unless you're making like fucking 700 grand a year to,
uh,

1000
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:39.050
put dogs down and then you go to making 30 grand a year.

1001
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:44.720
But,
um,
you're,
you're,
you're fine.
You're fine.
I would think

1002
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:50.270
I would choose happiness.
All right.
So there you go.
Once again.

1003
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.350
Now the question in way over my head,
I was never in the military.

1004
00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.490
I don't have a son.

1005
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:57.230
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:59.570
<v 1>You know,
so take that with a grain of salt.
Anyways,</v>

1007
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.430
wife's weird sex store purchase.
Oh,
G,
here we go.

1008
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.570
Wife's weird.
Um,
dear bill,

1009
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.440
me and my wife had been married for two months and she has been less involved

1010
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:16.760
and willing to have sex.
All right.
Right there.

1011
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.950
And she got up a weird sex store purchase.

1012
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:23.960
I don't even need to read the rest of this,
sir.
Have it a knelt.
Um,
anyways,

1013
01:00:23.961 --> 01:00:27.770
he goes,
I thought the honeymoon phase was just ending and started to adapt.

1014
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:32.270
It's been two weeks since we last had sex and Friday while taking out the

1015
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:36.170
garbage,
I found a bag to the local sex shop.

1016
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.950
Okay.
That's it.
I don't need to read anymore.

1017
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.710
Just get it a nulled go your separate way.

1018
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.900
I didn't know what she bought and since we haven't been having sex,

1019
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:52.330
it was a puzzler.
Okay.
That's it to,

1020
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.440
it's this whole fucking thing.
It's over.

1021
01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.760
I then started snooping.
Okay.
That's it.

1022
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:03.260
While she was at work and found a Dildo in the closet.

1023
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.130
I know women have them,
but this one wasn't your usual dildo up.

1024
01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.200
<v 3>Okay.
Nothing to see here.</v>

1025
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1026
01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:18.180
<v 1>Dude,
this has more red flags than the,</v>

1027
01:01:18.181 --> 01:01:22.590
than the fucking opening ceremony of China at the Olympics.

1028
01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:27.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1029
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:31.050
<v 1>Okay.
Was it your usual Dildo?
Jumping back in.</v>

1030
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.850
We're losing a lot of tiles.

1031
01:01:32.851 --> 01:01:36.600
I think we're going to burn up here and fucking reentry.
Um,

1032
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:41.590
it was the shape of an animal's penis

1033
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.353
<v 3>there lady.</v>

1034
01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.830
Keep everything.

1035
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.950
I'm just going to take my t shirts and my shoes and a pair of pants.

1036
01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:58.340
<v 1>It was close to a foot long.</v>

1037
01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:59.283
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1038
01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.450
<v 1>and weirdly shaped.
Wait a minute.</v>

1039
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:06.060
They don't make animal dildos to what?

1040
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:10.920
What does an animal penis even look like?
I don't even,

1041
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:15.000
I've seen an elephant.
Fuck.
It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1042
01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:19.220
Seen Dogs.
Bang.
Anyways,

1043
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.870
it was close to a foot long and weirdly shaped.

1044
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:24.960
I have kept quiet,

1045
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.010
but I really want to confront her but don't know how to do it without hurting

1046
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:33.900
her feelings or opening a crazy can of worms.
Please help bill.

1047
01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:39.210
All right dude.
You know
you,
you need,

1048
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:42.360
you need,
if you're not just going to walk,

1049
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:45.380
you really need professional help on this one.

1050
01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:47.910
<v 4>All right.</v>

1051
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.500
<v 1>I mean,
ha ha.
I don't know what,
what do you do?</v>

1052
01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.970
Do you take the thing out of the trash and then just leave it on the fucking

1053
01:02:56.971 --> 01:03:01.920
coffee table and then she walks in and just,
you're just pacing.
Hey honey,

1054
01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:05.430
how was your day?
And you just fucking wait.
What?
What's this?

1055
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.230
I just found this in the fucking trash,
Huh?

1056
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.720
Which orifice will you shoving this in?
I mean,
there's no fucking way to,

1057
01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:17.670
how do you even bring that up?
Listen,
do I got to tell you this right now?

1058
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.830
Your wife has a huge dildo now.

1059
01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:23.560
Your wife has,

1060
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.560
or your wife has a huge skeleton.

1061
01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:32.370
Subdued.
Did something gigantic going on.
I've got a kid,

1062
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:34.260
got to stop seeing gigantic and huge.

1063
01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:37.520
She's got a big secret.

1064
01:03:37.521 --> 01:03:41.210
Bigger than that fucking Giraffe Dildo you found in the fucking garbage.

1065
01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:46.480
Um,
you're,

1066
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:47.590
you're two months in dude,

1067
01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:51.310
and you're already not getting the sex is already a fucking issue.

1068
01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:55.840
All right.
Now it sounds like you really loved this woman.

1069
01:03:55.841 --> 01:03:58.120
The fact that you're actually still willing to work this out,

1070
01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.640
but as an outsider with no feelings,

1071
01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.250
no,
no heart,
no broken heart on the line here.
Um,

1072
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:13.360
you know,
I,
I think he just got a walk.

1073
01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:18.320
I see.
I know.
You know what I,

1074
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.280
what would I say?
I would just say,
I'm literally sitting here right now guys,

1075
01:04:25.281 --> 01:04:28.520
and I'm,
I'm,
I'm rubbing my eyes.
You know,
when you do that with one hand,

1076
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:32.450
you know that move,
I'm doing that right now.
Trying to think of how to fucking,

1077
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.710
how do I bring this up?

1078
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.250
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1079
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.980
<v 1>I would take the fucking hippo cock</v>

1080
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:45.210
and I would,
I would put it in one of those big brown bags,

1081
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.290
if it can fit from Macy's,
whatever you got to do.
Maybe like one of those,

1082
01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:51.540
you know,
when they plastic wrap,
like a Christmas tree,

1083
01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:54.570
I would find one of those bags and I'd stick it in that

1084
01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.530
and I would just say,
honey,
I need to talk to you about something.
All right.

1085
01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:04.280
And I would sit it down,
dude.
Fuck this and fuck a fucking feelings.
All right,

1086
01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:05.960
I see.
I had to get past the shock here.

1087
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:07.993
<v 4>All right.</v>

1088
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:12.000
<v 1>Just sit her down and say,
listen,
I'm not judging you.</v>

1089
01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.920
Um,
I,
I,
you know,
I just need some honesty here because

1090
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.400
<v 2>this is a gigantic,
huge</v>

1091
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.440
fucking gorilla dick that I found.
It's trash.

1092
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.970
Okay?
You haven't been having sex with me.

1093
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.850
It's going on.
What is,
just tell me what is going on.

1094
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.030
I'm not going to tell anybody about this other than this podcast.

1095
01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:46.720
I'm not going to judge you just level with me.

1096
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.983
<v 4>Do you?</v>

1097
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:52.780
<v 2>Is this why you wanted to go to the zoo the other day?
No,</v>

1098
01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.980
just you got to get it out there,
dude.

1099
01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.300
You got to get it out there and you have to hear her fucking story and you have

1100
01:05:59.301 --> 01:06:03.560
to be supportive both for her feelings and for you,

1101
01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:07.190
for the fact that you deserve to know the fucking truth about this before you

1102
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:11.600
spend the rest of your life with somebody who's going to bang you once every two

1103
01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:15.350
months while secretly wanting to fuck a tiger.

1104
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:21.550
Well,
what I,
I'll,
I'll fucking grizzly bear do this.
No,

1105
01:06:21.551 --> 01:06:25.390
they don't make animal dildos and I swear to God,

1106
01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:28.000
you fucking assholes.
If there is a website,

1107
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:29.920
don't send me the link because I'm not looking at it.

1108
01:06:29.921 --> 01:06:33.070
I don't need that on my hard drive.
I'm not looking at it,
dude.

1109
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:37.060
You have to sit her down.
Okay.
And,
and you,

1110
01:06:37.061 --> 01:06:40.360
you have to bring,
you got to bring in that Zebra Dick.

1111
01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:44.980
You just have to do it.
You got to do it.

1112
01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:50.260
You gotta do it.
You all would see yourself.
All right.

1113
01:06:50.261 --> 01:06:52.570
And as much as it's going to be embarrassing for her and everything,

1114
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:56.390
it's going to help her out because I bet that there's a part of her that she,

1115
01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:58.270
she doesn't like herself,

1116
01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:03.280
that she's sneaking around and starting to live this lie and all our are or

1117
01:07:03.281 --> 01:07:07.630
whatever the fuck is going on.
I Dunno.

1118
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:08.801
I would also bring it,

1119
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:11.590
maybe bring it to the sex store and ask somebody what this is before.

1120
01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:13.990
Like you make a complete ass of yourself.
Cause God knows what.

1121
01:07:13.991 --> 01:07:17.710
If it's something else,
what if it's like a fucking,
uh,
you know,

1122
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:22.380
you don't let those wood things that's on an old staircase.
Um,

1123
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:27.370
I don't fucking know.
Uh,
all right.
On a banister.
Um,

1124
01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.001
all right.
Hey,

1125
01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:32.080
here's a classic we're bringing back that I had to drop because I think a Daniel

1126
01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:35.560
tosh already did.
Uh,
is it racist thing?

1127
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:40.480
But this falls under the category of is it racist,
racist,
racist,
racist,

1128
01:07:40.481 --> 01:07:45.280
racist.
Um,
all right.
Is this guy okay?
Man,

1129
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.790
this shit has been bothering me for about a week and I can't let it go.

1130
01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:53.800
I work at a national laboratory with a lot of employees,
a lot,
a l,
a,
l,
l,

1131
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:58.330
O,
t,
a lot of employees,
everyone in between,

1132
01:07:58.331 --> 01:08:02.440
ranging from the Dorky phd scientists with no skills to the janitor and

1133
01:08:02.441 --> 01:08:05.980
groundskeeper.
Two words.
Who's usually

1134
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.380
are either immigrants or just g,
e,
D I n educated people.

1135
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:12.450
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1136
01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.910
<v 2>Anyways,
I'm a pretty social guy who walks,</v>

1137
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:18.320
who talks to everyone and gets along with most.
Uh,

1138
01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:22.550
I'd been working here for eight years and know a lot of people.
A L,
l,
O,

1139
01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:26.270
t of people here.
It's a l.
O.
T.

1140
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:27.920
Um,

1141
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:32.920
well there is this janitor dude named Montez.

1142
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.050
If the name Devon,
give it away.
He is black and I myself are,

1143
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:43.310
are pretty white.
Okay?

1144
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:47.310
Montez doesn't strike me as a black guy's name.
And your grammar is terrible.
Uh,

1145
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.470
not shockingly Caucasian as yourself,
but pretty close.
Well,

1146
01:08:51.471 --> 01:08:55.550
I thought I was kind of friends with Montez as I would frequently bullshit with

1147
01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:57.080
him at work throughout the years.

1148
01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.740
I've been working here until just last week.

1149
01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:06.590
All right,
so basically you're a scientist with this fucking bad grammar.

1150
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.810
Um,
anyways,

1151
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:12.510
<v 1>this is smoking hot young girl who that was hired about a year ago,</v>

1152
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:16.800
a 21 year old delicious Lee Young Black Girl Name Patricia.

1153
01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.290
All right.
Delicious.
Lee made it creepy.
Um,
at my work
it,

1154
01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:27.060
my work of scientists,
there are a lot of good looking women in the building,

1155
01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.940
so any good looking chick gets noticed.

1156
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:34.350
So she was going to school to be a nurse and for whatever personal reasons she

1157
01:09:34.351 --> 01:09:37.940
quit school.
She works as a janitor.
Oh.

1158
01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:42.480
So she works as a janitor there.
The delicious Lee young black girl.

1159
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.801
Um,

1160
01:09:43.801 --> 01:09:48.570
so last week on bullshitting with Montez and I'm asking him where his partner is

1161
01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.810
referring to,
Patricia,
he asked me who I respond,

1162
01:09:51.811 --> 01:09:55.740
the young girl who was going to school to be a nurse.
And he goes,

1163
01:09:55.741 --> 01:09:59.790
and I don't know what possessed me,
but I added in the conversation that girl,

1164
01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:02.520
that girl shouldn't have quit school.

1165
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:07.830
It's stupid to just quit as it only takes a few years to rough that shit out.

1166
01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:11.610
And then you have a degree and nobody can take it from you.

1167
01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.600
Uh,
this is when Monte has got pissed off.
He says to me,

1168
01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:19.990
don't call my friends stupid.
He says,
I'm like,
what?

1169
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:25.620
Uh,
shut the fuck up man.
She should.
Oh,
you're like,
I'm like,
what?

1170
01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:28.680
Shut the fuck up man.
She should have finished school.
Don't you agree?

1171
01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:32.760
Otherwise she stuck here being a janitor with no education.

1172
01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.980
And you said this to a janitor.
Ah,
that's a good move.
Uh,
but if she graduates,

1173
01:10:37.981 --> 01:10:41.040
she can move anywhere and still have that,

1174
01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.230
that piece of paper,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And he spells piece p a,

1175
01:10:45.231 --> 01:10:49.040
I.
C.
E.
Um,

1176
01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.750
and this guy is bitching about this other guy.
Okay.
He replies,

1177
01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.150
not if she don't want to be a nurse.
What if she wants to be a January janitor?

1178
01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.590
I fall.
I followed with,
that's fucked up.

1179
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:05.460
And if it was your own daughter when you want her to finish school now he's all

1180
01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:09.120
sorts of pissed off.
He makes comments about how you'll be happy on Wednesday,

1181
01:11:09.121 --> 01:11:11.070
won't you?
Referring to the election.

1182
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:14.760
I think he was taking a shot at me and I wanted Rodney and office.

1183
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:19.800
I realized he had just pulled the race card and I can't believe it after

1184
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:24.630
insulting him and what he does for a living,
um,
egos.
I asked him,

1185
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.430
I asked him,
are you fucking serious?

1186
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.690
He gets all thug and tries staring at me with this hate acting all hard.

1187
01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:33.600
Like he wants to fight me.
We're both 40 plus years old.

1188
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.180
All the while there are people near us who are starting,

1189
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:41.730
who hear us starting to argue fighting is not acceptable at work.

1190
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.340
Not even arguing,
especially about a race issue.

1191
01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.760
It's not politically correct and all that bullshit.
Um,

1192
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:50.400
if this were a high school,
we would have been fighting,

1193
01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:53.460
but I'm 42 years old and have a mortgage and a career,
et cetera.

1194
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:56.910
This dude is also about five foot 10,
one 80,
and I'm a lot bigger than him.

1195
01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:01.200
So what do I do?
I apologize to him,
dude.
If I said something to Piss you off,

1196
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:02.670
I didn't mean it.
And I apologize.

1197
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:07.820
He continues being a dick to where I tell him I apologize once motherfucker and

1198
01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:09.900
that shit is not going to happen again.

1199
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.980
And now I'm getting pissed off and people starting to stare and I have to walk

1200
01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:15.390
away.
But before I do,

1201
01:12:15.391 --> 01:12:20.391
I tell him under my breath that he's his stupid motherfucker and go clean some

1202
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:22.494
shit.

1203
01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:23.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1204
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:28.380
<v 1>Jesus Christ dude.
Then he goes,
what did I do wrong there</v>

1205
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:37.770
other than the parting shot I gave him?
I can't stop thinking about it.
I mean,

1206
01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:40.800
I liked the guy and that's what pisses me off about it most.

1207
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:44.670
Am I fucking racist or is it him?
Uh,

1208
01:12:44.671 --> 01:12:47.280
I don't think I said anything out of out of line,

1209
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:52.770
but maybe I did before telling him to fuck off that is I'm going to see this

1210
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:56.310
mother fucker at work and I have a hard time with letting things go,

1211
01:12:56.311 --> 01:13:00.120
but my job is more important.
Just wanted your advice.
Is it me?

1212
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.930
<v 2>Yeah.
Dude.
Actually,
I don't know if you're racist,</v>

1213
01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.520
but you're,
you're,
you're an idiot.
You're an idiot.

1214
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:15.240
You walked up to a janitor
and you basically,

1215
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:19.200
you belittled what he did for a living before you even said,

1216
01:13:19.201 --> 01:13:20.730
why don't you go clean some shit?

1217
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:23.483
<v 0>All right.</v>

1218
01:13:25.150 --> 01:13:29.470
<v 2>And you also didn't take into consideration that it could have been like,
uh,</v>

1219
01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.750
financial reasons why she quit.

1220
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:33.793
<v 0>You know,</v>

1221
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.010
<v 2>who knows?
Who knows why she fucking quit?</v>

1222
01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:42.080
It doesn't make sense that someone would quit nursing to then go up and,
and,

1223
01:13:42.081 --> 01:13:46.760
and be a janitor.
So right there,
you should have fucking left it alone.

1224
01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.400
That usually means some sort of fucking drama happened.

1225
01:13:49.401 --> 01:13:52.520
Who the fuck knows what happened?
Something happened.

1226
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:57.020
There could be a zillion fucking scenarios

1227
01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:03.420
as to why she became w ended up being,
uh,
working there as a janitor.

1228
01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.950
All right.
And you're saying to a janitor who at this point is in his forties,

1229
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:11.680
he's still a fucking janitor.
He's taken pride in what the he's doing.

1230
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.160
<v 1>You know,
people shit on Janet is all the fucking time.</v>

1231
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.860
He knows that anybody who goes around cleaning up shit,

1232
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:20.500
they know what people are going to be saying.

1233
01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:22.900
Do you know you're supposed to treat everybody with fucking respecting it did.

1234
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.400
So look what you're saying is right,
but you said it to the wrong guy.

1235
01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.310
You know,
if you had a daughter,

1236
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:35.340
you wouldn't want to quit nursing school then become a janitor.
He wouldn't,

1237
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.380
but you don't fucking say that to a janitor.
You know?

1238
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:42.440
And you're also kind of a creep where you sitting there saying,

1239
01:14:42.441 --> 01:14:44.210
she's a delicious Lee young black girl.

1240
01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:48.020
I'm going to say that this some more shit going on with you.
And uh,

1241
01:14:48.021 --> 01:14:51.350
why will you act asking why,
where this delicious you,
first of all,

1242
01:14:51.351 --> 01:14:53.570
you fucking 42 fucking years old.

1243
01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:57.020
You shouldn't be looking at some 21 year old girl,
like she's delicious.

1244
01:14:57.170 --> 01:15:00.200
You fucking creep.
Sorry this took me a minute,
dude,

1245
01:15:00.201 --> 01:15:05.060
you're fucking creep and you're a moron and you're allegedly as scientists and

1246
01:15:05.061 --> 01:15:08.900
you can't even spell.
So I don't even,

1247
01:15:08.901 --> 01:15:12.110
I don't know what you do over there.
This is bad right now.

1248
01:15:12.111 --> 01:15:16.100
Cause now I'm insulting you and you're not gonna learn anything from the shit.

1249
01:15:16.101 --> 01:15:18.140
Like,
dude,
all right,
here's some rules.

1250
01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.840
And then you never make fun of what somebody does for living.
All right.

1251
01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:23.900
And I'm not going to judge you because I did that one time.

1252
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:28.140
I got into a fight with somebody and he was a bartender and um,

1253
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:32.450
I was working in a club and the guy was in the middle of washing glasses and I,

1254
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.860
we've gotten this fucking argument about sports,
red sox,
Yankees,
Shit.
And I said,

1255
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:41.810
I'll go wash a fucking glass.
Not realizing
that I,

1256
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.670
I didn't mean it like I was belittling what the fuck he did.
He,

1257
01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.650
he was just washing glasses.

1258
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:52.240
So I said it and I did and he fucking like was ready to stab me.

1259
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.100
And I actually,
someone told me later,
dude,

1260
01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.490
you can't fucking say that shit.
And I was like,
I didn't mean it that way.

1261
01:15:59.491 --> 01:16:02.670
Fuck came about by,
once I got on my ego,
I learned.
I was like,
all right,

1262
01:16:02.671 --> 01:16:06.600
I can't do that.
And you,
you can't sit there at your level.

1263
01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:10.140
You're at an a and an economic level above this fucking guy.
Although I,

1264
01:16:10.141 --> 01:16:14.950
the way you spelled,
you know,
I don't know,
you can't do that dude.
You,
you,

1265
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.210
you,
I dunno if you're going to get it,

1266
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:22.550
but like to say that shit in the end to call,

1267
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:27.350
say that he's dumb
and then say go,

1268
01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:31.830
go fucking clean.
Something like,
but
I dunno,

1269
01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:35.460
that's one of those things where it just escalated and then he got your grill

1270
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.890
and he's fucking act like he's going to kick the shit out of you.

1271
01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:42.570
And then you got mad.
So then you said that shit.
And then he gets the think,

1272
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.050
you see that you were thinking that shit the whole fucking time,

1273
01:16:46.710 --> 01:16:51.040
which you probably weren't right until then.
You know.

1274
01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.710
So what you basically did is you ruined the next 60 white people that black dude

1275
01:16:56.711 --> 01:17:01.330
is going to run into because he's going to keep thinking about you.
So,
um,

1276
01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:07.020
this is the deal.
That's some shit you can't apologize for.
Like,

1277
01:17:07.021 --> 01:17:10.160
you guys are never going to be friends again.
Um,

1278
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:16.100
<v 2>but you still should apologize.
I Dunno.</v>

1279
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:16.940
And then what's he gonna do?

1280
01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:19.220
Act like he's going to kick the shit out of you and then it's going to fuck.

1281
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:22.990
I am,
I think it might be a wrap.
Just might be a fucking rap.
I don't know.

1282
01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:26.270
I felt halfway through that I was trashing them for being a fucking janitor.

1283
01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:31.460
You know?
What did we learn that people don't make fun of?

1284
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:36.461
Janner don't make fun of somebody being a janitor to a janitor because they're

1285
01:17:36.831 --> 01:17:37.664
going to get mad.

1286
01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:47.680
Uh,
I don't know about you,
dude.
You're a creep.

1287
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:53.250
You're a creep.
Look,
I'm not gonna sit there and actually is a 44 year old guy.

1288
01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:56.100
You know,
it's,
I don't see a girl in her twenties and if she's fucking gorgeous,

1289
01:17:56.101 --> 01:17:59.100
you know,
but I always address that.
I'm 44 years old.

1290
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.550
I always address it like if I'm with somebody,
but I'm with somebody,

1291
01:18:04.551 --> 01:18:08.000
like we make a joke about how fucking old we are or something like that.

1292
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:09.830
But the older I get,
the more I start thinking like,

1293
01:18:09.831 --> 01:18:10.850
why would you dress like that?

1294
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:14.690
Don't you realize the fucking asshole you're going to be attracting to you?

1295
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:18.290
You know,
there's something about that word delicious,
Lee.

1296
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:23.210
It's just absolutely fucking disgusting.
And I feel,
I think you're a creep.

1297
01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.013
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1298
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.860
<v 2>You know,
sub level,</v>

1299
01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.660
you're that fucking guy that ruins it.

1300
01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:37.350
You know,
you're the one that takes it into that creepy fucking area than the,

1301
01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:40.480
and it's just such a creep that you make the person you're with feel like a

1302
01:18:40.481 --> 01:18:45.190
fucking pervert,
you know?
Uh,
I don't know who the fuck knows.
All right,

1303
01:18:45.191 --> 01:18:48.310
