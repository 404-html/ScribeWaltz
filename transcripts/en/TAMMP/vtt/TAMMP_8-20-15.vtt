00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.670
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and a,
it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:09.570
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast at [inaudible].

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.010
<v 2>Ah,</v>

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.100
<v 1>um,
just checking in on you,
man.
How's your week going?
You know,</v>

5
00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:23.270
August 20th.
Holy Shit.
Where is this summer going?

6
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.300
Oh,
Billy fucking fat cakes.
Oh,

7
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:30.320
pasty tits himself is still been staying on the Diet.

8
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:35.130
I weighed myself this morning down to a buck 68 and change my head,
his schedule,

9
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.390
supposed to be a buck 68 by Sunday.
But,
uh,
I actually,

10
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:40.050
I started eating a little more pro,

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.780
actually have increased the calories because I remember a long time ago that

12
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:47.480
dude who plays wolverine in the x men,

13
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.950
he was saying like towards the end when he wanted to get completely shredded,

14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.990
like he was eating like a whole chicken every day.
So,
you know,

15
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.910
that was like probably 3.4 seconds worth of information.
So rather than going,

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.380
oh,
why don't I research that and see how to do it properly,
I just go,
oh,
okay,

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.790
okay guys playing Walter Reed and I,
I just fucking go with it.

18
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.260
So,
uh,
there was also some diet.
This,
uh,

19
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.860
this lady put me on like fucking 15 years ago and I vaguely remembered like at

20
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:21.980
four o'clock and six o'clock,
Yay to protein,

21
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.050
the size of the palm of your hand with the vegetable,

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.170
but both at four and it's six.

23
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:30.620
She kept your fruits before your fruit cakes there before 12.
I don't fucking,

24
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:34.010
all I know is it's been working for me.
He's been working for me.
So,

25
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.890
um,
I got this closet thing on the outside of the house.

26
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.270
I got this,
it,
uh,

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.450
they put a concrete floor and put some shelves up so I can get some of the shit

28
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:47.150
out of my fucking garage because I don't want to be that guy.

29
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.880
Don't be that guy with all this shit in his garage.
Right?

30
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.340
Like every time there's something,
where do we put that out?

31
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.000
Throw it in the garage,
throw it in the garage and next thing you know,
right.

32
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.850
You got it.
It's like,
looks like the beginning of Sanford and son.

33
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.760
It looks like they're fucking yard,
except they were selling the shit,

34
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:06.350
making money and I'm just,
I'm just stock piling it up.
So,
uh,

35
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.010
I got some shit.
I'm getting rid of some shit.
I'm getting given away.

36
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.680
And then I got like three boxes of DVDs just from years gone by.

37
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.550
I'm just gonna stop bringing those out to shows and was sound flag.
I Dunno what,

38
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.140
I'm a cell phone.
Just nothing.
Just to get rid of him,

39
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.060
get him out of my life and then I'll be good.
Then I'll have a nice open area.

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.190
You know,
I don't want,
I'm telling you guys this shit,
I'm fucking a,

41
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.390
I got this old bike that I bought my wife,
it's not even old.
It's nice.

42
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:38.720
She fucking used it like three times and she,
she fucked the whole thing up.

43
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.100
I don't know what she wrote it once and the gears never shifted.
Right again,

44
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.380
you know,
and I was just like,
what did you do to it?
She was like,

45
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:51.050
Tanya and that was it.
And then I've had to pay to get it fixed.

46
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.060
No rest of the time.
So anyways,
so I've telling Versie,

47
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.510
right?
I tell Versie that I'm bringing this bike over to get it fucking tuned up.

48
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.000
Then I'm going to sell it and then I'm going to buy a guy's bike.

49
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.190
And then he just starts laughing.
He goes,
I got to do a bit about that,
man.

50
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.630
He's just like,
you fucking guys who buy bikes.
He's like,

51
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:14.290
you're never going to use it.
You're never going to fucking use it.

52
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.610
And I'm just sitting there.
I'm like,
dude,
you're never going to use it.

53
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.283
You know what I mean?

54
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.220
It'd be like if you're not into cooking and somebody buys one of those fucking

55
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:28.390
things that smashes up the,
uh,
the garlic young,
you know,

56
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.520
a few fucking always order,
right?
You're like to why you buy it,

57
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.980
you're never going to use it.
It's like,
no,
dude,
you're never going to use it.

58
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.900
All right?
You're not the world.
But,
uh,
I don't know,
verse,

59
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.690
he was cracking me up today.
I was telling us that dude,
I'm down to a buck 60,
80,

60
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:45.100
cause your dad to a buck 68.
And I was like,
yeah.
He goes,
ah,
you know,
he goes,

61
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.700
you know,

62
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.090
I feel like you're like one of those still skinny Irish guys that can just

63
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:51.970
fucking eat anything,
you know?
I'm telling you right now,

64
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.260
that is the number one thing that people who are out of shape say,

65
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.520
not say versus out of shape,

66
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.510
but I've heard that for more Goddamn fatties in my lifetime.

67
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.530
They always want to say that you be you.
You know you could eat anything.

68
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.450
You know what you what your metabolism.
You can fucking eat anything.
Me,

69
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.960
you know I even look at Folk I put on weight.
Yeah,

70
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.110
you look at it and then you shove it down your fucking pie hall.

71
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.170
I love how fat and I don't want to go off on fat people,

72
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:21.640
but I'm of going to go off on him here.

73
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.820
I love how they try to act like we don't understand caloric intake.

74
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.600
Is that the right word?
I don't know.
It's like,
it's like,
dude,
I eat,

75
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.410
I eat food too.
I know what it does to me.
All right.

76
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.420
I just don't sit down with the whole fucking Bundt cake when I've had a bad day

77
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.270
and eat the whole fucking thing,
you know,

78
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.870
turning it upside down so the frosting touches my tongue rather than the roof of

79
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:51.260
my mouth so I can get more of a sugar fix,
you know?
See that I've,

80
00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:56.020
I've dabbled,
I've met that my problems.

81
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.270
Um,
they're always saying that anytime to get in shape,

82
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.130
somebody always has to say like,
you know,

83
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.630
oh that's cause you in fucking a tab.
No,
it's cause I fucking,

84
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.030
I quit Bosun I hate fucking is perfect as I could.
And I worked out to the point,

85
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:15.550
my knees are fucking killing me.
That's how I got in shape.

86
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:19.550
I right there fucking uh oh,
whatever the fuck you written there with you.

87
00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:22.270
If you're fucking blueberry muffins,
right.

88
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.390
Versus you sit there bitching and then halfway through and he tells me he

89
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.220
fucking eat a bag of gummy bears.
It's like,

90
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.940
what do you think your body does with that?
He's going like,
dude,
I can't fucking,

91
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.160
I can't get rid of my,
uh,
my stomach though.
My stomach.
That's the fucking thing.

92
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.840
I can't get rid of the stomach.
It's like,
well dude,

93
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:42.100
you put it on first there and then you take it on last.
So you,
you just got to,

94
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.630
you got to keep going.
As she fucking had them laughing.
I told him,
I said,

95
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:49.300
no Paul,
I go,
there's no difference between our metabolism.
All right,

96
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:51.910
I'm fucking 10 years older than you.
I'm 47 years old.

97
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:53.790
I don't want to hear that shit.
All right.

98
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.480
The simple fact is as I have more willpower than you and I'm,
I'm,

99
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.530
I'm way more red on nutrition and I don't know shit.

100
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.970
You know,
he actually laughed and I have to tell you right now,

101
00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:08.690
I don't know shit about nutrition.
I don't,
I,

102
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.720
I listened to shit that people say and then I try it out and if it works then I

103
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:16.480
start doing it and then I repeat it to other people as if I did.

104
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.950
I guess I did do research cause I tried to use it.
I have no fucking idea,

105
00:06:20.951 --> 00:06:24.280
but when it,
anyways,
all these fucking people,
fat people,

106
00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:26.770
women are another group of people.
They'd say say stuff,

107
00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:30.910
it's easier for a guy to Lewthwaite than it is for a woman.

108
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.220
You know?
It's like for example,
me and my boyfriend went on a diet the other day.

109
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.990
It's like two weeks later he's getting,
I barely lost any fucking wow.
Right.

110
00:06:40.991 --> 00:06:42.910
They always say that shit.
You know,

111
00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:46.250
it's cause I built from mothering where we fucking retained me to blah,
blah,

112
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:50.560
blah,
blah.
A excuses,
excuses,
excuses,

113
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.760
eat a fucking salad and get on the treadmill like the rest of us.
You know,

114
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:57.520
I think the problem with what I think with women,

115
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.980
I just felt all female listeners just tuning out at this point is that they just

116
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:04.630
do a lot more social shit.

117
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.940
<v 1>You know,
like a lot of this shit involves sitting around talking and in ordering</v>

119
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:14.930
something.
You know what I mean?
Where guys,

120
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.980
it involves a lot of standing around while drinking,
you know?

121
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:20.330
And that's the difference right there.

122
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.950
You guys sit down and you consume your calories were standing up,
you know,

123
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.120
drinking a fucking Milla.
Um,
I dunno.

124
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.030
Maybe there's elements of truth,
I guess in some,

125
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.040
some people's metabolism is faster.

126
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.930
I imagine there's some element of truth of women having a little more difficult

127
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:39.764
time,

128
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.640
but I've never seen anybody that fucking worked out and ate right and did not

129
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:46.360
look good.
I can honestly tell you that there's,

130
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.990
I've never seen somebody go and like,

131
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:52.991
I'm eating Kale Salads and apples and for some reason I'm 350 pounds.

132
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:53.990
It's like,
well,

133
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.520
when you want to be honest about the other truck load of horse shit yet throwing

134
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.970
down your fucking throat when nobody's around,

135
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.293
<v 0>you know,</v>

136
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.911
<v 1>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>

137
00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:09.420
I'm just saying I don't fucking buy into fat people,
women,

138
00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:13.950
or just some pudgy guys.
Horseshit lie about your fucking metabolism.

139
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.780
You know what I mean?
Sitting around eating gummy bears and cakes.

140
00:08:18.781 --> 00:08:21.960
You probably put your public,
they've put gummy bears on cakes,
don't they?

141
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.400
Big gummy bear cake.

142
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.400
And then you shove that down your fucking throat and then the next day you have

143
00:08:26.401 --> 00:08:28.800
some oatmeal and,
and you think that that's going to give you abs.

144
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.180
I'm really being a fucking judgmental country,
Ernie.
Well,
that's what I do.

145
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.340
It is what I do when I'm on the fucking podcast.
Um,

146
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.620
so anyways,
I got,
oh,
uh,
what am I trying to say here?

147
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:46.780
I just realized I don't have my computer here and I don't have any of the

148
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:49.480
fucking subjects,
anything that I wanted to talk about.
Oh,

149
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:53.950
I'm going to be on Conan O'brien tonight and I actually planned on talking about

150
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:57.430
Tom Brady.
We just never to,
it fucking killed me.

151
00:08:57.431 --> 00:09:01.300
I want to call Jim or a baby on that show and I think,
I can't believe I didn't.

152
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.020
But anyways,
that's going to be on tonight.
Uh,

153
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.090
it's a fucking monster shelf bonds to goddamn shelf.
Uh,

154
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.600
go,
going to go on.
I have to fucking bill Hader.

155
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.360
And he went out destroying as always just one of those things where you sit in

156
00:09:19.361 --> 00:09:23.110
there going like,
why am I going on it?
So this guy I should be going on for us.

157
00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:27.670
But then how those shows work,
it's like he's got a movie coming out,
right?
Oh,

158
00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:31.750
he's got that thing coming out with Fred Armisen.
Well they dress like Quakers.

159
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.870
I don't,
I don't know.
I didn't know what the fucking shows about.

160
00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:37.810
All I know is I'm watching it because those two are hilarious.

161
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:40.520
But he was promoting that thing and I don't know.

162
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.560
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So let,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

163
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.290
hang on.
Hang on.
You know I'm gonna do,

164
00:09:47.291 --> 00:09:50.830
I'm gonna go get my fucking computer cause I actually have to have the

165
00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:52.900
advertising and all that and through the magic,

166
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.220
through the absolute fucking magic of me hitting the pause button.

167
00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:00.580
I'll be back in half a second.
All right.
Just like dad,

168
00:10:00.581 --> 00:10:02.580
I'm back and I get something to talk about.
Dude.

169
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.770
What the fuck happened to the guy who did the subway things?

170
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.230
Jared says he fides middle school girls hot.

171
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

172
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.870
<v 1>Some chick was taping them for fucking four years.
He's caused a lot of pain.</v>

173
00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:19.820
It's pain that will never go away.

174
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.480
What for saying that now he must have gone a little further than that on

175
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:23.991
Wednesday.

176
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:28.991
Follow admitted that he had sex with at least two minors and obtain child

177
00:10:30.071 --> 00:10:34.160
profile,
not pornography of 12 other children as young as six years old.

178
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.640
A boy.
Dude,
is anything buddy safe?

179
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.330
Can anybody go wire to wire without the fucking hammer coming down?

180
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.940
Jared Fogle was a monster.
He's a monster.
That's what she said.

181
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.973
<v 0>Okay.</v>

182
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.380
<v 1>How funny is it that I was just talking to you guys about eating right and</v>

183
00:10:56.381 --> 00:10:59.260
getting in shape and I go look at Google fucking news.

184
00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:01.900
So I got some that run my Goddamn Yap about yes,

185
00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.320
Jesus Christ.
And he looks like Derosa.

186
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.690
That's fucking hilarious.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

187
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.140
Fogo served as subway spokesman for 15 years.

188
00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:21.530
Ever since he first appeared on television claiming that eating the fast food

189
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:26.450
chains sandwiches and working out helped them lose more than 200 pounds.
Please.

190
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.470
He probably likes that money running out the back door when the parents came up.

191
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.270
See,
this is dumb.
I shouldn't be doing this.

192
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:33.830
This guy has not been convicted of anything.

193
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

194
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.710
<v 1>Oh,
but he's completely fucked.
He better had done it.
I mean,</v>

195
00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:40.660
I hope he didn't for kids' sake,
but I mean,

196
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.990
he's fucked now it's over.
What's it?
You're going to go over the Blimpie?

197
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.920
Yeah.
Hey everybody.
I'm wrongly accused,
accused a child molester,

198
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.170
Jared Fogle and a,

199
00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:57.120
I'm going to tell you that a Blimpie's makes you even more skinny.

200
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

201
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.760
<v 1>And what the stress is sitting there,
uh,
you know,</v>

202
00:12:01.761 --> 00:12:04.820
thinking I was going to go to jail for that Shit and get gang raped.

203
00:12:04.821 --> 00:12:08.390
Cause that's what happened.
God,
Jared,
Jared,
what did you do?

204
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.800
Oh my God.
If he,
if he fucking did this shit and he's guilty,
he goes to jail.

205
00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:16.230
Do you have any fucking idea what's going?

206
00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:19.290
I love that they put them in protective custody for how fucking long,

207
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.873
you know what I mean?

208
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

209
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.020
<v 1>Figure maybe eight,
10 years.
He's fucked.
Literally.
Oh my God.</v>

210
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.630
They'll descend on a May.
Jerry,
what do you want the six of the 12 inch?

211
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.620
God,
I fucking kill myself.
Oh,

212
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:42.090
there's gotta be a way to do it is to fucking skinny now to hang himself.

213
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.560
Just sit there and twitching around like a fucking God damn fly.

214
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:47.880
They've got its wings ripped off.

215
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.510
How do you kill yourself when you're shaped like a pencil?
Oh God.

216
00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:56.810
What do you do?
Oh,
I know.
I do.
I fucking break my glasses and I jam.

217
00:12:56.811 --> 00:13:01.050
One of the pieces in my neck just bleed out in the cell.
There you go.
Let's see.

218
00:13:01.051 --> 00:13:03.810
There's always a way.
You know that you put somebody in a confined area there.

219
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.010
They're going to come up with something.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

220
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.860
I don't understand why before the guy's convicted that his face is all over the

221
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:16.694
fucking place.

222
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.530
I don't get it because if this guy didn't do this shit,
it was like,

223
00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:24.320
what the fuck I was talking about last week about the hockey player there.

224
00:13:24.321 --> 00:13:27.920
It's like if they didn't do it,
they completely fucked fucked.
Either way.

225
00:13:27.921 --> 00:13:31.220
Either they did it and they go into jail and getting gang raped.
You know what's,

226
00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:35.330
you know let's what you get for doing that shit.
But on the other side,

227
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.360
if you did do whatever,
you know,
what do,
what are you,

228
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.280
how do you make your money then?
I Dunno.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Wow.

229
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

230
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.440
<v 1>Jeb Bush.
Donald Trump,
unapologetic for anchor baby language.</v>

231
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.700
I gotta I gotta be honest with you as far as like,
you know,
offensive shit.

232
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:59.430
Anchor baby.
That's good.
That's pretty fucking light.
You know what I mean?

233
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:04.110
There's no racial epitaphs and there is nothing homophobic anchor baby.

234
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.800
It's the baby that gets you in here.
You don't,
you put down roots.
Right?

235
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.500
How about a root baby?
[inaudible] baby,
I

236
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:18.180
hate that fucking report to you.
Generally.
Would you fish?
Shut the fuck up.

237
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.940
You're offensive.
You fucking cunt.

238
00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:24.750
You work for some corporate Goddamn News News.
Fucking paper.

239
00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:27.300
Quit acting like you're giving out the facts.
You jerk off.

240
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.350
You write about what they tell you to write about.

241
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.130
That's what you should have done.
You write what they tell you to write about.

242
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.130
Then you go on your cash,
those checks don't Ya.

243
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.700
And you got to go buy yourself an Audi,
right?
Or a BMW,

244
00:14:38.701 --> 00:14:42.720
some German sedan that lets the bras.
No,
you're fucking,
you know,

245
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:45.580
you're on the Dole.
Um,

246
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.110
you gotta be fucking kidding me,
man.
Jesus Christ.

247
00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:53.770
If you can't trust a form of fuck fat who's eaten sandwiches to be around your

248
00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:55.540
kids,
honestly,
who can you trust?

249
00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.500
That would been a great fucking segue to go into my advertising.

250
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:04.400
Where the fuck is it?
Oh,
it's here.
Yeah.
Jesus.

251
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.720
Everything's just falling apart on me here.
All right.

252
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.600
It's time for some advertising.
I mean,
what else?

253
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:10.970
What else do you do after you talk about the form of fat?
Fuck.

254
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:15.260
Who became a skinny guy and then uh,
allegedly

255
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.970
Jesus Christ.
I get,
wow.
Anyways,

256
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.480
I don't fuck you think you're going to get away with something like that?
Um,

257
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.353
all right.

258
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

259
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.830
<v 1>Be One thing.
If you were the spokesperson for Wendy's,
like that old guy,</v>

260
00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:34.450
then he could just say,
Nah,
no,
I was just dressed as Santa.
All right.
It's okay.

261
00:15:34.451 --> 00:15:37.690
All right.
Let's,
what do we got here?
What am I reading here?
Is it Oxford?

262
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.330
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

263
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.310
<v 1>Oh,
blue apron.
It's okay.</v>

264
00:15:42.311 --> 00:15:45.820
You can admit the last thing anyone wants to do after work is wait in line at

265
00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:46.720
the grocery store,

266
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.950
Schlep home and cook a complicated meal and expensive,

267
00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:52.910
unhealthy takeout is hardly any,

268
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.923
<v 3>right?</v>

269
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.740
<v 1>That's where the new service blue apron comes in.
Why is the apron blue?</v>

270
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.880
I don't know.

271
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.310
Blue Apron delivers farm fresh ingredients and step by step recipes to your
home,

276
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.010

American league ace is the Yag gauge.
Um,

368
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.000
I got some new kid.

369
00:21:44.001 --> 00:21:46.850
He of the night something bird.

I got all this extra shit in my garage.
Like,

381
00:22:20.161 --> 00:22:24.600
I have like half cans a Turpentine and all this crap leftover from when they

382
00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:28.530
were redoing the bottom of the,
of my piece of shit.
Fucking tree fort of a house,

383
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.870

Okay.
But now we're doing the upstairs because uh,
you know,</v>

386
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.880
all the wiring was put in by Herman Munster in the fucking Jesus Christ.

387
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.180
And I want to get into it.
I have fucking holes in my walls again because,
uh,

388
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.530

all they have to say is,
I don't know.
Pipe looks a little old.

389
00:22:50.531 --> 00:22:53.890
And after this shit I went through,
I'm just like,
oh,
whoa,
whoa.
It's sex.

390
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:57.790
All of it.
And that's what they've been doing.
So I have pretty much,

391
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.050
I have copper pipes going through almost all of the house and now they're

392
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:04.420
talking about the sink.
Well,
you know,

393
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:06.910
we could go through a wall and the catch it at this fucking,

394
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.390
is that what you could do?
Is that what you get though?
Just fucking do it.

395
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.490
Cut The fucking thing open and get it done with.

396
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.760
I feel like I've been having open heart surgery on this Goddamn fucking house.

397
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.330
Ah,
what a dope.
What kind of a fucking dope buys a fucking house.

398
00:23:23.331 --> 00:23:27.440
That's 90 years old and is in a state in the middle of a drought.
Good move bill.

399
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.650
Wait at golf.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.360
you said the second grade book of all time is his book,
the art of the deal.

402
00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.230
And then the right behind the Bible,
the guy,

403
00:23:42.231 --> 00:23:45.650
he's crushing it as far as the one liners,
the guy,
he's a quote machine.

404
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.790
He's like rex.
Rex Ryan ran for president that actually had money.

405
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.290
You know.
Oh,
by the way,
I saw this thing on real sports.

406
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:58.670
It was really passive aggressive by that fucking tool shed.

407
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:03.030
Bryant Bryant Gumbel,
I'm gonna sit Bryant gumball.

408
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.990
you know the fucking,
they come back to him,
right?

409
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:10.040
And he's got his little clipboard of questions and he's like,
Oh,
you know,

410
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:13.160
he's always fucking,
whenever you got the question,
his voice goes really high.

411
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.690
Ooh.
And,
um,
he fucking,
uh,

412
00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.280
they were doing a story on Rex Ryan and he,
this is what he said.
He said,

413
00:24:22.281 --> 00:24:26.150
most coaches are stoic,

414
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.660
like Tom Kauflin or socially inept control freaks like bill Belicheck,

415
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.770
you know,
but not outspoken,

416
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:40.730
Brash Rex Ryan that was so fucking passive aggressive.
What,

417
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:44.870
that everybody in the media hates bill Belicheck because he won't talk to him.

418
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.790
You talked to the Patriots.

419
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:49.970
They say he's fucking hilarious and he has a great personality.

420
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.360
That shit that he does is no different than what shack did.

421
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.600
Shack in the beginning of his career would fuck around.

422
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:59.600
And then he realized what Consta fucking media was.
And it's all right.

423
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:03.020
I'm not giving you anything because it just motivates the other team.

424
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.420
That's what Bella check does.
That's why Gig Shack,

425
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.170
if you see him do an MTV cribs,
he's got this amazing personality.

426
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.760
You watch him do the fucking commentating in between the fucking the haves.

427
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.420
He's fucking hilarious.
Totally outgoing.
If you watch him during his career,

428
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.720
he's just like,
where are we going to ball Colby?
Colby?
Good me.
Uh,

429
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.910
through row,
he'll do the layup,
try to scroll of bullet points of him.

430
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.120
That's all one want good.
Still lead with three more.
That's all he would do.

431
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.300
All he was doing,
you get them on MTV cribs.
He's a fucking riot.

432
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.660
Thrown his kids around on his giant bed.
Right?

433
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.230
That's the same thing with Bellacheck.
Bellicheck just goes out there,
you know,

434
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.860
hey,
you play in this piece of shit team next week and that's going to be an easy

435
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:49.970
win,
right?
And not going to be easy.
And he just goes,
wow.
You know,
say,
yeah,

436
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.590
see NFL,

437
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.250
every team has a worthy opponent and we're not looking past them himself.

438
00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:01.310
All we're focused on right now is trying to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars.

439
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.390
And then they get mad because it's just like,
I,
you didn't say something crazy,

440
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.120
you know,
this sniffing feet.
You know what I mean?

441
00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:10.670
You're not predicting that you're going to win the fucking super bowl.

442
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.690
And they actually,
this is what kills me.
So they fucking,

443
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.150
they say that he's socially inept and a control freak and then they say,

444
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:22.490
Rex Ryan is super confident.

445
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.980
And then they're talking about when he was the kid,

446
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.870
how he was unbelievably insecure and kids picked on him and all that.

447
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:35.840
And it's showing pictures of him when he's like a,
like 11 to 12 it's like,

448
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:38.000
that shit doesn't go away.
You're still that guy.

449
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.820
You're just that guy and you weigh 200 more pounds.
That's all.

450
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.860
But having said all that,
I'm psyched.
He fucking lost the weight.
You know,

451
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.430
he looks great and I think he's going to do real well out in buffalo with that

452
00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:51.660
defense sets the exact fucking team that he should be coaching.

453
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:54.900
He did great with the jets when the jets had a defense and I think that's a

454
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:57.960
fucking home run.
But he's got the same problem,

455
00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:01.890
I think maybe not as bad that he had in New York,

456
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:06.300
which he has nobody at the quarterback position.
So call me crazy,

457
00:27:06.301 --> 00:27:09.870
but I just say it's going to be more the same.
I think he's going to talk shit.

458
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.240
He's going to say that they're going to win the,

459
00:27:11.241 --> 00:27:13.080
you already said that they're gonna make the playoffs.

460
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.000
I think they're going to do well.

461
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:19.560
And then some guys are going to want to get more money and when their contract

462
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.131
gets up,

463
00:27:20.131 --> 00:27:24.450
they want to fucking play in a warmer place with more media attention and then

464
00:27:24.451 --> 00:27:26.940
they're going to leave and he's going to be left with no fucking quarterback.

465
00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:31.500
Had No defense.
And that's how that's going to go.
You know,
who knows?

466
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.310
I'm not saying he's a bad coach,
I'm just predicting he's going to get fired.

467
00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.920
What I kind of,
um,
either way I'm looking forward to it.
Um,

468
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.630
can't wait for football season.
CanNot fucking wait.

469
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:50.130
So is the deal.
I,
um,
we're going to be going to that Texas Longhorn,

470
00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.660
a Oklahoma state,
uh,
football games.

471
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.500
We do that run through Texas.
And then,
um,

472
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:04.590
I got another run towards the end of October where I'm going through the Midwest

473
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.960
and now trying to find games.
Weekend,
I'm in Chicago.

474
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.760
Northwestern has a road game.
Illinois has a fucking road game.

475
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.410
Then I looked,
I fucking,
Purdue was home.
Iowa was home,

476
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.990
but then I was like,
come on man,
there's gotta be,

477
00:28:21.991 --> 00:28:24.930
there's gotta be a fucking game close by.

478
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:28.050
And then I looked like three days before the tour starts.

479
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.460
Notre Dame play in USC at Notre Dame.

480
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.111
So,
uh,

481
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:37.680
I might be adding a couple extra standup dates and maybe going to try to go to

482
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:40.470
that model.
We'll see.
That's an outside chance.
But if I'm not,

483
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.310
I think I'm going to go to that Purdue game after I do the Chicago theater.

484
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:47.030
We're going to go drive over there playing Nebraska.
Uh,

485
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.850
I've always liked Purdue in Nebraska was a fucking power house when I was a kid.

486
00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.410
Um,
Irving Fryer,
Mike Rozier,
Turner Gill,

487
00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.830
I almost said Jimmy Johnson coached him,

488
00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.840
but each coast ti coach that Miami team that beat Nebraska and that amazing

489
00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:07.920
championship game,
I believe the fuck was it coach.

490
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.280
I can't remember.
But they just had,
they just had one hall of fame,

491
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:16.260
offensive Lineman after another when I was coming up and they used to just be

492
00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:17.460
like,
I remember when you get those,

493
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:21.990
those football cards that were just for skill,
just like a,

494
00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:24.840
that fucking a draft kings,
right.
Just for skill.

495
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.850
And that was back when you could actually bet on Games,
um,

496
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.160
where the spread was like 70 points.

497
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.660
So you'd be sitting there and every week,
like you just,

498
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.100
you just bet against Nebraska,
you had to,
you were getting like 65,

499
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.020
70 points and we'd all be at school laughing,
just going,

500
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.660
how do you lay off this game?
It's like you're up 70 to nothing already.

501
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.210
Um,
you know,

502
00:29:53.211 --> 00:29:56.780
and use banking on the fact that they'll score 50 early and then put their

503
00:29:56.781 --> 00:30:00.230
scrubs in and not going to,
it's not going to happen.
And these fucking assholes,

504
00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:04.670
Nebraska,
they used to cover,
they used to cover and we hated losing money,

505
00:30:04.671 --> 00:30:08.030
but we just thought it was the funniest fucking thing ever.
You know,

506
00:30:08.031 --> 00:30:10.040
losing money sucks,
but losing money that way,

507
00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:13.130
that's just something hilarious about it.
Um,

508
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.880
and then you'd end up losing your bed and then just rooting for them to go for

509
00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:21.410
two points and try to somehow score a hundred.
But,
uh,
but anyways,

510
00:30:21.411 --> 00:30:25.550
so we're going to be going to that game,
possibly the,
the,
uh,

511
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.520
the Notre Dame game.
And I might even in November,

512
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.600
I got another road gig that they,
and there's a chance,

513
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.320
<v 0>mmm.</v>

514
00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.430
<v 1>Oh miss and Lsu a play.
And I might be able to,
that'd be three in one year.</v>

515
00:30:38.431 --> 00:30:42.300
That'd be fucking sick.
So that's what I'm working towards.

516
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:47.170
That's what I'm working towards,
if you can believe it.
Um,
anyways,
so how,

517
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.690
I feel like there was something else I want to tell you.

518
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.040
I'm going to be on Conan.

519
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.933
<v 0>MMM.</v>

520
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.230
<v 1>I think that's it.
I'm going to be uncommon and that's it.
I'm calling it tonight.</v>

521
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.560
Check it out.
It's a,
what am I trying to say here?
Oh,

522
00:31:01.561 --> 00:31:02.530
so tonight,
uh,

523
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:07.550
the guests are bill Hader then myself and this hilarious comic sans moral and

524
00:31:08.191 --> 00:31:11.490
everybody,
you know,
it's actually a fucking great show to be honest with you.

525
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:15.870
So tune in if he can,
you know,
try to watch it live.
Sit through the commercials,

526
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.800
you know,
I know nobody does anymore,
but anyways,

527
00:31:19.801 --> 00:31:23.850
that's the Thursday afternoon podcast.
Uh,
have a great weekend,

528
00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:25.880
your cuts and uh,
talk to you on Monday.

529
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:26.963
<v 4>Okay.</v>

530
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.640
<v 5>Uh,
all right.
I know this girl,
I've known her for a bit.</v>

531
00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:12.350
Uh,
we're friends.
We've been for awhile.
Okay.
Now this one,

532
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.140
you know how everybody always trashes me for the way I fucking read.

533
00:32:15.141 --> 00:32:17.090
I know I suck at reading,
but I have to let you know.

534
00:32:17.091 --> 00:32:21.320
This is all in lowercase and there's absolutely no punctuation whatsoever.

535
00:32:21.321 --> 00:32:24.290
I don't know if this guy text message this or what,

536
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.790
but this is not my fucking fault.
Let me try my best to read this.
All right,
Bill.

537
00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:32.090
I know this girl.
I've known her for a bit and we're friends.
No period.

538
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.320
We've been for a while,
comma.
Anyway,

539
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:41.180
about a month ago,
I asked her out on a date and she said yes,
comma,

540
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.370
continuing the sentence.
He doesn't have periods.
He just has calm is lowercase.

541
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.820
I took her out and we had fun.
No period.
We talked.
Shit

542
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.330
was Hunky Dory.
No Comma,
we kissed it.
No period.
It was awesome.

543
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.370
First date,
it was an awesome first date.
Hey,
there's a period,

544
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.390
no capital letter.
Then I,

545
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.030
I barely fucking heard from her.
No.
Period.

546
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:11.810
I was running around like a fucking jackass.
No period.

547
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.920
Just trying to talk to her and I'm sorry.
I guess it keeps going.

548
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:18.740
Just trying to talk to her and when we would talk it was fine.

549
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.720
Now there's a period I was beating myself up going crazy.

550
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.890
No,
period.
I was some piece of shit.

551
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.630
Anyway,
I pulled myself together and I asked her out again.

552
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.990
She wants against said yes.
Awesome.
Right.

553
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.590
Well not your fucking lack of punctuation.
That's not awesome.

554
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:45.170
So we go out again when cool.
Again,
I didn't kiss her this time.
I don't know.

555
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.740
It was just off.
But anyway,
comma,

556
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.420
that was no punctuation and all of that.
You fucking Dick.
Once again,

557
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:58.220
I was fucking,
once again,
I fucking didn't hear a thing,

558
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.380
so I said,
fuck it.
I don't need this right now.

559
00:34:01.381 --> 00:34:06.050
And we just went back to being friends,
never talked about it.
Just let it lay.

560
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.380
Fucking see double at this point.
Anyway,
lately I've been talking to her a lot.

561
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:15.530
Like I said,
like I said,
we're friends,

562
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:19.190
but she's very clearly been flirting with me and I honestly have been flirting

563
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:23.150
back.
I still like the girl,
no period,
no nothing,

564
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.430
but I just don't know if it's worth it.
You know,

565
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:31.820
period.
No question mark.
She's got a lot of drama.

566
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:35.120
She's one of these girls that gets drunk at a party and cries.

567
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:36.920
Then ask people if she's pretty,

568
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.830
which she really fucking is like really hot dot,
dot,
dot,
dot,
dot.

569
00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.660
Ah,
but I do like her,

570
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:47.510
I just don't know if I should put myself through this shit again.

571
00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:50.690
What do you think bill?
I legitimate legitimately,

572
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.190
we'd like your advice slash opinion.
Um,
okay.

573
00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:57.660
The first thing I would do,
I would get some sort of spell check.

574
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.420
I would get some sort of,
uh,
um,

575
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.450
phonics or some sort of shit to teach you how to write.
All right?

576
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:09.200
People I know I suck at reading out loud,
but can,
can you do me a fucking solid?

577
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.060
I'm not reading any more fucking emails that are like this.
All right?
Cause I,

578
00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:18.920
this is literally,
if I'm,
I'm starting to lose my fucking eyesight.
Um,

579
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.940
so what do I think?
Yeah.
Okay.
This is what I think.

580
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:25.700
I think you should definitely not get into a relationship with this girl,

581
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:28.580
this girl that this girl is a fucking nightmare.
All right?

582
00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:29.930
There's all kinds of red flags.

583
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.240
I don't know what happened to her and I can tell you right now,

584
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.120
you don't want to find out what's happening to her,
what happened to her.

585
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:40.010
You don't want to find out in that you don't want to have feelings for this
girl.

586
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.061
All right?

587
00:35:41.061 --> 00:35:46.061
And when the other fucking bag of shit hits the floor and your heart is

588
00:35:46.851 --> 00:35:49.610
underneath that,
you don't.
You don't.
You don't let it grow like this.

589
00:35:49.611 --> 00:35:52.250
Break your heart.
All right?
You can see it from a mile away.

590
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.170
She is a fucking mess.

591
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.430
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

592
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.210
<v 5>All right.
There's plenty of great girls out there.
You're a young guy.</v>

593
00:35:58.211 --> 00:36:03.070
Go find one.
All right.
Find a girl,
you know,
make a list of shit.

594
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.260
All right?
One of the big things,

595
00:36:06.261 --> 00:36:10.970
if you want to find a really good girl is find one who has a great relationship

596
00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:14.690
with her parents.
Hopefully they're still together.
All right?

597
00:36:14.691 --> 00:36:17.350
That's another good thing.
Start with that,
but does this,
and then

598
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:22.310
they got low self esteem issues.
You're going to kill a decade,

599
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.270
a your fucking life trying to build them up and you know what it's going to be,

600
00:36:26.271 --> 00:36:29.570
it's going to be fucking exhausting.
All right?
And then,

601
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.520
because she doesn't think she's pretty,
she might act out sexually,
um,

602
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:38.120
for some sort of,
you know,
I don't know,
like,

603
00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.290
Geez,
I just really,
I'm an hour and six minutes in here,
just,
you know,

604
00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:45.050
some sort of affirmation that she is pretty okay.

605
00:36:45.051 --> 00:36:48.890
So what do I think you should do?
All right,
well,
if you're a well adjusted guy,

606
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:52.770
you'll just walk away from the situation and say that I'm not going to just bang

607
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:55.280
her and use that as a fucking Nacho.

608
00:36:55.281 --> 00:36:58.700
My bedpost to make my ego feel good and I'm not going to hurt this person.

609
00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:03.950
But if you're,
how most people are your age,
I would just say bang her and then,

610
00:37:03.951 --> 00:37:08.560
uh,
I dunno,
it's,
it's going to be ugly.

611
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.300
If you want to bang this girl,
I got to tell you,

612
00:37:10.301 --> 00:37:12.650
don't let your heart get involved at,
uh,

613
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.593
<v 6>I dunno.</v>

614
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:21.100
<v 5>Not,
not having seen her,
not seeing how she is and being older and more mature,</v>

615
00:37:21.101 --> 00:37:25.420
I would say just walk away and go find some,
well adjusted hottie that's,

616
00:37:25.421 --> 00:37:29.110
unless you just want a bank.
So buddy,
but then you,
you can do that.

617
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.490
You know what it is about this thing?
You know what?

618
00:37:30.491 --> 00:37:34.360
I don't like this too much fucking history.
You got to be able to leave.

619
00:37:34.361 --> 00:37:37.750
You gotta be able to fucking go out the side door.

620
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.380
If you just going to bank somebody,
you can't have this.
Well,

621
00:37:41.381 --> 00:37:44.140
we were friends at first and then it became romantic.

622
00:37:44.141 --> 00:37:46.570
Then we went back to being friends and then we fucked.

623
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.160
And it's just a fucking nightmare.
Yeah,
I'd find someone else to fuck.

624
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.290
But if you don't give a shit,
yeah,
I banger.

625
00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.280
But by no means don't develop any sort of feelings for her.

626
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:59.750
<v 4>Alright,
there you go.
That's my advice.</v>

627
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.450
Yay.

628
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.280
Got Your Bill.

629
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:51.260
<v 5>Recently I had to return some items at the mall.
Uh,</v>

630
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:55.000
it was the day after Christmas and I was with a girl.
I was dating,
uh,

631
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.930
with the girl that I was dating.
She wanted to return some shoes.

632
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.500
So we went to the journey store with his shoes were,

633
00:39:01.501 --> 00:39:05.940
but uh,
when she got to the counter to return the shoes,

634
00:39:05.941 --> 00:39:10.080
the girl behind the counter asked her for her name,
address,
email,

635
00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:13.350
and phone number.
Oh my God.

636
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.080
The amount of fucking people who actually give out that information.

637
00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:20.700
My girlfriend just gave the information over.
As soon as the girl asked for it,

638
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.680
we were leaving the store.

639
00:39:22.681 --> 00:39:25.770
I remarked that I thought it was bullshit that she had to give away personal

640
00:39:25.771 --> 00:39:30.570
information to return a pair of shoes.
She said,
uh,
it was not a big deal,

641
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.940
but I didn't like it.
All right.

642
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.800
Why the fuck would you give somebody all in information and just in case you're

643
00:39:37.801 --> 00:39:40.800
new to my podcast,
just say you can say no.

644
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:42.840
<v 4>Okay.</v>

645
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.730
<v 5>Can I,
you know,
I,
I go out to buy shit all the time.</v>

646
00:39:44.731 --> 00:39:46.320
Could I have your phone number?
No.

647
00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.193
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

648
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.700
<v 5>I don't even say,
I don't even try and make it nice.</v>

649
00:39:50.701 --> 00:39:55.180
I just say no and then they go,
oh,
okay.
You know,

650
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.200
why do you feel like you got to give them their information?

651
00:39:57.201 --> 00:40:00.200
You're trying to buy something.
I'm sorry I can't,

652
00:40:00.201 --> 00:40:02.240
I can't show you this unless I get your information.

653
00:40:02.241 --> 00:40:05.600
Well they go fuck yourself applied somewhere else.

654
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.460
I don't even need it anyways.
So anyways,
he goes,
next,

655
00:40:10.461 --> 00:40:14.060
we go to American Eagle.
You guys hit all the hot spot,
Huh?

656
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.860
Then we went to Cinnabon.

657
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.330
Next we went to American Eagle where I had to return a shirt.
That was a gift.

658
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.090
It was a long line for returns.

659
00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:27.140
Why'd you return the shirt and did it not fit or was it ugly as hell or was it

660
00:40:27.141 --> 00:40:29.180
both?
As I was waiting in line,

661
00:40:29.181 --> 00:40:32.690
one of the employees comes up to me with a clipboard with the little form to

662
00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:36.680
fill out now.
Is anybody else kind of getting the prison camp vibe here?

663
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.233
You know,

664
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.880
they're standing in line to get processed and there's a guy coming up onto the

665
00:40:41.881 --> 00:40:46.040
VAT.
Is Your name please?
Your phone number?
Uh,

666
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.810
I stopped the employee.
Uh,

667
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.900
I stopped the employee and asked her why she needed this information and she

668
00:40:52.941 --> 00:40:57.770
says that it was to verify my purchase.
How fucking dumb our people.

669
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.150
You're going to verify my purchase.
Well,
here's the sales slips there,
sweetheart.

670
00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.200
This verifies it.
That's it.

671
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.930
I don't know what to tell you.
Why don't you and your clipboard?

672
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.110
Why don't you hold that clipboard between your little fucking beef curtains and

673
00:41:13.111 --> 00:41:16.230
take a fucking walk down the street?
How about that?
How sweetheart there,

674
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.250
there's the reasons you use that type of language.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Huh?

675
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.860
How about I fucking grabbed that pony tail and just,
no,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,

676
00:41:25.861 --> 00:41:28.480
let's keep it clean this week,
shall we?
People anyway,
she,

677
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.750
he goes before I could protest further,

678
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.710
she said that I could just put name on it.

679
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.433
<v 6>Okay.</v>

680
00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.780
<v 5>Oh,
on the clipboard.</v>

681
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.690
<v 6>Okay.</v>

682
00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.200
<v 5>When she walked away,
I pulled out the gift receipt has said to my girlfriend,
oh,</v>

683
00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:46.140
here it is.
You have,
this is what verifies my purchase.
Exactly.

684
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:51.750
The clipboard employee wasn't as far as way as I thought she was and heard me

685
00:41:51.751 --> 00:41:54.330
say,
did I read that wrong?

686
00:41:54.331 --> 00:41:56.820
Get heard me say it's heard me say this.

687
00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:01.380
And she began to explain further why I needed to give over the information.

688
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.760
This is the part of the email I hate.
He goes,
I apologized and told her.

689
00:42:05.761 --> 00:42:09.900
I realized it wasn't her and that it was just her company's policy that she was

690
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:13.080
enforcing.
She walked away again.
I felt bad.

691
00:42:13.081 --> 00:42:15.240
So the next time I saw her I apologized and said,

692
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.760
I realized that she was just doing her job,
but she ignored me.

693
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.240
She was probably pissed because it was the day after Christmas and I was causing

694
00:42:21.241 --> 00:42:25.710
your grief,
but you could at least accept my apology.
You Bitch.
Um,

695
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:29.730
I love how you go from being totally liberal and seeing somebody fucking side of

696
00:42:29.731 --> 00:42:33.540
it too,
being yeah,
man up,
you can't.
Um,
anyway,

697
00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:36.900
I got up to the counter and there wasn't any further problems.

698
00:42:36.901 --> 00:42:40.350
The guy at the register just took my name and didn't ask me for anything.

699
00:42:40.351 --> 00:42:43.620
I felt as though I had a small victory against the big corporations.

700
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.550
Then this week I had to go back to the store to return a hat my girlfriend got.

701
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:52.230
Did you guys not make Christmas lists or all your relatives blind?

702
00:42:52.231 --> 00:42:55.320
The seems to be a lot of,
uh,
returning of gifts.

703
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:57.390
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

704
00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.570
<v 5>This is hilarious.
You're returning a hat that your girlfriend got you dude.</v>

705
00:43:00.571 --> 00:43:04.920
How horrific was that hat?
Can you please send me a picture of it before I,

706
00:43:04.921 --> 00:43:09.020
if you took one before you returned it?
Picture one of those,
uh,

707
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:13.200
plaid Charlie Chaplin Hat.
Um,
I had the receipt,
but again,

708
00:43:13.201 --> 00:43:16.710
the girl at the register asked me for my address and phone number.

709
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.490
I said I didn't want to give that information to her immediately panic sets in

710
00:43:20.491 --> 00:43:23.130
and her face and she says that I have to,

711
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.660
I said that I didn't have to the day after Christmas and I wasn't going to now,

712
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:28.523
good for you.

713
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:33.450
She calls over a coworker and they both get defensive and hold to the idea that

714
00:43:33.451 --> 00:43:37.260
I have to give over my information in order to return a stupid hat.

715
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:41.490
Even though I had my receipt,
I asked why and they let me slide.

716
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.760
Why the let me slide on this before and they maintained that I had,

717
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.370
I had to give them my name,
address and phone number.

718
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.520
So what did I do in the face of corporate opposition?

719
00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:55.870
I caved and I gave it to him.
You Fuck?

720
00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.230
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

721
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.380
<v 5>Dude.
The second you saw the panic on their face,</v>

722
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.900
you knew that they were going to lose.
All right.
He goes,

723
00:44:07.901 --> 00:44:11.830
I just don't get it,
Bill.
Why is a receipt not enough?
Nowadays it is enough.

724
00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:16.300
They say they need our personal information to verify purchase then not,
dude,

725
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:20.920
they're not.
All right.
All of that shit.

726
00:44:20.921 --> 00:44:24.660
All those little save,
you know,
you want to get one our discount store,

727
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.380
they're creating a file on you.
They figure out what you want to buy,

728
00:44:29.381 --> 00:44:30.760
what they can market towards you,

729
00:44:30.761 --> 00:44:34.620
and then take that information and they sell it to other fucking companies.

730
00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:37.560
Even though they say they're not going to,
they sell your information,

731
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.660
your information gets up on the Internet.

732
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:43.530
And that's why there's all these creepy websites out there right now that have

733
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:46.140
all this fucking information about you,
about,
you know,

734
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.560
how many siblings you have,
your brothers and sisters names,

735
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:52.530
they all use that information to fucking,
it's,
I'm telling you,

736
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:54.690
<v 6>okay,</v>

737
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.210
<v 5>this don't give them your information.</v>

738
00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.800
You don't have to give him your information and people out there

739
00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.580
who just have this fucking attitude towards these corporations just sitting

740
00:45:07.581 --> 00:45:10.450
there going like,
wait,
you know what we do?
What are they going to be?

741
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.230
As long as you're not doing anything wrong.
I mean,

742
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.750
what do I care if they know where I live?

743
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.010
What do I keep this fucking morons?

744
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.600
I don't even,

745
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:24.080
I have explained this shit till I'm blue in the face and then I always get these

746
00:45:24.081 --> 00:45:28.920
emails from these people.
Um,
they just,
I don't know.

747
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.661
I don't know.
I can't,

748
00:45:29.661 --> 00:45:32.470
if I said something the other day I was sitting there listening.

749
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.150
I was sitting there,
I was listening to us sports radio,
you know,

750
00:45:35.151 --> 00:45:39.620
cause I'm a deep thinker.
All right.
And uh,
this,

751
00:45:39.621 --> 00:45:44.621
this new guy got on sports radio out here in Los Angeles and you know,

752
00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.810
he does what most people do when they have nothing to say,
which is they,

753
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:55.270
they just start,
they just go over the top arrogant,

754
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:58.720
you know what I mean?
Like he was talking about how he wanted to get some,

755
00:45:58.721 --> 00:46:02.620
some sort of sports culture personality on the show,

756
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.890
but he doubted he could get him as a guest because the guest hated him.

757
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.550
And he goes,
you know,
cause I disagreed with them on some,

758
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:13.120
he was talking to a coach and he was actually disagreeing with the,

759
00:46:13.121 --> 00:46:16.390
with the fucking coach.
He's disagreeing with the guy and he goes,

760
00:46:16.391 --> 00:46:18.130
you know what the problem is,
you know,
he goes like,

761
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.020
I'm just like such a good debater.

762
00:46:20.021 --> 00:46:23.200
I actually ended up like convincing myself of my own opinion.

763
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.250
You actually said that over the airwaves and I just sorta muttered to myself

764
00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:31.810
that the confidence of morons is staggering.

765
00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:37.390
You know what I mean?
Morons think they know everything.
That's,

766
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:42.310
that's what makes them fucking morons.
And like the emails,

767
00:46:42.311 --> 00:46:47.080
like get with people who don't question the shit.
Um,

768
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.410
which is,
I dunno,
like last week when I,

769
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:51.160
when I went off on my little fucking rant there,

770
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:55.870
just some of the fucking emails I get,
it's like people are sending me Shit.

771
00:46:55.871 --> 00:46:57.610
That kinda is backing up what I'm saying.

772
00:46:57.611 --> 00:47:00.970
And then telling me that it sounded like I have tin foil on my fucking head,

773
00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.360
which obviously I am out of my fucking mind on some level,

774
00:47:04.361 --> 00:47:08.470
but I'm not out of my mind when I don't trust corporations and I don't trust

775
00:47:08.471 --> 00:47:12.280
them when they say we're not gonna do anything with this information.

776
00:47:12.281 --> 00:47:15.730
The other day I was in cvs and I go to buy something and the lady asked me,

777
00:47:15.731 --> 00:47:20.650
did I have a safe card?
And I said,
no.
She said,
do you want one?
And I said,

778
00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:23.890
no.
And she goes,
well,
that's okay.
I'll just,

779
00:47:23.891 --> 00:47:27.970
and she swiped the fucking thing anyways.
And I was like,
lady,

780
00:47:27.971 --> 00:47:32.500
what did I just say to you now?
See if I use my credit card,
they'd have my name

781
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.600
and then to match up to that fucking number and what the hell I just bought and

782
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:42.070
just a little bit more information about me and my question to all you people

783
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:43.450
who have these,
this faith,

784
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:44.960
<v 6>okay</v>

785
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.710
<v 5>in these corporations,
why does that person do that?</v>

786
00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:53.920
Why are they so hell bent on trying to make that corporation less money in that

787
00:47:55.131 --> 00:47:58.400
moment?
They give me this card,

788
00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:03.080
you know like everybody has those cards so you're not saving any fucking money.

789
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:08.390
It's just,
it's a big fucking shell game to make it seem,
oh look,

790
00:48:08.391 --> 00:48:10.720
you saving money.
What they're really doing there,

791
00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:14.510
they look at this hand over here is you're giving them all your personal fucking

792
00:48:14.511 --> 00:48:19.511
information that they can then use to the very least sell to other corporations

793
00:48:20.961 --> 00:48:25.961
to increase junk mail and it also to a limit you're fucking level of privacy.

794
00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.050
The fact that they can put all that shit up in the Goddamn Internet.

795
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:34.610
People have been sending me these random websites where they have like your name

796
00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:39.560
and your address,
where you fucking live and all this type of shit.
It's like,

797
00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.720
how do you think that they get all that information?

798
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.020
Do you think there's somebody sitting there with the phone book and just typing

799
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:50.890
all of this shit in?
I don't know.
I'll fuck it up.

800
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:52.840
<v 6>Okay.</v>

801
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:57.370
<v 5>If someone was,
what's what kills me?
If some fucking random creepy guy,</v>

802
00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.270
you know you're standing there waiting for the subway,
came up to you,

803
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:06.860
asks you what's your name,
your phone number and your address was,

804
00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:10.800
would you give it to him?
No,

805
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.450
but for some reason you're inside of a fucking store and there's socks and

806
00:49:15.451 --> 00:49:19.470
sweaters and somebody has a name tag.
Now all of a sudden you,
you,

807
00:49:19.471 --> 00:49:23.910
you give them total fucking trust.
You're writing your mind.
So sir,

808
00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:28.930
don't cave in.
All right.
All you get,
you just,

809
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:33.340
just say,
that's unacceptable.
That's unacceptable.

810
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.410
I want to speak to the manager what they're doing.
It's not legal yet.

811
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:39.910
It's not legal yet,

812
00:49:39.911 --> 00:49:44.911
but I can guarantee you there's somebody lobbying for it that in Washington

813
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.740
there's some sort of fucking high powered lobbying group.

814
00:49:47.741 --> 00:49:51.160
I swear to God is probably lobbying that from here on out,

815
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.000
we need to have a law that if you're going to return a hat,

816
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.890
you have to give us your name,
your address,

817
00:49:56.891 --> 00:50:01.891
and your social security number just so there's not another nine 11 could guaran

818
00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:04.840
fucking tee it.
So yeah,
you don't have to.

819
00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:10.870
That's actually one of the highlights of my day.
What I do now is when they say,

820
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:13.660
do you have our little savings save card?
And I say,
no I don't.

821
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.730
Would you like one?
No,
I don't.
I then say,
and please don't swipe another one.

822
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:24.180
You know,
and then I try to pay with cash.
I love cash.

823
00:50:24.181 --> 00:50:25.830
Cash is fucking anonymous.

824
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:29.690
All you guys out there who was sitting there watching these commercials where

825
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:32.600
they make it look like credit cards is so fucking easy.

826
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.820
You're idiots if you have,

827
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.770
you're buying into exactly what they want you to buy into,

828
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:44.360
which is a cashless society so they can keep track of where you are at all

829
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:49.190
fucking times and every last fucking dime that you make so they can get their

830
00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:51.020
greedy little fucking hands on it.

831
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:56.030
You're out of your mind and you're giving up an unbelievable amount of fucking

832
00:50:56.031 --> 00:51:00.680
privacy by creating a paper trail.
Everywhere you go,

833
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.660
everywhere you go,
what you're doing,
where you're at,
you know,

834
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.040
and the Sea of morons who we're going to sit there and go,
whoa,

835
00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.210
VA doing anything wrong.

836
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.360
<v 7>I mean,
I guess maybe,
maybe I'm a paranoid psycho.</v>

837
00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:19.790
You look at all these fucking idiots who do reality TV's and it,

838
00:51:19.791 --> 00:51:23.380
and they elect cameras come into their house and they don't seem to care about

839
00:51:23.381 --> 00:51:27.700
it.
Maybe,
uh,
maybe the average jackass doesn't give a shit.
But sir,

840
00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:29.260
for the love of God,

841
00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:31.893
<v 5>you know,</v>

842
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:34.760
<v 7>in the end he says,
I'm not crying conspiracy.</v>

843
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:39.530
It's very plain to see what they're doing.
It's not malicious or evil.
Yes it is.

844
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:42.950
It is malicious and it is evil and it is a conspiracy.

845
00:51:42.951 --> 00:51:46.190
They're conspiring to get everybody's information,

846
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.110
find out what they buy,

847
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.710
and they're lying to you saying that they're not going to share the information.

848
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:56.600
It's everything that you're saying.
It's not.
It is.
All right.
And that's it.

849
00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:58.790
That's two weeks in a row.
I'm on the soapbox.
See people,

850
00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:01.130
don't you like it better when I talk about sports?

851
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:06.890
<v 0>Ooh,</v>

852
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:24.383
<v 4>right.</v>

853
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.980
<v 7>Hyssop hyssop conspiracy theory for you.
Somebody said bill that they uh,</v>

854
00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:58.390
he wrote,
they are watching and um,

855
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:02.030
I got trashed for talking about conspiracy theory.

856
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:06.590
I've been trashed for talking about those automated checkout lines in the

857
00:53:06.591 --> 00:53:11.240
grocery store and saying that I'm paranoid and I'm afraid of technology and all

858
00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:15.260
this technology's just going to help my life and make my life more easier.

859
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.770
And why don't you trust these big fucking corporations?

860
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:22.420
Basically it's the shift that people will get from me.
So I have to get trashed.

861
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.980
Ralph,
you know,
talking shit about all these quirks.

862
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.420
<v 5>Actually</v>

863
00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.310
<v 7>having the audacity to think that bankers,</v>

864
00:53:28.311 --> 00:53:33.311
we're all trying to team up and have one World Bank had help to become the loan

865
00:53:33.591 --> 00:53:38.180
sharks for not have not only individual but actual countries.

866
00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.393
Okay.

867
00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:45.160
Which is something that I was thinking about when I was at the Rose Bowl stone

868
00:53:45.161 --> 00:53:49.120
sober and I was sitting there on the golf course and I was looking at these

869
00:53:49.121 --> 00:53:54.121
houses up on up on the ridge of this hill that actually looked down on,

870
00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.920
on the Roosevelt,
the granddaddy of them.

871
00:53:56.921 --> 00:53:59.320
All these people have a house that looks down on it.

872
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:03.610
And I was actually envisioning that those were all bankers up there.

873
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:09.390
And while the game was going on in 104,000 people or 96,000 we ever showed up

874
00:54:09.911 --> 00:54:12.040
for that game,
was sitting there going fucking crazy.

875
00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.660
One of those pieces of Shit bankers up there could put his hand on his son's

876
00:54:16.661 --> 00:54:20.800
shoulder and be like,
see all those people down there,
they owe all of us money.

877
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.280
They all owe me money,
son.

878
00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:28.640
I'm getting a piece of all of their fucking paychecks and they don't even know

879
00:54:28.641 --> 00:54:33.430
it.
They don't even know that their daddy is looking down on him right now.

880
00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:35.590
Now had it been drinking,

881
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:41.940
that thought would have probably caused me to,
uh,
you know,

882
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.240
entertain the thought of climbing up that hill and throwing a rock through one

883
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:45.721
of the windows,

884
00:54:45.721 --> 00:54:48.210
which of course I wouldn't have done because even my drunkest I am,

885
00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:52.860
I am aware that I don't want to go to jail and get raped.
And secondly,
I really,

886
00:54:52.861 --> 00:54:54.480
I'm not going to go all the way up.
That fucking helps.

887
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:58.280
What I've done is I probably would have yelled at that kid with the light purple

888
00:54:58.281 --> 00:55:02.480
slacks.
I would've commented really loud about that dude's fucking,
uh,

889
00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.720
Eczema flaking off into the back of his goddamn sweatshirt.

890
00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.340
Um,
so anyways,
this guy sends me this email and he says,

891
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:14.870
build the vase in this blog.
When I say they are watching our big business,

892
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.800
not the Illuminati,
but they are just as evil as any bank or secret society.

893
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.280
They don't even need your signature.
Listen to this shit.

894
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:27.380
They don't even need your signature for these information gathering trader where

895
00:55:27.381 --> 00:55:32.300
programs to monitor everything from where the device is to what your heart rate

896
00:55:32.301 --> 00:55:36.020
is.
What is trade where?
That's the question I had.

897
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.341
Um,

898
00:55:37.341 --> 00:55:42.341
you digital camera may embed metadata into photographs with cameras,

899
00:55:42.801 --> 00:55:45.380
serial number or your location.

900
00:55:45.381 --> 00:55:49.220
Your printer may be incorporating a secret code on every page at prince,

901
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:53.600
which could be used to identify the printer and potentially the person who used

902
00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:57.740
it.
Now,
now the fucking morons,
the sheep out there and be like,
yeah,

903
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:02.450
that's in case she threatened the president did just doing it for the good of

904
00:56:02.451 --> 00:56:07.040
all people.
Um,
if apple puts a particularly creepy patent,

905
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:12.000
I guess Apple's applying for this as a recently applied for the use,
um,

906
00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:12.830
for,
um,

907
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:17.390
you can look forward to a day when your iPhone may record your voice.

908
00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:21.320
Take a picture of your location,
record your heartbeat,

909
00:56:21.321 --> 00:56:24.120
and send that information back to the mothership.

910
00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:25.440
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

911
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:29.380
<v 7>this is Trey to wear devices that act behind your back and portray,</v>

912
00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.050
portray your privacy.
Now,
this is what the moron sheep are going to be to say,

913
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.093
well,
if

914
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.420
<v 5>do nothing row,
which the prowl.</v>

915
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:40.340
<v 6>Okay,</v>

916
00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.060
<v 5>that's,
that's the philosophy.</v>

917
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:45.210
That was the philosophy behind why they can record your phone calls.
Now,

918
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.800
if you ain't doing nothing,
we're tasting,

919
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:51.930
come out frogs gay doing nothing wrong.

920
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:58.280
Do you realize how fucking dumb that mindset is?

921
00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:04.510
So basically as long as you do what the people in power tell you what to do,

922
00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.500
you won't have a problem.

923
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:10.250
Do you understand how dangerous that is?

924
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.950
Do you want to stay and how fucking stupid it is to have that level of faith in

925
00:57:16.951 --> 00:57:19.920
the people who rule you?
You know what I mean?

926
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:22.443
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

927
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.110
<v 5>Hey,
you haven't noticed</v>

928
00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.450
<v 7>how much power can fuck somebody over.</v>

929
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.230
Like for some reason we always seem to focus on when celebrities get famous and

930
00:57:31.231 --> 00:57:34.560
then they wig out and start becoming these fucking mini tyrants.

931
00:57:34.561 --> 00:57:39.561
For some reason people don't feel they just have like this because they waved

932
00:57:39.601 --> 00:57:43.800
the flag and they and they play those songs that make you choked up that they

933
00:57:43.801 --> 00:57:47.040
never feel like that they'll have any sort of ulterior motive.
For this.

934
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.390
This is the type

935
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:53.990
<v 5>of technology that allows a small group of people to take over the world.</v>

936
00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:01.680
<v 7>Something that's socio paths have been trying to do since the beginning of time,</v>

937
00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.760
and they were never able to do it because at some point your army would be

938
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:07.690
stretched too thin.

939
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:09.040
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

940
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.873
<v 7>All right.</v>

941
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:10.780
<v 6>Okay.</v>

942
00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.570
<v 7>Germans,
the fucking Roman empire,
all that shit.
At some point,</v>

943
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:17.230
the fucking Japanese,
all of them,
everybody who's ever tried to fucking do it,

944
00:58:17.231 --> 00:58:21.700
at some point it gets stretched too thin.
So America,

945
00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:22.534
what we've done

946
00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:25.960
<v 5>is we then,
we,
we've,
we've done the,</v>

947
00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:30.460
we're putting this base here to protect you thing,
that brilliant thing.

948
00:58:30.461 --> 00:58:34.990
That's how we got our world empire.
So we just have a base.

949
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.260
Then also we have these insane weapons where we can nuke everybody.

950
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:40.810
So we were able to kind of do it that way.
But the problem is,

951
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.960
is when you really get into sociopathic thought,

952
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.860
and just like those people who are so into power that it makes it dick hard is

953
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:54.700
they want to know.
They want to be able to see everybody,

954
00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:59.530
know what they're thinking and know what they're doing at all times because not

955
00:58:59.531 --> 00:59:00.340
only they psychos,

956
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:04.150
but with that level of power becomes this unbelievable level of paranoia.

957
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:07.930
Like those people with those houses sitting on the ridge looking down into the

958
00:59:07.931 --> 00:59:11.490
rose bowl,
there's a fear.
Like we sit there looking up at it,
go look at,

959
00:59:11.491 --> 00:59:12.520
they got the fucking world.

960
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:17.620
There was a fear of when you attain that level of wealth,
of losing all of it,

961
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.640
and you've,
you begin on this,

962
00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:25.960
this quest to quiet your mind,
you want,

963
00:59:25.961 --> 00:59:30.961
you want to get a level of wealth and controlling your life that you are

964
00:59:31.991 --> 00:59:36.991
guaranteed that it will never go away in your lifetime or your kids' lifetime or

965
00:59:37.571 --> 00:59:38.440
your kids' kids.

966
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:42.970
So basically everybody that you know and love will be okay and you will be okay.

967
00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.400
You get into that psychotic fucking mindset and uh,

968
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.450
<v 7>you give those kinds of people this level of fucking technology and you're going</v>

969
00:59:52.451 --> 00:59:56.520
to have a problem.
I think that's unbelievable.
But that this shit is,

970
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.270
so they have this,
this website here,
uh,

971
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.960
the eff electronic frontier foundation that is trying to fight.

972
01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:04.720
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

973
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.680
<v 7>These things being put into,
into the,
the tech,
you know,
the cameras,</v>

974
01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.330
the cell phones and all that shit.

975
01:00:10.331 --> 01:00:13.330
Like the fact that there's a tracking device in your cell phone.

976
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.640
Like how come we didn't get to vote on that?

977
01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.140
How come we don't get to vote on that type of stuff?

978
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:22.950
I don't want people knowing where the fuck I am at all.
God Damn Times.
Okay.

979
01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.990
And I don't need you to show me,
Oh,

980
01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.620
we caught this fucking child molester with that.
So because of that,

981
01:00:28.621 --> 01:00:32.700
now everybody has to be like,
give me a fucking break.
They always have like,

982
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:34.670
you know that there's,
you know,

983
01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.830
a handful of good examples for that level of fucking control.

984
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:42.750
And then there's a zillion bad ones.
So I am 100% against the shit.

985
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.320
And,
um,
there's always been evil people in the fucking world.

986
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.700
There's always going to be evil fucking people in the world.
And when you get,

987
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:56.180
when you have this kind of technology that you're going to,
you're going to stop.

988
01:00:56.181 --> 01:01:00.860
They're going to stop small evil,
like individual,
you know,

989
01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.070
a fucking a serial rapist,
which you definitely want to stop.
All right?

990
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:12.790
But the price we're going to pay is you're going to allow a Stalin or a Hitler

991
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.820
Pol Pot,
whoever the fuck you want it,

992
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.760
you're going to la with that level of technology up to someone like that could

993
01:01:19.761 --> 01:01:24.390
get in power and,
and run the fucking world.
So,
you know,

994
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:25.623
I dunno

995
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:30.260
<v 5>totally 100% believe that you could roll all your fucking eyes all you want.
I,</v>

996
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.000
I honestly believe that.

997
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.170
And I also believe that the reason why there's so many of us right now and that

998
01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:38.930
the people at the top are not fucking concerned about it

999
01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.500
is because we're all expendable.
And when the waters rise up,

1000
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:46.420
the temperatures goes up and everything,

1001
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:48.190
they're not going to be the ones who are drowning.

1002
01:01:48.191 --> 01:01:51.820
You can guarantee that the user in our taxpayer money to build some sort of

1003
01:01:51.821 --> 01:01:54.280
something to make sure that they're okay.

1004
01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.730
And I think that their bailout plan because they know they can't stop people

1005
01:01:57.731 --> 01:01:58.361
from fucking,

1006
01:01:58.361 --> 01:02:03.361
because it feels too God damn good and Dixon pussies are readily available to

1007
01:02:03.551 --> 01:02:05.890
anyone.
It's like air,
you know?

1008
01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:07.460
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1009
01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:11.360
<v 5>So I think what they're going to gradually do is phase us out with robots and</v>

1010
01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:15.110
automated shit,
which is why I refuse to use it now.

1011
01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:16.910
How fucking crazy do I sound right now?

1012
01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.030
Has there been anything funny in the last fucking

1013
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:21.770
<v 7>five?
This is shit that I truly believe.</v>

1014
01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1015
01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:26.110
<v 7>You know corporations own like the DNA of a grizzly bear.</v>

1016
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:29.900
That's why they don't give a fuck that they're cutting down its habitat.

1017
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.890
They're like,
I will fucking grow another one in a petri dish.

1018
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.420
We're trying to take over everything and then wipe out.

1019
01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.830
I think they're going to try to wipe out the poor and the middle class keep a

1020
01:02:42.831 --> 01:02:46.010
couple of us,
like a small handful of us.
You know,

1021
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.150
the way that pandas are only in like a zoos at this point or some shit.

1022
01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.760
I don't know what made it pick the wrong fucking animal,
but that,
that that's,

1023
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:56.300
that's the direction I think it's going.
All right.
This your first crazy rant,

1024
01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:01.690
<v 4>which was based mainly at gut feelings and a couple of emails,
but,
um,</v>

1025
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:02.743
I truly believe that.

1026
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:19.193
Wow.

1027
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:06.350
John,

1028
01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:10.950
do you get a bad beat U of o.
