<v 1>That's how it goes.
It's just fucking,
it's unbelievable.
It's just fucking,</v>

37
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.470
I told you guys,
I saw this guy,

38
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.320
I've number of times I've just seen homeless people just,

39
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:46.180
I saw this guy just sitting in the sun,
right?
Burning up.

40
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.840
Even that,
he was just sitting there some middle of the afternoon,

41
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.950
just one of these restaurants that has tables out on the sidewalk and shit and

42
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:56.140
they didn't really know that.
Not policing them.
There's nobody there.

43
00:02:56.141 --> 00:03:01.141
So he's just sitting there sleeping sun on his face and he's got a fucking Colt

44
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:05.620
45 empty quarter left.
I Dunno what,

45
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.450
and I'm walking down the street fucking sitting there thinking about all this

46
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.860
shit I got to handle.
It's what I made in Atlanta and I just looked at that guy.

47
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.390
No,
it's was just like,
you know what?

48
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.080
That doesn't look that bad.

49
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.640
<v 2>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.890
<v 1>Obviously,
you know,
day in and day out it sucks,</v>

51
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.020
but you know how they have like Earth Day they on it just have like,

52
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.370
just like a homeless day.

53
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:31.720
It was just something where it's just okay to be in public,

54
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.540
taken a nap,
shit faced in the middle of the day.

55
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:36.670
Why everybody else goes to like you.
You get it.

56
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.590
It's like getting called for jury duty,
except it's fun.
Hey boss,

57
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:46.390
I'm not going to be in a work on Tuesday off I,
I,
I got a homeless day.

58
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.260
I ain't fair enough.
Fair enough.
And then you just go out,

59
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:52.330
you grab your fucking drink at choice,

60
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.380
you'll find a bench and he just get fucking hammered.

61
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.590
You just buy one in the afternoon,
you're asleep.

62
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.360
I Dunno.

63
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.680
Maybe this is because I've been on the wagon here for fucking nine weeks then

64
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:08.820
I'm looking at stuff like that.
But um,

65
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.460
<v 2>okay.</v>

66
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.950
<v 1>I Dunno.
I have no idea.
So I flew back,</v>

67
00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:15.740
took the first flight back.

68
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.590
I can't wait to tell you guys about this fucking movie.
Uh,

69
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:22.010
I got to do a scene with one of my favorite actors of all freaking time and one

70
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:25.280
of my favorite people and I was having such a good time.

71
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:28.520
I didn't even get a goddamn picture with them.
Um,

72
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.090
<v 2>okay.</v>

73
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.100
<v 1>Which is always fucking,
he can't,
he can't really do that.</v>

74
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:35.530
But I know that I already knew this guy before,
uh,
before I did it.
Um,

75
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.130
but we should've,
we should've got a fucking picture.
But anyways,
um,

76
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.520
so on the flight back,
I watched a cool hand,
Luke,

77
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.480
one of my favorite movies of all time and fast times at Ridgemont high.
Uh,

78
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.450
it was just both movies totally held up.
And,
uh,

79
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.230
one of the greatest fucking lines that has never quoted in fast times at

80
00:05:00.231 --> 00:05:04.310
Ridgemont high,
his demoed when he knocks up Jennifer,

81
00:05:04.311 --> 00:05:08.900
Jason Leigh and on,
he goes,
you know,

82
00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:12.500
is it mine?
He goes,
get shores.
He goes,

83
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.310
you know,
I suppose you want me to pay for it?

84
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.310
Oh my God,
what a fucking line.
I suppose you want me to pay for it?

85
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.790
It's like,
buddy,
she's fucking given you a do over.

86
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.610
You just fucked your whole life up.
You fucked her life up.

87
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:38.870
She's given you a fucking do over.
If he can live with it,

88
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.480
if you could fucking live with it.
You know what I mean?
I,
you know,

89
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:44.900
it's something I can't even talk about that talk cause I don't even know where

90
00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:49.130
the hell I stand on that thing.
Um,
I don't even know where it stands,

91
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.150
but like when people say it's a taking of a life,
I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
it is.

92
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.960
It is in my argument is,
is if you didn't have that procedure,

93
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.310
there would be a person

94
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.980
somewhere along the line somebody got whacked because there's one less person.

95
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.510
Yeah.
That's all I'm saying.
I don't know who the Hitman is.
You know,

96
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:11.120
you're sort of the Dodd,
you know,
if you have the procedure done,

97
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.000
you say gotta you gotta fucking take this guy out.
And then some of them,

98
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:15.800
the doctor goes in,
he's like the fucking,

99
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.770
he's that dude in the white suit in the untouchables.
Really.
Bill,

100
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.400
you're going to fucking joke about abortion.
I don't know.

101
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.540
I don't plan these things.
I just start talking.
You know what?

102
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:31.520
I got some fucking twatty Mick fucking cunt face giving me shit that I got too

103
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:34.850
much sports.
Dribble on it,
dribble on this stag.

104
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.970
Rarely dribbled like the fucking shit coming out of this side of your mouth.

105
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.970
When you sit there watching the God damn Kardashians.

106
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.340
Is that what you want me to talk about?
Oh,

107
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:46.970
did you see what Miss New York said to flavor flavor?
I don't give a fuck,

108
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.180
but you know,
if you're into it,
that's,
you know,
that's your thing.
Do your thing.

109
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.130
It's your faith.
What?
She went on a barge.

110
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.590
I can't tell you.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

111
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.370
so I watched cool hand Luke and uh,
I am seeing that in a minute.

112
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.930
I forgot how creepy.
Uh,
what's his face?
Oh my God.

113
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:15.110
He just fucking flaked on his name.
Kennedy.
George Kennedy.

114
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.740
Is that his fucking name?
Well,

but I gotta look it up now.
George Kennedy,

115
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.130

116
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.690
and he's a big mother fucker and he had a pot belly and he lived to be like 91

117
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:27.050
years old.
That doesn't happen.
Those big guys,
you know,

118
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:30.440
they slap people around for six decades and then all of a sudden they just face

119
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:34.980
down in a newspaper.
Mike,
Mike,
are you okay?
Um,

120
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.020
hang on a second.
Uh,
is it George Kennedy?
Yeah,
that's it.

121
00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:42.450
George Kennedy,
when he's,
when he,

122
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.580
when need all the girl who washes the fucking car,

123
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.240
he keeps calling out a little shaky or name Scott up.
Lou.
She,
I,

124
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.690
I gotta watch it again to try to get his accent down.

125
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.970
She was over there often that call only a pin.

126
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.090
Hold it,
hold it together.
I didn't understand like they,

127
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:07.700
they couldn't like do like back then they couldn't talk about like prison rape

128
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:08.534
and shit.

129
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.500
So they just had these guys sitting in there like reading like dirty fucking

130
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.080
stories about like red shoe diaries,

131
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:19.040
shit to each other and then what they get all fucking frustrated.

132
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.760
I mean at that point somebody is going to fuck something or beat the shit out of

133
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:26.150
somebody,
but it never does.
Um,
but anyways,

134
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.030
what a fucking great,
what a God damn.
Great movie.

137
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.830
basically says,

138
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.670
Cackling and fucking hacking up a lung.

141
00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:58.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

142
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.430
<v 1>Fucking hates authority.
You tell them to go left,</v>

143
00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:03.380
he's going to go fucking right eat.
Did you know,

144
00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:06.440
obviously he's doing this at a prison level?
I don't,
I don't recommend that,

145
00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:07.550
but there's a will.
There's a fruit.

146
00:09:07.551 --> 00:09:11.540
Like when I watched that guy like this fucking does it like to kind of guy in

147
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:12.890
high school that you'd hang out with?

148
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.080
Like people there's been a problem with,
with people driving their cars,

149
00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:23.390
students driving their cars too fast.
I don't know who's driving on the property.

150
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.630
And then the second you fucking say that,
that's it.

151
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:29.270
He's gonna take his car that weekend.
He's going to do fucking donuts.

152
00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:30.470
Laughing his balls off.

153
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

154
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.730
<v 1>Just knowing that it's going to irritate somebody.
I Dunno.</v>

155
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760
Maybe I'm missing the point of the movie,
but,
um,

156
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.030
<v 0>okay.</v>

157
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.090
<v 1>Just a fucking great movie.
Do you know?
Uh,
actually one of the,
uh,</v>

158
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.920
when they go to pave the road,

159
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:46.560
they're throwing the sand on top of whatever the fuck they're spraying on the

160
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:48.540
road.
Um,

161
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:51.990
that music was composed for that scene and then somebody connected with the

162
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.250
movie,
sold it to the nightly news and that became the nightly news song.

163
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.380
And uh,
some of the actors were upset because they felt it ruined that scene.
Uh,

164
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.470
you don't hear it now,
but that was the song that they played for like decades.

165
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.450
Uh,
whatever the fuck that was.

166
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:11.340
I think I've actually already talked about this on the podcast.
Um,
anyways,

167
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.430
what do you want from me?
All right.
Onto my sports drivel.
Alright.

168
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.590
Um,

169
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.240
what enough fuck is going on with these fucking New York Yankees.

170
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:23.150
They are God damn buzzsaw.

171
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.730
This is the second series in a row where they play rope a dope.

172
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.210
They lean on the ropes,
they let you win game one.
Oh good.
We won game one.

173
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.630
Who fucking hold in home court here,
holding home serve whatever they say.

174
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.240
And then they win game two.
And then you think you got them.

175
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

176
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.870
<v 1>You thinking yourself these fucking morons.</v>

177
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.280
Now they got to win four out of five or they got to win the next three in a row.

178
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.820
What do they do?
The Yankees right now are giving the epitome.

179
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.690
If you look up right there,
Fred in the fucking dictionary,

180
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.900
that's what they're doing.
That's what they're doing.

181
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.680
And what the fucking Indians and Astros are doing is a classic example,

182
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.790
a cold lotion.
What they're doing to their fence or what the Indians did,

183
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.550
they won the first two.
They got him all fucking excited.

184
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.780
Whether you went 22 fucking games in a row and then you lose three in a row

185
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.560
after being up to two to zip in a five game series.

186
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.920
<v 0>Um,
anyways,</v>

187
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.800
<v 1>the fucking Dodgers are up three games to none out here.
He had never know.</v>

188
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.540
You'd never know.

189
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.080
You know what I realized with the Dodgers being up three games to none,

190
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.910
one game away from the world series and I don't,

191
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.090
I didn't even fucking know about it.
You know what it is.

192
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:38.091
I don't have enough Mexican friends out here because those people,

193
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:42.330
God bless them,
are single handedly keeping that franchise here in La.

194
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.040
I swear to God,
if they weren't going to the games,

195
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:50.970
that fucking team would have left somewhere.
I Dunno.
In the 80s

196
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.050
I don't know what it is.
I know this.
I don't,

197
00:11:56.051 --> 00:12:01.051
I don't want to know where the white guy fucking grew up here in l a baseball

198
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:06.550
fan lives.
I just don't know where the fuck they are.

199
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:08.920
I haven't said they were up three games to none.
I didn't see,

200
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.760
I drove from lax all the way to my house.
I didn't see one banner.

201
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.060
I didn't fucking feel any buzz.
Nobody with the hat.

202
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:18.960
Nobody with a Jersey Zip,

203
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.723
<v 4>nothing.</v>

204
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.080
<v 1>I was stunned when,
I mean,
I've been working so I wasn't paying attention.</v>

205
00:12:26.081 --> 00:12:26.380
I thought,

206
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.550
I thought it was like two one somebody I didn't know it was three games to none.

207
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.250
I didn't know they,
they'll write on the bucket break.

208
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.413
<v 4>MMM.</v>

209
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.550
<v 1>Do you realize,
okay,</v>

210
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.580
if the fucking Yankees win and the Dodgers win and we have a Yankees dodger

211
00:12:44.611 --> 00:12:46.650
fucking series,
okay.

212
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.440
They're going to do the whole legal Brooklyn drag is,
I got the name Dad,

213
00:12:52.441 --> 00:12:54.710
here's they were the trolley Dodgers and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

214
00:12:54.711 --> 00:12:57.150
Blah and abbots field,
and somehow somewhere,

215
00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:00.660
some fucking old bastards going to come out of the woodwork and start talking

216
00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:01.494
about it,
right?

217
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.693
<v 4>You know,</v>

218
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.470
<v 1>fuck all of that.
All right,
not fuck all of that.
Baseball is,
is,
is,
is a,</v>

219
00:13:09.471 --> 00:13:13.550
is as sport steeped in history.
As long as they bring up Vince Scully,

220
00:13:13.551 --> 00:13:14.540
it's going to be fucking great.

221
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:18.260
But all I'm saying is that takes me back to when I first started watching

222
00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:19.094
baseball,

223
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:24.130
1977 1978 back to back fucking years.

224
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.890
I rooted for the Dodgers because the red sox could not beat the fucking Yankees

225
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.773
and then we,
you know,

226
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.290
that was the Bucky Dent Year was 78 and I would root for them

227
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.880
and they lost 77 the Dodgers and I rooted for him again and they lost again.

228
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.130
Then the next year was pirates first,

229
00:13:46.131 --> 00:13:50.870
the orals orals up three games to one gave the fans the old cold lotion.

230
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.410
Pirates came back with the right day of Fred,
one at seven,

231
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.360
then you had 1980 was a Pete rose.
Ah,

232
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.830
let me get 50 on your fucking page.
Boy Haircut.
He gave Gig,

233
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:07.820
goes over to the Phillies.
Right.
I quit the fuck.

234
00:14:07.821 --> 00:14:10.280
Did they play in the world series?
I think it was Kansas City.

235
00:14:10.281 --> 00:14:14.900
They finally got past the Yankees.
That's what it was.
Um,
yeah.

236
00:14:14.901 --> 00:14:16.220
Every year I root for Kansas City,

237
00:14:16.221 --> 00:14:17.990
then they'd lose and then I root for the Dodgers.

238
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.210
But Kansas City got passed and then Pete Rose fucking led the Phillies to their

239
00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:26.360
first world series victory in a hundred fucking years.

240
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.150
They won one in like 1881 or some shit.

241
00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:33.770
And then 1980 they were actually the cubs before the fucking cubs.

242
00:14:33.771 --> 00:14:36.530
Just everybody forgets.
Um,

243
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.140
then 1981,
the Dodgers play the Yankees again and I'm like,

244
00:14:42.141 --> 00:14:43.310
what the fuck?

245
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.933
<v 4>You know,</v>

246
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.680
<v 1>third time's got to be a chairman.
They finally fucking one.</v>

247
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.800
I believe that was with Fernando Valanzuela,
wasn't it?

248
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.260
Dave winfield and Port Tommy.

249
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:58.550
John played for the Dodgers and 77 loss to the Yankees played for the Dodgers.

250
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.440
And 78 lost to the Yankees and in 81,
hey,

251
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:08.441
switch tapes and he plays for the New York Yankees and he loses to the fucking

252
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:13.460
Dodgers.
Oh,
Jesus.

253
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:17.720
Can you imagine how quiet that fucking ride was home with his,
with his wife?

254
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:20.780
My goodness,
Tommy.

255
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:23.030
At least they named a surgery after you.

256
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.603
<v 4>MMM.</v>

257
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.090
<v 1>Anyways,
by the way,
I know there's everybody's fucking,</v>

258
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.510
I don't know,
talking about this horrific injury.

259
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.883
<v 4>MMM.</v>

260
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.710
<v 1>I gotta make sure I get his name right and he's brand new.
He said,
Hayward,</v>

261
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.620
that poor fucking guy

262
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.450
a I want to write Haywood is that guy on the white shadow?

263
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.840
Hayward Gordon Hayward.

264
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:53.140
<v 4>Okay.</v>

265
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.200
<v 1>You know,
here's the thing.
Everybody's freaking out about it.
Like,
oh my God.</v>

266
00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:59.830
It was like,
yeah,
it was fucking grotesque.
But,
uh,

267
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.651
if I was him,

268
00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:06.651
I would be psyched that it was a bone and not blowing out your Achilles or your

269
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.700
fucking ACL because according to this guy I talked to in a bar one time,

270
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.990
who is not a physician on any fucking level,
he,
uh,
I don't know.

271
00:16:15.991 --> 00:16:18.180
Maybe we'll all these sports center things.
I don't know what it is.

272
00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:22.590
I overheard at some point that when you break a bone,
if it's set right,

273
00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:24.300
when it grows back,
it's actually stronger.

274
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.860
So he's going to come back with a bionic ankle and tendons.
Fine.

275
00:16:28.861 --> 00:16:30.630
I think it'll be backed by a,

276
00:16:30.631 --> 00:16:34.350
I'm going to say it's a non doctor and not looking at the x rays that I don't

277
00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:38.820
know not to read.
I'm going to say in February,
I say comes back in February.

278
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.623
<v 4>MMM.</v>

279
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.640
<v 1>It'll be fine.
It's just,
it's just that is fucking,</v>

280
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.380
yeah,
the angle that his foot was that uh,
yeah,
that was brutal.
But I'll tell you,

281
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:54.530
it's still not as bad as your thighs,
but it's not as bad as Joe Theismann.

282
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:56.810
It's not as bad as far as grotesque.

283
00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.430
That fucking kid was at Louisville a few years ago with the kids just ran away

284
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.990
when that happened.
Um,
I still haven't looked at that one.

285
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:08.240
And then there was a time I saw in the UFC,

286
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.660
this guy fucking kicked somebody compound fracture and he brought his leg back

287
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:18.170
to put weight on it and he didn't realize he had broken both bones down there.

288
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:19.460
What's,
what's,
what's below your knee,

289
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:22.610
what does that tether the radius and the Ulna and it's your fucking arm.

290
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:26.570
Then you get the humerus and then you get your femur and you get your Patella.

291
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.280
You get your tarsals,

292
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:31.430
your metal tarsals and your flange is what the fuck is down there?

293
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.510
Your Fibula and your tibular.
Oh,
frick and frack and a leg.
They're right.

294
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.070
The twins,
the twins fucking hanging around like the little fish in the,

295
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:43.130
you're famous,
the whale there,
they're a little fishies underneath it.
Right?

296
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.090
He fucking broke both of those things and he goes to put all his weight on the

297
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:49.590
God damn leg and his fucking,

298
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.570
you ever see a little kid put on adults like rain boot on that goes up to their

299
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:59.420
knee and they and it just kind of fold.
That's what the fuck happened.
Ah,

300
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.800
yeah.
That was a gross.
Well,
let's talk about broken light.
Obviously,

301
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:06.750
Joe Theismann is sort of the,
uh,
one small step for man,

302
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.130
one giant leap for mankind.

303
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:13.131
That's like the fucking lunar landing of broken bones and sports.

304
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.580
That's,
that's sort of the original as far as I remember.

305
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.840
And then there was of course,
the,
uh,
the guy walked in,

306
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.450
I never know the fighters names to go fucking walked in.

307
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.430
He'd come walking in like a crab or a spider and he's fucking around that one

308
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.610
fight,
acting like he wasn't hurting.
And the guy fucking really knocked him out.

309
00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.650
Then he was like,
all right,
I'm coming back.

310
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:37.080
And he went to go kick him and he fucking broke both bones.

311
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.140
That was fucking brutal.
And I,
I left the room.
I was like,

312
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:42.360
I don't want to see that again.
And My,

313
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.300
my quaff rewound that like fucking,

314
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.680
I don't know how many times was fascinated by fascinate.

315
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.930
It's unbelievable.
I can't fart in bed,

316
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.570
but she can fucking sit there and look at that.
I mean,
I mean,

317
00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:57.580
women try to figure him out.
Um,

318
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.980
anyways,
whatever.
Was It 19 minutes in Jesus Christ?
Tell me what,

319
00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:06.060
fuck man,
I get it.
I don't have my advertising with me,

320
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:10.530
I'm just gonna have to plow through this.
Um,
oh man,

321
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:14.300
I got to a nice political debate up here.
I'll tell you,
you know,

322
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.300
this is what you gotta do.
Yeah.

323
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.590
If you're in a red state right now or if you're in a blue state,

324
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.320
you're probably sick of people that agreeing with you.

325
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:26.340
So what you need to do is you need to go to another state and just wait til

326
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.700
politics comes up.
He just argued the other side.
You have a great fucking time.

327
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.700
You know,
like when I'm in a red state,

328
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.440
if I say anything about Trump or whatever,
like people,
the heads almost explode.

329
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.460
Like it's,
so you tend to be fucking Hillary with a fucking,
you know,

330
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.930
they do that and then out here and see exactly.
Dump.
Is it,
um,

331
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.580
this person I was arguing with today just kept grabbing their head

332
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.090
like they couldn't believe
they were talking about like,

333
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.590
that Hillary didn't win because she was a woman.
And I was just like,

334
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.160
I was basically saying that there was probably some sexism obviously.

335
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.740
Right.
But like,
it's just,
it's not just one fucking thing.

336
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.150
There's a whole bunch of things.

337
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.910
There's also the fact that people are sick of the Clintons and the sick of the

338
00:20:22.911 --> 00:20:26.330
bushes,
the bushes in the,
I want Jeb Bush came along.
It's like,

339
00:20:26.331 --> 00:20:31.331
how many times did he bang Barbara [inaudible] how many are there after a while?

340
00:20:32.211 --> 00:20:36.080
Like a political family just gets played out and you just don't want it.

341
00:20:36.081 --> 00:20:37.310
You just don't want to see him again.
You know,

342
00:20:37.311 --> 00:20:39.230
you want the bushes and the Clintons are right now.

343
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.640
Do you remember whether they would like in the 10th season of the office and

344
00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:45.710
even Steve Carell was like,
dude,
this is over.

345
00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:48.550
He liked fucking left and just can't make it more of them.

346
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.340
That's what the Clintons in fucking bushes are.
It's just,
it,
it's over.
It's over.

347
00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.030
Get your residuals and ride off into the sunset.

348
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.970
They just won't do it.
They keep coming back for another season.
Um,

349
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.370
yeah,
so it's unbelievable.

350
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.520
So if you bring up anything that Trump does to Trump people,

351
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.130
they lose their fucking minds.
If you bring up anything that like,

352
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.670
like all they see is what the other person fucking did.
It's unreal.

353
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.810
That would be like me as a sports fan,

354
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.850
not being able to see like how amazing it is,

355
00:21:26.011 --> 00:21:29.670
what the Yankees are doing right now.
I'm not saying like,
you know,

356
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.430
I can't say I'm rooting against them.

357
00:21:32.431 --> 00:21:36.900
I gotta be honest with you as a fucking red sox fan,
49 years old.

358
00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.940
The,
for me,
the movie was all for me that I just say,
I said that for real,

359
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.650
for real,
for real.
Z.
I just feel like for me,

360
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.160
2004,
that was it.

361
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.120
That was the end of the movie roll credits.
You know,
it's fucking over.

362
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:59.190
You can't chant 1918 Addison anymore.
No matter how much you say we choked,

363
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.500
we're never going to choke more than you guys did.

364
00:22:01.501 --> 00:22:04.530
That was a historical fucking choke.
No one's ever done that.

365
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:08.490
No one will ever do that again with a $200 million fucking team.

366
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.650
No one will ever be first again.
You know what I mean?
They'll be the Colby,

367
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.890
they won't be the Jordan of choking.
Um,

368
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.630
there'll be the second one doing what had already been done.
So let me,

369
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.650
that was the end roll credits.
It's over.
And then we want to more.

370
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.650
So who gives a shit?
What are,
we were going to catch the Yankees,

371
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.390
this 30 fucking teams now that you can't and all of those sports,
you can't,

372
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.720
you know,
unless she got two teams going at it,
like Celtics and Lakers.

373
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:41.860
Um,

374
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.860
although the Lakers caught up with the Celtics as even as all these,

375
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:50.770
uh,
teams increased.
So I fucking hate saying that as a Celtics fan,

376
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:52.390
but what they've done,
I feel is the most amazing.

377
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.890
They won the most championships in my fucking lifetime since 1968.

378
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:59.590
I fucking hate saying that,
but it's true.
These fucking bastards,

379
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.950
they could build a team and then when it went into the free agent thing,

380
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.470
they had all these fucking whores out here,

381
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.530
all these starlets for these fucking guys to bang.

382
00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:10.780
And they had the great weather and we just couldn't keep up with them.

383
00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.680
We couldn't keep up with them.
We had fucking winter,
you know,
we,
you know,

384
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:18.250
we had racist racism and shit.
They had racism out here til Jesus Christ.

385
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.280
You know,
it's the racisms fucking equal.
But you know,

386
00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:26.260
so then the tip and point becomes the weather in the Hollywood fucking is,

387
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.080
I mean right there,
it's over
Dover.
It's fucking over.

388
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.000
We'd get palm trees and Hollywood fucking who was all right.
What do we get?

389
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.890
What do we got?
We got the freedom trail and a Sam Adams beer.
I mean this,

390
00:23:40.891 --> 00:23:45.350
you know,
I mean,
come on,
you're just not going to some,

391
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.430
you might want to get one of those big goofy European guys to fall for that
shit,

392
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:57.350
but you're not going to get an American.
Um,
anyways,

393
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.550
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here.
Uh,
I will say that this is,

394
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:06.470
this is the fucking think Houston astro fence.
Uh,

395
00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:09.410
I'm apologizing now cause I loved your uniforms.

396
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.980
Reminds me of the fucking orange crushes back when they put the real fucking

397
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:17.870
sugar in them.
Uh,
uniforms with great Tate.

398
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.240
You had a rough three games.
Okay.
Um,

399
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.470
did you guys notice?
All right,

400
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.440
that was joking with this comic Yannis Pappas,
right?

401
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.760
I was joking with them how,
you know he's going,

402
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:35.210
Houston's a strong team at home.
And I was like,
all right,

403
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:39.950
but like the Yankees fan base,
like

404
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.150
the sound of the crowd is this.

405
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:49.490
They're used to winning and there's an expectation even though all that,

406
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.640
you know,
I mean the drought for them is they haven't won since 2009.

407
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:58.690
Okay.
There's an expectation and there's an,
um,
the,

408
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.650
they have a level that's unacceptable.
Okay.

409
00:25:01.651 --> 00:25:04.470
And there's very few crowds that you hear that in a Celtic crowd.

410
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.540
You hear that in a Yankee crowd.

411
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.180
I hate to say that she hid that with Montreal Canadian,

412
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:14.400
but they're hanging on by their fucking skin of their teeth cause it's been so

413
00:25:14.401 --> 00:25:18.210
fucking long that they at this point have two generations that have never seen a

414
00:25:18.211 --> 00:25:20.250
fucking Stanley Cup.

415
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.280
So what you need that continued fucking success to get that train fucking

416
00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:28.770
rolling.
All right.
Houston,
astro crowd.

417
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

418
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:30.830
<v 1>I mean,</v>

419
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.450
you guys sound like you guys are one of those towns where it's a playoff game

420
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:38.540
and it's in your big fucking deal is you're going to,

421
00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:42.410
everybody's going to show up and where the same colored free tee shirt,

422
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:48.620
you know what I mean?
Somebody's going to harm you.

423
00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.750
Right?
Doing that dumb shit.
Um,
I dunno.

424
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.840
I Dunno if you need to win a bunch of championships to get that fucking sound,

425
00:25:57.841 --> 00:26:01.950
but,
uh,
I don't know.
You don't hear it that often.

426
00:26:01.951 --> 00:26:06.700
And when I listened to the Yankees in October of the Celtics and fucking Megan

427
00:26:06.701 --> 00:26:11.520
and June,
uh,
the old forum had that sound.
I think,

428
00:26:11.521 --> 00:26:15.120
you know,
if you sit in the upper deck,
it staples center,

429
00:26:15.121 --> 00:26:16.380
I think you'd probably hear it,

430
00:26:16.381 --> 00:26:19.620
but like a staples centers I've said for a long time,

431
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:21.930
one of the most hostile fucking venues there is,

432
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.000
it's just if you've got money,
you're down below.
And if you don't,

433
00:26:27.001 --> 00:26:30.300
you're up top go fuck yourself.
And the moat in between.

434
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.830
It's just three stories of luxury boxes.

435
00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.110
I mean,

436
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.950
I dunno if you've ever gone to a third world country where there's like 10% of

437
00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:42.570
the people have,

438
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:47.630
have fucking all the money and then everybody else has a 10 fucking check the

439
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:51.960
staple center.
That's what,
that's the way it's set up.
Um,

440
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:58.080
anyways,
so who knows.
I'm going to watch that game six if I'm not working.

441
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:02.850
I don't know when the fuck it is.
I think Friday,
uh,
uh,
work in,

442
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:05.910
I'm in Austin.
Oh,
that's right.
I'm an Austin,
Texas.

443
00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:09.870
This weekend I got two shows Friday both sold out.
Thank you very much.

444
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.560
And then I got one on Saturday and I,
you know what I decided because my,

445
00:27:14.561 --> 00:27:19.080
my Madison Square garden recording,
it ain't happening.

446
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.160
I Dunno what to do with it.
It's a,
I fucked up.
I thought when I said,

447
00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:26.580
told him that I wanted to record that they understood that I was making an album

448
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.320
and they just took it right from the board.
So I sound all loud and happy.

449
00:27:31.321 --> 00:27:33.330
Like I'm killing it.
Madison Square Garden.

450
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.270
And then the crowd sounds like it's a coffee house.

451
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.430
So the recording sounds ridiculous.
Like,
why is this guy so excited?
You know,

452
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.950
he's not doing that well.
Um,

453
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:49.160
so I've decided when I go to the cool venues like this Austin city limits,

454
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:52.140
I'm just going to start recording my shit and I don't know what I'm going to do

455
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:56.100
with it.
I think I'm just going to randomly put out some vinyls,

456
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.000
like some finals,
uh,
albums and um,

457
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.480
whatever.
Just to fucking have them who knows something fucking dead and gone.

458
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.920
There'll be these different versions of my hour of bullshit that I was working

459
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:14.490
on.
Right.
That'd be interesting.
Maybe.
I Dunno.
I Dunno if that works with jokes.

460
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.300
Uh,
so when he was,
I'm going to be recording this weekend,
so,
uh,

461
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.710
I don't know if that's an added fucking little cheese.
It,

462
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:24.390
that'll get you to come down there.
I have no idea.

463
00:28:24.391 --> 00:28:27.510
I'm working with fucking Dean del Rey and then we're hanging around on fucking

464
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:31.440
Sunday and we're going to the formula one race,

465
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.970
maybe going to see Louis Hamilton wrap it up.
Um,

466
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.020
I've been so fucking busy.
I haven't been watching the moto GP.

467
00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:43.480
I did see that fucking highlight of a Mac.

468
00:28:43.481 --> 00:28:48.481
Mac has a pass and what the David [inaudible] one of the great fucking names of

469
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:53.910
all the time and I always screw it up in the rain.

470
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.190
Fucking passed them on one of the final turns.
It's just such a tremendous sport.

471
00:28:59.250 --> 00:28:59.970
And uh,

472
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.970
whoever the fuck it was in my podcast that suggested that I should watch it.

473
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:07.640
I want to thank,
I want to thank each you.
Um,
what am I up to here?

474
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.840
29 God damn minutes.
Um,
all right.

475
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.960
I had such a fun time arguing politics and in the end,
uh,
you know,
uh,

476
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.940
how the other person could come on.
All right,
we're all Americans here,
right?

477
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.100
Everybody relax.
Everybody relax.
Stop watching CNN 24 hours a day.
Oh,

478
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:30.630
watching Fox News 24 hours a day.
What you do is you watch him each 12 hours,

479
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.440
right?
And then you balance out your fucking propaganda.
You know what I mean?

480
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:38.340
Then you go to an NFL game,
you watch them sell your war.
You know,

481
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:43.060
it's sort of like a,
we'll a war rally before the game.

482
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.980
They do everything,
but actually as you to buy war bonds,
um,

483
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.740
I think that's the Pentagon,
making sure everybody stays on the same page.

484
00:29:55.741 --> 00:29:58.380
We don't end up with a Vietnam here.
They don't need a,

485
00:29:58.381 --> 00:30:01.710
we don't need a bunch of fucking hippies out there burning their fucking draft

486
00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:01.990
card.

487
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:06.990
You gave [inaudible] just get everybody out there to support the troops and uh,

488
00:30:07.621 --> 00:30:11.190
I don't know.
I'm a cynical motherfucker,
you know,

489
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:16.380
I feel like they using those kids,
I'm probably wrong.
I am a fucking idiot.
But,

490
00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:19.980
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno about that one.

491
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.460
At the very least,
at the end of all of it,

492
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.030
even if the Pentagon and everybody's heart is in the right place to fucking NFL

493
00:30:27.031 --> 00:30:31.500
is making money off of it and it's so fucking gross.
It's gross.

494
00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.530
Just stay in your own lane.
Okay.

495
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.220
You know,
hey,
you know what the,
you know,

496
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:41.700
the NFL has in common with our fucking military.

497
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.790
They don't take care of that veterans either.
Oh,

498
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.510
I'm not right.
I'm done.
I'm fucking around with you guys.

499
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:51.360
See if I can get a little bit of hate mail.
All right.

500
00:30:51.361 --> 00:30:55.980
You want to talk music for a second year?
I finally downloaded,
I downloaded,

501
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.160
uh,
uh,
I can never met.

502
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.320
Not a love supreme stank on yeah.
Stink on IA.

503
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.070
It was Andre 3000,
and then there was the other guy.

504
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.210
I just download it because I liked the fucking trumps.

505
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.093
<v 2>You know,</v>

506
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.620
<v 1>my brain doesn't work fast enough
for some of them.
To me,</v>

507
00:31:20.621 --> 00:31:24.760
this is modern music.
I'm so far behind.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's fucking ridiculous.

508
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.980
The hell did I,
uh,
right.
Download.
What does the name of Stanko not stink on you?

509
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.070
What the fuck is that?
That's,
that was called,
is it outcast?

510
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:39.270
This has to sound like your fucking parents,
you know,
I like,

511
00:31:39.271 --> 00:31:43.650
I liked that the outside his dad's outcast.
Um,
not even then,

512
00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:48.000
because this is like fucking 20 years old at this point.
2017 years.
Yeah.

513
00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.160
Stank on yet day ago.

514
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:52.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

515
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.651
<v 1>And I gotta be honest with you,</v>

516
00:31:53.651 --> 00:31:58.120
I downloaded this shit because I thought that this would be a good bass drum

517
00:31:58.121 --> 00:31:59.170
exercise right here.

518
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.333
<v 5>That's it.</v>

519
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:11.580
<v 1>Go,
go,
go decker,
uh,
dead.
APOPO boom,
boom,</v>

520
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.880
boom debt.
Just do that for fucking an hour then could I play good times,

521
00:32:15.881 --> 00:32:18.410
bad times?
I Dunno.
Bill,
would anybody give a shit?
Yeah.

522
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.340
All right.
I'm going to stop here.

523
00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:25.220
I'll probably get the advertising later on tonight and I'll fucking,

524
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.500
I'll go to read that.
Um,

525
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.960
does the Thursday afternoon podcasts just before Friday,
Thursday afternoon,

526
00:32:32.961 --> 00:32:35.450
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Just checking in on you,

527
00:32:35.451 --> 00:32:39.350
seeing how your week is going.
Enjoy the Thursday night football.

528
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.580
All right.
Support your candidate.
Support the troops.

529
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:47.690
Support the global warming Velcade sign with the Lakers.

530
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.700
Just do the whole fucking rap up here.

531
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.830
It's better to break an ankle then the blowout or Neek.

532
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.430
That's basically the physical,
uh,

533
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.300
burn the hands better than two in the bush.

534
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.600
Oh look who's here.

535
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:08.810
Look who's here with a shirt that says flawless.
You know what?

536
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:13.850
I agree.
Isn't that just,
you know what?
It's about what I just said.

537
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:16.940
They're near.
It was sweet,
but wasn't it just a little too sweet?

538
00:33:16.941 --> 00:33:21.941
Wasn't just a little too on the nose now and I don't think so now believed that.

539
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.060
What are you saying?
You weren't being genuine?

540
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:32.030
I am aware that there's people listening to this theory or phony.

541
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.510
Well,
there's going to be an element of phoniness
and you on a mile with Dayak.

542
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.340
I don't know what that means.
Sorry.

543
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.820
I thought he's dealt with that yet though.
He said,

544
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:52.800
was that Hendog he said that too.
Yeah,

545
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.130
but it says a one half mile with that yet.

546
00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.540
To me that's good weather and he's on the back of what a yak is literally on a

547
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:09.410
Yak Yak.
In my world,
in my white world,

548
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.440
a yak is either you puked from drinking or it's that farm animal I've never

549
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:19.070
seen.
Right.
No.
Actually we saw at that time when we went out to that,

550
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.960
that wine winery that also had the Zeus for tax purposes,

551
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:29.180
Malibu wine safari.
A lot of people don't know that.
If you actually,

552
00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:32.880
if you have a Giraffe,
quit,
skip,
sorry.

553
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.980
If you have a giraffe on your property and you actually lowers your taxes,

554
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.510
but you have to have a certain amount of kids coming by looking at it going,

555
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:46.340
oh wow,
that's great.
And then the government goes,
oh,
all right.
Oh,
all right.

556
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:49.970
And when that girl got bit by the,
by the camel,

557
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:55.850
what you don't remember when the girl got bit by the camel kind of,
Oh,

558
00:34:55.851 --> 00:35:00.260
that group of girls did see broads in front of us and the guy goes,
all right.

559
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.490
Uh,
if you go to feed the camels and you run out of food,

560
00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:08.360
make sure you're not basically within their,
their camel

561
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.890
was it and it was an alumna and isn't like a,

562
00:35:15.121 --> 00:35:18.050
a camel's,
a Lama would like osteoporosis,
isn't it?

563
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:25.810
It's got,
it's got lumps personally.

564
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:29.660
My favorite outkast album.
Why are you,
why are you looking at that?

565
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.350
Oh,
cause I downloaded it just cause I liked the bass drum.

566
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:37.830
This bass drum.
Yeah.

567
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.510
Just regular.

568
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:54.030
Um,
yeah.
Do you not remember that heat?
Whatever the fuck it was.

569
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:57.630
It was something,
yeah.
Not from this country,
right.

570
00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.750
Lamaze don't have their green card.
Do they?
It's Trump getting rid of them too.

571
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:05.940
I'm probably,
I stand with the llamas.
They're filthy.

572
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:06.803
They're rapists.

573
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:14.460
They're taking now the jobs.
They've eaten all the grass.
Right,
exactly.

574
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.950
Then all the cows are like,
oh,
fucking forum.
Um,
is that a fat joke?

575
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.680
I don't think it was anyway,
so he tells him whatever the fuck it was.

576
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:26.220
It was a lama.
If,
if I,
I got an a guest,
three animals.

577
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:30.870
It was either a camel,
I think it was a camel.
Okay.
Um,

578
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.840
so he,
in the beginning of a joke,
a camel,
a camel,

579
00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:38.841
and a Lama and a giraffe are all at a winery to the guy on the fucking,

580
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.280
the guy who was dressed like a,

581
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:44.760
the man with the yellow hat says to these deaths,

582
00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.650
tends to everybody in the fucking truck.

583
00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.680
He was dressed the way they always dressed with those safari close and then not

584
00:36:52.681 --> 00:36:55.440
doing anything because you're just riding in a truck with me.

585
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:59.550
You could we wearing sweatpants,
the yellow hat.
Oh,

586
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:02.220
curious George.
Curious George.

587
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:07.640
I'm curious.
George W.
Bush.
Um,

588
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.980
so he says,
he tells these ladies,
he tells everybody,
he goes,

589
00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:13.440
if you run out of fucking whatever the fuck we were feeding him,

590
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.470
make sure you're not in their wheelhouse because then they just going to chomp

591
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:21.000
down on you.
Uh,
because they're,
they're lunatics,
right?

592
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.420
So I forget what the fuck you said.
So these,
these,

593
00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:27.600
these ditzy ladies go over there and she tried,

594
00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:31.140
she runs out of fucking grass and then she turns around and tries to do a selfie

595
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:33.780
and this thing came down and just chomped her shoulder.

596
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.990
She kind of pulled away quick enough.
I remember she had some sort of,
yeah,

597
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.470
just like nipped her or whatever it was.
Yeah.
It was the greatest thing ever.

598
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:43.860
She came back to the talk.
She was like,
oh my God,
it's,

599
00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:47.670
you see that it's just totally good.
My shoulder.

600
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:52.320
And then the fucking curious George Guy had shades on and he just so everybody

601
00:37:52.321 --> 00:37:56.820
can hear me.
Just went,
I fucking told you.
I was like,

602
00:37:56.821 --> 00:38:01.320
I love this guy.
Well,
I fucking told you.
There you go.

603
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.390
That was a good time.
We went from mom's birthday.
That was nice.
Yeah.

604
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:08.840
If you want to get shit faced again and look at a Yak,
I mean I'm up.

605
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.150
There was a Yak,
there was Yakety Yak.

606
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.350
<v 5>Okay.</v>

607
00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.230
<v 1>No yours.
Oh,
don't talk back.</v>

608
00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.840
Can imagine all those people who learned to play the fucking saxophone in the

609
00:38:22.841 --> 00:38:24.610
50s thinking that that was never going to end.

610
00:38:24.611 --> 00:38:28.990
There was always a saxophone solo and then all of a sudden it just fucking
ended,

611
00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:33.700
you know,
unless you were in Chicago or raw earth,
wind and fire,
who else had him?

612
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:38.800
Lionel Richie's band it,
right?
The commodores.
Yeah,
he was a horn player.

613
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:41.170
Wasn't he Lionel Richie?
Yeah,

614
00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.700
I dunno Nia.
Oh my God.

615
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:50.780
Even with me too fucking long.
How do you not know that?
How do you,

616
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.690
you supposed to know everything that is black.
Seriously?

617
00:38:53.691 --> 00:38:56.240
Am I supposed to know everything about the commodores?

618
00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.570
I need doors and I love it.
Go easy.

619
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.760
Like Sunday morning.
Sorry.
Let me see something.

620
00:39:04.761 --> 00:39:06.410
I'm gonna look this fucking shit up right now.

621
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.800
This podcast is officially over you just fucking hanging out with us right now.

622
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.670
Lyondell quiet Lionel Richie Horn.

623
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.940
Lionel Richie's,
uh,

624
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.200
<v 0>video video.</v>

625
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:31.550
<v 1>Why on which you are a song.
I know he played the fee.
Played some covered now</v>

626
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.360
was it saxophone?
There's only so many orange,
right?
I mean there is,

627
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:41.980
there's not an infinite amount of horns.
Saxophone,
Lionel Richie,

628
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.990
saxophone,
the Alto Sax.
There you go.
Wait,
wait.

629
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:52.240
Does he play it?
No.
And he was in the commodores.
He was like,
no,
he was,

630
00:39:52.241 --> 00:39:55.240
he's like Phil Collins.
Phil Collins is playing drums it off 70 singing.

631
00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.970
But I don't know.
I don't think he played at Lionel Richie.
Oh,

632
00:40:00.971 --> 00:40:05.080
that's somebody playing.
Hello?
Unless Alto Sec.
No,
but he played the fucking horn.

633
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:10.180
Fine evidence.
Where are the receipts?
You want to bet?
Yeah.
How much five bucks.

634
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.110
Come on.
20 bucks.
But your 50 bucks.

635
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:19.570
$50 on whether Lionel Richie play the saxophone.
That's so dumb.

636
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.640
<v 0>I know we did.</v>

637
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:27.230
<v 1>No,
he didn't.
Yes he did.
No,
isn't that funny?</v>

638
00:40:27.231 --> 00:40:30.080
You're scrolling through Google images because I'm,
I'm not,
I'm not,

639
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:34.070
I didn't single image Lionel Richie playing any kind of Horn,

640
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:38.300
French Saxo uh,

641
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.000
any of that sac.
So

642
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.850
hello my doors.
Orange section.

643
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.190
<v 0>Here we go.
You motherfucker.</v>

644
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.360
<v 1>He didn't take play the horn.
I've seen the video.
He could play it.</v>

645
00:40:57.361 --> 00:41:00.870
Find it.
Oh look there he was playing the piano.

646
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:04.310
He's multitalented.
Well,

647
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.840
we know that could probably cook too.

648
00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:12.940
I know we did.
Hmm.
Doesn't look like it.

649
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:20.140
Well,
none.

650
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.970
None of these are picking their,

651
00:41:22.971 --> 00:41:27.290
that's not Lionel Richie playing any kind of horn.
Oh yeah.
Who the fuck is that?

652
00:41:27.291 --> 00:41:30.560
That's not Lionel Richie.
I know he did it.
I know we did.

653
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.040
I know I saw it.
I'm 50 bucks.

654
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.290
Wait a minute.
What am I somebody listens to?

655
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:41.550
Is knows without a doubt.

656
00:41:41.551 --> 00:41:44.910
If I'm right or if I'm wrong and they're going to let me know.

657
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.970
You're on Google right now and there's nothing that has come up.

658
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.590
Yeah,
but I'm a moron.
Well,
obviously.
Oh really?
Jesus.

659
00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.270
I know we did.
I know.
I saw him playing the fucking thing.

660
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:02.850
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

661
00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:06.840
<v 1>Wait,
who's who's the lead singer of the commodores?
Because it wasn't him.</v>

662
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.520
I that I do not know.
Alright.

663
00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:14.690
Fuck this commodores brick house.

664
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:19.620

<v 1>It makes me know.
I swear to God what they choose.</v>

668
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:36.920
Someone who can't say because that's that fucking hipster,

669
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:41.580
white fucking silver lake horse.
Shit.

679
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.720
I wish I was playing it though.
Maybe he's just like posing.

680
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:41.300
Go Fuck Yourself.
Oh my God.

681

It's him.
That's 50 bucks.

682
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.800
All right.
That's the end of the podcast.

683
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.020
That's how you make 50 bucks off your wife.

Lyft knows that their drivers are what keeps them moving.
Oh Geez.

697
00:44:46.821 --> 00:44:48.120
I really honor that they need,

698
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:53.160
so they do everything they can to make sure where their drivers are happy on

699
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:53.940
every trip.

700
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.020
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better.

701
00:44:58.170 --> 00:44:59.940
Lift believes that being a ride,

702
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:03.480
sharing drivers should be fun if you're having a good time.

703
00:45:03.481 --> 00:45:04.830
So are the passengers.

704
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:10.020
Lift was also first to offer in APP tipping.
When you drive for Lyft,

705
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:11.880
you keep 100% of the tips.

706
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.900
Drivers have been paid over $200 million in tips since the feature was first

707
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:17.660
introduced.
Express payloads.

708
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:22.670
Drivers get paid almost instantly instead of waiting weeks almost instantly,

709
00:45:23.671 --> 00:45:24.960
instantly.
There's a loophole there.

710
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.140
Lyft has even taken the guesswork out of pickups.

711
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:33.141
The new amp amp device uses color coding to help passengers find their driveway.

712
00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:37.020
You could earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
One,
earn more money,

713
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.800
drive mower.
It's never been easier to give yourself a raise.

714
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:43.740
It's a simple formula.
Happy drivers mean happy passengers.

715
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.350

thaw.
See meow.

721
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.760
Everyone at some point has wished they could have.
They could just have beer,

722
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.390
wine or liquor delivered.
Yeah,
me too.
I just was,

723
00:46:18.391 --> 00:46:20.730
I could sit in the sun and drink it every random Wednesday,

724
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.750
one Wednesday a month did.

725
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.800
You can just get drunk in public and you get your little cards to the cops

726
00:46:25.801 --> 00:46:30.570
cannot arrest you.
Well,
someone finally decided to do something about it.
Uh,

727
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.960
introducing Southie.
Meow.
The alcohol delivery APP.

728
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:39.960
Southie delivers your favorite wine and beer and liquor right to your door on

729
00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:43.320

Nobody would have to see it.

731
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:49.830
It's Uber for alcohol.
Now lift just said,

732
00:46:49.831 --> 00:46:53.190

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.193
from while ago.

776
00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:37.420
<v 9>He has said it Glam March Exxon.</v>

777
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:50.080
It's been weeks and I got up by

778
00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.760
the silence.
Sometimes it's nice to just be

779
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.233
shut

780
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.250
down too.

781
00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:23.190

He came over here.</v>

785
00:50:38.701 --> 00:50:42.120
There was already people he cut off the fucking hands cause they couldn't find

786
00:50:42.121 --> 00:50:42.954
gold.

787
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:48.060
We celebrate him cause he was kind of white even though I think he was from

788
00:50:48.061 --> 00:50:51.750
Spain and if he came to Boston and try to get a job,

789
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:56.640
he'd be really fucked with most of the people he'd interview with.
Um,

790
00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:57.723
what's good?

<v 6>Alright.</v>

797
00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:22.750
Discovered America Fall you volume people who have never picked up a history

798
00:51:22.751 --> 00:51:27.670
book.
He sale in 1492 he sailed the ocean blue.

799
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:30.310
He thought he was going to the West indies.

800
00:51:30.311 --> 00:51:35.311
This is like there once was a man from Nantucket there once was a man from Spain

801
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:42.100
who had in his balls a pain.
He couldn't get laid.

802
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.770
He tried every day.
So he said,
fuck it,
I'm going to sail.

803
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:50.590
So I have something to talk about.
I Dunno guys.

804
00:51:50.591 --> 00:51:54.070
This is funny to me and I'm buzzing pretty fucking good and I really don't give

805
00:51:54.071 --> 00:51:57.400
a shit.
I do give a shit.
I care.
I care about you.

806
00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.220
And how did you enjoy Columbia steak?
What did you do?

807
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:05.320
Did you put on like a fucking George Washington wig and stand on the neck of the

808
00:52:05.321 --> 00:52:09.660
tennis person that you know in celebration of all the great things he did?
Um,

809
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.690
I've always had difficulty once I got past a certain age with the fact that that

810
00:52:13.691 --> 00:52:17.140
guy,
they said,
he discovered,
he discovered,

811
00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:22.090
he discovered it for Europe.
He didn't discover it.
There was already people here.

812
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:27.070
You know what I mean?
Just sitting here,
living off the land,
you know,

813
00:52:27.071 --> 00:52:31.420
a little mud flap over their junk using up every bit of the animal.

814
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.860
They did nothing wrong.

815
00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:36.520
That's the overcorrection of native Americans where they've now become like

816
00:52:36.521 --> 00:52:40.180
these God like people were,
none of them were bad.
You know,

817
00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:44.950
none of them would have fucked you out of your four zero one k money had they

818
00:52:44.951 --> 00:52:49.410
understood what a 401k was and could tie a tie.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

819
00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:53.260
people are people.
Let's,
let's,
let's,
let's get down to brass tacks here,
people.

820
00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.573
All right.

821
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.990
Just because you're sitting there floss in with the fucking bison tendon doesn't

822
00:52:58.991 --> 00:53:02.170
mean that,
you know,
if you had a car,

823
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:07.840
you wouldn't get a little grabby on the first date.
All right?
Okay.

824
00:53:07.841 --> 00:53:11.980
And if you can't do the math on that,
that I can't help you.
Um,
yeah,

825
00:53:11.981 --> 00:53:16.630
it's Christopher Columbus Day.
Mary,
go Vespucci remember,

826
00:53:16.631 --> 00:53:18.460
I'll let that fucking awful history stuff.

827
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.390
You sit in there with half a fucking erection looking at some chick next to you

828
00:53:22.391 --> 00:53:27.391
and there's some guy in a Goddamn tweed coat talking about a Vinny del Negro.

829
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.610
What was the other,
what was it?
What was the other guy?

830
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.810
The other world explorer.

831
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:38.190
It was a merry go Vespucci it was Christopher Columbus and then there was a guy

832
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:41.280
who had like a Vinny del Negro name,
but it wasn't Vinny del Negro.

833
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:42.270
But now that's in my head,

834
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:44.070
so I'll never be able to think of what the fuck was it?

835
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:49.530
Was it Marcus the Lafayette?
Was that him?

836
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.280
He wasn't the trader in the revolutionary war.

837
00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:57.550
That was benedict Arnold.
Mark the Lafayette.

838
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.930
Did he start Marquette University?
He did something.

839
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:04.950
He wasn't with Lewis and Clark,
I don't fucking know.

840
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.280
You know what's funny is just all the shit that was done to create this country

841
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:12.660
and they kind of boil it down to like 14 people.
These guys sailed up a river.

842
00:54:12.661 --> 00:54:17.610
This guy found it.
This guy said,
I can't tell a lie.
And a the other guy said,

843
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:20.280
hey,
why don't you lay off the black people for a minute?
You know,

844
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:25.281
and that's pretty much the first 200 years of history in this country as far as

845
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:31.080
I can tell.
You know?
And for all you Europeans listening and all you Australians,

846
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:33.360
that doesn't mean your country's better.
Alright,

847
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.650
so fuck you and your fish and chips and your vegemite sandwiches because nobody

848
00:54:37.651 --> 00:54:40.770
gives a shit.
All right?
You just as filthy as we are,

849
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:47.850
<v 9>headache
pounding,
months,</v>

850
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:56.430
bodies,
weekend

851
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:06.720
with
smoke.

852
00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:10.340
<v 11>Hey,
how come you can't protest without getting teargassed shot at you</v>

853
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.190
<v 6>all around the world.</v>

854
00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:16.810
<v 11>Get Out.
They act like you.
You know,
we want to hear from our people.</v>

855
00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.200
And you go out there,
he just sitting out there,
all you do with it,

856
00:55:20.201 --> 00:55:24.970
you got signs in your chanting and then the cops come down there and they start

857
00:55:24.971 --> 00:55:27.430
pushing people around and they'd throw fucking tear guests.

858
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:28.870
<v 6>Okay,</v>

859
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:33.040
<v 11>I don't understand why,
why can't you do that?
Why aren't you allowed to protest?</v>

860
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:34.151
Look,

861
00:55:34.151 --> 00:55:37.060
I understand if you go down there and you start breaking windows and that type

862
00:55:37.061 --> 00:55:40.450
of shit.
But I actually believe,

863
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:43.510
and I know you guys are gonna think that I'm paranoid.
If I was in power,

864
00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:45.440
I would just say,
hey,
I will,

865
00:55:45.441 --> 00:55:49.270
Gq Sun has set them out there and have him throw a rock through a window so we

866
00:55:49.271 --> 00:55:53.710
can look justified when we get rid of these fucking people out here.
Um,

867
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.980
<v 6>Adam,
sorry,
I'm going back down the fucking rat hole again.</v>

868
00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:03.260
Somebody sent me a great rant that this guy went on on a news program and he was

869
00:56:03.261 --> 00:56:05.170
talking about the bankers.
Uh,

870
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:09.860
cause I can't even watch news right now with our government might shut down in a

871
00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.510
couple of days.
But this guy was basically going off saying all that banker shit.

872
00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.580
<v 11>I was trying to say a few years ago when I started watching those videos and</v>

873
00:56:18.581 --> 00:56:19.720
everybody was saying,
Oh yeah,

874
00:56:19.721 --> 00:56:24.520
these are fucking fat guys living in their mother's who?
A,

875
00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:26.740
they don't have any lives.
And you just,
you know,

876
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:30.430
you're drinking the Koolaid and all this shit.
I look a lot of that stuff.

877
00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:34.780
We never landed on the moon.
I'll give you all that shit.
Okay.

878
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.270
Maybe all of that stuff.
Nine 11 is an inside job.

879
00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:40.870
I'm not talking about any of that fucking crap,
but that bankers shit.

880
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:46.150
I'm telling you,
that banker shit is dead on,

881
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:50.110
dead fucking on.
It's not the left.
It's not the right,

882
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.130
it's those cuts right in the middle with money on both sides of the ball.

883
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.510
It's those guys.
And,
um,
I have to tell you,
dude,
the,

884
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.760
the fact that the president only makes 400 grand a year,

885
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:05.570
and that just the way they frame it,
like,
oh,
he's a public servant in bookbub.

886
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:08.410
It's,
it's the biggest crock of shit out there.

887
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:11.480
The only person who would take that job,

888
00:57:11.481 --> 00:57:14.750
you'd have to be the biggest fucking yes man on the planet just to get there.

889
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:17.360
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

890
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:17.820
<v 11>You,</v>

891
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.780
who the fuck would run for a job where it costs 100 million to get it so you can

892
00:57:21.781 --> 00:57:23.250
make 400 grand a year.

893
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:24.680
<v 4>Okay.</v>

894
00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.600
<v 11>Yeah.
That isn't a red flag to anybody.</v>

895
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:30.290
Then you get to go around giving speeches $1 million,

896
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:33.620
a whack like that isn't yet a kickback for fucking pushing through whatever they

897
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.680
wanted.
I just think it's,
it's so beyond corrupt.

898
00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:38.293
<v 4>MMM.</v>

899
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.470
<v 11>And I used to think shit,</v>

900
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:45.910
like I can't believe we're letting these pencil pushing banking policies push us

901
00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:49.330
around,
but it's not them.
It's the fact that people will do anything for money.

902
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:53.710
So when you have that kind of money,
you can hire psychos and uh,
you know,

903
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:56.620
I dunno,
you get that,

904
00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:01.000
you get that Lincoln town car ride the convertible in Dallas.
All right.

905
00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:03.520
I spoke about it vaguely,
but you know what I'm saying?

906
00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:09.253
<v 9>Freedom.</v>

907
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:19.700
<v 10>That's fine.</v>

908
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:28.490
You put the handgun down the back down again

909
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.310
<v 11>going on.
It is,
uh,
Bill burn it.</v>

910
00:58:52.311 --> 00:58:56.630
Just the Monday morning podcast and it sounds really fucking loud.
Why is that?

911
00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:02.120
Why is that?
Because my volume is up.
There we go.
I'm not red lining.
Am I?
Hello.

912
00:59:02.121 --> 00:59:06.320
Test One,
two C.
I usually do that part before I get on the fucking thing.

913
00:59:06.321 --> 00:59:09.590
But I didn't,
I didn't this time cause I'm doing it,
uh,

914
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.070
on Sunday night because for some reason I have the whole apartment to myself

915
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.610
other than my dog chilling out and a whatever.

916
00:59:16.611 --> 00:59:20.960
This is the Monday morning podcast.
How are you?

917
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.730
<v 4>Oh,
that's fantastic.
I'm actually in a great fucking mood.</v>

918
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:32.020
I don't sound like it.
I'm in a great mood.
You know why?
Because,
well,

919
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:34.850
because of a number of things.
Okay.
First of all,

920
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:39.790
<v 11>and as any man,
a happy story,
I just don't want to forget to tell the story.</v>

921
00:59:39.791 --> 00:59:44.791
I was out at a friend's birthday party and a ranting about the Yankees.

922
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.540
Um,
my hatred of the Yankees is,
it's literally,
it's getting embarrassing.

923
00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:52.990
It's like at a child like level.
Um,

924
00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:56.770
I th I can infuriate it every time somebody brings up the Yankees and they don't

925
00:59:56.771 --> 00:59:58.960
mention that they've spent $200 million,

926
00:59:58.961 --> 01:00:02.950
why wouldn't they be up two games to none over the fucking angels?
Okay.

927
01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:07.240
It just annoys me.
You know,
I already fucking,
I just,

928
01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:10.450
but I have to stop because people out here don't give a fuck.

929
01:00:10.451 --> 01:00:14.140
And I'm talking to like some guy from fucking Milwaukee and he's like,
yeah,

930
01:00:14.141 --> 01:00:17.650
you know,
uh,
you know,
you guys kind of take our players too,

931
01:00:17.651 --> 01:00:20.230
so I don't really give a shit.
And I'm like,
no,

932
01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.240
but the Yankees are in our division.
What did we,

933
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.100
what the fuck are we supposed to do?
You know,

934
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:28.770
we're trying to end an 80 year curse that one fucking time,
right?
This pen,

935
01:00:28.771 --> 01:00:31.720
a $200 million.
What are we supposed to,
baseball's not stopping them.

936
01:00:31.721 --> 01:00:34.090
What the fuck was he looking?
Here I go again.
Here I go again.

937
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:38.080
Just like that awful white snake song.
So anyway,
so I'm at this birthday party,

938
01:00:38.081 --> 01:00:41.890
right?
I'm sitting there,
I'm having a couple of Budweiser's,
you know,

939
01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.780
because I want to,
you know,
and this lady comes over,
you know,

940
01:00:46.781 --> 01:00:51.040
it's the birthday time.
Happy Birthday,
dear touche bag.
Right?

941
01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:54.310
And they bring that out,
not douche bag,
but they bring the fucking cake over.

942
01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:57.270
Okay.
And then little Susie,
Miss,
uh,

943
01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.000
cunty box starts cutting up the fucking cake.
You know,

944
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:03.820
there's always that fucking,
you know,
soccer mom to be,

945
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.540
who just has to all of a sudden start fucking running things like the fucking

946
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:08.890
control freak that she is.

947
01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.970
So I'm sitting there drinking beer and she comes over with this fucking piece of

948
01:01:12.971 --> 01:01:17.860
cake and she just sets it down.
Hey,
you want a piece of cake?
And I'm like,
no,

949
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:20.230
no,
I don't.
And she goes,

950
01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:23.410
why not first red flag,

951
01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:28.510
then I'm dealing with a pushy cont.
Would you like some cake?
No.
No,
I wouldn't.

952
01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:29.950
Why not?

953
01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:35.110
Because I f you fucking ask me that and that's what my inside said.
No,

954
01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:37.470
I don't want cake.
I got to give you a followup find.

955
01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:41.680
You want to follow up fucking answer.
I'll tell you why.
Because the cake is blue.

956
01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.720
It's a blue cake.
She goes,
that's not the cake.
It's the deal.
That's just the die.

957
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:51.130
And she walks away and leaves the cake there.
Stupidest fucking response ever.

958
01:01:51.131 --> 01:01:56.030
That's not the cake.
It's the dye.
You mean the dye in the cake?
Oh,

959
01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.070
I all I got,
oh,
I get it.
I get it.
All I do is just eat the cake part.

960
01:01:59.071 --> 01:02:01.080
I don't eat the blue part.
Exactly.

961
01:02:01.081 --> 01:02:04.770
Where do I enter the cake to get to the part that actually looks like fucking

962
01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:09.630
cake and doesn't look like a,
you spilled one of those roofie drinks on it,

963
01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.090
aren't just fucking annoyed me.

964
01:02:12.091 --> 01:02:15.720
And then I'm watching a bouncing around just Hanan people cake with his stupid

965
01:02:15.721 --> 01:02:20.070
skirt and her smart looking fucking shoes.
You know,

966
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.950
little miss fucking PTA.
She just,

967
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.340
she does look like the kind of fucking broad that you know,

968
01:02:26.341 --> 01:02:29.520
he's got nothing better to do.
This is,
this is her future.

969
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:33.180
She's going to have a couple of fucking kids and she's going to be all involved

970
01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:37.110
in the fucking school and she's going to know everybody's God damn names and

971
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:37.944
just,
ah,

972
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.630
and it's just going to be her agenda and her agenda is going to fucking pass,

973
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.800
you know,
the same way I said no to the cake.
And this twat takes,

974
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:50.520
does not take no for an answer.
Would you like some cake?
No,
I wouldn't.
You know,

975
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.100
why is it socially unacceptable for me?

976
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:57.720
I should just pick that fucking piece of cake up with the plate and just mushed

977
01:02:57.721 --> 01:02:59.310
it.
I said,

978
01:02:59.311 --> 01:03:03.000
I didn't write in her fucking face there.

979
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.930
My faith is blue.
Oh,

980
01:03:06.931 --> 01:03:11.720
that's just the die fucking Douche bag.
So anyways,

981
01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:16.440
sorry.
I had to get that out.
I actually had a great,
had a great week,
you know,

982
01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:22.140
um,
as most of you know,
I had a,
had a bad experience on us air this past week.

983
01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:26.400
They charge 25 bucks for the first bag and a,
when I landed,

984
01:03:26.401 --> 01:03:31.210
I had to wait almost an hour to get my bag,
you know?
And,
uh,
yeah,

985
01:03:31.211 --> 01:03:35.280
I actually got the email and I promised you guys I was going to complain to him.

986
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:38.340
You know,
and I know what you guys are probably thinking,
oh,

987
01:03:38.341 --> 01:03:42.390
it's a fucking corporation.
What the fuck are you going to do?
This is what I did.

988
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:47.210
Okay.
You know,
because you,
you get,
you have to the,
I'm telling you,
you,

989
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.910
we have to start looking psycho.
I'm actually using the word weak,

990
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:54.000
which I never do.
I believe that,
uh,

991
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.490
people need to start questioning some of the,

992
01:03:56.491 --> 01:04:00.960
some of the demands that these corporations are making on people because it's

993
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:04.920
getting ridiculous.
You're sitting on a flight,
there's 300 people on the flight.

994
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:10.130
Nobody wants to pay 25 bucks for the first bag yet everybody does because

995
01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:15.000
nobody's bitching or they take the,
uh,
every man for themself route.
Well,

996
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:19.140
I'll just fucking bring one shirt and a jock strap and that way I'll shove it

997
01:04:19.141 --> 01:04:22.440
underneath the seat and I'll save my own ass,
you know?

998
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.160
And those of you who do that,
your own little selfish fucking way,

999
01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:30.150
I hope you're married,
that chick with the blue cake.
Um,
so anyways,
as you notice,

1000
01:04:30.151 --> 01:04:32.700
I have a temper.
If you're new to my podcast and I don't give a fuck,

1001
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:35.750
I think it's refreshing.
Just sit here.
Yeah,

1002
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.900
that's the kind of shit that kills you.

1003
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:39.960
A little blue KC moments fucking kill you have to,
why?

1004
01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:41.340
He just hold onto it and you just like,

1005
01:04:41.341 --> 01:04:45.750
well she's kind of pushy and then you slowly just start eating the fucking cake,

1006
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:46.703
you know,

1007
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.710
sound of children's wet feet running across concrete as you sit there and that

1008
01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:56.340
stupid fucking hourglass shape pool.
Right outside of that.

1009
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.440
And is that what you guys do out there in the suburbs?

1010
01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:03.510
Some sort of rock formation,
artificial waterfall.
Um,

1011
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.210
anyways,
what the fuck am I talking about?
See,

1012
01:05:06.211 --> 01:05:09.930
what you have to do is you have to learn how to complain to these corporate

1013
01:05:09.931 --> 01:05:11.760
fucks.
Okay.
Um,

1014
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.240
like here's an example of someone that actually writing,
you know,

1015
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:18.430
what do I really have time to read that?
Do I want to read it?

1016
01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.710
What do you guys want to hear?
You want to hear the way not to do it.

1017
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:23.020
Like one of those old little fucking school film strips.

1018
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:28.930
You know Eddie,
correct way,
Susie.
Wrong way.
All right,
here's the wrong way.

1019
01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:32.320
A bill.
Here's a story regarding,
uh,
poor service.

1020
01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.490
About two years ago I took my,
uh,
my family wife and two sons,

1021
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:39.400
ages six and four at the time,
social security number's nine,
seven,

1022
01:05:39.401 --> 01:05:42.490
eight up to New Hampshire in a,
the white mountains.

1023
01:05:42.491 --> 01:05:46.300
And we went to the wild west themed amusement parks so we could have some fun.

1024
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.000
Now,
generally I'm a pretty angry guy,

1025
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.200
but I try not to be so fucking miserable around my kids because I don't want

1026
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:54.460
them to be the same as me.

1027
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:59.910
So I try and act like a normal human brain being and let shit go when I get a,

1028
01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:02.890
when I get fucked to a certain degree.
Dude,

1029
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:05.660
I can't even tell you how much I relate to that,
you know?
Um,

1030
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:10.000
of course my wife will encourage this as well.
I'm just calm down.

1031
01:06:10.001 --> 01:06:14.980
Everything will be all right.
I don't understand why you get so upset.
Um,

1032
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:17.320
he literally said,
insert your chip voice there.
Of course,
you know,

1033
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:19.600
I was going to do that.
Um,
anyway,
uh,

1034
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:23.980
we decided it's time to get some lunch at the old wild west show and we go into

1035
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:27.340
some shitty little pizza stand inside the park that's in quotes.

1036
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:31.950
You can already feel his anger and the line's pretty long.
But,
uh,

1037
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.910
it's lunch so it's expected.

1038
01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:38.230
I then tell me wife and kids to wear it outside as I will order for the kids.

1039
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:40.600
And so the kids don't get antsy,
you know,

1040
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.840
take them over to some fucking struggling actor dressed his Winnie the pooh

1041
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:46.090
while I go get the pizza slices.
Basically,

1042
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.640
it's not going to start compensating for my fucking bed.

1043
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:52.780
Reading out loud skills as I'm just going to start paraphrasing anyway.
So,
uh,

1044
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:54.940
as I waited about 20 minutes to order,

1045
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.710
I'm looking at the cluster fuck that's going on and passing for an organ,

1046
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:02.560
an organization behind the counter.
Um,

1047
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:07.480
apparently some mid 40 ish year old douche bag who does the hiring has decided

1048
01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:11.530
it would be great to hire all 20 year old chicks or chicks in their twenties

1049
01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:14.410
with Russian based,
uh,
from Russian,

1050
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.550
from Russia based on their hotness.
Sorry guys.
Um,
and they were pretty hot.
Well,

1051
01:07:21.551 --> 01:07:23.530
I'm a married man with my wife and kids with me.

1052
01:07:23.531 --> 01:07:25.940
So at this point I don't give a fuck how,
um,

1053
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.480
I don't give a fuck as I'm not banging any of them anyway.

1054
01:07:29.481 --> 01:07:34.360
So I finally ordered and I begin to wait.
After about 40 minutes of waiting,

1055
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:38.920
my oldest son comes in and tells me his mother sent him to us where the food is.

1056
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.260
Now,
keep in mind that this is a full 60 minutes with no food in his mind.

1057
01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:46.600
So I tell him to go back and I'll be out soon.

1058
01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:50.380
Now my wife sends him back because she doesn't want to lose the prime dirty

1059
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:52.480
table that she has cleaned herself.

1060
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:55.480
Those amusement park tables of the worst.

1061
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:59.980
So I ask in a polite way when my food will,
when my food will be ready,

1062
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.750
Kenny fucking eat.
And this Russian looks at me and says,

1063
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:08.680
in five minutes,
I then watch her go over there and reread my slip.

1064
01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:12.610
And then I watch her sprinkled the bullshit toppings that I asked for on my

1065
01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:17.300
piece of cardboard shit than I'm paying $5 for to begin with.

1066
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:21.560
And she begins to cook it.
I then asked her if that's what happened,

1067
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.220
basically saying,
did you forget my fucking order?
Um,

1068
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:30.350
and she says,
no.
So I'm fucking starving.
And I'm furious.

1069
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:32.590
So I start acting like a fucking asshole.

1070
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.100
And I start talking really loud saying that I've been here for 40 minutes

1071
01:08:37.101 --> 01:08:41.090
waiting and I'm watching people leave before me who ordered after me and then I

1072
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:44.890
say,
just tell me,
Jill,
my phone's ringing in the other room.

1073
01:08:44.891 --> 01:08:47.090
I'd have to ignore it.
He goes,
uh,

1074
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.770
just tell me that what you did.
Wait,

1075
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.240
just tell me that you did one.

1076
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:58.241
I know you did and that you made a mistake and that you just made my pizza.

1077
01:08:58.371 --> 01:09:02.300
You basically Joe Pesci in casino.

1078
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.400
I'm going to give you the money.

1079
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:07.820
Just tell me your gambled you fucking degenerate piece of shit.
Right?

1080
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.470
So it's at this moment as I should've realized that I'm 36 years old at the
time,

1081
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:16.490
about six two and 200 plus pound yelling at probably a five foot 10 inch skinny

1082
01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:21.080
Russian chick who's about 22 years old.
But of course I did.
Um,

1083
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:25.580
however some country,
45 year old chick sure did and starts,

1084
01:09:25.581 --> 01:09:28.670
I guess this is another customer and starts to butt in and tell me to leave her

1085
01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:29.420
alone.

1086
01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.710
I then blow up and tell it a minor on fucking business as well as you should

1087
01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:38.510
have.
Anyways,
I'm sorry that was a blue Cape woman seeping into this,

1088
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:41.870
ah,
tell her minor own fucking business and stay the fuck out of it.

1089
01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:47.140
And I turned around to the other 25 or so people waiting in our already paid

1090
01:09:47.151 --> 01:09:48.320
douchebags section,

1091
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:52.730
holding our slips and I try to garner some momentum and say something like,

1092
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:56.420
aren't you all waiting here to this?
This is ridiculous,
right?
Blah Blah Blah.

1093
01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.760
I was then I noticed my six year old with his eyes and mouth wide open looking

1094
01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:05.240
at me and either or shame,
I'm still not sure which.

1095
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:08.330
So I asked you as another angry guide,

1096
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:12.020
you think I should have just kept my mouth closed and continued to be part of

1097
01:10:12.021 --> 01:10:17.021
some fuck ups scenario in which some retard wants to fuck a young Russian and I

1098
01:10:17.241 --> 01:10:21.770
have to suffer by receiving poor service or continued to call out bullshit when

1099
01:10:21.771 --> 01:10:26.360
I see it.
All right?
See if you are 100% in the right there.
All right?

1100
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:28.870
Uh,
no,
you shouldn't start screaming and yes,

1101
01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:32.680
she shouldn't do that in front of your kid.
Um,

1102
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.770
what you should've done it was you should have asked to see a manager and he

1103
01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:39.590
should've complained.
And uh,

1104
01:10:39.591 --> 01:10:44.591
what you should've done was basically there's a magic word that you use in there

1105
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.340
and it's not fuck,
it's unacceptable.
Okay?

1106
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.920
You just have to keep your cool and you say,
listen,

1107
01:10:51.921 --> 01:10:55.880
I've been waiting here for 50 minutes for a slice of pizza.
Okay.

1108
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.480
And when they go,
oh,
it's coming right up.
Just be,
it's unacceptable.

1109
01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:02.330
I just saw you put toppings,
you read my slip,
you put topics.

1110
01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:04.730
I feel that's what happened.
I want to speak to a manager.

1111
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.450
And then when the manager comes over,
you just tell them in a nice,
calm tone,

1112
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.110
what's going on,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
That's the way to go about it.

1113
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:14.580
And you just say I some sort of compensation.

1114
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.340
And when they say that they cannot give you any compensation,

1115
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:21.210
and you just keep saying that is unacceptable and you keep asking for people

1116
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.370
above them.
If they are not there,

1117
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.680
you get a phone number and when you get a phone number,

1118
01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:28.650
then you'll write a fucking email and you have to go that route.

1119
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:32.730
And I swear to God,
good shit happens.
Why?

1120
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:37.650
Why would I know that?
Because this is the second half of my,
uh,
US Airways story.

1121
01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.100
All right?
They basically,
you know,

1122
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:45.360
they sent me to their Internet to complain that I had to wait an hour for my

1123
01:11:45.361 --> 01:11:49.860
fucking bag that I paid 25 bucks for.
So I go onto their website.
All right?

1124
01:11:49.861 --> 01:11:52.440
And I think I explained this last week,
so you know,
what do I get?

1125
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:56.980
What do I get from these assholes?
They have a whole page where as I'm,

1126
01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.660
I'm trying to register to complain,
they're sucking out even more information.

1127
01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:03.750
So I just decided that that was unacceptable.
I'm not fucking doing that.

1128
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.500
So I called the number and I called the people at,
at a US air.

1129
01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:11.310
I said very nicely.
I said,
look,
I understand that you,
you don't make the policy.

1130
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.660
I'm not upset with you.

1131
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:17.130
I'm upset with the guy sitting on the yard with the US airways tie tech right

1132
01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:21.570
now.
Um,
sunning himself with my $25,

1133
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:26.460
you know,
and a,
I want my money back.
And they said,
well,
go to the website.
I said,

1134
01:12:26.461 --> 01:12:29.040
I don't want to give you all the information.
And The lady said,
well,

1135
01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:31.050
that's the only way you can get your money back.
And I said,
well,

1136
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:33.660
that's unacceptable.
I'd like to speak to somebody else.

1137
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.620
So she gives me somebody else.
They tried to take me to the back to the website.

1138
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.350
I say,
that's unacceptable.
I don't want to give you all that information.

1139
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.980
There's no reason for me.
You have to give you all that information.
She goes,

1140
01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:47.910
well,
that's our procedure.
I said,
that's unacceptable.
So finally,

1141
01:12:47.911 --> 01:12:51.450
after just keep saying unacceptable and I wouldn't curse,
I didn't lose my cool,

1142
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.730
I wouldn't get off the phone.
All of a sudden,

1143
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:58.140
now all of a sudden they have some new direct email to give me to some person at

1144
01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:02.250
us airways and all you have to do is leave my name the flight I was on,

1145
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:05.400
what the situation was and give them a call back number and they'll get back to

1146
01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:10.110
me within two days.
So this is the letter I sent him.
I said,

1147
01:13:10.111 --> 01:13:14.870
my name is William [inaudible].
I use William.
What I'm complaining.
Uh,

1148
01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:18.870
I flew us airways from uh,
Pittsburgh,
Los Angeles connected in Phoenix,

1149
01:13:18.871 --> 01:13:21.270
Arizona Sunday,
October 11th.

1150
01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:24.540
They pay the outrageous sum of $25 to have my first bag checked.

1151
01:13:24.541 --> 01:13:28.920
When I landed in Los Angeles,
I had to wait 55 minutes for my bag.

1152
01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:33.780
55 is capitalized as to stress that that is an outrageous amount of time.

1153
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:36.510
Anyways,
I said,
at no time during the hour long wait,

1154
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:40.410
did any employee of US Airways make any attempt to inform its customers?

1155
01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:43.470
That's what the problem was.
When I finally found an employee,

1156
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:47.730
I was told that US airways had employed a skeleton crew on this particular day.

1157
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:48.833
In other words,

1158
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.770
they were not enough people working that day to handle the workload.
Hence,

1159
01:13:52.771 --> 01:13:56.730
my girlfriend had to pay for parking at the airport and we had to sit for almost

1160
01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:00.420
an hour until the skeleton crew was able to get me,
get my bag to me.

1161
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:04.770
I fly every other weekend and recently flew to Sweden with my girlfriend on US

1162
01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:06.330
airways.
As a loyal customer,

1163
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:11.040
I need some sort of gesture on your part to show that you respect the fact that

1164
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:15.340
I use your airline and that you care about the service that you provide provide.

1165
01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:20.020
Therefore,
I feel I'm entitled to a full refund of my $25 bag fee.

1166
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:25.350
I would like to be contacted at this number between the hours of this and this,

1167
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:30.600
this Thursday,
October 15th to resolve this matter.
Sincerely,
William Byrd,
blah,

1168
01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:34.720
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
All right,
so I'm all geared up.

1169
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.090
I'm clearing my schedule for the four hour window.

1170
01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:41.530
Wait for this person to call fucking the next day.
I get an email.
Dear Mr. Byrd,

1171
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.090
due to the circumstances that you have described as a one time courtesy,

1172
01:14:46.091 --> 01:14:49.060
I f authorized a refund of your baggage fee.

1173
01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:54.130
Please allow up to 30 days for posting back to the original form of payment.

1174
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.051
Okay?
First of all,

1175
01:14:56.051 --> 01:14:59.110
what I love about this shit is they act like they're doing me a favor.

1176
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:03.070
Do the circumstances you have described as a one time courtesy.

1177
01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.250
<v 10>Okay?</v>

1178
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.490
<v 11>Now,
this isn't a courtesy.
This is standard business.</v>

1179
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.970
This isn't a one time courtesy.
This is an every time courtesy.

1180
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:15.860
I'm never waiting 55 minutes for my bag that I paid 25 bucks for.

1181
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.440
That's unacceptable.
It's unacceptable.

1182
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:23.060
Magic word people unacceptable.
But this is the great thing about corporations.

1183
01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:24.800
Even though I'm getting my money back,

1184
01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.860
they still gonna make me crawl through another hundred yards of shit.

1185
01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.880
This is the next paragraph.
Well,

1186
01:15:29.881 --> 01:15:34.670
customer relations is unable to view our refund department's computer system.

1187
01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.510
You may check the status of your refund via our website.
Uh,

1188
01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.640
click on the refund in inquiry ink link.

1189
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:48.230
Proceed to the check refund status link on the following screen.

1190
01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.660
Input your 13 digit ticket number,

1191
01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.960
please direct all future refund status inquiries,

1192
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:58.220
inquiries to our refund department.
So wait,

1193
01:15:58.221 --> 01:16:00.320
do I have to do all that shit?
They get my money back.

1194
01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:07.630
I guess that's the view,
the status of it.
It's going to take like a month.
So,

1195
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:11.710
uh,
but anyways,
there you go.
So I did that.

1196
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:19.910
I asked for my fucking money back.
That is James Brown in the background

1197
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:26.240
and I got my fucking 25 bucks back and I never quit.

1198
01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:36.830
Sorry.
I thought the Ahmed can quicker.
I can have it be a DJ.

1199
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:40.610
These fucking assholes,
man.
I got my fucking money back.

1200
01:16:40.611 --> 01:16:42.430
Like I had to go through a bunch of shit.
But I'm telling you,

1201
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:47.020
the key word is to say unacceptable.
It's fucking unacceptable.

1202
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:51.610
And you know what?
It is unacceptable.
It's unacceptable that you got to pay $25.

1203
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:55.780
It's,
it's all bullshit there.
They're charging $25.
You know why?

1204
01:16:55.781 --> 01:16:59.560
Because American Airlines did it and they got away with it and nobody fucking

1205
01:16:59.561 --> 01:17:04.520
complained.
I'm not saying you have to fucking complain,
but you should.
All right.

1206
01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:09.350
Nobody is sticking up for regular fucking people.
And I hope this little story,

1207
01:17:09.351 --> 01:17:14.270
we'll encourage you to come plane.
What is wrong with my voice up done?

1208
01:17:14.271 --> 01:17:14.961
Too many shows.

1209
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:19.961
How many times it's going to crack to complain when it's time to change.

1210
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:23.120
And he fucking Brady bunch fans out there.
So there you go.

1211
01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:27.310
I got my fucking money back,
I guess.
Although I have to check the status of it.

1212
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.370
Guarantee you I don't get it back.
And then I got to remind them,
oh yeah,

1213
01:17:31.371 --> 01:17:33.830
that's right.
And then they sit in the conference from Jesus Christ.

1214
01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.040
He's part of the 0.1% have actually checked the status of his fucking refund.

1215
01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:46.070
So that's the new me.
That's what the new me does.
The knew me.

1216
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.050
When I get fucked by a corporation,

1217
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.220
I do not lose my shit and curse the way I do on this thing.

1218
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.650
That's why I love this podcast.
I just vent.
Okay.

1219
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.130
The new me is I basically,
I,

1220
01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:03.390
I keep my cool and I just say that things are unacceptable and I want some sort

1221
01:18:03.561 --> 01:18:06.590
of resolution.
That's what I want.
And if you can't help me,

1222
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:09.020
if I would like to speak to the person above you,

1223
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.610
if there's no more person above you,

1224
01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.640
I want the name and number and email of the person that I can get in contact

1225
01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.750
with.
Okay?

1226
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:22.220
So I can have a resolution to this problem.
I'm telling you.

1227
01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.570
That's the way you got to do it.
So if I was at that park,

1228
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.470
I mean sometimes you got to let it go.
I mean,
you're at,

1229
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:35.350
you're at an amusement park.
Um,
I got to watch out.
My girlfriend's coming home.

1230
01:18:35.351 --> 01:18:38.810
We got to make sure mom's not here,
so I want to say cut her mom's here.

1231
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:43.700
That wouldn't be good.
Nino.
Hey,
what's up?
Are you by yourself?

1232
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:49.340
Okay,
so I can say cunt and not offend your mother.
Yes,

1233
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:52.940
I am back.
I'm getting the,
uh,
doing the podcast.
That's what I'm doing.

1234
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:57.110
Where you're coming from?
What do you mean you're not here?
What?

1235
01:18:57.111 --> 01:18:59.660
He's supposed to be on somebody else's podcast.
What are you cheating on me.

1236
01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:06.080
Okay.
What did you say?
You saw a good hair.

1237
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:10.700
Was that a good movie?
A good movie?
What is it about?

1238
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.230
Is it about hair?
That's good.
Oh my God.
I really enjoyed it.

1239
01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.060
People had good hair and other people didn't.
But in the end we realize,

1240
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:25.040
aren't we all just people?
I might have good hair,
but you have a better shirt.

1241
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.570
Oh my God,
I have to call my brother.
Well,

1242
01:19:30.571 --> 01:19:34.740
that's awesome.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
I had,
I actually had a great week.

1243
01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.570
I'm out here.

1244
01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.950
I was getting off the roads doing a standup six of the last seven weeks.

1245
01:19:40.951 --> 01:19:45.951
So as I mentioned last week that my surprise from my lovely girlfriend was that

1246
01:19:46.111 --> 01:19:51.070
I was going to rent a corvette convertible for the day.
Yes.

1247
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.150
Which is actually,

1248
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:56.530
it's was such a great gift because it was something that I could totally enjoy.

1249
01:19:56.531 --> 01:19:59.200
I'm a tell you something right now.
I know.
Shut up.

1250
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:03.970
You don't talk on the fucking podcast unless I talked to you.
What are you saying

1251
01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:07.980
was for you and

1252
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.420
<v 8>I got to participate in it.</v>

1253
01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:12.640
<v 11>Is that how you viewed that?
When I took you up to Pch,</v>

1254
01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:17.470
the fucking Pacific coast highway people vacation,
they fly out here to do that.

1255
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:21.490
And I took you up there in a corvette convertible with the fucking top down.

1256
01:20:21.491 --> 01:20:25.960
Like God Damn Steve Mcqueen.
We rolled right up there.
We had a wonderful lunch.

1257
01:20:25.961 --> 01:20:29.840
We watched people surfing out the fucking window on a,
on a,
on a,

1258
01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.690
on a Thursday,
Thursday.
Most people are at work.
It was awesome.

1259
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:38.780
Have I spoiled you that bad that you take that for granted?
No,
I just,

1260
01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.410
I thought it was more like a presence then.
Why?
Why?

1261
01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.750
Why are you belittling me on my podcast?

1262
01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:46.900
<v 8>Oh,
little you.
I just,
I just felt like it was more,</v>

1263
01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:50.240
it was like a present for you that I got to participate in and I loved it,

1264
01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.433
but it was like

1265
01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:53.840
<v 11>listen to towards fried to warm her way out of this.</v>

1266
01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:55.650
<v 8>It was just,
it was your,</v>

1267
01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:58.850
you have been talking about the corvette and the doing the thing like it was,

1268
01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:02.990
it was your thing that you really wanted to do and I was lucky enough that you

1269
01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:04.190
allowed me to participate

1270
01:21:04.210 --> 01:21:06.400
<v 11>forgetting the night and then he'd come over and your kiss.
Yeah.</v>

1271
01:21:06.401 --> 01:21:11.200
And that makes it all better.
Right.
Sweet.
Get out of here.
See what you just,

1272
01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.740
Oh,
I didn't have to do that.
I could've got done.

1273
01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:19.270
I could've gone a could have gone by myself.
Huh?

1274
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.940
You keep coming with me with that attitude,
like when I,
yeah,
I,
oh my God,

1275
01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.350
you really annoy me.

1276
01:21:26.650 --> 01:21:29.950
Then we went to the Hollywood hills and I took you like driving like fucking

1277
01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:32.050
James Dean and we thought we were going to go off the cliff,

1278
01:21:32.051 --> 01:21:34.720
but we didn't because of those fat fucking tires,

1279
01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.810
that a 22 times the size of the Prius.

1280
01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:42.810
<v 8>It was amazing.
I wasn't trying to go live a live,
it was not my intention.</v>

1281
01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:45.870
<v 11>No,
you did new.
This is what you did.
All of a sudden you started acting like a,</v>

1282
01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:48.210
Oh yeah.
It was really a present for you.
Yeah.

1283
01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.890
Obviously it was something I'd all I wanted to do,
but like,

1284
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:57.700
oh Jesus Christ.
You know what I mean?
You,
you get,
you get the fucking car.

1285
01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.640
How much fun did you have?
I had a great time.

1286
01:22:00.670 --> 01:22:03.700
Was that not one of the best fucking days you've ever had?

1287
01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.630
It was one of the best days I've ever had.
Yeah,
100% exactly.

1288
01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:12.610
We spent the day together.
Yes.
And I spent all the money.
Right.
I'm sorry.

1289
01:22:12.611 --> 01:22:16.760
I should,
yeah,
there you go.
I would have gotten all dolled up.

1290
01:22:16.761 --> 01:22:19.170
If someone's going to take me for a ride in a corvette convertible,

1291
01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:26.690
I would have what?
A jerk.
All right.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It was for me also.

1292
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:34.130
There's one for you guys.
So that's what you do.

1293
01:22:34.131 --> 01:22:36.950
Next time a girl say you don't take me anywhere.

1294
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:39.260
I'm telling you just go out and rent.

1295
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.730
Rent to fucking why guys need to hear that.

1296
01:22:42.731 --> 01:22:47.210
I'm balancing out the Oprah universe.
Oh,
shut the door.

1297
01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.250
Go fucking watch when he had dumped shows.

1298
01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.780
10 whores in a house.
What are you watching this week?
Huh?

1299
01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:01.600
Fucking 20 chefs try to compete to get the next fryer later job at Tgi Fridays

1300
01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:07.000
and they let themselves get belittled by some fucking chef because he has an

1301
01:23:07.001 --> 01:23:07.810
accent.
Do you know what?

1302
01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:11.380
If we ever have a fucking kid and he wants to be a chef and he goes on that show

1303
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:12.400
and he lets that guy,

1304
01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:17.020
that hell's kitchen guy talk to him that way and not stab them with one of his

1305
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:20.830
good suse,
I will disown him as a son.
I'll disown him as his son.

1306
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:26.380
He comes home and tells me he's gay.
Whatever,
be who you are.
I don't give a shit,

1307
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:29.650
but you do not let somebody fucking scream and yell at you like,

1308
01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.330
Hey fucking believe the way they do that.
I would make a fucking omelet.
Alright,

1309
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:34.810
cheese always holds its heat to,

1310
01:23:34.811 --> 01:23:39.550
and I would just mush it right in the guy's face.
No,
I hate that show.

1311
01:23:39.551 --> 01:23:43.960
That show makes me fucking even angrier than I am.
What do you do?

1312
01:23:43.961 --> 01:23:48.370
And get the fuck out of the kitchen to two inches from their face.

1313
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.950
Ugh.
All right,
get out of here.
Get Out of the Rama,
right?

1314
01:23:53.951 --> 01:23:58.630
You're fucking up the podcast.
This is really going good.
It's going good.

1315
01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:01.030
No.
Then then all of a sudden it becomes like a,

1316
01:24:01.031 --> 01:24:03.920
we're like fucking George Burns in that,
that Brian,

1317
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:07.390
he married that died before him.
You know,
I love about George Burns.

1318
01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:10.990
His wife died before him.
It's a very rare thing,
you know?

1319
01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:14.920
Why did you guys use the outlive us?
It's an inspirational story.

1320
01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.370
Kind of like when you watch that show with that chick who holds up the union

1321
01:24:18.371 --> 01:24:23.050
side number,
Billy Joe McIntyre.
And what is her name?

1322
01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:32.650
What was her name?
Sally field.
All right.

1323
01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:37.030
That's why I said Billy Joel,
but I was talking about the actress.
Oh,

1324
01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:40.150
get out of here.
It's just fucking takes them forever.
Dinner.
Okay.

1325
01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:43.480
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna tell the story about you.
Me leaving today.

1326
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:50.590
We'll then get outta here.
We'll grab your whole bag and get out.

1327
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:55.570
Get Out,
get out of what you're doing.
Yes.

1328
01:24:56.170 --> 01:25:00.010
Could he close the door please?
See that I knew she was going to say no.

1329
01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:03.280
I had to give her one little bit of a victory as she went to leave.

1330
01:25:03.281 --> 01:25:06.940
That's how you do it.
So anyway,
so rent this fucking car right now.

1331
01:25:06.941 --> 01:25:09.130
Those of you are new to my podcast.
Um,

1332
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:15.760
thank you.
Thank you sweetheart.
There's no reason to take the dog.

1333
01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:20.590
Uh,
really that's going to be like,
we get married someday.
We get divorced.

1334
01:25:20.591 --> 01:25:24.220
Is that like an omen calling our Harry kid out of the room.

1335
01:25:26.290 --> 01:25:29.250
All right,
let's plow ahead.
So,
uh,
yeah.
Um,

1336
01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.300
one of the things I always wanted to do,
I've always loved,

1337
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.740
I've always loved cars,
always loved the corvette.
So I just said,
fuck it.

1338
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:39.730
I'm going to rent one costs 350 bucks for a day.
I know it's a lot of money.

1339
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.730
All right,
but I'm telling you,
you,
you're not going to regret it.

1340
01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:46.330
I didn't regret one fucking dime of it.

1341
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.340
It was one of the best days I ever had.

1342
01:25:48.341 --> 01:25:53.050
And he's even as a redhead in the Goddamn desert,
I just put on some sunscreen.

1343
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:58.060
I had a fucking hat.
I know.

1344
01:25:58.061 --> 01:25:59.950
I really just made myself look like a Douche bag.

1345
01:25:59.951 --> 01:26:01.750
Like I hit a big fucking straw hat.
I didn't,

1346
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.860
I had a baseball hat and it was just fun.
It was tremendous.

1347
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.790
I can't even describe it.
Going from a Prius to a Chevy Corvette,

1348
01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.730
it was just fucking awesome.
And,
uh,
and they only gave me 50 miles.

1349
01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.050
This is why he got a lover of recession.

1350
01:26:18.051 --> 01:26:20.060
I bumped it up to a hundred or can you give me a hundred?

1351
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:22.720
And I was about ready to say,
I'll pay you more than the guy goes.
All right,

1352
01:26:22.721 --> 01:26:25.730
I'll give you a hundred.
All right.
And you'd be surprised.

1353
01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:28.250
A hundred a hundred miles is a lot of fucking miles.

1354
01:26:28.251 --> 01:26:30.950
It's a lot more than it seems.
And uh,

1355
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:35.270
but I actually learned something if I ever could afford that God damn car,

1356
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:39.550
I wouldn't get one out here because,
um,

1357
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:41.960
there's just way too many people like during the day,

1358
01:26:41.961 --> 01:26:45.110
the fastest I could get the car going with 85 miles an hour.

1359
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:49.280
And it was absolutely fucking terrifying because there were so many people on

1360
01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:49.641
the road.

1361
01:26:49.641 --> 01:26:54.641
And fortunately I'm a 41 year old guy and I understand ramifications at least at

1362
01:26:55.701 --> 01:26:58.520
that level.
And I'm just like,
this is stupid,
Bill.
You're going to hit somebody,

1363
01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:02.240
you're going to kill him and your whole dreams going to go down the toilet.

1364
01:27:02.241 --> 01:27:07.070
So I fucking slowed down.
But at night that's a different story.

1365
01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:09.680
Night was a different story.
Put the top down.

1366
01:27:09.710 --> 01:27:13.490
I went up to Hollywood hills and I went through Mulholland where it's,
you know,

1367
01:27:13.550 --> 01:27:16.460
you feel like you were on top of the world,
you know,

1368
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:20.900
and I drove like an absolute maniac and scared the shit out of Nia.

1369
01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.520
But she liked it on some level,
just an unbelievable fucking car.

1370
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:30.230
And I don't know why I,
you know,
it's that Catholic fucking upbringing.

1371
01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:34.160
I bust my balls,
I work my ass off and I never get myself anything.

1372
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:38.390
And finally I was like,
fuck this.
So,
um,

1373
01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.050
I dunno.
Long story short,
it was a great thing.

1374
01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.350
It's a great thing to do and uh,
you don't need to get the for,
you know,

1375
01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.850
the Ferrari just to let you know,
the Ferrari and a Lamborghini,

1376
01:27:49.851 --> 01:27:53.360
which you can fucking rent.
It's 1500 bucks for the day.

1377
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:58.220
So
this is what you can do.

1378
01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:02.240
You can get you in 15,
14 of your closest friends.

1379
01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:06.590
Y'all go in in it for a hundred that I would still suck.
Then you only get out,

1380
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:11.591
you get 100 miles divided by 15 Jesus Christ.

1381
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.671
What'd you get?

1382
01:28:13.671 --> 01:28:17.810
Four or five miles each and that would suck as got to be a fucking way to do it.

1383
01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:21.200
It's gotta be a way to do it,
but I mean you get like a Porsche was like 900.

1384
01:28:21.201 --> 01:28:25.010
That's ridiculous.
But the Corvettes,
350 bucks.
Okay.

1385
01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:28.520
You know,
stopped drinking for like a month.

1386
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:32.390
That'll pay for at least half of it if even if you go to a dive bar.

1387
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:37.550
Um,
definitely,
definitely.
That'll,
that's my underrated,

1388
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.770
underrated for this week.
Underrated is,
is,
you know,

1389
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.730
spending some money on yourself for once if you're someone who doesn't do it.

1390
01:28:46.731 --> 01:28:50.150
So I don't know,
this whole podcast went off the fucking rails.
At some point.

1391
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:54.950
Nia came in.
Um,
that really bugged me on set.

1392
01:28:54.951 --> 01:28:59.360
And that was actually,
I was actually for you that some,
some level.
Yeah.

1393
01:28:59.361 --> 01:29:03.000
Obviously it was,
but it was something we did right.
Doesn't that matter?
You know,

1394
01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:04.140
I'm gonna tell the fucking story.

1395
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.410
So we go to the gym this morning and I want to go watch the patriots game.

1396
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.430
Patriots won 59 to nothing,
by the way.
And uh,

1397
01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.290
I dunno,
you know,
I don't want to say I called it,

1398
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.880
but I said Sanchez when they were saying the star is born because he beat the

1399
01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:22.470
titans in the first fucking week.

1400
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.930
I'm not saying that the guy's not going to be a good quarterback,

1401
01:29:24.931 --> 01:29:29.670
but what the fuck is with the New York media with that Skitzo fucking reporting

1402
01:29:29.671 --> 01:29:32.700
that they do?
Sky's the greatest.
Well,
could Duke ever,

1403
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.200
cause he wins one fucking game and then they go through,
you know,

1404
01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:38.960
and then they beat the Patriots when Brady still,
you know,

1405
01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:43.200
plain his first games after a year and a fucking half.
And did they destroy us?

1406
01:29:43.201 --> 01:29:47.910
They won like 13 to fucking seven and dare fucking jet fans.

1407
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:50.280
They're already talking super bowl.
And what happened?

1408
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:55.450
You lost the last fucking three games in a row.
Idiots.

1409
01:29:55.790 --> 01:30:00.330
You had stupid fucking firemen.
They gotta show him every five fucking minutes.

1410
01:30:00.331 --> 01:30:03.180
It's just that I hate people who dress up for football games,

1411
01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:07.980
which means I hate half the people in the Oakland Coliseum.

1412
01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:12.240
Half of them are called.
Half of them look like Ken Stabler the other half.

1413
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:15.930
I know I've talked about this before,
but I just don't understand.
It's like,

1414
01:30:15.931 --> 01:30:18.030
are you remaking the thriller video?

1415
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:20.530
Who Do you think you're intimidating with the,

1416
01:30:20.531 --> 01:30:25.410
you're so fucking plastic spikes coming out of your shoulder pads.
I had just,

1417
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.800
why is my voice cracking shoulder pads

1418
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:34.860
anyways,
so there you go.

1419
01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.900
Things are returning to normal in the AFC east and if you're a giant fan,

1420
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:42.180
a don't sweat that lost today.

1421
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.180
I'm actually actually predicting right now the giants are going to beat the

1422
01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:49.290
saints in the playoffs just because they've been there before and Tom Kauflin is

1423
01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:53.340
a great coach and he's going to use this loss to build on.
At the end of the day,

1424
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:56.850
you got your ass kicked in October.
Who you know who gives a fuck?

1425
01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.240
You're going to be fine.
Eli has that.
I Dunno.

1426
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:03.990
I Dunno to look at his face.
You wouldn't fucking think I told you.

1427
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:07.140
He looks like that kid who comes to school every day and he always has a fucking

1428
01:31:07.141 --> 01:31:07.710
cold.

1429
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:10.830
There's just something about the way the helmet and Matias has cheeks together

1430
01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.550
that he just doesn't look like he's going to get it done.
But I'm,

1431
01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:18.390
I'm telling you,
he just had a bad fucking game.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

1432
01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:22.950
Let's get on with the questions for this week.
Um,
all right,
Bill.
Uh,

1433
01:31:22.951 --> 01:31:26.370
I guess I have to jump right in.
That's kind of a long question here.

1434
01:31:26.371 --> 01:31:27.450
It's actually a story.
Um,

1435
01:31:27.451 --> 01:31:30.750
have there ever been times where you felt that you needed to be funny but the

1436
01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:35.160
situation you were in just left you feeling completely uninspired?

1437
01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:39.360
Like he had some unfunny script to work with or a,

1438
01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:42.690
you're working in some situation where he looked at the material given to you

1439
01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:47.640
and thought,
man,
there is no way I can make this funny.
Uh,
yeah,
definitely.

1440
01:31:47.641 --> 01:31:51.750
Especially with the acting stuff as I'm not established as an actor.

1441
01:31:51.751 --> 01:31:56.130
So I basically take any audition I can.
Um,

1442
01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:58.550
well let me read the rest of us.
Uh,

1443
01:31:58.551 --> 01:32:02.080
I guess what brought the this question about is that I recently graduated

1444
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:06.430
college and I'm attempting to make my way as a professional photographer since

1445
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:10.150
I'm graduating.
It's such a great time.
That's obviously sarcasm.

1446
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:14.530
I have been left with some less than ideal job offers.
I did,
however,

1447
01:32:14.531 --> 01:32:18.630
managed to grab a job working as a photographer and some studio at an upper

1448
01:32:18.631 --> 01:32:23.230
class mall in northern Virginia.
Doe.
I'm happy to have a job.

1449
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:27.100
This new farm position is made me realize that there is an entirely different

1450
01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:32.080
dynamic to being a professional creative person than I originally thought.

1451
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.360
Throughout my experience in photography,

1452
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:38.950
I have always had full control over how things work.
I choose the people,

1453
01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:39.910
the locations,

1454
01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:43.210
how it's going to look and what kind of ideas are going to be conveyed.

1455
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:47.980
But now I'm stuck in a limited studio shooting some of a the most boring people

1456
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:50.500
you've ever seen your life.
Uh,

1457
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:55.530
but basically this guy used to take photos from an artistic standpoint and now

1458
01:32:55.991 --> 01:32:58.850
evidently he's photo taking,
you know,

1459
01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.630
photos of people,
uh,

1460
01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:02.960
<v 7>okay.</v>

1461
01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.940
<v 11>Who I guess are the real life version of the office.
Um,
anyways,</v>

1462
01:33:07.970 --> 01:33:11.570
to get back to his question,
he goes,
I guess I feel that,
uh,
this is a similar,

1463
01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:13.520
this is similar to comedy in that I,

1464
01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:18.350
I have always thought you have to kind of feel a joke when you're saying it.

1465
01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.900
If you thinking about it,
then you probably already fucked it up.
Dude.

1466
01:33:21.901 --> 01:33:25.100
That's a grip.
Brilliant insight.
Yeah,
that's exactly the way it is.

1467
01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:29.660
And there are times a,
yeah,

1468
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:33.410
I didn't even know if I have an audition and,
and,
and the material is horrible.

1469
01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:34.510
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1470
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:37.780
<v 11>What you,
what you do is you call it shine and shit.</v>

1471
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:40.780
You're go in there and you try to make it as funny as you can.
And,
um,

1472
01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:44.620
I always think of Jim Carrey whenever I have a,
uh,
uh,

1473
01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:46.570
if it's like a comedy,
um,

1474
01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:48.560
<v 7>okay.</v>

1475
01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.770
<v 11>If it's a comedy audition and I just think it's really not funny,</v>

1476
01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.200
I usually start to Improv.

1477
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:55.070
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1478
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:56.780
<v 11>And,
uh,</v>

1479
01:33:57.190 --> 01:33:57.490
<v 7>yeah,</v>

1480
01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:59.110
<v 11>I dunno,
I always think of that beginning,</v>

1481
01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:02.080
but I think the most brilliant bit ever,

1482
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.880
one of the most underrated bits ever is the beginning of Ace Ventura part too.

1483
01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:11.440
When he's in that fucking Yak suit or water buffalo,
I dunno what he's in,

1484
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:15.360
but he's filming some people doing some bad shit to animals and just,
yeah.

1485
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:21.070
Basically what happens is all of a sudden the fan or something inside the fake

1486
01:34:21.071 --> 01:34:26.071
Yak breaks and he starts getting so hot because he's in the desert or whatever,

1487
01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:27.640
the fucking Serengeti,

1488
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.660
he starts taking off all of his clothes and it's still hot.

1489
01:34:31.661 --> 01:34:35.440
He's literally butt ass naked and the only way to get out of this fucking Yac is

1490
01:34:35.441 --> 01:34:37.750
to come out the back end.
He literally,

1491
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.400
it looks like this Yak gives birth to a naked adult and the brilliance is

1492
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.000
he comes out the back and he literally falls on the ground the way I've seen a

1493
01:34:49.001 --> 01:34:53.890
baby giraffe fall out of a mother giraffe and he's fucking totally naked.

1494
01:34:53.891 --> 01:34:57.680
It's,
it's one of the most brilliant fucking bits I've ever seen and it gets no

1495
01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.800
respect whatsoever when people talk about comedy and that's one of those things,

1496
01:35:03.261 --> 01:35:08.210
I just look at it and I'm like,
how did that,
how did that come about?

1497
01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:12.890
Was he watching the discovery channel and he saw baby giraffe fall out of the

1498
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:16.670
back of it.
And that got his mind going.
Like,

1499
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:21.170
what if I fucking fell out of the bay?
And I think that's one of those,

1500
01:35:21.171 --> 01:35:24.260
like those are the most brilliant jokes to me where I can't even find the

1501
01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:27.500
beginning point of it.
Um,

1502
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:32.690
so anyways,
I kind of use that guy is as is like an inspiration.

1503
01:35:32.691 --> 01:35:36.410
Like he would totally commit to shit.
There's like legendary stories,

1504
01:35:36.411 --> 01:35:39.470
a headache guy going on auditions wearing his clothes on backwards.

1505
01:35:39.471 --> 01:35:43.550
He did everything,
a lot of fearless stuff.
So,
um,

1506
01:35:43.551 --> 01:35:46.580
if I was you and I was taking pictures of a bunch of boring people and my

1507
01:35:46.581 --> 01:35:50.510
passion in life was to be a photographer,
I would mock the,

1508
01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:55.511
silently mock the situation and I would put these people in ridiculous poses

1509
01:35:56.811 --> 01:36:01.790
that,
um,
they didn't notice were ridiculous.
And,
um,

1510
01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:06.590
I would secretly be keeping an album
for yourself,

1511
01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.130
you know,
and keep some of the worst photos.

1512
01:36:09.131 --> 01:36:13.610
So as you're giving them the photos they want for their regional director of who

1513
01:36:13.611 --> 01:36:17.690
gives a fuck,
you're actually building a coffee book table.

1514
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.420
Um,
coffee book table,
a coffee table book too.
I might do,

1515
01:36:23.421 --> 01:36:28.070
I might fucking just dyslexic without even reading.
What did I say?

1516
01:36:28.071 --> 01:36:29.390
A coffee book table.

1517
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:33.860
A coffee table book your own private one dude.
That would be,

1518
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:39.030
that's what you work on for in the future when you become a famous photographer

1519
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.520
and you need your,

1520
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:44.870
and you're telling your inspirational story of how you got where you're at is

1521
01:36:44.871 --> 01:36:47.290
just start keeping this diary of,

1522
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:52.350
of of horrific photos like photo shoots that she had to go on and you gradually

1523
01:36:54.231 --> 01:36:57.230
basically building a book,
you know.

1524
01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:59.930
So in the end when you have your famous ones of,
you know,

1525
01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.510
taking a picture of some navy guy

1526
01:37:04.530 --> 01:37:07.860
doing shit that you know nowadays would be sexual harassment.

1527
01:37:07.861 --> 01:37:11.670
Just grabbing a woman in jam and your tongue down her throat I guess cause you

1528
01:37:11.671 --> 01:37:14.280
take it in black and white that that makes it art,
whatever.

1529
01:37:14.281 --> 01:37:17.550
When you get that fucking picture and you make a name for yourself,

1530
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:18.920
you'll have all this,
you know,

1531
01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:23.010
kind of like a comedian has like all this hell gig stories and a,

1532
01:37:23.011 --> 01:37:25.230
I just don't know what the rule is with the rights.

1533
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:26.833
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1534
01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:30.950
<v 11>You know,
do you have to,
do the people have to sign off to be like in the book,</v>

1535
01:37:30.951 --> 01:37:34.220
don't you have like some sort of form that you own the rights for all these?

1536
01:37:34.230 --> 01:37:37.610
Are you working for these corporate clients where they own everything?
Fuck that.

1537
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.180
Just make one on the side.
That'll make your friends laugh.

1538
01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:45.140
So as you're taking pictures of these boring,
stupid ass,

1539
01:37:45.141 --> 01:37:46.730
so can people in the back of your head,

1540
01:37:46.731 --> 01:37:49.640
there's a joy when it's awful because you're like,
oh,

1541
01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:51.230
that's going to be a great one.
You know,

1542
01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.010
it's like back in the day when I used to work in a dental office,

1543
01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:58.020
way back in the fucking day as I was,
you know,

1544
01:37:58.021 --> 01:38:02.040
certified to take x rays of people.
They'd say something fucking stupid.

1545
01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:05.040
I would write it on the Little Manila envelope and I would later,

1546
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:08.850
I would try it later on that night.
I used to get such a kick out of that,

1547
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:13.740
that these people had no fucking idea that they were actually writing an act for

1548
01:38:13.741 --> 01:38:16.650
me.
Those are some of the,
my original jokes.

1549
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:21.310
Did I ever tell you the summary?
Original jokes?
They were basically a,

1550
01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.890
what the fuck was a joke?
I used to do

1551
01:38:26.410 --> 01:38:28.310
die and I don't know what the problem is.
I mean,
I,
uh,

1552
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.060
I can't believe I got another cavity.
I mean,

1553
01:38:30.061 --> 01:38:34.890
I have brushed my teeth almost every day and that was such a great setup to my

1554
01:38:34.891 --> 01:38:37.180
punchline,
my crude punchline of,
Oh yeah,

1555
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.630
do you wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit.

1556
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.210
I had some clean ones back then.
I used to work clean.

1557
01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:50.820
One of my big last was a four years of neglect is not cured by a tic tac in the

1558
01:38:50.821 --> 01:38:54.150
waiting room.
Huh?
Isn't that clever?
Isn't that clever?

1559
01:38:54.151 --> 01:38:57.570
That was one of my earlier ones.
So that's what I did.
That's what I did.

1560
01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:02.070
So you're basically working in the dental office right now.

1561
01:39:02.071 --> 01:39:06.390
So what you do is you,
yeah,
he just,
you know,
do this.

1562
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:09.840
Just because you have this job doesn't mean you can't be doing something else on

1563
01:39:09.841 --> 01:39:12.540
the side.
That's what you do.
This is your hustle during the day.

1564
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:15.870
You take pictures of fucking,
you know,
these boring ass people.

1565
01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.280
And then on on the side,
you,
you do your other shit,
you know,

1566
01:39:20.281 --> 01:39:24.210
and then somehow the whole thing fucking comes together.
And next thing you know,

1567
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:27.240
it's Tuesday in the afternoon and you just decide,

1568
01:39:27.241 --> 01:39:30.960
I'm going to run a fucking corvette.
And you go do it.
And life is great,

1569
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:36.210
you know?
All right,
let's go to youtube videos.

It's an adorable kid.
Absolutely adorable kid.

1580
01:40:21.471 --> 01:40:25.160
I think that's it for the podcast this week.
I was a little bit short.
Um,

1581
01:40:25.161 --> 01:40:26.060
I got a little thrown off.

1582
01:40:26.061 --> 01:40:29.630
My girlfriend came fucking walking in and I kind of lost my whole train of

1583
01:40:29.631 --> 01:40:32.720
thought about who's kidding,
who?
I have no fucking game.

1584
01:40:32.721 --> 01:40:34.850
Fine for these God damn things.
I'm exhausted.

1585
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:36.740
I have a bunch of Shit I have to do tomorrow.

1586
01:40:36.741 --> 01:40:41.540
I have to try to get some fucking health insurance as my health insurance ran

1587
01:40:41.541 --> 01:40:46.541
out because I was on the road and I did make the payment and you have 8.2 days

1588
01:40:47.061 --> 01:40:51.680
to make the payment,
so I'm just going to say fuck it.

1589
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:55.100
I'm gonna try and get the best.
Yeah,
they such assholes.

1590
01:40:55.101 --> 01:40:59.150
I already called these fucking people up.
It's such a goddamn racket.
You know,

1591
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.061
like even the evening,

1592
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:03.490
I'm not even bummed out that I lost my health insurance because my health

1593
01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:06.640
insurance basically covered everything except for what the fuck I went in for.

1594
01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:10.030
Right.
So I call up blue cross blue shield and I say,
look,

1595
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:13.390
I just want to be covered for some shit.
I don't give a fuck how much it costs.

1596
01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:19.740
<v 6>I said,
how about some dental?
I just want to be covered for dental cleanings.
Yup.</v>

1597
01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:22.920
All dental cleanings are uh,
are covered.

1598
01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.450
Dental cleanings are our Afri.
He get two free cleanings a year or some shit.

1599
01:41:27.451 --> 01:41:30.240
And I'm like,
fantastic.
That's exactly what the hell I'm looking for.

1600
01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:34.470
So I can go to my dentist and get a free cleaning if I give you all this loot

1601
01:41:34.471 --> 01:41:36.990
every month.
So technically it's not even free.

1602
01:41:37.140 --> 01:41:39.730
Is that what the fuck you're telling me?
Well,
yeah,

1603
01:41:39.731 --> 01:41:43.530
if they're part of the fucking provider fucking cunty fuck,
fuck right.

1604
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:45.270
And I find out they're not.

1605
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:46.623
<v 7>Yes.</v>

1606
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:48.010
<v 6>And basically that they,</v>

1607
01:41:48.190 --> 01:41:52.600
that if they're not part of their list of dentists that I can go to what they,

1608
01:41:52.601 --> 01:41:57.130
basically the money that they give is a $55 for a cleaning.

1609
01:41:57.970 --> 01:41:58.800
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1610
01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.280
<v 11>All right.
I Dunno what state you guys live in,</v>

1611
01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:06.281
but there's no place in Los Angeles that I can get a cleaning for $55 that is

1612
01:42:07.851 --> 01:42:11.450
not in a strip mall and the person speaks fucking broken English.

1613
01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.610
It's such,
it's such a fucking scam.
You know what you're doing.

1614
01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:18.880
You're paying the vague just in case you get hit by a helicopter or some

1615
01:42:18.881 --> 01:42:23.230
bullshit.
But other than that,
it's the biggest fucking scam on the planet.

1616
01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.950
You know,
a buddy of mine told me a long time ago,
you go to the city,

1617
01:42:26.951 --> 01:42:30.000
what are the twos tallest buildings you've always see?
Yeah.
You know,

1618
01:42:30.001 --> 01:42:33.460
if they're owned by banks and they owned by insurance companies and they don't

1619
01:42:33.461 --> 01:42:35.320
get that way by fucking pan people.

1620
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.770
Somebody sent me a great video clip to about the microchips,

1621
01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:40.390
bought them microchipping people.

1622
01:42:40.391 --> 01:42:43.330
For all you guys who think I'm a crazy fucking conspiracy theorist,

1623
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:48.330
just go on the youtube.
Go on the youtube,
go on Youtube and a checkout,

1624
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.050
uh,
just search microchips,

1625
01:42:50.051 --> 01:42:53.140
human beings and look at some of the shit that they have coming out.

1626
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.560
I wish,

1627
01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:59.330
I wish I could find with a fucking link was they showed this creepy commercial

1628
01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:03.160
of all these old people who's a entire,
um,

1629
01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:08.600
medical histories on is on a microchip that's in them.

1630
01:43:08.601 --> 01:43:11.120
And the doctors scans them and you know,

1631
01:43:11.121 --> 01:43:14.780
of course they've fallen down so they can't explain what's wrong with them,

1632
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:18.480
but he just scans him and Oh thank God.
Uh,
they,
they,

1633
01:43:18.481 --> 01:43:21.770
they have a microchip in them so I know exactly what to do for farm.

1634
01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.050
And there's all these people sitting there,
you know,

1635
01:43:24.051 --> 01:43:29.051
given the thumbs up and it's really warm and fuzzy and it's delivered at this

1636
01:43:29.451 --> 01:43:34.190
speech where it causes you to stop thinking.
I'm telling you,
it's,
it's,

1637
01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.140
you feel like they're trying to hypnotize you.

1638
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:38.810
It's all part of the end game people.

1639
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:41.690
This is where I go off the rails and I lose most listeners.

1640
01:43:41.690 --> 01:43:43.640
It's all part of this new world order shit.

1641
01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:45.740
Where are they going to have one world government?

1642
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:50.180
One world fucking bank and everything you ever fucking did is going to be on

1643
01:43:50.181 --> 01:43:52.400
this microchip.
All money,
everything.

1644
01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.960
All you people out there who are accepting direct deposit,
don't fucking do it.

1645
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:00.950
Go down their cash party,
your check,
use cash.

1646
01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.820
Don't get lulled into this.
Oh yeah,
it's easier to use your car.

1647
01:44:04.821 --> 01:44:09.290
I'm telling you that they're funneling the herd right down the shoot.

1648
01:44:09.291 --> 01:44:10.490
They want them to go into,

1649
01:44:10.491 --> 01:44:13.520
and I'm telling you we're all going to be fucking microchipped and then you

1650
01:44:13.521 --> 01:44:15.050
think those guys have is by the balls.

1651
01:44:15.051 --> 01:44:19.100
Now if everybody is microchipped and you can track where everyone is and all

1652
01:44:19.101 --> 01:44:20.780
your money and financial shit,

1653
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:23.750
all your information is on a microchip that is in you.

1654
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.100
The second you fuck with the deal and you start complaining too much,

1655
01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:30.620
all they have to do is turn off your chip

1656
01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:35.900
and you'll instantly be homeless and you you can't revolt anymore and I'm sure

1657
01:44:35.901 --> 01:44:37.130
they'll have degrees of it.

1658
01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:41.540
There'll be the first warning shutoff where they shut off like two thirds of

1659
01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:44.270
your fucking bank account disappears or something like that.

1660
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:49.070
I'm telling you guys that's,
that's way too much fucking power.
I mean,

1661
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:53.020
I don't know how to stop it,
but uh,
uh,

1662
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:56.410
this is just fucking crazy shit.
I really believe that I,

1663
01:44:56.411 --> 01:44:58.910
and I want to get into it.
I just,
I think we're headed

1664
01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:00.630
<v 6>towards some crazy shit.</v>

1665
01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:05.460
I suggest all of you rent a corvette now while you still can get yourself a pit

1666
01:45:05.461 --> 01:45:09.450
bull like me.
Um,
I don't know.

1667
01:45:09.451 --> 01:45:14.430
Get some powdered food and get a gun.
I wish I,

1668
01:45:14.431 --> 01:45:17.250
I wish I grew up with guns.
You know,
I wish he had a fucking gun.

1669
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:20.340
What are you going to do?
You can't fight it.

1670
01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:22.800
You can't fight it because when the shit goes down,

1671
01:45:23.010 --> 01:45:25.950
they're going to sick your own fucking people on you.

1672
01:45:25.951 --> 01:45:28.620
Whatever organization they have.
I don't want to shoot a cop.

1673
01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:29.731
That's what I'm going to do.

1674
01:45:29.731 --> 01:45:32.460
Just some regular guy doing his job and I'll fucking do that.

1675
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.890
<v 7>Okay,</v>

1676
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:36.260
<v 6>well they round you up.
Do I sound fucking crazy?</v>

1677
01:45:36.261 --> 01:45:40.280
I should cause I just made a huge leap right there where I would end up shooting

1678
01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:43.970
a cop.
I didn't explain like 40 other things and that scenario,

1679
01:45:43.971 --> 01:45:46.730
how that ends up going down.
Um,

1680
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:50.780
I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.

1681
01:45:50.781 --> 01:45:53.030
I just know there's a bunch of crazy shit that's going on.

1682
01:45:53.031 --> 01:45:54.350
I don't know how to link it together.

1683
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:57.440
Why do I have to be microchipped in the future?

1684
01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:03.650
Why do they have to know where I'm at at all fucking times and they keep selling

1685
01:46:03.651 --> 01:46:05.780
it to me like they're trying to protect me.
They're not,

1686
01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.730
they're trying to get full fucking control over me and I don't like it the same

1687
01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:11.720
way.
I don't like dead

1688
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:15.660
<v 11>bitch telling me to eat that fucking blew cake.
I don't want you up my ass.</v>

1689
01:46:17.190 --> 01:46:20.640
I'll defend myself.
Thank you very much.
There's enough control right now.

1690
01:46:20.670 --> 01:46:25.200
There is enough control.
That's it.
You already got those awesome planes.

1691
01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:30.390
We can fly to 2000 feet and nobody even knows and they can see if he just shit

1692
01:46:30.391 --> 01:46:33.180
baby.
You guys did you see that on 60 minutes and one of the coolest things ever,

1693
01:46:33.690 --> 01:46:35.730
how they're killing those fucking terrorists over there.

1694
01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.110
They're doing it like right out at like

1695
01:46:39.170 --> 01:46:43.750
what out there and like the Mojave desert or some shit.
I Dunno.

1696
01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:46.470
I think it's cool as hell.
That aspect of it,
you know?

1697
01:46:46.471 --> 01:46:48.930
And as long as this shoot and terrorist,
I have no fucking problem,

1698
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.990
but I don't trust banks as far as you could fucking throw him.

1699
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:55.110
And I think they're dead.
They're just slowly taken over the God damn world.

1700
01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.960
I'm telling you,
people read up on the,
just read up on banks.

1701
01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:01.500
I'm too fucking stupid to explain this to you,

1702
01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:05.850
but read this book the case against the Fed and just really read what the

1703
01:47:05.850 --> 01:47:07.920
Federal Reserve is.
Man.
It's really a frightening fucking thing.

1704
01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:13.700
This is why I want somebody to answer to me.
Where did all the gold go?

1705
01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.890
That's what I want to know.
You know,
back in the day,

1706
01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:17.420
<v 7>okay,</v>

1707
01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.760
<v 11>gold was used his money,
but it was too heavy.</v>

1708
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:23.540
It was inconvenient and it was scary.
It was.
It was.
It was dangerous to carry.

1709
01:47:23.541 --> 01:47:26.120
So the banks called will tell you what,
give us,
give us your gold.

1710
01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:26.970
And when you give the,

1711
01:47:26.970 --> 01:47:30.710
we'll give you these pieces of paper that will represent the gold in anytime you

1712
01:47:30.711 --> 01:47:35.090
want.
You can bring the pieces of paper in the cash and you can get your gold.

1713
01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.730
And at some point they took us off the gold standard,

1714
01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:42.200
but they kept the fucking gold.
They kept a gold,

1715
01:47:42.230 --> 01:47:45.890
they've never been audited and they can't be audited the way they're set up,

1716
01:47:45.891 --> 01:47:47.150
they can never be audited.

1717
01:47:48.230 --> 01:47:51.560
So do you honestly think that that goal is sitting there in Fort Knox?

1718
01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:56.040
I don't think it is.
I really don't.
I don't think it is.
I think it's just fun.

1719
01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:01.080
It's fucking paper and it's the greatest crime in modern history.

1720
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:07.410
They got everybody to come down to the banks and give them

1721
01:48:08.130 --> 01:48:08.650
<v 7>okay,</v>

1722
01:48:08.650 --> 01:48:10.270
<v 11>are fucking life savings.</v>

1723
01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:14.950
And they kept it and in return they gave people pieces of fucking paper.

1724
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:21.790
That's basically what's going on.
And now they can invent more pieces of paper.

1725
01:48:21.791 --> 01:48:25.870
It's just FIDO's fucking ugly.
Why?
How did I get on this?
How did I get into this?

1726
01:48:25.871 --> 01:48:26.950
I don't know how it got into this.

1727
01:48:26.951 --> 01:48:30.190
The fucking leader with the blue KC pissed me off.
Anyways,

1728
01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:33.940
that's the podcast for this week.
Oh,
I know what I forgot to bring up.

1729
01:48:34.570 --> 01:48:37.450
You know something I love,
I'm,
if you're still listening to this right now,

1730
01:48:37.570 --> 01:48:40.720
I love you for listening to this because I know why you're listening to this.

1731
01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:44.890
It's like a train wreck.
It's just fun to just sit here and listen to me.

1732
01:48:44.891 --> 01:48:49.330
Fucking slowly lose my mind and my little compound here.
Um,

1733
01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:53.980
this is the deal.
This week I'm going to be at the DC Improv,
uh,

1734
01:48:54.670 --> 01:48:59.670
the Improv in Washington DC for those of you who are geographically challenged.

1735
01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:03.790
And um,
as of about four days ago,

1736
01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:08.820
all my shows are sold out there and in the business that's called going clean.

1737
01:49:09.250 --> 01:49:13.900
I went clean Thursday,
Friday and Saturday one show,
Thursday two shows,

1738
01:49:13.901 --> 01:49:16.840
Friday two show Saturday,
sold them all out,

1739
01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.850
ridiculous support out there.
So I got a lot of emails of people saying,
you know,

1740
01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.580
if I had half a brain on what a hyped us in the beginning rather than talking

1741
01:49:24.581 --> 01:49:27.220
about this chick with the blue cake.
Um,

1742
01:49:27.221 --> 01:49:30.010
so we added a second show,

1743
01:49:30.250 --> 01:49:35.250
a late show Thursday night and I'm really looking forward to that because what

1744
01:49:35.471 --> 01:49:40.471
kind of a person goes out to the late show to a comedy club on a Thursday night?

1745
01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:42.610
You know what my kind of person,

1746
01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:47.620
okay the kind of person who uh,
maybe he doesn't like job,

1747
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:49.360
you know,

1748
01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.380
or maybe feels that they're not getting paid the way they should be paid and

1749
01:49:53.381 --> 01:49:57.280
maybe they've done enough work for the week.
Thank you very much.
You know

1750
01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:01.020
I wrote a whole list of,

1751
01:50:01.021 --> 01:50:04.950
it came up with 10 reasons why someone would come out to see me on a late show.

1752
01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:08.790
Your boss is one of the three people in America that actually caught the swine

1753
01:50:08.791 --> 01:50:11.300
flu.
So now it doesn't matter what the,

1754
01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:15.180
when you fucking roll in at 11 the next fucking day,
you know,

1755
01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.130
it was that three reasons.

1756
01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.800
Let's see if I can get up to 10 cause you've got to go to 10 for your,
uh,

1757
01:50:21.801 --> 01:50:22.381
your fucking,

1758
01:50:22.381 --> 01:50:27.381
your boss and you got him by the balls so you can go see a late show or your

1759
01:50:27.811 --> 01:50:31.440
boss married and you know who he's fucking and he knows that,
you know,

1760
01:50:32.670 --> 01:50:37.080
so you can Kinda,
you gotta you got a little more freedom.
What is that?
Six?

1761
01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:39.030
<v 4>MMM,</v>

1762
01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.580
<v 11>you're unemployed and a,
you're good at sneaking into comedy clubs.
I know.</v>

1763
01:50:45.581 --> 01:50:47.710
Fucking know.
I'm out.
I'm out of it.
All right.
That's it.

1764
01:50:47.711 --> 01:50:51.010
That's the fucking podcast for this week.
Thank you everybody for listening.

1765
01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:54.700
This one really was a cluster fuck,
but I hope you got something out of it.

1766
01:50:54.701 --> 01:50:57.940
As far as like complaining,
um,
you can't get your money back.

1767
01:50:57.941 --> 01:51:01.540
You just have to say it's unacceptable.
It's unacceptable.

1768
01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:05.650
Just all right.
I've already said this 10 fucking,
I can't get out of this.

1769
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:07.241
You know where it is too.

1770
01:51:07.241 --> 01:51:11.950
As I close the windows and my room here because I curse a lot and it's hot as

1771
01:51:11.951 --> 01:51:16.660
fuck right now.
And I'm literally sitting here sweating like a,

1772
01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:20.170
I feel like I'm in a bunker right now,
you know,

1773
01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.980
and this country's been taken over by the fucking world's been taken over by

1774
01:51:23.981 --> 01:51:27.970
aliens and I'm just leaving this hoping that somebody is going to survive like

1775
01:51:27.971 --> 01:51:32.830
Lee majors in that movie where,
uh,
he drives the race car.
All right.

1776
01:51:32.831 --> 01:51:36.280
That's it.
That's,
that's the less feeble attempt.
I'm going to make it comedy.

1777
01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:40.690
And you getting a good chuckle out of this,
Huh?
Uh,
this,
this is,
you know,

1778
01:51:40.691 --> 01:51:43.540
there's a certain kind of comedy fan out there that just really enjoys train

1779
01:51:43.541 --> 01:51:48.310
wrecks.
So a,
I dedicate the last 47 minutes of this podcast.

1780
01:51:48.311 --> 01:51:51.070
The first two minutes we're good.
Um,
and that's it.

1781
01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:55.320
That's the podcast for this week and now you know why it's free.
Um,

1782
01:51:55.390 --> 01:52:00.100
if you can not make it out to the second show in Washington DC,

1783
01:52:00.610 --> 01:52:04.270
um,
I don't know what to tell you cause I'm sold out for the week,

1784
01:52:04.271 --> 01:52:05.860
but fear not.

1785
01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:09.760
I have other shows I'm going to be at the town hall in New York City.

1786
01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:15.310
That one might also,
that one's coming very close to selling out and uh,

1787
01:52:15.311 --> 01:52:19.150
that's going to be a great night.
It's going to be me,
Paul Versey and uh,

1788
01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:24.220
Joe Derosa.
Um,
New York City.
That's a huge night for me.

1789
01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:29.020
Manhattan,
New York City selling out of fucking theater would be unbelievable.
So,

1790
01:52:29.021 --> 01:52:31.780
uh,
if you get some scratch,
you want to come down to see my new wire,

1791
01:52:31.781 --> 01:52:36.130

After that,
I'll be at the Improv in Tempe,

1792

Arizona on November 19th 20th and the 21st after that,

1793
01:52:42.161 --> 01:52:43.720
we'll be it hilarides in Cleveland,

1794
01:52:43.721 --> 01:52:47.870

01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:08.450
I only send emails when I'm coming to your city.
I don't spam people.

1800
01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:13.430
Occasionally.
If I'm on TV,
maybe I'll send you an email,
but even then it's 50 50.

1801
01:53:13.431 --> 01:53:16.490
But don't feel like if you sign up that I'm just going to be going,
ah,

1802
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.110
I'm not going to Twitter you,
you know,
every five seconds being like,
Oh God,

1803
01:53:21.111 --> 01:53:25.400
I just had a cheese sandwich.
What is up with cheese these days?

1804
01:53:25.401 --> 01:53:29.750
Is it fucking bowl?
I won't do that to you.
Okay.
So please sign up for it.
And,
uh,

1805
01:53:29.751 --> 01:53:33.200
that's it.
Thanks for listening to the podcast.
Thanks for all the questions.

1806
01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:36.710
God bless Ya and do something for yourself this week.

1807
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:40.880
And if you get fucked by corporation,
it's unacceptable.
Remember that?
All right.

1808
01:53:40.881 --> 01:53:41.714
Take it easy.

1809
01:54:05.170 --> 01:54:10.170
