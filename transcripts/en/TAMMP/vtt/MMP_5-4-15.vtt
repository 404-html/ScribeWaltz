00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:01.920
Okay.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 1>Hey,

It's bill burn.</v>

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:08.601
It's the Monday morning podcast for May 3rd,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860

How's it going?
How fucking I uh,

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.470
um,
I'm fucking wiped out.
The tour is over.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.870
The tour is over.
Michael Corleone.

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.900
Godfather part two.
Oh VA.
Um,
the summer wind,

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.430
it came blowing in from a cross that see?

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.890
So I feel like right now because it's over and the lingo adapt to touch your

10
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:44.891
hair and motherfucking walk with me all summer long photo,

11
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.700
we sang a song and then we did some other shared by Dubai.

12
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.960
They're baggy booboo.

13
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.210
Oh freckles is going back to his fucking house

14
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.650

15
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.000
Daddy had to repair Bible,
verbal VT Boob,

16
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.570
those fucking conch,
those contract and con.

17
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.920
Oh Jesus.
I still have one more bill with them.
They,

18
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.690
it goes on and on.

19
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.430
<v 1>So Call Adam Carolla.
He'll kick their ass.</v>

21
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.450
But then you'll look like a SAP on TV buddy buddy too.

22
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.920
Cause you're the Douche bag that had the call Adam Carolla.

23
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:40.580
Cause you're not big enough of a man to tell a contract to go fuck himself.

24
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.153
Um,

25
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.830
<v 0>yeah,</v>

26
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.480
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
Anyways.</v>

27
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.870
<v 1>I'm fucking wiped out.
All right.
I don't know what you want from me this week,</v>

29
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:56.730
but this is the best it's going to get.
All right.

30
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:00.000
This is going to be majors nice and fucking relaxed.
Um,

31
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.340
I am right now,
I am in a,
I don't even know where I am.
I think I'm in Columbia,

32
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:08.610
Indiana.
I know what you're thinking.
Bill.
What the fuck are you doing there?

33
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:12.240
That wasn't on the tour,
that wasn't on your southern tour,

34
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.540
you know,
saw the tour,

Savannah,
Georgia,
Knoxville,
Tennessee,

35
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:22.770
Chattanooga,
Tennessee,
Memphis,
Tennessee,
Sri,
fort,
Louisiana,
New Orleans,

36
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.880

Ms Cfe,

37
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.670
Spend a night in Chattanooga,
Tennessee,
uh,

38
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.620
off the legs and Tin Kentucky over the Evansville,
Indiana.
Um,

39
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.200
there was nothing on there that,

40
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.800
that said that you were going to Columbus,
Indiana.
Well,
I mean,

41
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.180
I ended up here because yesterday I went to the,
uh,
to the Kentucky Derby.

42
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.890
Uh,
me,
Paul Versey,
Jason Law head,
and his dad,

43
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.190
the hall of Fame Basketball Coach Jim law had,
we all went to the game,

44
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.670
the game.
We went to the Derby man.
What a fucking great time.
I,

45
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.671
I'm highly suggest going that dressing like a jackass.

46
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.970
Like everybody does.
Big stupid hats.
Bow ties.
The women there.

47
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.060
Good Lord.
Uh,
there's some fucking Philly

48
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.610
beautiful women,
beautiful women.
I'll tell you it deaf.

49
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.420
They the fucking women.
They'll fucking
dude,

50
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.410
they were crushing it right up until the early fifties of talent.

51
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.730
Some fucking decades.

52
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.340
Decades of fucking Derby Williams.

53
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.290
Winter's walking around the fucking the,
uh,
the grand stand area.

54
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.213
Um,

55
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.780
we had great seats and a right a little bit past the finish line.

56
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:50.140
We just had the best time,
you know,
it was fucked up was that they sold them,

57
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.420
but I don't even know how to get into this man.
They,

58
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.460
they was selling like standing room only seats are right.

59
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.270
So we paid through the fucking knows to sit in a box,
right?

60
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.940
Like we donate it to a presidential campaign.

61
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:06.400
We were sitting right at the God damn finish line a little past it,

62
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.500
a little past whatever.
Don't break my balls.
Come on.

63
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.320
You can see the horses we were,
we were at.

64
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.810
You could actually see them start of the race ran right by us.

65
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.090
Then they went around the first turn and then they kind of disappeared behind a

66
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.120
some of these corporate tents in the sea of fucking sunburn humanity that was

67
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:26.920
standing just standing on the inside grass,

68
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:31.380
which I don't know why you would do that.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
why?

69
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:36.070
Why wouldn't you stay at home and just watch it on TV and not sit there like a

70
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:40.840
bunch of fucking refugees in a tent city that had no tent for you?
You know,

71
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.520
you might as well have watched that.

72
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.660
Watch a police horse gallop by after a crack crackhead underneath the fucking

73
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.460
overpass as far as I'm concerned.
All right.
In fields,

74
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:55.420
seats are for fucking animals.
All right?
Unless you're young,

75
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:59.470
you don't have any fucking money.
All right?
You have a television.

76
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.360
It's on TV for fucking free.
Why are you going to stand there?

77
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.350
Although I would do it,
I do it a NASCAR race.
I do that in a second.

78
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.750
I'd be on the infield because you know,
first of all,

79
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:16.630
what I like about being on the Infield,
it's the fucking inertia.

80
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.500
When those fucking cars wipe out usually takes them to the outside wall.

81
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.250
And I know sometimes the bang off the outside wall and they go to the inside,

82
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.250
but at least they hit the wall and they're starting to slow down.

83
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.770
You know what I mean?
And you know,

84
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.980
every once in a while a tire flies off and somebody loses a head of two.

85
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:37.981
But that's the price you pay for getting to sit on your fucking cooler in the

86
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.540
middle of the goddamn track.

87
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.500
I actually had one of the best times I ever had and went to the Indy 500 and

88
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.400
like 1995 and most of you were like eight years old.
And uh,

89
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:50.350
we sat on the inside of one of the turns,

90
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.280
brought in this giant fucking cooler and me and my two buddies just got

91
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.420
obliterated.
You know,
watching the fucking go to the buy.
It's hilarious.

92
00:05:58.421 --> 00:06:00.860
You don't see anything,
you just sit in the inside turns and you just hear,
Oh,

93
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.610
<v 2>Ooh,</v>

94
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.660
<v 1>oh my voice is fucked up.</v>

95
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.960
Well,
I tell you what,
here,
you just see him go by,
right?

96
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.750
And every once in a while somebody would hit the wall in front of you.
Like,

97
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:20.070
oh my God,
was she an accident?

98
00:06:20.071 --> 00:06:22.230
But you forgot they're going like 200 something miles an hour.

99
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.150
So they hit the wall in front of you and then just go.

100
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.680
They just go flying down the fucking track.
So you don't really see it.

101
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.950
You see him hit the wall and then they continue like another quarter mile in

102
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:36.650
about two seconds.
But uh,
it is amazing.
But anyway,
so we got there and uh,

103
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.610
they was selling standing room tickets.
I get it.
People want to stand up,

104
00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:43.320
you know,
get in there to watch the fucking thing.

105
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.540
So there's the level we're sitting and then there's this giant,
like,
you know,

106
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.560
uh,
walkway.
And then there's the next section.

107
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.890
All right.
And,

108
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.150
and so basically the people should have stood in that middle section where

109
00:06:57.151 --> 00:07:00.930
you're walking to either make a left to go to the higher seats or make a right

110
00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:02.790
to go down where we were at and where we were at,

111
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.590
there was two sections and there was like a,
uh,
in a little skinny hallway.

112
00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:10.950
So these fucking assholes,
we're walking down and they was standing up there,

113
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.490
right.
And,
uh,

114
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.340
you know,
all they had was his volunteer teenage kids,
you know,

115
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.410
sitting there chewing gum,
not stopping him.

116
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.850
So it got to the point after a couple of races and who's kidding who a couple of

117
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:30.600
fucking mint juleps that people start going,
what the fuck?
But everybody's,

118
00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:33.960
there is plot in automating still Kentucky.
Hi,
y'all doing,

119
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.600
I fucking hate your guts,
but I'm going to smile on your face.

120
00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:40.290
You know what I'm saying?
Afterwards,
you know,
I'll fucking,

121
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:45.180
I'll stick a fucking sounds sorta farming tool and the back of your goddamn
neck,

122
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.520
but right now I'm going to hire you out.
They're like,
oh,
that's great.

123
00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:51.180
Where are you from?
Well,
y'all from now.
I didn't get that experience in Kentucky.

124
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:52.380
They were cool as shit,
but whatever.

125
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.580
So finally we ended up saying something,

126
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.650
you know,
well,

127
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:03.760
I heads dad fucking taps this guy in the shoulder and he's like,
excuse me sir,

128
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.040
you know we paid to sit here.
You guys are standing up here.

129
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.061
I don't know what happened.

130
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:11.740
All I know is it started getting heated and I saw what Jay Jay got his fire
from.

131
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.210
So now you know law I hadn't version right there.
So I got to step in.
Granted,

132
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.510
this is the funny thing.
I got to step and dress like fucking Colonel Sanders,

133
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.290
right?
Or at the very least that I played banjo and a dixieland band.

134
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.590
I got on a fucking bow tie with the Goddamn,
you know,

135
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.450
my dad owned a plantation hat and I come in,
you know,
I didn't even come in.

136
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.240
I never got out of my seat.
I just start John at this guy.

137
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.470
I yelled,
I got buddy,

138
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.340
I paid to sit in this seat and I'm staring at the back of your head.

139
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.640
So he looks at me,
he goes,
what'd you say?
I said,

140
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:48.240
I paid to sit in this seat and I'm staring at the back of their head,
your head.

141
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.930
And he goes,
Oh yeah,
who do you look to view?
I go,
I don't like it.

142
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.510
That's why we're having this conversation.
Right.

143
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.830
And quickly I realized that he wasn't gonna throw a punch and a punch of the

144
00:08:57.831 --> 00:08:59.360
dirt and I'm not going to throw a punch,
right?

145
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.960
I'm not gonna I'm just gonna fucking punched.

146
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.370
It's like a street hockey game and like fucking seventh grade.
Right.

147
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.060
So with John back and forths,
right.
And His fucking,

148
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.490
you know is broad saying something that I don't listen to her.

149
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.910
I can't hear that voice.
It's too fucking high up in the strategy.

150
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.380
Hey shut up lady.
So I said,
hey.
He goes,

151
00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:21.320
what are you getting involved fucker?
Cause you're yelling at a 77 year old.

152
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.290
I said,
80 year old man.
I rounded up though.
Yell at an 80 year old man.
He goes,

153
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.380
well I wasn't yelling at him.
You're old man.
I go,
really?

154
00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:32.210
That wasn't you that look like you two seconds ago doing that,
you know,
whatever.

155
00:09:32.211 --> 00:09:36.440
And then the fucker woman,
you know,
he was,
you know,

156
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.970
that 80 oh man verbally attacked him.
Every fucking Douche,
you know,

157
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.600
verbally attacked him.
He's fucking 80.
What's he gonna do?
You know what I mean?

158
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.960
Although you've got to watch out for an 80 year old,
you know,

159
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.450
the very least maybe fought in Korea.
He could,
you know,
hand to hand combat.

160
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:54.330
You don't know what flashback could come back.
Next thing you know,
all right,

161
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:58.350
he's using his fucking racing form is a band that you could have some problems.

162
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.550
So of course me,
you know,

163
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.910
everybody's dressed all dapper and everything that I feel like a fucking asshole

164
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.650
afterwards,
everything's settled down in this,
this guy who,

165
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.180
who wasn't involved in the fight but was also standing up with his fucking

166
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:15.360
girlfriend and he had his hand,
not on our ass,
like under it.

167
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.610
And she kept moving it like,
can you stop?

168
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:21.270
Like tap on the back of my pussy with the middle of your finger,
please.

169
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.920
Um,
he actually looks over at me and he goes,
hey bill,
big fan.

170
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.220
It felt like such an asshole.
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

171
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.630
I'm not just this fucking asshole anymore yelling at the game.
They're like,

172
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.670
oh yeah,
Bill Burr was a fucking asshole.

173
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.310
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

174
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.370
<v 1>Ah,
it's fucking hilarious.
So then I felt all self conscious,</v>

175
00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:48.520
like is it going to end up on Youtube?
And that,

176
00:10:48.521 --> 00:10:52.210
that I gave a shit about what I said it was that I was dressed like a fucking,

177
00:10:52.211 --> 00:10:55.900
you know,
like I had a chicken franchise.
That's the thing I was worried about.

178
00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.170
So anyways,
so that happens but a,

179
00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:04.171
so basically we kind of did that and we kind of scared a lot of people away and

180
00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:07.870
uh,
then I was Kinda,
you know,
afterwards sobering up,
you know,

181
00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:08.681
cause I was still like,
you know,

182
00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:13.510
I got to stay sober cause I got to watch game seven of the clippers and the

183
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:18.220
spurs and then I got to watch the pack.
Manny Pacquiao fight,
right.
Uh,

184
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.790
Mayweather Pacquiao fight,
right.
So anyways,
um,

185
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.900
I'm starting to sober up and I just started thinking like,
Oh man,
you know,

186
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.030
I shouldn't have fucking done that.

187
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:32.350
We both share to handle that situation better.
They should have been some,

188
00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:36.130
excuse me if you don't mind,
and shit like that.
And I was thinking about it.

189
00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:39.710
And then somebody finally did was just talking to me about the Derby.
Uh,

190
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.710
this lady,
she goes,
who's kidding,
who?

191
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:43.630
This is just a really well dressed shit show.

192
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.310
And I laughed because I was kind of sitting there fighting the feeling that is

193
00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:52.120
fancy as this was as legendary as all this is,
this event.

194
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.820
At the end the day you're just kind of going to the track,
you know what I mean?

195
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.170
This is really,
we're just betting on the dogs,
whatever their horses,
you know.

196
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.840
But anyways,
um,
so what have we start betting races and of course I'm losing,

197
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.560
I'm losing the fucking track has been open for over 140 fucking years.

198
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.650
Hundred 41 runnings of that race.
Okay.

199
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.610
You don't stay open by fucking paying out people.
So,
you know,
I'm losing it.

200
00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:22.530
I'm losing and uh,
I find just ass.
Fuck it.
I'll just bet on the derby race,

201
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.550
a lot of people don't know this.

202
00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:27.810
The races start at 10 30 and they run them on the dirt track and there's a grass

203
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.350
track,
a little short track.
Um,
they just,
you know,

204
00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:34.320
they'll run like six horses and a if you front,

205
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.030
it was funny as if you're on the other side of the track,

206
00:12:36.031 --> 00:12:38.640
you can't even see the goddamn race.
You just got to watch it on TV,

207
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.330
which once again is sitting there fucking getting sunburn.
Right.

208
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.730
Like it came to this country in a raft 20 minutes ago hoping to get your fucking

209
00:12:46.731 --> 00:12:51.720
Schumann writes,
Tony Montana reference.
Um,
so anyways,

210
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.100
well,
you know,
I just let all those ones go and um,
I want,

211
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.400
I bet the Derby race and uh,
I,
I just picked three favorites just trying to,

212
00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:01.770
when somebody picks three favorites,
bet them across the board,

213
00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:05.670
two of them came in.
Um,
and I think I will,
what did I do?

214
00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:07.830
I think I lost like 25 bucks on the day.

215
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.200
I was down like 50 or 60 bucks and then the end I won like 30 something.
Yeah,

216
00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:15.390
something like that.
But whatever.
It was a fucking awesome time.

217
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.610
I would definitely do it again.
I would say if you go to the Derby race,
uh,

218
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.890
that's actually,
that's a great thing to bring your fucking lady too,

219
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.020
because it's a sporting event.
You get to gamble,
right?
Your dress up.

220
00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:30.420
She dresses up.
They liked dressing up,
right?
They look,

221
00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:34.220
they liked the fucking horses.
Right?
Who doesn't like animals?
You know,

222
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.120
doesn't like animals.
Fucking animals.
Animals don't like animals,

223
00:13:39.121 --> 00:13:43.800
right?
They don't self-loathing how much,
you know,
they're always talking about,

224
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.730
you know,
how,

225
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.580
what fucking animals that human beings act like.
What about the animals?

226
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.980
The reference,
you know?

227
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:54.850
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

228
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.950
<v 1>You don't goes on in those woods,
in those jungles.</v>

229
00:13:56.951 --> 00:13:59.800
You know what goes on murder every fucking day.

230
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.010
Every God damn day throughout their fucking murdering people.

231
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:06.610
That's how they get their food.
You know,
if they murder one another,

232
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.370
I mean,
my,
my actually presenting the southern argument,

233
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.770
basically a supporting hunting.
Alright,
tell you what man,

234
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:20.970
if we didn't shoot him,
they just fucking eat each other.
So what support,
oh,

235
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:23.010
hungry too,
motherfucker.
What am I supposed to do?

236
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.420
Eight you might suppose to a you,
um,
oh,

237
00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:31.680
one of the great heckles I ever got.
I owe so many apology in Evansville,

238
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.730
Indiana.
Um,

239
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.550
the fun thing about when people text during your show is like,

240
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.110
they know I always have the,
the crowd,

241
00:14:40.111 --> 00:14:41.760
like I can see the first few rows or whatever,

242
00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:43.170
but then it just kind of goes black.

243
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:47.010
So if somebody starts texting their whole face lights up when they're up there

244
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:47.641
so you can see it.

245
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:50.970
So I always freak people out of being in the middle of my act and I'll just see

246
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.810
light like 40 rows up and I'll just point right at him and I go texting,

247
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.760
you know,

248
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.030
and I do this little rift about the person dying a thumb cancer cause they can't

249
00:15:00.031 --> 00:15:04.680
put the phone down.
Right.
So,
uh,
so whatever,

250
00:15:04.681 --> 00:15:07.230
I'm in the middle of my show in Evansville and having a great fucking time.

251
00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:11.940
It's the last night at the tour.
Uh,
you know,
we're going to go fuck,

252
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.980
I still have explain why I'm in Columbus,
Indiana.
Um,

253
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.410
I'll explain that a little bit,
right?

254
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.760
So I'm going to get wine in it down and get towards the end of my act and this

255
00:15:20.761 --> 00:15:25.760
person's,
I see this person's face light up,
40 fucking rose up and I go texting,

256
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.580
can I start doing my little riff about thump cancer?
And um,

257
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.730
the guy ends up going,

258
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.870
yells out here after I finished it,

259
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.700
my whole long soliloquy about this person texting,
right?
And he goes,
uh,

260
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.750
he just yells out,
I was taking your picture.
You fucking Dick.

261
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.270
Oh my God.
Tagging your she fucking deck.

262
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.650
And uh,
I forget what I said to him,
but I was wrong.
It's like,
oh,
are you just,

263
00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:05.210
and I go,
well,
you're not supposed to.
I'm going to hang out after the show.

264
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:08.390
You could do it.
Then I kind of where my way out of instead of being like,
oh,

265
00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:11.480
you know what sir,
I was wrong.
I thought you were texting.

266
00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:13.160
You were actually taking my picture of meaning.

267
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:16.490
You obviously we're having a good time with the show.
I was in the wrong,

268
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.850
I owe you an apology.
I'm sorry.
Instead I just said,
well,
you know,

269
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:23.990
you're not supposed to.
And that was like two,
two days ago.

270
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:29.060
And I just keep thinking in that,
that's been making me laugh for two days.

271
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.240
You know,
like when somebody just says something that just strikes you as funny,

272
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.170
like for two days it just keeps popping in your head,
you know what I mean?

273
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.410
And people think you're weird because you just burst out laughing out of
nowhere.

274
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:43.140
I've been doing that for two days.
I just went over to a waffle house.

275
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.670
I'm on the road,
cut me some slack,
right?

276
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:48.290
And I fucking go over there and in the middle I'm of sitting at the counter,

277
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.641
you know,

278
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:54.230
it's like elbow to elbow cause it's a Sunday here when I'm recording this,
um,

279
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.800
and I'm sitting next to this fucking guy and I to know where I,
you know,

280
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.550
I ain't know what I was doing.
I think I already ordered my stupid dinner,

281
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.740
my breakfast and night that's just heard this guys voice taking your picture.

282
00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:07.670
You fucking Dick.
I just burst out laughing.

283
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.940
I kind of weirded out the guy next to me like why is this guy laughing?

284
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:14.500
Is he laughing at me as if fault can problem meal.
What?
Um,

285
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.170
so I apologize to that guy.
You were right.
I was wrong.

286
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:21.740
And then also I want to thank you for probably,
you know,

287
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.200
I don't think you're sitting around still laughing at my act.

288
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.320
You've making me laugh for 48 hours.

289
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.700
I'm sure you weren't laughing at my act after I trashed you for texting.

290
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:36.410
You took,
took it really personally.
Take your picture.
You fucking Dick.

291
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.360
Um,
that was great.
Don't do that in Alabama.

292
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.650
Don't say that in Alabama.
Pegging your Peci fucking deck.

293
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.880
And then my other favorite one was,
uh,
was in mobile.

294
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.420
I was doing some bit about something dumb that I did.
I said,

295
00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:54.254
you can't believe that.

296
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.370
Why the fuck would I do that and hear this guy go fucking dumb ass.

297
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.370
Needless to say,
oh,
freckles had a great time.
Um,

298
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.720
I didn't even talk about Louisville,
Kentucky,
man.
We had,

299
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.400
oh shit.
So glad I didn't forget.
Oh,
let me,
let me do the Columbus thing.

300
00:18:14.401 --> 00:18:17.130
Fucking add kicking in here.
Um,

301
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.470
how I ended up in Columbus,

302
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:24.150
Indiana is basically because all the hotels anywhere near Louisville are sold

303
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:26.490
out.
Um,
and we laid,
I mean,

304
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.980
I got the tickets and I waited till the last second to get a fucking room.

305
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:33.960
So we had like a 75 mile round trip drive and uh,

306
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.220
you know,
we all kicked in for a car service,
you know,

307
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.330
it wasn't that bad at the end of the day.
And,
uh,
it was great.

308
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:43.350
Door to door service so we could get all Likud.
Um,

309
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.650
so anyways,
uh,
one of the coolest things ever.
Okay.
So we're going to Lexington,

310
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:53.550
Kentucky,
and as I mentioned,
slashed,

311
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.750
threatened that I was possibly considering when I was in Lexington,

312
00:18:57.751 --> 00:19:01.530
Kentucky wearing my Kentucky Derby outfit on stage.

313
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.330
And uh,

314
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.430
which was basically a seersucker suit with a pink and baby blue bow tie with

315
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.130
silly Canadiens fan fucking socks to match.

316
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.830
I owe the apology to the ABS fan too.

317
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.060
I liked silly sox who knew a Bruins fed,
I got to admit,

318
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:25.630
silly sucks.
Have Fun.
And you know who likes some,
the fucking lady.

319
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.360
<v 4>Um,
oh,
look at those.
Those are cute.</v>

320
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.960
<v 1>Had I known back when I was a single man,
I'll tell you right now,</v>

321
00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:35.870
if you're in a dry spell right now and you're not fucking getting pussy,

322
00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:37.790
I'm telling you,
sorry to be graphic ladies.

323
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.350
Fucking go get yourself some silly socks and just stick your foot on something

324
00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:44.870
that's a little higher than your other foot and you'll show it off and they'll

325
00:19:44.871 --> 00:19:47.690
come walking up to you.
They'll strike it up.

326
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.620
Women cannot resist a fashion statement.

327
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.350
I'm telling you,
there's something about,
not all of them,

328
00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:55.790
but I'm sounding to something about it now.

329
00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:58.910
I understand those Frenchies and why they had those fucking menage a trois was,

330
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.050
it's not cause they're,
they're more schooled in the language of love.

331
00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:07.610
It's cells fucking sucks,
which is smart,
right?
You get,

332
00:20:07.611 --> 00:20:10.160
I'm looking down at your ankles because you don't have deodorant,
you know,

333
00:20:10.161 --> 00:20:10.994
fucking up.

334
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.010
Ah,
Jesus built what is wrong with you?
Oh fuck you.

335
00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:22.690
You fill an hour every fucking week
anyways.
Oh,
okay.

336
00:20:22.691 --> 00:20:27.460
I'll tell you the Lexington,
uh,
story,
uh,
right after these messages here,

337
00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:30.190
and I don't have my advertising yet so much to drop these.

338
00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:32.830
And so if it sounds different,
that's why.

339
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:37.450
So let's take a moment right now to listen to bill burr in the future.

340
00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:41.650
Struggle his way through the copy of some advertising for this week.

You don't have to be a fucking idiot to keep over paying.

418
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.040
I'm a semi known person and I'm constantly getting my picture taken by some

419
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:59.720
fucking animal outside of a bar and I'm on TV shows and high definition.

432
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.770
and I'm back.

433
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.150
I'm back and it's fucking yesterday or maybe earlier today,

434
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.860
depending on whenever I get to fucking advertising.
Um,
anyways,
let's get back to,

435
00:26:58.861 --> 00:26:59.820
uh,
oh,

436
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:02.850
this is a good way for me to not to fucking get off track here is to not read

437
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:05.520
advertising.
Just plow through this shit.
Um,

438
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:08.640
so I'll actually come back out of the advertising and give you the Lexington

439
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:12.330
story.
So he goes,
so I'm sitting there,

440
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:16.620
I'm getting ready for the show and I'm ironing my regular shirt and everything

441
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:20.070
and I'm thinking I should wear the Kentucky Derby outfit.
Then it took,
you know,

442
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.570
we'll do know like it,

443
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.730
it looks stupid and it was just like,
yeah,
don't be a pussy.

444
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:31.560
Put the fucking thing on.
So I put the whole thing on right.

445
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.150
And I'm standing backstage and I'm waiting to go on.
Um,

446
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.030
after versing law had killed it,
law heads hosting.

447
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:43.410
So he's about ready to bring me up.
And for the first time since I can remember,

448
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:47.790
I was actually a little nervous just walking out to do a regular show,
you know,

449
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.690
um,
you know,
if it's a fucking special or something like that,

450
00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:56.520
you always get the butterflies.
Um,
and I was actually nervous,
so he introduced,

451
00:27:56.521 --> 00:27:57.600
please welcome bill burrs.

452
00:27:57.601 --> 00:28:01.950
So I come walking out and everybody's clapping and as they're clapping,

453
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.480
they're taking in what the fuck I'm wearing.
Right.

454
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.730
And uh,
they went fucking nuts.
They all stood up.

455
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.130
It was one I got to tell you,
I got to thank people like to think that it's,

456
00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.840
that's the coolest round of applause I ever gotten my life.

457
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:22.710
I've never heard a crowd cheer like that.
It was a different thing.
It wasn't,

458
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:26.530
that was funny or I relate to that.
That was a,

459
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.240
I can't explain it like it was,
it was,

460
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.950
it made the fucking tour really made the tour.
And then it was funny.

461
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:35.970
Now I'm standing there,

462
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.210
I got this outfit on and then it dies down and I go into my act.

463
00:28:39.211 --> 00:28:41.940
And that just became even funnier.
Like,
oh,
he's just going to do is act,

464
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:46.230
dress like,
like he saw competing with Popeye's chicken here.

465
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:47.580
And um,

466
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.570
I toughed it out for a good 10 minutes before I finally had to take the hat off.

467
00:28:51.571 --> 00:28:52.800
I'm like,
you guys,
I got to tell you this,

468
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:54.900
this seemed like a great idea in 90 seconds ago,

469
00:28:54.901 --> 00:28:56.850
but this fucking thing is hot as hell under these lights.

470
00:28:56.851 --> 00:29:01.280
So I ended up taking off the hat.
But,
uh,
anyways,
we,
um,

471
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.070
we ended up hanging out in Lexington,
Kentucky and it was,
uh,

472
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.150
it was just ridiculously polite people.

473
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.320
We were riding on the campus of the Kentucky wildcats and um,

474
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.560
I mean it wasn't just me even a law ahead Versie we're both just really blown

475
00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:24.390
away at how great the people were in Kentucky.
You know,

476
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.070
I'm just really,
really just nice,
polite,
smart people.

477
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:32.430
We were right there on the fucking campus or whatever.
What are you shy?

478
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.720
We weren't smart and intelligent.
You fucking Dick in Evansville.

479
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.240
I'm just saying,
you know,
it was a different vibe.

480
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.850
Each one had a different vibe like I liked and everyone was shitting on

481
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:47.230
Evansville saying what a shit hole it was.
And uh,
I dunno,

482
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.560
I just have a different perspective living in a state that is running out of

483
00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:52.450
water,
you know,

484
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:56.050
that is overly populated living in a city that's actually a desert for for some

485
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:59.320
reason it doesn't look like it cause we steal the water and everybody freaking

486
00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:00.790
the fuck out.
Like captain Kirk,

487
00:30:00.791 --> 00:30:04.340
they're actually having the balls to say that Seattle has too much water and

488
00:30:04.341 --> 00:30:07.900
it's like,
Oh really?
Oh did nature fucked that up?

489
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.230
Did God put the water in the wrong place?

490
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:16.210
Shat knee Om Shanti Om Bill Jetty.

491
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:21.580
Oh Billy Shat.
Um,
it's like no,
we've been stealing the water.

492
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:25.360
At some point the check was going to hit the table.
Right.
It's time to pay up.

493
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.410
Who knows what's going to happen.

494
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.560
Do you realize I just fucking put it in one of the great bathrooms of all time

495
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.380
in Los Angeles and it might not have a drop coming out of the spicket.

496
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.100
Whose fault is that?
I knew it was a desert.
You know,

497
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.710
you got to know when to hold them,
know when not to build a bathroom.

498
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.830
Especially when you live in a desert debt,
steal some water.

499
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.810
Don't act like a victim even though you're a captain of a spaceship.

500
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.860
That was long fucking time ago and that space ship wasn't real.

501
00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.970
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
um,

502
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.930
so,
so we go to the Derby.
The derby ends.
Now we're driving back,

503
00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.210
you know,
everybody's starting to nod off or whatever and uh,

504
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.160
we fucking get back here to Columbia,

505
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:16.400
Indiana and we're all excited because we're going to go watch the,
uh,

506
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.810
Mayweather Pacquiao fight that we're gonna Watch game seven and then went to me

507
00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.400
where the package,
Oh fuck.
Oh by the way,
I was wrong about the,
uh,

508
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.630
my Redwings pick.

509
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.350
Congratulations to the Tampa Bay lightening for closing out that series.

510
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:34.890
And then I also said that the spurs were going to beat the clippers.

511
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:37.990
I said the spurs once the clippers lost game two,
I was like,

512
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:40.910
that fucking series is over.
It's the clippers.
They don't have an enemy.

513
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.760
The spurs know how to win.

514
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.830
It's the first round they're going to fucking get past some shows.

515
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.410
You what the fuck?
I know.
Once again,
it shows you what the fuck I know.

516
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.690
Which also begs the question,
why the fuck you still listening to this?
Um,

517
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.780
we ended up going into,
uh,
the buffalo wild wings up the street.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

518
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.390
The buffalo wild wings.
And uh,

519
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.840
it turns out they don't have to fight with like,

520
00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:06.130
what do you mean you don't have the fight?

521
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.240
It's the biggest fucking fight in the last 10 goddamn years in boxing.

522
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.310
How do you not have to fight
Mr Wilde links?

523
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:20.350
Can I call you a buffalo?
A Buffy?
Why don't you have the fucking fight,
right.

524
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:21.880
Well,

525
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.090
we walk in there and within two seconds we realize why they don't have the fight

526
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:29.410
because it's an absolute shit show.
We walked into that fucking place,

527
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.350
the buffalo wild wings.
Um,

528
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.200
and they had game seven up on the big screen.

529
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.130
They had two big screens set up on the big screen.

530
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:45.131
They have game seven of the spurs and the clippers and next to it they have

531
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:49.550
another big screen.
And on that they have some replay of a golf tournament.

532
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.580
And for whatever fucking reason,
when we walked in,

533
00:32:52.581 --> 00:32:57.581
the volume was up on the golf tournament to like spinal tap 11 I've never heard

534
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:03.650
golf commentary that loud in my life.
And meanwhile the Spurs,

535
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:04.850
it was already the third quarter.

536
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:07.430
It was just to start coming out of this coming out of the half.

537
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.100
It was like 54 52 some crazy like that.
So I guess it was,
you know,
you know,

538
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.140
quarter in mid,
mid third quarter,
right.

539
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:20.450
And was sitting there while I had immediately beside himself,

540
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.640
led,
used to manage a fucking restaurant.

541
00:33:22.641 --> 00:33:24.650
So we always walked in and we get them going.
We go,
Jay,

542
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:27.380
could you manage this verse?
He always says,
Hey Jay,
could you manage this place?

543
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.420
And he goes like,
you came here to get right and I'll tell you right now,

544
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:32.090
she'd be fired.
And he just starts firing half the staff.

545
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:35.900
It's just this fucking running joke.
And we asked them about this place.
She said,

546
00:33:35.901 --> 00:33:38.620
well,
how would you manage this place?
He said,
I boarded up and shut it down.

547
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.050
Called the fucking regional manager and say,
we got to start over again.

548
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.910
So we say to the waitress,
uh,

549
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.300
can we put the a game seven basketball fan on or are these you guys really into

550
00:33:54.081 --> 00:33:55.640
golf here?
And she kind of laughs in.
Yeah,

551
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:57.290
I don't know why the volumes up on that either.

552
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.760
So they switch it over to the game
and we were watching the game.

553
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.690
It's still beside ourselves that a buffalo wild wings for as much as you watch

554
00:34:05.691 --> 00:34:08.600
their commercials,
like this is the place to go to watch the game.

555
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.470
Everybody with their tall fucking slender hoary looking glasses,

556
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.350
drinking the blue moon with the orange in it,
right?

557
00:34:15.351 --> 00:34:19.940
Having the best fucking time ever watching the game tell a little petty lies to

558
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:22.850
their friends and their wives and all this shit because it's so great.

559
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:26.330
Isn't that also the one where you get to hit pause so you can just make this

560
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:31.160
amazing experience continue even longer?
I'll tell you right now,

561
00:34:31.161 --> 00:34:34.550
man,
our experience at the buffalo wild wings,
Applebee's could talk shit.

562
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.380
The buffalo wild wings.
And you know,

563
00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:37.910
when you go to an Applebee's to watch a game,

564
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:40.790
you watch that on a square kitchen TV.
All right?

565
00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.940
That's stuck up next to some fake brick,
you know,

566
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:45.860
as they bring you in with one of those hot skillet,

567
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:51.270
that's some shit that they think is fancy.
All right.
I was poor people.
No,

568
00:34:51.271 --> 00:34:54.230
we eat at Applebee's is,
is,
has progressed beyond the seventh grade.

569
00:34:54.231 --> 00:34:55.064
And that's a fact.

570
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.760
That's actually one of the requirements to manage an Applebee's.
Okay.

571
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:03.860
Your grades have to take a major dip and the seventh grade lost all hope by the

572
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:08.210
10th grade.
All right.
Anyways,
let's plow ahead here.

573
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.220
So anyway,
so I'm sitting there going like,
wow,

574
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:13.400
that's really fucked up that the wild winks of Buffalo.

575
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:18.650
Um,
why is dementia chicken wild?

576
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.040
Um,
so anyways,

577
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.540
I actually went to look up,
uh,

578
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.070
you know,
I don't know,
I was just reading on the,
uh,
the pack yet.
Oh wait,
wait,

579
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:32.450
wait,
wait,
wait.
What the fuck am I talking about?

580
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:36.080
So the fucking clippers ended up eating the spurs and one of the Great Games

581
00:35:36.081 --> 00:35:38.490
I've seen in basketball in a while and great series,

582
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.230
God knows your reason why I watched it because I was hanging out with Verdesian

583
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.750
lie have missed all the hockeys.
You can tell.
I know Tampa Bay's up,

584
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.420
uh,
one game to none on the habs.

585
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.080
I know the ranges are up to nothing on the capitals.

586
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.830
I think that ducks won their first game and I don't know what's going on with

587
00:35:55.831 --> 00:35:58.260
Chicago.
Uh,
we'll bill,

588
00:35:58.261 --> 00:36:00.510
you could have looked it up for the podcast and you know what you could do,

589
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:02.740
you can go fuck yourself.
You could do it till four,

590
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.060
maybe if I fuck this up and makes you feel good because you get to correct me on

591
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:10.430
Twitter.
Um,
anyway,
so,

592
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.590
um,
I ended up,
we came back,
I crash inverse.

593
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.730
He texted me like two hours later and says,
I guess the,
uh,

594
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.150
the Mayweather Pacquiao fight was a shit show.
It was boring as shit and blah,

595
00:36:22.151 --> 00:36:25.530
blah.
And people were basically saying,
and I'm so,

596
00:36:25.531 --> 00:36:28.140
I was kind of looking it up today to see what the deal was and you know,

597
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:32.070
basically boxing purist or at this point,
people who actually watch boxing,

598
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.370
we're saying that it was a great fight and that may,
whether,

599
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:36.470
once again pull it up,

600
00:36:36.471 --> 00:36:41.220
pull it on an absolute clinic and if you actually knew your ass from a fucking

601
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:43.140
hole in the ground when it came to boxing,

602
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.180
you would actually have been able to see that.

603
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.060
And he wouldn't have been pissed moaning and complaining that it was boring.

604
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.200
You know,
which I understand.
Cause I know when I watched UFC,

605
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.580
which I don't know a lot about,

606
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.480
but I watch it on TV and Rogan's always describing,
wow,

607
00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:00.060
the guy's going for a Comoro,
he's going for this and going for that,

608
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.500
the crowd after a while starts to boo when they're laying on the ground cause

609
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:07.050
they think it's boring.
But you know,

610
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:09.360
a defense of those fans when you sit in 200 rows up,

611
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:13.230
he can't see what he's going for.
All right.
It looks like two people cuddling.

612
00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:18.840
Um,
but they can't quite get comfortable.

613
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.490
There were a new couple,
you know what I mean?

614
00:37:20.491 --> 00:37:24.090
That trying to see how the two bodies fit together.
So,
um,

615
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.950
anyways,
so I just started reading about the fight to see what happens.
Um,

616
00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.450
I actually had my wife pay for the fight.
I'm going to watch it tonight.
Um,

617
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:37.210
cause at the very least when I watched and it makes me want to get in shape,
um,

618
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.750
by,
which is a great thing to do.
By the way,

619
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.420
if you hate skipping rope type of fucking championship fight,

620
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:46.590
that goes to distance stay.
You Go,
all right.
Then all you do is you press play.

621
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.170
And when they fight,
you skip rope.
When they sit down,

622
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:52.050
you sit down and then he kept going.
He tried to see how many rounds you can go.

623
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.730
All right.
And as they get tired,

624
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:55.770
you get tired and you feel like you're actually a fighter.

625
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:59.070
And then the end of it,
you realize you just some jerk off in his,

626
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.030
in his underwear skipping rope.
Right.
And it hurts when it hits your toes.

627
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.950
Um,
all right,
so here's how the paper,
I've actually looked up some shit.

628
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:10.020
Here's how the pay per view worked out.
And I own,

629
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.260
I own another apology to the wild wings of Buffalo.

630
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.560
God knows if you ever go out to buffalo,
you've got to watch out for the,

631
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.730
for the not to domesticate it.
Chicken,
it's the wild chicken.
All right,

632
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.910
those fuckers,
those fuckers,
we'll take you out,
man.

633
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:25.710
They'll jump right on the hood of your car and they'll peck through your

634
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:28.830
windshield and there's nothing you can do.
One of them goes for the electrical.

635
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:33.690
So you fucking,
you can't start your car right?
And it's,
it's over.

636
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:38.330
It's like one of those a Alfred Hitchcock movies check.
It's um,

637
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.800
here's other pay per view worked for,
uh,

638
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.140
for bars or anybody basically showing it at a commercial level that was going to

639
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:46.580
charge for the many,
uh,
uh,

640
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.330
the Pacquiao and Mayweather fight bars.

641
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.260
Venues had to pay 25 times their,
their fire code,

642
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.270
fire code being the maximum amount of people that can be live establishment.
Um,

643
00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:02.890
so it's not a fire hazard.
So you had to pay 25 times basically being sold out.

644
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:07.810
So basically out of the gate,
if the bar charts $25 a head,

645
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.800
they needed to sell out the bar just to break even on what they paid for the

646
00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:15.310
fight.
This is why boxing is so fucking dumb.
Okay?

647
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:19.840
You got a sport that he's starting to lose to the UFC or not starting to.

648
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:20.674
It has been,

649
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.610
and this is what the fuck they do when they got this great fight to maybe bring

650
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:28.390
the casual fan back.
You know,
this is what they do.

651
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:33.370
So if you had a bar that was actually worked out,
the numbers 250 capacity,

652
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:34.780
right?
That's the fire code.

653
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.610
That would cost you $6,250 to get the fight.

654
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:44.140
Then if you charge 30 bucks ahead,
you try to make five ahead.
If you sold out,

655
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:49.170
you'd make 1250 he got to spend 66,250 bucks to make 1,250 bucks.

656
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.390
And that's if you fucking sold out.
All right?

657
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.080
And there's nothing stopping the guy across the street from also having the

658
00:39:56.081 --> 00:40:00.280
fight or from people at home going,
hey,
why don't we have fucking,
you know,

659
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:03.010
five people watch it.
It'll cost us 20 bucks ahead.

660
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:06.190
So you're competing with all of that.
There's nothing exclusive about this.

661
00:40:06.191 --> 00:40:10.600
This isn't like,
hey,
you know,
fucking,
uh,
whatever,
Justin beaver,

662
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:16.300
fuck you.
We sells tickets is performing at my venue in my venue alone tonight.

663
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:19.060
Now he's across the street.
He's fucking everywhere,
right?

664
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.440
So Boston boxing basically said to these bars that were taken all the money.

665
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:25.403
Um,

666
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.730
we've taken all the money from your customers to watch the fight.
Okay?

667
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.040
And then you take the booze and the food.

668
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.180
It was essentially like a door deal that was based on the bar taking

669
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:41.530
responsibility to sell out their own venue.
How dumb is that?

670
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:43.670
Like now,

671
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:48.520
not to mention these two guys should have fought five to seven years ago when

672
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:50.890
they were in their prime.
I'm not saying they're not great fighters,

673
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:52.510
not the great fighters of all fucking time.

674
00:40:52.511 --> 00:40:56.400
I'm just saying they should have fought like in the two thousands.

675
00:40:56.401 --> 00:41:00.760
It's 2015 they finally fucking fighting.
Um,

676
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.470
I just think,
I don't know,
boxing is just,

677
00:41:02.471 --> 00:41:06.820
it's just a really poorly run fucking sport.

678
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.590
And the fact that fighters can dodge one another for so long.

679
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.000
I think that that's why

680
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.860
you don't have those great fighting divisions anymore.

681
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:20.800
Like when I was growing up,
okay,

682
00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:24.070
seventies and eighties when I was a kid and then get into my teenage years,

683
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:27.070
boxing was unbelievable.
All right.

684
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.520
And what happened with each decade was they would just,
you know,

685
00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:35.521
the planets aligned and there'd be this ridiculous of talent in one division.

686
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.650
And then that was the division you wanted to watch.
And then the,
like in the,

687
00:41:38.651 --> 00:41:40.580
in the 70s it was the heavyweight division.

688
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:44.420
And then in the 80s it was the middle weight division.

689
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:48.020
And meanwhile there was all these other divisions that had like,

690
00:41:48.021 --> 00:41:51.830
Alexis are Gwalia and boom,
boom,
man sceney and all these,
these superstars.

691
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:57.020
But I think a guy like,
you know,
like nowadays,

692
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.250
then it became the dump.

693
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.690
But back then it was just the wolves at the WBA WBF was all,
it was then.

694
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.620
It was the WBF.

695
00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:08.540
And the WBA the IBF and that would be like the NFL split into fucking three

696
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:10.760
football leagues.
It,
you know,

697
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:14.300
in each one of them had a super bowl champion if fucked the whole thing up.

698
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.320
And then all of a sudden the UFC comes along.

699
00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:20.510
You got everybody under the one umbrella.

700
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.610
And even some of the other groups like UFC of don't exactly what the NFL and the

701
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:30.560
NBA did.
Like when the,
the Aba or the,
uh,
the AFL came out,

702
00:42:30.561 --> 00:42:35.210
the NFL just absorbed that league,
the NBA absorbed the Aba.

703
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.190
The League was,
you know,

704
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.820
that upstart league was then over and then they had just had a monopoly.

705
00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:44.600
So then the best football team or the best basketball team has to play the

706
00:42:44.601 --> 00:42:49.400
second best one.
And then that's the champion fucking,
uh,
boxing.

707
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:53.660
It hasn't been like that forever.
So I think that that's why,

708
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:56.060
<v 0>okay.</v>

709
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.610
<v 1>I think Mayweather's suffers because of that.</v>

710
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.460
Even though he wouldn't probably wouldn't be undefeated because he wasn't

711
00:43:02.461 --> 00:43:07.461
getting the kid who have Mayweather fought back in that division when Hagler

712
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.980
Hearns,
libray,
Leonard Duran,

713
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:14.270
if all of those guys had losses because they all had to fucking fight each
other.

714
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.250
And nowadays it's like,
you know,

715
00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:21.110
fucking you watch Mayweather and Pacquiao for fucking seven years before they

716
00:43:21.111 --> 00:43:23.360
finally fucking fight.
I know a lot of you guys as a bill,

717
00:43:23.361 --> 00:43:26.420
you don't know shit about fighting.
I admit that.
Okay.

718
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.440
But if you want to survive as a fucking league or as a division or whatever the

719
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:33.830
fuck your Sportage,
you got to get the asshole like me to buy the fight.

720
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.600
The casual fan who says dumb shit and the person who actually watches it sits

721
00:43:38.601 --> 00:43:42.410
there and rolls there.
I know the feeling.
I go to super bowl parties.
Right.

722
00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:46.370
I just don't understand why the fuck they doing that because boxing is such an

723
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:48.770
unbelievable sport.
Um,

724
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.910
the only thing that does bug me about it is I am a hockey fan and I hate when

725
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:55.580
they talk about the fighting,
how they got to get the fighting on a hockey.

726
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.430
It's really,
but really you got to get the fighting had a hockey,
but,

727
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.870
but you don't have to get the fighting at a boxing,
you know what I mean?

728
00:44:02.871 --> 00:44:06.620
That's all they do is punch each other in the fucking head to the point that

729
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:08.300
they end up with Parkinson's disease.

730
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

731
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.480
<v 1>Fucking hockey.
They occasionally fight.
It sits a little spice.</v>

732
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:17.160
It's a little fucking flavor to the game.

733
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.640
Well,
he's fucking,
people can't handle it with don't fucking watch.
Ah,

734
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.510
chases bill.
You just did the sporting version of Uniloc at lunch.

735
00:44:26.511 --> 00:44:31.340
Get the fuck out of the country.
Taking your picture,
your fucking Dick.
Doug.

736
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.280
You picked fucking Dick.
Um,

737
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.290
the more exaggerated,
the more,
the more just keeps giving.
Oh,

738
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:43.530
it's the joke that just keeps giving.
All right,
let's do a,

739
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.490
let's do some more questions here,
but I'm having said all that,

740
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.080
who the fuck wouldn't want to be in the shape of Mayweather?

741
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:54.930
A fucking packing out.
Good Lord.
The fucking dedication alone,
that just,

742
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:58.550
that takes,
forget about the fact that you have to push down the sickening,

743
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.900
sickening,
nauseated feeling that there,

744
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:05.901
there was a worldcast class athlete training somewhere in the universe to just

745
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:10.260
beat the living shit out of you,
I'm asked is fucking unreal.
You know,

746
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.410
mean if you're going to get to a fight,
don't you want to just,
just to happen.

747
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.241
Like,
you know,

748
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:17.670
you just sit in there and all of a sudden you're fucking yelling at somebody at

749
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:19.440
the Kentucky Derby,
then it just fucking happens.

750
00:45:19.441 --> 00:45:22.810
But if you have to sit there and think about it and train for it and know that

751
00:45:22.811 --> 00:45:25.130
somebody else is going to do it,
that's just the level of balls that are,

752
00:45:25.131 --> 00:45:29.490
I obviously the old freckled wonder here.
I,
I can't,
I can't relate to that.

753
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:34.710
Um,
all right,
so here we are.
This is the money money podcast,
everybody.
And uh,

754
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:36.360
I do this once a week and once a week.

755
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:39.930
I got the just checking in on your podcast on Thursday,

756

Um,

757
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.670

that's a newer one.

758
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.020
I just do like 30 minutes and then I play some classic hits from,
uh,

759
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.830
from years gone by.
In another world where podcasting was young,

760
00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.810
it was innocent and it was unified unlike boxing.

761
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.500
Um,
if you'd like me to talk about something or whatever,

779
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:22.710
You don't need to tweet at the MLM podcast.

780
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.810
You can just hashtag Jesus is the third version.
You can just tag

<v 6>Okay.</v>

783
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:36.650
<v 1>I mean,
that was just,</v>

784
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.190

789
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.590
Uh,
who in your life would win the world's best mom award?

790
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.860
It's a good problem to have when it's a tie.

791
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.550
Three way tie.
I don't get that.

792
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:23.800

your sister,
your cohost.

what you,

795
00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.730

The last one,

835
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:31.640
five things you can count on when using legal zone for your business.
Ready?

836
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.620
Number one,
reliability.

More than a million people have already trusted legal zoom to help start their

838

If you're looking to incorporate,

841
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:51.530
the right way,
the best way,

842
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:56.531

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.760
helpful God damn support.

And this has been the advertising for this week back to me back in the future

861
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.650
where I was a little more Sopa.

862
00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:15.903
<v 6>Okay.</v>

863
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:19.790
<v 5>Evansville,
here's a something.
Greetings Bill.</v>

864
00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:23.600
I just want to take a moment to thank bill for an incredible show in Evansville,

865
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:26.550
Indiana.
Thank you very much.
I'm actually upset

866
00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:30.390
<v 1>when we rode into town.
I didn't get to go to the,
uh,
the cross side,</v>

867
00:53:30.391 --> 00:53:34.320
grasshopper family restaurant.
I mean it was the fucking name like that.

868
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:38.460
How do I not go in there and eat amongst those water bugs?
I'm kidding.

869
00:53:38.461 --> 00:53:40.960
I'm sure it's a nice clean,
friendly place.
Uh,

870
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.960
he said my face still hurts from laughing also.

871
00:53:42.961 --> 00:53:47.130
I was wondering what were the names of the two opening acts?
Uh,

872
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:51.420
they were both great.
Well that would have been Paul Versey,
v I,
R,
Z,

873
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:54.660
I and Jason Law head spelt like law.

874
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.740
Break the law and head.
I'll kick you in the fucking head.

875
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:01.380
Why can't it be something nice?
Okay.

876
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:05.880
I will fix the cowlick on top of your head gently

877
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:09.650
as they stare at your eyes.
Um,

878
00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:16.650
stare at your eyes.
Look romantically.
Oh fuck though.
Forget it.
All right.

879
00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:21.240
Thursday podcast.
Um,
a pill on the old clips.

880
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.230
Uh,
you talked about an urban legend.
Oh yeah,

881
00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:28.950
I was talking about all those urban legends about,
you remember pop rocks dope.

882
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.830
They was just a kid and he,
he ate a whole box.

883
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.730
He sucked down a whole package of pop rocks in his fucking stomach exploded.

884
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.030
And there was always the one about dude,
there was a kid who he put in,

885
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:42.870
he put an Mat,
which is an eighth of a stick of dynamite,
I believe.

886
00:54:42.871 --> 00:54:44.850
We always thought it was a quarter stick.
I think it's an eighth.

887
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.960
Stuck it in the back of some kid's pocket litter in a blue,

888
00:54:48.961 --> 00:54:50.250
half the kid's ass off.

889
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:55.140
So this guy says I'm willing to mid eighties.
My brother,

890
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.030
my stepbrother did just that.

891
00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:02.510
He had to get skin grafted from his thigh to his ass.

892
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.650
It's no urban legend from New Jersey.
Oh,
maybe that's where it started.

893
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.230
They always say there's a little bit of truth in all of that shit.

894
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:14.100
Is that what they say?
That is what they say to Billy.

895
00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.910
Holy Shit.
The Thursday podcast is the best thing you could've done.

896
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:21.180
You are a genius.
I'm not a genius.
Andrew came up with it.
Uh,

897
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.650
the old clips are hilarious.

898
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:26.100
I love dropping it on the middle of an old school podcast catching you in a

899
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:27.870
random moot.
Yeah,
that is the thing.

900
00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:32.871
Cause my vibe on this Thursday then it connects with whatever the fuck I was

901
00:55:33.091 --> 00:55:36.540
talking about on some Monday in like 2009 or 10 or something.

902
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.880
So I guess that would be a weird little mash up.
As the kids say,
I'm,

903
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:46.340
this person said I listen to a lot of podcasts.
Over time some of them changed.

904
00:55:46.341 --> 00:55:49.740
The hosts get egos and the vibe is different.

905
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:52.890
I love how you're 10 times bigger than you were when you,

906
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:56.850
I'll look at this whole fucking ball rubbing thing here.
Did I write this?

907
00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.500
I'm 10 times bigger than I was everybody when I started the podcast,

908
00:56:01.501 --> 00:56:05.550
but I still act the same.
All freckles is down to her.
What,
when you're a balding,

909
00:56:05.551 --> 00:56:06.390
redheaded male,

910
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:11.360
you really don't have the opportunity to take your shirt off in VIP.
Do you?
Huh?

911
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.570
Spinning around your head.
I swear to God,
if I had pigment I would be a much,

912
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:20.970
oh my God,
I the Ego.
I would fucking have you kidding me.
If I had pigment,

913
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:23.760
a full head of hair,
you guys wouldn't even know me.
Um,

914
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:28.770
the day that they actually come up with a pill cause I would never do that

915
00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:33.220
fucking,
you know,
taking hair from the back of your fucking head,
putting on,

916
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.500
I would never do that,
but I'm not,
I'm not fucking doing that.
Numb it up my head.

917
00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:40.320
It's just like,
all right dude.
Phil,
why don't you just admit that it's over?

918
00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:45.810
All right.
Fucking buzz it down.
Grow some sort of facial hair,

919
00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:48.350
you know,
or just shave your face and let people look like,

920
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:53.600
just make them look at a rapidly approaching 50 year old adult baby.

921
00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:03.130
How mad.
Don't do this by the way,
cause you'll get in trouble.

922
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:07.360
But how fucking funny and how mad would the person get if you walked up to a

923
00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:12.100
fucking guy who had his head clean shaved and his face.

924
00:57:12.101 --> 00:57:15.760
He didn't have any facial hair.
Right.
And he's in his forties or whatever.

925
00:57:15.761 --> 00:57:17.620
You just walked up to him.
He's sitting in a bar,

926
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:21.690
minding his own business and you walked up when you're underneath his genuine
oh,

927
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:25.900
Gucci,
Gucci,
Gucci,
Gucci,
Boo Boo.

928
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.330
Like how far did you get away before that person?

929
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.220
I think I would know somebody touching you would make you mad.

930
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.480
Other than that a man think I'd laugh.
Um,
but don't do that.
Everybody.

931
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:42.430
Okay.
The world is a,
is a bad enough place you really don't need,
you know,

932
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:46.540
you don't,
do you really need a bar fight?
Think about that people.

933
00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:50.140
At what point in you in your life do you sit there and be like,
you know,

934
00:57:50.141 --> 00:57:54.400
what would be a good asset to my life right now?
Both spears spiritually,

935
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.510
personally and legally.
A nice knock down drag out bar fight.

936
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.570
Although that would be funny though if that happened.

937
00:58:01.571 --> 00:58:05.740
And then you guys actually decided to work it out on like judge Judy.
You know,

938
00:58:05.741 --> 00:58:09.040
when she comes out there,
I'll fucking extra angry for the fucking,
uh,

939
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:11.950
you know,
for the TV cameras.

940
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.840
And you went out there and though you know the ball guys guy go,
ah,
you know,

941
00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:20.160
it's my mail business and this might come up,
hey,
hey,

942
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:25.090
put his finger Charlie bit my finger and it hurt.
He put it on,

943
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:28.620
I don't know,
Amit cheek and anatomy chin.

944
00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:34.070
And what did he say at that time?
Uh,
he said,
uh,
coachee killed [inaudible]

945
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:36.940
right.
And I didn't like it.

946
00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:43.090
I don't know like it to be English or whatever the fuck I was just trying to do.

947
00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:45.370
Right.
There's no robbery.

948
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:50.280
I got to get back to fucking peaky blinders when I get back on two episodes and

949
00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:52.680
I'm going to watch every fucking episode I can before I go to all,

950
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.410
to all my shows in Boston there.
Um,
all right,

951
00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:01.600
what else was there?
Uh,
thanks for the last man.
My days go by much quicker.

952
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:06.550
No worries.
Everybody look at that.
The Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

953
00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:08.050
Monday morning podcast.

954
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:12.510
The just checking in on your podcast to make it fucking quicker is really look

955
00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.820
at people are liking it.
Check it out if you can.

956
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:18.280
Um,
oh shit.
All right.

957
00:59:18.281 --> 00:59:21.290
I gotta read another advertising came before I get into the rest of these.
Uh,

958
00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:25.590
once again,
this is bill burr in the future.
Desperately trying to read out loud

959
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:34.070
my Jesus.
We're back in the past.
They're actually,

960
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:38.210
when you're listening to all of this,
it's all in the past,
isn't it?
I don't know.

961
00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.960
All right.
Booing at the draft from a lady.
Hey Bill.

962
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:46.990
My mother in law is a huge sports fan and she insisted on watching the draft.

963
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:51.650
I have never seen the draft before and I was really shocked at the rude behavior

964
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:55.430
of the spectators.
Well,
you've obviously never gone to a sporting event.

965
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.180
I was going to a sporting event is watching a bunch of people that probably

966
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:01.070
can't catch a ball or maybe they could,

967
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:05.640
but now they're just old and out of shape.
Just,
you know,

968
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.330
just trash and people that can do what they,
they could never do.

969
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.270
That's what it is.
Um,
anyways.

970
01:00:11.271 --> 01:00:16.271
Is that how it normally goes down or is it because it was held in Chicago as a

971
01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:21.560
Wisconsinite?
I would've thought it was a Wisconsin or a Wisconsinite.

972
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:22.760
Uh,

973
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.760
that lives in a tourist destination for those damn fib.

974
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.450
He's
fucking idiot bastards.

975
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:36.380
Oh,
fucking Illinois bastards.
I can't close a,

976
01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:40.040
as we call them in door con door county,

977
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.330
I instantly blame Chicago for all the [inaudible].

978
01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.810
Are My instincts to correct or is it always like that?

979
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.110
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
No,
you're instincts are not correct.

980
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:56.240
And as far as how Wisconsinites view people from Chicago,

981
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.340
you know,
that's just standard behavior standards.
Human behavior.

982
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.150
You don't like your neighbor,
you don't like your neighbor.
This town,

983
01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:07.100
his rivals with the town next to it.

984
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.220
This state doesn't like the state next to it.

985
01:01:10.221 --> 01:01:12.150
This country doesn't like the country next to it.
You need,

986
01:01:12.151 --> 01:01:13.550
you just keep making it bigger and bigger.

987
01:01:13.551 --> 01:01:16.820
This continent doesn't like this continent.
You can go right up.

988
01:01:16.821 --> 01:01:21.821
Just basically familiarity breeds contempt and it takes an unbelievable level of

989
01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:27.140
maturity for you to be sitting up there and cheese land to look down at mustache

990
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:30.040
city and see the good in it.
You know,

991
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.580
especially when they're coming up there de vacation and in your area,

992
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.100
you're not going to like it.
When I lived in New York City,

993
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:42.101
I fucking hated walking through time square bunch of fucking families with their

994
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:46.670
kids going to the fucking m and m store.
You know,

995
01:01:46.671 --> 01:01:50.210
they actually made you wish that it was still peep shows,
which was disgusting.

996
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:53.450
It was fucking Gross Times Square back in the day was gross.

997
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:58.790
And now they've gone the other way,
which just a,
you know,

998
01:01:58.791 --> 01:02:01.700
it's a lot of big people in Jean shorts,

999
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.680
plodding through traffic,
not knowing where they're going.
And uh,

1000
01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:07.880
there's nothing like a giant,

1001
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:12.920
a giant group of people likes to do more than to just stop and stand in the

1002
01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:14.810
middle of the sidewalk looking around,

1003
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:18.830
waiting for someone to make a fucking decision,
you know,

1004
01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:24.280
a bunch of followers.
All right.
Walking into the Hershey Kiss store,

1005
01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.013
you know,

1006
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.270
buying some fucking New York tee shirt that has fucking,
you know,

1007
01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:34.450
you buy the New York tee shirt with a picture of John Lennon on it wearing the

1008
01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:37.240
New York tee shirt.
You want to do that shit.
Yeah.
You fucking hate that stuff.

1009
01:02:37.241 --> 01:02:41.050
So no,
I don't think it has to do with that.
I mean,
obviously you know,

1010
01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.990
Philly's known for Boeing,
uh,

1011
01:02:43.991 --> 01:02:48.930
New York City's known for bullying Boston's north of dope.
You know,
it say,
yeah,

1012
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.151
you know,

1013
01:02:49.151 --> 01:02:53.650
it's a shit show and people also fly in for the draft if you can believe that

1014
01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.130
they fly in for the draft.

1015
01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:04.180
I will never understand that.
I already did a bit about it on my last special,

1016
01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:06.190
but I will never understand that.

1017
01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.120
It's like going down to the DMV when you don't have to.

1018
01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:11.740
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1019
01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.450
<v 1>Someone's going to take the test for you.</v>

1020
01:03:13.451 --> 01:03:16.650
All you gotta do is just see how they did the next day as you're reading and

1021
01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.890
fucking English muffin.
There's no fucking reason to go down there.
Um,

1022
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:22.540
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1023
01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.440
<v 1>I haven't even looked.</v>

1024
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:27.980
I haven't even stopped to even look to see who my team took.
Um,

1025
01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:29.160
<v 2>okay.</v>

1026
01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.800
<v 1>And I don't give a shit.
I mean I care,
I want them to do well,</v>

1027
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:34.380
but like I'll wait till the football season to see how they do.

1028
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:38.250
But I guess those are the people that get into it a lot more younger ones don't

1029
01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:39.084
want to.

1030
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.870
Those are the people actually know the names of like the GMS and the higher ups.

1031
01:03:42.871 --> 01:03:45.690
And like I,
I just don't have fucking time to get into it to that level.

1032
01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:50.400
You know what I mean?
I have too many other things that waste my time.
Um,
so no,

1033
01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:53.250
I wouldn't blame it on Chicago.
I love Chicago.
I love Wisconsin.

1034
01:03:53.251 --> 01:03:55.380
I think you guys are all great standing from the outside.

1035
01:03:55.381 --> 01:03:56.790
I don't know what your fucking problem is.

1036
01:03:57.090 --> 01:04:00.300
The same way I look at the Middle East.
What is the fucking problem over there?

1037
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.070
One of your guys,
if everybody just became atheists in the Middle East,
you know,

1038
01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.440
and they find something else.
I don't like it.
Shoes.
It's blowing them up.

1039
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:13.950
Um,
game.
Show a bill.

1040
01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:17.520
If you could be on any game show from any time period.
I want a great question.

1041
01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.680
What would it be?
I'm a huge,
I'm back in the day.

1042
01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:23.220
It was a big game show fan when I was growing up during this summer,

1043
01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.920
we didn't have a pool,
right?
We lived on a busy street.

1044
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:30.980
We used to watch the prices,
right?
Every day Ben Happen,
uh,
uh,
uh,
data,

1045
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:35.610
data,
data,
data.
Is that the one?

1046
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:42.080
Well,
the thinking music on the match gains,
boom,
boom,

1047
01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.450
Bam,
Bam.

1048
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:49.660
What the fucking why Wah pedal was big in the 70s.
All right.
Um,

1049
01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.470
let's see.
I picture you on the prices,
right?
Good call.

1050
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.170
God knows you're not cut out for jeopardy.
Fuck you.
Or wheel of fortune.
Kidding.

1051
01:04:59.171 --> 01:05:02.080
You're a smart bass.
And on that,
on a wheel of fortune,
dude,

1052
01:05:02.081 --> 01:05:05.980
you can have everything but the vows and I still can't get it.
Um,

1053
01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.490
I'm really bad at that.
Like you see,
I'm not good at reading out loud.

1054
01:05:09.491 --> 01:05:13.810
I'm not good at reading in general.
Everything gets all jumbled up.
You know,

1055
01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.940
my eyes travel faster than my brain can process it.
It's an shit show.

1056
01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:19.201
Uh,
he goes,

1057
01:05:19.201 --> 01:05:23.730
I see you teaching old ladies how to put in demonstrating what,

1058
01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:28.420
how to pot and demonstrating the wheel going around.
Oh yeah.

1059
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.930
I thought you meant as a contestant.
You're talking about hosting.

1060
01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:32.720
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1061
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.240
<v 1>All right.</v>

1062
01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.950
Or a demonstrating the wheel going around one full rotation and not to mention

1063
01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.760
the kisses on the cheek from all the fucking ladies.

1064
01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.170
And instead of Barker's beauties,
it'd be birds.
Beauties.
Your thoughts are,

1065
01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:50.850
if I can host
any show,
um,

1066
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:55.050
I kind of liked the family feud,
but this too,
you got to talk to too many people.

1067
01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.500
I'd rather just deal with the head of both families.
Like a mob thing.

1068
01:05:58.501 --> 01:06:01.740
Like let's have a little fucking sit down.
All right.
You know,

1069
01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:04.890
you seem like a reasonable person,
but you know that shit show behind you.

1070
01:06:04.891 --> 01:06:06.030
I really don't want to get involved in.

1071
01:06:06.031 --> 01:06:08.670
So why don't you ask them what the fuck they think and then you say it.

1072
01:06:08.671 --> 01:06:12.690
How about that?
All right,
so I would not last long on that.

1073
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:16.630
A wheel of fortune.
MMM.

1074
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.400
I could actually,
I wouldn't mind host in that one.

1075
01:06:21.401 --> 01:06:23.110
The sound of the wheel is annoying to me

1076
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.470
and I don't like when they fucking lose it to her and they go,
Ooh,

1077
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.910
that we'll get to me after awhile.

1078
01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.780
Cause I would think like that would be the soundtrack to my career at that
point.

1079
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:39.450
Although Vanna white still,
they're still looking on,
you know,

1080
01:06:39.451 --> 01:06:41.700
she threw me a glance with those beautiful fucking eyes.

1081
01:06:41.701 --> 01:06:45.480
I that could be a fun one.
Uh,
prices,
right.
I mean that's the iconic one.

1082
01:06:45.481 --> 01:06:47.820
I mean that's the fucking patriots.
That's the Yankees.

1083
01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:50.870
As much as I hate to say the Canadians and game shows,
right.

1084
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:54.060
It is fucking is actually to be fair,

1085
01:06:54.061 --> 01:06:58.730
it's the green bay packers because they wanted the most NFL titles of Superbowls

1086
01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.500
combined.
I would have to say that.
So,
uh,

1087
01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:03.460
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1088
01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.010
<v 1>prices,
right.
I,
you know,
I like about the prices,
right.</v>

1089
01:07:07.011 --> 01:07:09.680
Is you're not confined to just one game.

1090
01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:10.990
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1091
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:13.090
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Like wheel of fortune is the one game,</v>

1092
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:15.130
the spinning the wheel,
spinning the wheel,
spinning the wheel.

1093
01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.360
Fucking family feud.
I asked you a name,

1094
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:24.370
a sound of a Fart,
and you said surveys such,

1095
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.730
you know,
whatever.
I think you're just doing the same thing.

1096
01:07:27.731 --> 01:07:31.120
Fucking over and over again.
Right,
but the price is right.

1097
01:07:31.121 --> 01:07:35.020
There's all those different games,
all the different games.
And then you know,

1098
01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:38.530
you got to halftime like a sporting event.
I think you nailed it,
dude.

1099
01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.670
Remember card sharks,
all of it higher.

1100
01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:48.200
All of it lower.
It's fucking stupid.
It's really hard.

1101
01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:50.030
You know if he can come up with a good game show,

1102
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:53.300
one of the most brilliant ones ever was,
who wants to be a millionaire?

1103
01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:56.250
That's such a fucking simple idea.

1104
01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.640
I can't believe I didn't fucking thing to do that.
Sure.

1105
01:07:59.641 --> 01:08:01.200
It's helping be hosting this podcast right now.

1106
01:08:01.201 --> 01:08:03.240
Be Drinking myself to death somewhere on a fucking,

1107

<v 1>I don't know what,
none of the islands be getting sick.
Dayas stroke.</v>

1109
01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:10.570
I don't know where the fuck I'd be,
but I wouldn't be sitting here right now.

1110
01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:14.740
Who wants to be a millionaire?
Hey,

I mean right there,

1111
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:17.870

01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:20.600
I'm going to come up with a game show for like the porno network called who

1114
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:27.170
I don't.
Right.
There you go.
There's your show.

1115
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:33.800
Then you just ask like fucking questions about,

1116
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:37.370
whatever sex brim job.
Is that your final answer?

1117
01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.300
Financial Room Job Doodoo do.
You are correct.

1118
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.290
Um,
all right,
let's move on to the next one.

1119
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:50.360
Mary woman takes man's leg.
Okay.

1120
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:55.900
Hey Bill,

Fuck a woman finally wrote in here.
Hey Bill,

I am 19 years old just graduating high school and not going and going to enlist

1123
01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:06.890
in the U S Marine Corps.
Uh,
just a little about me in parentheses.

1124
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.180
I have been listening to your podcast for about a year now and I find you

1125
01:09:11.181 --> 01:09:15.950
hilarious.
Anyways,
I came across this video and apparently this lady steel,

1126
01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:20.930
this steel's this guy's leg when he goes to sleep and has been holding it for

1127
01:09:20.931 --> 01:09:23.420
ransom because this guy cheated on her.

1128
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.000
I just wanted to get your take on this,

1129
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:28.040
sent you the best and discussing the ladies.

1130
01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:31.820
Thanks for all the labs and go fuck yourself.
So wait a minute,

1131
01:09:31.821 --> 01:09:34.970
this guy's got a fake leg,
obviously.
No bill,

1132
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:38.540
he's got a real one and she sought it off and fucking,
I dunno,

1133
01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.750
what do they do then?
They stick you stump in a fire.

1134
01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:43.160
That's how they used to do it in the,
uh,

1135
01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.180
the cowboy movies to cauterize or whatever that fucking word is.

1136
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.010
Clarify your fucking artery.
I Dunno.

1137
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.190
Stop the bleeding.
Does that even work or is that just some Hollywood shit?

1138
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:59.720
I have no fucking idea.
I don't pretend to be a doctor or even look like one.

1139
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:05.330
Um,
what do I think about that?
Well,
he fucked around.
Hell hath no fury.

1140
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:11.090
Well,
how long has she had the leg?
You know what I would do?

1141
01:10:11.091 --> 01:10:13.400
I just buy another one.
I light up my car.

1142
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.300
I'd buy another one and I would fucking,
you know,

1143
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:21.950
walk awkwardly over to our house and I would just be like,
really?
You know,

1144
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:25.220
what do I think about that?
I think as she should give it back.

1145
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:29.900
I understand why she fucking did it,
but,
um,

1146
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:33.020
that's that bullshit that women can get away with where they can get away with

1147
01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:37.130
destruction of property in that type of shit.
Like,
you know,

1148
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.250
they can throw all your shit out the fucking window,

1149
01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:42.680
light it on fire and do all this type of crap.

1150
01:10:42.681 --> 01:10:46.640
And the cops show up just laughing.
You know,
I'd been there.

1151
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.180
I fucked around and my girl,
I got a dick too,
buddy.

1152
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.800
This is what happens every once in a while.
They like to shit on fire.

1153
01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.430
She's like a fucking Allah cat and a fucking year.
Um,

1154
01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.760
what do I think about it?
I think it's fucking hilarious.
The obviously,
uh,

1155
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.670
you know,
you fucked around.

1156
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.280
What are you going to do but get mad about that.
You got it.

1157
01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:13.100
I would think that if I had a fake leg
and I was fucking around,

1158
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.680
uh,
I would be wearing that thing to bed.
You know what I mean?

1159
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:18.960
Or at least I'd have a backup light.
I think in general,

1160
01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:22.000
once you have a backup leg,
I mean,

1161
01:11:22.001 --> 01:11:24.880
even people who can't see got a backup pair of glasses,
right?

1162
01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:30.810
She'd have another leg.
You know what do you have a fucking egg?
You know,

1163
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.490
you know his cell phone charges.
I have.

1164
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:37.000
I fucking lose those things all the time and I know what people would note with

1165
01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:40.330
willy.
One legger thinking,
dude,
you have any idea how expensive they are now?

1166
01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.250
I got both of my legs,
but I can tell you this,

1167
01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:44.680
I cut back on the drinking to have a spare.

1168
01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.253
<v 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1169
01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.620
<v 1>I'd be still watching a square TV before I would buy a flat screen.
Okay?</v>

1170
01:11:53.621 --> 01:11:56.800
I wouldn't buy a flat screen TV until I had an extra fucking leg that that's a

1171
01:11:56.801 --> 01:12:00.760
debt's a fucking guarantee.
Okay?
You can take that to the Goddamn Bank.

1172
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:04.510
All right?
But you know,
let's get to the real story here.

1173
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.850
Let's talk about this fucking Mack Daddy.

1174
01:12:06.851 --> 01:12:11.540
He only has one God damn leg and he's still fucking slaying it.
You know?

1175
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:15.850
I bet that got her fucking goat.
The fact that,
you know,

1176
01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.480
this guy's got one leg and she's sitting there,

1177
01:12:17.481 --> 01:12:21.170
pat yourself on the back of what a good person she is.
That she's,
you know,

1178
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:26.300
that she can see.
I don't care about appendages.
I care.

1179
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:29.150
I care about what's in here now,

1180
01:12:29.151 --> 01:12:33.980
what's hanging off your pelvis except for that your Dick,

1181
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:37.530
you know.
Um,
but who knows?

1182
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.070
Maybe Bruce Jenner doesn't want his leave.
He,
you test.
Maybe you could buy his.

1183
01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.500
Sure.
It's a little bit older than you are,
but you know,

1184
01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:49.330
I don't need to cath is your coq one.
I'm not trying to belittle you.

1185
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.810
I am not Joe put words in my mouth.

1186
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:57.610
Um,
yeah,
I,
I,
you know,

1187
01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:02.110
that's fucking hilarious.
I can't come into work today.
Why?
Well,

1188
01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:06.870
I fucked around on my girlfriend.
She took my fake leg.
Oh,

1189
01:13:06.871 --> 01:13:10.980
you're going to hear is the boss
on the other side?
Fuck you.

1190
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.720
What are you going to do buddy?
Hot Down here and kick my ass.

1191
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:19.520
You're gonna fall down.
Um,
anyways.
All right,

1192
01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:22.110
so I'm sure we're going to hear from the people with one fucking leg out there.

1193
01:13:22.111 --> 01:13:24.960
You know,
quit your bitching.
Okay?

1194
01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:30.390
Can always be worse.
All right?
It can always be fucking worse.

1195
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.050
You know what I mean?
For every person out there with one leg,
all right?

1196
01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:36.120
There's someone else in a loveless marriage.
Okay?

1197
01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:39.450
And that's even worse every fucking day.

1198
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:43.350
Waking up next to that person,
man,

1199
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:45.960
or a woman and not feeling a fucking thing.

1200
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.120
As they look into your eyes and they hand you that car,
and on Valentine's Day,

1201
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.980
you might as well be talking to a chest of drawers.
Um,
all right.

1202
01:13:56.630 --> 01:14:01.500
Wow.
That was dark.
All right.
Gathering and protesting verse riding.
Bill,

1203
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:06.300
I sympathize with the black community through all of this.
Oh God,

1204
01:14:06.301 --> 01:14:09.510
this sounds like it's going to go off the rails.
Hey,
I have a black friend,

1205
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:15.050
but said that.
Um,
all right.
It's ridiculous.

1206
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:16.640
Uh,
some cops,

1207
01:14:16.641 --> 01:14:20.840
not all of them can be total assholes with pent up anger and absolutely no

1208
01:14:20.841 --> 01:14:23.900
control over their violent actions.
And it's no excuse.

1209
01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.250
He shouldn't have to do that job unless you're a saint who also knows how to

1210
01:14:28.251 --> 01:14:31.610
kick ass.
It's fucking hilarious.
You want a superhero at that point.

1211
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:35.870
Where do you stand on the protests slash?
Riots?
Where's the line?

1212
01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:40.040
Obviously destroying someone's business is ridiculous and doesn't promote social

1213
01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:44.950
change.
But I also sometimes
he just,
he misses a word,

1214
01:14:44.951 --> 01:14:46.740
but I also sometimes think,
I think he was supposed to,

1215
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:47.980
you got to crack a few eggs,

1216
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:52.870
please use the next five to 10 minutes to solve this social problem.
Hilarious.

1217
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:58.240
Um,
I dunno when I watched that you're just watching the results of a,

1218
01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:02.450
you know,
what happened a long time ago.

1219
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:07.280
It's the fallout of all of that.
Um,

1220
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:13.460
the genius of a saying that one race was better than another race.

1221
01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.390
So you could fuck over both races,

1222
01:15:15.391 --> 01:15:19.560
but you adjusted how you were doing it and you get to keep all the money at the

1223
01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:23.770
top,
right?
Like you're basically sticking a dick and everybody's ass,

1224
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.120
but you go balls deep with one people and another people,

1225
01:15:27.121 --> 01:15:29.340
you're only halfway in and then you get,

1226
01:15:29.341 --> 01:15:32.820
so then the genius of that is you got someone with half a dick in their ass

1227
01:15:32.821 --> 01:15:36.290
actually feeling lucky because it's not balls deep.
Right.

1228
01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:41.390
And just the fallout of that is what you're watching.

1229
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.880
So make any sense other than I can't just totally blame super rich people on

1230
01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:50.810
this.
So the controlling people throughout the centuries.
But I will say that,
uh,

1231
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:54.530
just generally speaking,
even at horseshoe with a lady in Wisconsin,

1232
01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.720
just looking for the bad in Chicago,

1233
01:15:56.721 --> 01:16:01.280
people in blaming all of the bullshit behavior on a

1234
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:07.390
draft day for the city of Chicago.
Um,

1235
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:09.220
I just think unfortunately,

1236
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:14.480
the inherent nature of people is to,
uh,
be selfish,
conch,

1237
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.220
to be fearful,
to want more,
to be worried about tomorrow and,
uh,

1238
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.550
to want to be a,
I dunno,

1239
01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:27.580
feel a little better than the other person may look at me at the Derby right now

1240
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.400
where I was sitting.
I was two steps above where those people were standing.

1241
01:16:31.401 --> 01:16:35.360
And when I stood up,
I could still see the fucking race,
but I was like,

1242
01:16:35.361 --> 01:16:39.650
I am a sinner.
You are a standard.
You are less than me.
And next thing you know,

1243
01:16:39.651 --> 01:16:44.200
I'm yelling at this person,
like I built the whole fucking area.
Right?
Um,

1244
01:16:44.210 --> 01:16:46.340
I just think it's in our nature to not get along.

1245
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:49.880
I hate to say that because it's the easiest fucking thing to do because it

1246
01:16:49.881 --> 01:16:54.620
doesn't take any effort
getting annoyed by somebody as effortless.

1247
01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:58.730
Actually having empathy and seeing where the fuck they are coming from or maybe

1248
01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:02.270
thinking about how you should say something and respecting somebody.

1249
01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.880
It just takes a lot of fucking effort,
you know?

1250
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:10.140
And you know when the heat of the moment that usually doesn't happen and a,

1251
01:17:10.141 --> 01:17:14.790
there you go.
I overly simplified the whole fucking thing,

1252
01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:18.960
but I think it's a,
I dunno,

1253
01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.350
I've been through Baltimore,
I've been through Detroit,

1254
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.550
parts of Cleveland,
parts of Buffalo,
that rust belt and stuff.
Then you know,

1255
01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:28.920
parts of the south.
Now some of the places I went through,

1256
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:33.480
you can't believe how people are living in this country and it's just fucking

1257
01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:35.460
wrong.
It's wrong.

1258
01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:39.000
And then we're over there allegedly trying to rescue people in other countries,

1259
01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:40.520
which is the dumbest shit ever.
It isn't.

1260
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.800
We're just taking their natural resources and make it,
I mean,
we are,

1261
01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.080
I don't want get into all of that shit,

1262
01:17:46.081 --> 01:17:48.480
but I just don't think that this country is sitting there looking at other

1263
01:17:48.481 --> 01:17:50.100
countries going,
God damn it.

1264
01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:52.420
<v 0>Fuck yeah,</v>

1265
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:57.530
<v 1>they're just not free.
We got to do something about,</v>

1266
01:17:57.531 --> 01:18:02.510
this is bullshit.
I don't,
but I don't buy into any of it.
It's a,
yeah.

1267
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:06.060
And this is another thing too.
I have no fucking idea how to turn that around.

1268
01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.160
No fucking way.
I turned it around on a societal level.

1269
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.900
I can't tell though on an individual level,
uh,

1270
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:18.840
you can totally turn around your life without a fucking doubt.

1271
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:21.350
You just have to fucking,

1272
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:23.300
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1273
01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.220
<v 1>you just can't.
You got to become unstoppable.</v>

1274
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:30.920
And the more down the fucking shit slide you are the morning stoppable you have

1275
01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:34.160
to fucking be.
And that's just the way it is.
Life isn't fucking fair.

1276
01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.310
And for as bad as you got it,
somebody got a fucking worst.

1277
01:18:37.311 --> 01:18:41.270
I mean there's a guy with one fucking leg who can't go to work cause he stuck

1278
01:18:41.271 --> 01:18:45.230
his dick into something else,
which he's fucking wired to do.
You know?

1279
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.600
I mean that woman taken out of the guy's leg.

1280
01:18:47.601 --> 01:18:52.130
She's basically saying God is wrong,
you know,
but she won't get called on it.

1281
01:18:52.131 --> 01:18:56.730
We'll shoot.
Yeah.
Did any of that make any sense?

1282
01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.670
I actually started daydream and halfway through that,
um,
this bill burn,

1283
01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:03.420
this has been the Monday morning podcast.

1284
01:19:03.421 --> 01:19:06.720
I would like all of you to go fuck yourself and I'll talk to you next.

1285
01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:08.520
I'll actually taught,
I'll check in on you on Thursday,

1286
01:19:08.521 --> 01:19:12.150
but I'm basically going to talk to you.
I talked to you every Monday,
Thursdays.

1287
01:19:12.151 --> 01:19:13.500
I'm just checking in on you,
you know,

1288
01:19:13.501 --> 01:19:16.590
just poking my head in seeing how the fuck you doing.
But this,
this day here,

1289
01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.300
this is the real shit,
right?

1290
01:19:18.301 --> 01:19:20.910
And if you'd like the real shit and it is a pile of shit here.

1291
01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.710
And if you would like to,
uh,

1292
01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:27.170
contribute to the Monday morning podcast effortlessly,
well,

1293
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:28.590
this actually takes a little bit of thought.

1294
01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.080
Next time you go to Amazon to buy something,
just click on,

1295
01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:32.520
go to [inaudible] dot com,

1296
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:35.820
click on the podcast page and then just click on the Amazon,

1297
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:38.880
a little fucking app there.
Whatever the fuck you think you call it,

1298
01:19:38.881 --> 01:19:42.720
the banner ad,
it'll take you right to Amazon and then buy something if you want.

1299
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.823
And if you do,

1300
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:47.100
I get a little credit for driving some traffic there was already going to go

1301
01:19:47.101 --> 01:19:50.730
there anyways.
They kicked me a little bit of fucking money.
Um,

1302
01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.690
they're basically whoring off the love that they think you have for me in this

1303
01:19:54.691 --> 01:19:57.840
podcast.
That's what they're doing.
They're trying to pile on that shit.

1304
01:19:58.580 --> 01:19:58.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1305
01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.960
<v 1>You know what I mean?
I don't want to talking about,
um,</v>

1306
01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.590
thanks to everybody sincerely for the last two weeks,
um,

1307
01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:08.310
I wiped out.
I am tired,

1308
01:20:08.311 --> 01:20:11.700
but it was one of the great experiences that I've had in my standup career to

1309
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:15.360
get to go to all these cities that I had never been to.
Um,

1310
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:17.040
other than New Orleans.

1311
01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:19.530
I had never been to any of these other ones as far as I can remember.

1312
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:23.790
And it was awesome.
The people were great,
the crowds were awesome.
And uh,
oh,

1313
01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:28.710
people ask me about the Billy Bible belt poster.
Do I have any leftovers?
Yes,

1314
01:20:28.711 --> 01:20:33.330
I do.
Yes I do.
I've got a couple hundred left.
Um,

1315
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:37.380
and I just shipped them back to my house.
They're all going to be autographed.

1316
01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.600
Okay.
And uh,
they will be available for sale on my,
uh,

1317
01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.750
on my website as soon as,
as soon as I get home.

1318
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:49.830
Probably take me about a week to put them up there.
Uh,
they are high quality.

1319
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:52.440
I forget what size they are,
but they are a nice size.

1320
01:20:52.441 --> 01:20:55.810
Just look at some of the tweet Twitter pictures of them.
Um,

1321
01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:58.350
those will be available,
but when they're gone,
they're gone.

1322
01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:02.730
I'm not making any more.
I even get one.
I didn't need one.

1323
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:07.410
I fucking did.
They shows.
Oh,
all right.
Go fuck yourselves.

1324
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.400
I'll talk to you next week.
