00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.660
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.310
November 3rd,
2014 how you doing?
Jesus Christ.

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.090
I'm trying to get comfortable here is what's going on.
I'm in a,

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm actually doing this,
uh,
my podcast in a studio,
which I never do.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.250
I always do it at home,
laying in my fucking underwear.

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.360
Right now I'm in a studio,
the all new,
all things comedy network,

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.680
podcast studios,
one of the first guys over here to do a do my podcast.

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.970
Then I have to tell you it's a wonderful experience so far and I already know

9
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.730
what some you assholes are going to say.
Now that I've given that information,

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.370
that I'm not doing my podcast lying down you like,
dude,

11
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.410
you're funnier when you're not seated.

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.310
Can sit there and break my balls about that.
I don't know.
Give a shit.

13
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.490
Go ahead and do it because by the time you give me shit,

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.100
this thing is already recorded.
And what the fuck do I care?

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.210
I've gotten on with my life.
I'm down the street having a snow cone,
you know,

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.700
that's the life I'm living.
Huh?

17
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.350
When did that you're not about this life hit the white mainstream.

18
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:06.590
If I hear one more white person fucking say that like they,

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.480
that's gets going to be the next um,
African American,
uh,

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.410
expression that they're going to have like old white grandmother sang in fucking

21
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:21.390
cheesy comics.
Sorry.
Cheesy comedies.
I,

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.720
when I sipped it,
it does sound like a fart there.
I just sip some water there.

23
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.330
You're not about this life.
Oh Shit.

24
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:33.190
The old white lady said the thing the young black kids say if only she could

25
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:38.170
give the finger and there was an orangutan,
you'd have yourself a comedy.
Um,

26
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.550
all right.
So how the,
how the hell are you?
I know I had a long ass frigging yeah.

27
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.230
Week and weekend.
Uh,
ended up going to a wedding.

28
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.680
You guys like going to those things went to weddings.
You know,

29
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:51.680
I loved about this wedding.
There was no dancing.
Okay.

30
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:56.300
And when you're as white as me,
that is a very enjoyable moment.

31
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.000
You know what I mean?
Oh my God,

32
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.030
this is going to be booze and there's going to be no dancing and you're going to

33
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.660
have a quick beautiful ceremony.
Uh,

34
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.670
is there any way I can retroactively pay for this?

35
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.370
This beautiful service was tremendous.

36
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.750
It's one of the best weddings I've been to.

37
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.500
So I want to thank those two people who got married for having such a wonderful,

38
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.270
beautiful,
yet quick service.
That's what you want,
by the way,

39
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.710
when you get married,

40
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:24.750
all you people out there fucking torture and everyone with the along as

41
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.550
ceremonies,
you know,
like,
yeah,
the King and Queen of uh,

42
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.990
one of those stupid countries with the pasty people over there in Europe.

43
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.970
Who else has a king and Queen Leftover in Europe?
Is it like England?

44
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.260
They like the Wrigley Field of governments over there.
Right?

45
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.880
And they got these fucking jerk offs who just won't stop fucking each other

46
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:48.740
because they got the same kind of bloodline.

47
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.850
So then all of them sort of in a roundabout way,

48
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.150
looked like the English version of Eli and Peyton manning.
You know,

49
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.220
that's the deal dude.
Like when when you,
okay,

50
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.520
or at least when you go to procreate,
you got to get outside your circle,

51
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.040
get you got to run a post pattern,
get off your block.
You know what I mean?

52
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.820
He can't start banging the girl next door.
She's right there.

53
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.570
She smelled your toast and all the shit you are eating.
I'm telling you,

54
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.670
you're going to get like a fuck.
I don't know if you got to give him a hosts,

55
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.050
weird kids
who never wants to leave the town.
Right.

56
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.220
Molly dreams about his driving a fucking truck to plow the snow.

57
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.300
You know,
it was a big thing when I was in Massachusetts,
you know,

58
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.720
getting a fucking state job.
All those guys,
you know,

59
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:39.721
it is fucked up and angry and on edge and is racist is Massachusetts is people

60
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.140
always goes,
why are they liberal?
Why do they still vote Democrat?

61
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.460
It's because the amount of people there that want to get a state job so they can

62
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:52.090
lean on a fucking shovel,
a drive,
one of those orange pickup trucks,

63
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:56.510
like a half a mile an hour in the breakdown lane
Dillard,

64
00:03:56.511 --> 00:04:00.940
you drive in to fast,
fucking slow it down.
This is supposed to take all day.

65
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.650
I knew a guy a long time ago,
I worked in a warehouse and he had,

66
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.970
he quit the postal service because he was bored out of his mind.

67
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.900
He was a young kid and he knew somebody and he got in with the post,
uh,

68
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.630
working for the post office and he went out and he did his route and he got,

69
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.300
he was done with it by 11,
and the old timers go,

70
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.910
what the fuck are you doing here?
Get out of here.

71
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.510
Don't come back till four o'clock.
You're going to fuck this whole thing up.

72
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.080
So he went out and he like went to the movies and got like a sandwich and came

73
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:32.440
back and he just,
because he was raised right,

74
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.890
he couldn't live a life like that right now.
You know what?
I love it,

75
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:40.420
says possibly somebody who works one of those jobs listening right now.

76
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.200
And I want to,
I want to ask you,
how do you live with yourself?

77
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.010
How do you get up every morning and take an eight hours to do a fucking two hour

78
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.680
job?
How do you do that shit?
You know what I mean?

79
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.870
Do you really feel like you're getting any,

80
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.850
like you're getting away with something?
I mean,

81
00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:01.120
that would be just be torture.
Just imagine like whatever.

82
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.810
Just make anything take four times longer than it should,

83
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.280
right?
Cooking yourself an egg in the morning,

84
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.280
cooking it on low and just sitting there fucking random thing being ready in

85
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.910
like three minutes,
12 minutes later there's a fucking fried egg.

86
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.030
It's the worst example ever.
But you know what?
I made step on the gas pedal.

87
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:29.410
You piece of shit.
Um,
no,
it's awful.
I'm so pro union,

88
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:32.560
it's ridiculous.
But I feel like so many of the unions literally became,

89
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:34.990
what the fuck they were fighting and then they just became assholes.

90
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:37.930
And then the corporations who are like,
well,
you know,
fuck you.

91
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:42.310
Then keep your union and we'll take the factory.
We will move it elsewhere.
Oh,

92
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:47.290
look at this.
It's a third world country.
Are there any laws even down here?

93
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:51.640
Fuck it.
We'll go back to plain people the way we did before the triangle.

94
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:55.780
Shirtwaist fire there.
Look at me.
Oh,
who took a double deck?

95
00:05:55.781 --> 00:06:00.540
A tour bus in fucking new.
I did this guy.
All right.

96
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.620
What did I just fucking lean back too far on the chair and I disconnected it.

97
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:05.510
You know what?
We,
you know what?
This is a brand new studio,

98
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.890
so we're going to have some glitches.

99
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.500
<v 1>There was a clash batch.
Just boom.
Um,</v>

100
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.740
<v 0>anyway,
so they just fucking,</v>

101
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.040
people were making shirts and when you made shirts back then you had a,

102
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.870
you had a little bit of waste yet.
Shirtwaist
long story short,

103
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.690
somebody throw a fucking cigarette in there.
I don't know what happened.

104
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.660
They didn't have any fire escapes in the God damn doors.
We'll lock that.

105
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:30.290
Everybody had to like basically jump to their fucking deaths.
And a,

106
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:34.460
that was the reference.
It's not a very funny reference,
but it is a reference.

107
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.740
Um,
speaking of what should you guys see that,
uh,
that virgin,
uh,

108
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.820
airplane that goes out into space crashed fucking terrifying.

109
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.821
Is that through the God damn the balls to be a test pilot to go up the eye.

110
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.070
We designed this thing now on paper this thing should work and then you have to

111
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:01.790
go up there.
It basically see if it works.

112
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.390
And then once it works you have to start seeing what,
how big the,
the,

113
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.670
the fucking what the envelope within this thing can perform performing,

114
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.660
which basically involves what they,
what the,
you know,

115
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:17.390
the whole pushing the envelope.
Like whatever.

116
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:21.140
Just say you flew a helicopter and I said you can't go beyond 102 knots or else

117
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:24.290
she'd get fucking uh,
retreating blade stall.

118
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.270
Like how do you learn how to do that?

119
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.160
That means some mother fucker has to go 103 nights,
104 cause you know,

120
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.780
when they say it's 102,
you know,
they,
they still stop it way before,

121
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.190
but it means somebody had to have the balls to just keep pushing that stick

122
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:44.840
forward.
I mean,

123
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.841
what the what they think standup comics of fucking psychos to be a test pilot.

124
00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:51.654
I mean,

125
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.580
then you know what's the worst thing about that is what excites you after that?

126
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:56.990
Once you're on the fucking ground.

127
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.740
<v 1>Oh honey,
I'm so happy you're home.
Look what I did.</v>

128
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.670
I rearranged the furniture here.
This is great.

129
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.430
It just like opens up the road,
don't you think?

130
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:10.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

131
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.800
<v 1>Why don't you just stare at me like that when I say thanks.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.</v>

132
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.260
I'm not 30,000 feet off the fucking ground.

133
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.920
Go down here holding down the fort for you.

134
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.960
Well,
you're coming from,
Huh?

135
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.140
Did you get another blow job after one of your test flights

136
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.300
<v 0>and what does he do?
He just stares at it,
right?</v>

137
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:35.750
Maybe starts laughing like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas

138
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.930
and it fucking lap.

139
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.160
So he's wiping his eye and he goes back out to a rocket ship with Joe Pesci at

140
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.480
fuck kind of people a day.

141
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.080
That's your life and you can't relate to anybody anymore.

142
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.600
That's the deal.
Everybody's looking at you like,
what's your fucking problem?

143
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.300
It's like,
what's my fucking problem?
I've,
I've been like,
uh,

144
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.730
I went to the moon.
That's my problem.
Now I'm talking to you who,
uh,
you know,

145
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.780
went to the Patriots Broncos game and you've got your fucking eyebrows up.

146
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:10.440
Like what you just did was exciting and I'm sorry I'm having a little difficult,

147
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.460
a little difficult time relating to you right now.
You know,

148
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.920
you know,
his wife has given him shit.

149
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:20.340
You have to start bringing up the fact that you've been to space.

150
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.760
You know that you test pilots,
test pilots,
you test airplanes anyways,
so,

151
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.140
um,
so they got this plane that goes up into space.
I mean,

152
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.690
and it just kind of go try this fucking thing out the balls of those guys.

153
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.210
Unfortunately it didn't fucking work out.
Dude is no fucking way.

154
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.630
Do you realize the amount of fucking jackass is

155
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.130
slash former members of boy bands that are just lining up to pay 200 grand to be

156
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:51.930
the first fucking jerk off,

157
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.210
absolute fucking jerk off to get on one of those things.
See,
okay.

158
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.090
If he,
if he got 200 grand to do it,
keep it in your pocket.
All right.

159
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.650
Let other people be the test pilot passengers for this fucking thing.

160
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.750
You don't do that.
It's like,
oh,
it's like when,
when like,

161
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.340
like a new fucking iPhone comes out when,

162
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.090
when they came up with that lasik eye surgery,
you know,

163
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.510
and people were getting blinded and they will fucking it up cause it was new.

164
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.210
You don't fuck with new technology is all I'm saying.

165
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:31.710
Fucking idiots.
I want to go up and space.
You're nuts.

166
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.800
You're nuts.
What would you,
you know what I actually got to think here.

167
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.500
What would I rather do?
What would you rather do?

168
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:41.790
Would you rather risk your life going into space or go scuba diving?

169
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.540
To me,
those are the two big,

170
00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:48.810
the two probably most terrifying things I've ever seen in my life.
Oh yeah.

171
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.480
I gotta tell you this weekend,
I fucking,
uh,
when I went to that wedding,

172
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.780
there was a,
I was out in palm desert and um,

173
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.780
state this really cool hotel that had this,
um,

174
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.680
this basically lounge act.
And I don't want to disrespect the person,

175
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:08.790
but it was a lounge and he was doing his act right.
And,
uh,
you know,

176
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:11.880
older guys like in his sixties or whatever and he was singing the shit out of

177
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:16.470
these Frank Sinatra songs.
He was great,
really was great.
And um,

178
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.730
and it was fun watching the older people watch the guy cause in the end he had

179
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:21.241
all this whole,

180
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:24.900
this whole patriotic thing that he did like a salute to the troops except it was

181
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.710
real.
You know what I mean?
It's just a different time.

182
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.000
Like these guys are like a,
well wait a minute.

183
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.960
He was born in 1949 I think I looked him up.

184
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.310
So he would have been 20 in 1969.
I'll fuck that.

185
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.930
He's probably the Woodstock generation.

186
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.620
Anytime I see old people like saluting the flag,

187
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:48.430
I just think they fought in World War II.

188
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.750
I think I watched too many episodes of that.
Ken Burns the war,
but whatever.

189
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.890
It was a nice thing.
And uh,

190
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:56.530
the veterans in the crowd stood up a bunch of old guys and all that.

191
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.920
It was a really nice thing.
But in between,
he was telling these,
uh,
um,

192
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.240
he was a hundred percent Sicilian and he was telling these fucking old old,

193
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.650
old school jokes that of course would bomb in a comedy club within the context

194
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:11.740
of what he was doing.
They were great.
And uh,
one of the things he said,
he said,

195
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:16.210
uh,
you know,
I'm a hundred percent Sicilian.
My,
uh,

196
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.440
my birthstone is cement or something like that,
which obviously,
you know,

197
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:24.130
fucking high old time joke,
but it just reminded me

198
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.380
of a,
one of the worst deaths.
I've actually thought about this.

199
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:33.760
Like if somebody ever,
uh,
you know,

200
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:37.840
one of the take you out and you're standing on a fucking boat in cement that's

201
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.380
drying and it's at night and it taken you out into the ocean and they're just

202
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:45.580
going to toss you fucking overboard.
I would be just standing there weeping,

203
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:48.070
just going,
just showed me just fuck.
Yeah,
they,
but guy,

204
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:51.730
we can't man the blood splatter.
We've got to get caught.
Well,

205
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.010
can you fucking shoot me?
It should throw me it.

206
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.570
Just give me a gun,
right as you throw me in,
I'm going to pull the trigger.

207
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:05.920
Is that all right?
I'll count to 1000 now already be in the water and won't work.

208
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.280
Like what happens is that or any medical person out there,
is it a quick death?

209
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.890
I just can't imagine what you fucking going down waiting for your God damn head

210
00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:20.890
to explode

211
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.170
and then you'd want it like somehow like just take a big gulp of water to end it

212
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.850
and uh,
you couldn't,
your body wouldn't let you fuck it.
Oh my God.
You're like,

213
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:35.851
just kills me about that is you just keep going down and down and down and down,

214
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:43.390
way past where all the fucking submarines,
anybody's ever fucking God.

215
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:44.680
You just,
you're going to keep going.

216
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.950
Now granted the pressure is going to fucking kv in at some point,

217
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.220
right?
Just at the fucking way to that water.

218
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.510
You know,

219
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.480
it'd be worse if your survival instinct kicked in and you kept clearing your

220
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:04.360
ears as you went down for as long as you fucking could.
You just

221
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.793
look

222
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.660
like just some futile attempt to just survive.

223
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:16.570
You keep clear in the fucking air out of your Eustachian tubes,
you know,

224
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:20.860
see a fucking ear.
Drums don't explode.
Oh Christ.

225
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.780
What a fucking way to go.

226
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:27.010
And that's all I actually zoned out as he was singing.

227
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.150
<v 1>What is a man?
What has he got?</v>

228
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.950
Damn Dad himself.
Then he is shot,

229
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.410
<v 0>right?
I just kept it the whole time he was singing then</v>

230
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.520
<v 1>to speak.
The Wo de truly feels</v>

231
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:42.870
<v 0>right.</v>

232
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.870
I was just picturing going down to the bottom of the ocean in cement shoes.

233
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.470
<v 1>They're not the words of what,
who did hills.
It was like this little Goodfellow.</v>

234
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.350
<v 0>Philip Philip was going on in my head.</v>

235
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.840
Make granted I was a couple of scotches in,
Oh,
you know what?
So,

236
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:00.674
um,

237
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.450
it was a buddy of mine who got married and I was supposed to get him some sick

238
00:15:03.451 --> 00:15:06.770
guys.
And I've been so busy with my day job,

239
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.790
I'm writing on the a or it's sitting in the room pitching jokes on the soon to

240
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:17.921
be hit animated show in December of 2015 f is for family.

241
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.400
I'm going to hype this fucking show.

242
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.660
I'm going to hype this fucking show for a year.
So you guys better get,

243
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.760
you've got to get ready.
You know what I'm literally doing?

244
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:27.900
Like when they said this,
you know,

245
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.560
when they hyped it and when it's actually coming out and it's like how long it

246
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:35.561
takes for a guy in the mass pike to drive to a pothole fucking a mile away.

247
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.210
Um,
anyway,
so I didn't have time to get the cigars right,

248
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:45.530
so I got to hook up out here to get the old fucking,
uh,
Cubanos there.

249
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.990
And um,
anyways,
this,
uh,
I didn't do it.

250
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:52.400
So I go out to palm desert and I'm like,
all right,

251
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:56.030
there's all these old fucking staunch Republicans out here.

252
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.680
They all got money.
They all like playing golf.
They like smoking.

253
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:02.600
Fucking sick guys.
I know they got Cuban cigars,

254
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.580
so I just don't go to a smoke shop.

255
00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:07.550
I look for a high end fucking place that actually has a little bit of a lounge

256
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:11.810
thing,
right?
You know,
fucking wooden Indian outside and Shit,
you know,

257
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:13.610
all the old school stuff.
So I find one right?

258
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.470
And I walk in there and I'm just like,
hey man,
it's uh,
it's my buddies,
you know,

259
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.180
uh,
he got married today.
I'm in between the,

260
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.340
actually the wedding ceremony in the after party.
I was supposed to get scars.

261
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:28.070
I fucked up.
Can you help me out?
He goes,
yeah,
sure.
Come on in the human door.

262
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.300
So I say to the guy,
hey,
you got any,
you know,
he got me a lot of crystal or uh,

263
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.950
you know,
party is any,
any fucking,
you know,
basically.
And he goes,
I go,

264
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.250
you got some Cubans?
He goes,
well,
I got these over here and I go,

265
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:43.460
you got any Cuban cigars?
And he goes,
killed.
It's set.

266
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.610
Guards are illegal in the United States of America.

267
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.540
Just wanted to fucking slap him in the face with a book of matches out.
Really?

268
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.500
Thank you.
Like,

269
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:58.670
I don't fucking know that Jesus fucking Christ.

270
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.030
Well,
maybe cause I looked like a cop.
He said it and we went to

271
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.150
had our land is not legal.
What's led they get,
I know it isn't.

272
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.290
I'd still like some,

273
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.320
I'm asking you to do an illegal transaction here.
I have cash,

274
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:17.000
I'm willing to,
I've never fucking been,
and you know,

275
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.540
every place they go to out here,
you just fuck it.
Ask Him.

276
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.810
They have him in the back.

277
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.350
And this is what's funny is people say they say this shit right?
They'll go,
uh,

278
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.940
you know,
actually,
oh,
like 99.99,

279
00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:33.941
nine to 99% of the fucking Cuban cigars in this country are fake.

280
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.983
And you know what?

281
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:41.190
They are wrong because I've been outside this country and I smoked them and they

282
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:45.560
taste the exact same.
And then they're gonna say,
well,
you know,
once Castro,

283
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.810
fucking Bluebell,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

284
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:49.980
all those companies fucking moved out of Cuba.

285
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.220
Go Fuck yourself with your theories.

286
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.630
You read an article on one of those websites that have lists.

287
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.770
I don't give a shit.
All I know is that the Cuban cigar that I smoked in Paris,

288
00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:05.370
France tastes the same as the one out here.
Okay?
So whatever it is,

289
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.940
and that thing tastes way better than all of the fucking legal ones.

290
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:13.830
All those other ones that they say,
oh,
this Davidoff fucking Nicaraguan,
you know,

291
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.540
tastes better.
Don't tested higher than the Cuba ones.
Go Fuck Yourself.

292
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.861
Go Fuck Yourself.

293
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:22.770
You're still comparing them to compete Cuban cigars and there's a reason for it.

294
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:26.760
It's just like how every fucking car compares itself to something German or

295
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:31.290
Italian or whatever.
Right?
This is like a Ferrari except it's only 40 grand.

296
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.280
You know,
by the way,
I,
uh,

297
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.590
I'm gonna talk cars here for a second.
I got to
where I got to do here.

298
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.020

Something.
Something,
something.

328
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:35.130
And your balls are a saint.
Oh,
go get yourself some fucking me undies.

329
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.700
Why do I have to read the copy?
I don't know.
All right,
here we go.

330
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.850
All right,
90%.

331
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.260
That's the percent of your life that you're in your underwear and your
underwear.

332
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:49.720
It gets old,
fast,
gross and always gets gross.

333
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.150
It's unbelievable how putting on a great pair of underwear,

334
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:55.940
it changes your entire outlook for that day.
That's not a joke.
Uh,

335
00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.250
you know that feeling of putting on that ratty old saggy underwear.

336
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.460
I want you to know the feeling of wearing great fitting underwear.

337
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:07.810
Great looking underwear.
Underwear that cares about your balls.

338
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.560
All right?
You need to know about me undies.
Dotcom.

339
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.530
Me undies has the most comfortable underwear you have ever tried on.

340
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.900
They fit perfectly.
They don't ride up on you.

341
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.710
They literally pull moisture away from your skin.
Gross.

342
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.980
Uh,
so you're cool all day long.

343
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.190
Who has sweaty balls?
Who is sweaty balls that isn't walking around working out?

344
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.000
You know,

345
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.090
I think a lot of guys have sweaty balls and I think me undies is filling a void

346
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:37.720
here.
So if you're one of those sweaty ball guys,
here's the rest of the copy.

347
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.200
Here's what I love me undies is environmentally friendly.

348
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.880
Well doesn't that depend on what you eat?
You know,

349
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:47.530
because once you put your skid marks in there,

350
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:50.350
if you're fucking eat a bunch of processed food,
you know,

351
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.320
it's like when you put rat poison down,
right?

352
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:57.130
The rat eats sitting in the coyote eats the rat and in the mountain lion eats

353
00:21:57.131 --> 00:22:00.820
the fucking coyote and they all die the same poison.
Is it bill?

354
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.430
I don't think it is.
All right.
The materials they use are sustainably source,

355
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.511
not shit.
Sorry,

356
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:12.060
I touch the screen that's sustainably sourced from the Austrian Alps and they

357
00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:13.270
are completely natural.

358
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.100
They also use a CO2 neutral process with a low carbon footprint.

359
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.930
They save water and energy due to their spun dried fiber process.

360
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.140
You know what?
I might have to try these fucking things.
I got to get a pair.

361
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.710
They have cool styles for both men and women and they all look great.

362
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.370
Check out the photos yourself,
me,
undies,
me undies.

363
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.980
Go get a fucking pair of me undies.
Dotcom.

364
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.760
This quality would typically retail for two times the me undies price.

365
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.500
No retail middlemen means more savings for you.
Here,
I'll make it easy.

366
00:22:44.501 --> 00:22:48.550
Go to [inaudible] dot com slash [inaudible] and get 20% off your first order and

367
00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:51.640
free shipping.
Save even more.
When you buy a pack of them,

368
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:56.260
they guarantee you that you're going to be happy with them or your first pair is

369
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:58.840
free.
If you're not happy with them,

370
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:01.810
they'll come over there and they'll wipe the residual moisture off he and nuts

371
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.420
because that's the only way you can't be happy with these.

372
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:06.850
They're actually sending me some sweatpants this week.
I can't wait.

373
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.880
I'm going to try them on and I'm going to tell you about him next week cause I'm

374

a whore.

sorry.

381
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:34.110
Getting your mail and shipping done can seem like a no win situation situation.

382
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.780
Uh,
going to the post office takes up valuable time.

383
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.100
Leasing a postage meter is expensive with multiyear commitments and hidden fees.

384
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:45.650
Who the hell wants that?
Luckily all freckles here knows better way.

385

Go to stamps.com with stamps.com buy and print official US postage for any

388
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:02.750
The post office plus stamps.com is more powerful than a postage meter at just a

389
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:03.710
fraction of the cost.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.180
You can save up to 80% compared to a postage meter and you will avoid those time

399

enter burr.
All right.
All right,

400
00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:42.950
let's talk cause um,

401
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.100
so I've been threatening then I was going to buy a new car.

402
00:24:47.101 --> 00:24:49.740
The old Prius is getting old.
The old fucking Prius.

403
00:24:49.741 --> 00:24:53.850
She ain't what she used to be.
Actually,
to be honest with you,

404
00:24:53.851 --> 00:24:58.090
only need to do is get a little interior work done just fresh in her up.

405
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.170
But uh,
you know,
there's a couple of cars out there.
They got my eye on,

406
00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:03.930
one of them was a Mercedes Benz and,
um,

407
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.100
AMG fucking psycho level car,
right?
And a,

408
00:25:08.101 --> 00:25:12.060
the other day yesterday I saw one on the highway.
Is this ever happened to you?

409
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.490
You see your fucking dream car,
you see the car you want to,

410
00:25:14.491 --> 00:25:15.540
when they need drive up and you're like,

411
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:19.110
I just got to see what the person looks like that's driving it.

412
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.650
I bet they look like an astronaut fucking test pilot of some shit.
Right?

413
00:25:22.651 --> 00:25:25.450
A war hero.
I do it.
I pulled up along this car.

414
00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:28.410
This guy could not have looked like more of a fucking dirt bag.

415
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.100
He's like in his twenties,
you know,

416
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.430
he just looked like a fucking,
I can't even,

417
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.830
I can't explain it because I'll get in trouble,
you know,
and not,

418
00:25:40.831 --> 00:25:44.070
not really by the fucking politically correct police.
Just by,
you know,

419
00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:48.690
this nationality of people like the,
they like if pitbulls became human beings,

420
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.210
um,
he just looked like a fuck.
Like I,

421
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.340
if I haven't had a daughter and this guy showed up at the door

422
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.780
to date her,
I don't know what I would do.

423
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.250
I would do something fucking crazy and then I would start weeping afterwards.

424
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:07.590
He just looked like the biggest piece of shit ever.
And that was just like,

425
00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:10.350
am I a piece of shit?
Well,
I am a piece of shit,

426
00:26:10.351 --> 00:26:13.770
but am I that kind of a piece of shit?
Is that what I'm going to look like?

427
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.890
But then if I get the car,
other people would be,
oh,
that's my dream car.

428
00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:19.710
And they're gonna pull up alongside and see fucking Ron Howard driving the thing

429
00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:20.700
that's going to ruin it for,

430
00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.660
I think Mercedes Benz Oughta pay me not to buy one of their cars

431
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.100
or at least give a free tinted window package to me.

432
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:34.650
So it doesn't fucking hurt.
They're hurt their product.
Um,

433
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.690
I dunno,
but I'm going to get one this and this what I'm doing,

434
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:40.220
I'm waiting right now.

435
00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:43.410
I can get the car but I have to wait till the downstairs is done in my house.

436
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.740
You know,
cause that is a bad fucking move.

437
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.500
You don't want to go out and buy a new car and when people are doing work on

438
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:50.370
your house,
cause they'll just,

439
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.340
they'll just think like okay this guy isn't spreading themselves too thin.

440
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.040
This guy is just bottomless.
All right.
It's not fucking true.
I mean you get,

441
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.210
you can get yourself in any car for like 1500 bucks.

442
00:27:00.211 --> 00:27:03.750
Now sign a god Damn Lisa on the thing.
They don't give a shit.

443
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.530
They give you fucking eight miles a month.
Your,
it's good.
Right?
You drive home,

444
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:09.990
you're already over the miles.
Any,
any fucking jerk.

445
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.080
That's the thing now about cars.
Back in the day when you had to buy him,

446
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.730
you actually had to be able to afford them.

447
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:17.670
So if somebody came down the street and a Cadillac or a Mercedes or something

448
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:19.020
like that,
you could look at that man.

449
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.960
And it was a man cause those bitches stayed home back then.
Right.

450
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.050
It was a fucking man.
And you could look at and hold your head high and go,

451
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.280
I wonder who the fuck he robbed to get that Goddamn car?
What did he do?

452
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.900
You know,
that's the great thing about being an entertainer is people,
you know,

453
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.520
you gotta admit,
you know,
entertainers.
We earned our money.

454
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.630
We started out in the fucking lounges.
You know,
I'm,

455
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.870
I'm totally doing this,
lobbing it over the net.

456
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:51.000
So you fucking cunts out there can actually rip me apart and say that I don't

457
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:54.930
deserve it.
Um,
no,
I think I'm,
uh,

458
00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.120
I just gotta get through this fucking built once they just finish this fucking

459
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:03.510
thing,
it's almost done.
People,
they're literally,
they put in the hardwood floors.

460
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:04.831
Okay,

461
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:09.831
I have floors downstairs now they're putting the tile in and the fucking laundry

462
00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:13.820
room that's going to be done.
Everything's going to fucking make sense.

463
00:28:13.821 --> 00:28:17.820
Do you know my fucking Washer and dryer were in a closet off of my kitchen?

464
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.860
Does that make any fucking sense?

465
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.210
Put them downstairs now we turned the laundry room upstairs into a walk in

466
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:29.070
pantry.
All right.
So I can resell it Sunday because I,

467
00:28:29.071 --> 00:28:30.240
one thing I've learned about women,

468
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.200
they like being able to walk into something where they can put a bunch of Shit,

469
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.420
you know,
they don't want a closet.
They want to walk into the closet.
Oh my God,

470
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:42.810
look at them.
I can walk in and put all my stuff here.

471
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.450
They're in the kitchen.
They liked the kitchen.

472
00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:47.370
But if they can walk into a Pantry,

473
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.050
I could put the flower over here and a mixed the room for there.

474
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.850
I can walk into it.
That's what you want to do.
Like if I was still a single man,

475
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.660
I would build like some sort of walk in closet,
like a mini one,

476
00:29:00.661 --> 00:29:04.770
like leading to my Dick.
Right.
And then you just go out to the,

477
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.080
actually it didn't Justin Timberlake through that,
he put his,

478
00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:12.060
put his dick in a box.
You know,
not every idea is going to be original.

479
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.790
Um,
anyways,
so I can I,

480
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:17.700
can I give you guys a little bit of promotion here at the all things comedy

481
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:21.900
network?
That was a eight.
It's a podcast network that I,
um,

482
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.160
I started with a Al Madrigal and a couple other fellers and,

483
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:30.510
um,
it's basically a,
you know,

484
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.680
it's basically owned and operated by standup comics.

485
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:37.710
And we don't own anybody's podcast and we don't try to fuck anybody out of
money.

486
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.890
All right?
But things,
things do cost money.
So we're having this here.

487
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.570
All things comedy,

Jackie to Shane.

Al Madrigal and Philippe Esperanza.
Uh,

496
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:24.970
you got to listen to him.
Did I say his name right?
Esparza?
I'm the fucking worst.

497
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.730
Um,
and you know,

498
00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.190
in such a fucking crime that I didn't say his name correctly cause he had the

499
00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:33.190
best goddamn stories.
I've ever heard.
You've got to listen to it.
Um,

500
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.290
such a white guy from the fucking east coast.
I anything remotely Latino,

501
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.820
I can't even pronounce it.
Um,

502
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.350
that's embarrassing of listen to all just fucking call me too.

503
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.410
What a piece of shit I am.
Anyways.
Check it out.
It's going to be on iTunes.

504
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.340
I'm all right.
Let's get back to the podcast.
Can we talk a little football?
What,

505
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.090
what did the Buddha,
um,
yeah,

506
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:57.040
I'm not going to brag about the Patriots beating the Broncos.

507
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.810
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not going to act like,
you know,

508
00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:02.740
Tom Brady is better than fucking eat.
Uh,

509
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.750
Peyton manning.
I'm not going to do that shit.
I'm not going to do that.
All right.

510
00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.160
I don't,
I,
you know,
the record speaks for itself.
Had the head matchups.

511
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.630
I hate when people do that.
Well,
you know,

512
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:15.910
at least seven and two against the lifetime.
Well,

513
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:20.290
I guess that means he's a better quarterback.
I think it all comes down to a,

514
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:23.920
you know,
when you had your opportunities,
what did you do with them?
All right.

515
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.200
That's basically what it is,
because everything else is,

516
00:31:26.201 --> 00:31:29.290
you've got everybody else on the fucking field.
You know,

517
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.870
people always come up with a reason to blame it on the biggest guy.

518
00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:35.650
And I don't think that's necessarily fair.
All right.
Although that picked six,

519
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:39.340
he threw against the saints was his fault.
I'll give him shit on that when Ann,

520
00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:44.170
but I also think Brady should have hit Wes Welker guy was fucking wide open.

521
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:46.550
He through to the back shoulder.
Welker OCI should've caught it.

522
00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:50.050
It's a fucking shame.
And then what happened?
Next thing you know,
Eli,

523
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.290
the fucking middle child ends up with more rings than Peyton figure that one
out,

524
00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.500
you know.

525
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.520
But the thing about Eli that you got to love about that guy is as much as he

526
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:08.080
looks like he always has a cold,
the bigger the game,
the better he plays.

527
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:11.140
So I fucking love that guy.
Despite the fact he gives team kicked.

528
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:14.380
My team's asked twice in the Superbowl.
But you know what,

529
00:32:14.381 --> 00:32:16.790
when you've won three others,
I guess those locally,
you know,

530
00:32:16.791 --> 00:32:20.440
I realize that the Patriots are actually have been in,
um,

531
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.260
I think more super bowls.
How many we've been in,
let's see,

532
00:32:26.261 --> 00:32:29.020
we lost to the bears.
We lost to the packers who beat the rams.

533
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.880
We beat the panthers.
You'd beat the eagles.
We also the giants Watson,
the giants.

534
00:32:34.881 --> 00:32:37.900
That's seven.
A record is three and four.

535
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:43.850
I think the cowboys had been in the most super bowls.
What's their deal?

536
00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.570
They lost to the colts.
Then they beat Miami.

537
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.290
Right.
So those were two
in Miami.

538
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:59.291
Beat the Redskins and then steelies beat the cowboys and the cowboys beat the

539
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:03.020
Broncos and Steelers beat the cowboys.
So that's five.

540
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.060
They'd been an eight.

541
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.220
And then they'd beat the bills twice and then they'd beat the Steelers.

542
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.120
So they've been an eight pages of Ns seven Superbowls.

543
00:33:14.121 --> 00:33:17.960
How the fuck did that happen?
The goddamn door mats to the league.

544
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.270
I'm playing in that high school football stadium.
Unbelievable.
But,
um,
yeah,

545
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:27.860
I'm not going to brag about shit.
Um,
you know,
we also let up 21 points.

546
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:31.280
We still suck against the run and it's also a regular season game and all that

547
00:33:31.281 --> 00:33:34.370
type of shit.
So I,
like I said,
I'm not going to really fucking brag about that.

548
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.530
Um,
um,
I am happy that we won and all that type of shit.
Uh,

549
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.920
but I gotta be honest with you,
I have no idea who the best team is right now.

550
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:48.230
Um,
I mean,
cause somebody explained to me the San Diego chargers,

551
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.070
what the fuck is that?
Like if you bet on football this year,

552
00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:53.420
you're out of your mind at this point,

553
00:33:53.421 --> 00:33:58.421
you should just cut your losses and go home 37 and nothing against the dolphins,

554
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.640
you know.
No,
no disrespect to the dolphins,
but the fucking dolphins,

555
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:08.120
37 and nothing.
I missed the whole game,
so I should just shut the hell up.

556
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:12.030
I was at that stupid,
not stupid event.
I was doing that event thing,
um,

557
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.890
as a sports fan in me saying that it was stupid,
um,
bored ever.

558
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:19.460
So I haven't,
I have no idea.
I don't know.
I don't know who shot.

559
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:23.060
I don't know who's not.
I don't know who's good.
I really don't.
And um,

560
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.100
but the Patriots,
look how the Patriots look every year to me,
um,

561
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:32.000
since we stopped a winning Superbowls.
So,

562
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.300
you know,
I think we're,
once again,

563
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.140
I love that that were somehow number one against the past.

564
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.980
That's great.
But,
uh,
I dunno,

565
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.000
it'd be nice if we could have been at least seventh against the run as opposed

566
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:49.100
to like dead last.
I'm quoting somebody from last week.

567
00:34:49.101 --> 00:34:53.490
I might be wrong about that,
but uh,
you know,
so whatever.
I hope,
I hope,
um,

568
00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.760
you know,
whatever.
I know we're gonna make the play offs obviously.

569
00:34:58.761 --> 00:35:03.350
Cause I division fucking stinks.
And uh,
I don't know what about that.

570
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:06.560
Jet's Jesus fucking Christ one in eight.

571
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.820
Thank God for their ads.
Are they,
they'd have the worst team in the league.

572
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.870
Unbelievable.
That's how you,
right now,
you know,

573
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:17.900
he's going to be a fucking bargain to pick up his rex Ryan when they fire that

574
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:21.080
guy because that guy is a good coach.
I don't like that.
He talks shit,

575
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.410
disrespects other fucking teams and he does.

576
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.910
And it comes from a place of insecurity,
I think.
And then he tried.
Yeah.

577
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.240
<v 1>No,
you can't get mad at me.</v>

578
00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.970
<v 0>Shut the fuck up.
You ran your mouth when you had a good team.</v>

579
00:35:33.971 --> 00:35:36.610
Now your team stinks.
Now you're now,
you're now you're not talking.

580
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.300
So maybe he is a good guy.
Maybe he did learn his lesson.

581
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:41.820
I'm going to wait for rex Ryan to have another good team and if he doesn't talk

582
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:45.390
shit,
then I'll be like,
all right.
He kind of learned a lesson then.

583
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.480
But I think most of the reason why he's kept his mouth shut is because his team

584
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:52.860
has stunk.
However,
um,
I will say this,
um,

585
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.350
that that team is not his fault.
Uh,
they,
uh,

586
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.720
you got to get rid of that GM,
you know,

587
00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.960
coach is only as good as the play is.

588
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.990
I sound like one of those stupid analysts on fucking ESPN.
But it's true.
The Guy,

589
00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:11.991
he doesn't have anybody in Geno Smith from what I heard was the debt gms.

590
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:17.070
That was his big fucking pick.
You know,
what are you supposed to do?
So,
uh,

591
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:19.260
whatever.
So he's going to get blamed,
he's going to get fired,

592
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:21.930
the jams going to get fired and then someone's going to pick up rex Ryan and I'm

593
00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:24.630
thinking,
you know,
if he gets,
if he gets with the right GM,

594
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.380
I think you know that guy took the jets to like within two plays

595
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.200
a or one drive I should say of getting to the Superbowl,
the fucking jets.

596
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.280
That's an accomplishment in itself,
you know.
So

597
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.810
I dunno,
it's weird.
I used to,

598
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.180
I remember for the longest time I used to wish I was switched to jets with lose

599
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:47.880
and I fucking hated rex rang cause he was talking all that shit and I wanted to

600
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:51.330
see the guy flame out exactly what the fuck's happening and now it's happening.

601
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.790
And I feel bad for the guy because I feel like a,

602
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.350
what's going on is not his fault.

603
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.180
I wanted them to lose with the fucking players that he picked cause he talked

604
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:02.920
all that fucking shit.
You know,
we're going to win a suit,

605
00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:05.610
blow with best fucking team and it's fucking league.

606
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.370
All of that Shit just drove me up the Goddamn wall.

607
00:37:08.371 --> 00:37:12.570
But now it's now it's how I can't root for a guy to lose his job.
Can I?

608
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.510
Yeah.
Jesus.
I Dunno.
Um,
anyways,
what a,
how much you,

609
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.940
how much time have I done here by the way,
Mike?
Well,
we started over,
didn't we?

610
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:24.080
Or with this is,
this is the real time.
37 minutes.
All right.

611
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:29.700
I'm 37 minutes in.
Uh,
all right,

612
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:33.720
what the fuck else am I going to talk about?
Oh,
I did a,

613
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:38.580
I did a benefit benefit,
uh,
uh,
for pit bulls last night.

614
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.370
It's one of my favorite benefits of the year cause I absolutely fucking love

615
00:37:41.371 --> 00:37:43.590
dogs.
And I also showed up and um,

616
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:49.150
there's all these pitfalls there that need to be adopted and stuff and uh,
uh,

617
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.950
they just,
uh,
the best,
the best fucking looking.
Like if you drew a dog's face,

618
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.940
that's what a pit bull,

619
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.380
you know what their face looks like that it's just a fucking dog.

620
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.500
So I went over there and there's all these poor dogs.

621
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:05.250
They had their fucking ears clipped and shit.
You know,

622
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:08.100
they went through all of this God damn pain and they just sit in there,
you know,

623
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.810
they're looking scary.
Cause if fucking ears are all cut up and shit,
I was so,

624
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:16.740
I go over to pet this one,
right?
Great fucking dog.

625
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:20.670
It's one of those dogs will you start petting it?
It like leads into you.

626
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.080
It puts all its weight on you.

627
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:25.920
And I wasn't prepared for that and I squatted down like a catcher to pet this

628
00:38:25.921 --> 00:38:30.720
thing and it just fucking leaned into me and actually knocked me over like a

629
00:38:30.721 --> 00:38:35.290
fucking asshole.
But uh,
ah,
it was crazy.
They had puppies there.

630
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.670
You know,
if my dog wasn't such a psycho and wouldn't try to fight another dog,

631
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:41.560
if I brought it in,
I would own three of them.

632
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.910
So I just got to ride it out with the crazy dog that I loved.

633
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:50.240
Now give me the best life possible.
Um,
but when a,

634
00:38:50.241 --> 00:38:55.210
that chapter is over,
I'm going to get a,
I'm going to get a blue nose,
a red nose.

635
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.350
I'm going to get an all white ones.
And I'm going to get a black one,

636
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.070
I'm going to have four of them.
And even then that won't be enough.

637
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.950
That's how much I fucking love that breed of dog.
So it was a,

638
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.820
it was a fucking great time going over there and not doing the show.
I actually,

639
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:13.420
I did two shows and the first show went great.
The second show,

640
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:16.840
I don't know what happened.
I think I went out and I went out too hard.

641
00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:21.160
There was a comic in the room that I wanted to impress a comic that I liked when

642
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:23.590
I was starting out and now he's still like,
I'm obviously,
but uh,

643
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.960
I tried to fucking,
I swear to God,

644
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.680
nothing will humble you like fucking standup comedy every time you think he got

645
00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:33.730
it down,
you know,
like,
ah,
I got this fucking figured out.

646
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.660
What ends up happening,
you know,
you go up there and yeah,
I didn't eat my balls,

647
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:41.740
but uh,
I definitely,
uh,
I,
my munched on them a little bit.

648
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:46.720
I swear to God,
I thought he said,

649
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.170
I thought he said it the same funny way I went up there and I said,

650
00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:55.000
you know what,
I just hope that when it's all said and done,

651
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:59.110
all the money we raise here tonight,
some of it trickles actually trickles down

652
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.610
to some,
to the dogs or something like that.
Cause you know,
all these,

653
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:07.480
half of these fucking,
these Goddamn uh,

654
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:13.860
charities are total scams just as far as like,

655
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:16.450
uh,
you know,

656
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:20.740
that the amount of money that goes towards whatever the hell they're trying to

657
00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:24.880
stop versus what they line their pockets with.
I mean,
it is a,
it's a scam.

658
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:27.040
Somebody sent me something where,
you know,

659
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:31.720
the amount of charities out there that,
that they name their charity.

660
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:35.770
That almost sounds like the legitimate charity,
you know,
like that,
um,

661
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.010
that coming to America instead of Mcdonald's,

662
00:40:39.011 --> 00:40:42.670
it's Mcdowell's they do that and these fucking pieces of shit.

663
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.530
We'll just put a picture of a starving kid or something like that.

664
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.400
And then you feel bad.
You dropped some change in,

665
00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:53.620
there were a couple of bucks and they just keep it and they go out and they get

666
00:40:53.621 --> 00:40:54.454
a house.

667
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:01.590
We had another glitch with some of the why is here the fuck was I talking about?

668
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:03.970
It'll get better people.

669
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.930
It'll get better if you get down there and get your all things comedy,

670
00:41:07.931 --> 00:41:12.520
$5 fundraiser stickers.
Um,
we even have a website,

671
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.920
Mike,
do we even have a website?

672
00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:17.110
Whether I'm supposed to tell these people to get these fucking stickers,

673
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:21.700
then to start all right there,

674
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:26.630
go to to start.com if you'd like,
they stop hearing delays in this podcast now,

675
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.450
whatever.
We'll figure it out.
Anyway,
so these constant,
they start,
they start a,

676
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.590
um,
a a,

677
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.440
what do you call a charity and they name it like another charity that's actually

678
00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:39.170
legitimate and they put some,
you know,

679
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:42.380
sad puppies face or a who the fuck knows what?

680
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.240
And then they make a bunch of money.
Next thing you know,

681
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:47.210
they've got a big house sitting by a pool and they don't feel one ounce of guilt

682
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.490
there.
Absolutely.
You know what,

683
00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:51.100
what happened to these people if they actually did something like that and let

684
00:41:51.101 --> 00:41:55.310
in Singapore,
you know,
where it's illegal to spit gum

685
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:57.770
on the sidewalk.

686
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:00.890
I can't imagine the caning that these people would get and they would fucking

687
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:04.630
deserve it too,
is horrific as a caning video is,
um,

688
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.070
I actually have a theory people,

689
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.980
oh Billy gossip has come in with the theory I've noticed this year.
Uh,

690
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.550
you know,
a lot of stuff came out about a certain campaign that a,

691
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.790
that was raising awareness that made everybody wear the,
uh,

692
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.670
well it's not quite a Magenta pink,
the pink campaign.

693
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:30.890
A lot of shit came out about that.
A lot of unsavory floating.

694
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:33.550
She had old woody about that campaign,

695
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.340
about how much money was being raised in how much was actually being

696
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:42.341
appropriated toward actually finding a fucking cure for breast cancer and how

697
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:47.561
much was going into a new tiling inside this person's fucking Olympic size pool.

698
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.690
And also a lot of shit came out about the NFL and they're pink jerseys.

699
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.250
And by a lot of shit.

700
00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:58.740
I mean the website I went to in the one article that I read,
um,

701
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.990
about it,
I thought it was a legitimate website.
I mean it was on the Internet,

702
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:05.180
right.
And they was saying that like,
you know,

703
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:09.140
like 95% of the profits from those jerseys went into the NFL pockets.

704
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.070
And I think that people were starting to blow whistles and,

705
00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:18.050
but the NFL makes so much fucking money for media giants,

706
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.160
Espn,

707
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.760
fucking Fox and NBC that they all kind of squashed it.

708
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:30.010
And I think that the pink lady and the NFL both made their money and this slowly

709
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:34.120
back it off each other and just going to pretend it never fucking happened

710
00:43:34.121 --> 00:43:36.710
because this year they went from,
Oh my God,

711
00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:40.900
if I see another fucking pink thing again in my life,
um,

712
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:46.100
I'm going to kill myself.
Last year you couldn't escape it.
I mean,

713
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:49.100
I remember when I was in New Orleans working and there was like a,

714
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.150
I went to this casino and the blackjack table I was two years ago,

715
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.350
the blackjack table was pink.
It was all fucking over the place.

716
00:43:57.351 --> 00:44:00.280
And now I noticed this year straight across the board,

717
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.800
the NFL and everywhere else,
way,
way,

718
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:08.120
way the fuck toned down,
way the fuck tone down.

719
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:13.010
And I think they're all slowly walking away from some unsavory shit.

720
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:15.200
They just acted like it never happened.
Hey,
you know,

721
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:19.520
whatever we should like that crimes and misdemeanors with somebody got killed,

722
00:44:19.521 --> 00:44:22.370
but nobody got caught.
And you just kind of get over it after a while.

723
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:26.540
He just get on with your fucking life.
I think if I had to guess a,

724
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.110
but then I'm a negative.
I'm not a negative prick.
I'm a cynical son of a bitch.

725
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:34.740
And uh,
I think that that's what happened
Sunday,

726
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:38.820
that Oprah will make a fucking movie about it.
Right.
The lifetime network.

727
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.790
Some will play the pink lady.
No,
Oprah wouldn't do that.
Right.
That's,

728
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.740
that would make women look bad.
She,
she's not about that.
If there's a guy,

729
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.000
you know what you just,

730
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.130
they say was based on real events and then somehow they would make the reason

731
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:58.020
why the evil woman at the head of the pink campaign did it was because some guy

732
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.680
was verbally abusing her or hit on her when she walked down the street.

733
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.880
There's a couple of none and not in another like non-stories in stand up comedy,

734
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.720
like the fucking outrage.
You know,
back when I was a kid,

735
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:14.160
when people got outraged,

736
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.370
what they did was when they wanted to find out if people were actually outraged,

737
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.980
they went out in the street and they talk to people.

738
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.090
Now it's like marketed outrage,
so I don't even buy into it.

739
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.003
You know what I mean?

740
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.710
Like a this comic fake,
they did this whole fucking thing.

741
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:35.880
This woman made a video.
She walked around New York City for 10 fucking hours.

742
00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.880
10 hours.
Yeah.

743
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.290
You fucking walk around in public for 10 hours is a good look.
A woman,

744
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:47.240
somebody is going to hit on you,
right?
I would.

745
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.550
They should follow me for 10 hours.
It'd be the exact opposite.

746
00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:51.900
Instead of people hitting on me,

747
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.093
<v 1>hi,</v>

748
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.910
<v 0>and then the end,
I get mugged.
Jesus Christ,</v>

749
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:04.680
bunch of fucking cry babies now.

750
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:08.070
You know what I love all the fucking clothes she was wearing were made in a

751
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:11.220
sweatshop somewhere.
So as much as she's having a fucking problem,

752
00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:13.610
people calling out how nicer asses?

753
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.490
There's some crying child that made those jeans that are so wonderfully cupping

754
00:46:17.491 --> 00:46:21.570
her booty cheeks,
you know?
And you know,
I think that's one to grow on.

755
00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.850
I don't care.
But I think that's some of they just don't,

756
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.990
just a bunch of bullshit,
everybody flipping out about it.

757
00:46:27.991 --> 00:46:30.990
It's such a Lazy God damn story.
And then you know where they always get started?

758
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.300
Some fat fucking bloggers site,

759
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:38.220
some victim dose makes a fucking video and then they always end up on those

760
00:46:38.221 --> 00:46:39.420
cheese balls sites.

761
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:43.740
Those list sites that steal six hours of your life.

762
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.610
Top 10 turtles in the Indian Ocean all of a sudden,
oh Geez.

763
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.400
I wonder if those look like,
you know,
how the fuck did you end up there?

764
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:55.110
The top 20 worst plastic surgery nightmares,

765
00:46:55.710 --> 00:47:00.710
the top 100 a porn star blow jobs in the month of March.

766
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:03.900
I made as much as I'm making fun of them,
I obviously,

767
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:07.140
because I can make fun of them.
I know what the fuck they are,
but,
um,

768
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.480
I don't know.
I'm just,
I know it's,
it's,

769
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:15.330
I don't think there is any outreach.
I don't,
I think when they just,

770
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:18.630
they just find like two or three fucking people and they just try to magnify it.

771
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.470
Right.
Someone will get upset about anything like this.

772
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:26.910
Fucking the chick up there in Oregon who had an inoperable brain cancer and

773
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:30.240
decided that she,
rather than go through it,
just wanted to die.

774
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.960
It was actually reading this story.

775
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:36.730
She went to Oregon because if you want to die up there,
they let you do it.

776
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:41.800
Um,
you know,
in the hospitals,
they're like,
wait a minute,

777
00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:46.600
how dare you decide to die?
And we don't make any money off of it.

778
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.720
That God dammit,
this goes against the Lord.

779
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.340
You need to come into our hospitals and lay there and we'll medicate you and

780
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:57.580
we'll just drag this fucking thing out and uh,

781
00:47:57.581 --> 00:48:00.340
then stick your alive relatives with a six figure bill.

782
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.290
How dare you go around all of that.

783
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.320
Did she basically medically speaking was off the grid.

784
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.280
So she decided to go up there.
It's actually fucking creeping me out.
You know,

785
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.640
she went up there and she picked out the house that she wanted to die in.

786
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.930
Just picked out like a little yellow house and uh,

787
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.500
and then just basically took drugs like I'm dying now.

788
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:22.510
Do you realize the fucking nerve that that takes?

789
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:27.310
I couldn't do that as much as like a,
yeah,
I could.

790
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:32.730
If you were getting put cement shoes on me and you gave me a cyanide pill,

791
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.720
which is probably a horrific death too,
but uh,
it's nice and quick.
Yeah,

792
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:40.990
I'd do it by,
it's thought to psych myself up.
You know?

793
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.990
I'm trying to think what prayer I could say to a higher power just in case it

794
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:48.190
actually exists that would exonerate me from all the fucking horrific shit that

795
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:50.650
I've done in my life.
Um,

796
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.140
I don't know if I could do that.
What would you rather do?

797
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:58.390
Would you rather just go to Oregon and Dinah Yellow House,

798
00:48:58.391 --> 00:49:01.150
hanging out with your friends?
Just watch a football game and be like,

799
00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:05.440
all right everybody,
that's the man.
I had a great time.
I keep going home.

800
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.250
See you later,
man.
I just fucking pop a pill.

801
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.560
I Dunno.
I don't know if guys,
I got nothing.

802
00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:16.980
I don't know what the fuck happened this week.
Oh,
I,
here's one for you.

803
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.910
Kansas City,
uh,
Kansas city royals lost the world series.
Man that killed me.

804
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.530
I wish they sent that guy home.
You know,

805
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:29.590
even if he got thrown out at the plate just to have a fucking,

806
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:34.210
somebody tried to get an inside the park home run in the ninth inning down by

807
00:49:34.211 --> 00:49:38.320
one bottom of the ninth at home.
Jesus Christ.

808
00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.630
I was watching that in the bar.
And,
um,
the second it,

809
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.720
it went by that guy,
I'm thinking,
all right,
that's a double clinic.

810
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:49.750
Went down there and he bounced off the wall and that guy kicked it or something.

811
00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:51.670
I'm like,
that's definitely a triple,
you know what kills me.

812
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:55.000
If that was Willie Wilson running the base path,

813
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.840
he definitely would have made it.
Ah,
that fucker would've made it.

814
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.030
He would have made it and then you know what you would have had,

815
00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:01.841
you had one of the,
we will,

816
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:04.180
you would have had one of the great plays in baseball.
However,

817
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.970
if anybody's going to sit around and give that guy shit is like,
you know,

818
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:11.770
he should've gone in let's say the same reason why he didn't go is why that guy

819
00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:13.870
in center field miss the fucking ball.

820
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.420
Cause it was the ninth inning of the world series.
You know what I mean?

821
00:50:16.421 --> 00:50:18.880
There's so much on the line.
That was the regular season.

822
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:22.200
That guy just would have let the blooper drop in.
But he ran in thinking,

823
00:50:22.201 --> 00:50:23.860
I've got to make a play.
You've got to make a play.

824
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:26.380
And then the second they hit the ground,
he looked like me out in the field.

825
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.500
You know,
I actually make fun of myself a lot athletically,
like I stink and uh,

826
00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:34.220
that nothing could be further from the truth.
A lot of people don't know.

827
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:38.150
I was actually drafted by the Texas longhorns to play baseball,
but,
uh,

828
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.990
I just decided,
you know,
I mean I just,

829
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:44.550
Roger Clemens was still there at the time and it was just,
you know,

830
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.110
I was just like,
you know,
it's his time.
It's his time.
I don't,

831
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.470
I don't want to do that to people.
Right.
Does anybody watching hockey at all?

832
00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.020
I've been so busy fucking looking at all this other shit.

833
00:50:54.021 --> 00:50:58.220
I haven't had no time to look at it whatsoever.
Although I do know that,
uh,

834
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:02.210
that the fucking Bruins beat the senators the other night,
didn't they?

835
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.510
Three at two and they shifted up the lines Bergey's line there.

836
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:08.940
They get my Shane and the other fucking lying or something be appeal.

837
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.080
I basically out of shit to talk about maybe for the first time ever.

838
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.970
So I'm just going to sit here and,
uh,

839
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.620
just can you guys just ride with me for the next couple of weeks while I,
well,

840
00:51:17.621 --> 00:51:18.110
I'm going to,

841
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.750
we're going to write and record these next couple episodes and then I'm going to

842
00:51:20.751 --> 00:51:23.180
be done with the F is for family shit.
Then we're going to animate it.

843
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:26.060
Then I'll actually have some free fucking time and I can actually live a little

844
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:29.240
bit of life and maybe actually have something to talk about.
Well,

845
00:51:29.241 --> 00:51:33.410
my God damn podcasts.
Mike,
what am I up to here?
Like 50 minutes,
51 minutes.

846
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:37.160
I gotta somehow figured out another nine minutes to shit that I have to talk

847
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:38.960
about me.
You know what?
You're not going to help me.

848
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.840
It is going to sit over there.
Go.
Oh,
we got another glitch.

849
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.330
Got another glitch in the fucking main board here.
Mike.

850
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:50.450
Has that ever happened?
Any podcast in here?
It is right.

851
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.240
What is with me and technology?
It's just,

852
00:51:53.241 --> 00:51:57.590
it just doesn't fucking work out for me.
I don't know.
All right.

853
00:51:57.591 --> 00:52:00.950
Whatever corpse found in a Costa Rican,

854
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:05.360
Concordia and rec assumed to be Russell Rebello.
No Way.
Not fucking Russell.

855
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:09.620
Rebello.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
This is my fucking phone.

856
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.480
Who is it?
Bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,

857
00:52:16.481 --> 00:52:21.260
bump,
bump,
bum.
I Shit,
I gotta take this guy.
Sorry.
Hello.

858
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:28.580
Hey,
I'm finishing up my podcast going to call you back in two seconds.
Okay,
cool.

859
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.810
Bye.
This is how bad I am with,
with technology.
The reason why,

860
00:52:32.811 --> 00:52:37.250
whenever my management calls I always pick up is because I know they probably

861
00:52:37.251 --> 00:52:42.251
sent me an email that I didn't see and I'm supposed to be somewhere that I'm

862
00:52:42.321 --> 00:52:45.550
not.
I really fucking hate the fact that people can get away with now.
Well,

863
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.620
you know,
like,
dude,
why didn't you tell me I sent you an email?

864
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:54.200
Why don't you just send a fucking carrier pigeon that doesn't fly back to you?

865
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:58.210
And like,
you should send a parrot is what you should do.
Send me the message.

866
00:52:58.211 --> 00:52:59.450
And then the parent comes back like,
wow,

867
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:03.710
I was able to give it to him and he read it.
Right?
He just send a fucking email.

868
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.060
Did they just imitate a parrot?

869
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:09.500
Is that how much I'm fucking struggling to fill time?
Yeah,

870
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:12.680
I don't fucking like when people do that shit,
they think I sent you an email.

871
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:16.700
It was all in the email.
It's like,
dude,
I get a thousand fucking Eto,

872
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:21.170
much porno I've watched on,
on,
uh,
on my computer,

873
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:25.620
Jesus Christ.
You know,
me fucking emails.
I get a day,
I've shit

874
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:31.170
on all of these fucking websites.
I can't even find emails anymore.

875
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:33.640
I get so much stuff.
And then people go,
oh,
why didn't you,
well,

876
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:38.430
why don't you just start a second account?
And yet on that one,
you know,

877
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:41.610
it's only for friends and family and all of that fucking shit because eventually

878
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:46.230
I'm going to have it open and I'm going to look at somebody,
uh,
you know,

879
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:48.630
fucking blow in somebody and then the next scene,
and again,

880
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:51.600
if they somehow they just get it,
there's no more privacy or whatever.

881
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.540
So that's the reason why it took the phone call.
I apologize.

882
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:56.670
That was unbelievably,
unbelievably.

883
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.930
It's probably typically I'm professional of me.
Um,

884
00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:05.430
yeah.
So anyways.
All right,
what do I got going on coming up anyways?

885
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.740
I know what I'm just going to hype,
the shit that I do have coming up.

886
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:11.010
I got to stand up special coming up.
Uh,
December 5th.

887
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:13.980
I know I bored you to death with this,
but I'd love if you watched it.

888
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.040
It's on Netflix and I've been getting shit about this,

889
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:19.860
that it's only on Netflix and then you're not gonna be able to buy it anywhere

890
00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:20.760
for like a year.

891
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:26.040
And all I have to say is you only have yourselves to blame for that.
All right?

892
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.580
If you cut fucking cunts would actually pay for the goddamn thing.

893
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:33.150
I could put up my own money for it,
you know,

894
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:37.620
but I can't put up my own money for it because only like maybe,
I don't know,

895
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:43.010
5,000 you will actually purchase the thing and that'll get me 25 grand back of

896
00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:47.190
about 180 grants.
So would you do a deal like that?
You wouldn't.
So what happened?

897
00:54:47.191 --> 00:54:50.190
Netflix put up the money.
So that's how it works.

898
00:54:50.191 --> 00:54:53.430
And in part of my agreement is that they own it exclusively for a year.

899
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.780
That's how it works.
But here's the thing,
you know some assholes,

900
00:54:56.781 --> 00:54:59.730
some going to whatever you fucking tech Geeks,
call it,

901
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:02.400
rip it and wrap it and fucking upload it.

902
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.680
And it's going to be on Youtube anyways,
so you'll just see it that way.
Okay,

903
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:12.000
so quit breaking my fucking balls about it.
Fucking nerds,
man,

904
00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:13.621
you out there.

905
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:16.790
You know how come they just keep making movies about fucking superheroes in,

906
00:55:16.791 --> 00:55:21.791
in a transformers and shit and apes taken over the planet because you stole all

907
00:55:21.811 --> 00:55:23.070
the other ones.
Just stole it.

908
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:26.070
He stole all the fucking where you get what you pay for.

909
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.920
You stopped paying for movies.
So now they're like,
fuck it.

910
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:31.170
We're going to make these movies that even if you steal them,

911
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:32.700
it's going to suck to watch at home.

912
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:36.120
They're either going to make those that are going to make little cheapies little

913
00:55:36.121 --> 00:55:37.920
cheapie ones where you've got to,
you know,

914
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:40.820
you've got to share a sleeping bag with the five other actors and the directors

915
00:55:40.821 --> 00:55:43.410
every day on a shoot.
Those are the only fucking movies they make it any more.

916
00:55:43.411 --> 00:55:45.630
And you know what,
you fucking cunts got no one to blame.
But yourself,

917
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:49.770
so I don't want to hear it.
So my special comes out December 5th on Netflix.

918
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:53.820
All right,
I should've called it you.
You get,
you get what you pay for.
Oh,

919
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:57.090
is that what you should have called it bill?
Ooh.
Then what's going to happen?

920
00:55:57.091 --> 00:56:00.750
How is it some group going to get upset?
Who's the latest guy?

921
00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.200
Chris rock got in trouble.
Chris rock got in trouble.
He got outraged.

922
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.700
He got some outrage.
He told some jokes and people were outraged.

923
00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:10.320
Some people or some groups.
How long?

924
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.830
You know what's funny about what he did was there's no real group.

925
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:17.220
I Guess Boston strong.
They could get outraged.

926
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.060
They could pretend to be outraged so they could sell more tee shirts.

927
00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:25.150
So then they can align their fucking pockets.
And then,
uh,
you know,

928
00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:29.590
maybe a couple of it trickles down to the actual victims of the bombing.

929
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.390
I swear to God,
like I would like to start it.

930
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:36.510
You know what the charity you should do is you just walk up to the person who

931
00:56:36.611 --> 00:56:41.200
got injured in the bombing and you just hand them a bag of cash that insurance

932
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:43.500
companies can't see.
So they don't say that this,
well,

933
00:56:43.501 --> 00:56:46.570
you now making this much money so that somehow cancels your policy.

934
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.050
We've got to somehow come up with something where you just get the money

935
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:55.000
directly to the wounded warrior,
directly to the victim of the,

936
00:56:55.001 --> 00:56:58.390
uh,
of the marathon bombings,
you know,

937
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.960
as opposed to these Mary Kay cosmetic fucking cunts who are standing in between

938
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:08.680
the,
the money in the victim,
like a fucking this sitting there like,

939
00:57:08.681 --> 00:57:11.710
like a windscreen.
I literally have my arms out right now acting this out,

940
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:15.940
just catching as much of the cash as they possibly can.
It's like a filter.

941
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:21.070
I Dunno,
I'm not saying they're all bad,

942
00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:26.710
but generally speaking,
you know what I mean?
People are fucking people and I,

943
00:57:26.711 --> 00:57:31.450
yeah,
you know,
I don't trust them.
I don't fucking trust them.
Is this bad?

944
00:57:31.451 --> 00:57:34.810
Am I,
you know what's funny is,
uh,
at some point I,

945
00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:39.220
I'm hoping to get to the level in this business that actually somebody will take

946
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:41.230
the time to get offended by something that I say.

947
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:44.200
Although the second show last night,
you know,

948
00:57:44.201 --> 00:57:45.700
it was David spade was in the crowd.

949
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:47.770
I didn't want to drop the name and I'm a fucking huge fan of his,

950
00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:50.680
so I wanted to impress him and then I went up there and I fucking ate my balls.

951
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.860
I didn't eat my balls.
I fucking kill you,
you know?

952
00:57:53.861 --> 00:57:57.070
And that was like the last set of the night.
It was my last sets in La.

953
00:57:57.071 --> 00:58:00.310
It's just lingering there.
So fortunately tonight I'm actually at flappers.

954
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:02.740
I swear to God,
that's the name of a comedy club.

955
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:08.410
I don't know why they always have to give him zany names like Xannies,
right.

956
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.430
Wackos,
bananas,
Fuck fucks.
Whatever the hell they call them.

957
00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:17.140
This one's called flappers.
And evidently it's because back in the day,
I dunno,

958
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:20.740
there was people that,
people who danced,
you know,

959
00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:23.620
like during the Vaudevillian days,
hey,
let's get some flappers out there.

960
00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:28.450
You know,
where we get the,
you know,
well the comics,
I dunno,
getting his puppet,

961
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.960
whatever the fuck they were doing.
Right.
So what happens?

962
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:35.090
So they named this Comedy Cup flappers and then all of waitresses and shit got

963
00:58:35.091 --> 00:58:37.680
addressed.
Like it's the 1920s.
And then the guy who runs the room,

964
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:41.710
he's got a fucking dress,
like he's got a fucking Tommy Gun and a violin case.

965
00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.230
I don't know why they do it.

966
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:48.070
I don't know why they don't sit down with other comedians that have a meeting

967
00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:51.730
and just say,
Hey,
do you think this is a good idea?
Oh,
speaking of which,

968
00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.010
you guys got to listen to the verse,
the effect this week,

969
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:58.870
another all things comedy.
A member Paul Versey,
um,

970
00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.930
somebody threw a fucking beer bottle at him.
Thank God they missed,

971
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:06.220
they threw a fucking beer bottle at him in verse.

972
00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:10.330
He did said he did some Matrix Shit and uh,
the guy missed him.

973
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:14.830
But like this is just classic comedy clubs,
security,
like,

974
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:18.480
I don't know if you guys realize,
but,
but throwing a beer bottle,
it's somebody,

975
00:59:18.481 --> 00:59:20.920
his fucking head is assault with a deadly weapon.

976
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.370
Like you literally can lose your I cave in your skull.

977
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.760
I had a buddy of mine in high school,
somebody smashed a bottle in his face.

978
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:30.800
He's scarred for life.
I haven't seen him in years,

979
00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:33.350
but I mean he had this big scar going from his forehead right down the side of

980
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:36.680
his face.
Totally affected them socially.
Like at,
when you talk to him,

981
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:38.870
he would shoot his face to the side and he was,

982
00:59:38.871 --> 00:59:41.930
this outgoing guy became all fucking self conscious and all that shit.
Right.

983
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.250
And um,
this guy does this shit.

984
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:50.090
Classic Comedy Club Security.

985
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.650
Do you know they didn't get the guy's name and he just fucking left.

986
00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:58.150
They're like,
oh,
he just ran out of here.
I said,

987
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.800
what do you mean he just fucking ran out?
Or does he just run out of here,

988
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.360
throw a fucking beer bottle at somebody?
I just fed her out.

989
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.790
He kind of slipped through our fingers.

990
01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:11.810
He just fucking ran out the door like Charlie Chaplin.

991
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:13.850
I'm not saying you got to go fight the guy,

992
01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.810
but with all the cell phone on camera video that you can get now,

993
01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:22.040
you couldn't video tape his fucking car that videotape what up?
I'm so old.

994
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:26.450
Whatever.
You couldn't get a VHS tape of him.
Him drive it out of the parking lot.

995
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.340
Just something,
a picture of his car,
anything.
That guy should be in fucking jail.

996
01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:33.911
Oh,
sorry.

997
01:00:33.911 --> 01:00:36.700
It's a good friend of mine sent me to a fucking beer bottle on it anyways,

998
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:39.550
so if you want to listen to the full story of it,
uh,

999
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:44.500
listened to the Versie effect this week and um,
that's it.
Mercifully,

1000
01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:47.560
I'm up here in an hour.
I apologize guys.
I had,
uh,
you know,

1001
01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.780
I didn't get it done this week.
You know,

1002
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.950
I think I started off strong with a test pilot.
Shit.
I Andy,

1003
01:00:52.951 --> 01:00:55.510
I ended up kind of weekly.
Well,
maybe I didn't.

1004
01:00:56.050 --> 01:01:00.460
Maybe you guys are actually enjoying it and I just can't hear the laughter.
Um,

1005
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:04.420
this weekend if you are in Bob Boston,
Massachusetts,

1006
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.440
I am doing a the 20th anniversary.
Believe it or not,

1007
01:01:08.441 --> 01:01:10.750
I can't believe it cause I think I was on the second or the third one,

1008
01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:11.981
so fucking old.

1009
01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:16.981
I am the 20th anniversary of a great charity where the money actually goes to

1010
01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:20.740
the people that need it.
Uh,
the Cam Neely,
uh,

1011
01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:25.300
Cam Nealy House comics come home,
the 20th anniversary.
Uh,

1012
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:27.940
Dennis leary is kind of hosted,
has always,

1013
01:01:27.941 --> 01:01:32.620
he put together this charity with Cam Neely 20 years ago.
You know,

1014
01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:35.920
from day one it was a big deal.
I remember the doe the year that we did it,

1015
01:01:35.921 --> 01:01:40.921
they actually filmed it for a comedy central and now somehow it is in its 20th

1016
01:01:41.891 --> 01:01:44.260
year.
I remember a few years ago was in the 15th year.
I was like,

1017
01:01:44.261 --> 01:01:48.220
how the fuck is it 15 years ago,
you know,
it feels like two years ago,

1018
01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:51.520
five years ago,
goes by like two years now at my age.

1019
01:01:51.521 --> 01:01:53.290
So that's kind of terrifying.
But anyways,

1020
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:58.450
it's going to be a murderer's row of comedians.
And,
uh,
as far as I know,

1021
01:01:58.451 --> 01:02:01.120
I think they're putting me on last,
as I mentioned last week and that,

1022
01:02:01.121 --> 01:02:04.210
and that's what you do on that show.
You do not headline you go on last.

1023
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:09.370
So I gotta make sure my,
my game is,
uh,
up to snuff.

1024
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.780
So,
uh,
I don't get fucking,
I don't get a bunch of shit.
You know,
it's funny,

1025
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:16.510
he was under the wedding.
I went to this week,
uh,

1026
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.360
I hung out with a buddy of mine that was from Boston and I haven't been around

1027
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:25.560
that vibe
that like that much,
that consistently,

1028
01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:27.480
it's just the level of defensiveness.

1029
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:32.080
Somehow we started talking about sneakers and,
uh,

1030
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.220
we were saying how,
you know,
Oh,
you know,

1031
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:39.480
people will stand in line for sneakers and people get beat up and shot over

1032
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:41.430
sneakers and sometimes he's these sneaker heads,

1033
01:02:41.431 --> 01:02:44.480
they buy these fucking sneakers and then they put them in the back of the
closet,

1034
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:47.490
just,
they can break them out five years later.
So people like,
ah,
fuck,

1035
01:02:47.491 --> 01:02:52.170
where did you get those?
And this dude totally fucking Boston.
It's just like,

1036
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.870
it's just like,
yeah,
don't,
I don't,
I don't get that it up like my whole life.

1037
01:02:57.871 --> 01:03:01.680
Like I never been in this shit,
you know?

1038
01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:05.220
Like I'm not,
I'm not in Shit,

1039
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.780
like really choppy talking.
Like we were just having this conversation.

1040
01:03:10.781 --> 01:03:12.960
You just kind of jumps in like that.
It would just looking at him like,

1041
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:17.460
what do you mean you're not into anything?
You like to fish?
He's like,
yeah dude,

1042
01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:21.750
but I wouldn't like buy a fucking pole and then stick it in my closet and pull

1043
01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:23.820
it out five years later.
Oh look at it.
Shit.

1044
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:26.160
Like every fucking thing was like that.

1045
01:03:26.161 --> 01:03:31.110
He went up to go a do a drink run and he comes back said,
yeah dude,

1046
01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:35.110
what the fuck's with that bartender?
You know,
I go update or what are your Barb?

1047
01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.920
And the guy's like,
do you want it neat?
Do you want it on the rocks?
It's like,

1048
01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:40.320
dude,
I don't want the fuck.
That means just put it in a glass.

1049
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:45.630
You know what the fuck.
So anyways,

1050
01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:49.440
I want to be performing for people like that next weekend to raise money for
raw,

1051
01:03:49.441 --> 01:03:53.640
the Cam Nealy House.
Um,
all right,
that's it.
I'm sorry.
He ended with a whimper.

1052
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.270
He came in like a dope shit.
Ended out like a con.
All right,

1053
01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:00.060
that's a podcast for this week.

If you don't,
who gives a fuck?

1060
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:22.590
I didn't talk about Halloween.
I got to talk about Halloween real quick.

1061
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.960
This is like a comic that will not get off stage.

1062
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:26.400
He's just trying to get the last big laugh.

1063
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.010
Mike's over in the corner like for fuck sakes.
I've got a life to get on with it.

1064
01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.940
Um,
we finally figured out,
we finally figured out Halloween.

1065
01:04:32.941 --> 01:04:33.830
This is the way you do it.

1066
01:04:33.831 --> 01:04:38.831
Cause last year we did not give out candy because my lovely wife was so fucking

1067
01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:41.730
sick of all the high school kids and they're precocious.

1068
01:04:41.731 --> 01:04:43.530
Can't kids in the fucking,
uh,

1069
01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:47.190
adults that show up and they want candy and they say,
fucked up shit.

1070
01:04:47.191 --> 01:04:49.950
This is how you do Halloween.
All right.

1071
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:54.210
The first hour is the best.
It's all little kids,

1072
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.170
little cutie pie kids with parents who are excited and it's their kids.

1073
01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:00.060
Like first to second Halloween,
the first one,

1074
01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:03.870
the first kid that showed up to the door,
he was dressed like a little fireman,

1075
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:08.670
right?
And I'm like,
Oh,
look at you,
a little firemen are you doing?
And I,
you know,

1076
01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.360
I crouched down and uh,

1077
01:05:10.361 --> 01:05:14.790
I hold the bowl out to give him the candy and this adorable little kid reaches

1078
01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:15.480
in,

1079
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.480
grabs one of the candy bars and then goes to hand it to me how I am like,

1080
01:05:20.491 --> 01:05:24.790
no,
no,
you get to keep it.
You get to keep it fucking adorable as hell.
Right?
Uh,

1081
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:28.450
and then he turns around,
he goes to walk away,
the back of his jacket is ranked,

1082
01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:32.770
this little rain coats said a fire chief.
It was adorable.
Has held.

1083
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:34.540
But then he stopped was hilarious.

1084
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:36.680
He stopped and he walked back and he reached in,

1085
01:05:36.681 --> 01:05:39.760
he grabbed another piece of candy and putting like,
he got it,
you know,

1086
01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.170
and then I was thinking,
oh,
that's cute.

1087
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:44.890
Slash he's on his way to be in like these country kids that are going to be

1088
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:45.910
coming here in an hour.

1089
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:50.110
So there's an hour of these cute kids and then the next hour you get these

1090
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:51.540
precocious kids,
right.

1091
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.810
Who think everything they say is so fucking brilliant and the adults are stupid.

1092
01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.160
Right.
And these kids come up and as I'm going to give him first kid,
you know,

1093
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.610
there's this group of kids and one of them comes up to the door and I'm just

1094
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:07.390
like,
he looked like he was the grim reaper and I'm like,
ah,
the grim reaper.

1095
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:09.730
And he's like,
Oh,
I'm not the grim reaper.

1096
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.020
I'm so insult from like either Harry Potter or fucking Lord of the rings.

1097
01:06:14.021 --> 01:06:16.630
I don't know what he was supposed to do it.
It's just like,
dude,
fuck you.

1098
01:06:16.631 --> 01:06:17.800
You look like the grim reaper.

1099
01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:21.430
How many houses are you going to go to when they gets grim reaper before you

1100
01:06:21.431 --> 01:06:25.450
blame yourself that you made a bad costume,
you little Douche,
right?

1101
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:28.570
So I'm like,
I'm sorry man.
I didn't see the movie.
And he goes,

1102
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:33.130
who could you lease read the book.
I want to go to fucking boot of greatness.

1103
01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:36.550
Seventh grade ass or,
and then another group of kids,

1104
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:39.680
they come there and we all fucking give him candy and then they start singing.

1105
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.390
We wish you a merry Christmas.
Me,
they start Carolyn on my front porch.

1106
01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.860
Like this is blowing my mind.
Like I'm going to be like,
wait a minute,

1107
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.680
what holiday is it?
That's what I can't stand.

1108
01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.830
It's the fact that they think that they're smarter than you.

1109
01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.300
This is why it's so great.
I never had kids.

1110
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:57.190
I would have been such a bad parent because I just want to be like,

1111
01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.230
do you think he really fucking with me right now?
I had water damage on a house.

1112
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.450
I have a fucking mortgage.
I have a Goddamn wife.

1113
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:09.370
Do you think right now what you're doing is blowing my mind?
Hi.
You little fuck.

1114
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.890
I just,
I dunno.
And then what we did.

1115
01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:14.110
So then we wrote it out through those douchebags cause it's still,

1116
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:15.070
there was some little kids,

1117
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:20.071
cute kids coming up and then what you do is the first fucking kid who looks like

1118
01:07:22.031 --> 01:07:27.031
he's pushing a high school age and has that Shitty grin look on his face.

1119
01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.560
What I should've done was just slammed the door in his face,
said he was too big,

1120
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.390
but I didn't cause I don't want anybody fucking with my house.

1121
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.640
What you do is you let him,
one guy get you,

1122
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.850
you give him the candy and the second he leaves,
that's it.

1123
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:43.810
Oh you blow out the candle and the Pumpkin,
you shut off the porch light.

1124
01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.970
You just shut it down.
It's over.

1125
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:50.540
He shut out all the lights in your house and you go down into the bowels of your

1126
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:54.670
house or into some closet and you just pour yourself a drink and you'll wait

1127
01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:57.760
there for 90 minutes and then it's over.
That's how you do Halloween.
All right,

1128
01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:00.730
there you go.
Now,
that's a podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

1129
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.950
I will talk to you next week.
Thank you for listening.
