00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.950
Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon?

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.780
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast,
Dan.

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.070
Ah,
just checking in on you.
What's going on?

4
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:17.060
How's your week going?

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.250
Are you having a good time with the people in your life?
If you're not,

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.080
drink some booze.

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.400
Go down to the pub all by yourself.

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.450
Preferably during the day.
There's nothing better than day drinking.

9
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.730
I'll tell you that right now.
A lot of people think,
oh,

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.200
holding my child day during a disease.

11
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:40.790
I don't think so.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.270
Shitting and a bar during the day,

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.220
you know one of those bars where you know the sun barely fucking comes in,
right?

14
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:51.770
One of those fucking places don't meet a gay bar.
All right,

15
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:55.520
let me tell you right now.
Now,
one of those gay bars were what's accepted now,

16
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.570
right?
Don't gay bars have like fucking ceiling.
The floor windows,

17
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.830
right?
We're here.
We're queer.
We'd like some fucking pairs.
Now.

18
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.240
What goes on there?
I don't know.
I haven't got caught up on will and grace.

19
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.080
I'm sorry.
That was a stupid mood.

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.710
Uh,
yeah.
Day Drinking,
day drinking.

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.960
But I always at the Beatles should have made that instead of day tripper.

22
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.840
She was a day drink.
Fucking booze it.

23
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.890
Yeah.
It took us

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.330
to get drunk.
Now she's drunk.
Boldo they [inaudible] do,

25
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:38.480
do,
do,
do,
do,
do.
Um,
I've been writing all day.

26
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.550
We got a table read tomorrow morning,

27
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:44.080
so it's actually Wednesday evening and I'm doing this,
uh,

28
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.980
in my spotless home,
my spotless Ho,
Ho,

29
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.870
Ho home.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
My wife is on the road again.

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.730
Right.
She's out visiting some fucking friends or whatever.
Um,

31
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.920
or having an affair.
I don't know.
I can't keep tabs on her.

32
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.830
I only have an iPhone six,
you know,

33
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.740
if I had one of those phones that they already have in Japan,

34
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:10.060
I could probably watch it from a satellite and then texture,

35
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.910
you know,
while I played that creepy stinks on,
I guess it's the police.
Right.

36
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.640
I'll be watching you.
I remember I was sitting,
when that song came out,
they said,

37
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.910
uh,
you know,
that song actually makes men beat women.
It's like,
no,

38
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:29.080
I would say a poor childhood would,

39
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:32.810
would probably be bigger than stinks fucking song.

40
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.520
You know that was back when you really could try to blame musicians for fucking,

41
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.550
for your own bad parenting.
You know what I mean?

42
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.590
There was devil in the music and you play it backwards and you sucked as a

43
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:46.424
mother.

44
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.040
Well and then this Sean here reminds him of this and him dad.
Yes.
Small point.

45
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:57.041
It was in the womb to shut up already that Tipper Gore and all of them slapping

46
00:02:57.651 --> 00:02:59.770
those stickers all over the place.
Right.

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.420
Meanwhile the and the Illuminati dressing up like pheasants stick in their

48
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.420
fucking fist in each other's asses all that's what goes down.

49
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.450
That's what happens.
That's the,

50
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.570
that's the kind of thing that CNN and Fox News are too afraid to talk about.

51
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.790
That's why they're always going after fucking comedians.

52
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.680
If we do a Bruce Jenner joke,

53
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:25.640
it's just a big misdirection cause they really don't want to know or let the,

54
00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:30.641
the regular people know how much fisting is going on at the upper 1% of wealth.

55
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.990
But I'll get to that later.
I'll get to that later.
Um,

56
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.420
anyways,
that was a big weekend sport.

57
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.730
This is how little soccer fucking matters in the United States when Leicester

58
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.450
City did,
which is basically the impossible.

59
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.380
They won the premier league.
And I know there's a lot of yanks,

60
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.540
Laura Yankee cancellous and in right now.
Right.
Um,
basically the premier league,

61
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.150
in my mind,
in my world,

62
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.160
in my pasty freckled a lonely world,

63
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.850
I would say that the premier league,
if you're gonna watch soccer,

64
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.990
that's what the fuck you watch.
I would even say fuck the World Cup.

65
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.000
The World Cup is like the Saint Patrick's day of fucking soccer where every

66
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.810
douche bag who barely even gives a fuck shows up and then they fucking somebody

67
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.010
somebody gets puked on.
Right.
The Premiere League.

68
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:31.360
That's the real shit.
That is the real shit.
It just sounds real.

69
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.020
That looks real.
I ain't eight one.
I actually,
if I put that shit on,

70
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.660
if it's a little bit cold out,
you know,

71
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.510
it feels like that's Shitty fucking England.
Whether I'll actually watch it in,

72
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.530
which means a lot.
You know what I mean?

73
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:47.500
Cause I know the fucking people over in England,
they don't watch NFL football.

74
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:50.740
They think it's stupid.
Right.
Everybody running around,
you know,

75
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:55.660
in shape with good dentists dental work.
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.680
Um,
anyways,
so what I love about the premier league,

77
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.920
and I'm going to fuck this up.
It's been explained to me 50 times.

78
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.140
I just don't have enough time in my life to pay attention.

79
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:10.141
But the one thing that I do that I think is fucking hilarious is with all our

80
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.740
leagues over here,
if you're in the NHL,
you're in the NHL year in the NFL.

81
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.680
If you're in the NFL,
you just in there,
no matter how bad you,

82
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.410
you're fucking in there.
All right.

83
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.320
Like take the New York Yankees right now in the fucking

84
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.230
right.
I watched a little baseball this week.
Um,
I just happen to catch it.

85
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.600
I didn't even know the red sox are playing the Yankees.
Did we sweep them?

86
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.160
I think we did.
I think that made us go into first place.
Oh,

87
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:42.700
well my talking shit about a sport I never watched.
I think I am.
Um,

88
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.180
I actually liked it.
The,
uh,
the Panda Guy,
and I wish this on anybody,

89
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:46.961
but he's out.

90
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:50.710
So now we kind of don't really have any big free agents and I'll feel like the

91
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:55.270
Yankees really do either.
So I kind of like it.
It seems like it's gone back.

92
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.310
It's settled down the roids or right of the game.

93
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.990
All the big free agent fucking things.
It's just kind of settled down.
Um,

94
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.190
and this might sound fucked up to a red sox fan,

95
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:10.010
but I don't want the Yankees being last place.
I don't want to be right there,

96
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.040
right there with us,
you know,
slugging it out.

97
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.250
And then the last day of the year we give them the old right there,
Fred.

98
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.840
And then we go to fucking the playoffs.
That's what I want.
But I,
I'm,
I'm,

99
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.060
I'm going,
I'm,
I'm getting off the fucking highway here.

100
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:26.990
I need to get back on here.
So in the premier league,
this is a great,

101
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:28.970
that I think it's the last two teams,

102
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:33.440
the bottom two teams every year in the premier league,
if you suck,

103
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.250
if you suck the bag of Dicks,
basically,
if you just weren't,

104
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.310
everybody was kicking the shit out of you basically.

105
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.990
Meaning they scored like two goals on you,
you know,
it absent,

106
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:49.460
they got mad,
they lit up to goals and fucking nine hours.

107
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.710
Um,
they get bounced right out of the fear out of the fucking leak.

108
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.260
You know what I mean?
Like say a,
I don't know,

109
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.200
I'm trying to think of somebody and it's just so much parody in the fucking NFL.

110
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.900
We'll say the Tampa Bay Buccaneers back back in the day,

111
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:06.140
like when they went oh and 14,
boom,
you're out of the league,
you know,

112
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.900
and the Detroit lions,
you're out of the league.
And then they give,

113
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:12.710
they give some other clubs that chance.
And um,

114
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.000
and that happens every year.

115
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.510
And that's what I guess that's the way it becomes a premier league.
I don't know.

116
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.560
You'd think they'd just take all the best guys and stick them on 30 teams like

117
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:24.020
we do.
But this is different,
you know,
you'd think they'd brushed their teeth.

118
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.140
There's a whole bunch of things that you would think that they would do over

119
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:31.220
there,
but they choose not to.
You know,
it's funny,
I went over there,

120
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.560
I didn't really notice any worse teeth,
you know,

121
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.540
than they have over here.
Depending on where you're at.
I Dunno,

122
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.170
I just like breaking their balls and plus I'm going to be coming over there in

123
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:43.910
August.
It's looking like,

124
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.090
so I figure I might as well prime the pump by truck and shit about them.

125
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.830
God knows if I just said how much I enjoy going over there and traveling through

126
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:53.630
Europe,
if I said that,
that's boring.

127
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:56.990
So what you got to do to get people to come to shows as you got to shit on their

128
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:01.350
country.
Right.
So anyways,
um,

129
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.070
so after the end of the last last season,

130
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.920
two teams got kicked out and two new teams get brought in this little ass team

131
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:14.240
called Lester city right there.
Weird.
We're spelling it.

132
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.800
M God brought up and they were a 5,000 to one chance to win the whole fucking

133
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.090
thing.
5,000 to one.

134
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.480
Meaning if you put $1 on them at the beginning of the,

135
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.000
the thing you would have won $5,000.
You get it.

136
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.810
If you put $2 down,
all right,

137
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.790
you woulda got $10,000.
If you put 50 cents on those fuckers,

138
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:46.010
you woulda got $2,500 is that right?
Yeah.

139
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.300
Yeah.
Um,
anyways,

140
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.550
I'm just trying to say that doesn't make sense to me.

141
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:56.450
You wouldn't do that or what'd Ya mathematically does,

142
00:08:56.451 --> 00:09:00.770
but in my head I just keep thinking five times one.
I'm seeing a five there.

143
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.030
I'll have to do it later,
but I think it's 20.
It's got to be $2,504 5,000.

144
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.680
I mean,
shit,
that's only fair.
All right.
So anyways,

145
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.510
plumbing your head here.
Um,
those motherfuckers one,
the whole thing.

146
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.590
I know there's a lot of people thought those one to two quickly.
Um,

147
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.360
I guess the US Olympic team in 1980 was like thousand to one,

148
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.890
and I forget what the mets were in 69.
Um,

149
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.820
but basically those were the two biggest sports underdogs and anybody could

150
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:36.821
think of in the u s or at least the person I was talking to and Leicester City

151
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:40.550
was five times that.
And,
um,

152
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.470
that was such a big fucking deal.

153
00:09:42.471 --> 00:09:47.471
I actually went on the internet to see reaction videos of fans of that club

154
00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:51.440
losing their fucking shit.
And I just sat there laughing in a good way,

155
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.450
seeing how happy people were.
Um,
that's always the grace.

156
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:57.890
I don't know why that is the greatest,

157
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:00.900
but it's always the greatest with somebody who just like out of fucking nowhere,

158
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:04.490
it comes along and wins it.
You know,
it's the whole rocky story,
right?

159
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.800
So congratulations to them.
Um,

160
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.850
but I think as much as that's the greatest sports thing in recent memory,

161
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:17.600
I think,
um,
in the U s we're going to eclipse that very quickly.

162
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.340
Uh,
if we haven't already,
because I have to,

163
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.210
I'd have to think what would the fucking odds that Donald Trump was going to

164
00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:28.220
secure the Republican,

165
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.120
whatever the fuck the Republican National Convention Party,

166
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:32.930
whatever they call them,

167
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.220
they're not be the presidential nominee for that fucking party.

168
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.280
Do you understand that Ted Cruz

169
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:48.220
throwing in the towel and everybody said he elbowed his wife.
He didn't.

170
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.870
Okay.
She was third man in,
I tweeted about this.
If you look what happened,

171
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.270
he hugged her first,
right?

172
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.390
And then he went in for the man hug and then she,

173
00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:03.550
they know according to the Nhl rule of third man in,
if there's,

174
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.020
if there's an altercation already happening and a third party enters it,

175
00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:10.360
it's an on an automatic game misconduct.

176
00:11:10.361 --> 00:11:13.260
So she should have got a game misconduct.
Right.

177
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.170
And if she's done that before in the past,
you know,

178
00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:21.250
maybe she should get a suspension.
I'll tell you,
it was fucking hilarious.

179
00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:22.600
She hung in there like a trooper.

180
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.660
She took knuckled and a couple of fucking elbows.

181
00:11:25.661 --> 00:11:29.350
She looked like she was trying to stop one of those little kitty merry go rounds

182
00:11:29.351 --> 00:11:33.340
with their head,
you know,
just kept taking a fucking bar to the skull.

183
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.030
Um,
he then did then did include her.

184
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.290
I thought it was weird that she wanted to hug with those two men.
Um,

185
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.320
I don't know much about Ted Cruz,
but I think,
uh,
I don't know.

186
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:51.090
I felt a weird sorta Rotisserie vibe there from his wife that I think already

187
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:53.950
occurred.
You know,
they will probably hugging saying,
all right,

188
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:57.610
we're going to do this.
Let's do it now.
Okay.
I told you I couldn't do it.

189
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.810
You know,
I'm running for president.
I don't need that ship.

190
00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:03.730
And now it's over and I'm just a senator now,
so yeah.
You know,

191
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.340
I'll be on the other end where you're fucking my wife,
however,

192
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.880
blow me a little bit,
you know,
I don't give a shit,
you know,
just,

193
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:14.470
just push this bill through.
Isn't that how politics work?
I have no idea.
Let,
let,

194
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:18.010
let's get back to us talking about,
so fucking,
what's his name?

195
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.930
They're fucking a willy willful.

196
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:24.490
They're the fucking guy with the toupee comes back around again,
right?

197
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.673
Donald Trump.

198
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.570
I just want the American people to know that by giving him that fucking position

199
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:35.800
in politics,

200
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.430
you just cleared the way for Hillary Clinton to become president and I don't

201
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:43.840
want to hear a fucking word out of any you republicans,
not a fucking word.

202
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.880
This is the guy you picked.
You got no one to blame,
but just selves.

203
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.760
The only thing I do like about Donald Trump,

204
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.290
Trump actually being nominated is it makes me feel like it makes my conspiracy

205
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:59.590
theory,
like go down.

206
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.460
Like there's no way.
They don't count the votes.

207
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.690
If that guy got in,

208
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.620
I used to think they just pretended to count the votes and then they just stuck

209
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.720
this like nobody wants that fucking guy yet.

210
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.210
I know some of the most staunch Republicans you could possibly fucking run into

211
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.140
and they have their head in their hands going,
how the fuck?

212
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.990
How the fuck did this guy become president and I,
that's,
that's easy.
That's easy.

213
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:28.390
All you have to do is look at pop music.

214
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.730
He just look at the shit that sells on TV,

215
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.300
but your horse screaming and yelling at each other.
You know what I mean?

216
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.710
It's inevitable.
I have to be honest.
You,
I cannot fucking believe that this guy,

217
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.100
he's a fucking star of a reality show.

218
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.600
This is worse than when Schwartzenegger ran fucking California.
This is fucking

219
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.190
my God.
It's just unbelievable.
It's unfucking believable.
But anyways,

220
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:58.240
congratulations to less to city.
Um,

221
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.000
there must have been insane.
That's something that,
you know,

222
00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:04.450
that's one of those ones you're going to talk about until you're like fucking a,

223
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.160
I still talk about the red sox coming back in 2004,
um,

224
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.170
out of all the championships,
um,
you know,

225
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.270
Boston is one in the last 10 years and I can't say that 10,
12 years.
I mean,

226
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:24.190
we won a bunch of them.
Um,
that was the one that was the fucking,

227
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.310
you know,
it's a fucking Yankee say had like 26 championships.

228
00:14:27.311 --> 00:14:30.880
We had one in like fucking 86 years down oh three.
I mean,

229
00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:34.840
that was like a fucking,
it was like Jimmy Fallon Drew Barrymore,

230
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:37.530
a fucking movie there.
Right.
They actually had to throw that.

231
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.260
They didn't even have that in the fucking script because they were in that movie

232
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.200
going on on,
Nah,
this is going to seem too unbelievable.

233
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:47.500
And then it fucking happened and they had to change the ending to the movie.

234
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:52.070
That's,
that's incredible.
And um,
oh man,

235
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:56.210
I'll never forget that fucking cop if fucking New York City cop when we were

236
00:14:56.211 --> 00:15:01.211
down oh three and I was still wearing my red sox hat blocking down the street in

237
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:03.860
New York and he fucking laughed.
He goes,
look at this fucking guy,

238
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.710
blah blah blah blah.
Just laughing.

239
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.290
And I remember we won the next game and the next,

240
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.590
next and everyday I'd walk out of my apartment going right by the same place

241
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:16.160
looking for that fucker.
And I never saw him again.
I'm like,

242
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:20.180
what was I going to do?
Point in my head,
you fucking pig and they get arrested.

243
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:21.140
That wasn't going to do that.

244
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.390
I would have shot him a dirty look and he would have been like,

245
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:27.440
what the fuck was that about?
Because I never had the balls to talk shit.

246
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:28.940
You know what it was.
Cause I knew he was right.

247
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.820
I agreed with them after game three where we lost like 19 to eight or some shit.

248
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.100
So anyways,
I'm congratulations.

249
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:40.480
I always love seeing shit like that when a team like that,
uh,

250
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.460
comes out of fucking nowhere.
So that's uh,
that's awesome.

251
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:48.370
And speaking of of sports,
believe it or not,
with my busy schedule,
I've actually,

252
00:15:48.371 --> 00:15:52.400
um,
because I live on the west coast,
mercifully,
um,

253
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.280
I've been able to a watch most of the fucking games.

254
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.170
Then with the lovely Nia out of town,

255
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:59.270
I've been just living like a fucking bachelor.

256
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.950
Like you should see how much the Tivo or whatever the fuck he call it,

257
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:08.540
the record thing,
how much it's changed.
It was just her show her,

258
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:11.270
show her,
show her,
show her show my show her show her,

259
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.100
she takes fucking everything,

260
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.260
every motherfucking real housewife fucking thing.
She loves those shows.

261
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.620
Real housewives of Atlanta,
real housewives of New Jersey.

262
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:26.010
Real housewives of fucking Orange County.
Uh,

263
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.080
did some hip hop love show,
whatever the fuck that one's called.

264
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.270
And then she'll Chins,
you know,
she'll have like fucking,
I dunno,
citizen Kane,

265
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.830
she's one way or the other city that's just absolute fucking unbelievable.
Or,

266
00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:43.130
or just like shit,
there is no middle ground with them.
Right.

267
00:16:43.131 --> 00:16:45.320
And then every once in a while I'll have a game on there.

268
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.480
So now that she's been gone,
it's like I'm,

269
00:16:48.481 --> 00:16:53.180
I'm recording every fucking game,
every fucking game.
Uh,

270
00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:57.290
although I'm missing the fucking capitalism penguins right now.
Um,

271
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.250
but I've been watching the blues.
I've been watching the sharks.
Hey,

272
00:17:01.251 --> 00:17:04.910
I'm warming up to the sharks.
I liked those bearded fuckers.
You know what?

273
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:09.170
There's something scummy about him and I don't know,
I relate to it.
Um,

274
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.810
I also like the pride.
I kind of like everybody who's left,

275
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.440
except for the penguins on the eye.
I know root against the penguins.
I just,

276
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:17.510
every time I see him,
it's like he stole our colors.

277
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:19.820
You fucking have pieces of shit and your ring of honor.

278
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.420
That's just something about him.
You know,
I don't hate him.

279
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.000
You know the reason why I don't hate them,
it's because I love Joe Bart,
Nick,

280
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:28.730
and he loves the penguin.
So I sorta fucking route forum,

281
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.360
but I always just think like these are the guys with the knee breakers who then

282
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:35.090
wine when people try and take their knees and I don't understand it.

283
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.460
They came into the league,
they took our colors.

284
00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:41.480
It's just like this like room for a joke thief.
I know what they gonna say.
Oh,

285
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:45.020
you took him from you fucking Steelers.
No,
he didn't.
No,
he didn't.

286
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:46.140
It was fucking hockey.
We,
we've,

287
00:17:46.141 --> 00:17:51.141
we've been around since the fucking 1920s it was not fucking Pittsburgh Steelers

288
00:17:51.741 --> 00:17:54.440
in 1929 I'll get,
I'll tell you right now,
I don't give a fuck if there was,

289
00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.790
was there for me.
Actually check here.

290
00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.590
1929 Pittsburgh.

291
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

292
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.060
<v 0>Steelers.
Let's see if they're around.
Doo,
Doo,</v>

293
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:10.560
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Myron copes,
Pittsburgh Steelers,
official.

294
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:15.180
Terrible tower towel.
No.
Oh,

295
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:18.810
wait a minute.
Pittsburgh Steelers,
and maybe it was,
go to Wikipedia in here.

296
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.230
You know,
it's funny right now,
like 99% of people in Pittsburgh now,

297
00:18:23.231 --> 00:18:25.860
the answer to this question already,
there's such maniac fans.
Yeah,

298
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.090
I mean that in a respectful way.
Oh,
you know what?
I don't give a fuck.

299
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.800
God knows they're all going to correct me anyways.

300
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:36.060
I don't need to look this shit up.
Um,
but anyways,

301
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.110
plowing ahead here.
Uh,
I've been watching all that stuff.
Um,

302
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.510
I don't think that I've even though the blues or playing fucking great.
Um,

303
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.770
I think when Tyler's Sagan comes back,
we'll see.
We'll see what the fuck happens.

304
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.090
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Dallas has a little bit of a,

305
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.580
a gold tender ratio.
Um,
it was a bad game.

306
00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.770
It was a bad game for him.
Whatever.

307
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:03.130
He fucking [inaudible] plow ahead your flower head.
Um,
I believe in Jamie Ben,

308
00:19:03.131 --> 00:19:05.110
they'll that guys got that fucking messy a vibe.

309
00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:08.400
So I would never say that it's over until it is fucking over.

310
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:10.890
But it's looking good for the blues.
My,
uh,

311
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.570
my foster hockey parents since my Bruins shit,
the bed towards the end,

312
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:16.201
we didn't shut the bed.

313
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:19.500
We actually had a great fucking year for everybody we got rid of.

314
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.130
It's just sucks that we thought we were going to make the playoffs and we went

315
00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:26.070
out west and the whole thing fell apart.
But I've talked about that before.

316
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.710
Hey Bill,
how's your,

317
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:34.080
how's the fucking Sayada Qca um,
like the candles.

318
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:39.030
A rock he's fucking Dean says.
Um,
so I'm actually almost a hundred percent.

319
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.360
I open my hundred percent because,
uh,

320
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.060
I got to get on a plane and I got a flight of Florida is,

321
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:48.540
I used to say as a kid and I'm doing a run of dates out there,
Hollywood,
Florida,

322
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.100
Orlando,
Florida in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Um,

323
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.120
and uh,
I think,
am I right?
These fucking stretches of the shit.

324
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.740
I actually tweeted a link.
Um,

325
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.870
if you have any sort of cyanic neuro thing,
it really helped me.

326
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:04.681
I hope it helps you.

327
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:07.560
And actually the guy who made the videos actually tweeted back to me.
So yeah,

328
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:11.970
she listens to the podcast or something,
which is fucking crazy to me.
Um,

329
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.260
and I guess the only other thing to tell you about is the,
uh,

330
00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.700
is the fucking weight room that I got go.
I haven't looked at it yet today,

331
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:25.470
but um,
I finally had them show up.
You know,

332
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.910
I told you when we opened up the fucking see on if you saw the god Damn Weekend

333
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:31.560
Warrior Horse Shit.

334
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.070
You know what kills me is when I think about this house being like

335
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.880
almost a hundred years old,

336
00:20:39.881 --> 00:20:42.820
I just think of all the people that have walked through here and shit.

337
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.060
You know what I mean?
Like American horror story.

338
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.410
And I sit there and I pictured them and I'm not afraid of them.

339
00:20:49.411 --> 00:20:52.620
I'm just sort of trying to picture them and I'm trying to picture what the

340
00:20:52.621 --> 00:20:56.580
fucking Douche bag.
Who did that work down there in the garage look like?

341
00:20:56.581 --> 00:21:00.360
Or his friend?
I told you when we open the fucking ceiling up,

342
00:21:00.361 --> 00:21:02.910
I just looked at the contract and I was just like,
what do you,

343
00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:05.260
what the guy who built this,
what do you think he did for a living?

344
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:06.540
Can you think he was a mailman?

345
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:07.890
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

346
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:12.120
<v 0>Was he a,
did he usually fucking a stand behind a team of oxen?</v>

347
00:21:12.121 --> 00:21:15.450
I don't know what he did,
but he sure as hell wasn't a fucking contractor.

348
00:21:15.451 --> 00:21:18.660
So they finally went up there and they,
um,

349
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.120
<v 1>yeah,</v>

350
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.050
<v 0>you know,
while I was at work,</v>

351
00:21:21.051 --> 00:21:25.610
I came home and they had an all fucking framed properly.
Chanel,

352
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.890
you don't have to worry about how fucking funny would that be?

353
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.670
Would it be funny for me to be funny for you guys if I finally had a gym built

354
00:21:31.671 --> 00:21:34.160
in my garage and I was down there in the above,

355
00:21:34.161 --> 00:21:36.290
it collapsed and killed me when I was trying to work out.

356
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.740
Let me ask the kind of thing that Canadian shook would say would be ironic.

357
00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:41.990
Right?
And then she's so don't you think,

358
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.840
<v 1>okay.</v>

359
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.880
<v 2>It's like the collapsing on you when you're working out.</v>

360
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.100
<v 2>It's getting you Paleo food.
And having no tampon.</v>

362
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.460
<v 0>It's one of those fucking stupid songs.</v>

363
00:21:58.461 --> 00:22:03.260
She remember when she was singing that song going,
hey,
hey ha.

364
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.570
When she goes down and you went to theater,

365
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.810
I remember I liked the song cause I liked the drums and shit.

366
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:13.870
And I remember listening to it in a fucking bar in this fucking chick just says,

367
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.730
do you like this side?
Even though it's a bar,
it's like I,
yeah,

368
00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:20.890
I know what it's about.
I'd say she's not singing about me.
You're fucking loaded.

369
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:21.724
Tick.

370
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

371
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.550
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
You have a glass of lemonade there.</v>

372
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.090
Oh Jesus.
Don't get me started with that fucking album.
Holy Shit.

373
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

374
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.080
<v 0>Anyways,
what the fuck was I talking about here?
Oh Yeah,
the gym,
the gym,</v>

375
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.430
the gym is on fire.

376
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.300
This has hopefully going to be done and the next couple of weeks,

377
00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:48.010
because as mentioned,
I'm sitting in the fucking writer's room and old Billy boy,

378
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.300
I'm maintaining,
you know,
it's funny,

379
00:22:50.301 --> 00:22:53.870
I'm actually eating great during the day and then I come home and it all falls

380
00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:58.380
apart because Nia is not here to say bill fucking ease up on the fucking drink

381
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.360
and eh,
uh,
you know,
I got those big ice cubes in the refrigerator.

382
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.250
I pour a couple of strong ones,
I'm feeling good.
Get off.

383
00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.630
Next thing you know,
I'm fucking sleeping like a Goddamn grizzly.

384
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.630
Wake up at three in the morning,
sweating on the couch,

385
00:23:14.631 --> 00:23:16.790
and then I go downstairs and I put on my pajamas.

386
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.640
That's basically what happens to be one of my fuck.

387
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:24.500
Well my why a wife leaves town,
you know,
Christ,
they fall apart.
Hey,

388
00:23:24.501 --> 00:23:26.690
who the fuck is,
I didn't think I bought this guy before,

389
00:23:26.691 --> 00:23:29.390
but Ryan Reeves on the blues,
Jesus Christ,

390
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.920
I don't believe they say he's six one two 30 something.
When he's out there,

391
00:23:33.921 --> 00:23:36.230
he looks like he's six five to 60

392
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.240
guys like the fucking hulk on skates.

393
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.120
He looks like an even bigger George La rock.

394
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.160
I love when he was like sort of backing into the boards and he just punches

395
00:23:47.161 --> 00:23:49.590
three different fucking stars right in the face.

396
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.500
Just sort of face wash is this guy a little jab for you?

397
00:23:52.501 --> 00:23:56.670
A is a fucking leave fucking,
you know,
shake you around like a rag doll.

398
00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:01.070
Then he blows a kiss to the bench.
That was shades of John when sync,

399
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.650
way back in the day when he challenged the whole,
um,

400
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.860
north stars bench as somebody to fucking step over

401
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.300
Jesus,
he looked like a fucking lunatic.

402
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:13.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

403
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.450
<v 0>You know what I mean?
He looks like that guy.
Like,
yeah,
it just doesn't,
you know,</v>

404
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.080
it goes to pick up a child and accidentally kills him.

405
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.290
There was a lot of guys I played in the Nhl in the 70s.

406
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:26.450
He just looked at him like,
you know,
Dave Schultz,

407
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.360
the fucking looks on their faces sometimes when they went out there.

408
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:32.270
Granted they had to do what they had to do,
but there's a lot of those guys,

409
00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.680
you know,
they,
they,
they really should have been in jail.
Um,

410
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.750
and I hate to say this,
but that,
that is what really attracted me to the sport.

411
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.090
It was always,
it was the fighting first.

412
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:48.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

413
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.500
<v 0>And for the,
for the life of me,</v>

414
00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:53.470
I don't understand why people have a problem with it.

415
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.533
You know what I mean?

416
00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.990
I hate when people talk about the purity of sport in the purity of competition

417
00:25:01.751 --> 00:25:04.420
and all of that.
It's just like,
just shot.
I mean,

418
00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:08.770
why don't you just fucking look up the chimney and wait for Santa Claus to come

419
00:25:08.771 --> 00:25:13.750
down?
You know what I mean?
Purity and sports,
the whole fucking,

420
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.780
the whole,
at least here in the United States,
I mean,
the whole fucking thing.

421
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:18.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

422
00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.690
<v 0>It's like that poor bastard we've got caught.
Was He smoking fucking dope?</v>

423
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.080
He's supposed to do that.
He's in college.
Right.
And then,
you know,

424
00:25:25.081 --> 00:25:26.760
he gets a couple of hundred bucks.

425
00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.770
He's playing for a team that's selling like 80,000 to 100,000 tickets a fucking

426
00:25:31.771 --> 00:25:34.140
week and he doesn't get to fucking nickels to rub together.

427
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

428
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.340
<v 0>And what,
what are the odds that he's actually going to make it?</v>

429
00:25:38.341 --> 00:25:41.010
Don't even fucking tell me,
oh,
he gets a free education.

430
00:25:41.011 --> 00:25:44.730
He doesn't have time to study.
He's got to study the fucking playbook,
right?

431
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

432
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.860
<v 0>That's slave labor,
man.
It's fucking,
they're all getting,</v>

433
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.530
they're getting fucked over.
I get some point.
They really got to do like the,

434
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:54.364
uh,

435
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.410
sort of like the college athlete behind the music.

436
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.160
Like,
and I'm not talking about the guys that made it then got fucked over,

437
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.920
you know,
with people's,
you know,
relative stealing their money.

438
00:26:05.921 --> 00:26:09.310
Just about all those fucking people that you just,
you went to school,

439
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.620
you didn't have time to go to class.

440
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.040
The team you were playing on was selling out the fucking arena.

441
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.870
It actually paid for the most of the buildings on the campus.
And then,

442
00:26:19.871 --> 00:26:23.930
uh,
you didn't make it.
And now go ahead and,
well,

443
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:28.030
now you're driving a fucking,
you some six foot 10 guy driving a bus,
you know,

444
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.820
driving the fucking Ava's shuttle.
They could have at least,
you know.

445
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.260
<v 1>Okay,</v>

446
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.900
<v 0>Sean up a little bit of money.
Do you understand me?
Just as a performer,</v>

447
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.980
all I could say is,
you know,
to go out there and fucking sell a thousand,

448
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.990
100,000 seats,
I can't imagine how much fucking money that is.

449
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.470
Can't imagine it and forget about all the fucking march,
all of that shit.

450
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.760
They can't kick the,
this guy's gonna,

451
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:57.250
they're gonna break this guy's balls over like 500 box.
Um,

452
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.870
I don't know.
I think it's bullshit,
but I'm also,
I'm also pretty jaded,
so maybe,

453
00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.410
maybe I'm,
I can do this right now.
Am I gonna fuck him retract again?

454
00:27:05.411 --> 00:27:09.250
Maybe I'm wrong.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Donald Trump's a great,

455
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.660
you know,
he's a great,
uh,

456
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.960
it's a great choice out of all the Americans out there that you could have

457
00:27:13.961 --> 00:27:14.980
picked,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

458
00:27:14.981 --> 00:27:19.200
Let's have Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton and fucking,
uh,

459
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.420
Barry Sanders coming up around the outside.

460
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:25.790
It's fuck's his name will not Larry Sanders,
Bernie Sanders.
Um,

461
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:32.110
oh.
What are you going to do?
This is just going to be a brutal eight years.

462
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.140
Hey,
how bout a Bama fucking killing it?
That's the second time he's done that.

463
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.400
He murdered at some other fucking banquet.
Um,

464
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.440
that time took the piss out of fucking Donald Trump.

465
00:27:48.441 --> 00:27:52.790
And some people are saying that's why Donald ended up running.
But uh,

466
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.520
I have no idea.
Maybe they just trying to blame him for the fucking nightmare.

467
00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.540
That is Donald Trump.

468
00:27:58.541 --> 00:28:03.340
I cannot fucking believe that there wasn't anybody in the Republican Party that

469
00:28:03.341 --> 00:28:04.390
could defeat this guy.

470
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.870
My only fucking thing as I watch Hillary go to the White House,

471
00:28:07.871 --> 00:28:11.980
then I'm going to with joy is watching him be a fucking asshole to her.

472
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.383
Um,

473
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.780
I just hope that he treats her the way he treated all the guys I want.

474
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:20.160
I want gloves off.

475
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.180
I want to bring it up fucking every skeleton they have.

476
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.340
That's going to be the only enjoyment then I'm going to get out of this cause

477
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:34.090
other than,
yeah,
it's a fucking travesty.
But Hey,
at least you know,

478
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.720
you can't say now that they don't count the votes because there's no fucking way

479
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.140
anybody have influenced once that guy,
there's no fucking way.
You know,

480
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.330
this is actually becoming personal,

481
00:28:43.331 --> 00:28:45.610
like the level with which then I'm fucking talking about this guy.

482
00:28:45.611 --> 00:28:49.840
So I guess I got to trash.
I got trash.
Hillary.
I've trashed her enough.

483
00:28:49.841 --> 00:28:53.960
Bernie Sanders,
the old man on the lawn,
right?

484
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.990
I Dunno.
So anyways,

485
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.190
I'm going to do a little bit advertising here and uh,

I don't have the advertising right now.

494
00:29:29.381 --> 00:29:32.770
So this is going to be a weird thing where now we have to stop and then it's

495
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.050
going to cut back on.

594
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:46.310
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

595
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.890
<v 4>hey,
what's going on
Monday morning podcast,</v>

596
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:41.260
but I'm going to be doing it my dentist fucking hybrid cause I got a ton of shit

597
00:36:42.521 --> 00:36:47.440
to do today.
Right out of the back.
You know this is going to be an edgy one.

598
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.130
Scares me a little pollen in my throat.

599
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.370
My car looks like shit.
I'm getting it fixed this week,
getting a dent taken out.

600
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:05.340
It cost me 800 bucks,
which my insurance company,

601
00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:07.230
but all they're going to do is charge me more money,

602
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.830
which really makes you wonder why the fuck he have insurance.

603
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.700
Insurance is one of the biggest scams out there.
In fact,

604
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:19.470
I remember a long time ago buddy of mine was working in insurance when I first

605
00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:21.660
started realizing what a fucking scam it was.

606
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.490
I was living in Boston at the time and he said to me,
he goes,
Bill,

607
00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:30.600
what are the two tallest buildings in Boston?
And I was like,
God,

608
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:35.580
the John Hancock building and the Prudential Center.
It goes.
Exactly,

609
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.260
exactly.
Do you think they're paying out fucking money to people than not?

610
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.000
You know,
we meet,

611
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.480
go watch that fucking spike Lee thing on New Orleans.
Um,
all right.

612
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:51.600
Jesus Christ.
Let me ordering people around.
Um,
anyways,

613
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:55.190
I got a lot of questions and advice last week when I was waiting for that

614
00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:59.790
plumber to come fix my stinky sync.
And um,

615
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.550
a lot of people,
first of all want to know if the plumber ever showed up well.

616
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.180
Well first,
let me give you the backstory here.

617
00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:08.040
For those of you who didn't listen to her last week,

618
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.290
I'll give you a little bit of last week's episode.

619
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:15.150
Like one of those old Batman TV shows from the 60s.
Uh,
last week,
uh,

620
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:20.180
plummer was supposed to come at 9:00 AM to look at my sink because for some

621
00:38:20.491 --> 00:38:25.491
reason the water coming out of the spout of the Faucet,

622
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:30.060
um,
smells like swamp ass.
I don't know why.

623
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.700
Started vaguely smelling like shit.
And as the weeks progressed,

624
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.660
all of a sudden it was just,
it was disgusting.

625
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.090
It's not like literally a slumped mount,

626
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:44.770
like an APP that was dipped in a swamp after somebody.
Joe.
All right,
let's not,

627
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.170
let's not get too disgusting.
It's not terrible.
Right?

628
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.520
So this mother fucker was supposed to show up at 9:00 AM

629
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.730
when I started doing my podcast,

630
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:57.280
I believe it was about 10 oh three not to get anal,

631
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.870
that's trying to get anal here.
But uh,
yeah,
he still hadn't showed up.

632
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:06.400
So basically,
you know,
I was trashing him.
I was trashing other plumbers,

633
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:09.850
the entire art of plumbing.
I was trashing.
So a lot of people ask me,

634
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.600
because at the end of my podcast,
the guy had not shown up.

635
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.030
And Long Story Short,

636
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.220
about 20 minutes after my podcast,
um,

637
00:39:20.221 --> 00:39:22.780
I had to do something that people do in a bathroom.

638
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.480
So I went in there and God damn,
and I did because I'm a fucking American,

639
00:39:28.481 --> 00:39:30.100
wouldn't,
Ya know,
one,
two,

640
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:34.240
three minutes after I finished doing what is my God given,

641
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:39.241
right as a fucking American with a bathroom that I pay to use the fucking knock

642
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:44.680
at the door.
Who is it?
The goddamn plumber.
And I'm like,

643
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:48.600
you gotta be shitting me.
Okay.
I didn't light a match.
There was no incense.

644
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.970
I didn't burn a newspaper or a fucking,
you know,

645
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.290
been let it trashcan on fire.
You know,

646
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.870
like I was going to sink some Doo wop with three of my other friends.

647
00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:04.650
It was just been,
they're all natural and uh,

648
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.480
I dunno,
I just panic for half a second.

649
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.300
Then I just hit this moment of then like,
you know what,
I don't give a fuck.

650
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.090
So he comes walking in after already finding out that,
uh,
you know,

651
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.250
reading this little report that I said my six smelt like swamp ass.

652
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.600
And he comes walking in there and I'm thinking maybe,
maybe I'll be lucky.

653
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.550
Three minutes has gone by.
I eat a pretty healthy diet.
Maybe,
uh,

654
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.440
maybe the smell left and whatever.
And he walked in,
said,
he goes,
Jesus Christ.

655
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.470
He goes,
is that the smell coming out of the sink?

656
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.190
And the old me would have panicked at that point,
but I didn't.

657
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.060
I just hit him with straight up honesty.
Hey listen.
I said,
listen man,

658
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.620
I gotta be honest with you.
You know,

659
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.780
you're supposed to be here an hour and a half ago.

660
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:54.700
I didn't think he was showing up.
So I took a dump and the guy,
he goes,
oh,

661
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:59.320
no worries.
No worries dude.
Just shrugged it off.

662
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.680
You know,
like somebody on the vice squad seeing a body,

663
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.880
you think smelling a little bit of shifts enough to scare a fucking plumber.

664
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:11.400
I've got news for you because I lived at last week.
And anyway,

665
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:16.360
it's turned out to be,
I had this filter on my,
on my sink,

666
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:22.960
I get some bacteria had built up and Yada Yada Yada.
What the fuck?
It's all good.

667
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:27.540
So,
uh,
so the guy didn't show up and uh,

668
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.260
there was a potentially awkward moment that I diffuse must speak.

669
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:35.260
He always got to go with honesty even when it's uh,
uh,

670
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:39.740
discussing one and wow,
that was just one big shit joke story wasn't it?

671
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.310
But um,
I actually got a lot of advice,
a one for my uh,

672
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:49.040
particular plumber and he was saying he hit some people out there in case your

673
00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:54.050
Ra,
the water coming out of your faucet smells like swamp ass.
Okay.

674
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:56.510
If you have a filter on there,
change that.
Got them filter.

675
00:41:56.511 --> 00:41:58.490
Cause that might be if,
and if not,

676
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.380
this plumber says sometimes it's easy to change the whole faucet when you're

677
00:42:02.381 --> 00:42:06.530
dealing with that kind of smell.
Stay away from the home depot faucets.

678
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.700
The plastic in them eventually cracks and leaks from somewhere.

679
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:15.440
I like wolverine brass,
but anything with brass internal should be fine.

680
00:42:15.441 --> 00:42:20.270
So they could go you like that?
You knew what to my podcast,
this is what I do.

681
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.370
I tell stories in my life that,

682
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:26.990
and it invariably end up being a big ship joke story and uh,
you know,

683
00:42:26.991 --> 00:42:29.900
people listen to them and then I get information,
I try to pass it onto you.

684
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:30.470
Then he'd go,
that's,

685
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:35.300
that's from an actual plumber who was also upset that the plumber didn't show
up.

686
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.450
Because I hate when people do shit like that.
Right.

687
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:42.920
I know why it gives him a bad reputation.
Evidently this is one of the good ones.

688
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.460
You know,

689
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.960
Kinda like one of those by the book crops that you see that 20 minutes into the

690
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:51.860
movie have to turn in their badge if they continue to work the case and then

691
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:56.150
they solve it using extreme force,
you know,

692
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.610
doing billion dollars worth of damage to the city

693
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.460
fucking skyscape or whatever the hell you call it.

694
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.360
What the hell do you call that skyline?

695
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.880
Skyscape I really am an asshole.
So they go,
yeah,
seven down.

696
00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:14.900
What you want to use a,
you want to use some breath?

697
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.530
He said something about measuring the spread between the,
the uh,

698
00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.780
the nozzles on the faucet and that's some shit I'm going to,

699
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:26.540
I'm going to remember to say that next time I go into a hardware store because

700
00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:28.940
he said I might get fucked over if I walk in there and look in the way.

701
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:33.941
I do like a squeaky clean comic who takes a dump in a bathroom five minutes

702
00:43:34.251 --> 00:43:37.610
before the plumber shows up.
It's not my fault.
He was late.
All right,
here we go.

703
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.010
So anyways,
if you knew one of my podcasts,
like I said,

704
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:44.870
I give information about upcoming gigs.
Don't take a left in front of me.

705
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.730
Yeah,
yeah.
Welcome to America.

706
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:51.930
We wait for the other guy two weeks now,
but there is a right away La.
Okay.

707
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.150
Jesus Christ.
Let me get through this part here.

708
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.500
I'm trying to navigate through traffic here.
Yeah,
I answer.

709
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.210
People send me questions.
Um,

710
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.660
they might have about anything from a,
when's your next gig too?

711
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.780
How do you fix the sink,
which I pass onto one of my 15 listeners.

712
00:44:11.781 --> 00:44:16.370
I'm up to 1515 listeners.
One evidently of whom is a plumber.

713
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.890
So if you have any questions,
just email them to me.

714
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:24.310
Please tell people about this podcast so I can get the number up over 20 and uh,

715
00:44:24.741 --> 00:44:27.590
and that's it.
So first off,
let me hype what I've got coming up

716
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:34.200
the next episode up uninformed with Joe de Rosa.

717
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:39.260
My radio show with Joe to Rosa on Xm two o two is going to be a this Saturday

718
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:44.310
night.
Well I think it's the Saturday,
May 24th.

719
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:49.370
I don't have a calendar in front of me.
Um,
May 24th,
uh,

720
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.500
it's going to be on Xm two o two from 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM we have a anger

721
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.890
management therapist coming in and those of you who listened to our show

722
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:00.960
realized that me and Joe Yell at each other a lot.

723
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.580
We tend to call each other cunts and we're trying to do a little less of that on

724
00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:10.680
the show.
So whatever the lady came on,
it was a great show.

725
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:16.170
And a Joe also recently split with his longtime girlfriend,
so he had a lot of,

726
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.550
a lot of pain.
Let it tear shed.
So anyways,

727
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:22.810
listen to what XM two o to the uninformed show.

728
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.990
May 24th 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM with bill burr and Joe to Rosa.
All right,

729
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:33.750
there you go.
And as far as upcoming gigs go,
um,

730
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.490
I'm actually coming back to New York for one day this week we're going to be one

731
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:41.520
of the comics on Jim Norton standup show on Hbo,

732
00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.510
going to be doing 10 minutes of comedy and a that's going to be showing in

733
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.390
airing in September,
I believe.
So,
uh,

734
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:53.970
I'm actually this week trying to figure out what 10 minutes I'm going to do.
Um,

735
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.600
and other than that,

736
00:45:55.601 --> 00:46:00.601
I'm going to be a Caroline's comedy club on May 29th through June 1st Charlie

737
00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:06.580
Goodnight's June 5th through the eighth and June 19th through the 21st I'll be

738
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:08.790
at the punch line in Atlanta.

739
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.570
All of the takes I have up on my site except for the ones that I haven't put

740
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:15.900
down yet because I'm disorganized.
And then you'd go

741
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.930
anyways,
back to the podcast here.

742
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:24.130
I want to thank everybody who came out to see me at [inaudible] and I Chicago.

743
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.920
I went to a cubs game on Thursday and fucking sucked one of the best ballpark

744
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.210
there ever was.
And every time it's like a fourth time going to a game out there.

745
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:38.400
And every time I go out there,

746
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:41.580
I'm always out there in April and May because I'm either doing a college or for

747
00:46:41.581 --> 00:46:45.510
some reason that's when I get booked at xannies and I always go out there and

748
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:48.900
it's like fucking 40 degrees out and

749
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:55.730
there's barely any ivy on the wall and I feel like I'm at a bare skin just

750
00:46:55.741 --> 00:46:58.500
freezing my fucking ass off.
Turned the collar up on my coat.

751
00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:01.380
Like I'm going to commit a crime at a God damn baseball game.

752
00:47:01.381 --> 00:47:03.780
I'm wearing my leather coat with the fur inside.

753
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:06.840
Like come on Barney Miller and it got the baseball game.

754
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.360
I really feel bad for you people out there and Straub.

755
00:47:09.361 --> 00:47:12.450
We have such a beautiful city that was a school bus.

756
00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:17.980
I was a school bus.
It just went by and almost took my fucking arm off.
Um,

757
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.960
you know,
such a beautiful God city,
but that,
whether it's just that,

758
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:24.930
that Lake Michigan man,
it's like this is giant fan.

759
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:30.610
It's just pointed at that city constantly.
All right,

760
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:32.230
that went nowhere.
Whatever.

761
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.530
I went to a great baseball stadium and it fucking sucked because it was a,

762
00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:40.930
you know,
really sucked was where I was sitting.
It was just open.
Uh,

763
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.580
what'd he call aisle way in the new ballparks.

764
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.370
They wait until a stoppage of play before they let people walk by,

765
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:52.660
which I bitched about in the past because I never had the seats right behind the

766
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:56.500
aisle.
They fucking horrific.
I've never seen so much food.

767
00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.690
There's so many food and beer vendors.
What by every five fucking seconds,

768
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:07.990
I missed so many God damn place because,
because it was cotton candy guy,

769
00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.100
it's like 40 degrees out.
This guy's walking around with this big stick,
you know,

770
00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.220
you know how they do it.
They got like that,
uh,
you know,

771
00:48:14.221 --> 00:48:17.110
and they don't want you to steal a shopping cart and they got that big long pole

772
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:19.720
going up the top of it.
He's got one of those.
And on the end of it,

773
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.700
you've got all this fucking cotton candy.
All right?

774
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:28.360
It's like four feet across,
walking around like a fucking Hobo,

775
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:32.920
a diabetic,
Hobo,
and he keeps walking by.
Hey,
cut and candy.

776
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.810
It's like too,
nobody's buying cotton candy all write a fucking four year old,

777
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:39.580
buys it after he gets up at Ferris wheel.

778
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:42.820
No one buys it at a fucking baseball game when it's 40 degrees out.

779
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.810
Go get some pretzels
or peanut,

780
00:48:47.811 --> 00:48:51.910
some shit that fits you waste that are walking around like we don't see it.

781
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:53.830
It's fucking Tutti.
Frutti we see it

782
00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:00.230
can't be all right.
Here we go.
Podcast questions.
Uh,

783
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.930
do you enjoy living in Los Angeles or do you regret moving?
Well,

784
00:49:04.931 --> 00:49:07.360
as you can obviously hear from the joy of this podcast,

785
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:11.530
I'm having the time of my life.
Actually.
No,
I don't.

786
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.670
I don't regret moving out here.
I actually,
for the most part,

787
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:16.810
I love living out here.

788
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:21.370
Up until yesterday where I started to feel the beginning of the summer desert

789
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:25.720
heat and I got to admit I'm getting a little scared.
It's a,
like they say,

790
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:27.100
it's definitely a dry heat,

791
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:32.790
but it's a way to describe desert heat oven.

792
00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:38.350
Ask
as if to say like,
I don't know,

793
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.181
you're cooking something.

794
00:49:39.181 --> 00:49:43.450
He'd get your forearm too close to the oven and you just feel what it feels like

795
00:49:43.451 --> 00:49:47.380
to be a slowly roasted.
That's what it feels like it.

796
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.700
And I'm also into the environment,
so I very rarely use my air conditioner.

797
00:49:51.701 --> 00:49:55.150
So right now my victor Wooten tee shirt is stuck to my back,

798
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:59.260
but I'm going to plow through this here.
So no,
I don't regret moving out here.

799
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.120
It has been a great experience.

800
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:05.020
Definitely was an adjustment and I still own a place back in New York,

801
00:50:05.021 --> 00:50:08.950
so I have that little Linus blanket in my back pocket anytime.

802
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:09.970
I don't want to be out here.

803
00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:15.010
I'll fucking crush up my hybrid like an old tuna can and I'll recycle it and

804
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:17.120
I'll move back.
All right,
number two,

805
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.950
I know you like conspiracy theories,
so what's your take on John F.

806
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.930
Kennedy assassination,
do you think?
KILLED JFK?

807
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.140
I watched the mythbusters show one time.

808
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:33.170
They reenacted the magic bullet and we're actually able to recreate it.

809
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.073
<v 5>Okay.</v>

810
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.010
<v 4>Where are they?
Where are they really able to fucking recreate the magic bullet?</v>

811
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.200
<v 5>Yes.</v>

812
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.350
<v 4>Kind of easy to do that when he got a camera crew and fucking editing and all</v>

813
00:50:44.351 --> 00:50:48.240
that crap.
What do I think?
Um,

814
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.180
I think what everybody thinks.
I think,
uh,
you know,

815
00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:55.990
I think a lot more people were involved.
Um,

816
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.120
I dunno what,
what do I know?
I don't know.
I think,
uh,

817
00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.230
I think basically to become president,

818
00:51:02.231 --> 00:51:07.231
you got to get in bed with a lot of shady people and if you go into the office,

819
00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:10.400
you turn your back on them.
Um,

820
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:14.360
you're going for a ride in a convertible.
That's what I think.

821
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:19.680
I Dunno.
Obviously Oswald didn't do it or they wouldn't,
they,
they mean,

822
00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.160
or at least didn't do it by himself,

823
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:25.780
but they wouldn't have all that stuff ain't out on the top secret papers there.

824
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.160
God that I just sound angry,
ignorant,
you know,
I couldn't even say ignorant.

825
00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.010
All right.
I Dunno.
I don't know who the fuck did it,
but you know,

826
00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.400
Jesus Christ is fucking boss.
Go ahead,
go

827
00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:44.190
the hell are they advertising on the back?
L Kooky,
Kooky television.

828
00:51:44.191 --> 00:51:45.900
So I had to learn how to speak Spanish,
man.
It's,

829
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.860
it's the last fucking thing I do.
I sweat it.
God,
some of that Spanish TV,

830
00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.190
the women that are on it,
I,

831
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.070
some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life and they always got

832
00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:56.904
those fucking

833
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:01.470
like three inch stiletto heels on.

834
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:07.880
And what I love about Latin women is like you trust an American girl up like

835
00:52:08.341 --> 00:52:08.970
that.

836
00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.900
She looked like she was getting whored out and it's somehow on those Telemundo

837
00:52:12.901 --> 00:52:17.730
shows those girls are dressed like whores,

838
00:52:17.731 --> 00:52:22.710
but somehow they own it,
they own it and their vibe is more like,
yeah,

839
00:52:22.711 --> 00:52:25.080
I know I look good and you'll never get this.

840
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:30.530
It probably also helps that they always have some fat 45 year old sort of used

841
00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:36.120
car looking salesman host standing next to it and he's always giggling the way

842
00:52:36.121 --> 00:52:40.410
I'd be giggling if I was standing next to him except I wouldn't have a jet black

843
00:52:40.411 --> 00:52:44.700
mustache.
All right,
next question,
Bill.

844
00:52:44.701 --> 00:52:49.320
There were some corn ball names for comedy clubs.
Giggles.
Bananas,
Loony Bin,

845
00:52:49.321 --> 00:52:54.030
the funny bone.
If you owned a comedy club,
what would you,

846
00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:58.020
what would you name it?
Uh,
I dunno.
Slap happy.

847
00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:01.050
You know what?
I tried to give it a dignified name.

848
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:08.100
<v 5>Uh,
Winston's
and</v>

849
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.450
<v 4>elegant night of comedy and Hilarious.</v>

850
00:53:10.451 --> 00:53:13.290
I don't know what the fuck I would call it.
You know what the reality is,

851
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:15.300
is that there's no good name for a comedy club.

852
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:19.110
I'm trying to think of one punch line.
Punch line is a good one.

853
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:24.930
Giggles stinks.
I really takes any sort of credible credibility away from your,

854
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.650
like people are going to be putting their hands up like I'm one of those bad

855
00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:32.940
Asian horror movies.
Um,
or maybe the porno,
not the horn.

856
00:53:32.941 --> 00:53:37.140
I'll move Cornell.
Not the horror movies.
I can't even fucking talk.

857
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.300
Breathing in this.
God damn buses,
gas fumes.

858
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:45.270
I think I just invented a new genera film.
Cornell.

859
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:49.720
She was Hora and porn or not.
That's a fucking smudge film.
All right.

860
00:53:49.721 --> 00:53:52.770
Everything's been done.
God dammit.
I can't come up with an original idea.

861
00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.840
All right,
completely unrelated question,

862
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:58.170
but I was wondering what your favorite music is.
A,

863
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.020
what kind of you listened to Jesus fucking Christ.

864
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:06.650
Like I almost fucking slammed right into me.
Wow.

865
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.320
Matching that and his like died on my podcast,

866
00:54:10.321 --> 00:54:13.140
but I had like the energy to hit pound right before I died.

867
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.970
And so actually,
uh,
you know what,

868
00:54:17.971 --> 00:54:20.340
that would suck then I'd actually finally sell out a fucking club.

869
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.410
Jesus Christ.
That was so scary as fuck.
I forgot the question.

870
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.890
What are some of my favorite,
what am I listening to right now?

871
00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:33.300
I'm actually listening to Jimi Hendrix,
a band of Gypsies,

872
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:38.370
specifically that song machine gun,
which I really like.

873
00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.940
Google it.
Google it or whatever.

874
00:54:41.941 --> 00:54:46.880
Youtube and I watched Jimmy play it.
Please don't watch John Mayer.
Okay.

875
00:54:46.881 --> 00:54:51.881
As he runs through the halls of his high school playing fucking Jimi Hendrix is

876
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:57.000
Dennis Miller mullet.
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck am I lashing out at him?

877
00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.860
You know why?
Because I'm trying to make a right turn.

878
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:02.280
The wind is blowing through my hybrid and it's blowing my little fucking sheet

879
00:55:02.281 --> 00:55:06.240
music.
But I like to call the podcast questions on,
on my lap.

880
00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.340
Wow.
I'm going to finish finish the rest of this podcast and my garage,

881
00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.630
like I'm going to commit suicide.

882
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.910
It's one of the great things about the hybrid is it's going to switch over to

883
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:20.910
electricity so I don't have to worry about the films,
which is actually,

884
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:25.270
I saw somebody do a bit about that.
All right.

885
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:30.930
And we hit the power button and it is off.
That's the great thing about a hybrid.

886
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:35.720
You literally shut it off like a fucking radio.
All right.

887
00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.540
Winding down if people stay with me.
All right,
number six.

888
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:43.980
Are you the same bill bird that was in the movie?
Passionata if so,

889
00:55:43.981 --> 00:55:46.980
what kind of part did you have?
I've never seen the movie,

890
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:50.850
but I saw that a bill burr was on the castless.
Yes,
that is me.

891
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:54.630
I wasn't that movie.
And I had a quick scene.

892
00:55:55.530 --> 00:56:00.530
I played a guy at a black check blackjack table with actually the guy who was in

893
00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:03.490
the movie.
The Patriot played the,
uh,

894
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:10.260
the general there I guess,
which was,
it was really over the top bad version of a,

895
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.740
I guess a red coat and people in England got upset about it because,

896
00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:20.550
uh,
because that's not who they are over in England.
You know,

897
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.950
I think if you've read a history book,

898
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:28.070
you look at the long wonderful line of diplomacy that has been England's foreign

899
00:56:28.621 --> 00:56:32.820
policy.
Um,
you can understand why they would get upset by the movie,

900
00:56:32.821 --> 00:56:36.810
the Patriot and why they're so upset with America and our foreign policy.

901
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:42.800
Because I know if any country out there would be upset by another country going

902
00:56:43.471 --> 00:56:46.590
in and invading a country and oppressing gets people who would be England

903
00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:52.200
because God knows they don't fucking stand for that shit.
Yes.

904
00:56:52.201 --> 00:56:55.980
This is dripping with sarcasm and this is coming from all the youtube videos.

905
00:56:55.981 --> 00:56:59.300
I see where you sit there and you see all these English people who were on that

906
00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:02.790
Goddamn high horse now because England,
so I can,
you know,

907
00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:07.380
fourth place around the world now they can act like a,
like the,
like,

908
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.360
they're like these fucking live aid people.

909
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.250
Let me tell you something to my one listener who's from fucking England,

910
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:15.930
if you hate America right now,

911
00:57:15.931 --> 00:57:19.080
the reason why you should hate us is because of plagiarism,

912
00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:24.860
because we stole your ideas and it's how we now have our world empire,

913
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:30.120
which will eventually fall.
And um,
all right,
take it up.

914
00:57:30.121 --> 00:57:31.500
You fucking high horses.
Okay?

915
00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:34.620
You guys have created more goddamned evil out there and we're just,

916
00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:37.020
you just pass the baton to us now.

917
00:57:37.021 --> 00:57:41.250
It's our turn to be evil and you guys are fucking fat too.
All right.

918
00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:43.650
I've seen that show.
You are,

919
00:57:43.651 --> 00:57:48.180
when you eat motherfuckers over there having pork chops and fry ups for

920
00:57:48.181 --> 00:57:50.130
breakfast,
you know,

921
00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:55.740
so go fuck yourself and uh,
go fuck yourselves and fuck man,

922
00:57:55.741 --> 00:57:59.940
United.
Got Damn Yankees of soccer.
All right,
there you go.
Wow.

923
00:57:59.941 --> 00:58:04.770
It's a little bit of anger there.
Okay.
Um,
not that I even give a shit.
Okay,

924
00:58:04.771 --> 00:58:09.560
so don't send me some bad message that ends with mate
in it.

925
00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:15.690
That's it.
I'm now back in my past.
And you like that.

926
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.520
You got to hear me walk up the fucking stairs.

927
00:58:17.521 --> 00:58:20.820
You've heard the garage door closed.
You really get let into my life here.

928
00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:22.890
This is like my own reality show,

929
00:58:22.891 --> 00:58:25.890
except it's not on television and there's no advertising money.

930
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:29.130
<v 6>Other than that,
I'm making a fortune.
All right.</v>

931
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.960
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
