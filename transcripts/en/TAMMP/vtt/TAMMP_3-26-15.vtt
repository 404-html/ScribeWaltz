6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.730

I am bringing back a,
a,
uh,

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.950
a popular guest.

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.780
We like to say here at the Monday morning podcast facilities,

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.480
which is basically wherever the hell I'm at.
I know where I'm at.

10
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:36.990
I'm somewhere in item and I'm going to say where I don't want people to know,

11
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:41.010
but people do know that this man is the King of New Jersey,
Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:45.750
the pride of Trenton.
Paul Versey.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.530
Back on the podcast.
And I am a up here and,
uh,

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.000
somewhere upstate New York because we're going to be doing a,
a benefit tonight.

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.860
Yeah.
Elevli live little.
These Allen there.
Levelly live.

16
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:00.070
We are northern Westchester.

17
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.600
We could leave it and then we can leave it at that northern Westchester County.

18
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.560
It's creepy as Illuminati neighborhood up here.
I was,
we,
we did,

19
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.380
we did the Tarrytown music hall last night
and,
uh,

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
afterwards I was driving up,
you know,
verse he gives me directions to his,

21
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:20.700
for his place and it was just fog.

22
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.710
No street lights in every three feet.
There was a sign about a deer.

23
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.790
That's how I like it except the deer because you know,
I hit a deer.
No,
I love it.

24
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.790
I love it up here.
But it would be nice if they got street,
all this,

25
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.110
all this blood money up here from all these pieces of Shit bankers that worked

26
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:41.700
down on Wall Street and,
and,
and,
and these boys,
the Smith Barney's of the world,

27
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.080
they can't get street lights.

28
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.900
You know why the vampires corporate sand pipes of corporate franchise,

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.870
natural bill,
they're trying to keep going with,
they're trying to do yes.

30
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.370
Natural in the woods.
You know,

31
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.190
Deon supposed to be here on street lights when you're talking about maybe do you

32
00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:59.970
lit it up,
they just stare at that instead of running out in front of your car.

33
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.180
Dude,
it was so scary.
Driving home last night.
One of those things,

34
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.700
like the fog was so thick,
you're not supposed to put on your bright lights,

35
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:08.370
which you probably,
you probably don't know that in fog.

36
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:11.050
You don't put on your bright lights.
Now you can't hear it makes it worse.
Yeah,

37
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.520
I know that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do to George Stephanopoulos.

38
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.130
I got to talk about that.
I've got a dog that we got.
We got back up.

39
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:24.300
We got to tell her that we had one of the sickest weeks ever.
So,
um,

40
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.650
I'm doing the benefit,
the garden of dreams,
the garden of dreams.

41
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
It makes a gardener laughs.
It makes a,
you know,
underprivileged kids,
whatever.

42
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.150
They have a dream.
They make it come true.
It's a great charity.
I'm doing it.
See,

43
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.230
I'm doing it sad.
So the people at Msg,

44
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.340
they own a bunch of theaters around the country,
uh,
and they booked me in them.

45
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.110
And uh,
we both make money together.
So they call me,
say,

46
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.470
you want to do this benefit?
And I said,
hey,
why wouldn't I,

47
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.140
why wouldn't I have to?
All you guys have done for me,

48
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.280
so be in the weasel that I am.
I immediately,
you know,
I'm checking out there,

49
00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:58.970
the rain,
the rangers schedule and I'm,

50
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.240
I'm seeing that play in the king's on Tuesday night.

51
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.940
So I call one of the [inaudible] brothers,

52
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.890
the tough like fucking shoe,
those muscles.
Okay,
great.

53
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.030
So I call up,
uh,
I'm texting with Steve and I just say,
hey man,
it,

54
00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:16.810
is there any way if I come in early,
you know,
the Rangers got a game.

55
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.380
Is there anywhere,
if when they're done with that practice,

56
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:24.440
if I could throw on a pair of skates and just do a couple of laps around the

57
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.100
Madison Square Garden.
Nice.
And he goes,
dude,
let me get on that.

58
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:28.570
Let me see what's up.
Next thing you know,

59
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:32.500
cause he's a [inaudible] from a lineage of Chris,
Steve,

60
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.710
look the Hanson brothers,
except they're not,
they're not stupid.

61
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.440
They get shit done.
Right.
And what's his other brother's name?
So Matt,
yeah,
Matt.

62
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.410
Great Guy.
So,
uh,
he calls me back.
Next thing you know,

63
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:49.150
we got a pick up game and we're playing in a x rangers.

64
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.080
Yeah.
X rain ranges out there.
Um,
hang on one second.

65
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.280
I got to justice level here.
Um,
and yeah,
next thing you know,
we're out there,

66
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.870
we're playing on the ice laid law.
Oh my God,
that guy was hilarious.

67
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.170
The guy was hilarious.
And Brian Mullen,
Brian Mullen.
Yeah.
Part of the uh,
the,
the,

68
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:11.490
the royalty of the Mollen Fam Joy Mullen.
Uh,
and Brian,

69
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:13.150
I believe two of them made,
I think three of them.

70
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:16.640
One of them made it I think up for a minute.
That's just insane dude.

71
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:19.330
When you come from a family where like two or three people,

72
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.940
that's why no one will ever beat the solder brothers is Sutter.

73
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:25.690
Buttes had seven brothers all made it to the NHL and at one point I think they

74
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:27.560
will all playing.
Yeah.
And at the,

75
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.490
I think there was like 24 teams in the league and you've got seven brands.

76
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.720
Like the Molina brothers had three catchers catching the bigs for that,

77
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.340
which is pretty incredible to have three catchers.
But uh,

78
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.960
so we're all dressed like we're doing crash test dummy shit and these guys don't

79
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:47.440
even have helmets on and that,
which is really dangerous.
Like,

80
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.350
cause he know I said to him,
I said,
I said at the time I was like,
dude,

81
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.630
you're going to go out there with us hacks with that sticks dude.

82
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.540
You gotta be careful.
He was fine dude.
That guy,

83
00:04:55.541 --> 00:05:00.541
his ability to position his body because he kept fucking with me for some reason

84
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:03.930
right out of the gate that I loved you too.
That's had it.

85
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.240
He had it out for you guys that fake fight or you throw the gloves down.

86
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.310
Then he went down in the ground and he was joking.
I tripped him.

87
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.560
I got him one time.
I just go here.
Here's birth slap shot.

88
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.220
He's just joking like I loved you dude.

89
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.490
I know you get a perfect impression of my awful one time.

90
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.540
I was doing my one timer.
Uh,
but you know what I ended up scoring.
Yeah he did.

91
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.570
I did on a goalie too.
So accounts in my world.
You know what's funny?

92
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:29.950
I was trying to go five hole and it actually client off the but the left post I

93
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:31.490
just played it off like they even know file.

94
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.480
That's how much a non hockey between the legs,
between the legs.

95
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.810
I just tried to put it on net and I figured at some point,
yeah,

96
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.310
if I have 200 shots,

97
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.010
I mean one of them's got to go and you take the biggest hack in the world.

98
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.110
It takes two and a half court shots.

99
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:47.020
At one point it's going to go off the back board and through the ramp.

100
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.530
I can't believe me.
And you ran into each other before anything started?

101
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.270
Just I know and I went down.
You stayed up?
I almost went down.
No.
Did you go down?

102
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.790
I wobbled dude.
Our cages like the cage hit and my head was on wall.

103
00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:02.920
That was my fault.
I wasn't looking.
I felt bad about that.
You know,

104
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.440
if I do what you got to get to when we went to the game,

105
00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:07.350
we've got to get to the George Stephanopoulos.
All right,

106
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.270
so for you guys that don't know,
I'm bad with directions,
is that fair to say?

107
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.300
Yeah,
I would say it's fair to say when you get lost in Manhattan,

108
00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:16.750
in the fucking streets and the number,
but I'm not good with directions.

109
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.640
Never was.
But bill here,

110
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.720
your beloved host is horrible with names,
right?

111
00:06:22.721 --> 00:06:26.350
Like messes names up of of players.
Be like,
dude,
I'm telling you right now.

112
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.510
I'd be like,
just going to help me remember for so long.

113
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:31.840
He's going to many Rivera.
I go,
dude,
who are you talking about it?
It was,

114
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:35.590
it was Mariano Rivera.
So we're at that were at the hockey game.
Amazing seats.

115
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:39.040
They hooked us up with like we're right there at the bench and uh,
you know,

116
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:40.810
there's all celebrities nearest and stuff,
you know,

117
00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:44.590
it's like drunk and I'm yelling at title at all.
Sam,
you saw do,
it's hilarious.

118
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.190
Hanks was there.
Sarah Jessica Parker.
You just see everybody,
right?

119
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.010
So all of a sudden you see all the steps and all of a sudden feel just go,

120
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.180
I have my head down because the guy poured me a vodka that was like a leader and

121
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.570
they'll just sit in there.
All of a sudden I hear it bro.

122
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.740
Bill just goes due to George Stephanopoulos to George stuff and I was right
here.

123
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.600
[inaudible] I look up and in one second I recognized that it was Jeff fucking

124
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:08.010
Gordon,
the race car with his wife and everybody.

125
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.800
The second is to go to any book,
Jeff Gordon and I just looked at bill.
I go,

126
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.340
George Stephanopoulos,
you're going do,

127
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.830
you can't tell me there's a resemble do they look alike?

128
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.840
I'm telling you right now,
someone's going to do it.
Somebody do this,

129
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.040
please send the splitscreen.
Yeah.
Oh,
they look or they could be brothers.
Uh,

130
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.690
Georgia's the older one,
right?
Do,

131
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.810
do you have a younger one who had no pressure?
What is,

132
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:37.270
he was always the younger one.
So he kept himself in better shape.

133
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:41.300
Maybe you got a better look at how good it is.
Jeff Gordon looked.
Oh my God,

134
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.170
thank God he was so dreamy.
That guy was just like,
what are you talking about?

135
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.450
What do you mean guys?
Like wasn't got 50 Jeff Gordon.
Is it,
you know,

136
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:53.990
it's funny.
I have no idea.
I know I'm way older than he is though.
Oh,
I mean,

137
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:56.640
I don't remember like I was winning titles when I was in high school.
He's just,

138
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.560
maybe I'm thinking your driver's license at 16 I mean those guys go out.

139
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.650
They start to stock car racing.
You know what?
16 and a half maybe.

140
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.450
I'm thinking this guy's older than he is a race.

141
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.350
Those ghost car Golkar things around the 23rd he looked like a 35 year old man

142
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:13.340
in shape.
The average agent stock cars like 18 oh,
okay.
All right,

143
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:15.890
so then you know what?
He's probably in his forties my bed,
dude,

144
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:20.690
he's probably like 29
no.
Yeah,
there's no Jeff Gordon.

145
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:22.310
There's no way Jeff Gordon out what it is,
what you want,

146
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:24.620
but to breathe in all that exhausted and wrinkles up you face when I'm telling

147
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:28.880
you it's 2029 it wasn't out of shape.
Doll crushing it,
dude.

148
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.560
The average age is not 17 what?
Stock car?
They don't start without.

149
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.423
I'm just fucking with you.

150
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.380
Do Dale Earnhardt Sr rest his soul that did was racing cars when he was before

151
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.720
he went.
I know they're doing that,
but I'm saying you don't make it to the,
to,

152
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.230
to the shell,
Paul.
Oh,
to the big,
you know,
we don't make it to the Daytona 500.

153
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:47.280
I haven't seen it actually happen.
No idea what I'm talking about.

154
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.210
That I'm never going to be able to watch good morning America or see George

155
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.800
Stephanopoulos his face without bursting out laughing.

156
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.160
I don't understand how he went from a serious on the other side of the,

157
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.360
of the podium being like,
uh,
the uh,

158
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.960
accidentally sent off a missile today that landed in a fucking school yard.

159
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.690
Right.
And now he like interviews Justin beaver.
Yeah.

160
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.640
Like that's a hell of a transition.
Now what he thinks,

161
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:12.300
what's winning things more impressive,
what he did or what?
Um,
um,

162
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.230
the guy with the big gap between his teeth and not Richard see stray.

163
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.650
Stray a strand.
Yeah.
By far I think it was,
yeah,

164
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:24.370
because I think straight hand came from a world of,
you know,
world string.

165
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.270
It came from with this world of athletes.
And here's,
here's the other thing,

166
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.530
straight.
How many hall of fame athletes can get that main stream?
I mean,

167
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:36.360
Michael Strahan does a good morning America dancing with this status live with

168
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:40.050
Regis.
I mean live with Michael and Kelly and Michael or whatever.

169
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:44.850
He took over that,
that thing.
And he's really good at it.
You know,
he's really,

170
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:47.160
really good at it.
Um,
I don't know.

171
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:49.590
I'm being biased to him because he was in the crowd.
Oh,
you're right.

172
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:54.270
He's 43 Jeff Gordon is 43.
I thought he was older than that.
Well,
you know,

173
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.690
I got to,
I got them by three years,
right?
Three years.
Yeah.
He's gonna be,

174
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.490
he's gonna be 44 in August 4th always a Leo.
Paul was crushing it.
Dot.

175
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.590
Like you could tell that dude,
he just came in with a jacket.

176
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.240
There's something about a race car driver.

177
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.900
They do have to keep themselves in great shape.
They have to stay like light.

178
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:13.410
You can't add weight to the fucking car.
He can't come in like a tub of shit.

179
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.800
Tony Stewart.
It's kind of like the,
he's kind of like the heavy guy,

180
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:20.430
but there's not many.
There's always that John Daly Guy in every sport there is.

181
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.590
There is except hockey really and have Negro.

182
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.630
If you find that as it as a hoop fan.
Yeah.
Now that you've played hockey,

183
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:32.040
what's so hilarious about Paul Versey is he has skated like five times in his

184
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:35.700
life and the fifth time he skated at Madison Square Garden.
Now Hey,

185
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.880
you're a New York fan.
What was that like?
Skating around looking up,

186
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.540
trying to find those New York and the championship.
Man,

187
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.900
that must've been half year ice time.
It was insane.
No seriously.

188
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:48.780
It wasn't saying there was one point where like when all you guys got off,

189
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.890
I went to the locker room,
I think me and Missoula,

190
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.890
his brother were out there alone and they dimmed the lights,

191
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:55.440
but the lights were still on the ice and I remember I was like,

192
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:56.670
I just need to take the sense.

193
00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:00.480
So I just did a lap around the garden with the garden empty and I'm looking at

194
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:04.200
all the black seats and I just looked up and I saw the Ewing and all that and I

195
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:07.260
was just like,
this is,
I really tried to soak it in.
That's all it was.

196
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:08.460
It was really cool man.
Yeah.

197
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:11.280
What I did was I tried to get to the locker room first because I wanted to be

198
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.310
the first dude in the shower cause I only saw one shower and I was like,

199
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:16.910
I'm going to be sitting there forever.
Yeah.
And I,

200
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.450
that's the one thing that weirded me out though.

201
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.550
Like just old guys just throwing their fucking,

202
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:25.170
just peeling their underwears off when they're sweating.
Like,
like dude,

203
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:27.780
seriously though,
like don't you have it in you to just keep,
I don't know.

204
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:29.310
Maybe it's all,
I've got to tell you something.

205
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.930
There's this 10 years between you and me and there's a big 10 years like,

206
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.860
like when I grew up,
when you took gym class that we were like animals,

207
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:40.690
we all went into the same fucking shower.
That was like a,

208
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.140
there was like three sections of the shower with like,
you know,
five,
uh,

209
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.280
shower heads on each side.
I know.

210
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.280
And I remember the first time we were in sixth grade,

211
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.230
it was the first time we were all sitting at the little kids,

212
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:54.020
like we're all going to in the same thing.

213
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.200
And I remember like the first week of shout,
a of gym class,

214
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.770
most kids didn't shower because you were too nervous or shy or whatever.

215
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.620
And like five kids did it.
I remember mean this other kid,
his kid,

216
00:12:03.621 --> 00:12:07.460
dad bashner what a great fucking name,
right would die in laughing.

217
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.950
Everybody who didn't shower would die laughing,

218
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.650
watching their friends walked by Butt ass naked.

219
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.340
And then within like three gym classes,
it was completely normal.

220
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.300
Everybody did it and you need,
didn't even notice.
So I just,
I grew up like that.

221
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.710
Yeah,
I didn't do that in my school at all.

222
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:26.210
But as steam room when somebody does weirds me out because there's something

223
00:12:26.211 --> 00:12:26.800
about how it's,

224
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.920
it's this relaxing meditative thing and then all of a sudden there's somebody's

225
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.260
Dick and you're just like,
dude,
you're killing it for me.
Where did we go?

226
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.800
We went through a steam in Toronto and I walked away and like,
dude,

227
00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:40.920
I guess the dude was just,
I just flipped.
Dude's just bunk balls out.
He's like,

228
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.220
yeah man,
how's it going?
Like they just have no,
they have,

229
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.040
we were joking about like,
oh,
you were saying what's wrong with guys like that?

230
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:48.760
And the,
I'm like,

231
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.760
those guys are the straightest guys that defect that it doesn't even dawn on

232
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:59.200
them who is telling the story where the guy was talking to him and the guy had a

233
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:03.550
hairdryer outmost blow drying his ball.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
one,

234
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.510
one of my unacceptables on diversity affects,
somebody goes,

235
00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:09.540
I'm in the thing and the guy's just sitting there talking sports.
I think.

236
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.810
I didn't think I was just talking and it was just blow drying his dick and balls

237
00:13:12.811 --> 00:13:15.530
just like,
like it was nothing to do with that.

238
00:13:15.531 --> 00:13:18.390
And my thing about that is people like,
people think that's weird.

239
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:21.030
It's like that guy that is as heterosexual,

240
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.390
the fact that they wouldn't dawn on you,

241
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.170
you're just sitting there going like,
ah,

242
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.260
that's so the Barneys is blowing through his pew.
You know what?
Me and my friend,

243
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.510
me and my friend,
this is the one of the funniest things.

244
00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:43.650
I was still the funniest thing to this day and we used to laugh in highschool

245
00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:48.120
cry when an old man is at a urinal and he farts while he's pissing,

246
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.990
it's one of the funny own.
It's almost like it's,
they can't control it.

247
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.980
It's the second day just released to let to let them,

248
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.440
but there's something about it where they don't,
they're still older.

249
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.820
There's 60 or 70 they don't even smile and it's always,
it's,

250
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.150
it's always a baritone too.
Never,

251
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.720
never a high pitched one
did.

252
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.610
There's just something about an old man not giving a fuck.
That is the greatest

253
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.240
old men just don't care.
They don't care.
They announced what they're doing.
Yeah,

254
00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:24.940
I got to go down there.
They're the funniest dude.
Old Men are funny.
Dude.
I know.

255
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.200
What did you,
what year in your life do you think you tap out from giving a fuck?

256
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.450
Like what year do you think you're just,
no,
I actually,

257
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.540
I was actually talking to my wife about retirement and she's like,

258
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.300
you had in mind you're going to die on stage.
You're going to do this forever.

259
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.280
I say,
I might,
but I wanna.
I wanna plan like,
you know,
like look,

260
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.780
this is this weird thing with age I'm at right now.
I started 23 years ago.

261
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.140
All right.
I was 23 almost 24 now I'm 23 years later,

262
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:53.650
46 almost 47 in 23 I'll be 70 right,
right.

263
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.240
Do I really want to be,
I don't want to have to be doing it.

264
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.320
I don't want to have to be lugging my ass all.
You wouldn't have to what?

265
00:15:01.321 --> 00:15:06.321
What it's going to come down to is say a legend or the funny boats now,

266
00:15:06.481 --> 00:15:10.260
but would you be doing it for 50 years?
Please welcome.

267
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.920
We were talking about this the other day,
like
bags.

268
00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.300
Don Rickles is like in a wheelchair doing it now and it's like,

269
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.900
I think he loves it so much.
He still wants to talk and tell stories.

270
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.540
I think he loves it that much.
Right.

271
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.490
If you want to do it at 70 I mean Carlin rest his soul.

272
00:15:26.491 --> 00:15:30.450
He passed away at 71 and he was still doing it and I think of George Chrono

273
00:15:30.451 --> 00:15:33.600
lived to 85 he would have done it to 85 I really don't think you would have done

274
00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:38.560
it.
Like I would have just kept going with it,
but my thing is I want to,
uh,
if,

275
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.720
if I want,
do you have to take a Piss,
Paul?
No,
I can't burn another pizza.
Oh,

276
00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:45.780
the pizza.
Yeah.
I would say thank you.
You saved my house by the way.
Oh yeah.

277
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.190
Put my son.
My son used to go,

278
00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:51.120
I want pizza and I had a pizza in form and bill just add an order goes,

279
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.500
you want pizza?
And I go,
Oh yes,
there was a hockey puck.
Right.

280
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.780
He's making some digiorno homemade versus house here.
It's not delivered.

281
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.080
I hate that it's not delivery.
It's like,
yeah,
no shit.
It's a frozen pizza.

282
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.900
That's such genius marketing.
Whenever they,
yeah,

283
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.100
and if you've noticed in the last 10 years,

284
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:16.460
everybody who makes shitty food is always at now trying to do this thing where

285
00:16:17.401 --> 00:16:22.200
they have morons.
All right.
Who Wake up every day,
eight and frosted flakes.

286
00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:25.740
They sit them down at a,
at a table and they,
the first thing they do to mind,

287
00:16:25.741 --> 00:16:29.420
fuck them is they give them cloth napkins and then they sit down and they bring

288
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:34.170
them like olive garden or they bring them dominoes or they bring Digiorno and

289
00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:38.430
these people are blue.
All my God,
it's so decadent.
What is this?

290
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.820
Believe it or not,
it's Dunkin donuts.
Are you theory?

291
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.690
I thought this was for my Boulos Yuri and Patty.
No,

292
00:16:48.691 --> 00:16:53.100
it's a fucking doughnut from down the street.
Oh,
look at this.
Me TV.

293
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.300
Oh,
Paul,
you got to see this man.
Rockford files is on right now.

294
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.730
You're a Firebird guy.
I,
I,
you know,
started whenever I used to watch this.

295
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:08.250
Look at that caddy chick pulling up red leather seats.
Red On red.

296
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.170
Look at her coming out noser place.

297
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.620
God Damn it.
I love to be living in the seventies I'm just kidding.

298
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:17.580
They were already bitching by then,

299
00:17:17.581 --> 00:17:22.440
throwing their hats in the air twirling around in Minneapolis who can turn no

300
00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.810
world on with her Claire,

301
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.480
who can take got another job suddenly make it all sema.

302
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.660
Well,
let you pitch in.
You should know it,

303
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.380
bitch it show it first is fuck it back.

304
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:47.380
He made up pizza.
You're welcome people.
Sorry man.

305
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.980
That was even bad for me.
Dude.
You're like,
you ever watched this Rockford files?

306
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.000
No,
he,
I never noticed this,
but he's not married.

307
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:59.910
He's got no kids and he lives in a trailer down by the beach.

308
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:04.200
He's really like a loser and his dad drives his truck like a,

309
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:06.990
I don't know what happened to him as a kid,
but he's got this sick ass.

310
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.270
Look at this gold file.
It's like a chain out.
He's got to right there.

311
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.840
That gold Firebird except body style you like.
You know it's funny,

312
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:15.660
as you were describing his life,
me being married with two kids,

313
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.670
I'm thinking to myself,
this guy's crushing it.
You're like,
yeah,

314
00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:25.560
he's got a trailer by the beach,
not married,
nothing else.
Firebird.
Oh my God.

315
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:28.170
Could go smoke a Cuban by the beach every night by himself,

316
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:31.440
without having a woman Gal and only knowing your mouth.

317
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.830
And he brings the same lawn chair that he uses his like his dinner table chair

318
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.190
just brings it right on to the beach.
It's perfect.
Is that,
gee,

319
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.050
that's not Jennifer Garner's father or grandfather,
is it?
Uh,

320
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.870
that's James Gunn on and look at this fire,
but at that Firebird,
that's fine.

321
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.690
He looked at me front end on it.
You're a Pontiac guy.

322
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.080
Paul Versey was one of the last Americans to buy a Pontiac.

323
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:56.970
Like when I first met you.
What are Nice Suv,
but you know,
like SUV.

324
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.040
Now if you ask me the name that I could never,

325
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.360
but you want to know the star fire and there was a window of the son of what's

326
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:06.180
called a torrent.
But you know why I got it torn.
You know what?
It got me,

327
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:08.670
you know what got me when I thought not the white on the outside.

328
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:10.980
I like the front grill.
But you know what really got me when I opened it,

329
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:14.360
it was cr cream leather.
You know how I like light leather?
No,
I like that.

330
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.120
And I go dude,
light leather with white.
I'm in.
And then the guy just got me,
you,

331
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:21.360
me and Stacy had no intention of buying it and I sat in it and I just looked at

332
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:24.410
the letter and I'm like,
it's not a bed.
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

333
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.210
Well that's my thing that's taught people.

334
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:28.290
I wasn't going to tell him I was going to get,

335
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.070
I'm going to get to 65 Ford Galaxy.
I'm gonna sit Dan Guy,

336
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.860
I showed you a picture of that car.
Right?
Oh that's beautiful car.
Yeah.
Yeah.

337
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.210
I want to get,

338
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.870
I want to have the white leather interior matching top and then some other sick

339
00:19:39.871 --> 00:19:40.704
ass color.

340
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.370
And then underneath it's just all 2015 I'll be able to drive it across country.

341
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.600
Um,
that's,
that's,
that's the game plan.
I just have to find,

342
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.920
I got to find an old one.

343
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.620
People keep telling me well by one that somebody already started to fix up and

344
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:55.940
it sits like that.
Cause there's always shit that they did to it that I don't,

345
00:19:55.941 --> 00:20:00.180
I'd rather start at ground zero.
Just find one that's straight body.

346
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.440
I think I want the black trans and what the gold bird on it.
Of course you do,

347
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:07.680
Paul.
I always said that about you dude.
You're right down main street.

348
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.220
Well what is your ham and Egger this,
this,
this.
There's no left turns with you.

349
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.340
It's not true.
It is.
It's not true.
I like Buicks and I'm probably,

350
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:17.250
the only thing missing in your house is a sign that says home sweet home.

351
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.010
I'm telling you,
if you don't think she's got that,
we got that.

352
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.340
Paul Versey got days America.
I think we got that.
Hey,

353
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.340
what about that Italian meal we had?
Oh,
just happy.
Yeah.

354
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.510
Giuseppe is a guy,
uh,
who is been,
he's from Sicily.

355
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:37.440
He's been in America 13 years and he owns a restaurant right over near,
um,

356
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.110
never been arrested right now.
You got to get that out there.

357
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:45.120
He made a homemade nilkie.
Oh my God.
Was it good?

358
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.190
Yeah.
You know,
like shit.
Oh,
this cat.
Yeah,
it's a big boy.

359
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.160
I get along with animals,
man.
People not so much animals like

360
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.580
you know what I like about animals?
They did.
They don't,

361
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.730
they don't feed me every once in a while.
Give me a little pat on the head.

362
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.820
You know Angela Lazada Comedian Angela was on it.
He was always a dog guy.

363
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:03.580
He didn't like cats,
so it was girl finally talked him into getting a cat.

364
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.040
All he does is post on Facebook,
pictures of his cat and I talked to,
I go,
dude,

365
00:21:07.041 --> 00:21:11.620
they're under already.
He goes,
underrated be in.
Although he says be,
I love that.

366
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:14.620
He still says be underrated.
Beat y'all.
What's that?
And he goes,
what's up?

367
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:19.290
Pop underrated be.
Yeah,

368
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.630
he stuck with it.
No,
there's nothing better than a cool cat.

369
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.240
My only issue with them,
I snuggled,

370
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.750
you're my only issue with cats is I don't like when they're done with you

371
00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:31.450
petting them,
why can't they just sort of shake you off?

372
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.110
They always get all of a sudden roll over in the back like Lightening Quick and

373
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:37.180
Dick Dick Clause in a little bit.
It's like,
all right dude.

374
00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:39.580
He could tell a cool and don't want to bother him.
That's why he was like,

375
00:21:39.581 --> 00:21:41.500
all right,
I could show what this guy,
he doesn't let you know.

376
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.630
The funny thing about cats is they fucking,
they,

377
00:21:43.631 --> 00:21:46.930
when they say they like tolerate you living with them,

378
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.460
which is the funniest thing,

379
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:51.520
like you feed them and bring them in and then they tolerate you.
It's like,

380
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:54.220
excuse me.
It's something hilarious.
Oh yeah,
no,
no,
absolutely.

381
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:59.110
Then dogs are totally codependent.
Needy do.

382
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.740
My dog is like,
it's like a psycho chick.
Like we go to leave it alone.

383
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:05.140
It's like freaking out.
Where were you?
Oh my God.

384
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:09.910
I had to tear up the entire living room,
not my dog.

385
00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:10.420
It's like,

386
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.450
it's like when are you going to understand that you're not being abandoned?

387
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.050
We come back.
All right,
next thing you know,

388
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:20.140
you're up on the couch and I'm giving you a belly rub and you fall asleep.

389
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.290
What is the problem?
Yeah.
Now because you know,

390
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.730
because probably because you didn't get it from a puppy.
I Dunno.

391
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.540
I Dunno what the deals was.
That dog.
All I know is I fucking love the dog,

392
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:36.520
so I'm stuck with it.
Things already like,
uh,
like seven years old already.

393
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.130
We got it.
And it's like a year,
year and a half when we got it.

394
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:41.940
So it's like she's,
she's only halfway there.
Do they go 14,

395
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.710
15 years now I'll do it the way I'm treating this dog,
this dog is,

396
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.780
and make it like 18,
and it's

397
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.520
changing the oil.
I'm baby this things that,

398
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.040
and this thing has very low miles on it.
I'd take it for a hike every day.

399
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.640
That's all I do is I,
I,
uh,
the things the best,

400
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:02.740
the only thing about that is she's going to need that every 10 now.

401
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.410
What do you mean?
Like you can never stop doing that hikes.

402
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.510
You're going to lose it if you do that.
Oh,
what's,
and then what's,

403
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:11.800
what's the downside that I stay in shape?
No.
Yeah,
that's true.

404
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.150
Um,
they still do commercials like this.
What's that?
Yeah,

405
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.160
it was just for old people.
Oh,
that's gotta be the worst dude.
When you,

406
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.380
everybody's moved out.
Whoever you're married,
died,
and now you're there.

407
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:27.480
Just thinking,
I hope I don't fall down.
It's going to be horrible.

408
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.670
That's like one of the biggest leads to them.
Dinah's I'm falling.
Oh yeah.

409
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.840
My 94 people is so unbelievably uncoordinated.
It's like,

410
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:37.060
haven't you been walking for like almost a century?
It's like,

411
00:23:37.061 --> 00:23:39.160
what is the problem?
All they need,

412
00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:42.190
dude is a throw rug and that like that could be cause of death.

413
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.100
Speaking to uncoordinated,
how hammered did we get two nights ago?

414
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.080
I didn't want to talk about it.
I was embarrassed.
Easily.

415
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.760
You held it together fine.
Oh yeah.
He held it together.
I yelled at all,
Sam.

416
00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:52.740
Uson too much,
dude.

417
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.290
I've been to sporting events with you or you were a thousand times more

418
00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:57.120
embarrassing when you started yelling at him.

419
00:23:57.121 --> 00:24:00.240
I thought when you started yelling at him in the first period,
dude,
you were,

420
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:04.740
I wasn't.
I would just,
I just kept going.
I kept going.
Oh Dude.
I was crying on me,

421
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:09.420
dude.
I was crawling.
Dog Acts like he didn't get no,

422
00:24:09.421 --> 00:24:11.790
he knocked him out.
You live by the sword.
You die by the sword.

423
00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:14.580
Just like the clip said.
No dude,
I was crawling in my skin when we went,

424
00:24:14.581 --> 00:24:17.520
but I stopped.
I stopped though because I finally was just like,
you know what?

425
00:24:17.521 --> 00:24:21.850
This guy could beat the living shit out of me and not even wrinkle is tying that

426
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.370
dolphins game.
You made me cringe.
You were the bangle fans told me to get on the,

427
00:24:26.371 --> 00:24:29.700
on the dolphins kicker.
You were so relentless that I literally had my head down.

428
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.080
You're,
hey,
you're good.

429
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.490
You weren't that poor guy was pacing.
No,
I got him to walk down the other side.

430
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.780
You got,
I saw.
I thought you might do that.
And I'm like,

431
00:24:39.781 --> 00:24:43.150
I don't think he's going to do that here sitting on garden because now you start

432
00:24:43.151 --> 00:24:46.730
looking at him though.
You kept looking at him every once in a while.
And uh,
we,

433
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.300
we went to wasn't even though was a dirty player,

434
00:24:48.301 --> 00:24:51.150
but then when it came time to fight anyone,
just turtle up.
It just,

435
00:24:51.151 --> 00:24:54.780
I mean it's just how do you look your dad and the,
I did do something like that.

436
00:24:54.781 --> 00:24:59.190
It's just the worst.
Ah,
um,
ah man.
Did it cut out?
Oh No,
this is,

437
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.500
I always think this happens to seize frigging headphones.

438
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.580
I feel like I ended up losing the recorder.

439
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.970
Do the battery life on this new,
uh,
I'm gonna give him a free plug here.

440
00:25:08.971 --> 00:25:12.810
This Olympus Ls,
whatever.
It's up to 17.
I just leaned down.

441
00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:15.510
I just had a total paranoid of the cat was going to scratch the shit out of my

442
00:25:15.511 --> 00:25:18.360
face.
You never know what these things.
He would never in a million years,

443
00:25:18.361 --> 00:25:23.340
he would know.
I know it him cats,
cats have the loyalty of like,
no,
he's great.

444
00:25:23.341 --> 00:25:27.150
He's a sweetheart.
The other walker,
he's good.
That's hilarious.

445
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.380
The way my friend,
he gets hookers.
Oh,
I've got a friend of mine.

446
00:25:31.381 --> 00:25:35.280
He likes street walkers.
You know?
Why would you see other day three walkers?

447
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.170
I was thinking that the other day.
How many different names that are for that?

448
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.980
Streetwalkers hilarious prostitute,
hooker,

449
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.110
streetwalker whore,
whore.
Who were harlot?

450
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.650
What was the one?
One.
One of Kevin's friends.
Don't make stomp it.
No,

451
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.720
something like that.
That's ridiculous.

452
00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.470
That actually seems like that almost doesn't make it sound bad.
Yeah.

453
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.890
I have to look that up to him.
I'm probably saying it wrong.
Strumpet now dude.

454
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.860
Paul,
I can't believe we're playing again today.
I can't believe a,

455
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.320
I can't believe a,

456
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.000
<v 1>okay,</v>

457
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.440
<v 0>hang on a second.
I gotta look that up.</v>

458
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.420
I can't believe that I can play hockey again today.

459
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.700
Look at that structure at crossing the street.
I can't believe it.

460
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:24.040
Like an abandoned your your beautiful baby boy.
Oh look,

461
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.760
he's an angel up during this pepperoni pizza watching cartoons.
That's it.

462
00:26:27.761 --> 00:26:30.310
Stop it.
Here we go.
Is it stomp it?
Yeah.

463
00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.260
This is probably like some fancy definition.

464
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.480
It's a fancy trumpet made out of gold.
Stomp it.

465
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.910
A definition of strap prostitute.
Wow.

466
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.950
Stomp it on of origin.

467
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:48.951
Another term for who were first used by Shakespeare to describe loosed women.

468
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.940
Dude,
that's fucking ad.
Then we went down the block.
I picked up a couple of man.

469
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.650
Yes.
Jampie its

470
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.830
gift to Gab.
Drump it.
Well listen,

471
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:08.030
this is actually a few,
if you're new to this,
um,
podcast,

472
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.430
I'm starting to do these every Thursday where I just sort of bang out a half

473
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.440
hour and then we,
uh,
we play some greatest hits.
So,
because Paul Versey yeah,

474
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.630
Paul Versey is here.
Uh,
we actually have,

475
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:23.490
you're a classic clip from the time machine.
What would you,
what not,
don't,

476
00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:25.080
don't ruin it,
but if you haven't,

477
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:27.420
if you missed that episode or you're new to the podcast,

478
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:32.421
I was traveling with Paul through the frozen Tundra of Canada a bunch just about

479
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.500
a year ago.
Hello?
Halau knock knock.
We,
we,
like you said,
we,
uh,

480
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.040
we ran out the winter there,
right?
We wrote out the winters in Canada.

481
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.390
This is the almost a year.
Yeah.

482
00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.100
And it brought what brought my hockey shit up there.

483
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:48.960
We skated on the canal there in Ottawa,
not knock.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

484
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.540
Knock knock.
We,
this tour manager,
she would do that.

485
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.260
We would be sitting in the green room talking and she'd be like all the way down

486
00:27:55.261 --> 00:27:59.970
the hall and just go knock,
knock.
Hello.
But it never knock.
Never.

487
00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:01.860
That's the funniest thing.
Knock her.

488
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:05.070
Announcing those zero excuse to just interrupt the conversation.

489
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.120
That was a lot of fun.
That uh,
what would you do?

490
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.410
What do you mean the time machine time machine before 1900.
Oh yeah.
Say So.

491
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:18.060
Basically spinning off here.
Uh,
so basically as you know,
people always say,

492
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.180
if he had a time machine,
what would you do?
Would you go into the future?

493
00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:24.900
Would you go to a period during your life wants you have to go before 1900 and

494
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:26.730
stay?
Oh,
you had,

495
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.520
the question was if you had to go in a time machine and you had to go before the

496
00:28:29.521 --> 00:28:33.540
1900 and stay,
where would you go?
That was what the question is.
Christ.
Yeah.

497
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.320
Yeah.
I think I said I'd go to 1900.
No,

498
00:28:37.321 --> 00:28:40.380
you said you would go to the 18 hundreds and don't

499
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.900
make the clip pointless.
I'm so fucking ridiculous.
I don't remember what I said.

500
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.960
So anyways,
we're doing this side,
this benefits and I do that.

501
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.970
How great was a Tarrytown last night?
Oh,
it was great.
Tarrytown musical.

502
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.120
It's one of the great theaters in this country.
So much fun.
And I was asking,

503
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.480
I was saying like,
man,
does anybody ever taped this special here?

504
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.080
And they were like a Jim brewer taped the specialist.
Like,
Oh yeah,
that's right.

505
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.860
[inaudible] Trevor Noah,
Trevor Noah.
Just did one there.
Okay.

506
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:08.940
And Lamp Annelies doing one this weekend,
which I'm sure is already sold out.

507
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.880
Yeah.
Now it's just like the,
it's the,
I dunno.
It's got this,
it's cool.

508
00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:15.000
It's got the magic in there,
Paul.
It does.
Some places have the magic.

509
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:19.860
That place definitely does.
Um,
had a great time there last night,

510
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.850
ended up.
Um,
so there's no point in driving all the way back to the city.

511
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.511
Actually,

512
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:28.980
there was a great point because it was a longer drive to where I have a place in

513
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:31.940
the city compared to where the fuck you live now.

514
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.740
You just didn't know how to get up here.
You didn't know how to get up here.

515
00:29:34.741 --> 00:29:36.110
It was foggy.
And you,
and I tell you,

516
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.110
telling me that my gps doesn't know how to do it.
No,
you're looking at the GPS.

517
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:43.030
You're going slow.
It's foggy or worried about going slow.

518
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.490
Moodley no,
no,
no I did.
And I'll tell you why because I said in my head,

519
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.280
Versie already hit a deer.
So right there,

520
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:54.010
what are the odds that I'm also going to hit the deer cause I'm going to the

521
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:56.900
same place where he lives.
It's done for a while for,
you

522
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.910
know what I did was I got behind this maniac and one of those dodge ram trucks

523
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:06.730
that was driving crazy.
So I just drafted behind them.
I'm like,

524
00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:09.220
there's no way a deer is going to be fast enough to get between me and this

525
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:12.910
truck and uh,
if he hits it,
he's just going to see,

526
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:13.840
here's what he's going to hit it,

527
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.730
slam on the brakes and I'll plow into the back of him.

528
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.110
People who live in West Chester go to short and West Chester,
I was a smart one.

529
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.730
I said,
let's keep driving up.
And I got this,
I got the better schools.
This is,

530
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.030
this is,
you know,
this is country money up here.
I got lucky with this house.

531
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.830
This is country money up here doing good.
Everybody going overseas too far.
Paul,

532
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.290
he realized how much the property value is dropped since you came here.

533
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.440
And that's the one thing with like real estate is really going to hurt you.

534
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.520
The second you buy it,
you lose money because you own it.

535
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.250
Once the world sees your face,

536
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.440
how's sold,
and then they got a picture of you.
I know,
I know.

537
00:30:54.441 --> 00:30:57.820
I'm the your wife and kids.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
All right.

538
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:01.650
But you are such a shit show.
You know,

539
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.860
you're still guide them sensitive.

540
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.540
I knew halfway through that you couldn't roll with that.

541
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:07.780
You are not because we talk about it then drop him off.
I knew it.

542
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.570
I knew it though.
Yeah.
Hilarious.
Don't you are shit.

543
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:15.990
You are the easiest guy to get in.
What's funny about use,

544
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.750
you always try to play it off.
Like,
uh,
you'll,
you'll just say like,
Jesus,
Paul,

545
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.170
you gonna wear that shirt tonight and you're like,
yeah,
fuck you.
This looks good.

546
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.940
And I swear to God,
it's like three to one duty.

547
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.990
We think there's some wrong with this shirt.
I like it.

548
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:30.760
Now you're going like this,
right?
Where were we?
We were,

549
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.880
we were in Upper Darby and you go Versie take that sweater off.

550
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.340
You said put in a dumpster,
put it in the ocean.
Oh,

551
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.180
do you had a bad period?
You're dressing way better.

552
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:44.560
You had a really bad period like the first six years.
Yeah.
Dude.

553
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.260
You had to grow into the fact that you were actually in show business.

554
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.710
I actually feel like you dress like a dad before you were a dead.

555
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.060
That's some of sorts of family man.

556
00:31:52.061 --> 00:31:55.300
You are like at the first time I saw it was like this dude's got to have like

557
00:31:55.301 --> 00:31:59.530
four kids.
There's no way with what he's wearing.
No,
I actually,
you know what,

558
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:00.730
it took me this in all seriousness,

559
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:05.320
it took me to my thirties to learn how to learn how to honestly drink like a

560
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:09.790
human excluding the other night,
drink a shit,
show you having good liquor,

561
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.290
dressing nice like an adult.
It takes awhile and I gotta tell you Paul,

562
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.010
not for nothing.
You got it.
You said you got a long way to go.
I got work to do.

563
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.020
You've got a long way to go.
Yeah.

564
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:24.030
But I mean I'm doing better and I look on Twitter like a Hoodie.

565
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.450
I've always given him shit because we did Carnegie Hall together and he showed

566
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:33.260
up wearing a j crew pullover in Air Jordans.
Oh.
It's just like,
oh my God,

567
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.180
a really nice sweat.
If you say one more time,
it's cashmere.
100%.

568
00:32:37.181 --> 00:32:39.210
You know how much I sweat it costs.
How much Paul?

569
00:32:39.211 --> 00:32:42.330
It was a couple hundred dollars sweater.
All black cashmere.
It didn't,

570
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:46.860
which was really nice.
Jeans.
It didn't look at that.
Fresh Jordan's on is awful.

571
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.620
Even even that animal derosa dressed up that night.
You haven't,

572
00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.570
it looked weird.
We mean look,

573
00:32:54.571 --> 00:32:57.930
we're shoes and went to Jack Cause cause his skeletal frame never quite

574
00:32:57.931 --> 00:33:01.570
developed.
Joe Doesn't have collar bones.

575
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.220
A lot of people think he shoulders.

576
00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.210
A lot of people think he doesn't have shoulders.

577
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.870
Do you remember what you told me?
Agreement.
Caroline's.

578
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.060
You whispered to me and then you told the crowd.

579
00:33:09.061 --> 00:33:10.680
I just told [inaudible] and he believed it.

580
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.110
We were in a greener mccaroline and you go,
dude,
dude,

581
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.490
you know the roles it doesn't have collarbones right and you go,

582
00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.460
that's why you said that.
And like,
and like you said,
it's so serious.

583
00:33:20.461 --> 00:33:22.620
Like you leaned in and then you go,

584
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.530
no dick who doesn't have collarbones and then you went on the stage of your

585
00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:26.560
trash.
Me,
they go,

586
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.770
I just told Versie Derosa was born without collarbones and he believed me and I

587
00:33:29.771 --> 00:33:30.810
just started laughing.
Well,

588
00:33:30.811 --> 00:33:33.840
because everybody always says Joe doesn't have shoulders.
And what it really is,

589
00:33:33.841 --> 00:33:36.390
he is,
he has shoulders.
He's missing the meat.

590
00:33:36.391 --> 00:33:41.160
That's between the neck and the shoulders.
It goes neck,

591
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:44.040
right.
The shows you were a Carnegie.
Did you wear a suit now?

592
00:33:44.041 --> 00:33:47.490
You didn't wear a suit,
did you?
What did I wear?
He didn't wear a suit.
No,

593
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.720
I didn't.
Where he,

594
00:33:48.721 --> 00:33:52.260
you said the Rosen was muttering and a sport coat and me and you were staring at

595
00:33:52.261 --> 00:33:55.650
the ground.
We were all through Dallas.
Doesn't tents.
All right.
Like that was,

596
00:33:55.651 --> 00:33:57.990
that was one of the fun,
the funny,
funniest,

597
00:33:57.991 --> 00:34:00.450
like nervousness backs that we were all excited.

598
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.460
We all knew we were going to do well,

599
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.310
but there was just like midnight then I say some broke the ice.

600
00:34:05.311 --> 00:34:09.210
Yeah we were all you set.
You sent me into Rosa up to your thing,
into your,

601
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:12.430
to your green room and know Maestro's suite and it was,

602
00:34:12.431 --> 00:34:13.530
it made us even more nervous.

603
00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:16.050
We're looking at all these dead composers on the wall and we're about ready to

604
00:34:16.051 --> 00:34:18.040
go out there and do our shit jokes.
Yeah.
And and,

605
00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:21.390
and there was this awkward silence for about like 19 seconds.

606
00:34:21.391 --> 00:34:24.150
We were all just staring at the manual.
We're like staring at the floor,

607
00:34:24.151 --> 00:34:27.420
kind of what everybody just had this big game moment.
Like we were like,
dude,

608
00:34:27.421 --> 00:34:29.940
this is what we're going to the Superbowl right now or in the locker room.

609
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.360
And you kind of just like look down and you knew what was going on.

610
00:34:33.361 --> 00:34:35.460
So you addressed it and you just go,

611
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.820
not one to fuck up or don't fuck this one up.

612
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.400
That would not be good night.
Now we kind of just were like,
we're breathing.

613
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:48.090
We were loud.
You said me and [inaudible] or staring at the ground.

614
00:34:48.091 --> 00:34:52.100
And Derosa was muttering in a sport coat them better though.

615
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.720
That's what you have to do.
Something like that.

616
00:34:53.721 --> 00:34:56.410
When I was telling the story in the podcast,
the last thing I'll do here,

617
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.670
so cause we're already up to a half hour when now the first time,
um,

618
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.760
when I do that French valley flight where I was going to fly the helicopter like

619
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:07.240
three hours by myself doing you fucking sitting there.
Yeah.
Just yeah,

620
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:12.260
like what's the sickest thing I've ever had to like mentally our one by

621
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:16.490
yourself?
Were you Lao or one minute one?
No,
no.
When you were,

622
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:18.740
once I left the fucking airport,
the safety,

623
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:21.170
cause I'd done the traffic pattern or whatever and I knew what to say.

624
00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:21.970
Long Beach Tower,

625
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:26.060
helicopter Blahblahblahblahblah pad number three requesting left closed traffic

626
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:27.800
and I just fly around the thing and it's fine.

627
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.710
But now that I had to go the second,
I say Long Beach Tower,
uh,

628
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.300
requests a helicopter,
whatever,

629
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.250
requesting frequency change and I was leaving their airspace.

630
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:37.830
Like you don't understand,

631
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:42.240
like you stay on the airport where you're training for so long that you actually

632
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:45.840
get to know the sat and the people's voices in there.

633
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.950
So that's like comforting voices and then you hear other people's,

634
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.610
now you fly away and you hear other people's voices,
dude.
And it's,
yeah,
dude,

635
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:55.920
it was a,
well,
you're just looking over the city at one point called,

636
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:59.250
what the fuck am I doing?
This is so crazy.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

637
00:35:59.251 --> 00:36:01.980
And then keeping it together and then like,
you know,

638
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.160
and how that could look it over at that empty seat next to you,

639
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:08.220
like really mean how high are you up there when you're up there?

640
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.770
When you did your hour?
Three hour test?
Well,
it depends on,
uh,

641
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.230
the elevation of the grand.
You'd be,
I mean,

642
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:18.530
basically you basically try to stay like a thousand feet up,
Jesus.
And then,
um,

643
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.860
when you go out to French valley,
uh,
the elevation of the ground goes higher.

644
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:25.050
So even though your altimeter is saying a thousand feet,

645
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:29.160
you're actually like 600 feet or whatever.
So you keep going up.

646
00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:31.530
And I don't even know if I was supposed to listen to something and change it,

647
00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:33.960
but I just looked down at the ground.
I know what a thousand feet looks like.

648
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:38.160
I just kind of,
I flew it the day before with an instructor and a,

649
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:41.220
so this other instructor is supposed to be following me with this other student

650
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:43.440
who was from China,
but she was flying too slow.

651
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.780
So like basically I didn't even realize that.

652
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:50.180
So basically if I started to enter the traffic pattern wrong,
um,
or,

653
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.340
or mess something up,
she could have jumped on and helped me out or whatever.

654
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.950
And um,
the other person of flew Bluetooth so slow,

655
00:36:55.951 --> 00:37:00.860
so I was way out in front of them.
And,
um,
I don't know,

656
00:37:00.861 --> 00:37:05.400
but I just remember before I went out to go do it,
one of the instructors there,

657
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:06.270
he's a fucking riot.

658
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:09.330
And he knew because he was nervous when he did it or whatever.

659
00:37:09.331 --> 00:37:14.190
So he came over and I was sitting down,
I was going over all my preflight shit,

660
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:17.430
making sure I had all the frequencies.
The 80 says I had a little drawing.

661
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:20.130
So I knew when I was looking down which highways I was passing on what,

662
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:22.950
cause you can fucking get lost up there.
Right.
It's fucking,

663
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:24.910
it's making me nervous now,
just talking about just the,

664
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:28.140
all the shit that could have potentially gone wrong.
And um,

665
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:33.090
so he just sat down next to me like sort of near me or whatever and sort of

666
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:34.650
glanced in my direction and I looked at him,

667
00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:37.860
he just made one of those spaces they just don't like it just kind of went like,

668
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:38.581
oh,
here we go.

669
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:43.140
When he kind of rubbed his hands together and we both burst out laughing and I,

670
00:37:43.141 --> 00:37:45.810
and I so fucking needed that.
Yeah.

671
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.530
Why'd you do this in the first place?
Like,
what was the,

672
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.070
is it like your joke where you will be able to get at or is it,

673
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:54.510
it's a combination of that.

674
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.320
And I grew up watching magnum Pi and when I used to see that do flying around

675
00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:02.250
the helicopter seemed cool as hell.
And uh,
I started in,

676
00:38:02.251 --> 00:38:05.250
I always wanted to do it,
but I always really thought I was too stupid.

677
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:07.800
I didn't think I could,
I could get through ground school or anything like that.

678
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:09.460
But then,
um,

679
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.650
I think once it became a bit on stage and I was saying,
I want it,

680
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.140
like just say it out loud,
I want to do this.
And I was thinking like,
yeah,

681
00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:19.570
I do want to do this and I finally have the time in my life and you know,

682
00:38:19.571 --> 00:38:22.470
when it's not cheap,
I finally got a little bit of money here.
I can do it.

683
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.260
Why not fly a jet when I fly an airplane?
I said,
you don't want to do that.

684
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:30.270
That's,
that's kind of gangster.
It'd be the gable to get in a jet though.
Um,
yeah,

685
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:35.100
no,
that's a,
yeah,
I dunno.
I just,

686
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.710
I just think helicopters a cooler because you really can fly.
Like he can just,

687
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.990
you can go forwards,
backwards.
You that Hummingbird,
you can just stop backwards.

688
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:48.130
Yeah.
It's just you just tilting the disk,
Huh?
The main road and it's just like,

689
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.880
it's like a little fan,
Paul.
That's all it is.
That's Ballsy,
dude.

690
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:54.490
I give you credit,
man.
Seriously.
I'll give you a credit to be able to do that.

691
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:57.130
Then I got to tell you it's it's way.
It's way,
dude.

692
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:59.980
I'm saying might not that fucking drive coming out to your placement

693
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.590
with fog in deer and all of that shit.

694
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.740
No street lights going through this headless horseman.
Shit.
You got up here,
man.

695
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:09.574
I'm telling you,

696
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.330
this is the most dangerous thing you'll ever do is drive down a highway when

697
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:15.880
it's congested and,
but it's not like traffic.

698
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.750
Everybody's still doing like 70 and you know,
people listen to the radio,

699
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:21.970
they get a texting,
they're doing all of this type of stuff.

700
00:39:21.971 --> 00:39:25.770
People have this whole thing like,
oh,
I can't,
you know,
you're up there.

701
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.540
If something goes wrong,
you just plummet to your death.
It's like,

702
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:32.020
think about how many times you've driven down the highway are driven down a road

703
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.160
and you see that little memorial a little make shift,
the reef and the candles.

704
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.320
People fucking die all the time driving it,
dude,

705
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.390
I'm not flying up there.
And there's like,
Dude,
you understand?

706
00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:45.790
You drive down a road like up here,
a little two lane road,

707
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.090
you're doing 40 another guy's doing 40 on the other side of the road.

708
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:51.640
All it takes them is the accidentally come over to your side.

709
00:39:51.641 --> 00:39:54.070
He got a head on collision.
Not to mention on either side,

710
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:56.760
you've got trees and all this crap,
dude.
You go up to it.

711
00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.990
There's nothing up to this other people.

712
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.460
But you taught and you're talking to each other.
Yeah.
So I just think it's,

713
00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:07.720
it's still,
it's still dangerous,
but compared to what you're doing down here,

714
00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:10.000
cool.
Walk away from a car accident.
That's what,

715
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:14.560
why the Harrison Ford walked away.
Yeah.
Say all right.
Yeah.

716
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:18.280
I mean that's nothing.
Why I don't like planes.
When you still land,

717
00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:19.990
he's still going to be going like 60 knots.

718
00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.740
She joined the land on which you got to do a helicopter.
You just,

719
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:27.100
you just come straight down and I'll let me after you do your flair.
Yeah.

720
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.380
And you just go straight down.
Yeah.
And it's no,

721
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.500
and hopefully a tail doesn't strike anything.
Well,

722
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:34.480
what sucks is you probably,

723
00:40:34.481 --> 00:40:36.430
cause I told you what the most gangster thing would be,

724
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.710
the one of the most incredible things you could do would be this.

725
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.610
Bill's going to Vegas.
You headlines some shows in Vegas,
right?

726
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.300
You take your fucking helicopter landed on top of the Mirage.
Oh,

727
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:49.180
y'all don't think I haven't even thought about that already gets you get your

728
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:51.220
money and then you get your fucking helicopter.
You Go.

729
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.420
The only thing is I heard in,
in the,
the winds with the desert is no,

730
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.250
I wouldn't want to fly.
You can't know all the planes come in crazy.

731
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.010
The planes at the airport coming crazy because of the desert,

732
00:41:00.011 --> 00:41:03.760
cause it'll wind and all that stuff.
So I couldn't imagine it.
Helicopter.

733
00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:06.160
You're sitting up there.
Yeah,
yeah.

734
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.790
The sand really holds the heat and then that heats it up and then cooler air

735
00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:12.880
comes in and then it shoots up.
I have to know all that other shit.
Yeah.

736
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.860
So what you have is this,
this you have to be lifting force Paul.
Yeah.

737
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.180
Which causes turbulence.
It's never an easy landing out there,
but um,

738
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:22.950
every once in a while it is,
but I,

739
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.700
I wouldn't want to land on top of a building anyways.

740
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:27.340
I don't think I have that skill and I just think it's good to be unbelievably

741
00:41:27.341 --> 00:41:31.510
fucking windy.
And then also I would be worried like,
okay,

742
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.900
now I am,
I'm coming down and it's just like,

743
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:37.190
if I fuck this up,

744
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.940
if I fucked this up a little bit and go over this side of the building trying to

745
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:44.180
correct that,
I'm just going to,
that's been any special though.

746
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.010
If the opening to your special was you getting out of your funk and then going

747
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:50.700
down?
It would be,

748
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:57.010
it would be obnoxious.
How are you doing?
First of all,

749
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.990
I barely even know what the fuck I'm doing.
Jeff Dunham.

750
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.320
Jeff Dunham is like maverick from top gun.

751
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.660
Jeff Dunham builds his own helicopters.
Did you ever see that?

752
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.930
There's this whole thing on Jeff Dunham is fucking unbelievable.

753
00:42:08.931 --> 00:42:10.100
It's like a fucking renaissance man.

754
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.350
Do you know that that whole thing with the puppets,

755
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:16.190
like this is a deal if you go out and you buy the puppet in a store and then you

756
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:20.060
become famous with it,
like the makers of the puppet can come at you and say,

757
00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:23.360
well you did it with our product.
So he made his own,
right.
Yeah.

758
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.220
But he does make his own.
Like I would make an a frigging it kit.
It's okay.

759
00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:32.210
It's all right.
Let's turn a little face on my hand.
Dude.
This guy,

760
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:36.620
like he's got like these computers,
they do like this three d three dimensional,

761
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:40.850
like design of the head and then he puts it in like this looks like a microwave

762
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.330
and he makes,
I can't even explain what it was like watching like,
uh,

763
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:49.370
the guy's a genius.
Yeah.
I,
you know,
I really wish I knew what that,

764
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.820
that documentary on him was and it was all his life and it really fleshed them

765
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:57.440
out and made him a person because that guy gets a lot of shit.

766
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:01.290
Oh he does puppets and bins filled because it's like,
yeah,
he fucking,

767
00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:05.270
he the guy made it as a front 12 course in the two thousands you know,
difficult.

768
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:09.120
That is,
it's like me making it as like a blacksmith,
you know what I mean?
Just

769
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:15.230
like the level of talent you've got to have.
I was absolutely blown away.

770
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.780
Our man,
he's a smart man.
Understatement.
Yeah.
Understatement and yeah.

771
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.840
I mean I'm not eventual liquids guy,
but like what he did with them with the end,

772
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.970
the terrorist guy I was blue was pretty clever.

773
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.700
I'm just saying that's not my style but got awesome.

774
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.280
The guy builds his own frigging helicopters,
does he?
Yeah.

775
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.230
You have to go and talk about balls the size of your house.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

776
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.800
Paul.
I wouldn't get,
I wouldn't get on a skateboard that I made.

777
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.100
I went on on a flat sidewalk and I'd be wearing elbow pads and knee pads.

778
00:43:48.351 --> 00:43:50.420
This guy gets in his and I mean,
it's insane.

779
00:43:50.421 --> 00:43:53.150
So crazy if you really want to learn about,
and he would be the guy.
All right,

780
00:43:53.151 --> 00:43:55.340
so we've already done 40 something minutes.
You know why Paul?

781
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:59.690
Because it's so effortless to talk to you.
All right.

797
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:52.620
podcast.
Bill Burr and uh,
Paul [inaudible].

798
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:57.120
We were up in Canada discussing time travel.
Enjoy

799
00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:12.843
<v 2>what's going the</v>

800
00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.813
time travel.

801
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.350
<v 0>Um,
what time traveling Billy thrills.</v>

802
00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.000
Um,

803
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.530
if you could travel to any time period period prior to 1900,

804
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.550
but you were forced to live out your life there and you couldn't come back to

805
00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:36.980
the present,
where would you choose to go?

806
00:45:36.981 --> 00:45:41.660
Keep in mind anything before 1900 means everyone probably smells,

807
00:45:41.661 --> 00:45:45.350
it dies at 40 years of age.
That's not true.
Not if you have money.

808
00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.071
You'll live long.

809
00:45:46.071 --> 00:45:50.000
Ben Franklin look for a long time and he was a fucking booze bag out there

810
00:45:50.001 --> 00:45:53.900
flying his kite in the rain.
Did he live long?
Yeah.
Yeah,

811
00:45:53.901 --> 00:45:56.570
he lived to like be like 70.
Oh,
wow.
Yeah.

812
00:45:56.571 --> 00:46:00.320
And he went out there with his kite in the rain and it was fucking shit faced.

813
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:03.910
So he had his house keys tied to the thing.
That's the real story.

814
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.620
How we discovered electricity was fucking hammered you serious?
Yeah.

815
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.000
He was out of his fucking mind.
And if he was actually stone sober,

816
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.660
he probably would have died because he would attend stuff when he got

817
00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:17.810
electrocuted.
But cause he was drunk,
he was all relaxed.
Like,
hey man,

818
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.980
he just rolled down the hill,
landed on his ball.
That's actually how I went bald.

819
00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.370
He went down the hill,
like one of the lightning struck,

820
00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.970
they hit the key in and blew his head off.

821
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:32.380
What new studies have shown all of this?
Oh,

822
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:37.390
I thought it was just fucking male pattern baldness.
No,
he got elected.
No,

823
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.960
like 30% of people,
this is the worst thing they never talk about.

824
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:44.440
If you get struck by lightning like you immediately,

825
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:48.590
it blows off that top part.
You serious?
Yeah.

826
00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.870
And it doesn't come back either.
It wouldn't make a difference with me,

827
00:46:53.871 --> 00:46:56.930
but that's why Mike Michael Bolton does that.
Yeah.

828
00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.770
He does that charity thing for a don't tell him he does a charity for people

829
00:47:00.771 --> 00:47:02.730
that get struck by lightning got blown.

830
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:09.590
I can't believe you believe in this shit.
I'm just making all this up.
Yeah,

831
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.680
the fucking top of the head.
You know it doesn't,
but does he have a charity,

832
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.920
Michael Boat?
Yeah.
Yeah,
but not for that.
No.

833
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.520
Fuck ain't committed to that.
I did.
All right,
let's continue.

834
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:27.800
This fucking
dude that was getting so deep,

835
00:47:27.801 --> 00:47:29.350
I couldn't keep a straight face.
I'm like,

836
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:31.390
there's no way he's believing in this one.
All right,
this one,

837
00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:34.930
get it down the hill.
I said,
that's how he went bald and they go,
no,
no.
Wait,

838
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:37.780
here's a better life.
You still like really?
Is that what happened?

839
00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:43.300
That Jesus Christ Paul,
what's the world coming to?
All right Paul,

840
00:47:43.301 --> 00:47:47.620
if you could live any time period before 1900 anywhere.
Anytime.

841
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.510
Oh Man.
Where would you go?
I don't know.

842
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.000
I would go somewhere where there was a war,
but wait,
but in the question,

843
00:47:57.001 --> 00:47:58.440
can I take things from present

844
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.850
so you could time travel to any period?
1900

845
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:04.380
<v 3>okay.</v>

846
00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.230
<v 0>Do,
what the fuck would you bring here?
The second you pulled anything out,</v>

847
00:48:07.231 --> 00:48:08.940
they think you were a witch and they kill you.

848
00:48:08.941 --> 00:48:12.270
What I'm saying is I would go to there with like shit that they don't have now.

849
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.360
That's what I'm saying.
Like in a war zone,
I fucking just lace.

850
00:48:15.361 --> 00:48:17.220
Like if I took a side,
you know,

851
00:48:17.221 --> 00:48:20.310
you go with a couple uzis or a fucking machine gun.
He just fucking leg.

852
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.300
Whether you be a fucking God forever,
it'd be a hero.
You know?
You'd be like,

853
00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:25.460
you'd be good God,
what are you gonna do?

854
00:48:25.461 --> 00:48:28.790
You're just gonna walk out in the field and use Nike fucking sweatshirt.

855
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:33.180
It Jordan's.
Yeah,
just walk out,
dress like this.
And they would be like,

856
00:48:33.181 --> 00:48:35.970
you know when they were packing muskets and doing the whole thing and I'd be

857
00:48:35.971 --> 00:48:39.530
like,
no,
no,
no guys,
I got this.
What year?
What year?
Just so I just fucking,

858
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.660
and they would be like,
oh my God,
but just be the fucking man forever.

859
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.900
I'd be the man forever.
You imagine that?
Yeah.

860
00:48:45.901 --> 00:48:49.770
I'm trying to wrap my head around where they're not completely freaked out by

861
00:48:49.771 --> 00:48:54.630
you.
You're going to go first of all,
first of all,

862
00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:58.760
what year are you going back to?
Well,
he said why?
He said prior 1900.
Yeah.

863
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:01.740
So what year are you going back to?
Uh,
the pack and Musket.

864
00:49:01.741 --> 00:49:05.840
So what are we talking here?
Uh,
well there was a couple of wonder,
oh,

865
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:10.440
what is it like 18 like 18,
17,
1870s right.

866
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:15.420
Well by 1870s they had like the Winchesters and those repeating rifles and that

867
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.270
they actually had their first like machine gun,
the civil war,

868
00:49:18.271 --> 00:49:21.120
I believe Spanish American.
Anyways,
we had the little frank,

869
00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.940
if you fucking mowed them down,
I go before that time then.

870
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.500
So you're talking like I,
if I was you I would go early 18 hundreds.
Okay.

871
00:49:28.501 --> 00:49:32.100
So I'd go early 18 hundreds.
Yup.
And I would bring some sort of,

872
00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:34.650
who are you going to mow down?
Um,

873
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:38.790
what if you went in the French and Indian war and you actually found on the side

874
00:49:38.791 --> 00:49:43.170
of the Indians what year was just mow down a bunch of French people,

875
00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:45.120
whichever side I decided to choose,

876
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.140
like when I got there and they saw that I showed up from a time machine,
right?

877
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.380
One group's going to be nicer to me right now,

878
00:49:52.381 --> 00:49:54.390
they're all going to be completely freaked out by it.
Right?

879
00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.390
There's going to be the one who was a threat and you'll probably have to turn

880
00:49:57.391 --> 00:50:00.960
your Uzi on them.
Then you'd have to steal their clothes

881
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.040
and then try to fucking do an accent.

882
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.470
I would choose a side of the people that were the nicest,

883
00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:10.530
warmest to me when I got there,
and then I would fucking become their savior.

884
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.110
Nobody's going to be nice to Paul.
You understand that?
If I did it,

885
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:16.740
they would rewrite the book on me.
They would read,
they would be a mythical I,

886
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:20.160
they would kill you,
kill you.
They would kill you.

887
00:50:20.161 --> 00:50:22.290
They would tell stories happened to Jesus.
No,

888
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:26.820
they would tell what happened at Jesus.
They got crucified.
Uzi.
Okay.

889
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:31.190
So yeah,
but you're going to run out of bullets.
So,
no,
but I'm in the question.

890
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:34.040
It doesn't specify like what I'm coming with.
I'm going to go prepare.

891
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.680
How big is his fucking time machine?
No,
no,
no,
no.

892
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:40.580
I'm going to go with like a bunch of clips and a couple of Uzis.
Okay.

893
00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:45.470
And they're gonna write fucking stories about me ordering cycle from the fucking

894
00:50:45.471 --> 00:50:48.630
future.
Some mythical lazy,
close,

895
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.160
Lazy,
close,

896
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.000
some Italian do front of you or they're not even know what New York is.

897
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.600
I actually,
maybe the other thing they want to know.
Yeah,
there you,

898
00:50:58.601 --> 00:51:02.630
you're not listening.
You Paul.
This is the key.

899
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.720
They wouldn't all kill me,
but Paul is,
Hey,
I'm here to help.
So listen,
I got,

900
00:51:05.721 --> 00:51:07.880
I came to this,
I can't listen to what I would tell him.
Okay.

901
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:09.590
And then you tell him what you'd say.
I say,
look,

902
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.770
I came from the future to help you.
This machine brought me here to help you.

903
00:51:12.771 --> 00:51:15.480
I'm going to solve your problems.
And then I would fuck a pull out.

904
00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.750
And let me ask you this cloth to this.
Let's say,
okay,
fucking after this tour,

905
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:25.850
you can't sleep one night and you look out your back yard and you see this

906
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:27.620
fucking thing appear out of nowhere.

907
00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.420
And this guy gets out and starts walking towards your fucking house from a time

908
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:33.254
machine

909
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.660
and let's just say you have a shotgun and this guy walks up.
He goes,
no,
no.
Hey,

910
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:39.381
listen,
listen,

911
00:51:39.381 --> 00:51:44.381
Paul Paul and he's wearing these weird workout clothes from 300 years in the

912
00:51:44.571 --> 00:51:46.730
future.
Listen,
I'm here to help you.

913
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.910
I'm here to do things that you're gonna like you're going to fucking trust this

914
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:53.450
guy because I was sleeping in my bed and,
and I'm not.
I'm talking about,

915
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:55.130
I want to show up into a conflict.

916
00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:00.080
I want to show up to the moment of a conflict and fucking take a side and when

917
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:02.750
it,
I want to win the game for the team.
This is what I'm saying.

918
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.810
It's a very narcissistic behavior here.
You know,

919
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.880
you think he's just going to show up on a battlefield,

920
00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.810
they're going to be like our brain show up and you fucking walk out of this

921
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:16.530
thing with a hoodie sweatshirt.
And a fucking Uzi.
Yeah.
And the,

922
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:17.040
the,

923
00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.550
the union army and the rebels are not like one of them is one of them's going to

924
00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:24.980
embrace you.
Yeah.
One of those groups,
they're losing fathers and sons.
And I go,

925
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:29.930
I got this fucked a musket and I just fucking,
I just fucking lays out an army.

926
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:32.330
They're going to look at me like,
dude,
this guy were they gonna do,

927
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.320
they're gonna go that we've been saved this.
He was say what?

928
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:40.310
Once they realize you are mortal,
they would fucking,
probably,

929
00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:43.040
they would,
they would take your weapons is what they would do.

930
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:44.900
How'd it get in the UC from me?

931
00:52:44.901 --> 00:52:48.080
If they're fucking pack in a musket and they have knives because what he's

932
00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:50.690
talking and Paul can cause you're gonna have your fucking back to him.

933
00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:55.310
If he's shooting at the other guy,
Paul,
you know what they're gonna do.

934
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:58.140
They're gonna Probably Act nice to you.
And then,
and then,

935
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.760
and then what they're going to do is they're going to try to figure out where

936
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:03.140
the fuck you came from.

937
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:07.620
They're going immediately confiscate your fucking time machine and they're going

938
00:53:07.621 --> 00:53:12.621
to try to see if they can do weight so they can run the fucking world to how

939
00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:16.040
they're going to confiscate the time machine from me when I'm the one with the

940
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:19.650
Ammo,
I'm the one with the semiautomatic weapons.
I'm the one who's just say,

941
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.010
what are they going to do here?
What are they going to do?

942
00:53:22.011 --> 00:53:27.011
Paul is they're going to fucking put an all points out on every fucking Goddamn

943
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.940
tree out there wanted sweatpant guy from the future.

944
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.120
This man alone has been in this time zone,

945
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:40.680
this error for fucking 20 minutes and he's already killed

946
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.600
600 feet.
No.
Here's the thing.

947
00:53:45.601 --> 00:53:48.030
The question was where would you go and if you couldn't come back,

948
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.680
if I survived this all did you,
did you,
did you see ledger did forget about,

949
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:57.650
I know you didn't read anything in history.
Yeah.
Okay.

950
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:00.830
Yeah.
World War that does muskets in 1870.

951
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.030
I mean in 1870,
like I just laughed so hard to see in thoughts.
No.

952
00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:10.290
Um,
world war two I read about,
I read about shit.

953
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:16.270
You literally sound like you sitting on a stoop right now.
I know stuff.
God,

954
00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.113
what was the question?

955
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.990
I was going to ask if I was going to talk about people in history,

956
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.940
but how about like,
just we'll go with movies.
All right.

957
00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:28.680
You saw there will be blood.
Yes.
Okay.

958
00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:33.480
That's based off like the robber barons,
uh,
of,

959
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:36.690
of the fucking,
you know,
17,
1800 hundreds.
The,
uh,

960
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:40.980
the people you got involved in the oil rig,
the railroad guys,
the Rockefellers,

961
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:45.290
the Vanderbilts,
the fucking people who like fucking start it at all.
Yeah.
Yeah.

962
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:50.010
They came over here,
right?
They fucking got it.
You know,
they just,

963
00:54:50.011 --> 00:54:54.150
it was wide open.
You can do whatever the fuck you want and they,
they did it.

964
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:57.930
All right.
All right.
It's funny,
I've made fun of you for being stupid.

965
00:54:57.931 --> 00:54:59.670
I can't even explain this.
These guys,

966
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:03.270
the JP Morgans and all these types of fuck guys,

967
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:08.271
when you show up with this machine where they can fucking change the past,

968
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:12.270
they can change the fucking future.

969
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.350
These sociopaths psychos are not going to let you,

970
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.600
Paul Versey.
Once they fucking sit down and they talk to you,
Paul,

971
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:25.320
take day.
See where the fuck you're at.

972
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:30.210
They will pretend to be friends with you.
And when the second you shut down your,

973
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:34.710
your Uzi to have a little bit of mutton with them at the villa,

974
00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.680
they would cut you ear to ear.
First of all,

975
00:55:37.681 --> 00:55:41.310
I'm too fucking street smart to ever put my Aussie down and let them fund start

976
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:43.970
fucking drinking tea and eating crumpets with this phone.

977
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.290
Like how you think you're street smart and every fucking error.

978
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.310
Like you know what the signs are in 18 12th you think I'm gonna leave my fucking

979
00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:53.730
Uzi down when nobody's got one that's gold to those people.
That's,
that's,
that's,

980
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.740
that's ends up to his problems.
I would never do that.

981
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.410
You're going to become friends with these people always having a gun trained on

982
00:55:58.411 --> 00:56:01.530
them.
So you're telling me how about this,
this is what I could also do.

983
00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:05.220
I could get there in my time machine and I could befriend one person and I could

984
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:08.280
let them know that I'm here to help them if they need and tell him when I could

985
00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:11.340
do.
And then maybe they can say,
hey listen,
when we get into,
you know,

986
00:56:11.341 --> 00:56:15.810
when the rebels come,
I've got a guy,
you know what,
I wasn't even listening.

987
00:56:15.811 --> 00:56:18.900
I was thinking about what I was going to do.
All right,
well what would you do?

988
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:23.070
I would go back to once in 1900.
I would go back anyway,

989
00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:27.560
keep in mind anything before eight prior to 1900,

990
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:30.690
I would go back to 1899.
Okay.

991
00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:35.310
Cause I want the most up to date and medical fucking shit available for when I

992
00:56:35.311 --> 00:56:40.230
come down with polio.
Whatever bullshit that's going to hit me.
Um,

993
00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:40.801
I would,

994
00:56:40.801 --> 00:56:45.801
I would do is I would try out and make a major league baseball team and I would

995
00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:50.400
fucking destroy them with my,
uh,
with my knowledge of nutrition,

996
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:54.870
my hundred year,
120 years in the future of my knowledge of nutrition.

997
00:56:54.871 --> 00:56:55.441
You know what I would do,

998
00:56:55.441 --> 00:56:59.460
I would take some tea ds back with me before they even know how to test for it

999
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:02.010
and I would fucking roid up.

1000
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:07.200
Fucking just give Bruce and I would try out for the Boston Red Sox and we would

1001
00:57:07.651 --> 00:57:12.000
win it for every fucking year of right through the twenties that's a great idea.

1002
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:14.790
That's what I would do.
But you'd have to go back with steroids.
Yeah.

1003
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:15.541
You'd have to go back.

1004
00:57:15.541 --> 00:57:17.340
You'd have to convince these people that you're going to inject.

1005
00:57:17.341 --> 00:57:19.910
Still don't think I could hit a curve ball.
Huh?

1006
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.080
I still don't think I could hit a fucking curve ball,

1007
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:25.170
but I just figured if I went back to the fucking look,
I couldn't make them.

1008
00:57:25.171 --> 00:57:28.740
I couldn't make a major league baseball team in the 19 hundreds but I think I

1009
00:57:28.741 --> 00:57:33.060
could make one in the 1890 so just I would have me go back.
When did it start?

1010
00:57:33.061 --> 00:57:36.090
1880 join the fucking Phillies.

1011
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.130
I wouldn't want them to win a championship.

1012
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.820
Whenever the one of the fucking red sox come around,

1013
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:43.680
they was the first city the red sox came around.

1014
00:57:43.681 --> 00:57:45.940
And what not and the 18 early 19 hundreds

1015
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.020
<v 4>okay.</v>

1016
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.190
<v 0>I'd like to play whenever they,</v>

1017
00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.330
they built Fenway in 1912 I would just like to come up to bat.
God Damn.

1018
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.930
And I couldn't do it,
so I'd have to go back.
But I'm my age now.

1019
00:57:56.931 --> 00:57:58.310
I'd be too fucking old by then.

1020
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.510
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1021
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:03.270
<v 0>Fuck him.
He can still kill it though.
All right.
This is what I would do.</v>

1022
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:07.530
I become totally fluid in Latin and a,

1023
00:58:07.531 --> 00:58:10.860
I would fucking go back and I'd watch a game at the Roman Colosseum.

1024
00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.990
That's fine.
I'm trying to sports related.
I would just take my chances with,

1025
00:58:15.991 --> 00:58:19.260
I would just go with the heavy artillery.
I would be,
I would be a defense.

1026
00:58:19.261 --> 00:58:22.740
I would be,
you know,
I'm going the Ronald Reagan route,
just spend it,
all of them,

1027
00:58:22.741 --> 00:58:23.660
all the money on defect.

1028
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:28.670
I would hope that they would utilize me that way as an asset military wise.

1029
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:32.610
You know,
dude,
you're out of your mind dude.
Why?

1030
00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:37.650
Like just me going back thinking that I could fucking make a team because I

1031
00:58:37.651 --> 00:58:40.700
looked at buying those 1890s like did.
They will like softball teams,

1032
00:58:40.701 --> 00:58:43.710
so just had ringers there.
That's,
you know,
all those guys didn't stretch do,

1033
00:58:43.711 --> 00:58:46.440
but you know,
you just want to ask you how can a wild west days,

1034
00:58:46.441 --> 00:58:49.710
they fucking went outside and they went back to back and then 10 faces.

1035
00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.290
I fucking get rid of that man.
I'm talking about,

1036
00:58:52.291 --> 00:58:55.410
I have everything I'm going to ask.
You don't have anything,
Paul,

1037
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:59.710
what do you have is a gun and bullets.
You have the best gun,
right?

1038
00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.110
With the best bullets,

1039
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:06.030
but you're ignoring the fact that an entire army is going to go after you,

1040
00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:10.050
that they're not going to allow it up the hill and went break them.

1041
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:12.090
They're not going to allow you.

1042
00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.680
They wouldn't allow you to take pop,
by the way,

1043
00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.870
for the way that you've seized power.

1044
00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:24.130
As you assimilate and you worked your way up through the ranks and then you have

1045
00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:28.460
a new strike when the time is right.
That's how you do it.

1046
00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:33.470
If you try and start your own shoe,
come in,
they're all rogue.
And I was like,

1047
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:37.190
listen,
I have better shit then you guys could ever dream of having,

1048
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:41.360
but don't worry,
I'm your friend.
These fucking paranoid assholes,

1049
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:43.970
these control freaks as they want,
that you could not live.

1050
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.380
They would be smearing you in,
in the,
the,

1051
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:52.430
the paper with every fucking day.
There's talking about this reminds me of that.

1052
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:56.810
You were a big of a threat than the savages that need to be clear.
They would,

1053
00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.600
they would put you above getting rid of native Americans at that point.

1054
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.790
You would have to be eliminated,

1055
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:07.030
but not before they found out how took apart the gun to figure out how it works.

1056
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.580
Tortured you for all the fucking,
um,

1057
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.600
knowledge that you had and grilled you about that time machine to figure out if

1058
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.630
you built it or he just fucking used it.
So what if I lied to him and I said,

1059
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:20.360
I could get more of this.
I got a time machine.
Nobody knows where it is,

1060
01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:23.330
but I could go back and get more of this like so if they knew that I could,

1061
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:25.760
I could,
you know what I mean?
If I lied to him that that's the best.

1062
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:30.070
That's the best move you've sent out to all of this scenario where maybe you

1063
01:00:30.071 --> 01:00:34.670
know you could do a play on their greed and their desire to have more.

1064
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:37.430
That's actually a smart fucking move.

1065
01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:40.250
But if you just think that you're just going to show up with your fucking cigar

1066
01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:45.140
and your Uzi and come walking out on a battlefield through this gets,

1067
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:49.820
I'll just do this and just change the course of history depending on who was

1068
01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:54.080
nicer to you.
What if the Germans were nice view and world war two I mean,

1069
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:56.660
you know they had nice uniforms.
Paul,
you're going to sign with them.

1070
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:57.860
How funny would it be?

1071
01:00:57.861 --> 01:01:02.510
Just watching me going there with air maxes on Nike Air Max is on a cigar and

1072
01:01:02.511 --> 01:01:04.820
it's the white chair and I'm like,
listen,
sit down.

1073
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:09.430
I got a gun that could solve it and I just show the guy I would love to.

1074
01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.400
I would fucking love to see the looks on their faces and then all of a sudden

1075
01:01:13.401 --> 01:01:16.600
they rebel against me.
I think if,
I think if you actually,

1076
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:20.000
if you actually went out there and you mowed down the whole other side with what

1077
01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:21.980
you had.
Yeah,
that was my original.

1078
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:27.010
That's what I would think that if I was on the on of the,

1079
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.470
on your side,

1080
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:33.260
I would slowly be backing away as you were doing it and then I would slip into

1081
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:36.650
the woods and fucking runaway is what I would do.

1082
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.860
I would get the fuck away from you because I don't pull,

1083
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:44.540
you understand what the fuck I'm seeing.
Okay.

1084
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:49.550
You can show up in your space close with you fucking ray gun.

1085
01:01:49.551 --> 01:01:53.270
I mean it's just like I'm out of their fucking out of there.

1086
01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.440
I'm going to leave and if you come towards me,
I'm going to shoot.

1087
01:01:57.441 --> 01:02:01.040
I mean if a fucking alien landed and I had a gun,
fuck his ray gun,

1088
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:05.240
we fuck all that bullshit.
If it starts coming towards me,
I got to shoot at it.

1089
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:05.991
If that happened,

1090
01:02:05.991 --> 01:02:09.640
I'd be living in the biggest house in the 18th I have all the women would be
fun.

1091
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:12.970
I would be the fucking Jesus there.
They would fucking draw pictures of,

1092
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:13.880
do you know what it is,
Paul?

1093
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:18.410
This is your own little narcissistic head trip and that's the exact thing that

1094
01:02:18.411 --> 01:02:19.950
would bring you down.
You know something.

1095
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.900
I think that this was a great answer to your listener's question while you're

1096
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.570
acting.
You are,
I love about all of this,
Paul.

1097
01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:28.740
You're acting like you know how to make a fucking Uzi tiny machine.

1098
01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:29.551
You're going to bring one.

1099
01:02:29.551 --> 01:02:33.060
So I did was bring it and they're going to figure it out because the scientists

1100
01:02:33.061 --> 01:02:35.010
back then were just as brilliant as a scientist.

1101
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:37.470
Now they just don't have the information that the ones do today.

1102
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.650
So they would immediately break down your fucking what you are that you're asked

1103
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:44.010
to take my gun,
that you're a stand up comedian.

1104
01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:48.150
That's what they would do.
Well,
what are you going to do,
Paul?

1105
01:02:48.151 --> 01:02:51.360
What are you gonna do for food?
You got an Uzi Adair.
Okay.

1106
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:54.730
And then did you know how to start a fire without some wood?
Yeah,
rob,
to get,

1107
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.610
you know how to do that.
Yeah.
How do you do it?

1108
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.000
You know how to start a fire without matches.
Yeah.
I mean,
I've seen it done.

1109
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:03.750
I've watched it onto TV.
I've seen it on the fucking,
I've seen it on youtube.

1110
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:07.200
I did.
I fucking sit in on youtube when we ran a matches at the house one time.

1111
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:08.460
I swear to God I was watching a clip.
Yeah.

1112
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:12.750
Have watched it to the guy sat down and have you done it yet?
He gets the driest,

1113
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:15.750
whatever they call it,
the grass or the dry fucking Paul.

1114
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.330
I'm gonna tell you this right now.
They fucking,
if you can make,

1115
01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.030
if you could start a fire,
twist the thing they right.

1116
01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:24.450
If you could start a fire tonight.
All right,

1117
01:03:24.451 --> 01:03:28.740
we'll go to the Toronto Central Park.
If you could start a fight,
a fight,
a fire.

1118
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:29.880
I'll give you all the money.

1119
01:03:29.881 --> 01:03:33.120
I'm going to make it on this tour with don't watch the youtube video again.

1120
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:36.020
I want to see you start this fucking far.
Okay.

1121
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:39.690
And if you don't some wood or style,
if you don't,

1122
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:45.170
then you have to walk into the fucking into Lake Ontario with the Jordan on,

1123
01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.420
but 30 and shit.
Well,
that's the point.
I want you to suffer.

1124
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.020
You're hilarious.
You're like,
yeah,
you did see it.
Wow.
