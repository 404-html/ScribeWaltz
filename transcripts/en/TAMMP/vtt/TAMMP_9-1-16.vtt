1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.330
Hey,
what's going on?
It's built burn.
It's time for Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:04.500
Just before Friday,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.160
Monday morning podcast and checking in on you.
Uh,

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.250
just checking in on you.

5
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.310
I've got to say by voice today cause I'm going to go do some,
uh,

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.060
f is for family stuff.
Remember that show came out in December.
Uh,

7
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:19.290
we'll still working on season two,

8
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.100
so I bring it up every once in a while so you don't forget about us.
Um,

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.030
I'm going to go,
uh,
you know,
we,
you,
you're right.
I'm,

10
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.430
then you record them and then you'll look at them with the,
the,
the,

11
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
the sort of roughed out.
Animatics is it called?
And then you're like,

12
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.100
well that didn't work.
I don't think that's going to be funny.

13
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.080
And then you got to punch it up and uh,
you know,

14
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.570
it's weird stuff on the page and shit that's on the table read.

15
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.820
All of a sudden when you draw it,
you line it up with the characters.

16
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.450
Sometimes you know,
things that you thought were going to work,
don't,

17
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.180
and then other things that you didn't think much of do work.
So,

18
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.370
so we're doing all that shit.
So anyways,

19
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.580
all freckles was a recording yesterday.
And,
um,

20
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.700
took my old truck out,
the old 68 f 103 on the tree,

21
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.580
having a great fucking at times got ac and I still don't use it.

22
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.810
I haven't used it in so long.

23
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.690
I actually don't remember how to put it in to how to put it on me.
Sorry,

24
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.770
how to turn it on.
Because when they put it in,
they showed it to me and like,

25
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.020
it doesn't line up to what it says.

26
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.670
Like literally you move it over to like heat and cold air comes out or some shit

27
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:21.740
like that.
Um,
it's Kinda as part of the fun at owning the thing.
And uh,

28
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.000
I gradually figured it out,
but you know,

29
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.870
as long as you're not sitting in traffic and you're driving along,

30
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:32.250
you get the little triangle windows open,
you blow air in and it's,
it's cool.
So,

31
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.250
um,
anyways,
I went to,
uh,

32
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.600
I went to leave the record and a la is just a relentless place when it comes to

33
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.600
traffic.
It's has like this sixth sense,

34
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.601
like it knows what you're trying to do and they do everything they can to

35
00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.630
prevent you from taking any time off of your trip.

36
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.750
They put up,
they put up concrete barriers.

37
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:02.220
They have right turns only not a through street.
Yeah.
There's just,

38
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:05.700
they just like fuck you.
There's one way to go home.

39
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.910
Everybody get on it and they just funnel you down this thing and they go,

40
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:13.380
just sit in it and listen to your books on tape and till you get to your house.

41
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.160
That's basically how it works.
So every once in a while you try to make a move.

42
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.440
And I gotta be honest with you,
when I see other people making a move and they,

43
00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:24.900
and they pulled it off,
I always say,
hey,
good fan.
Nice,
smooth,
nice,
smooth.

44
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.680
So I'm sitting there,
gone,
I go out,
I want to go left.

45
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.090
I want to jump on the 10 right?
You can't go left.
You can only go right.

46
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.920
So I go right and I'm like,
[inaudible] fuck me.

47
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.770
And I'm watching all these cars passing me going the direction I want to know.

48
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.860
Go and I'm thinking in my head,
I'm going to be behind all these motherfuckers,

49
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.230
do the right thing,
Bill,
go up to the light to make a left,

50
00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:47.010
to then make another left and another left,
and then a right to fucking,

51
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.740
you know what happened to it properly.

52
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.120
And I'm sitting there waiting to make this left and all of a sudden the oncoming

53
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:56.780
traffic just trickles to a stop.
And there's just like this,

54
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.590
a little entrance way into a strip.
So I'm like,

55
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.800
why don't just bang a Uie right here.
Look around.
I don't see any cop.
Well,

56
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.310
one I had just gone by,
but he was all the way up the way,
you know?

57
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.550
So I think he's got his eyes front.
So I say fuck it.

58
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:14.230
And I Bang a little uturn and I'm riding along.
My God,
that was great.
You know,

59
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.820
running through the gears wins.
Coming in,
driving an old pickup truck,

60
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.120
a Maca,
right?
I'm having a great time and all of a sudden look behind me.
Go,
oh,

61
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.660
look at that fucking motorcycle,
man.
I'm a motorcycle guy.
Like it.
Let's,

62
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.580
let's check it out.
See what's going on with that fucking motorcycle.
Then I go,

63
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:33.460
oh,
that's a cop.
It's a cop.
And I was like,
well,
he's not doing anything.

64
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:36.150
So he didn't see me.
And then I just started thinking how funny it is,

65
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.290
or weird or whatever you want to call it,
that they're fucking,

66
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.580
they ride on BMW's now instead of Harley Davidson's,
you know,

67
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.610
you want to talk about not patriotic,
you know,

68
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:49.000
you want to talk about people standing at a,
sitting down during an anthem.

69
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.180
Our own fucking police officers are on BMWs.

70
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.543
<v 1>MMM.</v>

71
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.440
<v 0>It's a great bike though from what I heard anyways.
Um,</v>

72
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.700
so he's just behind me,
whatever.

73
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.250
And then like we're inching along traffic inch along tried,

74
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.330
he's behind me for like five minutes now.
We make a left to get on the tent,

75
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.540
the highway,
and then all of a sudden he turns on his lights

76
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.460
and I'm sitting there going,
wow,

77
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.970
what am is after he sort of zigzag and he's on a motorcycle,

78
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.700
so it's hard to fucking tell who he's after.
So I finally just like,

79
00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:22.420
I point at myself like me,
any nods,

80
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.480
sound like I fuck is it something going on with my registration?

81
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.480
Cause at this point the u turn was like six,
seven minutes ago,

82
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:33.470
so I don't remember it.
Right?
So I fucking Polo right?

83
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.030
And the guy gets off his back,
his back of his bike right out of the gate.

84
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.640
His fucking head does not fit the helmet.

85
00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:43.820
His face is all mushed and he looks like fucking Eli Manning.

86
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.290
So I let out a chuckle before he gets up there and I'm like,
Bill,

87
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.560
get your fucking game face on.
If you're going to get out of this,

88
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.960
you can't be fucking laughing at the guy,
right?

89
00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:58.370
So he comes up with his face all fucking much to the thing and it goes,
uh,
yeah.

90
00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:02.960
Hey,
he goes,
you made an illegal u turn back there,
right?
I'm thinking,

91
00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:06.200
how the fuck did this guy see it?
Oh by the way,
the cruiser that went by me,

92
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.040
he crossed,
he made a left and just fucking pulled in a store did a big,

93
00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:12.560
you turn in the store.
The exact fucking thing that I did.

94
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.883
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.000
<v 0>So I'm sitting there going,
this mother fucker.
I know,
I know what happened.</v>

96
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:20.340
He didn't even say,
I built this whole conspiracy in my head.

97
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:22.650
I'm like this fucking mushed at face,
son of a bitch.

98
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.570
He didn't even see what I did.

99
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.040
The fucking asshole and the cruiser told them what I did and then he pulled me

100
00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:32.460
over and then I'm thinking then I fucking,
when I cooled off it's like no,

101
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:37.140
he was probably hiding right in a place I couldn't see cause people probably do

102
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:39.390
this all the time there.
It's a little fucking trap.

103
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:41.380
They make a ton of fucking money and yeah,

104
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.420
the DOPA got caught today and all he did was way too.

105
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:46.590
You got to a place where he was going to pull you over.

106
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.040
Meanwhile he ran your plate and made sure you didn't have any felonies so he

107
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:51.540
knew what you would want.
He was walking up to,

108
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.480
that's probably what the fuck happened.
So he fucking pulls up,
licensed,

109
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.230
had registration,
then I give them my insurance in the end.

110
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.630
I had the wrong insurance card in there.
Uh,
you know,
it's going down hill quick.

111
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.090
So he ended up being cool.
He came up and he was just like,
look,

112
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.520
I'm not going to write you for the insurance,
but uh,
just sign this.

113
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.310
It's an admission of guilt.
Even though I knew I was guilty,

114
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:15.140
it was fucking annoying.
Self Vietnam.
I signed the thing and he goes,

115
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.970
we try to get on the tent.
I'm like,
yeah.
He goes,

116
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.860
just go up here and make a right,
make another right go running.

117
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.900
And I appreciated that.
So it wasn't a bad guy.
All right.
But um,

118
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.640
oh that fucking,
I know.
I just,
it's,
it's,
yeah.
You know,

119
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.720
that's what easy stuck getting all that.
You start being that white guy.
Oh,

120
00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:36.830
a tax payer,
you know,
get all indignant.

121
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.300
It's like fuck head.
You broke the law.
You knew you broke the law.

122
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.520
You knew you were breaking it when you were doing it.

123
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.060
You will look in around from aren't you really just mad?

124
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.240
Aren't you really just mad that you didn't see the guy?

125
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.220
Isn't that what it is now?

126
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:55.640
The younger meek wouldn't have been able to get to that place.
So,
um,

127
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.110
that's it.
And then I just fucking drove home.
So this is my little ticket story.

128
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.580
Um,
anyways,
uh,
by the way,

129
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:08.870
on the Monday morning podcast I mentioned when I'd watched the last f one race,

130
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.010
Lewis Hamilton,

131
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:14.070
how he got those grid penalties and I didn't know what they were for a,

132
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.650
this kind of,
this is kind of interesting.

133
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.400
This is almost like a salary cap in f one a grant and Ellie read this once.

134
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.710
I'm new to this sport,
so people who've watched the sport,

135
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.120
if you want to help me out,

136
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.780
you don't have to say hey fuck head before you know you,
you correct me.

137
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.260
But basically for people that don't watch the shit,
it's kind of cool.

138
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:35.240
You're only allowed to use so many parts over the course of the year and it was

139
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:39.050
basically done to keep the price of racing down.

140
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.330
It's almost like a salary cap now to me.

141
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:46.331
I would think that Ferrari and Mercedes and the likes have like unlimited um,

142
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.270
funds but whatever.

143
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.030
So you only allowed to use so many different engine parts or whatever.

144
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.720
So Lewis Hamilton I guess had an engine or something or two or something blow

145
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.270
earlier in the season.
I Dunno what the fuck happened.
I forget.

146
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:06.800
All I know is that he used too many parts so he got an unpressed for each like

147
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:07.730
violation.

148
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:13.270
You get moved back so many places like so say you're in the pole position,

149
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.340
you're going to start number one and a,
you get dinged for,
I don't know,

150
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.150
using a fucking a,
I don't know too many radiators

151
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.730
and say that's like a f a five spot penalty.
Now you went from number one,

152
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:27.230
now you start at number six.

153
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.820
Well Hamilton's team got an unprecedented 50,

154
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.310
um,
whatever grid penalties.

155
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:40.190
So he went from all the way in the front to dead last the 25th.

156
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.800
Now here's the weird thing.
Like those,

157
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.440
those penalties don't carry over.

158
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.580
So he took all 50 only moving back 25 wiped them all off the map and the guy

159
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:55.100
went from 25th to third.
He still got on the fucking podium,

160
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.480
so they got to use all these extra parts and he really didn't pay for it.

161
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:01.800
So it was kind of a great,
uh,

162
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:06.630
it was a very shrewd move evidently by the Mercedes team.
So there you go.
See,

163
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.960
I learned a little something.
You know what else I learned?

164
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.210
This is really,
really embarrassing.
Um,

165
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:18.030
so I got on the scale like I worked out like two days in a row,

166
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:23.031
did 45 minutes of cardio both days to just knock a few pounds off before I had

167
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:25.110
the balls to do my way in.

168
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.120
Jesus Christ says biggest number I've ever put up.

169
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.780
All right.
I guess I stepped on the scale and I go,
man,

170
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:38.781
I'm feeling like a buck 83 buck 84 I was one 89.8 and I just walked the dog

171
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:44.070
around the block.
So I was over a buck 90.
I've never seen the nine.

172
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.550
<v 0>I've never seen the nine in the second position since I've been in like the</v>

174
00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:54.080
fucking seventh grade or sixth grade and I weighed 90 pounds.
Um,

175
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.700
terrifying.
And of course I got a special coming up.
So now I am um,

176
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.950
I back to eating as perfectly as I know how to and just totally working out.

177
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:07.490
And what's cool is the first week whenever you go to lose weight for people out

178
00:10:07.491 --> 00:10:10.820
there,
because I know everybody struggles with it.
That first fucking week,

179
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.310
if you go hard and you eat perfect,

180
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.910
I mean you can lose like three to four pounds easy if you're my built.

181
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.250
If you're a big motherfucker,

182
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.170
you could probably lose even more than that cause it's like a percentage of your

183
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:26.171
body weight and it's basically because your body I think is so used to laying

184
00:10:26.211 --> 00:10:27.800
around eating a cheese plate,

185
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.370
finishing off a bottle of wine like you some fucking pirate that took over

186
00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:33.680
somebody's boat.
That's the way I was living.

187
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.230
I didn't tell you guys just went on when we were in a,
the Amalfi coast in,

188
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.270
in the room,
they had a,

189
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:46.290
a bottle of Johnnie Walker black and I started just sipping on that thing like

190
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:49.430
every day,
like earlier and earlier.

191
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.450
And then I got like this weird fucking OCD slash you know,

192
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.330
played a lot of sports growing up.
So you get that competitive thing,

193
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:58.640
like this fucking bottle thinks it's going to defeat me.

194
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.820
And I just started doing a third,
a third and a third just

195
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.220
knocking it out.

196
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.970
I fucking finished two bottles when I was over there and 10 days,

197
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:10.810
man is fucking bad.
It was bad.
But Oh,

198
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.360
I had a nice glow going from,
as they say back east go dude,

199
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:20.930
I got a good glow going right from like,
uh,

200
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.790
it started started at like around 11 in the morning,
you know,

201
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.290
I'm on vacation,
fuck off.
Right.
And I would just keep this glow go and

202
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.773
<v 1>mmm.</v>

203
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.060
<v 0>Until like lunchtime.
And then I wouldn't eat for like an,</v>

204
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.400
I mean when drink for an hour or so seats start coming down and I just slam a

205
00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:43.870
couple of waters so I wouldn't get like that mild hangover.
And then,
uh,

206
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.770
we go see some shit and then I'd come back and have another couple,
two,
three.

207
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.520
Then we go out to dinner.
Oh,

208
00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:55.030
fucking Billy velvet face,
red velvet cake.

209
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:57.700
There I go outright to have some pasta.
Right.

210
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.250
As,
as you know what they kept saying,
like that was a secondary.
There's,

211
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:06.010
so I'm like,
well,
I got to go to and then once,
so I would do that.

212
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.640
And then I would also order a main course,
which by the way,

213
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:11.320
I learned on below the deck,

214
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:15.520
the way we call it an entree is stupid because that's actually the French word

215
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:17.680
for enter,
meaning basically an appetizer.

216
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.890
So the English guy on there like stop calling it an entree.

217
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:23.550
You fucking Americans.
Right?
So,
um,

218
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.140
the main course I was ordering like a,
like a fucking,
I dunno,

219
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.470
a fucking war zone or whatever,
you know,
uh,
uh,

220
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.900
Ravioli fucking Spaghetti Bolognese.

221
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.290
And then I would have some fish after that and I was fucking drinking a giant

222
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.640
bottle of wine,
you know,
I was going like,
you know,

223
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.110
rest his soul James Scandal Fini right.
I was living the fucking high life.

224
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.880
And then I'd come home and then I'd have another couple,
two or three,
right?

225
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.060
I was going Keith Richards with the shit.
And uh,

226
00:12:58.061 --> 00:12:59.920
I was kind of forgetting how many calories that was.

227
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:03.370
But every morning I get up and I'd fucking get on the elliptical for a good half

228
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.610
hour.
I'd throw the weights around and I'd swim in the Mediterranean.

229
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:08.710
I was thinking like,
and you know what the deal,

230
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:13.150
and I was thinking that I was actually keeping it at bay like I was doing all

231
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:14.620
right.
But you know that deal,

232
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:18.970
you can do an hour of cardio and if you eat two Oreo cookies,
three Oreo cookies,

233
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:22.240
you basically,
and you can eat three Oreo cookies.
You know,

234
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.090
you can meet in like the cookie monster.
You can even like eight seconds.

235
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:30.091
Or you can be a gentleman and basically eat three Oreo cookies in 90 seconds.

236
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.870
Just watching TV.
Not Thinking,
eat one,
just sit there.
I mean if you,

237
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:38.650
if you eat three Oreo cookies while not paying attention to the sleeve of

238
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.410
cookies that's next to you and it takes you 90 seconds to eat it,

239
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.670
you are a gentleman,
you are a lady,
you will raised,
right.
Okay.

240
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.780
But even then in that 90 seconds you can negate everything that you did for

241
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:54.310
fucking
an hour.
It's sucked.
So I wasn't really thinking like that.

242
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:58.810
So I came back and I was one 89.8 so I've been fucking hitting it hard.

243
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.480
Got on the scale today.
I was one 86.2.
Um,

244
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.890
and uh,
I got to get down to my,
I got to get down to about a buck,
70 bucks,

245
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:11.620
72 for my special.
So that's what I'm doing.

246
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.760
And now I'm just driving by liquor stores.
And last night it took Nia out.

247
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.430
You know,
we had a great night,
great summer night out here.

248
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:21.070
I took her out to get some gelato and she,

249
00:14:21.071 --> 00:14:23.800
and I was like literally staying in the car cause it's like I'm not going to go

250
00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:24.071
in there.

251
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:27.310
I'm not going into the crack store is a crackhead and fucking say I don't want

252
00:14:27.311 --> 00:14:31.170
any crack.
That's not gonna work.
Right.
But she did the woman thing like,
you know,

253
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.740
if it's not,
give any fun,
if I go in there by myself,
so I'm like,
fuck,
all right.

254
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.580
I go,
go in and I'll fucking drive around the car.
So I drive around the block,

255
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.010
fucking park,
the old Prius,
right.
And we're fucking go in there and like,

256
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.900
it's just the smell,
the smell of sugar in the air.

257
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.870
It was like so palpable.
I can't,

258
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.570
I can't believe I wasn't like literally like feeling the grains of it,

259
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:57.950
but the granule texture of it going up my fucking nose.
And um,

260
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.160
I was just like,
no,
I'm good,
I'm good.
She's like,
you sure you just want to bite?

261
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.810
I was like,
no,
no,
I'm a crackhead.
You fucking,

262
00:15:06.811 --> 00:15:09.690
you just want to take one hit off the pipe.
It's like,
no,
I'm gonna be back on it.

263
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.850
So I just sat there,
white knuckling it.

264
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.630
Fortunately there was this young couple that had a little puppy,

265
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.800
a Weimer Reimer hubby say it.
So I got to play with that thing a little bit,

266
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.350
but then I look over in the corner and they had fucking,
um,

267
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.170
they had like roots bear,
which is my favorite,
you know,
other than that,

268
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:30.810
than the orange fant at the Mexican one with the real fucking sugar.
Alright.

269
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.190
What truly makes me nervous about the wall that Trump wants to build?
I mean,

270
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:35.990
does that mean that we don't get the real coke?

271
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.430
You know what the real sugar in it as opposed to the fucking hybrid sugar that

272
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:42.800
they've been putting in our shit since the late seventies.

273
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.940
And whenever the fuck they did it,
I didn't research it.
Um,
but I,

274
00:15:47.941 --> 00:15:51.220
I was able to,
uh,
I was able to get out of there.

275
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.460
Then we just took the dog for a walk while she ate an ice cream.
Good,
clean,
fun.

276
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.830
I came home and by then I was already going like,
uh,
so like Tequila,

277
00:15:59.831 --> 00:16:01.840
Tequila doesn't have a lot of calories,
right?

278
00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:05.950
If you have like a Tequila with like a little bit of lime and my wife's gone no,

279
00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:10.750
and she was laughing.
She goes,
look at you cave in already and uh,
she goes,

280
00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:13.030
I thought it was vodka.
I don't know which one.
Right?

281
00:16:13.031 --> 00:16:18.031
So I'm sitting there and I'm standing and staring at my fucking liquor cabinet,

282
00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:23.950
which I would put up against the 96 balls,

283
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.000
the 86 Celtics,
the 85 Lakers,

284
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.980
the 1927 Yankees.

285
00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:34.690
I would put my bottles up against that.
Huh?

286
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.700
You want to go Babe Ruth Lou Gehrig?
I got fucking uh,
uh,

287
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.830
I got pappy van Winkle.
I got fucking Johnny Walker blue.

288
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.820
I got this fucking top of the shelf Tequila having looked like I don't fuck

289
00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:49.121
around.

290
00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:52.480
Like that's what I like is because I don't want to drink and drive or anything.

291
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.150
And I also don't want to go out to fucking bars at this point.

292
00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:58.780
I'm too fucking old.
So what I like what helps us,

293
00:16:58.781 --> 00:17:00.670
if you buy top of the line booze,

294
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.860
you just sitting at home like why would I go out to pay 10 times more for

295
00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:07.540
fucking 10 times less?
Right.

296
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.270
Why would I go out for a hamburger when I got steak at home kid?

297
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:11.950
So I'm looking at this,

298
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.610
it's like the fucking Oscar red carpet

299
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.170
of fucking bottles of booze.
You know,

300
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:24.040
I've got some bullshit and then I got some bullshit for like when I want to get

301
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:27.340
fucked up.
You know what I mean?
When I'm going to get fucked up,
it's basically,

302
00:17:27.341 --> 00:17:27.551
well,

303
00:17:27.551 --> 00:17:30.610
I'll take you through my fucking alcoholism here when I want to get fucked up.

304
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.340
When?
Oh,
Billy bread cakes wants to get fucked up.

305
00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.950
I like a little maker's mark.

306
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.940
You don't give a shit like maker's mark is like the Mississippi River.
I mean,

307
00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:42.670
it's never going to run out.
It just keeps coming down the pipe.

308
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.690
You know what I mean?
The other shit is full,
like special occasions,
you know?

309
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.400
So I'll drink or Johnny Walker black.

310
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.173
<v 1>MMM.</v>

311
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.960
<v 0>What else are patrones silver?
You know,
I've got a lime tree out the front yard.</v>

312
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:00.660
It's one of the greatest things about living in La is you can have a lime tree.

313
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.240
You know what I mean?
And the honestly,
you just like,

314
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:05.790
how much fucking Guacamole can I make here?
You know,

315
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.210
I either got to get some sort of drinking habit or a,

316
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.430
these things are all going to go to waste.
I'll tell you right now,

317
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:13.410
you get a giant fucking square ice cube.

318
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.420
How thirsty am I making the fucking [inaudible] right now you get a giant square

319
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:22.170
fucking ice cube and you stick that in a high ball glass.

320
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.040
You pour a high quality fucking Tequila over the top of that,
right.

321
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:29.310
And you squeeze of freshly picked fucking lime off your tree.

322
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.860
You go out on your porch on a hot summer day and you drink that fucking thing.

323
00:18:33.861 --> 00:18:38.000
I swear to God
it's over man.

324
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.670
It's over.
You just,
I don't know what you feel like.
You feel like you're,

325
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.580
it's the 18 hundreds,
you know,

326
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.390
which I don't want to make people who aren't white get all on nervous cause that

327
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:51.430
was not a good time for them.
But for a white guy,
you know,
it was,

328
00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:52.680
it was pretty cool.
You know,

329
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:56.160
thinks it's settled down with the people who used to be there who now weren't,

330
00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.930
uh,
you could come rolling in afterwards,
get yourself a spread,
right.

331
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.560
Sit out there.
Would you be drinking Tequila though?
I don't fucking know.

332
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.810
You know,
there really is like 52 versions
of us history.

333
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.590
It all depends on who tells it and how you remember it and how fondly or on

334
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:18.450
fondly you remember it.
Um,
anyways,
so I,

335
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.140
but I sat there staring at it.
I was like,
no,
not tonight.
Maybe tomorrow.

336
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.900
If you want to have a drink,
have it tomorrow.
And I went to fucking bed,

337
00:19:24.901 --> 00:19:27.780
I had a little bit of water and then that was it.
And uh,

338
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:32.120
I'm glad I didn't give into the fucking ice cream.
I didn't give into the booze.

339
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.620
I thought Jesus Christ,

340
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:39.621
I had a fucking Turkey slices with a set with and it was the fucking like,

341
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.690
whoa.
Like they took it out of the oven kind of Turkey.
All right.

342
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.960
Not The fucking filled with salt,
cold cut Turkey.

343
00:19:46.961 --> 00:19:48.360
It was right out of the oven Turkey.

344
00:19:48.361 --> 00:19:52.710
So basically I had a Turkey that probably had its beak cut off and it was pumped

345
00:19:52.711 --> 00:19:54.010
with some sort of cow hormones.

346
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.190
So that's about as healthy as you can get nowadays.

347
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.600
Um,
but anyways,
I got to fucking turn this,
I got to turn the ship around here.

348
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.123
Um,

349
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.610
so I got to go hard here over the next month and being at home is not going to

350
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:12.930
be a difficult thing,
but it's going to be difficult when,
uh,
I'm on the road,

351
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.200
which by the way,
you didn't ask,
uh,

352
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.670
next week I will be on the road and uh,
I'm doing the makeup show,

353
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.190
that long island show out on long island.

354
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:26.160
This was the one that I was supposed to do back in,

355
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:29.190
I believe January when I was coming back,
he used to do the uh,

356
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.640
Patrice O'Neal benefit and uh,

357
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:35.790
unfortunately there was so much snow back there and there was like three days

358
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:38.820
worth of backed up flights I just couldn't get in so I had to reschedule it.

359
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.070
So now I am finally coming back and that is going down on,
uh,

360
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.880
September 7th.
And um,
hopefully my website will load here.

361
00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.900
All right.
And then after that I go to Charleston,
South Carolina,

362
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.930
one of the greatest and most underrated cities in the United States of America,

363
00:20:58.061 --> 00:21:01.240
Charleston,
South Carolina.
Okay.

364
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.630
If you're a little bit older and your kids are out of the fucking house,

365
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:06.250
or if you're an old soul like me,

366
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.240
that is a fucking great place to take your lady.

367
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.820
It is.
It's unbelievable,
right along the water.

368
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.920
And it's just like,
it's,
it's the old south,

369
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.341
you know,

370
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:24.880
when Hollywood makes movies about the old south and they just sort of ignore

371
00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:27.670
slavery,
you know,
those,
that's what it looks like.

372
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.340
There's nothing horrific going on.
It's just the charming houses,

373
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.060
the amazing fucking weather and that laid back vibe.

374
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:40.840
And you just walk around the town.
It's absolutely fucking gorgeous.

375
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.090
It's Mayberry,
right?
And there's,

376
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.510
there's some sort of wine place there that has cigars in the back.

377
00:21:46.511 --> 00:21:50.740
And I remember being there.
It was me versus Jason Law,
hadn't his dad,

378
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.410
the legendary Jim Lawhead hall of fame,
High School Basketball Court coach.
Um,

379
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.540
we,
uh,
we all sat out smoking cigars and having a glass of wine just out on the

380
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:05.140
sidewalk telling stories in my head was killing us,

381
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:06.760
just fucking act and out all the stories.

382
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:10.060
It's just one of the great fucking nights on the road I've ever had,

383
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:14.480
so very excited to come back there.
Then I go in to Charlotte,
North Carolina.

384
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

385
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.670
<v 0>Charlotte International,
same Sprague white there for a while.</v>

386
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.240
Oh,
is it three wives?
That's when everybody gets excited and they stand up.

387
00:22:24.241 --> 00:22:28.920
We'll go to see a Rick,
um,
Charlotte,

388
00:22:28.921 --> 00:22:33.430
North Carolina and a home of the great ric flair.
Woo.

389
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.710
Um,
then I go up to Chrysler Hall in Norfolk,
Virginia.

390
00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.390
And uh,
after that,
I think I'm in Richmond.
Let me click here.

391
00:22:42.391 --> 00:22:46.950
Richmond on September 11th.
Never Forget.
Um,

392
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.740
and that's September 11th.
So that's the deal right there.

393
00:22:49.741 --> 00:22:53.810
I'm doing a quick little run there through the south and I might have to take

394
00:22:53.811 --> 00:22:55.380
you through all my dates here.
Um,

395
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:56.760
<v 2>okay.</v>

396
00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.290
<v 0>Then I'm going the next week,
September 15th,
16th,
I'm in Durham,
North Carolina.</v>

397
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.850
Oh,
15,
16,
17.
Now would you look at that?
Madison,
Wisconsin,

398
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.910
uh,
the 29th,
impossibly the 30th,

399
00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:13.430
and then I'm in Omaha,
Nebraska on the first,
and guess what?

400
00:23:13.431 --> 00:23:18.320
The Nebraska Cornhuskers.
Okay.
It ain't going to be swapping some paint.

401
00:23:18.321 --> 00:23:21.350
What that fight and the lion,
I no way down in Lincoln.

402
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.580
So I'm with Nick Craig on that one.
And we're going to,
uh,

403
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.970
we're going to fly in early and we're going to drive down and make sure that we

404
00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:31.200
hit that game.
I've always wanted to go to Nebraska game.
Um,

405
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.580
I believe lovies Lovie Smith is with Illinois.
Who the fucking,

406
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.320
I know Nebraska got a good coach,
then they get an NFL coach.

407
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.740
I know back in the day they got that dude from the Raiders and it didn't fucking

408
00:23:40.741 --> 00:23:43.560
work out,
but,
um,
you know,

409
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.500
Nebraska was up powerhouse,
uh,

410
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.360
when I was a kid for a long fucking time.

411
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:55.010
And actually one of the best college championship games I saw was when,
uh,

412
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.690
the Miami hurricanes beat.
I'm like right in the end,
you know,

413
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:03.980
with Jimmy Johnson,
I'm not damn capitalists.
Right.
And,
uh,

414
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.790
so they,
I,
I just remember all of those guys turn a Gill,

415
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.410
Mike Rozier all that.
So they got a guy,
Mike Riley.
I don't know who that guy is.

416
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.930
Who the fuck is Mike Riley?
Uh,
I dunno.
Hopefully he's a good coach.

417

443
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:10.250
You fat fucking fucking Flus.

444
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.130
You fucking stomach hangs over your underwear.

445
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.170
You don't care cause it's nice and soft.

446
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.550
Your balls get cradled like you're in the womb when you put on a pair of me on

447
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:22.590
these.
Oh yeah,
they won't write up your ass.
And Lynn,

448
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.780
she wanted okay me undies.
Uh,

449
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.220
whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

450
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.670
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear unless you're Matthew

451
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:32.504
mcconaughey.

452
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.730
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

453
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.330
clothes,
your underwear is probably boring beyond aces.
Kier to change that.

454
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.590
What if you get a blow job,
right?

455
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:47.250
You're going to get one the lady down to customer service,
your wore her down.

456
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:47.850
She's like,

457
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.810
<v 2>bye bye.</v>

458
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.940
<v 0>I'll meet you in the fucking Unisex bathroom,
right?</v>

459
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:56.970
She goes to take down your fucking dockers and then you're just standing there

460
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:01.530
in a pair of tighty whities or maybe just a regular pair of fucking gray,
uh,

461
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.700
boxes that you got at the gap.
And she starts having second thoughts going,
well,

462
00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:07.920
this is just another dick on the fucking resume.

463
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.520
I don't need this with the social pressures of,
you know,

464
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:15.420
what is the number where I start to become a whore,
why will it is my body?

465
00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:18.390
And she starts having all that and meanwhile you dick standing over there like,

466
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:21.630
hey,
can we have a little fucking help over here?
And the whole thing goes away.

467
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.140
Well,
me undies is here to change that.
Um,

468
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.010
every pair of meundies is made from sustainable source modal modal of fabric

469
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:31.110
that is twice as soft as cotton.

470
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.450
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies.
But once you try them on,

471
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.310
you'll understand why they are called.
The world's most complex.

472
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.760
<v 3>Well,
underwear,
underwear,
underwear.</v>

473
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.730
<v 0>Yay.
Yay.
Yeah.
And if you don't love your first pair of undies,
they're free.</v>

474
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.920
No questions asked beyond.
He's has dozens of styles.
Oh my God.

475
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:54.921
Look at that one and limited edition prints to help you make a statement with

476
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:59.190
you,
Rhonda.
Where uh,
whether you or anyone,
anyone can see them or not.

477
00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:04.110
Remember Superman.
I,
to me,
that's their code of saying,
remember,
you know,

478
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.160
you're going to get your dick sucked at some point,
right?
You know,

479
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.900

Baba,

481
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.920
<v 3>Well,
but um,</v>

482
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.250
<v 0>right.
That's what she wants to see.
Little fireworks down there.</v>

483
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.600
You know what I mean?
You know,
broad stuff.
You could have the shittiest car.

484
00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:32.580
If you've got a nice interior,
all of a sudden that you know,

Hey,

491
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.010
Yonnie's dot com slash bar by the way,
you know what that reminds me of?

492
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.940
I have a bone to pick with my wife.
You know,
I,

493
00:28:58.941 --> 00:29:01.830
I subscribe to Rolling Stone magazine.
Okay.

494
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.860
And this sounds like I'm just telling a story while actually making money off

495
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:08.790
those cons.
I'm not so,
um,

496
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.590
you know,
fucking,
uh,
the,
the magazine comes today and it said,

497
00:29:14.591 --> 00:29:19.370
fucking guy does the talk show who fucking drives around with a Dell and he sing

498
00:29:19.371 --> 00:29:23.930
songs and shit.
You know what I mean?
It's very like musical theater,
like,

499
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:28.810
like a slumber party can break out at any second.
Okay.
Uh,

500
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:33.820
so he's on the cover,
essentially.
Looks like he's not wearing any clothes.

501
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:38.020
He's laying stomach down,
holding like a little sock teddy bear.

502
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.080
You know what I mean?
You know that today's

503
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:51.530
how we went from Lee Marvin to that.
I don't know what the fuck happened.
Right?

504
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.370
So there's that dude and I'm fucking cracking up going like,

505
00:29:55.371 --> 00:29:59.330
how hard is this guy working his female audience?
Jesus Christ.

506
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:04.430
He is the key.
It have just been like a bubble over his head going,
oh my God,

507
00:30:04.431 --> 00:30:08.960
you guys right?
Because he's fucking eating some pudding.

508
00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.120
So anyways,
um,

509
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.550
<v 2>okay.</v>

510
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.420
<v 0>I'm just sitting there laughing and,
and Nia is cracking up too.</v>

511
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.190
They're not making,
you know,
I don't,
I don't give a shit.

512
00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:20.380
That's how he wants to live his life.
God bless him.
You know what I mean?

513
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:24.910
But this,
it's fucking hilarious.
Maybe that's,
maybe that was the purpose.
Okay.

514
00:30:24.911 --> 00:30:28.600
But anyways,
so somehow we talk about it and she said,
well,

515
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:33.010
last week Jared Leto was shirtless on the cover

516
00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.060
and I'm going,
really,
really,
I don't remember seeing that fucking issue.

517
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.680
She fucking swiped it.
Um,
I'm really talking shit here.

518
00:30:42.681 --> 00:30:44.220
I'm going to have to bring her in for this.
And I was like,
well,

519
00:30:44.221 --> 00:30:46.950
what'd you do with it after you?
She goes,
well I just spread the article.

520
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:51.910
I was like,
I bet you did.
You fucking animal.
Um,

521
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.450
so there you go.
So my wife is,

522
00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:59.080
I think mentally cheating on me with fucking Jared.
Let them and you know,

523
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:02.470
what can you honors?
Can you get mad though?
I mean that,

524
00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:04.260
that would be really hypocritical of me cause you know,

525
00:31:04.261 --> 00:31:07.080
if I see a girl with a fat ass and some titties coming down the street,
you know,

526
00:31:07.081 --> 00:31:10.290
I'm going to literally almost break my neck turning around to look at it right

527
00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:12.630
in front of me.
And I always say,
well,
what do you want me to do?

528
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.580
Why don't you want me to sit here and be like all these other guys and fucking,

529
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.920
you know,
out of the corner of my eye,

530
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:24.570
like literally like strained my fucking whatever.
My,
my,
the Aclo your eye,

531
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.650
whatever the fuck that's called you a little I tendon looking at,
you know.

532
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:30.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

533
00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.170
<v 0>I've been telling for years.
I think if you see a good looking guy,</v>

534
00:31:33.171 --> 00:31:36.050
just look at them.
I don't,
I know what I look like.

535
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.820
I know where I am in the scale of one to 10 I'm in the middle of the pack,
right?

536
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.060
Lance is upfront.
I'm fucking in the back,
you know,

537
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.810
with all those other fucking people,
you know.
And the,
the,
the pendulum,

538
00:31:47.811 --> 00:31:52.460
whatever the fuck they call it.
I don't understand those people.

539
00:31:52.461 --> 00:31:54.170
They really gotta to be sitting in the middle of the pack and go,

540
00:31:54.171 --> 00:31:56.960
why are we doing this to ourselves again?
You know,

541
00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:01.700
why are our legs like 15 [inaudible],
15 sizes?
The size of our arms?

542
00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.880
People who ride on bicycles for a living,
it's fucking unbelievable.

543
00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:08.750
Like their legs look like Wiley Coyote when he took that acme shit,

544
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.280
he drank those pills.

545
00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:13.670
It's one of my favorite ones where he runs really fast and it's just the flames

546
00:32:13.671 --> 00:32:16.430
going down the fucking road.
That was the shit.
But like,

547
00:32:16.431 --> 00:32:19.760
it did nothing for his upper body.
That's what,
uh,
the p,

548
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.420
the guys in the Tour de France look like,
you know,

549
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:26.070
their arms looked like little seventh grade arms.
You know,
like everybody,

550
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.200
my grades is taller than me.
Mom,
that's what their arms look like.
But their legs,

551
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:33.350
they looked like Earl Campbell.
Um,
I don't,

552
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.730
what am I talking about here anyways?
Yeah,
I was saying,
you know,
so I,
you know,

553
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.620
it's like,
I don't mind that you went and fucking,
you know,
fucking curled up.

554
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:47.030
We'll get a little Jared Leto Leto Letell modal fucking magazine cover.

555
00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:50.940
But you know,
you don't got to sneeze ground.
You can see that.
Okay,
Bill,

556
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.130
this guy is way better looking than you.

557
00:32:53.131 --> 00:32:57.030
So I'm going to go downstairs privately and look at this.
I get it.

558
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.880
Selfie.
That'd be once in a while,
right?
Um,

559
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.640
anyways,
what are we up to here?
Oh,
33 minutes.
Guess what?

560
00:33:07.641 --> 00:33:09.800
I did my fucking job for the week.
By the way,

561
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:14.510
if you would like to contribute to this podcast without really having to

562
00:33:14.511 --> 00:33:17.310
contribute,
the easiest way to do it is to uh,

563
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:22.370
go to [inaudible] dot com click on the homepage and then you click on the link

564
00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:25.280
to Amazon and then he go there.
If you buy something,

565
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:27.350
I get credit for driving traffic there.

566
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:29.480
So next time you're going to buy something on Amazon,

567
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.770
if you'd like to donate a little bit to the podcast,

568
00:33:31.771 --> 00:33:36.560
if I made you laugh or whatever,
um,
I would appreciate it if you doubt.

569
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:39.050
I mean it is an extra step.
It is kind of a pain in the ass.

570
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:42.500
And who's kitten know you're busy,
you got your own life.
I get it.
But you know,

571
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:45.320
if you've got time I waited,
we'd appreciate it.
All right,

572
00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:47.870
so that's the Thursday afternoon podcast here for this week.

573
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:50.930
Thank you everybody for listening.
Um,
I will,

574
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.280
I'm going to be fucking 183 pounds by next week.

575
00:33:55.310 --> 00:34:00.140
That's what I'm doing right now.
When 86,
I'm supposed to be one 86 by Tuesday.

576
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.250
That's how it works in every Tuesday.
I have a way in every Tuesday like the UFC,

577
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:08.450
except I'm not tough,
tough and I'm not fighting.
Right.
So one 86,

578
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:12.640
then one 83,
then one 81 77,
one 74,

579
00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:16.610
one 71.
And then I'll be right up against the special.
If I just,
you know,

580
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:20.570
sorta go easy that fucking week I can be about one 71 71.

581
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:23.990
That'll be fucking perfect.
And I'll come out there looking like a champ,

582
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.080
you know,
and then we'll see how that jokes hold up.

583
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.180
And even if you don't like the jokes just said,
God damn it.

584
00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:31.810
He was really fit as a fiddle.
He would fit as a fiddle.
I got you.

585
00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:36.490
Got to give him that.
All right.
Enjoy the music here as we transition it to a,

586
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:37.324
uh,

587
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:42.570
some greatest hits of the Monday morning podcasts from a podcast gone by in a

588
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.220
year that's already happening.
Or maybe it's this year,
but the shifts

589
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.640
<v 4>going
back,</v>

590
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.000
<v 0>I actually went to church this week.
Oh,</v>

591
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:38.190
I went there and the second I walk in,
I just can't,
like I,
I buy into any of it.

592
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:44.280
I went with a,
I went with Nias mom,
we went to church.

593
00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:46.630
And uh,

594
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:50.800
what I try to do when I go in there was it go above all of it and try to like,

595
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.200
you know,
connect with something like Whoopi Goldberg and ghost,
you know,

596
00:35:56.201 --> 00:35:59.200
try to connect with something else other than what this,

597
00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.900
like literally what they're preaching.
It's like,

598
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.360
<v 2>okay,</v>

599
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.440
<v 0>I ain't know</v>

600
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.820
you guys had the holy wars.
You had the fucking inquisition.
I mean,
you,

601
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.900
you fucking

602
00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:13.860
<v 2>okay.</v>

603
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.870
<v 0>You don't want Jewish people after World War II.</v>

604
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.430
We're trying to get this shit back.

605
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.550
Like the amount of stuff that went into the Vatican,
I mean,

606
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.120
you would down with the Nazis.
Like how is this plate?
Like,

607
00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:30.160
how did Penn state lose all those victories,
right?

608
00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.000
Lost all those victories.
And what happened to the Catholic Church?
You know,
I've,

609
00:36:34.001 --> 00:36:36.070
I've talked about this a zillion fucking types.

610
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.540
They have broken on a global level,

611
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.290
every major fucking commandment that there is,

612
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.650
and they just sit there.
Yeah,

613
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.480
<v 5>holy,
holy,
holy,
blah,</v>

614
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.920
blah,
blah.

615
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.860
<v 0>Fucking tell me how to live my life.
Um,
yeah,</v>

616
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.840
just don't buy into it.
And then the money basset came around.
I'm like,

617
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.720
I've given these motherfuckers shit
as with Nina's mom.
And I was like,
ah,

618
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:11.020
I don't want to be an asshole in front of us.

619
00:37:11.021 --> 00:37:12.970
I threw five bucks in their five bucks.

620
00:37:12.971 --> 00:37:17.971
I just paid $5 for the fucking defense attorney in a pedophile case kind of ag

621
00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.000
telling me I'm not going to hell right then for being so goddamn stupid.

622
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

623
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.090
<v 0>Yeah.
Who was a,</v>

624
00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:26.893
<v 2>okay.</v>

625
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.420
<v 0>And they had the guy,
they had the,</v>

626
00:37:28.421 --> 00:37:33.421
this Irish tenor guy who was singing all the songs keep and behind it and he

627
00:37:33.521 --> 00:37:34.930
would do like this big conducting thing.

628
00:37:34.931 --> 00:37:37.240
He was like totally fucking into it to get the crowd going.
Right.

629
00:37:37.241 --> 00:37:40.990
He had this awful suit on.
It didn't fit them,
you know,

630
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.360
looks like he ate donuts and shit and they stay in the guy in the,

631
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.280
the preacher gave him a fucking shout out.
He goes this week,
uh,

632
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:57.180
we would like to extend a congratulation to a,
that guy over there.

633
00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:02.190
It can't fit into a sport coat for 20 years of sagging songs,

634
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:03.870
hair.
This judge said,

635
00:38:03.871 --> 00:38:08.100
I want to say here's to another 50 years,

636
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.870
Eric,
this church,
nobody clapping and it's like he's going to be dead at 50

637
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:17.800
we're all going to be,
I'll be dead.
Well,
maybe not right.

638
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.830
94 would fit here with dentures.

639
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.050
That's going to be a sad fucking day.

640
00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:31.030
Me fucking wheel in my ass under the stage.
Fucking at 94 years old.

641
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.260
You know somebody with a Jetsons haircut me for the show.

642
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.280
Do you still enjoy it?
Do you still a Jew

643
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:44.240
<v 6>every night that I could get out there bigger Chabot,</v>

644
00:38:44.241 --> 00:38:45.340
the people's faces.

645
00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.533
<v 1>MMM.</v>

646
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.290
<v 0>Fucking sitting there instead of like bottled water backstage.</v>

647
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.580
I'll have like vital organs being grown to be inserted in me before I go out

648
00:38:57.581 --> 00:39:01.900
there.
That's like the level of a,
Oh no,
that won't be available to me.

649
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.020
Dick Cheney.
You'll have that shit.
He'll still be walking around here.

650
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.133
<v 1>MMM.</v>

651
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.020
<v 0>And it was for the fuck was I just talking about?
Oh yeah.</v>

652
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:15.850
For another 50 years there at that jr he's going to be dead.
Look at him.

653
00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.450
<v 2>Okay.</v>

654
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.820
<v 0>He's like 40 pounds over fucking weight.</v>

655
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:25.370
He's sliding into 50 and about 90 miles an hour without a helmet on the way this

656
00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:27.410
guy's fucking eat and he's not,
he's not gonna make it.

657
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:32.660
He probably has some fucking horrific collection of porn.

658
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.010
He's not wearing a wedding ring.
This fucking,
he's sweaty like,

659
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:38.740
<v 2>okay,</v>

660
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.150
<v 0>what is he doing this sad?
He has no fucking life.
I feel bad for him.</v>

661
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.450
Let's get him a haircut.
Get him a gym membership,

662
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.840
and how will we make the last seven years of his fucking life enjoyable?

663
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.540
How about that?
Why don't we go out and get a harlot for this guy?

664
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.533
<v 1>You know,</v>

665
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:59.730
<v 0>the physical equivalent to a dozen donuts.
He'll be able to relate,
you know?</v>

666
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:01.643
<v 2>Okay.</v>

667
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.710
<v 0>I'm not even saying any of that's true people.</v>

668
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.190
That's just what was going through my head when I was there.

669
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.280
There was some guy in the pew hate that Word Pew in front of me and he just

670
00:40:13.611 --> 00:40:18.500
looked like an evil motherfucker,
you know,
he was balding.
He was like in his,

671
00:40:18.501 --> 00:40:23.390
uh,
he was like pushing 60.
He was Tan,

672
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.730
he had fucking balding,
but he still is dying.
His hair,
jet black.

673
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.620
And he had a pinky ring and a bracelet on right there.
Pinky ring and a bracelet.

674
00:40:33.621 --> 00:40:37.670
You're dishonest motherfucker.
All right.
Unless you're a check.

675
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.100
If you're a guy and you're wearing that.

676
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:40.670
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

677
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:45.350
<v 0>You know that Dr Vinnie Boom Bots fucking outfit.
That's it.</v>

678
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:48.950
You're a piece of shit.
And he just,
oh he looked over at me.
Peace be with you.

679
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:54.350
I want to be like fuck you
now.
What do you mean what?
You know what it's for.

680
00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:57.870
If whatever the fuck you did for since last Sunday with your pinkie ring and

681
00:40:57.871 --> 00:41:01.620
your bracelet.
Oh Jesus Christ.
I think I was just sitting there judging people.

682
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.590
You know,
they had all two girls,
you know,

683
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.170
set of the altar boys just to keep the priest honest,
you know,

684
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.520
which I thought was brilliant.

685
00:41:13.521 --> 00:41:18.521
That's a brilliant way to keep them away from little boys is to let girls do it.

686
00:41:19.011 --> 00:41:20.960
Cause they were all girls.
There was no boys there.

687
00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.210
What else can I trash about it?

688
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.090
I can't remember.
You know,
I,
I,

689
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.610
he gave the homily and I didn't remember one fucking thing that he said he

690
00:41:32.611 --> 00:41:37.010
wasn't,
well,
I couldn't understand what he's saying.
I know that was my,

691
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:38.990
that was my little trip to fucking church.
But I went,

692
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:40.490
<v 4>yeah.</v>

693
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:44.420
<v 0>But I went and I actually saw the confessionals and I was thinking,
Jesus,</v>

694
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:48.350
this shit that I have to get off my chest.
And then,

695
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:51.110
but then I always think like,
what the fuck do I want to tell this guy?

696
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.550
<v 4>Okay,</v>

697
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.180
<v 0>why do I gotta go in there and tell it to you?
And then it goes,
yeah.</v>

698
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.640
Then you run it up the fucking line,

699
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.863
<v 4>you know,</v>

700
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.080
<v 0>fucking Weirdo.
You just want to hear all the bad shit that I did.</v>

701
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.050
Cause you're not allowed to go out and fucking bang a broad ah,

702
00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:12.920
Jesus bill.
You just,
you're just,

703
00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:16.310
you're just going over old fucking points you've already made.
We get it.

704
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.050
You don't like to shit.

705
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:32.580
<v 4>No.</v>

706
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.203
Yeah.

707
00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.170
Hey,
what's going on?

708
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:23.140
<v 7>It's the Monday morning podcast and I'm doing it on Tuesday because,</v>

709
00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.500
uh,
but you know what,

710
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.470
I did one yesterday and I was in the,

711
00:43:29.471 --> 00:43:34.390
I was in an airport again and uh,
it just sucked.
That's what happened.

712
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.370
It started off good.
You know what I mean?

713
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:41.060
And then it was like evil Knievel when he was jumping the snake river,
you know,

714
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.670
and they fucking,
uh,
they let them off,
you know,
and he went across,
you're like,

715
00:43:45.671 --> 00:43:47.770
Holy Shit,
he's going to make as good a past.

716
00:43:47.771 --> 00:43:50.440
She came out and he just fucking went straight down.
So that's what happened.

717
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.850
He went right to the fucking river and somehow all we got was a bloody nose.
Um,

718
00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.370
that's what happened to me yesterday.
I went to do the podcast,
um,

719
00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:05.830
as I was waiting to get on my jet blue flight,
exit row is all set.

720
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.970
Everything was great.
And uh,
you know,

721
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.890
all of a sudden they said that we were switching planes.

722
00:44:11.891 --> 00:44:14.440
We had to get off the fucking plane.
That's what happened.

723
00:44:14.441 --> 00:44:16.990
Then I was in the terminal and then I was pissing in airport again.

724
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.710
And how many times have I done that on my podcast?
Oh,
I'm bill [inaudible],

725
00:44:20.711 --> 00:44:23.710
I'm in an airport.
I'm not happy.
You know what I mean?

726
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:28.280
Did he really want to fucking hear that story again?
And uh,

727
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.010
so I was getting self conscious about that.
That's what happened.

728
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.110
Now that that's the real thing,
that's what happened.

729
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:38.790
Then I got self conscious about it,
which made me lose my train of thought.

730
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.340
And the whole thing lost it's fucking momentum.

731
00:44:41.341 --> 00:44:44.970
And the whole podcast went right down to the snake river and that's what

732
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:45.870
happened.
Okay.

733
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.520
And my nose was bleeding on the plane and everybody thought I was doing coke and

734
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:53.730
I was trying to say that I wasn't.
And then the stewardess was just like,

735
00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:56.130
is there a problem sir?
Is there a problem?
You know,

736
00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.210
she waived the Patriot Act and my face.
Um,
all right.

737
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:04.830
So anyways,
uh,
this bill Burroughs I mentioned at the top of the poor,
cursed,

738
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:09.120
it's,
you're new to my page.
I do one of these every single Monday.
All right.

739
00:45:09.121 --> 00:45:12.060
And I have to think that somebody is new to my page because a,

740
00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.750
I had my big fancy special,
uh,
Sunday night.

741
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.200
Why do I do this on comedy central?
And if I had half a brain,

742
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:24.230
I could give you some times as to when it's going to be replaying again,

743
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.640
which of course I don't know.
But um,

744
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:31.200
I watched three seconds of it cause I can't stand looking at myself and I

745
00:45:31.201 --> 00:45:35.460
thought it looked fucking awesome and uh,
I was happy with it and I want to,

746
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.130
before I get into my bitch and for the week and all that shit,

747
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:41.850
which I really can't because I'm a really happy about my special so there won't

748
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:45.180
be a lot of bitching.
I shouldn't have said that.
Cause then you know,

749
00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:48.170
by the end of this thing will be fucking bitching about something.
But um,

750
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.480
I just want to thank everybody who,
uh,

751
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:54.560
sent me emails telling me how much they liked it.
Um,
uh,

752
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.730
that really means a lot to me and I got to tell you something,
man,

753
00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.300
I don't know about other comics,
but I freak right before those things come out.

754
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:03.930
You know what I mean?
And I sit there and thinking like,
oh my God,

755
00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:06.450
what if everybody thinks it sucks?
And I'm like,
no,
don't do it.
It's good.

756
00:46:06.451 --> 00:46:09.430
It's good.
Right?
You liked it.
You saw it.
And I know of a little what if,

757
00:46:09.431 --> 00:46:11.790
what if people are fucking,
I stopped playing that mental tenants,
you know,

758
00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:16.080
as I'm standing in a Blimpie or some way trying to think what kind of bread I

759
00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:18.840
want to get when it's really all the same kind of fucking bread.

760
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:24.120
I like how they got that little fucking little oven.
They're like,
they're like,

761
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:26.340
it's the old country,
like you're in Europe.
Oh Wow.

762
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:30.720
And they're baking bread there and say,
ah,
it's just such a fucking scam.

763
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.770
Look at me.
I'm already pitching now.
Let's keep it happy.
Keep it happy.
So yeah.

764
00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:37.770
So basically,
yeah,
it was kind of freaking,
you know,

765
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:42.710
you want people to like what you do.
And,
uh,

766
00:46:42.711 --> 00:46:46.260
if I liked who I was as a person and I was comfortable with myself,

767
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:50.340
I would have no need to get on a stage and act like a jackass for a fucking hour

768
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:54.960
for other people's approval that I've never even met.
Okay.
So they go,
so that,

769
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:58.150
so anybody who was going to ask me that question like Joe,

770
00:46:58.151 --> 00:47:02.530
do you get free jar right?
The full,
you have like a special coming out,
like,

771
00:47:02.531 --> 00:47:06.750
do you know what I mean?
Like totally rolling on the floor.
Laughing my ass off.

772
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.880
Uh,
yes.
Yes I do.

773
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:14.030
I do like totally fucking freak out.
Um,

774
00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:18.210
all right.
Okay.
So anyways,
before I get going here with the podcast,

775
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:21.300
which is a day late and hopefully not a dollar short,

776
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.320
I apologize to all my regular listeners,
all 14 of you.

777
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:27.090
Um,
you know,
it sucks.

778
00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:29.590
I got a bunch of friend requests and I thought I was finally going to be able to

779
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:34.210
get up past fucking 28,000 and I added everybody.

780
00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:38.860
I was 28,992 I wanted to get the 29,000.

781
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.510
God Damn,
man,

782
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:44.470
I swear to God there's a fucking conspiracy here and you know what it is.

783
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:47.470
It's the fucking Rothschild family and there were all over Facebook.

784
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.130
And I'm telling you that's the scam.
That's the new scam.

785
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:55.660
And it's time few people to fucking wake up and realize that's your social

786
00:47:55.661 --> 00:48:00.070
networking,
Internet rights and freedoms of being taken away from you.

787
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.510
I'm Joe Biden.
You know,
I don't even know who Joe Biden is.

788
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:07.750
I've just been hearing his name in the background.
Kind of like,

789
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.930
he's like the Jonas brothers and my cultural world.

790
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.980
Like every time I walk by a magazine,
it's either his face or the Jonas brothers.

791
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:20.460
And I don't know either one of their material at the Jonas brothers started,

792
00:48:20.471 --> 00:48:22.690
started singing a speech of Joe Biden.

793
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.800
And you told me that that was a number one hit and teenage girls loved it.

794
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:30.620
I'd have to agree with you.
Those Jonas brothers,

795
00:48:30.621 --> 00:48:34.720
it really wear tight clothes,
don't they?
And is that why the hair is so curly?

796
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:36.470
Thank you.
Alright,

797
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.930
here's one for you as a little monologue joke for you.
They really do.

798
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:42.190
They just look really chunky,

799
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.680
like they're going to be fat fucks when they get older.
You know what I mean?

800
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:47.560
Which be hilarious.
Not like they going to be obese,

801
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:49.840
but they're going to have that fat middle aged face.

802
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.560
And that's the big thing that nobody talks about when you get middle age like me

803
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:57.700
is trying not to have a fat porky pig face.

804
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.880
It's the weirdest thing.
Even if you're in shape,

805
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:03.700
you still get that fucking swollen head.

806
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.470
The cheeks she get the Winston Churchill face,
you know,

807
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:13.540
jolly,
you get the jolly rosy cheeks.
You know what it is?

808
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:16.870
It's the booze man.
It's the fucking booze,

809
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:21.400
which I have laid off for a,
the above two and a half weeks.

810
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.200
I've had a beer and a half at a half a beer at a,

811
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:30.940
uh,
the uninformed taping that I did with Joe to Rosa,
my XM radio show.

812
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.270
I had half a beer at that.
And let me tell you something.

813
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.510
You stopped drinking beer for two weeks and you drink,
you take a sip of a beer.

814
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.180
Uh,
it's one of the greatest things you've ever tasted in your life.

815
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.381
It's delicious.

816
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:45.550
Like you ever watch Shawshank redemption and not Tim Robbins when he's sitting

817
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:48.000
on the roof and he gives that,

818
00:49:48.001 --> 00:49:53.001
that Cunty fucking gorilla maniac guard tax advice and all he wants is some suds

819
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:59.320
as he talks about.
He talks about just the way he described sitting on that roof.

820
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.980
I guess it's Morgan Freeman's character describes drinking that beer that always

821
00:50:02.981 --> 00:50:06.490
makes me want to drink a fucking beer.
You know,
just drink a 12 pack.

822
00:50:06.491 --> 00:50:09.940
There was a fucking fly in my apartment that he doesn't realize it,

823
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:14.710
but his life is ending today.
You know what I mean?
I hate being like that,

824
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:18.220
you know?
I know it's just the fucking insect and shit and you know,

825
00:50:18.221 --> 00:50:21.070
you killed this and then all of a sudden the bees start dropping off.

826
00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:25.690
But he sees fucking obnoxious.
You know,
when you have a house,

827
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:29.900
fly in and spending your house for a couple of days,
you know,
he started,

828
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.810
he knows he's kind of like an athlete and the twilight twilight of his career.

829
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.360
It's like Brett Farve and the jets,
you know,

830
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.810
successfully that mother fucker sitting right there.
I'm just trying to kill.

831
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:42.830
This is the first time I ever tried to kill a sly right on my podcast and see on

832
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.420
the inside.
This is a big thing.
You don't know if it's,

833
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:47.790
is it on the inside or the outside?
All right.
One,
two,
three.

834
00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.173
<v 4>Okay,</v>

835
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:59.240
<v 7>motherfucker.
I got you.
Bam.
Right between the blinds.
There you go.</v>

836
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:05.200
So someday when he insects over this podcast as this is what's going to take me

837
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:11.600
down,
then I'll try to be like,
no,
that wasn't me.
That was somebody else.

838
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.540
I sold my act to my brother just like that Guy Gallagher.

839
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:19.240
I sold the podcast to him.
Bill Burr,
part two when he was doing it.
Oh,

840
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.260
that was fucking satisfying.
All right.
It'll be hilarious to,

841
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:27.500
somebody actually sent me a complaint cause somebody send me an email

842
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:31.970
complaining about the fact that I just murdered an insect mocking those fucking

843
00:51:31.971 --> 00:51:35.870
Peter Maniacs.
You know what I'm saying?
And I love animals too,

844
00:51:35.871 --> 00:51:40.610
but I just hate groups.
I hate groups of people because in order to get noticed,

845
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.420
they just make a lot of noise and they never come up with a good chance.

846
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:46.250
And it's just,
I don't know,

847
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:50.120
it's just fucking annoying to knowing and they gotta do they gotta try to be

848
00:51:50.121 --> 00:51:53.180
shocking,
you know,
like,
you know,
it really sucks.

849
00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.210
And there's those commercials that they make about cigarettes.

850
00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.110
Have you seen that?
They always do some public demonstration.

851
00:52:00.111 --> 00:52:02.210
I don't know what the fuck the name of those commercials are,

852
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:06.410
but they're so fucking annoying that he,
they just,
uh,

853
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:10.130
they make me want to smoke.
Just,

854
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.910
I wouldn't smoke,
but you know what I mean?
I can't even explain it.

855
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:14.750
It's just like,
you know,

856
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.450
they make me want to do something and I don't even want to fucking do
all right.

857
00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.780
Whatever.
You guys get the point.
All right.
Whatever.
It's early.
It's me.

858
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:27.200
Just send me a text message.
Joe,
nick comedian out of,
uh,

859
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:31.370
San Francisco via fucking,
uh,
Pittsburgh said,

860
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.570
uh,
we went to the other Ucla Bruin game last night.

861
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.750
That's another reason why I didn't do the podcast cause I got off the plane.

862
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:44.840
I got off the plane over there Mang and a teacher,
you get to Yale.
And I,

863
00:52:44.841 --> 00:52:48.190
uh,
went right over to the rose bowl and I went to Ucla,
Tennessee,

864
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:51.050
Tennessee game fucking unbelievable game.

865
00:52:51.051 --> 00:52:54.470
Went into overtime and a UCLA one it,

866
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:59.300
and I think I have a team out here.
I was,
I got so fucking into that game.

867
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:02.030
I'm tie something.
If you guys,
if you're into pro sports,

868
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:06.680
take a second look at college football and all everybody's psyched about the NFL

869
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:11.390
dude.
It's fucking bananas.
It's,
it's unbelievable.
Can I just say bananas?

870
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:16.280
What do said,
I just really hate myself sometimes it's spoken bananas.
It's wacky.

871
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.020
Said bananas and you know,
and I,
you know,

872
00:53:21.021 --> 00:53:24.860
I just made myself sound like I go to games with one of those raccoon coats from

873
00:53:24.861 --> 00:53:29.820
the 1920s.
Rah Rah Sis,
boom by.
Um,
but now it's insane.
You know,

874
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:33.420
you got like,
the band's going crazy.
The students are going crazy.

875
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.460
They got all those chants and stuff.

876
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:40.040
It's the closest thing America has to like a,
you have a like watch those,
those,

877
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:41.481
some of the,

878
00:53:41.481 --> 00:53:45.480
the soccer or football as they call it over in England where people are just

879
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:50.040
going bananas.
Uh,
I said bananas again.
Jay's is quite,
if I say it one more time,

880
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:53.880
I'm going to have to hang up on myself.
When the fuck did I start saying bananas?

881
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.860
You know what that's on my friends and everyone around me in my life,

882
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:00.870
but not saying,
dude,
why the fuck do you say that?

883
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:02.250
You really need to stop saying that.

884
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.130
It's like some of my relatives in Boston and who say Pissa you see that game

885
00:54:08.131 --> 00:54:08.964
dude?
Yeah,
dude,

886
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:13.590
it was Pissa like fucking in their 40 still saying that.
It's just,

887
00:54:13.591 --> 00:54:17.670
it makes me fucking skin crawl.
But then I'm saying bananas.
All right.

888
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:19.650
But anyways,
I'm in college football.
I'm actually,

889
00:54:19.651 --> 00:54:21.180
I'm doing a gig coming up in Austin,

890
00:54:21.181 --> 00:54:25.470
Texas and I'm going to a Texas longhorn Missouri game.
I'm going to be there.

891
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.290
So if you're one of the hundred thousand fucking maniacs,

892
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.700
who was there going nuts rather than bananas?

893
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:37.230
What's a good way to say bananas?
There's my podcast question for you.

894
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.770
All right.
And speaking of podcast questions,
there's a segue for you.

895
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.330
Um,
we're going to get into the podcast questions,
but first,

896
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:50.350
a moment from our sponsor.
Last week I talked about a state capitols.

897
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.980
Did you miss that episode?
Well,

898
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:55.890
maybe she listened to that half hour babbling and,
uh,

899
00:54:55.891 --> 00:55:00.120
I was kind of asking the question is,
why the fuck is it always the second rate?

900
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:03.750
City always seems to be the capitol.
You know what I mean?

901
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.490
Like it's never,
uh,
you know,
New York,
it's not New York City.

902
00:55:08.491 --> 00:55:12.120
That's what you'd think it would be.
But it's Albany.
Okay.
It's,

903
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:16.020
you go to Illinois,
it's not Chicago,
it's Springfield.
You go to Pennsylvania,

904
00:55:16.021 --> 00:55:18.750
it's not Philly of Pittsburgh,
it's Harrisburg.
It's always something like,

905
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.030
what the fuck?
You know?
And I thought it was,

906
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:23.730
cause people initially thought that that was the town that was going to be the

907
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:28.530
shit.
And uh,
then it stopped being the shit in another town.
It became the shit,

908
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.410
but they already made it be the capitol and they were too embarrassed to say

909
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:33.810
that they made a mistake.
You know what I mean?

910
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.380
It's kind of like the people like the Jonas brothers right now,
you know,

911
00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:42.570
the Jonas brothers are the,
uh,
musical equivalent to the city of Albany.

912
00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:48.090
That's what I'm trying,
that's what I'm trying to say there.
Um,

913
00:55:48.091 --> 00:55:49.770
so anyways,
this guy tries to claim,

914
00:55:49.771 --> 00:55:53.760
he says on the topic of why cities like Harrisburg and almonds,
Albany,

915
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:57.030
our state capitols over Philly or New York City.

916
00:55:57.330 --> 00:56:00.930
The reason is because most state capitols are located geographically in the

917
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:03.960
center of the state.
That way local government,

918
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:08.250
government officials wouldn't have to travel across the whole state to get to

919
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:09.084
the capital.

920
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:14.340
There are a few exceptions like Carson city and Tallahassee,
but overall,

921
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:18.480
that's the general reason why shit's cities,
our capitals.

922
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.630
Is that true?
Wait a minute.
Boston,

923
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.290
that's not in the middle of this state is provenance.
Provenance Kinda is.

924
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:31.450
I don't know.
Is that true?
I actually got in one argument that guy the other day,

925
00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:35.560
Pete Dominick comedian,
and he goes,
cite your sources.
You need three sources,

926
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:36.520
just like journalism.

927
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.730
And I realized that not only do I don't not have three sources,

928
00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.500
I usually don't even have one.
I just have my gut going in,

929
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.760
it sounds like fucking bullshit.
And then I just spend it.

930
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.130
So I found like I know what I'm talking about.

931
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:51.340
So can anybody back up with that guy saying,
is that the real reason for that?

932
00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.520
Huh?
Anybody?
Um,
all right,
that's it.
Let's get into the questions for this week.

933
00:56:57.521 --> 00:57:01.360
The podcast questions.
Question number one.
Hey Bill,

934
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:04.670
I have a question for your podcasts.
Um,
if you were locked in,

935
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:08.260
this is a great question.
By the way.
This is one of the greatest questions I've,

936
00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:09.370
I've ever gotten.
Okay.

937
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:13.990
This guy is setting the fucking bar for podcast questions.

938
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.380
All right,
here is the questions.
Here's a question.
Sorry.

939
00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:23.130
If you were locked in a gymnasium full of hundreds of unarmed,

940
00:57:23.171 --> 00:57:26.020
six year olds of various weight,

941
00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:31.590
height races and temperaments and all you had were the clothes on your back,

942
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.600
how many of them do you think you could kill before they overpowered you?

943
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.350
What a fucking great question.
All right,

944
00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:45.280
so obviously I'm setting all morals aside here.

945
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:51.510
If you set aside all morals and all feelings of guilt and a,

946
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:55.960
or maybe I just felt like I was right,
like these were evil kids.

947
00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.490
I'm trying to think of a reason why a gymnasium full of six year olds of various

948
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:02.590
weights,
Heisen races and temperaments,

949
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:08.590
how many do I think I could fucking kill before they overpowered me?
Uh,

950
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:12.250
let's see here.
The average is six year old has got to be about,

951
00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.170
are they four feet,
four feet tall?

952
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:18.700
Like fucking Tim Duncan was probably four feet tall when he was six.

953
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:21.350
And there are any future NBA players in this.
If they're not,

954
00:58:21.351 --> 00:58:24.190
if they're just going to be like accountants and fucking,
you know,

955
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:26.920
occasional wife beater,
that'd be the tough one.
I think,

956
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:30.040
you know what I'd have to do,
do they know I'm going to overpower me?

957
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.540
I'm just going to have to assume like if they know that I'm coming in there as

958
00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:39.400
the killer of six year olds.
So they all banded together to try to slay me.

959
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:45.070
I mean,
I think the first thing I'd have to do,
not just not to hack off of,
uh,

960
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:48.310
ESPN analysts here and use one of their expressions,

961
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:49.360
but I'm going to have to here.

962
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:53.920
I think the first thing I'd have to do is I'd have to set the tone and a by

963
00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:54.790
setting the tone,

964
00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:59.791
I mean I just have to do something so fucked up to the first wave of Braveheart,

965
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:04.390
six year olds coming at me that I would have that give those steps.

966
00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:08.500
Second way that split second of thinking about what the fuck they were doing.

967
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:13.300
Right.
And uh,
I'm talking about leg sweeps,

968
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:18.840
the kind that would,
that would blow out an adult ACL.
Okay.
Which w I'm talking,

969
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:23.120
yeah,
I'm wearing timberlands and I'm going to fucking,

970
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.570
I get one of them with one of those,
you know,
you remember that move?

971
00:59:26.571 --> 00:59:27.560
What's his face used to do?

972
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:30.830
Andre the giant when they throw a dude off the ropes and he just stick his foot

973
00:59:30.831 --> 00:59:31.664
up.

974
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.510
I don't know man.
I don't know.
Fuck.
I don't know how many I could get,

975
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:39.650
how many I could kill.

976
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.420
I'd have to fuck them up first and leave them dazed and then I'd have to go back

977
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:48.470
to finishing them off.
But uh,
if I just had to use my fist man,
I mean,
you know,

978
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:52.640
even though the six year old that's still a skull,
it's going to hurt.
Wow.

979
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:54.440
I'm getting really creepy with this on.
Okay.

980
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:56.810
I would say I could probably fuck up.

981
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:03.260
I could kill about 11.
I could kill 11 but you know,
I,
you know what,

982
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:07.310
you know,
I think that I could,
oh,
kill a number that low is because number one,

983
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:10.760
someone to discovery channel.
I saw this wasp entered this,

984
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:12.770
this beehive of these honeybees,

985
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.910
and like the wasps scene or whatever the fuck it was can destroy the honeybees.

986
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.870
They can kill like a hundred to one.
They can destroy these fuckers.

987
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.550
So what happened was he went in there,
he was doing surveillance for his,

988
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:29.000
his wasp or his horn at nest and then all he's going to go back and get his boys

989
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.630
and they were all going to come back or you send it on a signal for them to
come.

990
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.610
So what he didn't realize was the honeybee som and they started like wiggling

991
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:41.540
their acids as a signal.
And what happened was,
is that the exact fucking moment,

992
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:46.100
all the honeybees jumped on the fucking wasp or the horn at the same time.

993
01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:49.280
And they want top of them.
And they started like basically dry humping him.

994
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.830
But what they really were doing,
and they will vibrating.

995
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.760
And I guess a Hornet can only survive in temperatures up to 116 degrees.

996
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:04.460
We're a honeybee can go up to 118 degrees.
So these mother fuckers,

997
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:09.740
they vibrated to the point where the temperature was 118 degrees,

998
01:01:09.741 --> 01:01:14.060
one degree,
fucking more la,
117 degrees,

999
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.750
one degree more than the Horner could,
could fucking survive.

1000
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.500
And one degree less than what would fucking kill them.
It was,

1001
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:23.300
it was one of the greatest attacks,
the mercy of life.

1002
01:01:23.301 --> 01:01:25.840
And they basically cook the fucker.
And that was the end of him.

1003
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:30.880
So get those six year olds knew I was coming and they all jumped on me and

1004
01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:35.630
started fucking vibrating being a redhead.
I mean,
once they got over 80 degrees,

1005
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:39.260
I would be fucked.
I'd be passed out and that would be the end of it.

1006
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:43.460
All they'd have to do is drag my unconscious carcass out to the sun and then

1007
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:47.840
that would be it.
That would be a death by third degrees.
Sunburns.

1008
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.110
All right,
Jesus.
I'm like out of breath from answering that one.
Okay.
Um,

1009
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.520
now we're getting onto overrated,
underrated.
Then I got to get on with my,
uh,

1010
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.130
with my day here as to you.
Who's kidding?
Who,

1011
01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.070
why am I acting like I'm the only busy one?
All right.

1012
01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:03.380
For those of you new to my podcast last couple of weeks,

1013
01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:05.860
people have been sending me in,
uh,

1014
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.370
their list of stuff that they think is overrated and underrated.

1015
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.110
I'll say as a new Ucla Bruin Fan,
you know what I find fucking overrated.

1016
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:18.350
The fucking Tennessee volunteers.
What do you think about that?

1017
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.200
Ranked against Ucla where they rank 44th,

1018
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.520
the third string quarterback when a checklist height gain the guy to for

1019
01:02:26.521 --> 01:02:28.590
pickoffs,
one for a touchdown in the first half.

1020
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:33.780
And then he came out in the second half,
like fucking Joe Montana,
Kurt Warner,

1021
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.680
and maybe even Fran Tarkington.
Um,
all right.

1022
01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.780
You don't actually is overrated is underrated,
is a man's ability to shower,

1023
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:46.230
shave,
and be ready and in the fucking car within 15 minutes.

1024
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.710
I experienced that this weekend when Finney brand,

1025
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.190
the beloved owner of the Stress Factory in New Jersey took me out on his boat.

1026
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:55.680
Okay.
And we came back,

1027
01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:58.500
the show was in an hour and there was some sort of boat house and he's like,

1028
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:02.890
he talks like fucking,
you know,
a muppet.
He's like,
oh,
I got it on there.
I got,
Oh,

1029
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:05.590
I've got to take a shower.
Just hang on a second.

1030
01:03:05.591 --> 01:03:09.480
And he leaves me in the car with his awful fucking Bruce Springsteen CD cause

1031
01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:14.130
everybody in New Jersey loves Bruce Springsteen.
So,
uh,

1032
01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:16.050
he goes in and I'm thinking it's going to be a fuck.

1033
01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:19.770
He's going to be in it for 25 fucking minutes.
Let's do it in and out.
Came out,

1034
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:24.120
you know,
he looked like smelled of man soap and he was fucking ready to go.

1035
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:27.090
He actually make,
made me feel unclean within 10 minutes.

1036
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.220
It's an incredible thing.
So that's my overrated,
underrated for the week.
Okay.

1037
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:36.000
Here's everybody else's.
Alright.
Overrated Stella bear.

1038
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:41.100
It tastes just like Budweiser and every non tasting having schlepped insist it's

1039
01:03:41.101 --> 01:03:44.730
a quality beer.
I guess nobody's heard of Lam.

1040
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.230
Lango needas or dog fish head.
You know what?

1041
01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:53.790
I've never heard of those either and I can't,
I can't pass judgment on those.

1042
01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:57.780
But those sounds like those kinds of beers that I see when I go to Colorado and

1043
01:03:57.781 --> 01:04:02.340
there's those,
those rafting Hippie,
I'm into.
Dave Matthews,

1044
01:04:02.341 --> 01:04:05.460
Bergen stock,
hackey sack fuckers drinking,
that kind of shit.

1045
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.910
You know when you go down there and they have those,
those fucking micro brews.

1046
01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:13.080
I think microbrews overrated,
but the best one I did,

1047
01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:16.260
I went to was the one I told you Dan on Nantucket.
Cisco Breweries.
Man,

1048
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:20.430
God damn and I'm still waiting for my vodka by the way.
You sons of bitches.

1049
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:23.040
I understand your mom and pop.
What the fuck?

1050
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.270
I got three bottles at AAA coming my way and I have since quit drinking.

1051
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.520
Maybe they listened to the podcast.
All right.

1052
01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:34.350
Overrated hyped up bachelor parties.
Oh,
isn't that the truth?

1053
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.060
You always think it's going to be like a fucking movie.

1054
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:39.930
This guy says if you have to wear a tee shirt that says something like stick a

1055
01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:44.100
fork in them,
it's almost guaranteed that it's going to be a queer fest

1056
01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.950
especially.
There's definitely going to be at least one dip.
Shit.

1057
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.440
That is way too into taking pictures.

1058
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.060
I know how gay is that guys can't take textures.
That's fucking gay.

1059
01:04:56.090 --> 01:05:00.180
[inaudible] some gay about me.
I'm actually in the flowers to a like,

1060
01:05:00.181 --> 01:05:01.230
it's so gay.

1061
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.790
It goes beyond gay and comes back into a heterosexual,

1062
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:11.580
I think.
No it doesn't.
Maybe it comes to a sort of gay,

1063
01:05:11.581 --> 01:05:14.850
heterosexual,
I don't know.
I like flowers.
I realized that about myself,

1064
01:05:14.851 --> 01:05:17.920
about a couple of faces and every week I'd come off the road.

1065
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.750
I was actually arranging them today like measuring the stems and looking at the

1066
01:05:22.751 --> 01:05:25.870
colors to try and set them up.
I've got like these days he's right.

1067
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:30.790
I got one is yellow ones like this sort of like a,
you have a see a fender strat.

1068
01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:33.520
When they got that sunburst finish,
that's what it looks like.

1069
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.910
Then I got like these three lavender one,
so put the lavender ones in the back.

1070
01:05:36.911 --> 01:05:39.420
They'd like to backup singers.
You know what I mean?
You don't like those,

1071
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:42.670
those big black chicks they always have behind the skinny white girl who can't

1072
01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:47.170
fucking sing.
You know?
That's how I arrange them.

1073
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.620
I put the Pale ones up front.
It's like Paul Simon as what it is.

1074
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:54.040
It's like Paul Simon on the rhythm of the saints tour.
That's how I arrange a,

1075
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:58.960
and I don't know.
I look at them,
they make me feel good
and you know,

1076
01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:03.400
I'm comfortable enough with myself to be able to admit that.
All right.

1077
01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:04.650
Another overrated thing.

1078
01:06:04.651 --> 01:06:09.651
Somebody said Notre Dame and he said I can go on forever forever about this one.

1079
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.240
But the amount of assets that a blue chip or gives up not playing in places like

1080
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:16.361
South Beach,

1081
01:06:16.361 --> 01:06:20.950
Miami or southern California cause he just had to wait cause he just had to wear

1082
01:06:20.951 --> 01:06:25.030
the gold helmet sickens me.
Oh isn't that truth?

1083
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:27.940
That's the truth.
Yeah.
But if you play for the University of Miami,
man,

1084
01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:31.480
that's a fucking dangerous place.
That's a God damn dangerous placement.

1085
01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:34.500
You guys have fatalities on the regular,
on your teeth.

1086
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.600
And I just say on the regular,
whether they rent fucking Fridays last night,

1087
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.030
how do I start off saying bananas and then I go with on the,
on the regular,
um,

1088
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.760
you know something,
I always wanted to go to university of Miami game,

1089
01:06:45.761 --> 01:06:47.680
but I wanted to go when they played in the orange bowl.

1090
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:52.120
Now they play in the Joe Robbie.
It just doesn't seem right.
You know what I mean?

1091
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.550
Um,
okay.
Another thing,
overrated Asian Pussy.

1092
01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:03.850
I'm not sure what I was expecting,
but I'll be honest,
I was expecting more.
Uh,

1093
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:04.061
well,

1094
01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:07.690
did you ever think that maybe the Asian you hooked up with wasn't good in bed?

1095
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.720
I mean,
you're going to judge an entire continent.

1096
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:16.300
You know what's funny is when people say Asian immediately,
myself included,

1097
01:07:16.350 --> 01:07:21.040
as doesn't everybody think,
you know,
Chinese,
Japanese,
Korean,
Vietnamese,
anybody,

1098
01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:24.160
you know,
with the,
uh,
quote unquote,
uh,
Asian eyes,

1099
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:29.510
one of the politically correct way of saying what the fucking Spanish basketball

1100
01:07:29.771 --> 01:07:32.920
team was trying to do.
But that also could be mean.

1101
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:37.060
You hooked up from somebody from India and they stunk in bed.

1102
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.050
You know what I mean?
I think you should,
uh,
listen,
there's fucking hotties.

1103
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.340
Well,
you know what,
this,
this deserves a followup question.

1104
01:07:45.341 --> 01:07:49.750
How many Asians did you hook up with before you decided to do an entire

1105
01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:52.290
continent of pussy?
I mean,
that,

1106
01:07:52.291 --> 01:07:55.300
that's pretty amazing when it's one of the biggest continence out there,

1107
01:07:55.301 --> 01:07:59.200
if not the biggest is it?
I have no fucking,
it was Africa.
Bigger Africa's bigger,

1108
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:02.830
but I gotta tell you some age is on the rise too.
So,
you know,

1109
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:06.670
be watch what you say.
Okay?
You saw what China did in the Olympics.

1110
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:10.900
They can do that on the rings.
Just think what they can do in the a fucking,

1111
01:08:10.901 --> 01:08:15.680
I dunno.
Computer industry.
All right,
let's get to,
uh,
let's get the underrated,

1112
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:20.090
underrated.
This guy says,
uh,
early nineties gangster rap videos,

1113
01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.970
hands down the greatest videos ever made.

1114
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:27.110
Just a bunch of black dudes hanging out in Compton with their baseball caps

1115
01:08:27.111 --> 01:08:30.830
blurred out.
I miss those days.
Uh,
I gotta agree with you,
man.

1116
01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:32.490
Those we'll fucking great days from that time.

1117
01:08:32.491 --> 01:08:35.390
They was that really pretty girl at the party and they don't shake up their

1118
01:08:35.391 --> 01:08:38.660
forties and they dump it on her head because she,
you know,

1119
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:42.230
she thought she was the shit.
You know what the reality is?

1120
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.500
Is they were looking at her thinking that she thought that she was the shit for

1121
01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:50.960
all,
you know,
she was fucking,
she was probably insecure,

1122
01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.200
like a lot of beautiful women are.
He always got some sort of hangup.
Oh my God.

1123
01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:55.880
I hate my ankles,
you know,

1124
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:58.640
so she was probably thinking that cause she wasn't wearing jeans,

1125
01:08:58.641 --> 01:09:01.640
she's wearing a little hoary outfit.
So she's actually in our head,

1126
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.480
which caused her have a shutdown look on her face.
So then snoop it or whoever,

1127
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:09.560
Dre or Warren g or whatever the fuck it was out there in Cali.

1128
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.770
They also look at his bitch.
She,
she's all fucking stuck up.

1129
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:16.400
And then they shook up their forties and they dumped it over fucking head.

1130
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.020
And she probably ran home crying thinking that they did it because they didn't

1131
01:09:21.021 --> 01:09:24.710
like our ankles.
And you know what,
that probably led to her being a stripper.

1132
01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:29.060
That's how it happens.
All right.
Uh,
underrated.
Ricky Gervais'.

1133
01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:34.070
Sky's made two great TV shows and less than five years,

1134
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:36.380
less than five years of each other.

1135
01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:38.510
And he still doesn't get the Kudos he deserves.

1136
01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.780
Maybe it's because there's no laugh track.
Who knows?
I gotta say something.

1137
01:09:41.781 --> 01:09:43.400
Ricky Gervais' is a fucking genius.

1138
01:09:43.401 --> 01:09:46.580
And if you never saw the original version of the office,

1139
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:50.930
no offense to the American version,
it's unbelievable.
He's that guy.

1140
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.800
That guy is a genius.
That one.
I can't remember the,
what the episode was about,

1141
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:59.801
but that one where he plays the guitar in the middle of the meeting is the most

1142
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:04.370
uncomfortable,
hilarious fucking thing I've ever seen.
And that guy,

1143
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.580
I like how he has a drinking problem and how being an alcoholic is still funny

1144
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:13.880
in England,
you can make fun of people having drinking problems over here.

1145
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:18.770
It's only going to have an intervention.
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1146
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:24.020
Um,
all right,
we're winding down here.
I the movie base,
Get Ball,

1147
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:29.660
David Zucker and the south park guys together,
a very underappreciated movie.

1148
01:10:29.661 --> 01:10:32.450
You know what?
I got to rent that because when I looked at the trailer,
I'm like,

1149
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:33.680
that looks fucking stupid.

1150
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:38.060
And then a comedian that I respected sought and told me it was hilarious and it

1151
01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:42.920
was a good movie.
And,
uh,
I'm going to rent that.
I'm gonna to rent that fucker.
Uh,

1152
01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.210
speaking of which,
I finally saw Miller's crossing and the end,

1153
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:51.740
and I got to admit,
uh,
John to Turo is fucking unreal.

1154
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:56.210
And that movie got,
damn it.
That was a good fucking movie.
Um.
All right.

1155
01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:56.661
Last thing.

1156
01:10:56.661 --> 01:11:00.800
Last thing for this week's underrated list is rage against the machine.

1157
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:06.020
This guy says,
in my opinion,
the best band in the past 20 years.
Wow.

1158
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.840
And for all the shit that's going on in the world now,

1159
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:10.910
there music was way before its time.

1160
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.590
That original album is genius from to finish.

1161
01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:17.640
My only complaint was when I saw them at Randall's island last year.

1162
01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:23.180
It was rage against the machine brought to you by rockstar energy drink.

1163
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.720
That upset me as well.
It should as well it should.
But you know something.

1164
01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:29.100
That's what happens after awhile.

1165
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.490
After awhile you get into middle age and you like,
you know what?

1166
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:36.600
At some point I'd like to sleep on a bed.
I'd like to have a fucking couch.

1167
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:40.230
And you know what?
I drink rockstar energy drink.
It tastes good to me.

1168
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:44.580
So if they want to fucking finance the God damn for what do I care?

1169
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:45.391
I mean,

1170
01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:50.340
do they have eight year olds putting rock star drink into fucking coke cans over

1171
01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:54.180
in Thailand?
Because if that's the case,
I want support it.
Okay.

1172
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.220
But if it's somebody used to build fucking,

1173
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.040
I don't know where the fuck I'm going with this.
Anyways,

1174
01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:02.910
I want to thank everybody for listening to my podcast and like I said,

1175
01:12:02.911 --> 01:12:05.190
if you knew what it might page,
which I keep saying because I,
well,

1176
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:08.790
I'm hoping I have some new people with the new special out.
Um,

1177
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.530
I do one of these every week to give you a laugh.

1178
01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:14.100
At the beginning of the week I answer questions people send in their underrated

1179
01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:16.410
overrated lifts.

1180
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.400
I'm trying to get an a new list going because I'm starting to think that that

1181
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:24.810
one is,
uh,
I think we've,
I think we've pretty much handled it at this point.

1182
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.220
Um,
keeps sending those in.
But if anybody wants to start a new list,
please,

1183
01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:33.870
by all means,
because,
uh,
I do not have creative control of the podcast.

1184
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:35.430
If you want to switch the direction of it,

1185
01:12:35.431 --> 01:12:37.890
just send me a funny fucking email that spins the off.

1186
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:41.310
I'll babble about something else.
Maybe somebody else will add to it.

1187
01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:44.910
And that's how it happens.
Huh?
Isn't that interesting?
All right.

1188
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.030
So this week coming up,
I'm going to be a,

1189
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:51.900
I'm actually doing a college gig at a with Charlie Murphy and,
uh,

1190
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:55.500
Umass Amhurst in Boston.
Now it's a private show.

1191
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:59.940
So that's only for students unless you somehow wink,
wink,

1192
01:12:59.941 --> 01:13:02.670
figure out a way to sneak in,
which you didn't hear here,

1193
01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.030
which of course you did because now it's a podcast.
I don't advocate doing that.

1194
01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.140
I don't advocate putting on a baseball hat and looking like you are of college

1195
01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:13.860
age and trying to just sort of walk a walk in with the rest of the students.

1196
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:18.690
I do not advocate doing that.
Okay.
Don't do that.

1197
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.490
That would really make me upset.
All right there.
I'm in the clear now.
Um,

1198
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.160
and the following weeks,
September 11th through the 1,130,
I think the 13th,

1199
01:13:29.161 --> 01:13:33.300
I'm going to be at the punchline in San Francisco and the weekend after that,

1200
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:35.910
uh,
what's 11 and seven 11 and 17,

1201
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:40.940
18 1920 and 21 I will be at the funny bone in,

1202
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.620
uh,
Richmond,
Virginia.

1203
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:49.330
I'll be visiting my buddy sludge out there on the radio and uh,

1204
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:51.120
I'll be performing right down there at the mall,

1205
01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:54.300
right across some Dick's sporting goods.
How you liked that,

1206
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:57.810
right back down to earth.
One hour special.

1207
01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:02.870
I'm on top of the world two weeks later unperforming across some addicts in

1208
01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:07.530
Richmond.
Virginia is a fucking reality slap for you.
Um,

1209
01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.120
and that is it.
And the new DVD,

1210
01:14:09.121 --> 01:14:13.800
we'll be out of this special on September and I will be selling that fucker at

1211
01:14:13.801 --> 01:14:16.930
all my shows and I'll be autographing autographing it.

1212
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:20.440
And if you buy it and you just want to come to one of my shows and bring it up

1213
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:23.500
to me and you want me to sign it,
I'll sign the fucker.
Cause uh,

1214
01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:25.600
I appreciate you buying it and that is it.

1215
01:14:25.601 --> 01:14:29.490
And for those of you who want to know what the extras are on it really quick,
uh,

1216
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:32.500
I have the Philadelphia rant is one of the extras,

1217
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.060
the classic cell phone footage from the show in Camden,

1218
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.440
New Jersey,
where I got booed in front of those people.

1219
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:43.720
Everybody knows what it is.
So that I got that on there.

1220
01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:48.520
I got the uninformed one where I had my radio show where me and Joe got in a

1221
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:53.080
huge argument.
And then we ended up,
we tried to settle it with a drum battle.
And,

1222
01:14:53.081 --> 01:14:56.380
uh,
then I got some of the footage of me just going around to the New York clubs,

1223
01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.620
talking about different horrific sets that I've had over the years,

1224
01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:03.330
just telling the story.
So ton of extras and all that bullshit.

1225
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.680
And now I'm done babbling.
Thank you so much for listening.
Uh,

1226
01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.940
you guys all have a good weekend next week.
I actually will do it on Monday.

1227
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:11.000
On Monday,

1228
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.190
<v 4>morning podcast.
There you go.
Everybody has a good,</v>

1229
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:27.560
so [inaudible] [inaudible].
