00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.210
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill bird.

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.460
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:10.070
May 2nd,
2016
and I know,

4
00:00:10.071 --> 00:00:13.340
I always make that joke like,
oh my God,
where is it here going.

5
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:16.730
But seriously guys,
seriously,
where the fuck is this year going?

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.970
What the fuck?
May 2nd already may fucking second.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.920
But getting ready for this,
um,
in the meg,

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.140
I'm psyched.
I'm psyched that we're into May.

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.640
Cause may means we're closer to the middle of July and in the middle of the Jill

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.950
of July I will be done writing,
you know,

11
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:41.510

And then I'm,
I'm free.

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.030
Not really,
but sort of,
and I'll have two weeks off and then all freckles.

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.950
Rumor has it is going to be doing a,
doing a nice run through Europe.
So,

14
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:56.450
uh,
which might may or may not start in Ireland.

15
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.840
It's all a sort of loose at this point.
But uh,

16
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.320
we're slugging it out and um,
I'm actually feeling much better by the way.

17
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:09.460
Thank you for not asking with my Sayada.

18
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.160
Cyanic and it sounds like a fucking speed metal band,
you know,

19
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.990
not a good one though.
Right?

20
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.740
<v 2>Come see my band cy Attica.</v>

21
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.990
We're going to be down at the ground round on a Wednesday night.

22
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.260
Okay.

23
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.110

hey,

24
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:32.330

25
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:32.780

26
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.490
<v 1>dude,

I'll get there.
All right bro.</v>

27
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.810
Chill.
Um,
Sciatica.
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.510
I actually,
I got some,
I found some new stretches.
I found this fucking guy on a,

29
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:50.930
on youtube does doctor who's just sitting on a yoga mat,

30
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.810
one of these fucking new agey guys,
you know what I mean?

31
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.750
One of those guys that's like straight,
but we're still makes you uncomfortable.

32
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.570
You know those,
you know those straight guys?
Like it's straight up.

33
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:04.700
Gay Guy is not uncomfortable to be around,

34
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.480
but there's a certain kind of straight guy that's coming off like he's gay,

35
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.960
but he's straight.
That is the most uncomfortable male to be around.

36
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.540
I don't know why.
You know what I mean?

37
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.020
It's almost like they got something between their teeth and you just can't even

38
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:19.640
hear what the fuck they say.
Do you want to be like,

39
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.660
can you just go and get that the fuck outta here so I can listen to you?

40
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.970
Is there a word for that?
The Gay Straight Guy?

41
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.150
Um,
yeah,
Bill,
it's called a gay guy in Cla.
In,
in the,
in the closet.
Well,

42
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:38.440
maybe it isn't some,
some guys are just,
uh,
some guys who just a feminine,

43
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.200
some guys just stand there and gym class classes.
One person after another.

44
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.790
<v 1>This call to be on the team.
I,
it's a stereotype,
right?
This gay athletes,</v>

46
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.460
it was that guy who played on a,

47
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.880
the big 12 there in Missouri and then he went to a,

48
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.330
that football team and then he got cut.
It must have been hard to cut him.
Right.

49
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.240
All right.
How bad is this guy?

50
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:04.440
You have to suck before we won't get accused of being homophobic when we kind
of,

51
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.460
you know,
that's always in the air,
but that's not what I wanted to talk about.

52
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.510
I'm here to talk about siren at the Worcester set drum.

53
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.633
Um,

54
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.050
turns out my hamstring was fucked up so I was doing like the touch at toe

55
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:19.591
stretches,

56
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:23.900
which is the exact opposite thing that you want to do because the nerve is

57
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.840
pinched or inflamed and you're just like,
you're,
you're,

58
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.720
you're not stretching it out.
What it,
I guess you stretch the muscles really.

59
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.110
So whatever I usually yet,
I don't know,
stretches around the nerve.

60
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.401
I have no idea.

61
00:03:35.401 --> 00:03:39.960
I never even heard of this fucking thing until I had this problem and God knows

62
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:43.340
I didn't take any anatomy classes.
So,
um,

63
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.280
I think when you don't have a nerve issue,
you can then do that Ben.
Cause what,

64
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:49.260
what you're stretching really is just your muscle,

65
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.250
your muscle fibers in the muscle tissue.
Um,

66
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.990
and the nerves are just sort of chilling around it.

67
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:57.420
But when it gets pinched between the,

68
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:02.290
the fucking anterior cruciate ligament of the lower fucking vertebrate tailbone,

69
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.010
whatever the fuck it is,
all I know is like fuck it.
Fucking pulling a balloon,
um,

70
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.530
on inflate a balloon.
I have no fucking analogy.

71
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.970
I don't know what else I know is it hurts.

72
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:16.200
So I put this guy on this hippy guy and he was just like,
yeah man,

73
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:18.720
what she actually want to do is you don't,

74
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.130
then there's certain stretches that you wanted you and use certain strategies

75
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:27.120
the don't want to do.
And you know,
we're in an age right now and it's,

76
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:31.080
I'm so fucking impatient.
I was trying to skip ahead by just had to sit there,

77
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.400
you know,
everything I could do just to get through a nine minute video.

78
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.950
It's only nine minutes out of my day,

79
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:42.840
but there's like a flat screen TV with NBA and Nhl playoffs going on.

80
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.330
I got other videos I can click on.
You know,

81
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.390
as I'm sitting there trying to listen to this guy,

82
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:52.950
I'm also looking at all the videos on the right,
you know,
there's free porn,

83
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.300
there's all kinds of shit and this guy is just sitting there going,
you know,

84
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.690
okay,
could could stretch that you want to do is is actually,

85
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:03.480
if you just sit down on your buttocks,

86
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:07.980
make sure your weight is on your,
your pelvic bones.
And I was just,

87
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.750
it was driving me fucking insane,
but whatever.

88
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:12.870
I ended up doing the stretches and I and I definitely feel better.
So,
um,

89
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.370
thanks to that guy,

90
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:17.640
whatever his fucking name is and I will definitely be posting those in case

91
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:19.620
anybody else has that problem.

92
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.730
If you just sitting down in a chair and like your feet go numb and shit,

93
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.320
you could possibly have what I have.

94
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.800
Oh,
you got a big dog sitting in your lap,
one or the other.

95
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.090
I have no fucking idea,
but I'm just happy that it,
uh,

96
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.520
that it feels better and um,

97
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.740
I got to tell you all these fucking aches and pains that I'm having.

98
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.630
I knew this a long time ago.

99
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.590
There's nothing better than stretching now that I've gone out and I bought all

100
00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:51.000
this fucking rogue fitness shit.
Um,
so you know,

101
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:56.001
to lift weights and all the atomic grips and all that shit to do the a Ninja

102
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:59.280
warrior stuff,
like the best thing I could be doing all that shit,

103
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.610
that shit's all going to be great.
Provided I fucking stretch.
But um,

104
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.950
<v 4>okay.</v>

105
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.250
<v 1>I Dunno.
I wish I knew way,
way,
way,
way,</v>

106
00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:11.220
fucking back in the day to stretch.

107
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.350
There was no stretching in the 80s you went to Gold's gym.

108
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.690
You just did the old,
you know,

109
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:22.200
you did the stretch you did before you started lifting and Gold's gym back in

110
00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:25.950
the 80s you remember fucking Chevy Chase when he's about ready to jump in the

111
00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:29.110
pool with Christie Brinkley and we wait,
he's going,
this is crazy.
This is crazy.

112
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.500
It's crazy.
You know he's moving his fucking now.
That's what you did.

113
00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:34.260
You did a couple of those and then he did like,

114
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.890
you stuck your arm to the side and you did those fucking,
you know,

115
00:06:37.891 --> 00:06:41.850
touch your left hand to your right toe and up and down.
You know,

116
00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:45.780
one to fucking those military thinks.

117
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.730
Well two,
three,
four,
ah,
love Marine Corps.
You do on that Shit,
right?

118
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.220
Without stretching and then you would just fucking work out.

119
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.980
I fucked up myself so much.
Fucked up my tricep.
I tore a peck,
you know,
you know,

120
00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:00.000
it's funny.
All of this shit's going to come back to haunt.

121
00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:03.180
Meet the next time I lose my fucking a health insurance is someone just listen

122
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:06.330
to this podcast and list everything that I'm talking about is some sort of

123
00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:07.440
preexisting condition.

124
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.013
<v 4>MMM.</v>

125
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.710
<v 1>Yeah.
When you probably need one more pill,
you're,
you're doing well.</v>

126
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.810
How do you keep losing your health insurance?
Well,
because you do an acting Gig,

127
00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:19.690
they pay you one time and then they start sending your residual checks for like

128
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:24.691
a dollar 35 and you have to make 10 grand a year minimum to keep your,

129
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:26.830
uh,
every single year.
You got to make it,

130
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:30.970
you got to make that or something like that to keep your fucking sag after

131
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:34.170
fucking health insurance.
And uh,
you know,

132
00:07:34.171 --> 00:07:37.780
if one year goes by and you're writing a show,

133
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:41.620
rather than being on the show,
you fucking lose your a,
you ended up loose.
I mean,

134
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:42.790
I do anyways.
I haven't done it.

135
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.860
<v 4>Uh,
you know,</v>

136
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.500
<v 1>I haven't done enough acting work,
I guess.
You know,
you'd think with 58,</v>

137
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:53.120
fast and furious,
47,
Friday the 13th,

138
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.770
you'd think I could catch on enough to make 10 grand a year.

139
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.460
You know what?
I'm blaming the fucking after sag health,
health insurance.

140
00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:05.040
I think I got to take this.
Why I got to take this one myself.

141
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.100
I got to look myself in the fucking mirror and be like,
you know what bill?

142
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:10.260
It's your God damn faults your own fucking fault.

143
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.510
Not you just go on and get blue cross blue shield.

144
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.120
That's what I should do and I should just walk away from sag after.
Right.

145
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.300
I don't fucking know.
I'm a big advocate of that.
You know?

146
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.920
Looking yourself in the mirror and being like,
all right,
you fucked up.

147
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.040
As opposed to being like,
you know the world is unfair,

148
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.030
which everybody knows it is.
Right.
But if you say,
all right,

149
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:34.340
I fucked up that it actually gives you an option to be okay,

150
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.700
what can I do to lessen the fuck up?
Because I know I'm going to fuck up again.

151
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.630
You know,
like if you're like Caitlyn Jenner right now,

152
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.430
rather than fucking filming yourself taking a Piss and Trump's tower,
you know,

153
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.040
why don't you just look yourself in the mirror and be like,
all right,

154
00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:53.970
how did I fuck this up?
You know,
for the first 66 years of my life,

155
00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:57.550
I had a definitive bathroom to go into.
There wasn't any questions,

156
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.090
nor did I have to film myself.
And then afterwards say I didn't molest anybody.

157
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.320
What has happened to that person?
You know,

158
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.400
that that person has absolutely lost their fucking mind.

159
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.030
Who's walking around filming themselves,
taking a Piss,

160
00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:16.180
and then talking about child molesters.
And I know what people would say,
Oh,

161
00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:21.180
you can't have these fucking a former guys with boobs.
Now they have,
you know,

162
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.120
you know,
they're transitioning people,
you,
they're gonna fucking molest somebody,

163
00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:26.020
blah blah blah,
blah,
blah.

164
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.930
I know that that's what that whole fucking thing was supposed to be about.

165
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.430
But you know,
I don't know.
That just came off to me,

166
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.150
shameless self promotion.
I don't have anything against transgendered people,

167
00:09:37.151 --> 00:09:41.510
but that's fucking dig bat.
It's funny cause you're the big,

168
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.530
bad is the proper word because you know she identifies with the female sex.

169
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.750
I think dig bet now works as opposed to Douche bag.

170
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:56.050
See I kept the Dhea when I went illiteration ice could never fully,

171
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.650
you know what?

172
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.510
I would never call Bruce a douche bag cause he was on the Wheaties box.

173
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.320
You know,
I dunno about this Katelyn though.
That's what the jury is still out.

174
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.790
Oh Bruce did kill somebody.
You don't accidentally,

175
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.500
Caitlin has yet to accidentally kill somebody.
So you know,

176
00:10:14.501 --> 00:10:17.860
there's a lot of mass to be done.
You know what?
I strike all that.
I think.

177
00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:21.040
I think uh,
she was right to film yourself peeing in a skyscraper.

178
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.030
You know,
whenever I see a video like that,

179
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:29.880
I always wonder if people who are truly suffering around the world,

180
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:32.970
if they ever get access to a laptop and it just,

181
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:36.180
somehow that comes up on their fucking youtube page.
You know what I mean?

182
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.030
They're just living like,

183
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.020
like those people that like Brazil that live in those fucking trash heaps.

184
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:47.880
If somehow they see fucking Caitlyn Jenner walking around acting like a victim,

185
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.440
you know,

186
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.370
we're in shoes that they probably fucking so together at three o'clock in the

187
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:53.800
fucking room

188
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.633
<v 0>morning.</v>

189
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.690
<v 1>Oh,
I know.
I know.
You're supposed to care about everything.
Um,</v>

190
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.520
I don't,
I don't give a fuck.
You know what I give a shit about right now?
Cy,

191
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:11.510
Anika coming to the providence.
Oh,

192
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.440
so Wurster provenance,
civic center.
Worcester Civic Center.
No.

193
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.940
Ah,
fuck.
I can't even remember.
That's all I give a shit about.

194
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:24.420
I give a shit about,
um,
I don't know,

195
00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:28.800
being able to fucking reach down and pick up a dirty sock without having a

196
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:32.280
fucking bolt of lightening go down the back of my leg.
That would be nice.
Right?

197
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:34.950
Maybe I'm transitioning,

198
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:38.970
I'm transitioning into a fucking old man right before my very eyes,
you know,

199
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:43.320
my fucking dog has just been,
he just sleeps all damn day.
It's unbuilt.
I know.

200
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:45.840
I always bring this shit up,
but it,
it just blows me away.

201
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.950
I walked you around the block.
It's it,
it's all there was.

202
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.380
Um,
anyway,
so I've been watching now as much as I can.

203
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.490
Um,
my wife's been on the road so I,
uh,

204
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.670
I've immediately become a,
a,
a bachelor.
However,

205
00:12:05.671 --> 00:12:08.580
I've kept this place pretty clean,
you know,

206
00:12:08.581 --> 00:12:12.690
and that's a very important thing to do when you're married is when your spouse

207
00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:17.220
leaves,
you have to fuck could show them that you can live without them.

208
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.350
I think that's a huge fucking thing.

209
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.370
Like she so wants to come home and just see this fucking place in absolute like

210
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.020
see that you couldn't live without me,
you know what I mean?
Which I couldn't,

211
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.720
I would be fucking devastated if she fucking left or anything.

212
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.550
Obviously I would be,
but you know what I mean?

213
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.130
You do have to have a little bit of self esteem.

214
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.680
So I've gone back to the way I used to live.
Like I have one plate,

215
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:41.460
one fork,

216
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.460
that's all I'm music and I just put it in the sink and if I need another one,

217
00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:48.090
I just watched that one.
It's great.
It's nice and quick.

218
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.120
Saves a lot of water.
Right?

219
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.670
Ed Begley Jr would be so fucking happy with me right now.
One plate,

220
00:12:56.671 --> 00:12:58.860
one fork.
I'm really into that type of shit.

221
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.870
And that's very hard to be into that type of shit.

222
00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:04.800
We're now when you have a woman in your life,
you know,
not having a lot of stuff

223
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.980
because,
uh,
bitches be like and stuff.

224
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.200
I don't know what it is.
They can't get enough for fucking Amazon.

225
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.470
I wonder what percentage of people are,
you know,
there's some fucking guy,

226
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:22.140
but that doctor did a feminine straight doctor that helped me with Siad car.

227
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.760
Um,
I bet he's on Amazon all the time,
you know,

228
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.080
trying to find a new pair of fucking puffy pants to match his sandals.
I'm,

229
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.130
isn't it amazing that this guy helped me out the way he did and I'm so fucking

230
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:36.220
damaged to the human as a human being,
then I still have to make fun of them.

231
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.603
<v 4>MMM.</v>

232
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.020
<v 1>And will,
you know what would you want it for me?</v>

233
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.630
<v 4>Okay.</v>

234
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.700
<v 1>So anyways,
the update with the gym.
All right.</v>

235
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.820
I'll actually show you guys before and after pictures when,
uh,

236
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.450
when I'm done because,
uh,
it's just a fucking garage.

237
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.630
I don't give a shit if you see that.
So I got the peg board up.

238
00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.353
<v 4>MMM.</v>

239
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.610
<v 1>I actually,
what I had before was,
you know,
those,
um,</v>

240
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.790
you know those really long pegboards where your arms are really close together

241
00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:07.500
and they're like,
they go on for fucking ever.

242
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.203
<v 4>MMM.</v>

243
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.970
<v 1>You know,
my garage,
you know,
it has like a fucking eight foot ceiling.</v>

244
00:14:12.971 --> 00:14:16.170
So that wasn't an option.
So I bought two of those and mounted them sideways.

245
00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:20.190
So I,
it's just,
just do the pegboard exercise sideways.

246
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.070
You don't try to go all the way down and then come all the way back.

247
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.010
And I'm now where they moved them,

248
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.340
they actually cut them in half and put all four side by side.

249
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.970
So the goal is eventually to go up one down the other,

250
00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:37.440
up to third and down the fourth.
I got that up,
I got the speed bag up.

251
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.990
Uh,
that's more for my wife.
She's into that shit.

252
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.270
I don't give a fuck about that.
You know,
that's always,

253
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:48.300
that was a big thing when I was growing up having a heavy bag and all that shit,

254
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.591
you know,

255
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:51.670
and then people thought they were tougher because they were hitting the heavy

256
00:14:51.671 --> 00:14:55.360
bag that has no fucking arms and legs.
You know,
you're basically just,
you,

257
00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:56.530
you were beaten up,
you know,

258
00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.970
you basically practicing to fight a cripple is all you're really doing.
I mean,

259
00:15:00.971 --> 00:15:03.340
granted there was cardio involved,

260
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.960
but actually I remember a long time ago seeing a fucking guy with no arms and no

261
00:15:07.961 --> 00:15:12.430
legs as a wrestler and nobody could beat him.
They just,

262
00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:14.740
there was nothing to hook and he and he would just do,

263
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.100
I don't know what he was doing,
but he would somehow flip these.
It was like,

264
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:20.500
can you just imagine wrestling just a rock?

265
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.410
But it was a long flat one and somehow it fucking could move.

266
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.773
<v 4>Okay.</v>

267
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.920
<v 1>And it had a head on it.
I don't know how to describe this fucking kid.</v>

268
00:15:31.921 --> 00:15:35.700
All I know is he was winning.
So maybe,
maybe there is something about that,

269
00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:36.930
you know,
what,
can I backtrack?

270
00:15:36.931 --> 00:15:40.320
I don't think I've had one at one point that I've made in this entire podcast

271
00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:43.590
that I haven't,
I haven't retracted from,
well,
you know what,

272
00:15:43.591 --> 00:15:45.060
it's a fucking election year.

273
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.553
<v 4>MMM.</v>

274
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.850
<v 1>What's the guy's name was?
Who was the other guy running other than Donald Trump.</v>

275
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.330
<v 4>Okay.</v>

276
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.680
<v 1>Hillary Clinton kidding.
Ted Cruz.
Ted Cruz.</v>

277
00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:58.880
I don't know anything about Ted Cruz,

278
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:02.750
but evidently he's really interested about where Caitlin Jenner drops a fucking

279
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:07.280
deuce and Caitlyn made a fucking oh,
snapchat fucking video of right.

280
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.520
Is that what happened?
Is that what happened on fucking Facebook this week?

281
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:11.820
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

282
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.340
<v 1>I'm still out of the loop.
Everybody.
So out of the loop,</v>

283
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:19.930
just can you guys just ride with me for the next couple of fucking months as I

284
00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:22.660
spend my entire waking hours in a fucking writer's room.

285
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.360
I don't fucking see anything.
I don't read anything.

286
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.920
We just stare at a computer screen.

287
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:29.890
I'm going to need fucking glasses by the time I'm done with this shit.

288
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.140
My Act is drying up.
Thank you.

289
00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:34.090
Know what I'm sitting is shitting on Caitlyn Jenner.

290
00:16:34.091 --> 00:16:38.170
Thank God she fucking made that video cause I ended up getting a great bit out

291
00:16:38.171 --> 00:16:42.420
of it this weekend.
I fucked it up the first time.
Um,

292
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.730
and then the next time it,
it,
uh,
it worked.
So,

293
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:46.873
<v 4>uh,</v>

294
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.820
<v 1>that's always great.
You know,
you gotta Love Topical Material.</v>

295
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:54.290
Topical material is like the Doritos of fucking stand up.
You know what I mean?

296
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.990
It's fucking,
it's so fucking satisfying.

297
00:16:56.991 --> 00:17:00.500
But there's just no nutrition in it whatsoever.

298
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.473
<v 4>MMM.</v>

299
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.850
<v 1>But anyways,
like I was saying before,
I went down to the the uh,</v>

300
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.050
<v 4>okay.</v>

301
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.040
<v 1>The comedy store and duty Kenny,
I can't fucking believe it.</v>

302
00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:15.800
It looks like a God damn nightclub.
There's all these young people in there,

303
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:19.640
there's beautiful women all dressed up and shit.
Just having a great time.

304
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:24.470
Like it's like,
I don't know,
I wasn't around during the 80s,
but I don't know.

305
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.353
Um,

306
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:26.990
<v 4>okay.</v>

307
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.990
<v 1>I Dunno how it could have been any better just as far as the sheer amount of</v>

308
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:32.240
people coming out in there.
And they are laughers too.

309
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:33.920
So if you are in the La area,

310
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.513
<v 4>mmm.</v>

311
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.510
<v 1>It's a good time to go down there.
And,
um,
I was on,
you know,
the shows I was on,</v>

312
00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:43.270
it was just fucking one monster fucking comic after another.

313
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:44.760
That's probably another reason.

314
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.533
<v 4>MMM.</v>

315
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.070
<v 1>Like one of my favorites,
I consider him a new guys.
Uh,</v>

316
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.820
Krista Leah who goes down there.

317
00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:56.000
And what I love about that guy is just as a standup comic,

318
00:17:56.001 --> 00:18:00.110
I love seeing a legitimate headliner.
You know,

319
00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.250
there's a lot of people that can sell tickets because they're on TV or they did

320
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:08.900
a movie thing or they took a piss and Donald Trump's fucking tower,
right?

321
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.910
Caitlyn Jenner would sell out of fucking Improv.

322
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.680
But there's very few people that could basically follow anybody go out there and

323
00:18:15.681 --> 00:18:19.490
really level,
like the,
the,
the,

324
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.300
the point at which that you have to level to really be considered a fucking

325
00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:28.070
headliner.
And,
uh,
this guy fucking does it.
So,
um,

326
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.120
yeah,
man,
there was a bunch of people like,
who the fuck was on the show?

327
00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.710
I went on if the Dane Cook,
he fucking murdered.
Um,

328
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.440
I got there late on that one.

329
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.140
And then the next show I was working with Chris Delea

330
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.680
<v 4>and,
um,</v>

331
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.090
<v 1>the Chashu Lazaro was on Bobby Lee,</v>

332
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:55.340
by the way,
speaking to Natasha.
Did anybody see the new dice clay fucking series?

333
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.360
I love it.
Did you see age?
Oh my God,
I'm a fuck up.
His name is at Adrian Brody.

334
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.860
Why don't I know anybody's name?

335
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.310
He did this whole fucking thing where he was playing himself and he was,
uh,

336
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.420
you know,
and in his next acting role was to play dice clay,

337
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.860
Andrew dice clay in a bio pic.
So the whole episode,

338
00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:19.520
he's trying to get dice.
I don't want to ruin it.
Just fucking watch it.

339
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:23.600
His dice clay is his fucking tremendous.
And um,

340
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.600
I don't know,
speaking of the Worcester Centrum,

341
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.690
I've always been a huge dice clay fan and I saw him,

342
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:34.760
I know I've told this story before,
but that's where I saw him in like 1988.

343
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.250
I saw him,
uh,
at the Worcester Centrum,
um,

344
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:45.020
with an unknown Eddie Griffin opening up.
And uh,

345
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.610
it was sick.
He fucking murdered.
He did a drum solo at the end of the end.

346
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.140
It was one of the sickest shows I ever saw.
And uh,

347
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.160
I still didn't realize that I wanted to be a comedian,
so fucking dumb.
I was,

348
00:19:58.161 --> 00:19:58.971
when I was growing up,
do you know,

349
00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:03.830
he used to memorize comedy albums and I would ride around my bicycle,
you know,

350
00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.060
doing my paper route.

351
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.130
We citing those at those albums pretending I was doing them in the,

352
00:20:10.131 --> 00:20:12.800
in the school auditorium in front of the entire school.

353
00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:14.840
And it's still never dawned on me like,
hey bill,

354
00:20:14.841 --> 00:20:18.950
that probably means that you want to be a comedian.
Like I'd never,

355
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.820
it never fucking done,
it seemed like it was a million miles away.
You know,

356
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.110
we didn't have youtube,

357
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.193
<v 4>you know,</v>

358
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.540
<v 1>could just film yourself taking a shit at a dairy queen and say,</v>

359
00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:34.810
take that presidential candidate there.
You,

360
00:20:34.811 --> 00:20:38.900
you couldn't fucking do that back then.
Um,
anyways,

361
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.190
so as always I'm going to talk about another car that I like and that I probably

362
00:20:43.191 --> 00:20:44.060
will never buy.

363
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.360
I was watching something on that Tesla s and it's like the self driving fucking

364
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:52.450
car and these two guys like computer,
look at guys,

365
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.100
I'll say that because they both had glasses.

366
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:58.060
So if you have glasses in my world that means you're smart and a lot of people's

367
00:20:58.061 --> 00:21:01.870
world it meets that you know.
But you know I want to be politically correct.

368
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:06.340
Maybe they were both a couple of fuck heads but anyways they were in this car

369
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:06.880
and uh,

370
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.880
they put on this self driving mode and according to the video they put blankets

371
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:14.170
over themselves and they took a fucking nap.

372
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.090
Now Tesla's said that there's some alarming youtube videos of people doing shit

373
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.190
in their cars that you're not supposed to be doing,

374
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.470
but they basically took a nap and then somebody wrote in one of the comments

375
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:34.000
underneath it like,
would you get arrested if you got shit faced,

376
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.090
put it on self driving mode and then sat in the back seat

377
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.150
and you don't make,
you don't know me.
Maybe you think you know me,

378
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:45.190
but I'm always bitching about technology.

379
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:49.720
I actually am coming around to the self driving car.

380
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.650
Just provided that you could still drive it if you want to.
Um,

381
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.520
cause that is dead is pretty fucking cool.
Do you realize,
wow,

382
00:21:56.521 --> 00:22:00.520
how fucking artist shape intellect?
He,
you know,

383
00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:03.460
how bad like this is going to be for procrastinators?
Yeah.

384
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.010
You know the fact that they no longer have to drive themselves to work and

385
00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:11.160
they're going to be trying to finish their fucking presentation in their car.

386
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:12.301
You know,

387
00:22:12.301 --> 00:22:15.780
you've seen people brushing their teeth or just people literally with an eye

388
00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:16.614
mask on,

389
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.240
just fucking sleeping in the jam jams and then they pull up to work.

390
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:26.280
You know like you set your car alarm and that's like your fucking alarm to wake

391
00:22:26.281 --> 00:22:30.510
you up.
Like when it stops and is in park,
you know,

392
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.830
maybe the horn just goes bad,
bad,
bad.

393
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.090
That'd be too jarring.
That'd be too jarring for people are the future.
Right.

394
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.120
They don't want to fucking deal with anything.
They just want to lay around.

395
00:22:42.121 --> 00:22:45.230
Right.
So they'd fucking let you lay there in the car.
And I,
you know,

396
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.300
those fucking creepy self vibrating fucking seats.

397
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.220
When you get too close to something,
maybe it does that you're just laying there,

398
00:22:53.221 --> 00:22:56.940
right.
And it just sort of shakes you a little bit and some weird creepy computer

399
00:22:56.941 --> 00:23:00.190
voice.
She could pick the voice too.
Right?
You know,

400
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.960
God knows celebrities will jump all over that they do the fucking voiceovers to

401
00:23:03.961 --> 00:23:07.890
make a little bit of cash because no one pays for movies anymore.

402
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.310
And they're just sick of being in those mighty heroes.
Fucking superhero movies,

403
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.560
one after another.
They're literally out of ideas.
Huh?
I mean,

404
00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:20.310
once you have like the superheroes fighting each other that they gotta be

405
00:23:20.311 --> 00:23:23.070
nervous in Hollywood just going like,
where,
where do we go from here?

406
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.133
<v 0>You know,</v>

407
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.740
<v 1>can we reboot this thing again?</v>

408
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.970
Can we reboot the fucking joker and all they'd be know what the funny thing is

409
00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:34.190
so is people will keep showing up.

410
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.760
I guess that makes sense,
right?

411
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.260
God knows they've had the comic books forever and people keep reading those.

412
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.150
You know what?
I'm taking that one back.
I'm wrong about that one again.

413
00:23:44.151 --> 00:23:47.330
Have I been right?
Fuck.

414
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.550
Bunch of swings and misses.
Um,
so anyways,

415
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:57.551
that Tesla as has another feature where you can like call the car like a fucking

416
00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:02.030
dog.
Like if it's in a tight parking spot,
you can,
you just go here,

417
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:04.880
hey,
tests the test,
what tests can I buddy?

418
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.490
You want to go for a drive?
Right.
And,
uh,

419
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.540
the thing just slowly backs up and it comes to you.
It's literally,

420
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:18.050
it's like the fucking night rider car.
And like I said,

421
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:21.290
I am usually anti technology and um,

422
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.360
but every once in a while something comes along and I,

423
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.340
and I even meet as much as was fucking freckled content.
I am,

424
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.120
I have to sit back and be like,
you know what?
That's cool.
So here's the thing,

425
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.840
the car costs like,
I dunno,
like $120,000.

426
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.510
So I imagine 90% of the people,
you know,

427
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.340
not trying to talk down to you,
okay,

428
00:24:43.341 --> 00:24:47.140
we'll say 80% of you that listen to this fucking thing,
right?

429
00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.460
Just went like og teachers.
I'll never be able to afford the EA.
You will.

430
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:56.350
I'll tell you why.
Okay,
I'll give you,
I'll give you fucking three examples.

431
00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.890
Calculators,
rollerblades and flat screen TVs,
all of those things.

432
00:25:00.891 --> 00:25:03.980
When they came out,
they were fucking ridiculously expensive.

433
00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.750
And then by the end of it,

434
00:25:05.751 --> 00:25:08.510
they gave him away with like a free tank of fucking gas.

435
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.310
Well maybe not the fucking flat screens,

436
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:13.400
but you remember like we'll go back to calc worn calculators first came out,

437
00:25:13.401 --> 00:25:18.010
they were $100 each,
something crazy like that.
And then they just,

438
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.420
they just kept dropping,
dropping,
dropping,
dropping,

439
00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:23.210
dropping is more and more people bought them and then they had the solar ones

440
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:26.080
and the next thing you know you got a calculator with the fucking free fill up

441
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.870
at the gas station.
Roller blades were always over 100 bucks,
right?

442
00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:31.730
And then everybody had them and then like,

443
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:33.500
well what the fuck are we going to do with the rest of them?

444
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.560
And next thing you know,
they was 30 bucks,
right?

445
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.070
Flatscreen TVs when they first came out.

446
00:25:40.071 --> 00:25:44.990
I F I for some reason remember them to be about 11 grant when they first came

447
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:47.270
out,
you know,
and they were about to stick as my fucking head.

448
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.550
Let me look this up here.
Original price,
original price

449
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.740
of flat screen TV's.

450
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.040
I'm saying 11 grand flatscreen flatscreen falling costs of flat screens

451
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.010
had the farm.
Jesus Christ,
I'll never find it.
Oh,

452
00:26:11.011 --> 00:26:14.400
the price was 14,090 almost 15 grand,

453
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.710
$999 for a plasma TV,
plasma display,
TV,
Yada,

454
00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:23.970
Yada,
Yada.
Advantages,
disadvantages.
Where the fuck was it?

455
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.440
History.
So we'll go to the two thousands,

456
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.680
2000,
the 40 inch TV cost.
Uh,

457
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.090
you know what?
Go Fuck Yourself.

458
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.940
I don't know where the fuck or was it actually came up and then I clicked on it

459
00:26:38.941 --> 00:26:43.270
and then the inflammation disappears.
Um,
sorry about that.
I'm just saying,

460
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:47.770
so I bet that the test that technology

461
00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.500
will,
will,
you know,
it's like when airbags first came out,

462
00:26:53.501 --> 00:26:56.320
they were on Mercedes.
They protected the rich people first.

463
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.800
And then once they got all the rich people's money,
then they go,
all right,

464
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.740
you know what?
Maybe we'll protect the middle class.

465
00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.980
And then eventually it gets all the way down to like,
you know,

466
00:27:05.981 --> 00:27:08.950
like there's starving kids in Africa.
They probably have roller blades,

467
00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.533
you know what I mean?

468
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:11.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>

469
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.740
<v 1>And like a Chicago Blackhawks 2016,
uh,</v>

470
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.820
advanced to the second round tee shirt.
Right.
You know,

471
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.460
they would get those fucking to get those hats

472
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.800
like Boston red sox in 1986 world series champions.

473
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:31.380
It's always somebody digging for a blood diamond wearing that shit.

474
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.260
Buffalo bills four in a row,
you know,

475
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.440
that's like what a sex slave tee shirt,
you know,

476
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.920
sexually wears over and fucking done on one of those sex slave countries.

477
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.890
Are you making light of the sex human sex trade?
No,
I'm just talking.

478
00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:48.540
I'll make in front of the buffalo bills there.

479
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.300
I fail for the person that has two was sold into sex slavery.
But I,

480
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.510
I don't feel bad for the buffalo bills.
You know what I mean?

481
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.690
You know why they lost all four of those cause nice guys finish last in Marv

482
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.030
Levy is everything that Pete Carroll looks like he is

483
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.480
Pete Carroll is is Marv Levy 2.0 both of them just look like you could just

484
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:14.070
trust them.
You know,
I could leave,

485
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:17.000
I could leave a stack of fucking cash here right in front of him.

486
00:28:17.001 --> 00:28:19.590
My life savings,
I will come back and I'm going to be fine.

487
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.460
And that is true with Marv Levy and that's why he lost four Superbowls.

488
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.660
Now if you were to leave that with Pete Carroll,
you know,
I,
I'm,
you know,

489
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.870
I don't think I have to tell you that.
You know,

490
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.530
there'd be some Hooters chicks over there and scared wing sauce on his face and

491
00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:38.250
be like,
yeah,
it's all there.
Fuck you talking about.
Um,

492
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:42.420
why am I shitting on Pete Carroll and know what you think of bill or to buy your

493
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:45.330
couch.
What about fucking,
what about bill Bellacheck?
Well,

494
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.740
he doesn't look wholesome.

495
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.290
He looks like a mean dad.
Doesn't eat like a dad's home.

496
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.160
God,
he's such a Douche,
you know,
that's,
that's what it looks like.

497
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:03.420
Pete Carroll looks like,
you know,
be careful.
Looks like he goes to church,

498
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.360
you know,
and on the third day,

499
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.150
Jesus will rise again and then he's in the back and goes,

500
00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.293
<v 5>wow,</v>

501
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.100
<v 1>that paty always gets excited during that part of the Jesus Story.</v>

502
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.290
Oh,
um,
oh,

503
00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:24.000
what the fuck was with that guy?
You know,

504
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.720
I actually tweeted about that guy in the draft that got busted,
you know,

505
00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.450
wearing the fucking gas mass,
taking the fucking we'd hit and uh,

506
00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.420
everybody gave me shit.
You did watch the draft.
It's like,
dude,

507
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.860
it kind of became,
it went viral actually.
Uh,

508
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:45.440
I was actually texted to me by a,
uh,
another comedian was letting me know.

509
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:49.700
They said in real time this guy was getting blackmailed and uh,

510
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.430
I ended up watching the clips.
Dude,
that was,

511
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.330
that guy should fire his fucking agent yesterday.

512
00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:02.240
That poor bastard,
nobody,
he had no advice,
but he was sitting there sweating.

513
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.170
If nobody came out is that woman didn't say,
Hey,
hey,
that's enough.

514
00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:08.480
No more questions.
If she didn't rescue him,

515
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.950
that guy would still be sitting there like pouring sweat,

516
00:30:12.951 --> 00:30:15.650
answering ever every fucking question that they asked him.

517
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.610
What's the most fucked up thing you ever jerked off to?
Well,
I would have to say,

518
00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:24.770
uh,
you know,
it's just like,
I don't know where his agent was,
but um,

519
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.920
he was somewhere high fiving himself,
I think.
Ah,

520
00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.690
God damn it that Tesla is a good looking car from the side.

521
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.350
I just hate the front end.
It's just weird.
You know,

522
00:30:36.351 --> 00:30:37.610
cause it doesn't need a fucking,

523
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.270
doesn't need a grill cause it doesn't have a radiator cause it doesn't have an

524
00:30:41.271 --> 00:30:45.830
engine to fucking,
you know,
cool off or whatever.

525
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.200
I was going to say,
well it'd be cool if they just put it in there anyways,

526
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:53.140
but then air would get trapped and then it was actually slow down to that's the

527
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:56.020
fucking car.
That's the car you want.
That thing is,
it's fast.

528
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.570
It's actually beats a fucking Lamborghini.

529
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:02.620
It beats a Ferrari zero to 60 if fucking smokes,

530
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:05.560
that car literally smokes a fucking supercar.

531
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.080
Now when they get up into the higher gears,
this,
you know,

532
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:12.050
fucking 70 80 miles an hour,
the Ferrari overtakes it.

533
00:31:12.051 --> 00:31:16.970
Who gives a fuck?
Gives a fuck 80 90 miles an hour.

534
00:31:16.971 --> 00:31:19.790
I mean,
I guess if the only reason to want a car going that fast,

535
00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:20.900
if you take it to the track,

536
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.570
if you fucking drive a hundred miles an hour on a regular street,

537
00:31:23.571 --> 00:31:27.050
you're a fucking asshole and you're going to kill somebody.
So,
um,

538
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.110
you know what?
God dammit,
I think I'm going to get that car.
Oh Jesus.

539
00:31:33.111 --> 00:31:34.940
That's a good looking car.
Get it in black.
Huh?

540
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.570
With the red fucking cow pus.

541
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.240
I'm too fucking,
I'm too frugal.
Can't blow hundred 20,000.
What are the,

542
00:31:44.241 --> 00:31:46.100
what's the fucking car payment on that?

543
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.600
It's a fucking moron.

544
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:53.870
You could buy a third of Detroit for the amount of money you're going to pay for

545
00:31:53.871 --> 00:31:56.900
a fucking Tesla.
That's insane.
You know,

546
00:31:56.901 --> 00:32:00.710
I watched the trashy fucking youtube videos and I really have to stop doing it

547
00:32:00.711 --> 00:32:01.530
because everything,

548
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:06.290
like for some reason I was looking at the top 10 inappropriate police officer

549
00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:10.130
pictures posted online.
And then once you do that,

550
00:32:10.131 --> 00:32:15.110
then you're just stuck in this thing.
Top 10 things banned in the United States.

551
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.250
Inappropriate family photos that will make you cringe.
You know,

552
00:32:19.251 --> 00:32:21.980
most of them are staged,
but you still sit there and watch it.

553
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:25.700
The top 10 fucking creepy things ever dug up.

554
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:30.140
The top 10 weird things in the background is some Hor took a picture of her

555
00:32:30.141 --> 00:32:35.060
fucking ass and a thong.
10 most dangerous gangs in the world.
All right,

556
00:32:35.061 --> 00:32:38.990
I'll look at this guys.
All fucking tattooed up holding the

557
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.230
can have the most dangerous gangs in the world.
This is what I do.
Well,

558
00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:51.620
my wife's side of town,
I watch playoff hockey and then I,

559
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.530
I had that on and then I fucking sit here and I look at this shit.

560
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.540
15 most poisonous animals in the world.
You know what it is?

561
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:01.970
I've seen every fail video at this point.

562
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:06.810
I've seen every people are awesome video.
Um,

563
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.960
I seen every fight video.
I've seen every instant Karma bully thing.

564
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:17.540
I,
I just,
I just feel like I've seen everything that I give a fuck about.

565
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.670
Instant Karmas fails five most dangerous people in the world.

566
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:26.730
10 X,
10 x 10 actors who actually did it on screen.

567
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.960
I didn't see that.
Wait a minute.
What the fuck is this?

568
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:32.420
One C and now I'm not going to watch the most dangerous gangs.

569
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:33.930
You know what's funny is much.

570
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.810
Most of you will make it fun of me right now and the other,

571
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.640
the rest of you are googling the shit right now.

572
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:39.543
<v 4>MMM.</v>

573
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.750
<v 1>So anyways,
uh,
see if I can,
any questions about my fucking,</v>

574
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.070
Andrew sent me the fucking questions yet because I don't have any advertising.

575
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:49.821
I ain't got nothing.

576
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:52.670
I'm trying to get this shit out of the fucking way because I've got to do a

577
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:56.480
radio tour next week to hype all my dates coming up in Florida.
Bill,

578
00:33:56.481 --> 00:34:00.770
you coming to Florida?
You didn't mention that.
Oh yeah.

579
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.290
Going to all the big cities too.

580
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:09.010
I'm going to a Orlando right home of Disney world now.

581
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:14.870
Like that small shit out here,
right?
Just Disneyland.
This is Disney world.

582
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:15.680
Uh,

583
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.680
May 6th I'm going to be at the seminal hard rock hotel and a casino in

584
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:25.850
Hollywood,
Florida.
Then I'm going to be at the hard rock live in Orlando,

585
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:30.470
Florida doing two shows.
And then on May 8th,

586
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.590
I'll be at the Times Union Center for the Performing Arts,

587
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:38.480
Morin Morin Modal Theater,
uh,
in Jacksonville,

588
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:42.320
Florida.
Um,
and hopefully I'll get their fucking early enough.

589
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:45.170
I can go to a gun range and suits some fucking guns with silences.

590
00:34:45.171 --> 00:34:46.010
That's some fun shit.

591
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:47.743
<v 4>MMM.</v>

592
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.520
<v 1>God Damn it.
That's a good time.</v>

593
00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:54.060
Jacksonville is underrated under fucking rated city to go to,

594
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.620
I know a lot of people shit on,
you know,
northern Florida.

595
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:03.360
But uh,
I gotta be honest with you.
I love a shit town.
You know,

596
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.750
there's fun to be had.
Anybody can go to fucking Miami,

597
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.630
go to some fucking Botox party,

598
00:35:09.631 --> 00:35:11.430
whatever the fuck it is those people do down there.

599
00:35:11.431 --> 00:35:14.460
It's like you're not pretty enough.
You've got to fucking laminate you face.

600
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.840
You know,
they're just weird.
I like being in those,
you know,
Tampa,

601
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:25.590
Clearwater,
Tallahassee,
Orlando,

602
00:35:25.591 --> 00:35:28.750
Jacksonville.
Orlando is not even bad.
Atlanta is like,
um,

603
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.820
sort of like Orange County.
It just sort of a,

604
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.970
I dunno,
it has that mcmansion vibe,
you know?
Um,

605
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.241
I don't know,

606
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:42.330
but a lot of people live out that way because there's no state income tax.

607
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.380
That's why so many of Burt Reynolds ended up going out there.
Oj Simpson,

608
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.520
you know,
all the people that had rough course cases,
you know,
double murders,

609
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:53.100
divorces,
all of that shit.
You know,
they all end up in Florida.

610
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:57.900
That's when you know,
you know,
you know,
as you get fucking older,

611
00:35:57.901 --> 00:35:58.830
I think he just,
that's,

612
00:35:58.831 --> 00:36:03.420
that's one of the major signs that you were basically a very successful but

613
00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:06.450
married.
The wrong person slash may be killed.
Somebody is,

614
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:10.290
you end up in Florida if you're not like indigenous to that area.
Ooh,

615
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:14.250
bell indigenous.
Somebody learned a fucking word,
Huh?
All right.

616
00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:17.220
Let's see if I can read some advertising here for the God damn week.

617
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:22.560
The God damn week of May 2nd.
You know,
I always make like a,
um,

618
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.110
a mental note to myself,
uh,
at the beginning of May.

619
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.260
Even though I live out here in la,
in the fucker,
weather's always great.

620
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:35.130
I cause like I'd always just remember like I always be working and I'd be

621
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:36.240
psyched that Lou was May.

622
00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:39.570
And then before I realized that it was in the August and I was thinking like,

623
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:43.110
wow,
the first 90 days of this shit,

624
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.400
at least may and June.
I think people,
a lot of people take may and June,

625
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.690
June for fucking granted.

626
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.293
<v 4>MMM.</v>

627
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.390
<v 1>I mean,
I don't know who I'm even speaking to at this point.</v>

628
00:36:53.391 --> 00:36:55.310
Does anybody really even have four seasons anymore?

629
00:36:55.311 --> 00:36:57.860
But if you still live in an area like this is the time where you gotta be like,

630
00:36:57.861 --> 00:37:01.490
all right,
let's make the most of the decent weather.
All right?
Okay.

631
00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:03.770
Now for that shit.
Let me read some of the,
uh,

632
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.000
some of the advertising here for this week.
All right.
Sherry's berries.

633
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.480
<v 4>Okay.</v>

634
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.140
<v 1>Mother's Day is this weekend only x,
x days away.
Oh,</v>

635
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.460
I guess I'm supposed to fill that in.
Well,
I'm reading this on a May 1st.

636
00:37:18.461 --> 00:37:23.310
So it's seven days away.
It's,
um,
it's May 8th this year.
Uh,

637
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.060
there was no one quite like your mom.

638
00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:29.460
Every mom is unique and we wouldn't want to change a thing.
Uh,

639
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:34.270
talk about your mom or your wife's corks.
Funny stories or sayings.

640
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:38.860
Oh yeah.
Uh,
let's see.
Uh,
I never tell my mother when I'm on TV.

641
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:43.250
<v 4>Okay.</v>

642
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:47.960
<v 1>Because she's a mom and no matter what I do,
she's going to give me shit.
Ah,</v>

643
00:37:47.961 --> 00:37:50.840
you know what?
I don't understand why you wore that shirt.

644
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.440
I liked your performance on Conan better than on the tonight show.

645
00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.650
Um,
no,
I love my mom,
but you know what I mean.
She,
she is like,
she's,

646
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:04.950
she's my original like Twitter troll my entire life.
I mean,

647
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.960
one of the reasons why I'm so driven is to just one day have a show or a fucking

648
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:15.470
whatever,
whatever the fuck he called doing a talk show,

649
00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.680
We're wired a wire.
She actually goes like,
you know what?

650
00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:23.270
I sat down and I watched it and I don't have a problem with anything you did.

651
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.390
You know?

I don't know.
Uh,
get some fucking me on these.
Yap.
All right.
Mandy's,

704
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.550
whether you're werewolf,
they're almost went off the rails.

705
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:40.190
Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

706
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.830
you spend almost 24 hours a day and your underwear.

707
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:46.490
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

708
00:41:46.491 --> 00:41:50.600
clothes,
your underwear's probably boring me on is here to change that.

709
00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.290
MMM.
Every pair of me.

710
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.640

711
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.200
a fabric that is twice as soft as cotton.

712
00:41:59.201 --> 00:42:03.730
Nothing get described the fit and feel of me undies.
But once you try him on,

713
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:08.230
you'll understand why they're called the most comfortable Goddamn motherfucking

714
00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.330
underwear in the world.
And that is a quote.

715
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.200
And if you don't love your first pair of me undies,
they are free.

716
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.310
No questions asked me.

717
00:42:15.311 --> 00:42:19.150
And he says dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help make you make a

718
00:42:19.151 --> 00:42:24.140
statement hog.
You're like dead deck.
You like dead Dick Curtin.

719
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.960
Um,
and make with your underwear.
Well,

720
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.130
whether anyone can see them or not.
Remember Superman.
All right.

This is the offer or call to action here.

728
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.370
Mandy's.
Buy a pair for your mom.

729
00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.760
You like both of them cause you're related.

730
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.160
Now that fucking crutches are ventilated.
There we go.
That was a better one.

731
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:13.600
All right,
I had to make up for that.
All right.
Dollar Shave Club,

732
00:43:13.601 --> 00:43:15.690
stamps.com is what I have left.
But let me go to the,

733
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.860
let me go to your questions for the week,
ladies and gentlemen,

734
00:43:18.861 --> 00:43:23.840
the questions of the week.
Um,
okay.
Here we go.

735
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:28.100
Uh,
bike race accident.
Dear Bill,

736
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.590
did you see the video going around this weekend of uh,

737
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.470
of the Brooklyn bike race pile up?
No,
I didn't.
Uh,

738
00:43:34.471 --> 00:43:38.810
it really makes you question the hive mentality of those bikers.

739
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.010
I've been involved in some high speed activities and their inability to stop or

740
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:45.680
slow down properly,
properly is mindblowing.

741
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.610
Give it a Google come down to San Diego once in awhile.
Um,

742
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.410
no I haven't seen that,
but uh,

743
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.180
I do know that people on a regular basis fucking die.

744
00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.240
Um,
not on a regular basis,
but she definitely diamonds.
Yeah.

745
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.960
The how fast those fucking guys goes.
Yeah.

746
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:05.770
You're riding a motorcycle without an engine and

747
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:11.390
Oh,
you got those fucking little shorts on,
get that road rash.

748
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:15.350
It's the exact same thing.
It minus the muffler burn.
Uh,
but I actually,

749
00:44:15.351 --> 00:44:16.760
I'm a big fan of bike racing though.

750
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.880
I always used to watch the Tour de France and I love watching lance when fucking

751
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:24.320
seven in a row,
which he did.
He wants seven in a Ralph.
Okay.

752
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.830
Everybody from him all the way to the back of the race tested positive.

753
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.440
So I'll never,
I'll never give up those seven.

754
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.370
I'll always say he wanted those fucking thanks.

755
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.200
And I gotta tell you something right now.

756
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.640
I haven't watched it since then because it's been boring without,
you know,

757
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:43.290
it's like tiger woods ever since his wife fucking flipped out on him,

758
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:46.440
you know,
and took half his money.
That fucking guy hasn't won shit.

759
00:44:46.441 --> 00:44:51.270
And I never watch golf.
I do like Phil Mickelson though.
I like watching that guy,

760
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:55.290
that guy.
He's like a,
the guy fucking goes 40 doesn't give a shit.
He's like,

761
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.970
you know,
you're buying a tree.
I don't give a fuck.

762
00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:01.710
I'm going to slice right around this thing.
I'm going for the pin.
Uh,
I dunno.

763
00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:04.950
Maybe you should lay up.
Hey,
look at all this sweat.
I got into my man tits.

764
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:07.950
You think I'm laying up?
I'm already ready for a fucking Arnold Palmer.

765
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.580
I'm going for the pin.
It's what he does every time.
All right.
Drum workout.

766
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.121
Hey sir,

767
00:45:12.121 --> 00:45:16.380
billion big fan of the podcast and thought I'd share this with you because I

768
00:45:16.381 --> 00:45:20.970
know how much you love drums and talking about working out.
Um,
oh yeah,

769
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:25.800
recently.
Uh,
I,
I don't know how I,
I I missed out on pan tear.

770
00:45:25.801 --> 00:45:30.510
I just,
you know,
I could never get into that fucking type of singing.

771
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.330
You know what I mean?
He's like,
Jesus Christ,
I heard this in my house growing up.

772
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:36.300
I don't want music used to take me away from this shit,

773
00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:41.301
but just undeniably Vinnie Paul is one of the great rock drummers of all time

774
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:44.010
without a fucking doubt.
And I don't think he gets the credit.

775
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.700
I was talking to my drum teacher about this where he's a lot like Alex van
Halen,

776
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:49.560
who's another one of the great drummers of all time,

777
00:45:49.561 --> 00:45:53.310
but both of them like Alex never got is do I feel because it,
Eddie,

778
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:56.880
Eddie was just so fucking insane that everybody focused on him and they didn't

779
00:45:56.881 --> 00:46:01.140
really even notice how great Alex was.
And I feel like Pantera is the same thing.

780
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.790
It's kind of creepy how like they both have brothers,
like,
you know,

781
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.530
there were innovated,
innovative,
you know,
dime bag.
He should,
cab was just,

782
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.430
there was nobody liked either one of those guitar players.
In fact.

783
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:18.870
And then you are asked as fuck to bring that full circle is unfortunately when

784
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.850
Dimebag was murdered,
um,

785
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.590
I always heard that Eddie donated one of his key loved Eddie van Halen and Eddie

786
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.330
donated one of his guitars.
Um,

787
00:46:28.331 --> 00:46:31.470
I think it was that black and yellow one and they actually buried it with

788
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:35.270
Dimebag.
So,
uh,
I know it's kind of a morbid way to go around and said,
Vinnie,

789
00:46:35.271 --> 00:46:38.310
Paul is a fucking amazing drummer.
But,
um,
I started listening to that song,

790
00:46:38.311 --> 00:46:43.080
I'm broken and uh,
you know,

791
00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:45.570
it's fucking killing me that I can't just sit down and try to figure that

792
00:46:45.571 --> 00:46:48.420
fucking song out.
Cause I,
you know,
I got to sit in this fucking writer's room.

793
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:51.270
I'm really winded about the writer's room.
You know,

794
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.170
cause I'm used to just fucking half of my days to myself to just sit around,

795
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:58.770
you know,
staring at my dry me undies balls.
Um,
all right.
Drum workout.

796
00:46:58.771 --> 00:47:03.771
So this new workout saw this new workout where you pretend to play the drums,

797
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.630
which is currently available in the La area.
See the video link.

798
00:47:09.631 --> 00:47:13.710
Wanted to hear your thoughts.
Comment on these modern gym classes these days.

799
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.680
Time to start soundproofing that garage gym.

800
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.440
Thanks for La for the last and go fuck yourself.
Well,

801
00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:24.441
why would I don't understand like guitar hero or even lie having looked at this

802
00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:29.070
fucking workout class.
Like why wouldn't you just learn how to play drums?

803
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.110
Oh,
they're not pretending to play drums.
They have sticks.
Oh God.

804
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:36.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

805
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:39.080
<v 1>This is going to be white people trying to be tribal.</v>

806
00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.460
Oh yeah.
It's sort of aerobics

807
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.890
and then just playing beats with sticks and stuff.

808
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:53.790
Oh my God.
This,
Oh,
this has given me Deuce chills.

809
00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.900
Ah.
They're like,
oh God.

810
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:05.860
And they always has to be the person wearing the hat inside the knitted hat.

811
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.040
<v 3>Ah,</v>

812
00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.440
<v 1>just when you thought that awful look went away.</v>

813
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.770
You know the guy with the fucking skinny jeans,

814
00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:18.110
a tee shirt and then like I'm going to have a snowball fight hat on.

815
00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:24.220
I'm pretending to play the drums is now a hot new workout.

816
00:48:24.771 --> 00:48:26.240
Well they weren't really pretending.

817
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:30.410
They were actually hitting the floor with them and stuff and hitting the sticks.

818
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:35.120
So he said there was already a dance from form in India called

819
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.440
<v 3>okay.</v>

820
00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.440
<v 1>Danya Danya which has the same concept of dancing was sticks and a thousand plus</v>

821
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.760
years old tradition.
Oh,
what a surprise.
What a surprise.

822
00:48:46.761 --> 00:48:50.020
Did somebody already come up with a lot of gifts that gets people in shape?

823
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:52.650
It actually kind of looks like fun,
but I,
my ears couldn't handle,

824
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:57.500
I'd have to have fucking earplugs in.
I Dunno.

825
00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:00.590
But everyone was making those guitar hero rocket rocking out faces.

826
00:49:00.591 --> 00:49:03.790
But what would be cool is if that actually,
you know,

827
00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:06.350
if you're taking one of those classes and you actually want to learn how to play

828
00:49:06.351 --> 00:49:09.140
drums,
but you know,
you can't really play because you have an apartment.

829
00:49:09.141 --> 00:49:13.910
I cannot recommend those Rolling v drums enough.
They're fucking amazing.

830
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.750
And uh,

831
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:19.750
I told you when I had to two of those kits when I was in New York,

832
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.880
it's kind of weird because it's like a computer,

833
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:27.320
like it gets old and then the new one's better than you,
like because they don't,

834
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.870
if it was an acoustic,
like a regular drum kit,

835
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.570
you just keep it from the fucking drums.

836
00:49:32.571 --> 00:49:35.180
But they get the new brains and they're better and a,
and I don't know,

837
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.960
you just keep,
you just keep,
I don't know.
It's a lot of fucking money,

838
00:49:38.961 --> 00:49:40.700
but they're fucking awesome.
So if you live,

839
00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.860
if you live like the way I did what I had a neighbor underneath me,

840
00:49:42.861 --> 00:49:45.230
I went downstairs and I knocked on the guy's door and I said,
listen,

841
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:50.990
I practice drums.
Uh,
when do you work?
I'll only practice during those hours.

842
00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:54.530
If you're ever home.
When I'm practicing,
here's my phone number.

843
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.670
Call me the second I pick up,
you tell me to stop.
I will immediately stop.
And we,

844
00:49:58.671 --> 00:50:02.710
uh,
we actually still had a problem because the first time he heard me play,
he,

845
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:05.300
I've said hello.
He goes,
can you knock it off?

846
00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.200
And I just fucking snapped on the guy.
I was like,
dude,
don't fucking say that.

847
00:50:09.201 --> 00:50:11.510
Like he asked me 12 fucking times.
It did all that shit.

848
00:50:11.511 --> 00:50:15.620
And then he never called me again.
Fucking dickhead.
Although,
you know,

849
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.030
in defense of him,
I can't imagine what that sounded like underneath,
you know,

850
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:25.070
not Jesus.
I'm just fucking,
I'm just,
just for attracting every fucking statement.

851
00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.240
Alright.
Shoot matches.
Dear Billy bangers and Mash,

852
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:33.320
you were talking about shoot,
mashes,
shoot matches on this Thursday's podcast.

853
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:34.880
For those of you who didn't listen,
uh,

854
00:50:34.881 --> 00:50:38.510
shoot match is a wrestling term where basically,
you know,

855
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:40.130
the sports entertainment,
you know,

856
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.070
it's a fake fight even though they really hurting each other,
but you know,

857
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.800
it's worked out.
It's sports entertainment.

858
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:50.030
So technically it's fake even though they're really throwing each other and

859
00:50:50.031 --> 00:50:52.910
getting hurt,
it is fake.
Um,

860
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:57.350
what happens in a shoot matches somebody's fucking snaps and becomes a real

861
00:50:57.351 --> 00:51:01.760
fight and starts beating the shit out of the person for real.
So,

862
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.720
um,
he said if you're into those shoot matches,

863
00:51:05.721 --> 00:51:08.480
you should definitely look up a wrestler name New Jack.

864
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:13.580
The psycho was known for frequently shooting on other wrestlers for the most

865
00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:14.420
minor things.

866
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:19.420
In one case he thought a tag team was trying to steal his gangsta image.

867
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.090
So he hit them with chairs,
full force,

868
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:27.730
stabbed them in the head with forks,
et cetera.
And another match.

869
00:51:27.731 --> 00:51:31.070
He basically tries to murder a 60 something year old man.

870
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:34.970
Those matches are brutal as fuck man.
You should check them out.

871
00:51:34.971 --> 00:51:39.320
I actually saw those.
Yeah,
that guy has like psychological damages,

872
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.170
damages,
psychological damage.
Um,

873
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:47.120
I knew a guy like that when I was growing up.
He went to fucking cop school.

874
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:52.700
Surprise,
surprise.
You know,
fucking maniacs who like to be violent.

875
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:55.520
Like they always end up somehow being bouncers and cops.

876
00:51:55.521 --> 00:52:00.050
I'm not saying they're all like that.
I'm just saying,
it's like,
you know,

877
00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.630
people that want to fuck kids,
you know,

878
00:52:02.631 --> 00:52:05.690
they're all about volunteering to take them out into the woods.

879
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.640
Not saying every cub scout master as well.
I'm just saying,
you know,

880
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:15.710
people who want to beat the fuck out of people in don't want to go to jail,

881
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:19.070
get jobs where they have the afford 30 to beat the fuck out of somebody.

882
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:20.480
So this fucking lunatic.

883
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:25.490
So he comes back from like his weekend at cop school and um,

884
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.190
I don't know what he did and he never got accepted.
They just were like,

885
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:31.310
try out thing.
I don't know.
I came on was so fucking long ago,

886
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.320
so he wants to show me this move.

887
00:52:33.321 --> 00:52:36.410
Then he learned and he was doing it in slow motion.

888
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:40.700
And then I remember he just fucking looked up at the ceiling,
you know?

889
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:44.750
Do you remember how like,
uh,
that dude and full metal jacket when he's like,

890
00:52:44.751 --> 00:52:49.751
I am in a world of Shit private joke here,

891
00:52:51.511 --> 00:52:53.230
you know that that thing,
right?
He,

892
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:57.980
he fucking looked up like that and just fucking full force.
Did the move.

893
00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.600
And I heard my fucking wrist snap and um,

894
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:05.450
I forget how many times I punched him in the side of the head.

895
00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.480
I was so fucking mad at him and I was really just mad at myself because I knew

896
00:53:12.711 --> 00:53:15.830
that he was one of those guys,
like he just fucking like,

897
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.420
like he was one of those key was one to let the exact type of personality that

898
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:25.250
you do not teach that type of shit too because just

899
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:27.780
he was a dope.

900
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:32.040
He never felt like he had power in life and then he had this new move and he

901
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:33.450
just couldn't handle it.
It was like,

902
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:37.170
you know the whole thing when they always talk like a baby poisonous snake is

903
00:53:37.171 --> 00:53:37.590
the worst.

904
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:40.740
It's worse than getting bit by an adult baby snake cause he dealt baby snakes

905
00:53:40.741 --> 00:53:41.610
sorta rations out.

906
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:44.940
The poison with the baby just gives you a fucking both barrels.

907
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:46.230
That's well that's what the fuck he did.

908
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:48.900
He had the mentality of a fucking baby reptiles what I'm saying?

909
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.930
And he fucking jacked up my God damn wrist and um,
hey,

910
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.980
and you know what?
It became a fucking shoot match.

911
00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.050
That was probably his positive.

912
00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:02.070
Show it to me and I just fucking drilled him in the side of the head like

913
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:06.030
fucking six times is hard as I fucking could.

914
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:09.990
I was so fucking mad at him and I remember we were both drunk.

915
00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:11.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

916
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.070
<v 1>A fucking idiot.
God bless him.
Um,
anyways,</v>

917
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:18.510
over the head.
Yeah.
That was a throwback Thursday story.
All right.

918
00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.450
Fight dear Billy boy band Billy boy band.
All right.

919
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:26.050
Everyone's been asked.
Everyone's always asking for advice.

920
00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:30.060
So here's a rhetorical,
uh,
who's,

921
00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:34.930
who wins in a fight to the death between a silver back gorilla and a grizzly

922
00:54:34.931 --> 00:54:38.710
bear.
One's got Iq and Matt upper body.

923
00:54:38.711 --> 00:54:42.580
The other has razor sharp claws and skull crushing jaws.

924
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.680
Uh,
thanks.
Uh,

925
00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:51.730
and go sit on it repeatedly.
And I don't know what that means.

926
00:54:51.731 --> 00:54:54.290
Is that like a happy days for us reference?
Um,

927
00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:56.670
<v 0>yeah,</v>

928
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.070
<v 1>I would say,
uh,</v>

929
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.820
it depends on if it's a hoe.
I'm rooting.

930
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.370
I would go with the home team.
All right.

931
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.800
If it's a home game for the grizzly bear and they're out in an open field and

932
00:55:10.801 --> 00:55:15.801
there's no fucking tree for the gorilla to fucking go up and then come back

933
00:55:15.811 --> 00:55:16.670
down,
go up,
you know,

934
00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:20.790
do that fucking monkey shit where they slap you in the fucking head.
Um,
I would,

935
00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:25.580
I would say the grizzly winds because
you know,

936
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.330
the gorillas can ball up his fist,
but you know,
you're fighting,

937
00:55:29.331 --> 00:55:33.170
it's like you're fighting Freddy Krueger and he's got two gloves for gloves.

938
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.990
Actually I would say.
Um,

939
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.370
I dunno,
and I got to admit like,
I think I think gorillas a chill,

940
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.330
like I don't think they really liked doing that stuff.
And,
um,

941
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:52.480
I've watched him fight other fucking gorillas and,
uh,

942
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.560
you know,

943
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.550
there's a lot of clutching and grabbing and shit and I've watched two gorilla

944
00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.280
grizzly bears go at it and it's fucking devastating.
Where you like,

945
00:56:00.281 --> 00:56:04.480
how was one of them not dead?
So I would say a grizzly bear.

946
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.290
Um,
I dunno,

947
00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:11.500
and I'm sure over in Asia that they have those fights on the weekends

948
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:17.800
somewhere in Asia.
They're doing that right now.
Um,

949
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.450
because when I go on Youtube,
I'm just basing that on,
you know,
where you going?

950
00:56:22.451 --> 00:56:26.670
Youtube is actually black and white footage of like lions fighting tigers and

951
00:56:26.671 --> 00:56:30.450
shit like that and fucking cobras fighting these things and you know,

952
00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:34.920
it's just static alligators first fucking cobras or whatever the fuck they was

953
00:56:34.921 --> 00:56:39.570
just,
you know,
like over and age should like the original MMA,
you know,

954
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:44.480
UFC type of ship was actually animals first.
Animals,
you know,

955
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.300
I mean you got to give it up to him.
I mean,
I know that we,

956
00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:51.830
we asked those questions here over an age of they actually get it done,
you know,

957
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.900
which makes means that they're actually killing it more in the realm of a don't

958
00:56:56.901 --> 00:57:01.810
tell me,
show me they're taking the initiative is all I'm saying.
Um,

959
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.300
all right,
here we go.
We get a couple more here.
All right.

960
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.870
Let me read the last two.
Fucking advertising's really quick.

961
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.540
Advertising's advertisements.
She's just crushed.

962
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:20.140
It's amazing.
They're amazing sometimes that English is my first language.
Uh,

963
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:24.530
by the way,
I'm 64 days in with my French.
I'm learning past tense stuff.

964
00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.390
I can look at it and I can translate it,

965
00:57:26.391 --> 00:57:30.290
but I can't recall it because I have no one to speak it with.
But uh,

966
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.600
I have to think that it's helping me on some level.

967
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.870
I think I'll be able to read a newspaper by the time I get to fucking France the

968
00:57:35.871 --> 00:57:39.590
next time.
I just won't be able to talk to anybody.

Easy shave butter.

992
00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.200
Now it's Dr Carver's shave butter.

993
00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.320

997
00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.600
One of my eyes is on the word I'm reading and the other one is like three words

998
00:59:34.601 --> 00:59:39.480
down.
I don't know what that is.
What is the medical term for that?
Uh,

999
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.990
Lazy.

1021
01:00:55.361 --> 01:00:59.470
stamps.com enter [inaudible] are right here we go.

1022
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.680
And uh,
what do I got here?
I've got the questions.
The last two here.

1023
01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.430
All right,
Tom Brady and Jim or say,
alright,

1024
01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:12.520
even I'm sick of this fucking story at this point.
What about Billy boy?

1025
01:01:12.521 --> 01:01:14.500
Big Fatty of by Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1026
01:01:14.501 --> 01:01:19.240
Of course the pats didn't beat the colts by 34 because of a deflated ball,

1027
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.990
deflated balls.
That's not the point though.
Here's an example.

1028
01:01:22.991 --> 01:01:27.991
If a baseball player is on steroid but goes oh for five on a particular day,

1029
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:32.200
what do you mean?
That's not the point though.
I don't know what point you made.

1030
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.823
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1031
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:39.310
<v 1>I guess you're saying the deflated ball didn't affect the outcome,
uh,</v>

1032
01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.520
for baseball player is on steroids but goes oh for five on a particular day.

1033
01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:48.290
Does that mean he didn't cheat?
Of course not.
I hate people who do this.

1034
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.110
Who Asks questions for me.
Uh,

1035
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:53.900
the point I'm making is that it's not about the results.

1036
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:57.890
It's about breaking the rules.
See this is why I can't stand people.

1037
01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.660
That's now,
this is not what that decision was about Tom Brady's was,

1038
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.990
was his suspension was reinstated.

1039
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:08.660
Not because it was proven that he cheated.

1040
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:09.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1041
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.910
<v 1>This last trial was all about does it corporation have a right to discipline?</v>

1042
01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:19.070
It's employee.
That's what it was about.

1043
01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.640
That's what the NFL was fighting.
Cause Tom Brady opened up a can of worms,

1044
01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:29.140
which was basically like where your boss and we said you're suspended.

1045
01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:33.760
He appealed it outside of the NFL into a court of law,

1046
01:02:33.761 --> 01:02:38.410
which of course it didn't fucking hold up cause it was a complete kangaroo court

1047
01:02:38.411 --> 01:02:40.120
horse shit fucking thing that happened.

1048
01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:45.730
You know where the owner of the other fucking team hires a guy to find dirt on

1049
01:02:45.731 --> 01:02:49.030
the other fucking team,
which you can do on anybody.
Right?

1050
01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:52.300
And then then one guy plays judge,
jury and execution.

1051
01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.160
You take it into a court of law.

1052
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:56.830
I knew that thing would get laughed out of court.
What should fucking did?

1053
01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.550
And Jim Irsay was looked to be a fucking moron.
So then what happened,
sir,

1054
01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:05.710
is they changed their argument.
They then went back to say,
listen,

1055
01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:09.970
we are the NFL,
the corporation known as the national football league.

1056
01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.190
Tom Brady is an employee.
All right?
We said that he's suspended.

1057
01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.600
We are his boss.
Do we?
Well,
we,

1058
01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:22.540
we argue that we have the right to suspend.

1059
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:23.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1060
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:26.710
<v 1>Um,
our own employees.
That's what it was about.</v>

1061
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:28.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1062
01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:31.670
<v 1>Okay.
So this is what kills me about all these people,</v>

1063
01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:35.420
including Michael [inaudible],
Michael Rappaport who texted me,

1064
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:41.530
right?
He fucking texted me and he goes,
ha ha,
motherfucker.
Uh,

1065
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.890
guilty until proven innocent.
Like,
like Tom Brady was racist.

1066
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.860
Like the suspension was reactivated,

1067
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.100
thus vindicating everybody that says,
Tom Brady's a cheat.

1068
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:55.370
You guys are not paying attention to the fucking story.
That's not what happened.

1069
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.600
What happened was the NFL in a court of law one,

1070
01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:04.490
the right to suspend Tom Brady because Tom Brady is a fucking,
oh God.

1071
01:04:04.491 --> 01:04:07.340
Is there anything more relentless than when your fucking wife calls Jesus
Christ?

1072
01:04:07.341 --> 01:04:11.870
I got two more minutes here.
Um,
all right,
I'll answer it here.

1073
01:04:11.871 --> 01:04:16.520
Hang on a second.
I'll answer it.
Hello.

1074
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:20.960
Hello.
It's connecting.
Hey,
I'm finishing my podcast.

1075
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.420
That's why I have a microphone and headphones on.

1076
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.150
I'll try to acquire it back QUT by,
um,

1077
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:32.360
anyways,
that's what happens.
So I'll read the rest of this guy.
Shit.

1078
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:37.130
Most buffalo wild wing dopes.
Think what happened was they,
uh,

1079
01:04:37.131 --> 01:04:41.270
the NFL appealed it and it got proven that Tom Brady is in fact the cheater.

1080
01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.350
That that was never proven.
It was never proven.
All right.

1081
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.710
So I don't know what,
so he goes,
if Brady broke the rule,

1082
01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.180
then he should be punished.

1083
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.290
I don't know if he did or he did and I'm just tired of the argument that sends

1084
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:58.490
pads.
The pads blew out the colts.
It doesn't matter.
Another thing,

1085
01:04:58.491 --> 01:05:02.540
you always say that the colts owner got rules changed to benefit his teams.

1086
01:05:02.541 --> 01:05:04.700
What rules were changed?
As far as I know,

1087
01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.240
he only asks that the League enforce rules that were already in place.

1088
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:09.940
Now we sat on the rules committee.

1089
01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:12.280
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1090
01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.530
<v 1>When we beat him and we roughed up as receivers,</v>

1091
01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:18.310
he bitched to the referees and the referee said that's illegal.

1092
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.520
He then made a tape,
he and a and Peyton Manning,
he made a tape,

1093
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:23.860
went to the NFL and the NFL said,
that's legal.

1094
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:25.780
Jim Mercy got on the rules committee.

1095
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.400
He spearheaded a movement to make the way we covered their receivers,
not legal.

1096
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:35.030
Okay.
The cold set up better off fence than we did at the time.

1097
01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:39.110
We had a better defense.
He made a rule change that tipped it in favor of him.

1098
01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:42.860
This guy is fucking filthy.
He's fucking filthy.

1099
01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.920
Those walls were changed and why do I have to tell you that?

1100
01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:49.640
Why don't you fucking look it up like you can't find it anyways.
He goes,

1101
01:05:49.641 --> 01:05:52.520
as far as I know,
he only asked for the no.
Yeah.
As far as you know.
Yeah,

1102
01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:53.600
because you didn't look it up.

1103
01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:58.100
The five yard rule for receivers has been around forever.
No,
it hasn't.

1104
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.480
No,
it hasn't.
That happened in my lifetime.

1105
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.960
The first thing it was,
it was the Mel Blount rule.

1106
01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:09.460
When he beat the shit out of Golden Richards in the Superbowl.
Don't fuck.

1107
01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:12.020
Are you speaking in general?
Hourlies I can't fucking say.

1108
01:06:12.021 --> 01:06:15.620
I can't stand people like this.
Oh.
And it's been around forever.
Oh,

1109
01:06:15.621 --> 01:06:19.040
this global blue.
Ooh.
They don't even look it up.

1110
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:23.290
That's like Versie when VRC fucking goes like,
uh,
you know,

1111
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.910
Joe Montana had Jerry Rice.

1112
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.130
It's like he didn't have him for his first two super bowls.

1113
01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:33.260
He had nobody in 81 he had Freddy Solomon and Dwight Clark.

1114
01:06:33.261 --> 01:06:35.930
Those were his number one and two receivers.
And he had some guy,

1115
01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.960
Earl Cooper is a fucking running back.
He won with nobody.

1116
01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.850
He won with people he wanted was stars wounded people.
He won't stars,
right?

1117
01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.910
It's fucking millennials.
I don't understand them.
Wherever it pre millennials,

1118
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:51.470
they just don't look at anything he said Earth or say simply wanted it enforced.

1119
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:55.880
What's wrong with that?
Please respond on your podcast.
Even if you shit on me,

1120
01:06:55.881 --> 01:06:58.370
I'll remain a listen or you're a funny motherfucker.
Dude.

1121
01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:03.110
That's not what fucking happened and all of this shit happened in your lifetime.

1122
01:07:03.111 --> 01:07:05.030
You're just having selective memory.

1123
01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:13.330
He fucking,
he said to the referees,
look at this tape.

1124
01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:16.000
Look what they did.
They go,
yeah,
we saw it.
That's legal.

1125
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:18.760
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1126
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.690
<v 1>unreal.
Unreal.
And then they made the tape.
How do you forget this shit?
There was,</v>

1127
01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:24.970
it was like a little over 10 years ago.
Go look it up.

1128
01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:27.970
That's what the fuck happened.
And then it became,

1129
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:32.290
then it became,
you can't touch him at all.

1130
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:36.580
It wasn't after five yards.
It wasn't before the five yards.

1131
01:07:36.581 --> 01:07:38.170
They were touching moves after them.

1132
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.730
The physical contact that they were having after that that they were bitching

1133
01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:45.670
about,
and then that's when it came.
Okay,

1134
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.440
you can do the five yard chuck and then after that bullshit you can't touch

1135
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.680
anybody at all.
Used to be able to hand check.
I'm not saying like,

1136
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:57.670
you know that you know,
10 years ago you could fucking beat the shit out of me.

1137
01:07:57.671 --> 01:07:58.301
I'm not saying that,

1138
01:07:58.301 --> 01:08:03.301
but it's gradually kept moving towards what Jim Irsay finally had was like,

1139
01:08:04.421 --> 01:08:07.810
okay,
you can push the guy,
you know,

1140
01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:11.050
in the first five yards and then this is the gym or the gym or say ruled the

1141
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:14.200
isn't.
Then after that you can't do anything.

1142
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.400
Okay.
Which is why right after that,

1143
01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:22.450
all of a sudden all of Dan Marino's records started falling right and left.

1144
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:26.110
I remember one year there was like drew Brees,
drew Brees,
Peyton Manning,

1145
01:08:26.111 --> 01:08:30.730
and like fucking Tom Brady were all on pace to break his like almost 30 year old

1146
01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:33.790
record of yards in a season.
MMM,

1147
01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:35.260
<v 0>okay.</v>

1148
01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:35.921
<v 1>Because of those,</v>

1149
01:08:35.921 --> 01:08:39.490
those ridiculous things that we became almost illegal to cover or receiver.

1150
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:43.870
It was never like that when I was growing up ever.
And if you don't believe me,

1151
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:47.920
do your homework,
go look,
go look at old NFL footage.

1152
01:08:47.921 --> 01:08:49.030
The shit that you could do,

1153
01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.120
the NBA is the same fucking way you could beat the shit out of somebody if they

1154
01:08:52.121 --> 01:08:56.110
came down the fucking lane.
I mean,
what Kevin Mchale did,
the Kurt Rambis,

1155
01:08:56.111 --> 01:08:59.930
I mean back in the day.
Okay.
That would be like a 10 game suspension,
um,

1156
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.380
or whatever it would be.
You'd be suspended for a number of games in it.

1157
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:06.990
And then as far as I know,
nobody even got thrown out.
Uh,

1158
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:09.460
but I am going back like 30 years,
so please just,

1159
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:12.410
I don't give a fuck if you want to shit on my team,
but just do your homework.

1160
01:09:12.411 --> 01:09:16.130
That last trial was about a corporation's right to suspend an employee.

1161
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.570
That's what it was about.
It wasn't about whether Tom Brady was guilty.
And,
uh,

1162
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:23.810
and for all you can see out there who are just obsessed with this air pressure.

1163
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.590
What if Tom Brady had fucking steroids delivered to his fucking mailbox in his

1164
01:09:27.591 --> 01:09:30.950
wife's name?
Give me a fucking break already.
And even then,

1165
01:09:30.951 --> 01:09:31.790
I gotta be honest with you,

1166
01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:35.360
I don't think steroids change the outcome of the game.

1167
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:40.190
They help your personal performance.
But if steroids just met you won the game,

1168
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.690
then you know,
teams that did steroids,
they're they,
but they,

1169
01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:47.920
when they just go undefeated,
I dunno,

1170
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:52.390
it gives you a competitive edge.
It does.
And you know,
whatever,
I,

1171
01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.170
I am not against steroids.
I think steroids should be fucking legalized.

1172
01:09:56.390 --> 01:10:00.410
They should be researched to the hilt and,
um,

1173
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:06.200
just literally for the quality of life,
then everyone's going to have like know,

1174
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.770
I mean,
singers blow out their voices,

1175
01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:11.120
they get to take a steroid and they go out and sing their fucking song.

1176
01:10:11.121 --> 01:10:13.830
They'll be in the crowd says that they cheated.
Right.

1177
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:15.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1178
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:20.310
<v 1>I Dunno.
Anyways,
let's plow ahead.
Whatever.
I'm,
I'm fucking,</v>

1179
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.050
I'm done arguing that,

1180
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:25.290
especially at this point when all of that information that I just said is out

1181
01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:27.300
there.
I might've had a couple of things wrong,

1182
01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:30.120
cause I don't have literally the documents in front of me,

1183
01:10:30.121 --> 01:10:34.020
but basically what I'm saying is true and I just don't want to argue this shit

1184
01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:35.550
anymore.
Okay.
No matter what,

1185
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:38.370
this guy's going to get suspended because at the end of the day,

1186
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.260
he works for this fucking corporation.

1187
01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:42.930
And you know what the NFL is actually right.

1188
01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:47.020
I think they're wrong to suspend Tom Brady.
I think that the,

1189
01:10:47.021 --> 01:10:50.250
the investigation and all of that was an absolute fucking witch hunt.

1190
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.720
I think all of that is bullshit.

1191
01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:55.770
But I do think that the NFL is a corporation has to maintain the right to

1192
01:10:55.771 --> 01:10:59.880
suspend somebody.
So if the bus has to roll over Tom Brady,
then so be it.

1193
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.660
Cause it's gonna make for a better league because if he gets away with this,

1194
01:11:03.661 --> 01:11:06.720
then everybody is going to appeal it outside of the NFL and then they lose

1195
01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:10.980
control.
And a,
as much as I'm not a fan of monopolies,
as a sports fan,

1196
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:15.760
it works out great.
Like the UFC is to shit because the fighters have no options.

1197
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:17.140
I feel bad for those guys,

1198
01:11:17.141 --> 01:11:20.980
but it's great for me as a fight fan because the best guys have to fight the

1199
01:11:20.981 --> 01:11:24.310
best guys.
Um,
all right.
Advice.

1200
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.360
I smell.
All right.
I have a car.

1201
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:32.440
I have a crippling health issues since I was a kid.
I fucking stink.

1202
01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.570
People tell me I smell moldy.

1203
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:39.670
No doctor knows why Colona deodorants can't mask it.
Oh my God.
He goes,

1204
01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:44.350
the odor actually gets stronger when I use those things.
Showering doesn't help.

1205
01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:48.370
So I am left alone with this issue.

1206
01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:52.090
I'm trying to eat as healthy as possible and exercise every day,

1207
01:11:52.091 --> 01:11:56.170
which seems to reduce the problem by 50%,

1208
01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.610
which sounds like a lot,
but still doesn't satisfy me.

1209
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:04.000
I think it's a metabolic issue,
which I don't even know what that is.

1210
01:12:04.001 --> 01:12:06.880
And the body is trying to get rid of the toxins through the skin.

1211
01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:08.770
Not sure though,
either way.

1212
01:12:08.771 --> 01:12:13.180
My whole life revolves around this shit and it led me through episodes of

1213
01:12:13.181 --> 01:12:17.650
depression as a teenager and I even considered throwing myself off a bridge or

1214
01:12:17.651 --> 01:12:22.010
in front of one of those great white trains.
Uh,

1215
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:23.440
US Germans are making,

1216
01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.370
but life is actually decent despite this issue.

1217
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.970
I can't attend any college classes because of the anxiety,

1218
01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.620
but I have a great amount of friends.
I'm happy,
funny.
All right.

1219
01:12:34.621 --> 01:12:39.370
Looking Guy and my game is,
all right.
So I still get my dick wet.
Sometimes gross.

1220
01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:43.330
Can't lock down any girl though for obvious reasons.

1221
01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:45.250
I don't even know why I wrote all of this,

1222
01:12:45.251 --> 01:12:50.110
but I just wanted to tell you that this podcast and your comedy are really

1223
01:12:50.111 --> 01:12:53.200
stimulating.
My Butt's thinking brain.

1224
01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:56.970
Please come to Jeremy so we can see your show and I can harass you knows.

1225
01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.800
Thanks for reading and go fuck yourself and your dog.
Just kidding.

1226
01:12:59.801 --> 01:13:04.210
I like your dog.
Just go fuck yourself.
I'm all right,
dude.
Um,

1227
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:09.280
I would just keep going to doctors.
They,
I bet they could figure something out.

1228
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.060
You know,
it's gotta be some new agey type of thing,

1229
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:17.050
some sort of detox.
If it's your body getting rid of a toxic,

1230
01:13:17.051 --> 01:13:21.220
maybe you're allergic to something.
I have no idea.
I am not,

1231
01:13:21.221 --> 01:13:25.520
obviously not a doctor here,
but yeah,
detox,

1232
01:13:25.521 --> 01:13:30.140
fasting,
changing your diet.
Um,

1233
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.220
there's gotta be,
there's gotta be a way to do that.
I remember a long time ago,

1234
01:13:36.221 --> 01:13:40.390
there was some woman that just had,
was talking about she had brutal Halitosis,

1235
01:13:40.391 --> 01:13:45.000
which is a,
you know,
your breads fucking stinks.
It was fucking brutal.
And um,

1236
01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.580
it turned out she had some sort of sinus infection and then once they cleared

1237
01:13:48.581 --> 01:13:49.720
that up for fucking

1238
01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.120
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1239
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.310
<v 1>Or breath was fine.
So I bet you have</v>

1240
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.890
<v 3>okay.</v>

1241
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:58.130
<v 1>This I,
you know,
if I had to guess there's something undiagnosed,</v>

1242
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.450
you know Helfgott I'm so in over my head.

1243
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.210
You got something maybe that you have some sort of fucking infection.

1244
01:14:05.211 --> 01:14:09.040
I have no fucking idea and I bet you know there's gotta be something that does

1245
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:12.530
it for free.
If somebody can take a nap and drive to work and not kill anybody,

1246
01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:14.440
they got to figure out why your moldy.

1247
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:17.660
I would just keep going to specialists and I,

1248
01:14:17.661 --> 01:14:20.930
if you guys have nationwide healthcare over there,
I would just,

1249
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:22.280
that would be my new hobby.

1250
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.020
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1251
01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:24.853
<v 1>You know,</v>

1252
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:27.980
and just keep adding to your file and somebody comes in and somebody will

1253
01:14:27.981 --> 01:14:30.920
finally crack the fucking case as to why you smelled moldy.

1254
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.170
I bet they can figure it out.
You know,

1255
01:14:33.171 --> 01:14:36.230
and then we'll would be great is you went to the alienation of this.

1256
01:14:36.231 --> 01:14:41.231
See you got the sense of humor that comes from feeling alienated and um,

1257
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:47.360
I your life will be a fucking joke after that.
I mean,
think about it too.

1258
01:14:47.361 --> 01:14:49.100
If you could just stop smelling moldy,

1259
01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:52.190
I would think that that's the number one thing.
And then you'd be happy.

1260
01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.490
You thought your life would be at fucking joke.

1261
01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.790
So if you have nationwide healthcare,

1262
01:14:57.830 --> 01:15:01.760
I would be seeing a doctor like fucking every couple of days.
All right buddy.

1263
01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.150
It's like you're pulling people out of the crowd.
They hit the half court shot.

1264
01:15:05.151 --> 01:15:08.720
Eventually.
It's the,
the ball's going to go in,
I believe in June.
It's few.

1265
01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:13.460
It's fucking Germany.
You guys got it.
You guys are fucking,
you know,

1266
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.530
half our space program we stole from you guys.
The whole seeds of it.

1267
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:22.460
Audio tape,
all that shit.
You guys had better machine guns that we did.

1268
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.700
Ours would overheat.
Sophie killed you.
We actually pit,

1269
01:15:25.701 --> 01:15:28.670
we dropped our guns and picked up your machine.
Guns is no fucking way.

1270
01:15:28.671 --> 01:15:32.450
In 2016 they can't figure out why you're moldy.
I feel bad for you,
man.

1271
01:15:32.451 --> 01:15:33.320
I'm rooting for you,

1272
01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:37.030
and I hope you figure it out before you come out to my shelf.
And A,

1273
01:15:37.031 --> 01:15:40.520
I should probably know the answer if they didn't,
you know?
All right,

1274
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.470
go fuck yourselves.
Uh,
I have a great week and I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1275
01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:46.000
See you.
