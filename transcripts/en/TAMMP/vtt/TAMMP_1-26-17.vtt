00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.740
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn is time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:08.030
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Dan,

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.380
just checking in on you.
Just check it on your own little baby cry in the end.

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.060
My beautiful daughter is home now and uh,
she's downstairs sleeping,

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.450
so I'm gonna try to knock this out while a while.

6
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.780
She's still asleep before she wakes up in like 18 seconds,

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.990
which has been the thing hasn't been so bad.
All these parents,

8
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.600
all you were to go to home or a big goober day,
right?

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.180
I ran into parents tonight and I'm going,
no,
you know it's not that bad.

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.350
I'm a little sleepy,
but you know,

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.200
I'm hanging in there and then you know what they said?

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.470
Oh wait til she starts walking.
I just want to be like,

13
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:48.471
are you enjoying any aspect of this that I swear to God did gloom and like,

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.150
you know what parents are like,
it's like reading a Dan Shaughnessy sports call.

15
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.240
Just,
there's no light at the end of the tunnel.
Even if there is light,

16
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.490
but it's going to blind your eyes.
Good Lord.

17
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.870
Good Lord.

18
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.440
I understand why kids run away from home just talking to all these fucking

19
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:13.220
parents,
man,
I just,
I swear to God I am.
I'm like,

20
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.380
I'm loving people that don't have kids right now.
They had a kid,
oh good for you.

21
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:21.860
Good for you.
That's great man.
Good you gotta you gotta be bright dead.
That's it.

22
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.610
These other fucking people,
I swear to God,
half these parents,
you know what?

23
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.850
They ought to stick them on the weather channel.
You know,

24
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:30.530
cause you know that that's how the weather channel,

25
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.790
that's how they make their money.

26
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.610
Like nobody pays attention when it's a beautiful day,
but oh my God,

27
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.940
if there's a storm coming,
you know,
they just start freaking out.

28
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:41.420
Getting everybody running out to the grocery store to bite nine weeks of eggs

29
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:45.200
because it's going to rain for an afternoon or maybe it's going to snow.

30
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.580
We're going to get 18 inches.
Holy Shit.
That's almost up to my knees.

31
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.000
What am I going to do?
You're going to be fine.
You're going to,

32
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.760
what was the last fucking time?
A whole town,

33
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:05.020
God so snowed in that everybody just died of starvation.

34
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:07.210
Has that ever happened in the United States.

35
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:09.670
I'm not saying a couple of fucking people haven't died.

36
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.830
There's always the person sitting in the car and the fucking snow comes up and

37
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:16.360
then the,
the,
the,
the carbon monoxide goes in.

38
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.830
They'll always be some old lady sitting too close to the window and she'll die.

39
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.570
Right.
Cause it's snowed out.
Oh.
Because she was born,
you know,

40
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:28.840
three years after the civil war.
I mean,
you make the call on that one.

41
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.900
Jesus fucking Christ,

42
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.420
he's God damn parents said they just stay fucking scare in the shit out of you.

43
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.500
So I don't know what's going on in the world.
Um,
in a good way.

44
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.990
Um,
I'm having the best time ever been a dad.
I've always wanted to be a dad,

45
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:46.160
so I'm enjoying the hell out of it.

46
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:50.180
And I don't care if I'm fucking tired and I feel like I'm drunk,
you know,

47
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:52.640
I don't want to miss a second of this thing,
so,
uh,

48
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.180
I'm going to stop talking to the parents.
Goddamn Weirdos.

49
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.070
I just don't get them.
It's like,

50
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.330
what did you think was going to happen when you had a baby?
What?

51
00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:06.250
What did you think was going to happen?
You know,
it was a baby.

52
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.410
You knew it wouldn't understand English.

53
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.690
Did you read up on it at all?
You,
everybody's,
you know what they sound like?

54
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:18.280
They sound like they sound like some people who like bought like a swamp land

55
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.750
and were promised that it was a paradise or something.
I mean,
I don't know.

56
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.590
I don't fucking know,
but I'm,
I'm not going to be that guy.

57
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.410
If I meet somebody else who's having a kid,
even if I have a tough day,

58
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.060
I'm going to say,
hey,
good for you.
If that's great,
man,

59
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:33.070
it's going to be a great thing.
Good for you.

60
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.350
Instead of putting all this fucking gloom and doom and everybody's head anyways,

61
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.370
anybody watched the,
uh,
the Celtics supplies?
Couple of games,
man,

62
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.970
I got to love the fact that the fucking,

63
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.950
the Celtics and the wizards have this rivalry now.
You know what I mean?

64
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.950
Everybody's talking about the calves and the,
and the,

65
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:55.000
and the Golden State Warriors.
Hey,
we are dead tier two or tier three.

66
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.350
I love other wizards were all black.
It's going to be a funeral.

67
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.780
And she just fucking put your sneakers on,
pump up your little Reebok's,

68
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.790
whatever.
The fucking just go and go play basketball.

69
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.810
We're all dressed all in black or what does that mean you're going to try

70
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:12.814
tonight?

71
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.000
The other nights when he just wear your uniform or your regular street clothes,

72
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:20.110
you're not going to try.
I don't understand that.
I always loved that.

73
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.800
Way Back in the day when Kevin Mchale,

74
00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:25.870
I remember we were playing that playoff series and we blew this team out the

75
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:28.720
first game and the other team was in the locker room saying that we better watch

76
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:33.010
out Celtics better watch out game.
Two cars were coming and Kevin Mchale goes,

77
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.800
well yeah,
you should be coming every night.
This is the NBA

78
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.830
completely diffused the whole fucking thing.
Oh,
you're going to try.
Well,

79
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:45.310
we're trying every game.
So you know,
just to keep it interesting.

80
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:50.080
Why don't you try.
Um,
anyways,
having said that,
I really liked the,
uh,

81
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.640
the wizards team man,
um,
young team.
They played great.
I just kept one,

82
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:57.370
you know,
basketball being a game of runs.

83
00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:59.560
I just kept waiting for them to hit this streak where they weren't going to be

84
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:02.890
shooting well and they just fucking killed it all night.
My only complaint,

85
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.270
and I mentioned this tape,
I did Bill Simmons podcast hype.

86
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.640
My special that's coming out January 31st whoring myself out.

87
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.870
I was mentioning the only thing I did like about the wizards the other night was

88
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:18.871
when John Wall dunked on Kelly Olynyk and then he flexed afterwards.

89
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.430
I get it.
It was a nice dunk.
It was an explosive moves,
but at the end of the day,

90
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.770
you went around Kelly Olynyk.
Okay.

91
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:34.771
Who essentially is like a parking pylon that seven feet tall wears it a little

92
00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:39.700
Bandana.
That fucking guy,
man,
I swear to God,

93
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:43.600
if he was six,
NBA loves a seven footer.

94
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.950
If you have a seven in front of you and for,
for your height,
forget it.

95
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.490
You're going to get drafted and you're going to hang around on some fucking
team.

96
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:55.780
I swear to God,
if that guy was six foot 11,
he'd be directing traffic.

97
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.190
Um,
anyway,
I know that's harsh.
I don't know shit about hoop,
you know.

98
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.240
Wow.
Whatever.
I just need,
he gets out,
you know,

99
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.730
he draws a couple of offensive files.
I'll give him that,

100
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:10.910
but he's always around the ball,
but it never ends up in his hands.

101
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.800
He tries to jump.

102
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

103
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.950
<v 1>Then like every 19 games they'll hit like five,</v>

104
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:21.760
three pointers and every second here she's going to turn the corner.
Um,

105
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.670
anyways.
Yeah,
it was a great game.
Marcus smart,
having the meltdown,
you know,

106
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.120
wanting to be out there and then immediately apologized on Twitter's a lot of,

107
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.260
there's a lot of great,
you know,
Celtics away,
more fun to watch this year.

108
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.200
And I haven't been watching,
you know,
the Bruins as much as I usually do,

109
00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:41.420
only because it's going to kill me to watch them fire Clo Julian.

110
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.170
I just don't want to see that.
I love that fucking guy.
Um,

111
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.620
but maybe May,
I dunno.
Maybe it's time.
I guess that's how it works.

112
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.620
You know what I mean?
The whole coaching thing,
you,

113
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.290
if you hang around long enough,
they're going to fire you.
Right.

114
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.120
Players go for the money and shit.
I don't know what it is,
but uh,
you know,

115
00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:04.530
we beat the red wings.
That was a good one.
And we got the penguins coming up.

116
00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:07.290
Maybe we'll see.
We'll see what happens.
But,
um,
we're still there.

117
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:08.510
We're still do the eighth seat.

118
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

119
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.000
<v 1>Oh,
what happened to the team,
man,
I've been doing that the whole game.</v>

120
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.800
But anyways,
I watched a little bit of the whole year.

121
00:07:16.801 --> 00:07:21.740
I've been whining about the fucking Bruins.
I'm going to stop.
Who knows?
Maybe a,

122
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.320
we bottomed out.
We're on a way to,
well,
the seventh seat,
who knows?

123
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.630
There was watching the,
uh,
the Celtics first,
the rockets tonight.

124
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.320
And uh,
you know,
I just got it on the NBA package.
It just records.

125
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.510
And what sucks is I wish it is anybody know how to set it.

126
00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:39.930
So I always get the Boston feed because I love listening to Tommy Heinsohn.

127
00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:41.340
You know,
he knows the game.

128
00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:45.690
He's a hall of Famer and he's a total homer and he announces the game.

129
00:07:45.691 --> 00:07:48.000
Like he's still sitting on the bench or are you still coaching the team?

130
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:52.200
It's fucking great.
So tonight I got the,
uh,
the,
um,

131
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.880
the Houston feed and uh,
you know,

132
00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:59.610
so they're obviously pro Houston,
which I don't have a problem considering.

133
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.040
Tommy Heinsohn is so fucking pro Boston.

134
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.540
And what was great was tonight James Harden gets fouled,

135
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.470
spins around in the air and just fucking smacks.

136
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.280
Uh,
Yoanis Jerico right in the fucking mouth,

137
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.320
draws blood and everything.
And Tommy Heinsohn's flipping out,

138
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.810
I was able to see that Bill Simmons retweeted this thing.

139
00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:24.610
So Tommy Heinsohn's flipping out and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah going you quite,

140
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.210
she could've called that from half court,
you know,
all this shit.

141
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.680
Cena was a total dirty play and the refs are reviewing it and the Houston guys

142
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.490
just going like,
oh,
that's just a,
it was unfortunate.
Uh,
Chi,
he was finished.

143
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:39.630
He was just trying to get his balance.
He was a,
he was following through.

144
00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:41.970
It's an unfair,
you see,
he immediately apologize.

145
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.230
This is why I think the refs got it right,
that they called it a flagrant foul.

146
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.390
Aside from the fact that that guy was crying the whole game,
you know,

147
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.620
like young Sidney Crosby or Tom Brady at his,
you know,

148
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:57.960
when he's in a bad mood in anybody brushes against him,

149
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:02.290
he turns around and looks at the ref leggings.
That's my uniform.
Um,

150
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.750
I keep saying there's a pats fan,
you know,
um,
what's his face?

151
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.350
James Harden was acting like that the whole fucking game.
The whole fucking game.

152
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.970
He's just bitching at the refs
every fucking time.

153
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:16.340
Anybody comes near me once a call.
Right?
I mean,
maybe,

154
00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:19.400
I don't know shit about who,
maybe he just was having a bad night.

155
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.260
Maybe the chicken usually banks it Boston when he comes to town,

156
00:09:24.261 --> 00:09:27.320
fucking found true love.
It was on the rag.
I don't know what it was,

157
00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:29.300
but that guy was definitely in a mood.

158
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:30.960
<v 1>It is a,</v>

160
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.730
this is why I think it was a flagrant foul cause when he smacked him in the

161
00:09:33.731 --> 00:09:37.110
fucking face,
he immediately apologized,

162
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:40.390
but not to Yonas he looked at the raft and went,
oh,

163
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.400
so like he was trying not to get the file.

164
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:44.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

165
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.750
<v 1>If you really,
if you fucking smack somebody in the face accidentally,
what,</v>

166
00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:51.890
who did he apologize to?
Some other guy that you didn't hit.
Don't you apologize.

167
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:52.724
Oh,
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:54.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

169
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.810
<v 1>Try that.
A Bar,</v>

170
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.150
something like you don't get yourself one of those little girly drinks and spend

171
00:09:58.151 --> 00:10:01.360
yourself around the floor.
It backhand somewhat across the face,

172
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.950
causing them to draw blood and then just pick some other guy standing.
Ah,

173
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.780
but it was an accident.
I figured that one out.
I don't know.

174
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.420
I love that he got the flavor and file and the Celtics ended at three game

175
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:17.260
losing streak.
But uh,
I'm really enjoying the,
uh,
the NBA.
I never,

176
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:22.200
I fucking,
I left it for so goddamn long,
but a hockey will always,

177
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.850
always be my first love.
I'm just kind of a,
I don't know.
I'm waiting.

178
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.230
I got a bad feeling.
Oh,

179
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.460
I got a bad feeling there that the hammer is about ready to fall there.

180
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.110
Um,
so anyways,
I've been whoring myself out like a lunatic.

181
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.900
It's why I'm taping the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

182
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:44.901
moneyball podcasts on a Wednesday night because I got to do some more stuff

183
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:49.320
tomorrow.
I'm doing the cow herd show tomorrow.

184
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:53.370
I did rich eyes and show today had a great time on that.

185
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:56.430
Did Jimmy Kimmel the other night.
They had a great time.
And uh,

186
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:58.950
you know what I've noticed cause both Kimmel and uh,

187
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.040
eyes and obviously a big sports fans and I've noticed debt like

188
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.610
<v 0>okay</v>

189
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.660
<v 1>with Boston sports we've had so much success that they can't even trash the</v>

190
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:14.740
teams anymore.
So now they just sort of go after you as a fan.

191
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.320
Like when I was on Kimberly was going like,

192
00:11:17.321 --> 00:11:20.770
so like you have like a man crush or something on top for Kenneth came at me

193
00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:23.980
with that angle and when I was on eyes and show he's going like,

194
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.230
why are Boston fans still so mad?

195
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:32.050
Like they've completely left the field of play and the other like,
hey,

196
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.200
you sitting in the fucking mezzanine level.
Whoa,

197
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.350
how come you got one ear socks pulled up?
And the other one is,

198
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.540
<v 0>yeah,</v>

199
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.130
<v 1>I don't anymore.
They are,
you know,
it's just one of those,
it's just,</v>

200
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.550
it is what it is.
That's how many fucking championships they've won.
They,
they,

201
00:11:45.551 --> 00:11:46.690
you know,
they got nothing to say.

202
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.410
I'm not trashing to get one of those guys cause I like,
I like,

203
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.940
but I did notice that as sports fans,
that's,
that's kind of the way that they,

204
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.150
that they come at you.
But,
um,

205
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.380
I gotta give a big thanks to both of them for having me on this shows in,
uh,
and,

206
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:01.630
uh,
everybody at the Jimmy Kimmel show,

207
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:05.320
they put together this little gift package for my daughter,

208
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:07.210
a little Jimmy Kimmel,
uh,

209
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.680
the cutest thing ever for a toddler little coat and a bunch of children's books.

210
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:14.810
So I can't wait to read them to my daughter when,
uh,

211
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.980
I guess when she understands,
because evidently now she's just sort of,

212
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.760
somebody told me that they don't recognize anything.
All they see is lights.

213
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.920
Like it's an acid trip for,
I don't know how many weeks,

214
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.700
so she wouldn't stop crying.
And I'm walking around with their,
you know,

215
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.940
babies have this,
this thing where like if you walk around with them,

216
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:31.900
they stop crying,

217
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.730
but the second you sit down or God forbid lay down that kind of like,

218
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.220
oh wait a minute.
No,
no,
you're not doing that.
And then they cry.

219
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.460
Then you stand up.
I,
it's good,
let's keep it moving.
You know,

220
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.370
I feel like I'm an officer and a gentleman,
right?

221
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.030
And my baby's giving me the Louis Gossett Jr treatment,
you know,

222
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.650
making me keep my legs up but want to fly jets.
Right.
So,
um,

223
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.690
anyway,
so once I got that information that they're kind of a,

224
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.860
it's kind of an acid trip is a good way to stop your baby from crying I've found

225
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.310
is when you went walking around isn't working,

226
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.680
just start spinning going,
woo.
Right.

227
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:12.670
Just start doing that.

228
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.630
They just start looking around like it's the greatest acid trip ever.

229
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.470
It had just started looking around like,
wow man,
what the fuck is that?

230
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.520
And then they stop crying.
I just learned that 20 minutes ago.

231
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:28.360
I've only tried it once,
but it totally works.
You can also,
as you're doing that,

232
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.480
there's different ways you can spend and you can kind of lift them up and lower

233
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:35.470
him,
do like the tilt a world kind of thing.
Um,

234
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.510
for however long you can stand it before,
you know,

235
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.970
you end up yacking on your own kid,
you know,
if,
if,

236
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.990
if you're one of those people that gets motion sickness.

237
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.060
But I found out that I found that that works.

238
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:50.110
So I'm trying to put something positive out there for all the negative shit that

239
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:53.210
I've heard about having a kid.
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,

240
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.570
anyways,
uh,
what else do I got?
Do I have anything else?
I got nothing man.

241
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.880
I feel like I'm drunk.
I've had such a little amount of sleep.
It's actually,

242
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.010
it's actually hilarious.
I've always found baby's crying funny though.

243
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.540
You know what I mean?
Cause they sound adorable so it's already funny.

244
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.780
And then all she want to be like,
like what are you crying about?

245
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.910
You don't have any bills,
there's no stress.
You know,

246
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.540
like what deadline do you have to meet?
You know,
what,
what,

247
00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:28.540
what's going on tomorrow?
That enough stress built up that you crying?

248
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.690
It's just strikes me as funny.
I mean,

249
00:14:31.691 --> 00:14:34.840
I know they're trying to communicate before you give me your fucking kid pop

250
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:39.580
psychology fucking horse shit that I've just had coming out my ears.
Um,

251
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.480
or like if I'm on a plane and when kids cry,
it's never annoyed me.

252
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.080
Even if I get on the plane,
hung over the second kid starts crying.

253
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.610
It just makes me like,
I,
I,

254
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.020
I just started laughing because I always think like,
you know,

255
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.240
that's exactly what I'm feeling right now.
Anytime you get on a plane,

256
00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.530
there is that thing.
Once they close the door,
you're like,
oh,
it's gonna suck.

257
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.030
You know?
Even though it's amazing,

258
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.770
you can fly across the country in six hours is fucking incredible.

259
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:14.660
But it is not comfortable is far as what you're used to with comfort,

260
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.673
<v 0>you know?</v>

261
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.570
<v 1>I Dunno.
It'd be great,
you know?
So what they should do,</v>

262
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.890
if they ever come up with a time machine,
they should send people back in time.

263
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.980
Not to change history,
you know,

264
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:31.690
not to do something good like Tom Cruise going back and kill.
And Hitler,

265
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.590
whatever the fuck he was trying to do in that movie,

266
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.900
they should just send you back just so you could see how hard life was seeking.

267
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.500
Just stop bitching,
you know what I mean?

268
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.500
Or I guess you could go to like a third world country or something like that.

269
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.663
<v 0>You know,</v>

270
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.780
<v 1>spend one day with like a fucking water carrier,
whatever the hell you call it,</v>

271
00:15:49.781 --> 00:15:52.060
their version of a canteen balancing on your head,

272
00:15:52.061 --> 00:15:54.670
walking like 20 miles past fucking,

273
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.780
I don't know what God knows what kind of wildlife,
you know,

274
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.050
through a civil war and all this other shit.
You know,

275
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.040
trying to stay away for some baby formula that some corporation over here puts

276
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:12.100
out
fucking kid up.

277
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.650
Do that for a couple of days and he'd come back here.

278
00:16:14.651 --> 00:16:18.700
I bet up all this shit that we bitched about probie probably wouldn't be as bad.

279
00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:21.790
Right.
I guess you wouldn't need a time machine,
you know?
See that you like that.

280
00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:24.520
I just worked that all out all by myself.
Here it is.

281
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:28.420
I thought we needed a time machine and all I needed to do was just travel.

282
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.150
And you know what,
I,
I think that,
I think there's,

283
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.890
there's some sort of something in that.
I have no idea.

284
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.570
Anyways,

285
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.450
I ran into that dude tonight who told me I'd never play fucking drums again once

286
00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:42.790
they had a kid.
I was breaking his fucking ball so bad.

287
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.440
Are you going to be a data you'll never played drums again now really?

288
00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.500
I went up to him.
I was like,
yeah,
yeah.
Why did you say that to me?
He goes,

289
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.620
you watch,
you won't.
I just find,
just said,

290
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:56.530
Dave Grohl has like two or three fucking kids.

291
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.240
He plays drums and guitar and sings in a band that travels around the fucking

292
00:17:01.241 --> 00:17:05.800
world.
You idiot and he's cracking up laughing.
He goes,
yeah,

293
00:17:05.801 --> 00:17:09.220
but then he's such a negative country goes,
yeah,
but his drums aren't at home.

294
00:17:09.221 --> 00:17:12.510
It's like,
yeah,
they are.
I saw the fucking documentary.

295
00:17:12.511 --> 00:17:14.020
He's got a studio in his house.

296
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.340
He was recording with his band and in his kid came and said,
hey,

297
00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:20.530
you want to go swim in?
And he goes,
yeah.
And he goes out,

298
00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:23.680
he goes swimming and then he goes back and he writes another hit song.

299
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.363
<v 0>I Dunno,</v>

300
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.531
<v 1>this fucking guy,</v>

301
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:33.710
he's acting like it's the 18 hundreds and five are standing behind a team of

302
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:36.110
oxen and some kid came up to me,
I'll be a gag.
You know,

303
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.520
I don't have time to play with you.
I got to keep plowing the fucking field here.

304
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.500
I don't know.

305
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.980
I got to learn to block this shit out because I was doing so well and other

306
00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:49.010
parents give me anxiety.
But I'm so proud of my kid.

307
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.730
Keep showing everybody pictures.
I don't show pictures,
but if something,
hey,

308
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.750
I congratulate you had a kid.
I just guy you brought it up.

309
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:57.300
Now I've got to show you.
I never thought I'd be that guy.
But you get,

310
00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:01.530
you got to do it.
You got to do it.
But my wife gave me,
all right,

311
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.210
let's uh,
let's,
uh,
let's do this here.
Let's do a,

312
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.820
let's read a little bit of advertising.
Oh my mind.

313
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.680
My mother in law came over today and she said that she got upset cause she went

314
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:18.681
online and I was joking around on Kimmel and somehow they took something that I

315
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:21.660
said out of context and says,
Bill,

316
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.420
Bill Burr has a kid and doesn't enjoy being a parent.

317
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.133
<v 0>Oh</v>

318
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.810
<v 1>Ah,
the Internet.
It's not even the Internet,
it's just fucking people.
Right.</v>

319
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:39.360
And Shit.
That's the funniest.
I want to,
you know,
something,

320
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:43.390
if I could do this business over again,
I wouldn't be the guy I would,

321
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.710
that's what I would do.
I would want to get into entertainment journalism

322
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.700
because it has to be the funniest job ever.

323
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.120
If you're in a room with other people and just sitting there trying to think how

324
00:18:56.251 --> 00:19:00.900
disgustingly out of context you can take something and just crying,
laughing,

325
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.310
thinking of the person that you're fucking over it,
like their,

326
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.930
their reaction to what you're doing.
Um,

327
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.930
I guess they do it so much that nobody really reacts to it,
but I always find it.

328
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.700
Ah,
I duNno.

329
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.200
It's just funny to me because it's such a [inaudible] thing to do and it's just

330
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:21.030
funny to me.
Cause you're not really hurting anybody.

331
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.220
You're just trying to get eyeballs onto the website.
Right?
I Dunno.

332
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.490
Am I still speaking English?
I swear to God,

333
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:32.700
I almost just fell asleep right there.
All right.
The black talks everybody

334
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.280
as opposed to the White Tux,
the Black Tux.
Oh,
by the way,

335
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:41.220
somebody said not to say cut too much in the,
uh,

336
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.950
in the,
uh,
the advertising read.
That's,

337
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.880
that's where I've come to,
you know,
on the entertainment ladder,

338
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.260
people who've just so accepted the fact that I'm a fucking moron,

339
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.140
that they just go a,
you know,
read it however you want to.

340
00:19:58.141 --> 00:20:01.590
If you could just try to keep it under six concerts,
you know,

341
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.180
w we,
we,
I think,
I think we can enjoy it.
All right.
The Black Tux,

342
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:11.181
everybody looking great for a wedding or a special event has never been easier

343
00:20:11.851 --> 00:20:16.851
with black tux.com with everybody knows it's not yours.

344
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.590
What,
who owns a tox?
Fiona talks like you,
you're,
you're in the Illuminati,
right?

345
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.220
Or you're like,
whatever the male version of Meryl Streep is,

346
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:29.100
where they just giving you awards all the fucking time and you just,

347
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.510
it just becomes like,
I got to get a Tux.
I'm a blowing 30 grand a fucking year.

348
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.650
All right,

351
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.020
with black with the black tux.com as opposed to that black talks.

352
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.940
This is the black tux.com like the Ohio State University with high quality

The doors just strip down to your fucking boxers or you just go,

359
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:28.120
I'm just going to come in here and close the door.
Is he standing outside?

360
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.390
They opened the door.
All right.
It fits.
What do you think?

361
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.230
I think you'll go right.
He's hanging in there waiting for his tip.

362
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.670
I'm going to get a Tuxedo just to see how this goes down and get this,

367
00:21:55.451 --> 00:22:00.070
Well how the fuck am I going to try it on?
If it's online,
how do I do that?

368
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.160
Is there an app for that to have the robot me on the screen trying on a Tux.

369
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.240
Hey robot me really seems to like that one.

All right,
let's,

400
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:00.680
let's try and make it up on this one.

401
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:04.760
Distilled Dstl D.

402
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.710
Um,
if you're skipping your car payment for a new pair of jeans,

403
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:13.610
you're probably paying too much or you're driving a piece of shit one way or the

404
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:15.050
other.
Sure.

405
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:19.730
You want a bargain bin Denim that's going to fall apart.
Oh wait,
sure.

406
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:23.870
You don't want,
yeah,
you don't want one of those and your nuts and hanging out.

407
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.930
Right.
Unlike in those black Tux t CEOs.
Right?

408
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.320
But they're really good parents cost hundreds of dollars until now.

409
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.010
Distilled Peled,
spelled d e.

luxury grade graded denim.

412
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.220
So you get genes that would normally cost you a hundred starting at just 75

413
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:47.910
bucks.
It's $20 less than that fucking Tuxedo.
They eliminate it.

414
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.160
Excessive markups by refusing to work with middlemen.
Well,

415
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:55.860
what if we delivered it?
Get the fuck Outta here.
Uh,

Sorry guys,

432
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.390
I didn't want to read when I got sleep.
Is Cso.

433
00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.910
CSO is the place for comedy.
They won't tell you how amazing they are,

434
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:07.700
but I will see SOS.
Amazing.

435
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.630
It's comedy for comedy nerds by comedy nerds.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.080
Cso Spelled S.
E.
S.
O.

437
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.400

Sand I don't like ads and I'm fucking read one streaming service bringing you

440
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:29.060
hilarious.
Original series,
handpicked classics.

441
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.810
Weeks of standup specials and more of,
what do you mean handpick?

442
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.600
Like the hanging on fucking tree?
Well,

443
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.370

CSO,

444
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:45.840
every episode of SNL ever.
That's what it is.
What I like about this thing,

445
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:48.000
including new episodes the day after the air,

446
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.860
the tonight show starring Jimmy Fallon and late night with Seth Meyers,

447
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.800
uh,
the day after the air,

448
00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.150
and they even have classics like 30 rock parks and recreation and saved by the

449
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:03.120
bell.
This is like the Lauren Michaels challenge channel,
right?

450
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.280
He's got all his shit on.
I bet he's got money in this thing.

451
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.930
Even British comedies like the original office with Ricky Gervais',

452
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.660
the entire Monty python catalog,

453
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.140
the it crowd and Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge.

454
00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.150

456
00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:26.650
big.
Like Louis C k when he had hair.
Chelsea Peretti,

457
00:27:26.651 --> 00:27:30.820
Amy fucking shoe,
Bo Burnham,

Finding a great new wine is tough.

475
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.100
That's why I've been telling you all about our sponsor club,

It's gotta be a limit,
right?
Weeks,

496
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:57.640
a hundred percent satisfaction.
Guarantee means if you don't like it.
Okay.

497
00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:01.540
I already said that you just don't send random bottles.
You don't just what?

504
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.870
Wouldn't it be great if a bunch of people that love boozing it up and getting

505
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:27.220

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.400
You know,
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty easy so far.

528
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.710
I don't know what all you guys have been whining about.

529
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.600
I don't know what you've been preaching about.

530
00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.100
You know what you're so fucking concerned about.
You know,

531
00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.920
maybe,
maybe you guys who are parents,

532
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.770
maybe you need to pick up an instrument stopping.

533
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.060
So goddamn obsessed with your fucking kids.

534
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.293
<v 0>Okay.</v>

535
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.460
<v 1>I'm just kidding.
All right.
I'm just fucking around.</v>

536
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:19.010
I just need to throw shit out there that people then can take out of context

537
00:32:19.011 --> 00:32:21.950
because that helps me because then people search for me and then they'll
realize,

538
00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.660
oh,
wait a minute.
This guy is a special coming out January 31st

539
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.430
I taped it.
The Ryman in Nashville,
Tennessee had a great time.
Uh,

540
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:33.403
by the way,

541
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.740
thank you everybody that bought all the tickets to the Patrice O'Neal benefit as

542
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:41.570
only a few left,
uh,
looks it's going to sell out yet again this year.

543
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.680
Very excited about that.
And um,

544
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.650
it's just going to be a great time in February.
All right.
Um,

545
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.190
makes a great Valentine's Day gift.
You know,

546
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.840
it makes a great me gift.
What if you're single and you don't have anyone?

547
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.000
Does that mean you shouldn't get a gift?
In order to find love,

548
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:06.050
you need to love yourself.
Well.
Why don't you love yourself and buy,

549
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.880
buy yourself a gift by a pair of tickets for yourself,

550
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.513
<v 0>right</v>

551
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.660
<v 1>to the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.</v>

552
00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:17.700
Then you can go there and you can have a little bit of leg room.

553
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.090
You can look over.
You know,
as you laughed through your tears.

554
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.880
Realize that you're still single.
I haven't.
Happy Sad.
Just buy one.

555
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.010
Maybe you get on the aisle.
Who knows?
All right.

All right.

557
00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.290
What's going on in spoiler?
There's no football,
right?
There's no football.

558
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:39.930
I tell you right now.
I got to tell you.
I'll tell you right up,

559
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.400
the soup ball's going to be a classic.

560
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.473
<v 0>All right.</v>

561
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.440
<v 1>I feel like it's,
it's a,</v>

562
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:50.441
it's 50 50 Pat's got a 50 50 chance and uh,

563
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.980
Atlanta.
Let's see.
Let's do the math.
They,
they have a 50 50 chance to,

564
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.570
that's where I'm at.
All right.
I would take,
if,
if Atlanta gets,

565
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.040
I don't like only getting three.

566
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.620
The bed I want is Atlanta getting points?
That's what I want.

567
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.910
I think them getting points is a great bet,
but not only three,
you know,

568
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:16.800
four is a little scary.
You start talking five.
That looks like a good bet to me.

569
00:34:16.801 --> 00:34:19.560
And I can tell I can say that without a fucking doubt.

570
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.530
Cause I watched at least nine games this year.

571
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.940
You heard it here from the fucking freckles mouth.
Alright,
go fuck yourselves.

572
00:34:26.941 --> 00:34:27.774
Have a nice weekend.

573
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.543
<v 2>She</v>

574
00:34:56.930 --> 00:35:00.260
don't give a damn.

575
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.270
There has

576
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.050
to be plan

577
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:24.503
B.

578
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.040
I wonder,
wanted to

579
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.010
<v 1>talk about,
oh,
so my wife</v>

580
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.270
<v 4>for whatever fucking reason,</v>

581
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:44.450
absolutely loves that show that American greed and um,

582
00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.940
she watches like three of those episodes every fucking night before we go to
bed.

583
00:35:49.941 --> 00:35:50.091
And I,

584
00:35:50.091 --> 00:35:53.330
and I and I always ended up falling asleep cause it's the same fucking story

585
00:35:53.331 --> 00:35:56.750
over and over again.
You know,
it's the same thing.

586
00:35:56.751 --> 00:35:59.850
The guy starts a fucking business.
He in the party,

587
00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:02.990
he's faking it till you make it.
He gets a bunch of investors,

588
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.090
he hands out fake spreadsheets.

589
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.920
Then you've got these fucking innocent people just go and like,
you know,
all I,

590
00:36:08.921 --> 00:36:12.740
you know,
I shy,
shy,
they recharge.
You know,
I was getting dirty,
appreciate it.

591
00:36:12.741 --> 00:36:15.650
And I was like,
Whoa,
it's shower was like a good year or me.

592
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.123
<v 0>All right.</v>

593
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.300
<v 4>And then they always go,
you know,
there's always get some really bad metaphor.</v>

594
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.750
They invested in an ice cream chain,

595
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.210
but this wasn't the flavor they were looking for.

596
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.590
When do we return glass in the ice cream?

597
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.350
<v 3>Oh Wow.
Oh Wow.</v>

598
00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.670
<v 4>That fucking song for American greed,
I'll tell you,</v>

599
00:36:40.671 --> 00:36:42.620
and I was going to end up on fucking American grade,

600
00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:44.930
is that cunt who shut that lion?

601
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.980
Everybody's talking about this dentist that went over and illegally poached this

602
00:36:48.981 --> 00:36:52.160
lion that was friendly with people.
I love that shit.
Oh,

603
00:36:52.161 --> 00:36:55.610
is it a friendly with people until what?
It bites somebody fucking head off.

604
00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.410
Fucking unreal.
You know what I mean?
Everybody's fucking salient gas.

605
00:37:00.411 --> 00:37:04.550
The pit bulls,
you shoot a fucking line every like,
oh,
he was nice.

606
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.490
He was a good line.
I'm not saying it was a bad line.

607
00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:08.930
I'm not saying the guy shouldn't have done it.

608
00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.630
I think everybody's missing the fucking story here.

609
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:12.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

610
00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.430
<v 4>All right.
Speaking of American greed,</v>

611
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:20.670
this guy paid 50 grand.
All right.

612
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.470
That's just for the fuck.

613
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.850
That's not even for this flight to go over there and kill this fucking lion.

614
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.553
<v 0>All right.</v>

615
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.870
<v 4>Oh,
trying to stir anything up here.
But how to fuck in a dentist.</v>

616
00:37:33.871 --> 00:37:38.871
Afford to drop 50 grand to fly to Africa to shoot a fucking lion?

617
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

618
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.970
<v 4>Illegally.</v>

619
00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

620
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:45.990
<v 4>Just take it.
Of all the,</v>

621
00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:49.440
how expensive the shoes he had to buy that he had to sneak around and they had

622
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:54.190
to be some sort of Ninja were fucking,
I'm going to shoot it.
Uh,
uh,

623
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.940
protected lion were that he had on,
right.

624
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.500
Guy Drop 50 grand on that and now he's gone underground.
They go over his house,

625
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:06.390
he's got a match,
right?
And all they're talking about as his fucking line.

626
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:09.060
And I'm,
I'm watching an episode of American greed.

627
00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.880
<v 3>Oh Wow.
Wow.</v>

628
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:17.820
<v 4>Ooh,
I got a fucking your phone off or I'm in fucking how many teeth you fill it.</v>

629
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.180
This guy's pulling teeth.
He's,
I'm telling you right now,

630
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.510
I used to work in a dental office,
right?
And I,

631
00:38:27.511 --> 00:38:30.540
there was some good dentists just like cops.
There's some good cops,

632
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.240
there's some bad cops.
And I'm not talking about interrogation,

633
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.360
talking about brandishing a weapon.
Uh,
no,

634
00:38:37.361 --> 00:38:41.080
I'm talking about fucking people pulling teeth that didn't need to be pulled.

635
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.250
Fucking doing root filling fillings on teeth that did not need to be fucking

636
00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:50.251
drilled into because they bought a car beyond their own fucking needs or

637
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:55.960
whatever.
Their,
their,
their financial responsibility.
All right.

638
00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.640
I think this guy should be fucking taken back there just for the simple fact,

639
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.090
just for the simple fact that,
that he uh,

640
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:10.270
he went to another country.
It did that.
What do we got over here?

641
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:14.020
Does the MGM still have a lion?
What if he,

642
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:19.060
what if somebody from Zimbabwe came over here?
What about at the MGM Lion?
Right,

643
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.140
right.
As they were recording that you're watching an MGM film.

644
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.680
They fuck the police.
Turn the air conditioning back on.
Yeah.
The lovely knee.

645
00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:32.050
Everybody,
she came in.
This is a studio man.
Dave Letterman had it cold.

646
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:34.900
I'm having a cold.
He lasted fucking 30 years on television.

647
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.180
I want to do 30 years of podcasting.
Huh?

648
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.980
Well,
what's good is the air conditioning.
If you're going to fucking turn it off.

649
00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:48.210
Listen,
I'm talking about that dentist that went out,
went over to Zimbabwe.

650
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.300
You got to go grab a mic from the,
uh,
from the closet there.
I,

651
00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.880
you know,
no one wants to listen to somebody.
Just hit pause here.
I fucking,

652
00:39:56.881 --> 00:39:58.510
I never hit pause.
Um,

653
00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:00.430
<v 0>yeah.</v>

654
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:04.000
<v 4>Do you know that story in here?
This dentist from Minnesota,</v>

655
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.310
he's a B.
You know,
like,
he's one of those big game hunters,
you know what I mean?

656
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:10.420
He's one of those fucking guys.

657
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:14.780
I'm going to shoot something that people think is scary and that could be the

658
00:40:14.781 --> 00:40:16.300
guy I killed that shit.
You know,

659
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:20.950
like it went up and he fucking put it in a choke hold.
It's like you didn't,
you,

660
00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:23.290
you went over and you shot it.
The fact that you can go,

661
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:27.130
you can walk up and kill an armed man,

662
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.720
a human being with a gun.
You could fucking kill.
You could,
you could tell it.

663
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.320
Even if he knew you were coming,
you have a gun.
He has a gun.
You could do that.

664
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.530
So now you're going up to a lion.
The thing doesn't have a gun.
So,
I mean,

665
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.680
how fucking difficult is that actually they shadow with a crossbow,

666
00:40:41.681 --> 00:40:43.870
but there a reason why they shut with a crossbow is cause they were trying to

667
00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:48.340
disguise it.
Doesn't he have,
he's gone big game hunting before,
right?

668
00:40:48.341 --> 00:40:50.260
Like he's done an align.
Well,

669
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:55.090
here's the thing that I saw some weirdly alarm headline being like,
you know,

670
00:40:55.091 --> 00:40:57.890
he's like a serial killer of animals and it's like they,

671
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.470
the way they were putting it was like,
you know,

672
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:02.040
this is what he does all the time.
I don't know.
He had him,

673
00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.950
he's one of those guys,
he thought he doesn't seem like he kills to eat it.

674
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.370
A assists for sport.
Yeah.
He's one of those guys to be like,
Yay.

675
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.480
You ever hear of an alligator fucking shot one in their head as he put it up in

676
00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:16.930
his study or something like that.
He's one of those guys.
So we weren't,

677
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:19.760
what about him?
He fled,
right?
Like he,
uh,
he will goes over,

678
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:24.420
he went over to Zimbabwe like a crossbow and he fucking went into some like

679
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.480
wildlife sanctuary.
Allegedly.
This lion was friendly with people.

680
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:33.170
I love that shifts all the lion see solo or whatever it was.
It was,
yeah,

681
00:41:33.171 --> 00:41:37.310
it's friendly until it isn't for the one day you do something that reminds us of

682
00:41:37.311 --> 00:41:39.800
something from his childhood and it fucking bite your head off,

683
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.480
but yet it's what it's supposed to tell.
What's a line?
Yeah.
It kill Shit.
Yeah,

684
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:48.200
of course.
So he went in and he fucking killed it to capitated.
It's skin.

685
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:51.740
The fucking thing.
Yeah.
He wants to head.
Yeah.
First of all,

686
00:41:51.741 --> 00:41:56.600
how do you get the head back?
I don't know.
I don't want to know that.

687
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:57.740
You got to go gym bag.

688
00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.513
<v 5>Good.</v>

689
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.700
<v 4>Drain it out.
They probably do it.
They're like,
oh no.
You know what he did?</v>

690
00:42:03.701 --> 00:42:07.900
He probably taxidermy.
Well he probably like takes the fucking,

691
00:42:07.901 --> 00:42:10.480
just the skin from the head.

692
00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.240
You bring that back and then you just,

693
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:17.760
you have somebody like make a like a lion skull and then you put it over that

694
00:42:17.761 --> 00:42:20.770
cause no one was going to connote the skull isn't in there.
Right.

695
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.070
This is the kind of shit,
this is like no idea.

696
00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.650
Let me ask you this near because you're into American greed.

697
00:42:26.651 --> 00:42:31.060
This guy's a dentist.
He paid 50 grand to do that.
Now he's gone underground.

698
00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.030
They're going by his house.
He has a mansion.
This guy's a dentist.

699
00:42:34.031 --> 00:42:37.390
He's a mansion is gone.
All these expensive fucking uh,
you know,

700
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:40.870
going around killing all these,
how does a dentist have all that fucking money?

701
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.740
Is he like a Hoity toity fancy dentist that like doesn't take any insurance at

702
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.850
all.
Like self pay.
And then I worked in a dental office.

703
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.300
Nobody was going on a safari.
Even if just look at them.
Forget about to,

704
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:56.350
I just want to safari.
How much money that is?
Forget about.

705
00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.310
You're going to go over there and then sneak back later.
Kill a lion.

706
00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:04.540
Butcher the fucking thing and sneak it back.
Yeah.
I don't know.

707
00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:05.830
He sounds very sketchy though.

708
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.420
<v 5>Oh Wow.</v>

709
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.063
<v 2>I will</v>

710
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:26.643
drink.

711
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.560
So Liz,
Liz,

712
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.863
Liz,

713
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.050
I've got it.
Go.

714
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:50.580
You don't know

715
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:06.490
<v 5>cause he's not going to fuck with and what he wouldn't know cause we don't do</v>

716
00:44:06.491 --> 00:44:09.010
that.
You mean you don't do that?
We don't do that.

717
00:44:09.011 --> 00:44:13.300
You guys like to do that whole race working with animals and I'm in listening to

718
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.950
what people watch these shows about like wilderness and survival and like naked

719
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:19.540
and afraid.
It's like,
I mean there,

720
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.720
there was one black dude that I saw in the commercial,

721
00:44:22.721 --> 00:44:24.070
but like for the most part,

722
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:27.190
and you can always find one person that's going to be an exception to the rule,

723
00:44:27.191 --> 00:44:29.490
but it's like,
I don't know why white people feel like they need,

724
00:44:29.491 --> 00:44:34.110
it's a constant like fuck with or like be out in nature naked.

725
00:44:34.111 --> 00:44:38.160
Like we've evolved past that path and why are you doing it?
I don't get it.
Yeah,

726
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.220
<v 4>because we're bored.
Oh really?
Yeah.</v>

727
00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:44.620
We don't have a cause we're not being oppressed.

728
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.000
It's just you need to give you that sort of mirror.

729
00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.200
When Russia 16 hours a day,
that's it.

730
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.980
That's what we jump around and flip around and skateboards and shit.
We're bored.

731
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.490
Oh Jesus.
That's so terrible.
I'm not saying it's terrible.

732
00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.820
We're just board.
Generally speaking,
white people.

733
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:05.060
<v 5>Remember when I showed you that for certain income we're board where there is a</v>

734
00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:07.820
white guy like standing on a cliff,
like I don't know,

735
00:45:07.821 --> 00:45:11.060
like the Grand Canyon or someplace really fucking scary and it's like,
you know,

736
00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:12.650
white people will do shit like this.

737
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:16.130
But then they'll like cross the street when walking on the same side with like a

738
00:45:16.131 --> 00:45:19.790
black person.
I know they'll stand on the ledge of some fucking,
you know,

739
00:45:19.791 --> 00:45:22.460
clever or like Mount Everest.
It's like what are you guys doing?

740
00:45:22.461 --> 00:45:23.450
Like what are you trying to prove?

741
00:45:23.451 --> 00:45:28.451
What all that wrestling gators in the by you like what the fuck is what I love

742
00:45:28.791 --> 00:45:30.470
all that.
Why and Australian

743
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.880
<v 4>fucking accent.
And then you brought up the by you in fucking new world.
Right?</v>

744
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.750
<v 5>Well like why I really though,</v>

745
00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:41.220
it's what the nature in the flocking with animals,
why do you do that?

746
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.870
I mean,
can't you do that with every culture and race?
Be like why do you do that?

747
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.220
I suppose,

748
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:50.670
but I feel like white people really like push the envelope in terms of these

749
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:54.400
extreme experiences in nature.
And like,
I don't,

750
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:57.690
I dunno because we were,
we don't have any gangs.

751
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:03.480
White people have gangs.
What are you talking about?
They're like a ferret.
Many.

752
00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:06.180
There are many white gangs.
No,
but like,
okay.

753
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:09.530
Name Them Jesse James Gang,

754
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:15.840
plant gang.
Uh,
I'm white.
People have gangs come on.
You know,

755
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:19.700
like in certain areas like,
you know,
groups like,

756
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:23.730
well we don't have labs.
We have governments,

757
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.470
governments,
those are you?

758
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.350
<v 4>I shit,
it's like main stream.
Okay.</v>

759
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.440
I remember a long time ago I got this fucking hilarious talk with Patrice.

760
00:46:33.481 --> 00:46:36.600
Can you,
can you push that thing so it's not rattling over there?
Oh my God.

761
00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:41.370
This whole ac situation is,
it's what we live in an old house.

762
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:41.941
Okay.

763
00:46:41.941 --> 00:46:46.941
The fucking heaters rattled a little bit that we run the AC through freezing in

764
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:52.770
here.
Um,
oh goodness.
You gotta fucking Afghan on.
I know.
And I'm still cold.

765
00:46:52.771 --> 00:46:54.660
That's how I got this hilarious RB one day.

766
00:46:54.661 --> 00:46:58.830
Like Patrice when he used to just get sick of white people,
would,
you know,

767
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:02.730
he just would stop coming down to the club for a little bit and then sometimes

768
00:47:02.731 --> 00:47:06.920
he would call me up and vent about white people.
No,

769
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:09.100
he would vent at me representing,

770
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:11.830
<v 5>okay,</v>

771
00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:16.270
<v 4>what time I'm sitting at home just being white,</v>

772
00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:17.283
you know,

773
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:21.460
hanging out and having a fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

774
00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:26.560
phone fucking ranks.
I pick it up and like,
hello.
And he just goes,
Bill.

775
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.800
He goes,
what are white do?

776
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:35.380
And so you made me say a log.
What do you mean?
He goes,
what?
What?
What do you do?

777
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.880
I'm like,
I was like,
did you just get pulled over by a cop?

778
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:45.760
Like what,
what?
Where's this coming from?
Like what do you mean?
What do you mean?

779
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:49.990
What do we do?
Like what?
He's like,
what do you do?
Like what do you mean?

780
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:54.280
He's like,
black people.
We do this,
we do that.
What do you guys do?

781
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.150
You go as hilarious like you say.
Yeah.
But the thing about it is,

782
00:48:00.151 --> 00:48:03.640
and as you answer him,
I fuckin answered them like I go,

783
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:07.840
what do you mean what do we do?
You just don't recognize our shit is mainstream.

784
00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:11.590
It's,
it's like hiding in plain sight so you don't see it.

785
00:48:11.591 --> 00:48:12.281
So you don't think that,

786
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:14.650
that you don't think that there's any sort of culture or anything?

787
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:18.970
Like what do we do?
Um,
the,
all the ECC,
look at skateboarding.
Okay.

788
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:20.410
They came from surfing,
you know,

789
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:23.590
and the fucking ways weren't there and Exynos skateboarding and totally evolved

790
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:27.670
in the,
to what that is,
what stock car,
Polynesian people were doing.

791
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.790
Stock car racing.
I'm not going to sit here and have you,

792
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:32.920
ted tried to tell me that white people didn't come up with anything.

793
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.990
I'm just fucking do that.
All the fucking Thailand.
Your most advanced ketchup.

794
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:42.540
Shut up.
I don't know.
Skateboarding.
Polynesians came up with skateboarding.

795
00:48:42.541 --> 00:48:43.180
I know,
but escape.

796
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:47.020
I saw that documentary with Dogtown and see boys and a fucking empty swimming

797
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:48.400
pool at Santa Monica.

798
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:53.020
But I thought skateboarding came from surfing and this is only Polynesian
people.

799
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:54.940
I don't know.
I could be wrong.

800
00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.930
He thought what didn't surfing come from Lang indigenous people.
Oh No,

801
00:48:58.931 --> 00:49:03.160
I'm talking about skateboarding.
I know,
but skateboarding came from surfing.

802
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.560
It was sort of derived of that.
Yes sir.
Right.

803
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.230
So saying but then surfing come from,

804
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.840
so you're saying white people don't get credit for skateboard?

805
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:13.570
I didn't say that.

806
00:49:13.571 --> 00:49:18.571
I was just asking who came up with a thing that inspired skateboarding.

807
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.430
I'm just wondering,
I'm just wondering what this is like.

808
00:49:24.431 --> 00:49:28.410
Literally then this becomes the argument ended.
Pamela.
Patrice.
All right.

809
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:32.130
Stop cars.
Stock car racing.
Okay.
That came out of moonshining.

810
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.160
What does that stop basically during prohibition when alcohol was fucking

811
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:38.560
illegal,
right?

812
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.620
What you would do is if you will fucking bringing illegal booze.

813
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:48.220
Moonshine ma'am.
Oh cool.
You know,
cross state lines and all that type of shit.

814
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:50.800
You wanted a fast car,
but you didn't want it to look fast.

815
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.740
So what you did was it looked like a stock car.

816
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:57.370
I guess stock car you got from Detroit that just looks like a Chevy that looks

817
00:49:57.371 --> 00:49:57.941
like a Ford.

818
00:49:57.941 --> 00:50:01.600
But underneath the fucking hood you soup the fucking thing up and you were able

819
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:04.480
to outrun the cops and the cops didn't have fucking radios back then.

820
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.340
So these guys that did this shit,

821
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.630
all right would talk shit about my car is faster than your car.

822
00:50:10.631 --> 00:50:12.130
No it isn't blah blah blah blah blah.

823
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:14.860
So they started racing and that started stock car racing.

824
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.000
That's a cultural fucking thing.
So then it's on fucking TV.

825
00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.860
So I started listing all of that shit.
He was actually going late.
He said,

826
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:27.950
I think at one point he went,
he said,
good answer,
what he said.

827
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:31.310
And I just am like fuck you.
I'm not asking for your approval.

828
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.740
This whole fucking conversation is annoying.

829
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:37.820
Is that car race seem like something that's very important to people?

830
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.480
Like I said,
like a big deal.
No,
no.

831
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.800
You're looking at cause cause I know what you're going to do.

832
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.480
I think I came out wrong.
I'm not,
I'm not even gonna get into this

833
00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:49.851
music.

834
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:53.240
And then everything in music is somehow going to go back to the fucking blues.

835
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:57.950
Like Beethoven heard the fucking blows and the fucking Irish music and all that.

836
00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:59.600
He actually,
the nozzle be like,

837
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:03.050
well it all came from the Pyramids and black people built those.

838
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:05.720
How would you know that?
How would you know that?

839
00:51:05.721 --> 00:51:08.780
Because you went to [inaudible] dot com and you fucking read shit that said you

840
00:51:08.781 --> 00:51:10.910
guys did it.
Like that is the dumbest shit.

841
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:15.410
Like that whole fucking credit thing is so fucking stupid.
Everybody for coming.

842
00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.960
So that's African.
So that's black.
I know.
It isn't.
No,
they're not,
aren't there?

843
00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:24.980
They're African.
Yeah.
So that's my point.
Yeah.
So,
so like when you see,

844
00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:29.420
when you see an Egyptian guy,
right?
You think that guy looks like you.
Okay.

845
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:33.120
I don't know.
I feel like some of them are realized.
So I'm French,

846
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:36.600
German and Irish year French.
So yeah,
I have a little bit of French,

847
00:51:36.601 --> 00:51:40.350
but I'm mostly German.
Irish.
Let me finish.
Oh,
so I'm European,

848
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.090
so mean Italians.
Yeah,
we're on the same fucking page.
So Ferrari.
Yeah,

849
00:51:45.091 --> 00:51:49.700
that was us.
That was us.
That was pasty.

850
00:51:49.701 --> 00:51:52.460
Freckle guys.
We did that shit.
Give me a fucking break.
No,

851
00:51:52.461 --> 00:51:56.630
you guys invented like vodka good and stuff like that,
man.
No,

852
00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:01.450
no.
Irish,
Russian,
sy.
Sorry,
I don't,

853
00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.330
I don't know the history.

854
00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:08.030
I didn't want to get into this fucking debate as more of a,
like a,
yeah,

855
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.420
German Irish whiskey.
Um,

856
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.410
what's the other ones?
Bourbon.
No.
Is that an American thing?
Most,
yeah.

857
00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:21.950
They got just from Scotland.
Bourbons,
Kentucky whiskey was,

858
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:26.030
but Egypt is Africa now.
It's everything is,
was nausea's point.
Is that,

859
00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:29.390
was that a true thing that he said?
Africa is a fucking continent.
Yeah.

860
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.900
It is not a race.
It's a continent where you go.

861
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:37.990
So like Irish people take credit for shit that happens in Romania because

862
00:52:38.271 --> 00:52:41.480
they're all European.
I feel like those are reason why this is different,

863
00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:44.340
but I don't know why I said I'm not going to answer that question.
Yeah.

864
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:47.730
But I feel like,
can I fucking have that written on a tee shirt?
Like

865
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.650
I feel like an Egyptian per se.

866
00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.510
I am African or would they say I'm Egyptian?

867
00:52:55.511 --> 00:52:58.810
They would probably say I am Egyptian.
Yeah.
I don't know enough about,

868
00:52:58.811 --> 00:53:00.730
all I know is that all this shit is in Africa.

869
00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:05.140
So have you met anybody over in Europe saying I'm European.
No,
they go,

870
00:53:05.141 --> 00:53:07.450
I'm French.
That's true.
I'm swish.

871
00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.980
This is a,
this is the,
actually this is like a toxic,

872
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:16.790
this always becomes a toxic conversation.
But credit man,
no,

873
00:53:16.791 --> 00:53:17.780
I'm talking about you and me.

874
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:21.080
I'm just saying it cause I don't want to stir up everybody cause it's very

875
00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:24.850
easily.
Yeah,
it can go off the rails and it becomes this big fucking race.

876
00:53:24.851 --> 00:53:28.180
You're a fucking racist and all this type of shit.
Um,

877
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.790
resist the urge to read too much into this people.
Um,
anyways,

878
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:38.940
I'm just so soccer,
was it for white people is what you were saying?
No,
no,
no.

879
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:43.380
I'm not saying
wow.
You know what I hate about this conversation?

880
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.230
What I hate about this conversation,
I know it's easy.

881
00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:51.420
I can't say I can't find anything.

882
00:53:51.421 --> 00:53:54.000
If I say it like they can't come back and said it's true though.

883
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.570
If I say anything,
then all of a sudden it's,
it's this,

884
00:53:57.571 --> 00:54:00.810
this and this and there's a whole bunch of shit that I'm leaving off

885
00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:07.520
cause I'll then become,
I'll be called a fucking elitist.
Okay.
What did we do?

886
00:54:07.521 --> 00:54:09.320
We fucking pretend to go the moon.

887
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:17.060
The space shuttle.
That's the shit where you just see it on TV.
Okay.

888
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:21.740
That's,
that's some shit that we did.
I mean that's,
that's kind of a cool,
no,

889
00:54:21.741 --> 00:54:24.680
it's amazing.
I know the astronaut's weren't rapping.

890
00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.330
They didn't have this space suits hanging off their asses.

891
00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.690
I know that the kids didn't want but the kids coolest,

892
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.220
but the kids still wanted to do it.
Get the fuck out of here.

893
00:54:36.221 --> 00:54:40.040
You got a mother fucker out there.
Probably a brown with the,
I'm just,

894
00:54:40.041 --> 00:54:43.940
I'm just getting your go cause I see you wind to leap out of your skin right
now.

895
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:48.890
Uh,
I
hate when you do that.

896
00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.330
My brother used to do that.
Do what you just say shit to get me going.
I'm,

897
00:54:53.331 --> 00:54:56.380
I'm being honest with you and I'm saying what I'm feeling and don't just be

898
00:54:56.381 --> 00:54:59.690
sitting and you think I can't say some shit to get you going.
I know you can.

899
00:54:59.691 --> 00:55:02.740
You do all the time.
I'm sorry,

900
00:55:02.741 --> 00:55:07.630
I shouldn't have mocked stock car racing or any of that stuff.
That wasn't nice.

901
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:10.430
Yeah.
The thing,
you know what the fuck are the,

902
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.900
is one of the greatest things about stock car racing.
Okay.
Is what's going on.

903
00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:17.860
The level of intellect in the pit versus across the racetrack sitting in the

904
00:55:17.861 --> 00:55:20.410
stance.
That's why I love going.
We're car races.

905
00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.610
And is that why people think that are elitist or something?
No,

906
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.790
because you've got these guys like what the fuck they have to do because it's so

907
00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:31.090
regulated now just to try to squeeze it and then the fucking hundreds of a

908
00:55:31.091 --> 00:55:34.260
hundredth of a second to try and win this fucking race.
The,
the,

909
00:55:34.261 --> 00:55:39.070
the level of science,
physics and all that shit that's involved that these guide,

910
00:55:39.071 --> 00:55:42.580
the fucking eggheads shit that's going on in there and then right across the

911
00:55:42.581 --> 00:55:45.350
track is just fucking okay.
Okay.

912
00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:50.643
I don't know.

913
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.910
I went to the Indianapolis 502 years in a row,

914
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.350
I went to drag racing.

915
00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:00.220
Do you know in between races they pull the whole fucking engine out and rebuild

916
00:56:00.221 --> 00:56:04.780
the whole God damn thing.
Inbetween racist.
There's a whole team of guys.
Why?

917
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.030
I don't know why.
Because it matters that much.
Everything has to be brand new.

918
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.740
Okay.
I like that cool song you guys made up,
right?
Brand know everything.

919
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:18.790
Sorry.
Everything has to be fucking brand because if it isn't,

920
00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.550
if it isn't a brand new fucking engine,

921
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.930
the amount of money they could you that split second it costs.

922
00:56:24.931 --> 00:56:28.120
She was a different like six figures.
A lot of money.
That's what they're doing.

923
00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:30.580
When they stop and all the guys run over and they're like,
no,
no,
no.

924
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:33.430
And drag and drag race.
They're,
they're changing the engine.

925
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:36.580
I thought they were just like [inaudible] on the tires and like wiping off the

926
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.690
windshield.
No,
I'm not talking.
I'm sorry.

927
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.910
Oil and some maybe.
No,
no.

928
00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.240
In that type of racing gentlemen,

929
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:49.130
Start Your engines on,

930
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:53.180
ain't one of those little air fresheners from the rear view mirror.
Right.

931
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.760
Um,
you know what I'm talking about a drag racing,

932
00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.490
you know those long skinny cars with the big fucking tires.

933
00:57:01.491 --> 00:57:03.890
Then they got the parachute comes out.
Uh Huh.

934
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:08.100
Hey engine sits behind the driver probably figured out to do that after years of

935
00:57:08.101 --> 00:57:11.280
them trying to see around it.
Why did they have a parachute though?

936
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:15.420
Don't they have breaks?
They do,
but it's going 300 miles an hour.
Oh.

937
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.900
So you need all the help you can get and they don't have flaps to put it down

938
00:57:18.901 --> 00:57:21.180
and you can't reverse the edge and like a plane.
I see.

939
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:25.500
And they're landing faster than a fucking seven 47 but it doesn't weigh as much.

940
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.800
But there's on there,
that's all the fucking physics.
Okay.

941
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:30.300
And it's also probably if they stop quicker,

942
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.840
they don't have to fucking make as big as a track.
And that saves,

943
00:57:33.841 --> 00:57:35.850
the guy owns the track money,
all of this shit.

944
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:40.680
All his fucking nerdy egg head shit.
Hmm.
All right.
Okay.

945
00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.840
So this is what white people do.
They get,
they get off,
they get on,

946
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:50.450
they get on a dirt bike and they figure out how to go off a ramp and flipping

947
00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:51.780
the air two times over,

948
00:57:51.781 --> 00:57:55.500
and they landed the foam and they figure out how to do that and then they try to

949
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:59.700
it.
Yeah,
they were booked board for fucking bored.

950
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.940
Why people need gangs again,
like if you notice like white people,

951
00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:08.320
I thought we weren't going to get on all this and the 20s you,

952
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:11.490
when you had the gangs in New York,
was that the 18 hundreds of fucking bills

953
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.760
we would do you know what it was?
I know I can really track Matt,
Matt,
Matt,
Matt,

954
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:21.500
Matt.
Yeah.
I could really trash white people,
right?

955
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.190
<v 6>Oh Man.</v>

956
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:45.410
<v 2>Was born to run these.
Do</v>

957
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:54.480
what?

958
00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.380
You got space.

959
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.790
So let's get

960
00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:13.150
another job.

961
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.153
I got it.

962
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:28.863
No,

963
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:40.310
no,
no.
