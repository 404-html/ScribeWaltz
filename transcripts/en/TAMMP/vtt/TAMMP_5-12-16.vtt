00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.830
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.720
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And I just checking.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.020
I'm just checking in on you seeing how you weeks go and that's all I'm doing

4
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:16.231
here.

5
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:21.000
Just running my fucking freckled Yap for another 30 minutes in my God damn life.

6
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.571
And you know what?

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.990
You're going to sit there and listen to it unless you don't want to.

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
Then you can always hit stop.
You can find another website.
You know,

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.450
watch some porn at work.
Pretend you're working,

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.280
puts you right or left hand and your slacks,
your action slacks,
you know,

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.173
rub one out.

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.030
Tell people later you got to lay off the glazed donuts.
Oh,

13
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.050
come on bill that that early in Jesus Christ.

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.730
You go with the just joke that fucking early in June this,

15
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:56.580
this does not show a lot of promise.
That was an under a minute.

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.900
The first just joke.
You know what I mean?
That's like when you watch one,

17
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.000
you know,
quickest knockouts,
you know,

18
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.060
and you're looking at the other guy like why the fuck did you even show up?

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.460
You know,
I could've done that.

20
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:11.250
I could've gone in there with no fucking training whatsoever.

21
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
What's so and I could have got my fucking ass knocked out in less than a minute,

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.183
you know,

23
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.550
although I wouldn't have the balls to then go try to figure out what I did wrong

24
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:22.890
and then come back to potentially have it again.

25
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.630
And that's what separates the audience member from the professional fighter that

26
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:29.970
gets knocked out in a minute.
You know,

27
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:31.750
whenever you see that there's always that guy do it.

28
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.950
Really.
You could've gotten top physical condition,
your tub of Shit.

29
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.610
You fucking sit in there.
Who eats fried dough at a boxing match?

30
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:43.780
I didn't even know they sell it.
They studied.
No,

31
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.530
they sold that shit at a boxing match.
You Fat.
Fuck.
What'd you think?

32
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.330
What'd you find that?
Huh?
He's like some fucking food whale.

33
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.370
You know like when,
when the,
when the,
um,

34
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.410
degenerate gamblers show up and they get flown in and they get this giant sweet,

35
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.220
they're like go fucking valleys.
You know,
they roll out the red carpet.

36
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:06.390
Fuckhead you already paid for it.
They're looking for you to buy another jet.

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.020
You know,
they probably do that with people who are really fat.

38
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.440
You know what I mean?
When they show up,
hey,
just to let you know,

39
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:16.180
fet frank showing up and now he's going to the box and match.

40
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.350
So let's bring in some extra shifts and add to the menu.

41
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.110
Who gives a fuck if no one else eats fried dough,

42
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:26.900
this guy will eat enough fried dough to justify it.
You know?
No.
All right,

43
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.450
whatever.
You got to just joke,
I'm making fun of fat people.
This,
this isn't good.

44
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.220
Oh,
this is what you're probably thinking,
gees,
bill,

45
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:36.570
your energy's a little bit high for Thursday afternoon.

46
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.520
Or maybe you're not thinking that.

47
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:42.060
Maybe I'm saying you think in that and I'm getting in your fucking head,
right?

48
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.190
That we advertise is filled that they do.

49
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.520
If they show one every five seconds rather than,

50
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.410
than just getting annoyed on Internet,
the Internet,
you're going to be like,
Oh,

51
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:53.580
you know what?
I think I will fucking book.
I never watch them.

52
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.930
Which is really hypocritical because I have,
I have advertising on this podcast,

53
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.010
but you also have the option to just
fast forwarding it,
you know,

54
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.220
just still a pain in the ass.
What I like about youtube,
it's like,

55
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.300
you must watch this.

56
00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:10.190
So what I always do is I hit fucking mute and then I just scroll down to sooner.

57
00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:13.410
I read some of the comments and I just,
just at the top of the screen,

58
00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:17.120
I could see that things slide across and then I know it's fucking,
oh,

59
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.520
you know why he's about 20 years ago I was in a bar and this woman was an

60
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:27.900
advertising that I met and she kept telling me that it works.
Go,
it doesn't work.

61
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.280
Sometimes it annoys me and it makes it,
she goes,
no,
but it's in there.
It works.

62
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.160
It totally works.
She just kept saying,
no,
it works.
It's just like,

63
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.500
and I was so young and dumb.
It's like,
Bill,
this is the industry she's in.
Okay.

64
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.650
Why don't you just go tell somebody that their religion is wrong?
You know?

65
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:47.250
Of course she's going to defend it.
What she gonna do.
Say,
yeah,
it doesn't work.

66
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.910
And then she's going to go to work in the morning.
But I was younger,
you know,

67
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.290
full head of fucking orange,
red hair,
doing my best.

68
00:03:55.291 --> 00:03:58.830
Talking to the ladies down on Newbury Street,
right?
What do you say?

69
00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:01.860
They're fucking all black dress.

70
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:06.780
They're fucking golf looking chick.
That's all I remember from back then.

71
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.090
All those fucking golf.
Look at chicks.

72
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:14.010
Just fucking walking around down on Newbury street did doc Martins and all that

73
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:17.430
shit.
You go over to daisy Buchanan's.
That was the meat market,
right?

74
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:19.080
That was the chicks that went to the gym.

75
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.400
Unlike the golf wants that were on Newbury street.
There were all fucking sad,

76
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.670
you know,
taking the weight of the world on their shoulders,

77
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:29.130
those whores and daisy Buchanan's.
They didn't give a fuck.

78
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.320
They still don't give a fuck.
You know what?

79
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:35.220
It makes me fucking star fish tattooed above the butt crack.

80
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.850
Just walking around.
They didn't give a fuck.
Um,

81
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.820
guide.
Walk in there with my fucking waste link leather jacket,
my driving gloves.

82
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.270
Little did they know I stepped out of an 83 Ford fucking rage.

83
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.320
Two wheel drive,
the extra log bed vinyl seats.

84
00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:58.380
Five speed had a radio,

85
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.460
but somebody smashed the window and took it.
Oh yeah ladies,

86
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.060
that's what you're fucking,
your dreamboat has arrived.

87
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.600
<v 0>Seinfeld,
like white sneakers,
you know the high tops coming in,</v>

89
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.020
you know,
dad jeans that were considered cool back then.

90
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.460
Maybe a sweatshirt that says spirit or whatever the fuck his spirit.
I Dunno.

91
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.850
It's a bad fucking image.
Um,
but it's a true one.

92
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.450
I'll tell you what isn't a bad image.
Did you guys watch?
Uh,

93
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.310
well I guess it is a fear of Dallas Stars Fan.

94
00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:34.790
Did you guys watch game seven seven seven seven seven

95
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.200
the St Louis Blues.
Oh,
me,
me and say Louie.
Louie.

96
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.520
See You at the western conference finals.

97
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.590
Don't tell me the blues are choking.
This is a different year.

98
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.230
Fucking Saint Louis Blues.
I'm going to repeat this.

99
00:05:55.231 --> 00:06:00.231
The St Louis Blues had a game seven in somebody else's building and not only did

100
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.030
they win,
they gave him the old right there,
right there.

101
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.780
Five to one.
They were up five to nothing.

102
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.380
At one point they were leading the series three to two and they got that

103
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.040
fucking,
they've got their lunch served to them,
they've got their hats handed,

104
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.200
whatever you want to say in game six.
All right?

105
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.120
Couldn't close them out.

106
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.750
And then they were going down to Dallas and I don't give a fuck how big of of a

107
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.940
Saint Louis Blues Fan you are,

108
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.570
you know God damn well you've been slapped in your,
in your,

109
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.600
your fucking sports fan face too many times by the St Louis Blues as Dick.

110
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.680
Okay.
They do it to every fucking year.
If they get you excited,
you go,
oh my God,

111
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.310
here we go.
The playoffs right in the face and then it's fucking over.

112
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.330
You know it,
right?

113
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.840
So you probably thinking that they were going to fucking blow it against the

114
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.710
black cocks and holy shit,
they came back and they did it right.

115
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.300
So now they get another game,
seven against the Dallas Stars.

116
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:00.320
And as much as you will say,

117
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:03.620
and you're a fan and you believe and you got your little trinkets and you

118
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:06.640
sitting in your lucky chair in the back of your head,
you know,

119
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.460
you go and these are the blues,
they're gonna fucking blow this.
And Jesus Christ.

120
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:15.050
Did they give you guys an easy ride?
Huh?
Three to nothing after one,

121
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.180
then four to nothing.

122
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.170
And I know God damn well when you're rooting for a perennial fucking loser,

123
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.440
right?
That always breaks your heart.
You need five goals.

124
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.770
Do you need five goals to feel comfortable?
You know,

125
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.000
I remember all of this shit back before we started winning every champion that

126
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.800
champion ship that exists.
Um,
yeah,

127
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.340
fucking red sox.
I was comfortable with like a 1213 run lead,

128
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.020
but not if we were playing the Yankees and it was only the eighth inning prior

129
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.830
to 2004.
I was not comfortable with it.
So,
um,

130
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.170
what a fucking,
they just,
they just went down and they just fucking,

131
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.940
just everything they throw at the net fucking went in.

132
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.230
Even what terrorists Sankoh's that weird.
His goal ever.
He's trying to pass it.

133
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:07.100
He's almost parallel with the net and it did like the magic bullet JFK thing and

134
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:11.510
somehow went into the fucking back of the net and they took that away and I was

135
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:14.510
like,
Oh God.
And then fucking stars are flying up and down the aisles.

136
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.500
They're stars at night,
a big and Bright

137
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.000
Dallas right there.
Fuck,
sorry if flying all over the fucking ice.
And I'm like,

138
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:27.610
watch this.
Here come the stars.
They're going to get the fucking equalizer,

139
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.370
right?
And then it's going to change the whole fucking shape of the game.

140
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:33.800
And then the fucking blues scale that gave him the old right there,
Fred,

141
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.260
two more fucking times,
if I remember correctly.

142
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.880
And then all of a sudden was fucking three to nothing and then four to nothing,

143
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:44.150
then five to nothing.
And then the fucking stars scored a goal and I said,

144
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.910
Oh shit,
don't,
they don't even tell me.

145
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.800
But then I just started doing the math going like,
all right,

146
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:51.110
this 10 minutes left,
they need four goals.

147
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.600
They'd have to score one every two and a half fucking minutes.

148
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.030
And then like two and a half minutes went by and then it's like I'm not doing

149
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.510
the math.
This is for,
this game is fucking over.
And um,

150
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.870
<v 1>yeah,</v>

151
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.970
<v 0>I said the game was over when it was five to nothing.</v>

152
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.060
But even though I said that I wouldn't have left.

153
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:12.090
Like most of the fucking douchebags fans there were along the boards.

154
00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:16.180
Did you see how many fucking fans left?
They're not even fans.

155
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.690
Those are all the hookup culture that just went out to some VIP place
afterwards.

156
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.850
They really made,
they always make the,
the,

157
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.280
the fans of the team look bad because I know the upper deck was still packed and

158
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.920
when the stars last five to one everybody was left,

159
00:09:29.921 --> 00:09:33.200
was standing on their feet applauding them.
I'm just letting stars Fan.

160
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.970
I'm not judging your fan base by those fucking,
the hookup con,

161
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.340
the ones who know the people at the radio station,

162
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.300
the fucking whores that are then going to go to a steak house and try to bank

163
00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:46.540
some 90 year old guy and fucking get his ATM pin number.

164
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.920
I'm not judging you guys buy them.
You know when the game's over,

165
00:09:50.921 --> 00:09:53.590
they should pan up to the upper deck and see all the fucking die hards.

166
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.610
But I'm sad to see the stars go.

167
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.110
Obviously they got some net mind a problems and Sagan didn't play the whole

168
00:10:02.111 --> 00:10:05.440
fucking,
he didn't play the whole play offs.
And I'll tell you right now,

169
00:10:05.441 --> 00:10:07.540
that's why the Bruins,
that's why the Bruins got rid of them.

170
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.950
Got To make myself feel better.
That's why we got rid of him.
We know we,
oh yeah.

171
00:10:11.951 --> 00:10:16.240
He'll get you 30 40 goals during the regular season.
Where is he in the playoffs?

172
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.230
Huh?
What happened to him?
What happened to him?

173
00:10:20.231 --> 00:10:24.760
Did he sprain one of his abs dancing with his shirt off and some fucking one of

174
00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:26.260
those coyote ugly bars.

175
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.480
It's what the fuck he was doing when he was playing with us.

176
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.770
<v 2>I don't even know.</v>

177
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.770
<v 0>That's true.
That's what the rumor was.
All right,
here we go.</v>

178
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.530
<v 1>Okay,</v>

179
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.240
<v 0>well let me see here.
Eh,
Tyler Sagan injury.</v>

180
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.680
What happened to him?

181
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.970
Well then a bag and then we're going to say he's got a lower body and the waist

182
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:51.200
area injury,
injured stars.
Tyler sagans makes progress,
but not enough.

183
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.240
A lower body in Juvi.
They always say that it's always a lower body body injury.

184
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:58.940
That means you're fucked up your shoulder.
You know,

185
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.780
cause if they say what it is in these fucking animals will actually,
uh,

186
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.120
actually go after it.
So yeah,
Tyler Sagan was a fucking no show day right now.

187
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:11.810
Mark Messy Aa.
He would have gotten his ass out on the ice.
Oh yeah.

188
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.960
You know.
Dot.
Tye was saying,
you know,
he's just a little fucking underwear model.

189
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.790
I'm fucking with you.
Well,
my kid,

190
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.150
I've been one time I fucking blocked a wrist shot and pickup hockey and I was

191
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:32.730
limping for like fucking 10 days.
Right.
That's the level of pussy I am.

192
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:35.330
So I'm just fucking around with Dallas Star fans here.
Uh,

193
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.510
but congratulations to the blues tonight.
Um,
predators,

194
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.620
San Jose sharks
game seven.

195
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.540
And I don't know who I want to win.
I like,
I love the predators cause I dunno,

196
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.470
I just liked the fucking Unis and a squish them,
whatever.

197
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.070
Get the into fucking hockey.
And there's something about this,

198
00:11:56.071 --> 00:12:00.300
just something funny about the sharks choking every year.
And I don't know why,

199
00:12:00.301 --> 00:12:05.250
but I just do not respect San Jose as a sports town.
I just can't do it,

200
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.540
you know,
I don't respect it.
Cause nutty.
You have the balls to live downtown.

201
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.310
You all live outside.
You know,
when you safe little high little houses,

202
00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:15.140
I know high,

203
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:20.140
they're all made out of ticky tack and we're afraid to go downtown.

204
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.920
All my God is that a trolley?

205
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.830
You have a fucking trolley going through the center of town.

206
00:12:25.831 --> 00:12:29.130
How much more quaint than they have to make it.
I'm just fucking with you.

207
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:34.140
Downtown San Jose's no joke.
Um,
in fact,
I remember,

208
00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:38.580
uh,
the comedy club died.
Somebody got shot and killed.
It was fucking hilarious.

209
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:42.180
And then the Comedians,
like,
I forget who the fuck it was that week,

210
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.770
but they took the picture and they had like the whole Improv,

211
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.210
like marquee out front with the name of million.
But the comedian,
you know,

212
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.240
probably had some wacky photo there and then they just have a body with like,

213
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.470
you know,
God damn blanket over it.
Um,

214
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.230
so I understand that.
Um,

215
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.720
but then I was thinking what would be cool is if the sharks and the blues play

216
00:13:03.721 --> 00:13:05.940
each other,
then somebody will finally,
uh,

217
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.740
sort of break their curse to get to the finals.
Um,

218
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.290
I don't know what the sharks I've ever made a final.

219
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:14.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

220
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.880
<v 0>And I dunno if the blues,
I don't know.</v>

221
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.860
I can't remember the last time the blues did.

222
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.820
The last one I remember was they was against the fucking Boston Bruins and I

223
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:27.400
wasn't even a really old enough to even have watched that.

224
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:30.850
They might've done it sometime in the 90s and,
or,
or in the two thousands.

225
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.140
But I was doing so much standup.
I missed a lot of hockey back then.

226
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:40.141
So let's look this up saying Lois blows last finals.

227
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.190
Yeah.
I don't think they've been in it in forever.
Last finals appearances.

228
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.053
All right.

229
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.200
Saint Louis Blues Financial Problems in playoff streak.

230
00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:00.190
1970 1987.
Let's see.
List of blue seasons.

231
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:04.000
I don't need this shit is too much here.
Stanley Cup champions.

232
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:07.630
That's a big goose egg conference champion.
I think that's a goose egg too.
No,

233
00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:09.250
it isn't because they've been to the finals

234
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.570
conference champion Stanley Cup champion.
They won't have it.
Come on.

235
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.450
You know what?
Somebody just texted me this cause I,
I don't want to fucking,

236
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.850
this is year by fucking year.
Somebody actually looks at this shit watching.

237
00:14:23.851 --> 00:14:26.310
Aren't you looking at,
Oh this isn't what the fuck I wanted to look at.

238
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.700
Season was shortened due to strike in 94 95 to [inaudible].
That's a,

239
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.190
you know,
I thought I answered to ask the question pretty fucking clearly.

240
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.370
You know Saint Louis Blues Blues History.

241
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.850
Do I have to hit pause,
disowned self?

242
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.760
That is smack a bitch.
Remember that from fucking
Stanley Cup record.

243
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.000
Here

244
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.833
<v 3>we go.</v>

245
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.350
<v 0>Saint Louis Blues Stanley Cup.
But you know what,</v>

246
00:14:59.351 --> 00:15:01.570
go fuck yourself.
Fucky winter net every once in a while.

247
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.930
And I thought you had all the answers or at least somebody's making an attempt

248
00:15:04.931 --> 00:15:08.650
to give me one.
It's not how it works.
So whatever.

249
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.230
I think,
um,

250
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.210
I think I almost want the sharks the win tonight because uh,

251
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.690
<v 3>okay.</v>

252
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.140
<v 0>I Dunno.
Just stand out.

You know,</v>

253
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.090

Oh,
back and forth.
They're blues predators.
He know.

254
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.450
I don't know if that's almost like a subway series of a southern cities.

255
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.400
St Louis is a southern city.

256
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:34.550
They tried to act like they're fucking from the Midwest.
Yeah.

257
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:37.070
Go there and talk to some people.
Jesus Christ.

258
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.570
Everybody there's got overall it's fucking unbelievable,

259
00:15:41.571 --> 00:15:45.560
and they got a Budweiser right in that little fucking pocket.
Um,
I'm kidding.

260
00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:49.550

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.690
I'm going to get my fucking ass in shape here cause I am in writers from shape

266
00:16:12.691 --> 00:16:15.090
right now and I'm dealing with science,

267
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.020
um,
which is almost gone.

268
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.090
Um,

269
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.780
I've been taking my antiinflammatory drugs and doing all these fucking stretches

270
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.760
at an even have to go to a chiropractor.
Um,

271
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.880
I don't need it keeps telling me to go,
so maybe I'll go.
But anyways,

272
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.860
I got my fucking,

274
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.400

275
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.223
<v 3>MMM.</v>

276
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.070
<v 0>And then I got a,
I got a bench,
I got a fucking squat rack,</v>

277
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.210

I get a dip thing.
And then I also got my climbing rope.

278
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.493
So there we go.

279
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.850
And all I gotta do is take my dog for a walk around the block from my cardio.

280
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.630
Nothing fucking crazy that beaten up the knees of the feet,

281
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:13.430
eat a salad every day,

282
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.770
Lay off the booze.
That ain't happening.
Lay off the cigars.
That might happen.

283
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.230
I have a,

284
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.880
I'm smoking two in June and then I think I'm done until October.

285
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.680
And if I do that,
then I'll only have smoked 10 for the year.
And uh,

286
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.920
I even think that's too many.
I just think it's too many.
I'd like to be,

287
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:38.150
I'd like to smoke six a year.
This is what I'm going to do next year.
All right.

288
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.410
It's going to be,
I'm smoking New Year's Day at the Rose Bowl.

289
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.210
I'm going to smoke at the super bowl.

290
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.850
Then I'm not smoking until my birthday in June.

291
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.550
And then I'm going to smoke once a year.
I go to a big college football game.

292
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:53.040
I'm going to smoke then and then that's it.
I smoked for a year.

293
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.600
I fucking enjoy the shit out of it,
but I don't blow out my jaw,

294
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.980
my tongue on my throat or any of that stuff.
I don't need that.

295
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.730
I don't need that my fucking life.
So,
um,
speaking of which,

296
00:18:03.731 --> 00:18:06.070
you should probably ask yourself at this point.
So bill,

297
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.280
what is the big college football game you're going to this year?

298
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.160
Tell you right now,

299
00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.050
Florida gators taken on the Lsu Tigers within brand new head coach.

300
00:18:18.051 --> 00:18:22.320
You will it fucking Walco whoever the fuck he is.
I don't know who he is.
Um,

301
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.090
I'm beyond excited to go down there to the swamp.
Um,

302
00:18:28.091 --> 00:18:32.140
I actually really like love both those,
um,
programs.

303
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.410
I mean,
I liked the Florida gators way back.

304
00:18:35.411 --> 00:18:38.200
I just always thought that orange helmet with the blue shirt was just fucking,

305
00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:42.430
was the shit.
Um,
somewhere along the line moving out to Los Angeles,

306
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.300
college football coming on so early and I had the time to watch it instead of

307
00:18:46.301 --> 00:18:48.300
driving a gigs on Saturday,
I,
uh,

308
00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:53.020
got into Lsu with the mad hatter is coach and,
um,

309
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.730
I dunno,
that's going to be a tough one.
I don't know who to root for in that,

310
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.250
what I want to go Lsu,

311
00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:03.400
but I don't want to be that cut that goes to somebody's stadium and fucking

312
00:19:03.401 --> 00:19:06.220
roots against the home team and meaning that it's not like I'm that fucking

313
00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:09.790
emotionally invested,
um,
to be a Douche bag,
you know,

314
00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:13.810
I'm just going to go there and just hope it's a good game anyways,
so,
um,

315
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.720
I don't know where I'm going to be performing,
but somewhere in that area,

316
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.080
that area and um,

317
00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.720
really fucking looking forward to that.
So,
um,
I don't know.

318
00:19:25.721 --> 00:19:30.280
So two more cigars in June and then I'm going to be done for awhile allegedly.

319
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.710
Ah,
yeah.
Right.
Bill?
Like you're going to go to fucking Europe.

320
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:34.370
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

321

323
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.710

00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:02.860
big.com,
Promo Code Bar Score,

424
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.400
[inaudible] dot com Promo Code Burp.
All right,

425
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.210
let's talk attempted suicides here,
shall we?
Um,

426
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.000
yesterday a man in a,

427
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:18.060
a green Celtics sweatshirt climbed up the KT,

428
00:26:18.101 --> 00:26:22.150
La,
um,
TV tower.
And,
um,

429
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.100
interestingly enough,
we're writingF is for family,
not too far away.

430
00:26:27.101 --> 00:26:31.380
So we saw the helicopters but couldn't see the guy.
And um,

431
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.590
<v 3>yeah,</v>

432
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.100
<v 0>so out here,
you know,
in La,
they show everything live on the news,</v>

433
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.600
except now when they think somebody's going to die.
So you know,

434
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:44.070
cause a long time ago they showed this guy who was trying to kill

435
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.690
<v 3>himself and he tried to light himself on fire and like just Suzuki Samurai and</v>

436
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.190
it didn't work.
And then he got out of the fucking car,

437
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.310
he had a fucking 12 gauge shotgun.
He got on his knees,

438
00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:56.400
put it under his fucking Chin and blew his fucking head off on TV.

439
00:26:56.401 --> 00:26:57.900
And like kids were home from school.

440
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.000
It happened to like three 30 in the afternoon.
So like,

441
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:02.280
we can't do that shit anymore.
Right.

442
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.280
So what do we do?

443
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:08.790
We put on periscope and God knows there's people fucking film in the shit.

444
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.010
And um,
the dude's up there.
So immediately,
by the way,
he did,

445
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:18.720
he doesn't die.
I wouldn't be doing this if the guy died.
He's fucking up there,

446
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.360
right.
And,
um,

447
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.130
which I think is all a big sign saying that Kevin Durant is going to come to the

448
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:29.940
Celtics.
He's leaving Oklahoma.
All right.

449
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.960
And he's had enough of you wholesome,
racist people out there.

450
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.250
He would like to performance in front of some unwholesome racist people in

451
00:27:38.251 --> 00:27:41.100
Boston.
That's what I feel.
Anyways.

452
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.550
So the guy's climbed up to Katie La Tower.

453
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.750
You're trying to get him down and got a couple of fucking air mattresses or

454
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:53.220
whatever the fuck they put down there.
And uh,
he climbs up and over the five.

455
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.070
And it was amazing.
The guy was up there for three fucking hours.

456
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.063
And I've got to tell you,

457
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.860
I'd be lying to you if I didn't start thinking about survivor because it really

458
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:04.680
seemed like one of their challenges where you always have to stand on like a

459
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:08.730
fucking,
I dunno like a bamboo pole with one foot,
you know,

460
00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.640
balancing a tea cup on your head.
It kind of seemed like that after a while.

461
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:13.770
Like how the fuck could somebody stay up there that long?

462
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.900
And he was up there smoking cigarettes and taking phone calls and shit.
And I'm,

463
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:20.310
all I could think was

464
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.640
<v 0>I was,
if I was going to kill myself,
I would never jump off something.</v>

465
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:27.763
You know what I mean?

466
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.180
There's too much time to think about what you just did on the way down.

467
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.700
Right.
This just,
and it's just no way I even know it's right.

468
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.440
The old right there,
Fred,
it's just immediately fucking over.
It's just the,
the,

469
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.330
the,
the fucking mess.
You know,
it's like,
come on man.
You know,

470
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.300
p so he's got a clean there.
That's,
that's the last thing you do.

471
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.470
Everybody said that you're dead and then you leave a giant fucking mess.

472
00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.240
Somebody's got to come over there with the fucking wet vac and try to clean up

473
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:05.120
the goddamn scenic.
God knows,
you know when you jump off of something,

474
00:29:05.121 --> 00:29:08.800
it's usually not your house.
You know what,

475
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.780
he really has a house big enough to jump off of them.
Die.

476
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.770
You usually land in the grass,
right?

477
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.280
So all you do is just break your fucking legs is some shit and separate your

478
00:29:19.281 --> 00:29:20.480
fucking shoulder.

479
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.880
I'm not saying you can't jump off a house and die,

480
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.730
but I'm just saying,
you know,
you want to make sure you'd die,

481
00:29:28.731 --> 00:29:31.310
which means you're going to go to someplace that's a little higher up,

482
00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:36.260
some sort of public structure with concrete and there's people walking by,

483
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.710
right?
They just,
it's just such a selfish fucking way to do it,
right?

484
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.930
People coming up the damn straight,
you know,
hey,

485
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:48.820
I'm so excited to go see,
um,
everybody wants some,

486
00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:52.810
I wasn't alive in the 80s that I'd like to see Hollywood's version of it,
right?

487
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.480
It just like these last two weeks have just been so wonder if funding just all

488
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:02.800
over the fucking place.
So anyway,
I just get on.

489
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.820
And then the worst part is if you jump and you actually fucking live,

490
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:07.811
you know what I mean?

491
00:30:07.811 --> 00:30:11.110
And then you have your feet appointed in every fucking direction except the way

492
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:13.060
they're supposed to,
you know,

493
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:16.510
and then you got to go around being the inspirational speaker,
you know,

494
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.140
with a specially designed fucking wheelchair,
you know,

495
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:24.010
for somebody who has feet,
you know,
that point every fucking day.
I don't know,

496
00:30:24.011 --> 00:30:25.990
some sort of,
I think he at that point they just have,

497
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.760
they wheel you in like Hannibal Lecter and then you gotta be like,

498
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.650
just standing there,
you know,
with your custom sneakers,

499
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:39.550
talking to some fucking group of people about,
you know,

500
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.690
why you have so much to lose a fucking way to find out that he got so much to

501
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:48.070
live for.
Um,
it's never the fucking answer.

502
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.940
You know what I mean?
Cause his bad,

503
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.440
think about somebody's depressed in Saint Louis is bad as their fucking life is

504
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.910
the Saint Louis Blues made the Western Conference fucking finals.
I mean,
yeah,

505
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.110
if you killed yourself,
you wouldn't have seen that.
You know?

506
00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:08.200
And then you can't go down to the bar.
Everybody's in a good mood.

507
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:08.771
And all of a sudden,

508
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:12.220
some hot chick with the Saint Louis Blues tee shirt tied off at the fucking

509
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:15.310
navel,
comes over,
gives you a hug.
And I go,
wow,

510
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.560
that's what life's all about.

511
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:22.510
Getting a hug from a hot chick and going home and rubbing one out tour.
Ah,

512
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.230
I can't believe I almost jumped off that fucking distillery.

513
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:31.990
You know what I'm trying to say is don't fuck.
I can always don't kill yourself.

514
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.670
All right,
this has been a public service announcement.
I'm going to lie to you.

515
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.340
If I didn't fucking look up,
worst ways to kill yourself.

516
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.280
I found this fucking website.
And uh,

517
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.150
the unfortunate thing was the person tried to be funny rather than just

518
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:46.990
presenting them.

519
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:52.180
They tried to put their own funny spin on it like I'm about to right.
Um,

520
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:56.410
all right,
seven most unusual ways to kill yourself.

521
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.930
Um,
all right.
Number one,
this guy tried to kill himself by eating a bible.

522
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:04.160
The doctor said,
uh,

523
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.830
I was not strong enough to pull the object out of the guy's throat.
Um,

524
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.990
I don't believe that that's true.
I don't believe somebody ate a Bible.

525
00:32:13.991 --> 00:32:18.370
I think that's one of those,
uh,
not the creationists,

526
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:22.270
the other fucking people.
What's the other people there?
I don't fucking know.

527
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.250
If you don't believe in creationism,

528
00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:27.310
you believe in what [inaudible] Big Bang [inaudible] person.

529
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.050
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
the next one,

530
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.390
a guy killed himself in prison by stuffing toilet paper down his throat.

531
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.010
That's how bad prisoners,
you know what I mean?
And uh,
you know,

532
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.590
you ever saw a Shawshank redemption?

533
00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:45.450
That seems like it seems the better way to go in a more pleasing thing to have

534
00:32:45.451 --> 00:32:50.220
in an orifice.
I'm
sorry,

535
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:56.070
number five.
Skying Singapore worked at the zoo wanting to kill himself.

536
00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.780
Natural Way to do it.

537
00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.410
Why take a bunch of sleeping pills and go peacefully when you can walk into the

538
00:33:01.411 --> 00:33:04.860
tiger cage.
I bet that's nice and quick to,
you know,

539
00:33:04.861 --> 00:33:06.360
I've always wanted a pet at target too,

540
00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:09.330
so I think you could get one quick Peden before he fucking grabbed you by your

541
00:33:09.331 --> 00:33:11.850
throat,
gave you a nice shake.
You just go to,

542
00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.520
it's like getting put into the sleeper.
Hold by one of the UFC guys,

543
00:33:14.521 --> 00:33:18.990
except they would do it with their mouth.
Um,
number four,

544
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.340
this woman drank Draino and that's disgusting.

545
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:27.240
That's not a funny one because the one,
a guide to capitated himself,

546
00:33:27.241 --> 00:33:32.100
he got into an Austin Martin tied a rope around his neck,
you know,
did a burnout.

547
00:33:32.101 --> 00:33:35.820
Woo.
That's it.

548
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:41.130
Um,
I guess he was trying to get revenge on his wife.
I don't know how that works.

549
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:42.330
<v 3>Okay.</v>

550
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.790
<v 0>You know what I mean?
Cause it was a lot of the cleaners today.
I don't,</v>

551
00:33:44.791 --> 00:33:47.160
you could literally bleed out in a car like that and they can,

552
00:33:47.161 --> 00:33:50.430
they can get me enough if we see that pimp my ride,

553
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.550
they could take that Austin Martin down there in a fucking day.

554
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:56.880
They had all the materials they could take that interior,
put it back in,

555
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.250
and no one would ever know that you ripped your fucking head off.

556
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.790
Although I wonder what happened to the car.
So he just kept going.

557
00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:03.451
That's another one.

558
00:34:03.451 --> 00:34:05.880
Now what if someone was coming up the street doing the fucking paper route?

559
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.850
No one does a paper anymore.
It's an adult job.
All right.
Um,

560
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.240
it's one guy tried to kill himself.
He had to shoot himself three fucking times.

561
00:34:15.241 --> 00:34:18.840
That's not funny.
Then another guy went out into the woods.

562
00:34:18.841 --> 00:34:22.020
He handcuffed himself to a tree and then through the fucking key away,

563
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.840
and then they could tell that he struggled to try to free himself.
See,

564
00:34:24.841 --> 00:34:25.950
that's why you never do it.

565
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:27.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

566
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.910
<v 0>Nobody ever fucking killed themselves except for a guy in jail.
We just like,</v>

567
00:34:31.911 --> 00:34:32.180
I mean,

568
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.900
I to spend the rest of my life fighting off fucking people trying to stab me a

569
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:39.470
fuck me.
I mean,
that's when you got it.
That's what God's like.
All right.
I get it.

570
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.610
I get it.
No worries.
Die.
You don't got to explain it.
Come on in.

571
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.230
Come on at.
Um,
you did your time.

572
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.610
All right.
I can't end on suicide.
All right,
let's go with a prediction here.

573
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.110
All right.
Um,

574
00:34:56.390 --> 00:35:01.390
tonight having watched zero predators or San Jose sharks games this year,

575
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.770
having watched maybe three minutes of that entire series,

576
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.570
I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt,

577
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.920
no,
I can't pay.
I have not seen it.
I know,

578
00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:16.510
I'm trying to close my eyes and see the winner.

579
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:17.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

580
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.390
<v 0>That I believe that the winner of tonight's gay,</v>

581
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.460
it's gonna be,

582
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:28.870
I'm going to say the predators.

583
00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:33.370
And the reason why I'm saying the president of predators is because the St Louis

584
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:38.370
Blues were the away team and they want in our two home going to lose a game

585
00:35:38.741 --> 00:35:42.940
seven on back to back nights.
Okay.

586
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.970
And that's the type of philosophy right there.

587
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.740
Why Vegas always wins because there's not an ounce of intelligence in what I

588
00:35:50.741 --> 00:35:55.450
just said.
All Right,
I'm picking the predators.
That's it.
Alright.
Oh,

589
00:35:55.451 --> 00:36:00.010
freckles is test to go to the uh,
asked to go to work and uh,

590
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.530
my gym's going to be finished tomorrow.

591
00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:07.531
So starting Saturday call Billy beefcake will be to be going to a town near you

592
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.180
with my overdeveloped freckled Pecs,
right?

593
00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:19.010
All of that type of shit.
My sciatica is going to be cured by then.
Uh,

594
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.980
I just don't sit down anymore.
You know,

595
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.140
that of course that's going to lead to some sort of feet problem.
But,
um,
anyways,

596
00:36:26.141 --> 00:36:29.280
thank you for listening as always.
And,

597
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.780

598
00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:36.730
I'm glad you guys enjoy when my wife comes on a fucking
shits on me.

599
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:40.420
You know,
I actually like it too.
It makes me laugh.

600
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.710
I enjoy it even though she's a pain in the ass.
Uh,
all right,
that's it.

601
00:36:44.711 --> 00:36:46.710
So please enjoy the music and we'll get,

602
00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:51.250
give you another half hour of a classic podcast from a,

603
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.920
from a year going by in a place,
I can't remember.

604
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.990
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

605
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.710
<v 0>Hey,
what's going on?
It's,</v>

606
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:13.310
<v 5>it's the Monday morning podcast that I am doing on Tuesday at 1120 in the</v>

607
00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:18.550
morning,
east coast time.
Fucking believe that.
Well,

608
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:22.860
let me slip it.
You know,
no excuse.
Actually,

609
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:26.140
I do have an excuse.
It was my girlfriend's birthday yesterday.
So,
uh,

610
00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:31.080
I was being a great boyfriend,
paying attention to her and someone had to suffer.

611
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.920
You know what I mean?
It's like a,

612
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:40.510
someone always feels left out,
man,
or how much you try to pay attention.

613
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.280
My kid and I never had a threesome before.
I couldn't have one once.

614
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.563
I think twice.

615
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.920
The first time I didn't realize that it was going down.

616
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:55.900
I was so young and stupid.
I was actually sitting there and I was thinking,

617
00:38:55.901 --> 00:39:00.400
why won't her roommate leave?
You know,
the fuck.

618
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.900
And it wasn't until like literally seven years later I went,
oh,
wait a minute.

619
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:08.140
She wasn't leaving because buck.

620
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.750
And then the other time,
uh,

621
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:15.751
it was right there on the table and one girl was absolutely gorgeous and the

622
00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:21.430
other one,
uh,
was not gorgeous.

623
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.750
Let's put it that way,

624
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.640
was so not gorgeous that she eclipse the beauty of the other one,

625
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.440
you know,
so,
so they go,
hey,

626
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.950
you learn something about me right off the damn bet.
Okay,

627
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.180
well this is what we're going to do this week on the podcast.

628
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:46.940
If you guys are new to this shit,
uh,
new my page.
Um,

629
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.990
I didn't want to use every God damn week and,
uh,

630
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:55.960
people ask me questions and I tried to answer them.
And other than that,
I babble.

631
00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.000
I give you information about my life and uh,

632
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:04.960
and that's it.
I'm fucking out of it or right.
I drank last night.
Okay.

633
00:40:04.961 --> 00:40:05.800
I was celebrating,

634
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:12.250
actually went to this gut them restaurant in New York and went to Bible and I'm

635
00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:17.110
a big fan of Mario Batali,
but I like Uber better.
Baba was just too,

636
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.240
it was too,
uh,
uh,

637
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:23.860
my palate was not sophisticated enough.
All right,

638
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:26.740
I'll take the blame Jesus Christ.

639
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:31.570
It was like regular dishes was shit you'd never read.

640
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:37.210
I had beef cheek,
Ravioli.
Yeah,

641
00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.840
it was once you fucking take that in for a minute.
All right.
And they had,

642
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.110
you know,
they had like pheasants face fucking Lasagna.

643
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.920
It was always like half of what you had heard of like goose liver,

644
00:40:50.921 --> 00:40:55.720
a fucking souffle.
So I dunno,

645
00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.790
it was,
they was good.
But a Lupa is the shift.

646
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.260
That's the one that I liked that's got like a fucking,
you know,

647
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:09.990
regular animal's body parts that you weed mixed in with fucking a Rigatoni.

648
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.030
Oh,
what the fuck are you going to do?
You know,
you try shit.

649
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.650
You know,
she wanted to go there.
I fucking took her there.
And uh,

650
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:27.340
that's what happened
to cupcakes for breakfast.
What are you thinking about that?

651
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.210
It was sitting there,
left over from the party and I said,

652
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:32.560
that's a great way to start my day.

653
00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:36.440
Let me get myself 9,000 calories of straight sugar.

654
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:40.810
It was unreal.
It was like I did an eight ball.
That's right.

655
00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.730
The two cupcakes for 20 minutes.
I was just sitting there thinking,

656
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:47.120
how fucking great I wasn't.
I'm like,
I'm fucking awesome.

657
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.230
I could do anything I fucking the greatest.

658
00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.250
And 20 minutes later when the sugar started wearing off,
oh my God.

659
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:59.770
I started pulling the drapes closed
laying in here like,
uh,

660
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.390
I dunno.
I Dunno.

661
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.260
Don't ever start your day with fucking two cupcakes.

662
00:42:06.261 --> 00:42:09.260
FTE had a beef cheek.

663
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.600
Fucking Ravioli.
Beef cheek.
I was like,
cheek like the ass.
You being cute.

664
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:18.560
They're like,
no,
they actually,
you know what?

665
00:42:18.561 --> 00:42:20.810
I didn't have the fucking balls to ask him.
I didn't want to know.

666
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:24.410
I was eating somebodies face meeting.
A Yak face.
Yeah.

667
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:27.380
Let me get the Yak taint a rag.
Rag Boon.

668
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.690
All right,
let's continue with the,
uh,

669
00:42:31.691 --> 00:42:35.820
the continuing story of American Airlines.
If you listened to my,
uh,

670
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:40.700
my podcast last week,
uh,
these cheap ass motherfuckers at American Airlines,

671
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:44.600
uh,
you know,
the alligator arm,
the fucking food up in first class,

672
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:46.693
you know what I mean?

673
00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.900
They had 20 people in First Class and they made five omelets and next thing you

674
00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:55.730
know,
I was eating a bowl of total
over Nebraska.
Actually,
no,

675
00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:58.640
that's not what happened.
Just to give you a quick synopsis,
I said,

676
00:42:58.641 --> 00:43:00.890
Fuck you Annie.
A honeycomb cereal.

677
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:03.770
This is first class and I don't get a Goddamn Mama.
I don't want anything.

678
00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.960
I said all of that with a little less anger and no curse.
So a few seconds later,

679
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:12.380
the guy came back,
all of a sudden,
magically he has an Omelet.
And I'm like,

680
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:13.280
where did you get that?

681
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.280
And he informed me that the pilot said he already ate so I could have his
omelet.

682
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:22.040
And I was like,
I don't want his fucking Omelet.
I want my omelet.
All right.

683
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:27.380
I don't want to starving pilot.
You know,
passing out up there,

684
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:31.430
seeing bogeys leaning forward on the Goddamn yoke,
whatever you call it.

685
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.363
All right.

686
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:38.710
So I sent them a letter and this is the letter that they sent back to me and I

687
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.071
swear to God,
you know,

688
00:43:40.071 --> 00:43:45.071
back in the day if something like this ever happened and you actually wrote a

689
00:43:45.441 --> 00:43:49.040
letter,
the very least they give you a free airline ticket.
And I'm,

690
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:53.150
when I say back in the day,
I mean like 2005,
2006.

691
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.750
Now they don't give a shit.
They just keep apologizing profusely.

692
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.270
This is a dumb ass letter they sent back to me.

693
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.930
I'm only going to read you part of it because they just keep saying the same

694
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:05.840
thing over and over again.
Okay.
I think I got the hiccups.

695
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:10.040
Like I have sugar hiccups from stuff and down to cupcakes.

696
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.070
Hang on a second.
It's room service.
Hello?
Yeah,

697
00:44:16.071 --> 00:44:18.680
I'm going to check out about like 15 minutes.
Okay.

698
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:24.470
Thank you Jesus.
They didn't say anything.
She said hello?

699
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:26.690
I said,
yeah,
I'm gonna to check out 15 minutes.

700
00:44:26.691 --> 00:44:31.650
At which point she could have said okay or older,
you know.
But no,

701
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:37.090
she just closes the door.
All right.
Okay.
Here's the fucking,

702
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.400
uh,
what,
what have we got here?
This is okay.
This is it.

703
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.750
This is the letter that American Airlines sent me.
Okay,
dear Mister [inaudible],

704
00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.240
thank you for contacting American Airlines.

705
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.470
It's our privilege to respond to your message.
Okay.
First of all,

706
00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.100
right there,
they already pissed me off.
Okay.
Don't,

707
00:44:54.101 --> 00:44:57.790
don't start with off with your fucking stock line.

708
00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:03.910
Like you,
Jackie Gleason,
you know,
thank you for writing as in a way we go,

709
00:45:03.911 --> 00:45:07.270
you know,
a little shemen off the buffalo.
Uh,
okay.

710
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:11.230
I'm very sorry to hear of your disappointment with us and regret that you did

711
00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:14.770
not receive your preferred entree when you traveled with us in the first class

712
00:45:14.771 --> 00:45:17.530
cabin,
uh,
cl solace stasis.

713
00:45:17.531 --> 00:45:21.790
Because we want your travel experience or in premium premium cabins to be truly

714
00:45:21.791 --> 00:45:22.780
something special.

715
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.200
We do our best to cater our entree selections so that we can serve each customer

716
00:45:28.571 --> 00:45:32.890
the entree they prefer.
This is the part which is just complete bullshit.

717
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:37.600
Okay.
They want to make sure that they serve the entree that I prefer.
You know,

718
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.390
you know,
you can do that.
Bringing up fucking eggs on the flight.

719
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.740
This is what they right to do.

720
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.070
So we determined which entrees are selected most often.

721
00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:49.890
It's often and provision accordingly.

722
00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:56.190
That's fucking bullshit.
I mean,

723
00:45:56.191 --> 00:45:59.580
but then they watched Jurassic Park when Jeff Goldbloom did his little rant

724
00:45:59.581 --> 00:46:00.720
about chaos theory.

725
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.600
You think as you take 10 flights or a hundred flights and you figure it out,

726
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:08.580
oh you know,
seven people want the Omelet

727
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.660
and and you know nine people once something else.
It's such bullshit.

728
00:46:13.661 --> 00:46:18.640
First of all,
nobody wants to fucking cereal.
No one wants cereal at first class.

729
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.593
Okay,

730
00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:24.250
you fucking dropped $1,500 or whatever the hell is 800 $1,500 on a ticket.

731
00:46:24.251 --> 00:46:28.240
You want something of substance.
I'm sick of bitching about this.

732
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:31.750
All I know is in the end of it,
I ended up flying fucking a middle seat.

733
00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:36.751
The fucking Dallas and all I got was $150 voucher to pay for one third.

734
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.390
They didn't give me anything.
Mr Barrow,

735
00:46:40.391 --> 00:46:43.660
we are not unmindful of the inconvenience of you.
Well,

736
00:46:43.661 --> 00:46:46.240
how the fuck would you be on mindful?
I wrote,
she had God damn letter.

737
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.800
As hard as we are trying to deliver on respecting your time by operating our

738
00:46:50.801 --> 00:46:54.790
flights is scheduled.
It just wasn't possible this time.
Again,

739
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:59.770
we apologize for the disruption of your travel plans.
We're not giving you shit.

740
00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.870
Please sly with us again soon.

741
00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:07.180
We'll do our best to get you to your destination as plant.

742
00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:10.000
Really,
you're going to do your best.
That's what you can give me.

743
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.450
American Airlines.
Well,
Gee,
you know,
we're going to try.

744
00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.400
That's a comforting attitude to have when they're going to be flying it fucking

745
00:47:18.401 --> 00:47:23.140
36,000 feet off the goddamn ground.
Oh,
do I sound like a cunt this week?

746
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.350
So that's basically it.
That's,
that's the,
uh,

747
00:47:27.351 --> 00:47:30.700
the next level that they've taken it to where it used to be like,
okay,

748
00:47:30.701 --> 00:47:34.600
we fuck you over.
And the stewardess gives you a hand job.
You know,

749
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.160
that was 1975.
Then in the 80s,
it was,
you know,

750
00:47:39.161 --> 00:47:43.780
we'll give you a free ticket and a skinny Michael J.
Fox tie.
But those things,

751
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.171
you know,

752
00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:49.171
when you had the little spiked out mullet and that lasted for a good 20 years

753
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.920
and uh,
somewhere in the last four or five years it became a,

754
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.750
we're going to fuck you over red back.
I'll talk to yourself.

755
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.030
When you think about that.
Go Fuck Yourself.

756
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.150
<v 6>It was</v>

757
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.300
<v 5>299 other people on the plane that didn't fit in complaint.</v>

758
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:05.160
What are you gonna do?
Take the train.

759
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.970
It's going to take him nine days to get to New York.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You know,

760
00:48:08.971 --> 00:48:13.080
you're coming back.
It's just eggs,
you know of yourself.

761
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.920
You know what they got me over God damn barrel sounds a bit just,

762
00:48:16.921 --> 00:48:21.060
what am I going to do?
Flight Ata.
You know Nina fucking,

763
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:27.080
I don't know what in a goddamn chicken from actually I think Ata recently we

764
00:48:27.081 --> 00:48:31.200
went out of business,
give a flying an airline and then you know,
you're like,
Eh,

765
00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:32.760
you know it was kind of weird flight and you know,

766
00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:37.040
there was a crack in the inner window.
Ata.

767
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.040
We wanted the windows,
you know,
they got like,
they got the double pane of glass,

768
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.640
they got the one on the outside,
the outside of the plane,

769
00:48:44.641 --> 00:48:48.390
and then they have the one,
uh,
on the inside,
the extra level one.

770
00:48:48.391 --> 00:48:52.410
And that one was cracked and I believe there's a little bit of water in there.

771
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:56.820
And I said to the,
to the stewardess,
I was like a woman,

772
00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:59.910
there's a fucking crack of the goddamn window over here.

773
00:48:59.911 --> 00:49:03.990
I'm afraid I'm going to get sucked out once we get above 6,000 feet.
She said,

774
00:49:03.991 --> 00:49:06.550
it's like going like glass,

775
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:11.350
you know.
So I didn't feel bad when they went out of business.

776
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.080
Now I kind of felt bad because now there's no,
there's no other option.

777
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.400
I guess that's my other option.

778
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:20.050
Do I sit there and I take it on American Airlines and they go,
go fuck yourself.

779
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:25.270
All right,
we're going to give you a bran muffin.
I hope you brought some water.

780
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.560
Or I fly another airline when their inner window was cracked and no one thinks

781
00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:33.300
it's a concern.
Tanner winners crack.
Well,
that's,

782
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:38.610
that's why they got two of them.
All right,
this,

783
00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.420
this,
this podcast is just a cluster.
Fuck.

784
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.100
Let's get to some podcast questions that I didn't even,

785
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.190
I didn't even have the time to fucking look at this week.
Actually,

786
00:49:48.191 --> 00:49:50.710
that's not true.
I went to look at them and somebody,

787
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:52.630
I don't know what's going on with my myspace page.

788
00:49:52.631 --> 00:49:54.990
I don't know if anybody else has had this problem.
But,
uh,

789
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:59.650
I ended up painting will really add anybody for about a year.
You know,

790
00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:02.950
every couple of days they'll get about 45 requests,
I'll accept them.

791
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:08.350
And then a day later I have 47 people taken off my page.
And it's like,

792
00:50:08.351 --> 00:50:13.350
really?
We're all those people spammers.
I don't know what's going on.
So,
uh,
um,

793
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.990
having somebody looking at my account,
the only question I can remember,

794
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.690
I can't even remember what it was.
Something about fucking,
uh,

795
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:28.040
you know,
what movies do I find scary?
Um,
well,
you know what,

796
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:30.800
if you turned my flight on American Airlines into a movie,

797
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:35.360
I would've found that fucking scary.
Um,
what movies do I find scary?

798
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:39.150
Anything that involves the crazy woman.
Um,

799
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.690
I think the scariest movies,

800
00:50:41.691 --> 00:50:46.691
one of my first got cable and the early eighties when I had a tight jeans and a

801
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.090
pony high tops that just met the bottom of my jeans and no one complained

802
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.920
because somehow you could get away with that back then.
Um,
I remember,
uh,

803
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.180
the first Friday the 13th,
when Jason came up out of the lake,

804
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:07.940
that scared the shit out of me.
And there was another one.
His,
here's one for you.

805
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.430
Okay.
I got a podcast question for you guys.

806
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:16.330
There was a movie I saw late night cable and I can't remember what the fuck it

807
00:51:18.441 --> 00:51:19.274
was,

808
00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:25.140
but it somehow there was somebody skating across the pond in slow motion with an

809
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.500
ax.
And I believe for some reason the,

810
00:51:30.501 --> 00:51:35.060
uh,
the monster I'm picturing is,
is from that.

811
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.090
I know this isn't it,
but it,

812
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:42.270
the picture of my mind is what does that monster book where the wild things are?

813
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.250
You remember what those monsters look like?
In my memory,

814
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:51.050
that's what the monster look like skating across the fucking lake.
Uh,

815
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.770
and I know it isn't that,
but I know somebody,
what are you,
what am I,

816
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:59.660
14 listeners out there has to be a fucking horror horror film.
Uh,

817
00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.580
whatever the flow,
what do you call someone's really into horror films.
Like Geek.

818
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.110
Yeah,
exactly.
A horror film.
Fucking deek.
There was that one.

819
00:52:09.111 --> 00:52:09.944
And uh,

820
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.820
there was another one I was just thinking of and I just sat up and I can't

821
00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:16.010
remember it.
I'm getting fucking age.

822
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:19.070
I literally just moved my brain a little bit.
The thought just went away.

823
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.290
Wait a second.
What the fuck was I just thinking?
Let me lay back down.
Let me see.

824
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:27.500
It would come back to me.
Okay.
I was talking about can we got to go back in time?

825
00:52:27.501 --> 00:52:32.150
You know,
I was talking.
Okay.
The lake,
while things are,

826
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:37.670
see the side of my brain works.
It works linear.
Once I go past the moment,

827
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:40.940
I can't go back.
It's like a fucking traffic jam.

828
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:45.830
What the fuck was I trying to think of?
Ah,

829
00:52:45.831 --> 00:52:50.480
Shit.
I Dunno.
Oh,
I got it.
Bam.
There we go.
Um,

830
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:56.480
dark night of the scarecrow.
I liked the old horror movies.

831
00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.950
Okay,
this is what,
you know what I don't like about new horror movies bid.

832
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.340
They would that CGI shit.
They,

833
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:09.490
they can do so much insane stuff with computers that they forgot how to build

834
00:53:10.821 --> 00:53:15.020
suspense.
The old ones they used,
they used to build it up.

835
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:19.760
They used to build up the moment where the monster was going to jump out at you

836
00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:25.180
because they had to because it was just a guy in a rubber fucking suit,

837
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:29.820
you know what I mean?
But now that they can,
they can,
you know,

838
00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:32.670
they can make it look like God still is stepping on New York.

839
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.230
They forgot how to build to Spence.

840
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:39.150
That's what I don't like about fucking horror movies now.
And that's a,

841
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:44.700
I think Japanese I to know everybody over in Asia seems to know how to fucking

842
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:48.690
do that.
But nobody over here it does even like,
like,
like thrillers,

843
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:54.370
whatever the fuck,
whatever goddamn thriller is like,
Take that,

844
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:58.800
that movie a perfect storm.
They had that goddamn big wave.

845
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.450
That's all they showed in the trailer.

846
00:54:00.451 --> 00:54:02.550
So everybody goes out to run out and see it,

847
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:06.720
and then they don't develop any of the goddamn characters to the point that I

848
00:54:06.721 --> 00:54:11.340
don't give a fuck about anybody in the movie.
So by the end of the movie,

849
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:14.400
I'm actually praying for the wave.

850
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.830
I can't wait for them to kill George Clooney and Mark Walberg and all those

851
00:54:19.831 --> 00:54:22.650
other guys because I don't give a fuck about their characters because if they

852
00:54:22.651 --> 00:54:24.600
haven't done anything to make me give a fuck,

853
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:29.190
they just had a couple people speak in Boston accent and you stick them on a

854
00:54:29.191 --> 00:54:30.780
tugboat and I'm supposed to give a shit.

855
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:34.320
They're going to die trying to get lobster.

856
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.670
I'm just in a bad mood.
I'm going a bad fucking more today.

857
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:43.930
Let you know what it is,
is to God.

858
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:46.740
And don't ever start your day with two fucking cupcakes.

859
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:50.180
It seems like such a great,
I,
you know,
it's such a great idea,
you know,
like,
Ooh,

860
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.530
I'm eight years old.
This is what you'd want to do,

861
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:57.330
but your parents never let you,
you know?
And now I'm 39 and 51 weeks.

862
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.980
Finally the dream that I thought was going to happen,

863
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:07.830
you know?
Oh,
it did happen.
And then it doesn't play out.
Right.
Oh my God.

864
00:55:07.831 --> 00:55:08.880
How did I forget this shit?

865
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:12.180
I know I forgot it because I have fucking two cupcakes with the sugar in my

866
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:16.650
brain.
I actually got a crazy week.
How crazy was it bill?

867
00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.500
Um,
I flew into New York on Wednesday.

868
00:55:20.310 --> 00:55:24.840
I did opie and Anthony and opening Anthony Opie and Anthony show Thursday

869
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:29.310
morning.
Then I did my show at Carolines in New York Thursday night.

870
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.090
I got up Friday morning,
got on a plane,
flew back to la.

871
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.510
I did the guys choice awards on Spike TV and then all these famous people,

872
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.010
they were all cool.
I had a great time.
I met Nikki Sixx.

873
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:49.280
I was way more thrilled and the after party was at the fucking playboy mansion

874
00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:54.470
and I know what you're thinking.
Oh my God.
Playboy fucking mansion.

875
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.960
That must have been unbelievable.
Um,
I quickly realized when I got there,

876
00:55:57.961 --> 00:56:00.330
there's two kinds of parties at the playboy mansion.

877
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.360
There's the your famous and you can come by Wednesday afternoon and actually

878
00:56:05.431 --> 00:56:07.320
meet the broads that are in the magazine.

879
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:11.880
And then there's the one that I went to where it's like,
yeah,

880
00:56:11.881 --> 00:56:14.610
why don't you guys all just stand on my,
in my backyard?

881
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.560
I literally thought I was going to show up to the mansion.
Right.

882
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:24.820
It was going to be like me and eight other people and just,
you know,

883
00:56:24.821 --> 00:56:28.720
for playboy bunnies eat just rubbing on my chest.
Hey there,
big boy.

884
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.760
I heard you're a comedian now.
They just had,
they,
they had the,

885
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:39.550
it was definitely the beats team,
a playboy bunny.
You know,

886
00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:41.860
they had the little bunny suits on and the rabbit here as well.

887
00:56:41.861 --> 00:56:43.660
Let me tell you something.
And they were,
uh,

888
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:48.910
they were grade a hooter girls and he could tell there was three of them who

889
00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:51.430
were clearly being paid to frolic in the pool.

890
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:56.910
And any girl with bunny ears had like nine guys around her was a fucking sausage

891
00:56:57.371 --> 00:57:01.360
fest.
And this is a funny thing.
Nobody was hitting on them.

892
00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:04.840
They was standing there with that fucking cameras out,

893
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.720
taking pictures like,
uh,

894
00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.260
like they were at Disneyland and they ran into Donald Duck or something.

895
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:15.400
It was pathetic.
And uh,
you know,

896
00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:20.500
Hugh Hefner was roped off with his three fucking girlfriends,
83 years old,
man.

897
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:23.230
Got It.
It was the shit that was the only thing I wanted to do.

898
00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:28.150
I just want to go in there and shake his hand and then immediately stick my hand

899
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:33.151
in bleach to get the unbelievable smell of 50 years of pussy off of my hand and

900
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.710
then fly back.
But he was busy.
I understand.

901
00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:43.450
He had to meet a famous fucking people.
So,
uh,
but still was still was shit.

902
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.500
And then I flew back the next day,
six in the fucking morning.

903
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:51.190
I landed in New York at about four 30.
I got my bag,

904
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:55.280
I went over to Caroline and I did three fucking shows,
you know,

905
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:57.250
and then I went out drinking afterwards.

906
00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:01.330
And that's the kind of thing that leads you to be in a country mood on a Tuesday

907
00:58:01.331 --> 00:58:05.530
morning.
You know,
I did all of that and then I ate two cupcakes.
All right,

908
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:10.180
so don't even question my fucking move.
All right.
So,
um,

909
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:14.020
so there you go.
That was my week.
Went to a party at the playboy mansion.

910
00:58:14.021 --> 00:58:18.610
I did stand up on my first award show.
When is it going to be at?
You ask why.

911
00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:23.290
I'll tell you it's going to be on,
on June 22nd.
Um,

912
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:26.180
and I had a great time doing the set even though,
uh,

913
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:31.930
most of the crowd was a pay crowd,
you know,
good looking people,

914
00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:35.400
hot chicks texting each other and I,
God,
what kind of,

915
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:38.280
when this is going to be our bar.
And I said [inaudible],

916
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:42.970
I want to blow Jeremy Pip and it's going to be on June 22nd.

917
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:45.580
And this week coming up this week,

918
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:50.581
I'm going to be at a good night's comedy club in Raleigh,

919
00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:51.430
North Carolina.

920
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:55.520
You can go to [inaudible] dot com and get all the fucking information.
And uh,

921
00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:00.190
later on this month,
I'm going to be the punchline in Atlanta,
Atlanta,

922
00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:02.170
the brothers call it.
And,
uh,

923
00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:05.590
I think that date is June 19th or something like that.
I don't fucking know.

924
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:10.330
I can't get on this hotel internet and I have to check out in 19 fucking
minutes.

925
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:13.260
So I gotta go apologize for,
uh,

926
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:18.190
the podcasts being a day late and a,
forgive my continuous on this podcast.

927
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:21.810
I'm going to blame it on the sugar from the two cupcakes.

928
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:27.810
What a fucking half a fag,
Huh?
Starts the day with two cupcakes.

929
00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:33.750
So they call me Billy to cupcakes.
Cupcake.
