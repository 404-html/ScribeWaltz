1
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:01.740
Okay.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill Burn?
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.980
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.920
Just checking you today.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.210
Hey,
what's going on?
How are you?
It's a really Thursday afternoon.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.760
Um,
I forgot it was Thursday.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.090
Had been so fucking busy doing something that I'm not allowed to announce yet.

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:30.810
And Wink,
wink,
wink,
wink,
wake,
wake,
wake,
wink.
Um,
for whatever can reason.

9
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:35.220
And uh,
my phone shit,
the bed,
my phone,
shit,
the bed,

10
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.160
my fucking bread.
Um,
a phone,
shit,
the bed.
And uh,

11
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.040
so I had to go over to Verizon
and uh,

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.130
see what the fuck was wrong with.
It turns out when I went to old Canada,

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.720
none of our teams are in the playoffs,
but we still have syrup.

14
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.010
Let's all start a fucking riot.
When I went up there,

15
00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:59.450
I didn't have a cell phone plan,

16
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:04.400
so Verizon just decided out of the fucking blue too.

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.440
Um,
I dunno,
just

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.520
<v 0>okay.</v>

19
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.020
<v 1>Put some sort of block on the thing so I wouldn't get some sort of extra
charges,</v>

20
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.020
which I had already resigned myself to getting.
I'm just like,
fuck it.

21
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:17.060
I'm not getting the plan.
I'm up here for three,
four days.

22
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:21.120
I'll have a big cell phone bill.
What do I give a fuck?
I don't give a shit.

23
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.350
You want me to write some numbers on a piece of paper and then you stick it in

24
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.510
the thing and then the numbers show up on the screen.
I mean,

25
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:31.170
that's how much what money means to me at this fucking point.
It's just like,
why?

26
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.470
What?
What are,
what do you want me to write on the little piece of paper?

27
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.310
Who gives a fuck and we put a smiley face in the Zeros.
That's all we're doing.

28
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.350
<v 1>None of us has anything of value.</v>

30
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.300
We just got a bunch of stuff in a fucking hell out.
Jesus.
Bill,

31
00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:49.020
you're going down this road.
I am.
I am going down this road.

32
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.220
How many people do you know have anything?
A fucking piece of silver,

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.560
some gold,
whatever.
It happened to us.
We used to be gentlemen,
right?
I went,

34
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.760
you stayed home.
We rode around on a donkey with a curly cued mustaches.

35
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:08.420
We had a little Satchel,
a fucking gold or some shit.
Right?

36
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.080
Then some bandits would come along and they take it from you,
right?

37
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:15.050
All dressed in green with the fucking,
you know,

38
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:19.130
leotards on all that Robin Hood Shit.
Right.

39
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.060
Then there was some brought up in the tower.
All of that is gone.
It's all gone.

40
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:25.970
No.
Now you work all week.
They give you a little piece of paper.

41
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:27.050
It's got some numbers on it.

42
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.990
You stick it into the ATM and then the numbers show up.
Right.
Goes,
hey,

43
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:35.860
you owe me some money.
I'll write,
I'll write some numbers on a piece of paper.

44
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.690
You Go,
thank you.
You know,

45
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:42.620
it all works until it doesn't.
And then what do you get?
He is going to have you,

46
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.550
you're not gonna have anything.
So anyways.
Yeah.
So I don't give a fuck.
And what,

47
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.120
what do you have any big cell phone bill?
What do I give a shit?

48
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:52.450
If it's more numbers on a piece of paper,
it's,
it's not

49
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.853
<v 0>better.</v>

50
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.620
<v 1>I guess at the end of the day is worth something.
But I,
I just,</v>

51
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.100
I don't give a shit about a high cell phone bill and I don't give a shit about

52
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:08.200
sky miles.
I just don't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?

53
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.300
You don't like when you have some miles with somebody and they go,
oh,
you're,

54
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.670
you better use these,
you better use or they're going to expire.

55
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.320
I always call them up.
You say,
yeah,
I want you to know you can keep them.

56
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.130
I don't need your fucking miles.
Or I take them now,
I don't give a shit.

57
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.320
Stop threatening me with your stupid fucking miles by now.

58
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.970
If I need a plane ticket,
I'll buy one.

59
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.620
Anything to not have to go into your fucking website and figure out where I can

60
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.810
fly with my so called free miles already paid for it.
They're not free.
You can't,

61
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.260
Oh God,
I'm in a mood.
So anyways,
so my phone didn't fucking work,

62
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.930
so when I was,
so I went up there and they put a block on it so I wouldn't,

63
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.790
I have to write a bigger number on a piece of paper and send it to them so they

64
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.690
can stick it in their ATM machine.
And,
uh,
when I came back,

65
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.960
it was still blocked.
So I went over to the Verizon place,

66
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.270
turned out the person who helped me out was a fucking lesson.
Right.

67
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.450
And he's trying to help me fix the phone and what's killing me is his company

68
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.470
did the thing to my phone that's now made my phone fucked up and they can't

69
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:17.650
figure out how to undo it.
And,
uh,
you know,

70
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.210
I tried as long as I could to keep my cool.
I didn't flip out that,

71
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:26.590
but I dropped a couple f bombs.
I'm glad he told me that,
you know,

72
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:30.760
he was a listener of the podcast because,
you know,
if he didn't say that,

73
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:32.080
then I just would have been,
you know,

74
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.580
I wouldn't have been on my best behavior and I would have said fuck a lot more.

75
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.420
Um,
it took me two trips over there because then they were like,
all right,

76
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:43.060
well I think we fixed it.
This is like an hour later.

77
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.560
I think we fixed it and a,
it should,
you know,

78
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:52.480
reboot by tomorrow morning.
So I was like,
I find,
you know,

79
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.230
I get back to the office,
I can't fucking,
you know,
I go to text my lovely wife,

80
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.890
it's not going through.
I'm like,
what the fuck?
So I said,

81
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:01.630
well maybe I'll call her cause I wanted to take the,
uh,

82
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:04.130
the capital's against the fucking fly.

83
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.600
I wanted her to take the game,
you know,
and uh,

84
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.250
I went to call up and it just,

85
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.580
I called her number and it just goes a welcome to Verizon.

86
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.840
Please enter your last four digits of your social security number.

87
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.750
Please enter this by pressing one.

88
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.410
You agree to a two year contract with Verizon.

89
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.120
If you come out early,
we will yellow.
It's upon.
I'm like,
what the fuck is this?

90
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.150
So I,
uh,
he had ended up having to go back to the fucking place and um,

91
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.090
this other guy got on it.
He figured out what the fuck was wrong with it.

92
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.840
So now my phone is fine.
So I've just,
I've had one of those fucking day.

93
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:46.300
So when I was in there I was just thinking,
you know,
and I was just like,

94
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.360
you know,
my can't listen to my music.
And they were like,

95
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.160
oh that's cause it's on the cloud.
And I was like,

96
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:54.670
I never wanted to be on the cloud.
I don't want to be on that fucking thing.

97
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.720
I don't want you guys seeing what the fuck I'm doing.
Leave me alone.

98
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:02.590
I keep opting out of that fucking thing.
But every time I reboot my phone,

99
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.570
it just fucking automatically starts back up or some shit.
You fucking nosy.

100
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.860
Nerdy cunts.

101
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.190
<v 1>They always sit like act on like to do when you were fucking favor.
You know,</v>

103
00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:15.290
someone was telling me that,

104
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.120
that that shit about them sharing your private information.
I,

105
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.730
which I've said the entire fucking time,

106
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.460
that day should get your permission first.

107
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.210
And certainly if they go and resell it,
you ought to get a cut of it.
Right.

108
00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:31.410
I mean it's your personal information too.
They act as a broker of chance.

109
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:35.370
You get a fee,
I guess that's in the US,
the Supreme Court.

110
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.050
That's what somebody told me.

111
00:06:37.051 --> 00:06:40.680
It wasn't a lawyer and I can't even remember who it was.
Um,

112
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.260
so anyways,
so as I'm sitting there,
uh,
his time,
it's,
Time's going by.

113
00:06:46.261 --> 00:06:49.440
I started looking at the flip phones and I was like,
Oh man,
I love these things.

114
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.420
Flip loans were great,
you know,

115
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:55.530
a little fucking size of a hockey but not even the size of a hockey puck right

116
00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:56.580
in your pocket.
You know what I mean?

117
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:59.700
Bullet kill me was they all had a camera on them,
which I don't fucking like,

118
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.650
and I didn't have time to ask.

119
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:04.380
The guy wasn't with you just have a flip phone that has no fucking camera on it

120
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.890
and maybe I'll go back to this and I asked the other guy asked the other guy,

121
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.860
these are all young guys,
right?
Born in the 90s,
right?
So I'm like,

122
00:07:10.861 --> 00:07:14.470
do they still sell iPods?
And he's like,
yeah,

123
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:17.040
the apple store best buy or whatever.
So I say,
fuck it.

124
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.070
I'll just put all my music on the fucking my iPod,

125
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.680
right.
And then I'll just get one of these flip phones.

126
00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:28.470
And I was really trying to think what the fuck I would be missing out on.

127
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.010
It would take me longer to text,
but pictures wouldn't be as good.

128
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:36.250
Who gives a fuck?
My video wouldn't be as good.
Who gives a fuck and a,

129
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.000
you know what the deal breaker was?
The GPS system.

130
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.140
I don't want to go back to having a Tom.
I still have a Thomas Guide,

131
00:07:43.141 --> 00:07:47.010
my fucking Prius.
I don't want to have to go back to look it up.
Shit.
I mean,

132
00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:49.590
as much as I would like to use my brain to do that again,

133
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.050
out of all the things that they've made easier,
um,
I think,
uh,

134
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.950
you know,
I got to give it up as much as,
as,

135
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.570
as a curmudgeon that I am the,
uh,

136
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.220
the fucking thing telling you where to go is great.
You know,

137
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.440
even though I probably already bitched about it on the podcast and that was sort

138
00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:10.500
of the deal breaker.
I was like,
well,
I got,
I got to have one of those.
Right.

139
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.000
I at least got to have that.

140
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.680
I don't want to go back to looking at fucking maps and Shit,
you know?

141
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.790
Although I could figure it out,
most of it,
I dunno.

142
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.320
I think what it would end up happening is not the social aspect of it would be

143
00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:28.170
the business aspect.
I don't do the Uber thing,

144
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.170
so I wouldn't be missing out on that.

145
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.680
And I don't fucking order food that way,
do I?

146
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.320
No,
I don't,
I don't even know what the fuck I have it flow.

147
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:44.230
Is it still a podcast is just me?
Just fucking,
well,

148
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.630
I've always babbled anyways.
Um,
yeah,

149
00:08:48.631 --> 00:08:51.330
I've had a fucking brutal week,
man.
I lost my fucking shit.

150
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.550
Like my temper as never been worse.
It's never worse.

151
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.300
I need to,
I need to fucking relax.

152
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:00.830
<v 0>Okay.</v>

153
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.280
<v 1>Um,
I was working all day and all I wanted was some spaghetti and meatballs.</v>

154
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.190
I got this fucking Italian joint.
They make the homemade noodles,
the meatballs.

155
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.420
A fucking damn good,
you know,
and I just wear a craving for it.
I'm like,

156
00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:12.860
I'm fucking getting that right.

157
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.410
So I get home and I say to my lovely wife,
I go,
Hey,
can you,

158
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.010
can you fucking hit the APP thing that gets the person to go pick up your food?

159
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:23.030
And we'll once again,

160
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.523
<v 0>you know,</v>

161
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.320
<v 1>I once again have faith that this person outside of the food industry is not</v>

162
00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:32.710
going to do anything to this food.
You know?
Have you seen that thing?

163
00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:35.860
The guy in the fucking elevator eating some shit off the top of the pizza.

164
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.910
And of course we call the restaurant.
They don't do it.

165
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.790
Postmate it can you postmate the fucking thing and they're like,
oh,

166
00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:48.400
we don't do that over here.
We're a real restaurant.
So like,
all right,

167
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.070
well before we put in the order,
my wife wanted some white fish.

168
00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:52.060
I'm going to get to spaghetti.

169
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.370
So I fucking drive over there and jammed pack with people.
I'd go,
yeah,

170
00:09:57.371 --> 00:09:58.450
hey,
a pickup order.

171
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.540
<v 3>She goes,
oh,
is that Fenin spaghetti in a white fish?
I was like,
yeah,
it was.</v>

172
00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:05.180
She's like,
oh,
we ran out of fish.

173
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.830
<v 0>Okay,</v>

174
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.980
<v 3>so I didn't put it in.
Did you still want this spaghetti?</v>

175
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.043
<v 0>Yep.</v>

176
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.810
<v 1>And I swear to God,
man.</v>

177
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

178
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.980
<v 1>I'd just like we fucking call 10 minutes ago,</v>

179
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.450
it took you 10 minutes to figure out you're out of fish.
I just said,

180
00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:24.860
you know what,
hang on a second.

181
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:29.570
Because I knew I was going to snap and I just walked out of the restaurant and

182
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:33.020
the second I got outside I just started cock sucking motherfucker.

183
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.980
The fuck is to take the fucking Goddamn fucking forget.
Just slipping out.
Right?

184
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.640
Wasn't screaming,
just cock sucking that type of shit right.
Far Away.

185
00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:41.810
You'd think I was speaking German,

186
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.010
fascist cock sucking motherfucker.
Right.

187
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.270
And I heard these two people,
those people are eating outside.

188
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.580
They started laughing at me,
right?

189
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.030
And I didn't give a shit and I just kept my fucking and then got my Prius and

190
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.440
just glided away.
Just

191
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.400
made a complete and utter fucking fool of myself.

192
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.060
Complete and utter fucking fool of myself.
And um,
you know,

193
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:11.410
I go to these great periods.

194
00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:14.020
It's almost like my cigar smoke and just go through these great periods where

195
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:16.390
I'm just not,
I got an under control.

196
00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:18.580
I got it under control and then it just slowly,

197
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.723
<v 0>you know,</v>

198
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.500
<v 1>spins out of control.
And right now,
you know,
I'm not smoking a lot.</v>

199
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.350
I'm drinking a little bit,
but nothing crazy.

200
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:30.240
I think I have everything under control and just something has to,

201
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.200
something's got to give.
You know what I mean?
It's like he'd give up smoking,

202
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.430
eat like a fucking pig,

203
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.313
<v 0>you know?</v>

204
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.920
<v 1>I don't know.
You start working out.
There's always something.</v>

205
00:11:38.921 --> 00:11:41.890
Just got to balance it out.
I've used these fucking people that are nothing but

206
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.090
do gooders I mean,
I don't know.
Maybe they'll robots.
I don't know what,

207
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.330
what they are or maybe they just never exposed themselves to fun shit.

208
00:11:49.331 --> 00:11:51.190
But for the love of God,
I can't do it.

209
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.220
I cannot 100% just be a decent human being.
I don't think it's a,

210
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.530
I don't think it's possible.
I have too much free time.
Maybe that's what it is.

211
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.680
Well,
maybe I'm just a piece of shit and I'm looking for an excuse.

212
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.660
I don't fucking know.
But,
um,
anyways,

213
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.570
I haven't been able to work out as much as I want to.

214
00:12:12.571 --> 00:12:16.020
I think that Burns off a lot of the bullshit.
But uh,
anyways,
speaking of which,

215
00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:19.820
the gym,
the gym,
the gym,
the gym's getting a,

216
00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:23.570
I get the floor put in Friday.
It's a three day process.

217
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.370
It's a poxy floor.
It's sort of the,
uh,
they call it a lab.
The lava flow.

218
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.190
It's,

219
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.170
it's really fucking cool looking or it's going to look out of style and fucking

220
00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:37.420
three days.
I don't know what,
but uh,
I did go with the gray was sort of a black,

221
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.690
black and tinge to it,

222
00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:42.570
so I Nice muted fucking color and uh,

223
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.560
Nia told me to get a mirror in there,
you know,

224
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.130
cause she wants to look at her form when she's doing whatever the hell she's

225
00:12:49.131 --> 00:12:51.860
doing.
I don't know what she's going to be doing.
She wants to look at a form.

226
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.970
I don't use gyms for my form.
I just mirrors,

227
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:58.190
I'm should say I never used those for my form.

228
00:12:58.191 --> 00:13:02.450
I wait until after I'm done lifting.
And then I used a marriage of flection.

229
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.960
I just walk over and go,
you're right.
That's all I use it for.

230
00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.320
Why?
There's always does going to be a lot of breadth marks on my,
uh,

231
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.720
my fucking mirror.
Um,
I can't fucking wait.

232
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.280
And,
um,
so my goal is every day before work,

233
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:24.680
this thing I'm working on that I'm not allowed to talk about,
um,

234
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.060
is I'm going to work out in the morning,
take my dog for a hike,

235
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:29.200
I'm going to work out in the morning,

236
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:32.200
and then I'm going to put in a solid fucking day.
And at the end of the day,

237
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.040
I'm going to come home.

238
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.790
Daddy's going to have a little Bingo Bango and I'm going to talk to my lovely

239
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:40.890
wife and I'm going to go to bed.
That's what my life's going to be like.
Um,

240
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.720
that is the goal.
Anyways.
You know.

241
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.040
So this contractor that I have working on this thing,
yeah.

242
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.290
Unlike my last one is a fucking guys,
right.
As ranked.

243
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.810
So,
uh,
it's been,
it's been a fucking wonderful thing.
However,

244
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:59.780
let's stop talking about this bullshit.
All right.
Um,

245
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.200
how about the fucking NHL playoffs?
Playoffs.
Oh,
first of all,

246
00:14:05.201 --> 00:14:08.890
congratulations to the Golden State Warriors.

247
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:13.630
73 fucking wins.
73 and nine.

248
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.930
I got to tell you,
I don't know.
It took 20 years for someone to beat 72.

249
00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:21.520
Do you think somebody ever beats,

250
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.420
I mean they had single digit loss for the season.

251
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.580
That's fucking unbelievable.
That's,
that's about as borderline on Bree.

252
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:35.560
I think that that really,
um,
well,
you know,

253
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:37.270
so I don't know enough about who Paul,
who had,

254
00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:40.690
who had the record before the bowls,
like how long those records last.

255
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.020
I'm 73 and nine.
That's,

256
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:49.050
that's going to be a tough one if basically the not even the 96 bulls won that

257
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:53.770
many fucking games.
Um,
but I,
you know,
those guys,

258
00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:55.420
if you had that carrot dangling in front of them,

259
00:14:55.421 --> 00:14:57.320
they'd somehow fucking figured out how to win 70.

260
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:02.170
If somebodies got to go 74 and eight,
I don't know that you can do that.
Um,

261
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.720
and I don't know that I know all the rules of basketball either.

262
00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:06.940
So take that with a giant grain of salt.

263
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.713
<v 0>MMM.</v>

264
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.930
<v 1>Congratulations to them.</v>

265
00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:14.650
And congratulations to Colby Bryant Hall of fame career,

266
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.970
going out with 60 points on 50 shots,
which I thought was perfect.

267
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.840
You never considered your teammates your entire career.

268
00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:24.400
Why would you do it on your last night?

269
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:26.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

270
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.560
<v 1>Was perfect way you went out.
And I love that Nike Commercial,</v>

271
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.270
the Nike commercial where he stands in the middle of the court and the Celtic

272
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:39.800
fans,
really an actor in Celtic gear gets up and start singing to him.

273
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.690
I just,
and all the fans around the league or singing how they hate them,

274
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:46.970
but they really love him and respect him.

275
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:50.060
And there's no other teammates knowing the Lakers.

276
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.320
No fucking nod to the past and fucking magic.
And Kareem,

277
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.620
no thanks Phil Jackson.
No nothing.

278
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.060
Just Colby standing in the middle of the court in the fucking Christ pose with

279
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:06.470
this fucking arms out.
And it was absolutely fucking perfect.

280
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:08.750
Great job.
Nike.
Great fucking job.

281
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:10.453
<v 0>MMM.</v>

282
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.250
<v 1>One of the greatest one-on-one fucking players you're ever going to see.</v>

283
00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:17.340
One of the greatest outside shooters you ever going to see?
Uh,

284
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.780
one of the biggest cancers in a locker room that ever fucking existed more.

285
00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:25.860
He was sort of the second coming of Wilt Chamberlain as far as the stuck points

286
00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:30.240
that he scored versus what the fuck he did in the locker room.
And

287
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.250
I just thought it was fucking party took 50 fucking shots.

288
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.560
<v 0>Ah,</v>

289
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.310
<v 1>I don't think it could have been any more perfect.
That was just,</v>

290
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:47.390
it was phenomenal and it was,
that is Colby takes 50 shots.
He had noise.

291
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:50.120
You Buddy score 60 points.
You know what I mean?

292
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.590
I honestly think that I could've played on a lot of those Laker teams because
he,

293
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.540
you know,
he's not going to throw it to you anyways.

294
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.120
I could have run up down the court,
my fucking pasty legs.

295
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:04.220
How bad would my pasty thighs look in those fucking golden uniforms?

296
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.733
<v 0>Ugh.</v>

297
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.650
<v 1>Unbelievable.
Or even worse than when they had those white ones there for awhile.</v>

298
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.250
The home white ones,
it just be like,
I dunno,

299
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.230
you'd have that little bit of fringe to kind of bring it to at the end of it to

300
00:17:19.231 --> 00:17:23.850
break up the shorts and my fucking milk size and then maybe I had some socks so

301
00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:25.750
I don't fuck,
I don't know.
Chase is the,

302
00:17:25.751 --> 00:17:30.560

361
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:13.750
violated?
Is it the pushy salespeople?

362
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.350
Is that the homeless guy who just walked in off the street and rolled his head

363
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:22.150
around the pillows,
the fake President Day sale or the fact that you know,

364
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:27.151

385
00:22:42.011 --> 00:22:46.560
they ship it back and whoever made the thing in the sweatshop gets executed and

386
00:22:46.561 --> 00:22:49.570
then they fall onto the mattress and they fold them up and throw them in the

387
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:52.640
ocean.
That's what's really going on behind the seats.

388
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.100
If you do love your new helix mattress,
keep it and your and your dignity.

389
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.010
That's why everyone from Gq magazines to Forbes,

Um,

396
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.570
23 more fucking minutes.
Oh,
I was driving home today.

397
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.830
Bududa Lou dude,

398
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:31.570
and somebody in front of me was smoking a cigar and I had my phone,
my head,

399
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:35.230
my window down just a little bit.
This is how much this habit has me.
I was like,

400
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.810
oh my God.
And I rolled it all the way down.
I was like,
yeah,
go ahead,

401
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.610
dog sticks a 10 out the window or ace Ventura.
That's what I was doing,

402
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:45.470
driver behind the guy and I was trying to figure it and I drove up next to him

403
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:48.470
going like,
wow,
the fun guy smoking a cigar and that nice car,

404
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.430
that's some old school shit.
And they pulled up and it wasn't him and um,

405
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.343
I couldn't,
you know,

406
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.070
I couldn't figure out who was smoking the cigar and I realized that cigar smoke

407
00:23:58.071 --> 00:23:59.540
is so fucking stinky.

408
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.080
It could have literally just been like three people smoking on a porch and I

409
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:06.030
drove by and God damn it,
I miss it.

410
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.380
I Dunno if this is a good idea,
you guys,

411
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:12.950
this whole fucking two cigars a month because this is like when I try to go easy

412
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:15.260
with the booze and you know,
when I go,

413
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.500
when I tried to take long periods of time off from boozing,

414
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.710
it doesn't make me go,
you know what?
I don't think,
I don't think I miss drinking.

415
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:25.070
I don't ever need to drink again.
What?
It makes me feel like is,
you know,

416
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.450
I would like to drink a case of beer by myself and see if I can finish a fifth

417
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:31.190
object Jack annual.
That's what it makes me feel like.

418
00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:35.240
So I think I need to feed the beast a little bit.
Um,

419
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:37.730
having said that,

420
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.980
until I drove her home behind the person smoking that unbelievably wonderful

421
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:47.810
smelling cigar,
I um,
I was actually going like,

422
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:50.420
you know what?
I think I can make it to my birthday,
which is in June.

423
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.800
And if I didn't do that then I would be how many?
I smoked this year too,

424
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:59.560
for six and a half.
Six and a half.

425
00:24:59.561 --> 00:25:02.060
Cause won't when I smoked half and it wasn't smoking well,
so we,

426
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.070
I still count that one.
So six and a half.

427
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.760
That would be June and I would be looking at like,
I'd smoked about one a month.

428
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.650
Right.
I think that'd be all right.
I think that would be okay.

429
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:14.690
You know,
actually in reality,

430
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:18.470
couldn't you just do heroin once a month if he just did heroin once a month,

431
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:22.040
12 times a fucking year?
If he didn't do it 12 days in a row,
six days in a row.

432
00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:25.640
So it didn't get you,
you just did it.
That's what they ought to have.

433
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.300
They ought to just have like the heroin spot,

434
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.370
right?
And you got to fucking punch card.
There's no way to falsify it.

435
00:25:34.371 --> 00:25:38.360
No way to sell somebody else's or whatever.
And just once a month,

436
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.170
like what you try it just to see what it was like.

437
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.680
If there was just fucking heroin,
you could go,

438
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.640
you could fucking try it and no matter how bad and if you just like,

439
00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:52.490
I just wanted to do it once just to see what it felt like.

440
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.100
And then you just walk away and you never do it again.

441
00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.590
Or if like you can't,
you liked it.
Right?

442
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.440
Which why wouldn't ya?
I heard it's like the greatest feeling ever.
Right?

443
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.950
Why if they,
if they fucking managed it for you,

444
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.120
he just had that fucking itch and there was just nothing you could do about it.

445
00:26:11.121 --> 00:26:15.470
And then once a month you go and you shoot up,
it's fucking awesome.

446
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.050
And everybody can be excited,
like coming up,
you know?
And,

447
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.530
and they have like a,
like a,
every,

448
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:25.820
the beginning of every month they'd have like a Raffle,
right?
Like,
like,

449
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.240
um,
what do you call it?
The lottery.

450
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.460
And instead of like nine balls coming out,
it's just one ball.
Right.

451
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.450
And it just comes out,
right?
It comes out our right month.

452
00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:40.550
April,
heroin day.
Yes.

453
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.900
The seventeeth seventh that was like,
ah,
fuck 17 died.

454
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.530
The everybody does smack on the 17th.
Except for people that,
you know,

455
00:26:50.531 --> 00:26:52.750
got to keep like reactor's going and shit like that.

456
00:26:52.751 --> 00:26:57.700
They get to do it on like the 18th provided this someone then some would be hung

457
00:26:57.701 --> 00:27:01.420
over from heroin or whatever the fuck he can.
I don't know.

458
00:27:01.421 --> 00:27:04.870
We'd have to work that out.
Catchers have heroin one day,

459
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:11.530
you don't,
once a week,
everybody just gets fucked up.
And you can opt out,
right?

460
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.700
Once a month you do heroin and then you have like,
you know,

461
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.870
booze and days.
It's gotta be a way to do it.

462
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:21.431
Well,

463
00:27:21.431 --> 00:27:26.431
the government just becomes a big fucking drug dealing babysitter now.

464
00:27:26.681 --> 00:27:28.270
But the Hue,
imagine the fucking lines in.

465
00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:30.010
If everybody's got a good head that doesn't work.

466
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:34.090
I guess you got to manage it yourself.
I guess that is the problem.

467
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.210
You know the government won't step in that.
You know what?

468
00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.820
They can't collect enough money off of these super rich fucking people.

469
00:27:39.821 --> 00:27:40.421
That's what it is.

470
00:27:40.421 --> 00:27:43.150
They get the money outside the country and then you've got too many other people

471
00:27:43.151 --> 00:27:45.760
sitting around their sweatpants and they don't want to fucking work,
you know,

472
00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.980
and then fucking,
you know,
regular people,

473
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.320
regular people like us write down the fucking metal.

474
00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.920
I'm going to say everybody listen to this podcast is regular somewhere.

475
00:27:53.921 --> 00:27:58.840
Somewhere right in the middle,
Huh?
Pay In taxes out the fucking ass,
aren't ya?

476
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.940
Ah,
Shane's.
You get heroin once a month,
once a month.

477
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.380
The heroin store,

478
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.430
that's what they should do for the middle class is getting squeezed out.

479
00:28:09.431 --> 00:28:13.750
You just once a month,
they shoot you up once every couple of months.

480
00:28:13.751 --> 00:28:17.650
You get to decide,
but no more than once a month.
You know,

481
00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.440
you do it on a say,
right?
You're just fucking nod off and that's it.

482
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.940
One night's fucking dose.

483
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.210
And then I don't know what you shiver and shake a little bit.

484
00:28:28.211 --> 00:28:31.870
Eat some fucking Jeb one dose.
She not going to get hooked on you.
You know what?

485
00:28:31.871 --> 00:28:35.530
I got to look this up.
Heroin once a month.

486
00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.950
Hey,
little girl,
do some heroin once a fucking month.

487
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.950
I don't think you'll get addicted.

488
00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.440
I always spelled this wrong,
by the way.
No e on it.
No heroes here.

489
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.400
Heroin once a month.

490
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.740
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

491
00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:01.600
<v 1>Heroin Rehab,
treatment opinions.
Can the use of heroin be casual?</v>

492
00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.110
This is the beginning of a life changing decision right here.

493
00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.070
Can you use heroin?
Okay.
You know,
and all of us too.
It's a chat room.

494
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.830
Okay?
It seems from all government propaganda,
don't we love it?

495
00:29:17.831 --> 00:29:22.300
And most threads and discussions here on whatever this is that heroin is for

496
00:29:22.301 --> 00:29:23.380
addicts and junkies.

497
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:28.650
Is it the case that one can take heroin for a one time experiment slash

498
00:29:29.021 --> 00:29:33.910
experience in order to witness the effects?
Uh,
please share.

499
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.730
Um,
that's not a good word to use in a heroin chat room off.

500
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:43.520
Please share experiences with each,
with one time users versus long time.

501
00:29:43.521 --> 00:29:44.151
All right?
Yes,

502
00:29:44.151 --> 00:29:49.040
there are people who will use heroin once or a few times and will not return to

503
00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:52.760
it.
Usually it takes two or more tries to really enjoy it.

504
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:58.030
First time users usually feel a bit nauseous or used tobacco in the day this was

505
00:29:58.131 --> 00:30:01.310
smoking.
This means you will not be a fuck you.
Fuck you.

506
00:30:01.311 --> 00:30:05.720
You're just some regular person.
I want a doctor,
uh,

507
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:10.490
answers.
Let's go to answers.yahoo.com.

508
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.363
<v 0>Come on.</v>

509
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.330
<v 1>Come on,
load.
There we go.
Is it,</v>

510
00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:20.010
can you use heroin one time a best answer capitol?

511
00:30:20.011 --> 00:30:24.720
No,
not at all.
I'm a retired heroin dealer.

512
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.980
I know what happened to my customers when they tried to only use it casually

513
00:30:28.981 --> 00:30:32.850
when they were partying.
They became addicted.
Their lives became miserable.

514
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.740
A lot of them ended up homeless in jail,
losing jobs,
flunking out of college.

515
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:39.570
While I profited off them.

516
00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:42.510
Let's see if that comes in here and any other bad luck he could think of.

517
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:44.760
Their families ended up being prostitutes.

518
00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:49.500
Heroin use is completely miserable life and there's no way to use it
responsibly.

519
00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:53.820
People can become addicted to heroin the first time they use it and try it,

520
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.170
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
This other person said,
it's very,
very unlikely.

521
00:30:58.171 --> 00:31:03.120
I'm a foreign heroin addict who's in a Methadone program right now and you're in

522
00:31:03.121 --> 00:31:06.030
a chat room.
Fucking multitasking.
Now the person,

523
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:10.110
it may be possible for some personalities.
Is it worth the risk?

524
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.940
What is the benefit to gain?
Somebody says,
don't know,

525
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.380
go roll up a fatty.
What was that movie where Alan are,

526
00:31:19.381 --> 00:31:21.630
could just started using heroin when he was like 80.

527
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.350
If I were to shoot heroin once a week for the rest of my life.

528
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:32.540
I see here,
this is on reddit.
This is the last one.

529
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.370
Hypothetical,
of course.
Never done it.
A Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

530
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.840
I'm interested in the effects.
Suppose I shut up a purely and safe,

531
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:45.610
safely measured dose every Friday.
Where would you get that from?
A drug dealer.

532
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.100
I mean,
it's not regulated.
All right.
You know what?

533
00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:52.750
This is probably one of the dumbest questions I've ever asked and mercifully the

534
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.000
half hour is over.
Um,
so don't do it.
People.

535
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.450
I ain't know shit that I've never heard the expression recreational heroin,

536
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.410
heroin user,

537
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.470
although God knows somebody who's going to write in and claim that they could do

538
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:08.800
it.
So you know what more power to you,
but I would never fuck with that.
Anyways,

539
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.340
this has been the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

540
00:32:12.341 --> 00:32:16.330
Just checking in audio.
Um,

And uh,

541
00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.410
then I dunno,
we got some classic kits from Monday morning.

542
00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:24.270
Podcasts gone by.
Have a great weekend.
You Con uh,

543

congratulations to the penguins one in their first one.

544
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:30.860
Congratulations to the Saint Louis Blues.

545
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.280
May Be in Saint Louis.

546

547
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.150

552
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.020
You met some woman's said,

554
00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.350
Why don't you meet me in St Louis Louis and meet me?
At the fair,

555

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.950
<v 4>Hey,
what's going on the Monday morning?</v>

561
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.780
And I'm doing it on Tuesday because

562
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.760
I did one yesterday and I was in the,

563
00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:53.680
I was in an airport again and a,
and just suck.
That's what happened.

564
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.690
It started off good.
You know what I mean?

565
00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:00.320
And then it was like evil Knievel when he was jumping the snake river,
you know,

566
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.960
and they fucking,
they let them off,
you know,
and he went across,
you're like,

567
00:35:04.961 --> 00:35:07.040
Holy Shit,
he's going to make it the past.

568
00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.730
She came out and he just fucking went straight down.
So that's what happened.

569
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.630
He went right into the fucking river and somehow all he got was a bloody nose.

570
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:18.580
Um,
that's what happened to me yesterday.
I went to do the podcast,

571
00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.840
um,
as I was waiting to get on my jet blue flight,

572
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:27.760
exit row is all set,
everything was great.
And,
uh,

573
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.180
you know,
all of a sudden they said that we were switching planes.

574
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.730
We had to get off the fucking plane.
That's what happened.

575
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:36.280
Then I was in the terminal and then I was pissing in an airport again.

576
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:40.890
And how many have I done that on my podcast?
Oh,
I'm bill Burr,
I'm in an airport.

577
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:42.990
I'm not happy.
You know what I mean?

578
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.570
Did he really want to fucking hear that story again?

579
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:51.300
And a saas getting self conscious about that.
That's what happened.

580
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.400
Now that that's the real thing.
That's what happened.

581
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:55.290
Then I got self conscious about it,

582
00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.000
which made me lose my train of thought and the whole thing lost it's fucking

583
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:01.710
momentum in the whole podcast.

584
00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:05.160
Went right down to the snake river and that's what happened.
Okay.

585
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.810
And my nose is bleeding on the plane and everybody thought I was doing coke and

586
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:13.020
I was trying to say that I wasn't.
And then the stewardess was just like,

587
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:15.420
is there a problem sir?
Is there a problem?
You know,

588
00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:19.290
she waived the Patriot Act in my face.
Um,
all right.

589
00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.370
So anyways,
uh,
this bill Burroughs I mentioned at the top of the poor,
cursed,
um,

590
00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.410
it's,
you're new to my page.
I do one of these every single Monday.
All right.

591
00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:31.500
And I have to think that somebody is new to my page because a,

592
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:35.040
I had my big fancy special,
uh,
Sunday night.

593
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.490
Why do I do this on comedy central?
And if I had half a brain,

594
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.520
I could give you some times as to when it's going to be replaying again,

595
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.930
which of course,
I don't know.
But,
um,

596
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.710
I watched three seconds of it cause I can't stand looking at myself.

597
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.610
And I thought it looked fucking awesome and,
uh,

598
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:54.750
I was happy with it and I want to,

599
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.420
before I get into my bitch and for the week and all that shit,

600
00:36:57.421 --> 00:37:00.360
which I really can't because I'm a really happy about my special,

601
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.160
so there won't be a lot of bitching.
I shouldn't have said that because then,

602
00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:06.870
you know,
by the end of this thing will be fucking bitching about something.
But,

603
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:09.780
um,
I just want to thank everybody who,
uh,

604
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.810
sent me emails telling me how much they liked it.
Uh,
uh,

605
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.990
that really means a lot to me.
And I got to tell you something,
man,

606
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.560
I don't know about other comics,
but I freak right before those things come out.

607
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.220
You know what I mean?
I sit there thinking like,
oh my God,

608
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:25.740
what if everybody thinks it sucks?
And I'm like,
no,
no,
I'll do it.
It's good.

609
00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:28.720
It's good.
Right?
You liked it.
You saw it.
And I know have a little,
what if,

610
00:37:28.721 --> 00:37:31.110
what if people are fucking,
I stopped playing that mental tenants,
you know,

611
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:33.510
as I'm standing in a Blimpie or a subway,

612
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.230
trying to think what kind of bread I want to get when it's really all the same

613
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:41.040
kind of fucking bread.
I like how they got that little fucking little oven.

614
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:45.630
They're like,
they're like,
it's the old country,
like you're in Europe.
Oh Wow.

615
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:50.010
And they're baking bread there and say,
ah,
it's just such a fucking scam.

616
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.030
Look at me.
I'm already pitching now.
Let's keep it happy.
Keep it happy.
So yeah.

617
00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:57.060
So basically,
yeah,
it was kind of freaking,
you know,

618
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.980
you want people to like what you do.
And,
uh,

619
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:05.550
if I liked who I was as a person and I was comfortable with myself,

620
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:09.600
I would have no need to get on a stage and act like a jackass for a fucking hour

621
00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:14.220
for other people's approval that I've never even met.
Okay.
So they go,
so that,

622
00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:17.430
so anybody who was going to ask me that question like,
do,

623
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.840
do you live free or die?
Right.
The four,
you have like a special coming out,
like,

624
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:26.010
you know what I mean?
Like totally rolling on the floor,
laughing my ass off.

625
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.170
Uh,
yes.
Yes I do.

626
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.330
I do like totally fucking freak out.
Um,

627
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.480
all right.
Okay.
So anyways,
before I get going here with the podcast,

628
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:40.600
which is a day late and hopefully not a dollar short,

629
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.620
I apologize to all my regular listeners,
all 14.
Are you?

630
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.350
Um,
you know,
it stops.

631
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.880
I got a bunch of friend requests and I thought I was finally going to be able to

632
00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:53.881
get up past fucking 28,000 and I added everybody and I was 28,992 I wanted to

633
00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:00.430
get to 29,000.
Got Damn.
Man,
I swear to God,

634
00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:03.760
there's a fucking conspiracy here and you know it is.

635
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:07.390
It's the fucking Rothschild's family and they're all over Facebook and I'm

636
00:39:07.391 --> 00:39:09.580
telling you that's the scam.

637
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.600
That's the new scam and it's time few people to fucking wake up and realize

638
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.610
that's your social networking.

639
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.360
Internet rights and freedoms are being taken away from you.

640
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.790
I'm Joe Biden.
You know,
I don't even know who Joe Biden is.

641
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.040
I've just been hearing his name in the background,
kind of like,

642
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:30.220
he's like the Jonas brothers and my cultural worlds.

643
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.930
Like every time I walk by a magazine,

644
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:36.810
it's either his face or the Jonas brothers and I don't know either one of their

645
00:39:36.811 --> 00:39:39.760
material at the Jonas brothers started,

646
00:39:39.761 --> 00:39:44.620
started singing a speech of Joe Biden and you told me that that was a number one

647
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:47.020
hit and teenage girls loved it.
I'd have to agree with you.

648
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.730
Those Jonas brothers,
it really wear tight clothes,
don't they?

649
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.950
Is that what the hair is so curly.
Thank you.
Oh right.

650
00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:00.220
There's one for you and his little monologue joke for you.
They really do.

651
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:01.480
They just look really chunky,

652
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.970
like they're going to be fat fucks when they get older.
You know what I mean?

653
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:06.850
Which be hilarious.
Not like they going to be obese,

654
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:09.130
but they're going to have that fat middle aged face.

655
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.850
And that's the big thing that nobody talks about when you get middle age like
me,

656
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.990
is trying not to have a fat porky pig face.

657
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.880
It's the weirdest thing.
Even if you're in shape,
you still get that,

658
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.410
that fucking swollen head,
the cheek,

659
00:40:24.411 --> 00:40:26.290
she get the Winston Churchill face,

660
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.570
you know jolly.
You get the jolly rosy cheeks.

661
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:36.160
You know what it is?
It's the booze man.
It's the fucking booze,

662
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.690
which I have laid off for a about two and a half weeks.

663
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:45.490
I've had a beer and a half at a half a beer at a,

664
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:50.200
uh,
the uninformed taping that I did with Joe to Rosa,
my XM radio show.

665
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.510
I had half a beer at that.
And let me tell you something.

666
00:40:53.511 --> 00:40:55.540
And you stopped drinking beer for two weeks and you drink,

667
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.010
you take a sip of a beer.
Uh,

668
00:40:57.011 --> 00:41:00.670
it's one of the greatest things you've ever tasted in your life.
It's delicious.

669
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:04.840
Like you ever watch Shawshank redemption and not Tim Robbins when he's sitting

670
00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:07.300
on the roof and he gives that,

671
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:12.310
that Conti fucking gorilla maniac guard tax advice and all he wants is some suds

672
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.610
as he talks about.
He talks about just the way he described sitting on that roof.

673
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.270
I guess it's Morgan Freeman's character describes drinking that beer that always

674
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:25.780
makes me want to drink a fucking beer.
You know,
just drink a 12 pack.

675
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:29.230
There is a fucking fly in my apartment that he doesn't realize it,

676
00:41:29.231 --> 00:41:33.980
but his life is ending today.
You know what I mean?
I hate being like that,

677
00:41:33.981 --> 00:41:37.490
you know?
I know it's just the fucking insect and shit and you know,

678
00:41:37.491 --> 00:41:41.480
you kill this and then all of a sudden the bees start dropping off.
But he's,

679
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.220
he's fucking obnoxious.

680
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:47.120
You don't want to have a house fly in and spending your house for a couple of

681
00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.420
days.
You know,
he started,
you know,

682
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.100
he's kind of like an athlete and the toilet twilight of his career.

683
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.570
It's like Brett Farve and the jets.

684
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.100
You know it's exactly that motherfucker sitting right.
Then let's try to kill,

685
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:02.090
this is the first time I ever tried to kill a sly right on my podcast and see on

686
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:03.240
the inside.
This is a big thing.

687
00:42:03.241 --> 00:42:06.770
You don't know if this is it on the inside or the outside.
All right,
one,
two,

688
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.250
three.
Okay,

689
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.530
motherfucker.
I got you.
Bam.
Right between the blinds.
There you go.

690
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:24.490
So someday when he insects takeover this podcast as this is what's going to take

691
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:30.870
me down,
then I'll try to be like,
no,
that wasn't me.
That was somebody else.

692
00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:33.830
I sold my act and my brother just like that Guy Gallagher.

693
00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.560
I sold the podcast to him,
Bill Burr,
part two when he was doing it all,

694
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:43.550
I was fucking satisfying all.
It'll be hilarious to,

695
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:45.110
somebody actually sent me a complaint.

696
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.920
Can somebody send me an email complaining about the fact that I just murdered an

697
00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:52.940
insect mocking those fucking Peter Maniacs.

698
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.330
You know what I'm saying?
And I love animals too,
but I just hate groups.

699
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.900
I hate groups of people because in order to get noticed,

700
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.710
they just make a lot of noise and they never come up with a good chant.

701
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.570
And it's just,
I don't know,

702
00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:09.380
it's just fucking annoying to knowing and they gotta do they gotta try to be

703
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:12.470
shocking,
you know,
like,
you know,
it really sucks.

704
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.500
And there's those commercials that they make about cigarettes.

705
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.400
Have you seen that?
They always do some public demonstration.

706
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:21.500
I don't know what the fuck the name of those commercials are,

707
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.670
but they're so fucking annoying that he,
they just,
uh,

708
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.710
they make me want to smoke.

709
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.200
Just I wouldn't smoke,
but you know what I mean?
I can't even explain it.

710
00:43:33.201 --> 00:43:34.040
It's just like,
you know,

711
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.740
they make me want to do something and I don't even want to fucking do.
All right.

712
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:42.620
Whatever.
I got you guys get the point.
All right.
Whatever.
It's early.

713
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:46.490
Let me just send me a text message.
Joe.
Nick comedian out of,
uh,

714
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.640
San Francisco via fucking,
uh,
Pittsburgh said,

715
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.860
uh,
we went to the of Ucla Bruin game last night.

716
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.010
That's another reason why I didn't do the podcast cause I got off the plane,

717
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.440
I got off the plane over there mang and a Chichi,

718
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:07.100
get the yellow and I uh,
went right over to the rose bowl and I went to Ucla,

719
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:10.310
Tennessee,
Tennessee game.
Fucking unbelievable game.

720
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.760
Went into overtime and a UCLA one it,

721
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:18.570
and I think I have a team out here.
I was,
I got so fucking into that game.

722
00:44:18.571 --> 00:44:21.320
I'm tie something.
If you guys,
if you're into pro sports,

723
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.970
take a second look at college football and all everybody's psyched about the NFL

724
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:30.680
dude.
It's fucking bananas.
It's unbelievable.
Can I just say bananas?

725
00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:35.580
What Dosha?
I just really hate myself sometimes.
It's fucking bananas.
It's wacky.

726
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.820
Bananas.
You know,

727
00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:44.130
I just made myself sound like I go to games with one of those raccoon coats from

728
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:49.110
the 1920s.
Rah Rah sis boom by.
Um,
but no,
it's insane.
You know,

729
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.710
you got like the band's going crazy.
The students are going crazy.

730
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.720
They got all those chants and stuff.

731
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:58.920
It's the closest thing America has to like a,
you have a like watch those.

732
00:44:58.921 --> 00:45:02.880
Those are some of the,
the soccer or football as they call it,

733
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:07.380
over in England where people are just going bananas.
Uh,
I said bananas again.

734
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.650
Jesus is quite,
if I say it one more time,
I'm going to have to hang up on myself.

735
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.290
When the fuck did I start saying bananas?

736
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.150
You know what that's on my friends and everyone around me in my life,

737
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:20.160
but not saying,
dude,
why the fuck do you say that?

738
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:21.540
You really need to stop saying that.

739
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:27.420
It's like some of my relatives in Boston and who say Pissa.
You see that game,

740
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:28.254
dude?
Yeah,
dude,

741
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:32.880
it was Pissa like fucking in their 40 still saying that.
It's just,

742
00:45:32.881 --> 00:45:36.960
it makes me fucking skin crawl,
but then I'm saying bananas.
All right.

743
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:38.940
But anyways,
I'm into college football.
I'm actually,

744
00:45:38.941 --> 00:45:41.040
I'm doing a gig coming up in Austin,
Texas,

745
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.760
and I'm going to a Texas longhorn Missouri game.
I'm going to be there.

746
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:49.820
So if you're one of the hundred thousand fucking maniacs who were there going

747
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:53.670
nuts rather than bananas,
what's a good way to say bananas?

748
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:58.920
There's my podcast question for you.
All right.
And speaking of podcast questions,

749
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:03.780
there's a segue for you.
Um,
we're gonna get into the podcast questions,

750
00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:06.120
but first a moment from our sponsor.

751
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.880
Last week I talked about a state capitals.
Um,

752
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:12.270
did you miss that episode?
Well,

753
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:15.180
maybe she'll listen to that half hour babbling and,
uh,

754
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:19.410
I was kind of asking the question is,
why the fuck is it always the second rate?

755
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:23.040
City always seems to be the capital,
you know what I mean?

756
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:27.780
Like it's never,
uh,
you know,
New York,
it's not New York City.

757
00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:31.410
That's what you'd think it would be.
But it's Albany.
Okay.
It's,

758
00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:35.280
you go to Illinois,
it's not Chicago,
it's Springfield.
You go to Pennsylvania,

759
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:37.320
it's not Philly of Pittsburgh,
it's Harrisburg.

760
00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:40.320
It's always some like what the fuck?
You know?
And I thought it was,

761
00:46:40.321 --> 00:46:42.990
cause people initially thought that that was the town that was going to be the

762
00:46:42.991 --> 00:46:47.820
shit.
And uh,
then it stopped being the shit in another town became the shit,

763
00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.700
but they already made it be the capitol and they were too embarrassed to say

764
00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:53.100
that they made a mistake.
You know what I mean?

765
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.860
It's kind of like the people like the Jonas brothers right now,

766
00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:01.220
you know the Jonas brothers are the musical equivalent to the city of Albany.

767
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:07.350
That's what I'm trying,
that's what I'm trying to say there.
Um,

768
00:47:07.351 --> 00:47:09.060
so anyways,
this guy tries to claim,

769
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:13.020
he says on the topic of why cities like Harrisburg and almonds,
Albany,

770
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.290
our state capitols over Philly or New York City.

771
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.220
The reason is because most state capitols are located geographically in the

772
00:47:20.221 --> 00:47:23.250
center of the state.
That way local government,

773
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.510
government officials wouldn't have to travel across the whole state to get to

774
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.344
the capital.

775
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.680
There are a few exceptions like Carson city and Tallahassee,

776
00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.740
but overall that's the general reason why shit's cities are capitals.

777
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.960
Is that true?
Wait a minute.
Boston,

778
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:45.580
that's not in the middle of this state is provenance.
Provenance Kinda is.

779
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.710
I Dunno.
Is that true?
I actually got in an argument that guy the other day,

780
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:54.850
Pete Dominick comedian,
and he goes,
cite your sources.
You need three sources,

781
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:55.810
just like journalism.

782
00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:59.020
And I realized that not only do I don't not have three sources,

783
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.790
I usually don't even have one.
I just have my gut going in.

784
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.060
It sounds like fucking bullshit.

785
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:07.420
And then I just spend it so I sound like I know what I'm talking about.

786
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:10.630
So can anybody back up with that guy saying,
is that the real reason for that?

787
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.070
Huh?
Anybody?
Um,
all right,
that's it.

788
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.040
Let's get into the questions for this week.
The podcast questions.

789
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:22.850
Question number one.
Hey Bill,
I have a question for your podcast.
Um,

790
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.450
if you were locked,
and this is a great question,
by the way,

791
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.660
this is one of the greatest questions I've,
I've ever gotten.
Okay.

792
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.280
This guy is setting the fucking bar for podcast questions.

793
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.670
All right,
here is the questions.
Here's a question.
Sorry.

794
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:42.420
If you were locked in a gymnasium full of hundreds of unarmed six-year-olds of

795
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.670
various weight,
height races and temperaments,

796
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.940
and all you had were the clothes on your back,

797
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:56.890
how many of them do you think you could kill before they overpowered you?

798
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.640
What a fucking great question.
All right,

799
00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:04.570
so obviously I'm setting all morals aside here.

800
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.800
If you set aside all morals and all feelings of guilt and a,

801
00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:15.340
or maybe I just felt like I was right,
like these were evil kids.

802
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.780
I'm trying to think of a reason why a gymnasium full of six year olds of various

803
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:21.880
weights,
heights and races and temperaments,

804
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:27.890
how many do I think I could fucking kill before they overpowered me?
Uh,

805
00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.510
let's see here.
The average is six year old has got to be about,

806
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.430
are they four feet minute,
four feet tall?

807
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.990
Like fucking Tim Duncan was probably four feet tall when he was six.

808
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.660
And there any future NBA players in this,
if they're not,

809
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:43.480
if they're just going to be like accountants and fucking,
you know,

810
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:46.210
occasional wife beater,
that'd be the tough one.
I think,

811
00:49:46.211 --> 00:49:49.330
you know what I'd have to do,
do they know I'm going to overpower me?

812
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.830
I'm just going to have to assume like if they know that I'm coming in there as

813
00:49:53.831 --> 00:49:58.690
the killer of six year olds.
So they all banded together to try to slay me.

814
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:04.450
I mean,
I think the first thing I'd have to do,
not just not to hack off of,
uh,

815
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.600
ESPN analysts here and use one of their expressions,

816
00:50:07.601 --> 00:50:08.650
but I'm going to have to here.

817
00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.210
I think the first thing I'd have to do is I'd have to set the tone and by

818
00:50:13.211 --> 00:50:14.080
setting the tone,

819
00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:19.081
I mean I just have to do something so fucked up to the first wave of Braveheart,

820
00:50:19.421 --> 00:50:24.240
six year olds coming at me that I would have that give those steps.
Second wave,

821
00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.220
that split second of thinking about what the fuck they were doing.
Right.

822
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.600
And uh,
I'm talking about leg sweeps,

823
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.830
the kind that would,
that would blow out and adult ACL.
Okay.

824
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.570
Which would I'm talking,
yeah,

825
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.410
I'm wearing timberlands and I'm going to fucking,

826
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.860
I get one of them with one of those,
you know,
you remember that move.

827
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:46.850
What's his face used to do?

828
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:50.120
Andre the giant when they throw a dude off the ropes and he just stick his foot

829
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:50.954
up.

830
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.800
I don't know man.
I don't know.
Fuck,
I don't know how many I could get,

831
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:58.940
how many I could kill.

832
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.680
I'd have to fuck them up first and leave them days and then I'd have to go back

833
00:51:03.681 --> 00:51:07.780
to finishing them off.
But,
uh,
if I just had to use my fist man,
I mean,
you know,

834
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.930
even though the six year old that's still a skull,
it's going to hurt.
Wow.

835
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.700
I'm getting really creepy with this on.
Okay.

836
00:51:13.701 --> 00:51:16.100
I would say I could probably fuck up.

837
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.550
I could kill about 11
I could kill 11 but you know,
I,
you know what,

838
00:51:22.551 --> 00:51:26.580
you know,
I think that I could go kill a number that low is because number one,

839
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:30.050
someone to discovery channel,
I saw this wasp entered this,

840
00:51:30.051 --> 00:51:35.051
this beehive of these honeybees and like the wasps in or whatever the fuck it

841
00:51:35.841 --> 00:51:38.450
was can destroy the honeybees.
They can kill like a hundred to one.

842
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:42.440
They can destroy these fuckers.
So what happened was he went in there,

843
00:51:42.441 --> 00:51:46.460
he was doing surveillance for his,
his wasp or his horn at nest.

844
00:51:46.461 --> 00:51:49.190
And then now he's going to go back and get his boys and they were all going to

845
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:51.890
come back.
Are you sending out a signal for them to come?

846
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.910
So what he didn't realize was the honeybee som and they started like wiggling

847
00:51:55.911 --> 00:52:00.830
their acids as a signal.
And what happened was,
is that the exact fucking moment,

848
00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:05.390
all the honeybees jumped on the fucking wasp of the horn at the same time.

849
00:52:05.391 --> 00:52:08.570
And they want top of them.
And they started like basically dry humping him.

850
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.120
But what they really were doing,
and they will vibrating.

851
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:17.050
And I guess a Hornet can only survive in temperatures up to 116 degrees,

852
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:23.720
where a honeybee can go up to 118 degrees.
So these mother fuckers,

853
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:29.030
they vibrated to the point where the temperature was 118 degrees,

854
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:33.350
one degree fucking more away,
117 degrees,

855
00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:37.040
one degree more than the Horner could,
could fucking survive.

856
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:40.730
And one degree less than what would fucking kill them.
It was,

857
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.560
it was one of the greatest attacks,
the mercy Malaya.

858
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:45.110
And they basically cook the fucker.
And that was the end him.

859
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:50.111
So get those six year olds knew I was coming and they all jumped on me and

860
00:52:50.631 --> 00:52:54.920
started fucking vibrating being a redhead.
I mean,
once they got over 80 degrees,

861
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:58.550
I would be fucked.
I'd be passed out and that would be the end of it.

862
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:02.750
All they'd have to do is drag my unconscious carcass out into the sun and then

863
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:07.130
that would be it.
That would be a deaths by third degrees.
Sunburns.

864
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.030
All right,
Jesus.
I'm like,
God bless from answering that one.
Okay,

865
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.810
now we're getting onto overrated,
underrated.
Then I got to get on with my,
uh,

866
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:17.420
with my day here as to you.
Who's kidding?
Who,

867
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.360
why am I acting like I'm the only busy one?
All right.

868
00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:22.670
For those of you new to my podcast,
last couple of weeks,

869
00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:25.010
people have been sending me in,
uh,

870
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.670
their list of stuff that they think is overrated and underrated.

871
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.380
I'll say as a new Ucla Bruin fan,
you know,
when I find fucking overrated,

872
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.650
the fucking Tennessee volunteers.
What do you think about that?

873
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.520
Ranked 18th against Ucla where they ranked 44th,

874
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.810
the third string quarterback when a Jekyll and Hyde gain the guy too for

875
00:53:45.811 --> 00:53:47.880
pickoffs.
One for a touchdown the first half.

876
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.070
And then he came out in the second half.
Like fucking Joe Montana,
Kurt Warner,

877
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.970
and maybe even Fran Tarkington.
Um,
all right.

878
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:02.070
You don't actually is overrated is underrated,
is a man's ability to shower,

879
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:05.520
shave,
and be ready and in the fucking car within 15 minutes.

880
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.000
I experienced that this weekend when Finney brand,

881
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.450
the beloved owner of the Stress Factory in New Jersey took me out on his boat.

882
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.970
Okay.
And we came back,

883
00:54:14.971 --> 00:54:17.790
the show was in an hour and there was some sort of boat house and he's like,

884
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:21.960
he talks like fucking,
you know,
a muppet.
He's like,
oh,
I got it on there.
I got,

885
00:54:21.961 --> 00:54:24.860
oh I got to take a shower.
Just hang on a second.

886
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:28.770
He leaves me in the car with his awful fucking Bruce Springsteen CD cause

887
00:54:28.771 --> 00:54:33.420
everybody in New Jersey loves Bruce Springsteen.
So,
uh,

888
00:54:33.421 --> 00:54:35.340
he goes in and I'm thinking,
it's going to be a fuck.

889
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:38.970
He's going to be in for 25 fucking minutes.
Let's do it in and out came out,

890
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.380
you know,
he looked great,
smelled of man soap and he was fucking ready to go.

891
00:54:43.381 --> 00:54:46.350
He actually make,
made me feel unclean within 10 minutes.

892
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:51.510
It's an incredible thing.
So that's my overrated,
underrated for the week.
Okay,

893
00:54:51.511 --> 00:54:55.290
here's everybody else's.
Alright.
Overrated Stella bear.

894
00:54:55.650 --> 00:55:00.390
It tastes just like Budweiser and every non tasting having schlepped insist it's

895
00:55:00.391 --> 00:55:03.990
a quality beer.
I guess nobody's heard of Lam.

896
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:08.520
Lango needas or dog fish head.
You know what?

897
00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:13.080
I've never heard of those either and I can't,
I can't pass judgment on those.

898
00:55:13.081 --> 00:55:17.070
But those sounds like those kinds of beers that I see when I go to Colorado and

899
00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:21.630
there's those,
those rafting hippie,
I'm into Dave Matthews,

900
00:55:21.631 --> 00:55:24.750
Bergen stock,
hackey sack fuckers drinking,
that kind of shit.

901
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.200
You know when you go down there and they have those,
those fucking micro brews.

902
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:32.370
I think microbrews overrated.
But the best one I did,

903
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.240
I went to was the one I told you Dan on Nantucket.
Cisco Breweries.
Man,
God damn.

904
00:55:36.241 --> 00:55:39.720
And I'm still waiting for my vodka by the way.
You sons of bitches.

905
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.330
I understand your mom and pop.
What the fuck?

906
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.560
I got three bottles at AAA coming my way and I have since quit drinking.

907
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.820
Maybe they listened to the podcast.
All right.

908
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:53.640
Overrated hyped up bachelor parties.
Oh,
isn't that the truth?

909
00:55:53.641 --> 00:55:55.350
You always think it's going to be like a fucking movie.

910
00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:59.220
This guy says if you have to wear a tee shirt that says something like stick a

911
00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:03.390
fork in them,
it's almost guaranteed that it's going to be a queer fest

912
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.240
especially.
There's definitely going to be at least one dip.
Shit.

913
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.730
That is way too into taking pictures.

914
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.580
I know how gay is that guys can't take pictures.

915
00:56:14.581 --> 00:56:16.470
That's fucking gay wanting something gay about me.

916
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:20.520
I'm actually in the flowers to a like it's so gay.

917
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:25.730
It goes beyond gay and comes back a heterosexual I think.

918
00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:31.660
No it doesn't.
Maybe it comes to a sort of gay,
heterosexual,

919
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:34.120
I dunno.
I like flowers.
I realized that about myself.

920
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:38.230
I bought a couple of bases and every week I come off the road I was actually

921
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:42.750
arranging them today like measuring the stems and looking at the colors to try

922
00:56:42.751 --> 00:56:45.130
to set them up.
I've got like these daisies,
right?

923
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.760
I got one is yellow ones like this sort of like a,

924
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:51.820
you have a sea of fender strat.
When they got that sunburst finish,

925
00:56:51.821 --> 00:56:54.730
that's what it looks like.
Then I got like these three lavender one.

926
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:57.520
So put the lavender ones in the back.
They'd like the backup singers.

927
00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:58.720
You know what I mean?
You know like those,

928
00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:01.700
those big black chicks they always have behind the skinny white girl.

929
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.460
Can't fucking sing.
You know
that's how I arrange them.

930
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.910
I put the Pale ones out front.
That's like Paul Simon.
That's what it is.

931
00:57:09.911 --> 00:57:12.100
It's like Paul Simon on the rhythm of the saints tour.

932
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:16.060
That's how I arrange them and I don't know,
I look at them,
they make me feel good

933
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.610
and you know,
I'm comfortable enough with myself to be able to admit that.

934
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.910
All right,
another overrated thing.

935
00:57:23.911 --> 00:57:28.911
Somebody said Notre Dame and he said I can go on forever forever about this one.

936
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:34.530
But the amount of assets that a blue chipper gives up not playing in places like

937
00:57:34.931 --> 00:57:37.930
South Beach,
Miami or southern California.

938
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:42.580
Cause he just had to wait cause he just had to wear the gold helmet sickens me.

939
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.370
Oh isn't that truth?
That's the truth.
Yeah.

940
00:57:45.371 --> 00:57:48.640
But he played for the University of Miami.
Man,
that's a fucking dangerous place.

941
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:52.630
That's a Goddamn dangerous placement.
You guys have fatalities on the regular,

942
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.970
on your teeth?
And I just say on the regular,

943
00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.890
whether they rent fucking Friday last night,

944
00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:02.320
how do I start off saying bananas and then I go with only on the regular,
um,

945
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.050
you know,
something,
I always wanted to go to university of Miami game,

946
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:06.970
but I wanted to go when they played in the orange bowl.

947
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.410
Now they play in the Joe Robbie.
It just doesn't seem right.
You know what I mean?

948
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:16.840
Um,
okay.
Another thing,
overrated Asian Pussy.

949
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:23.130
I'm not sure what I was expecting,
but I'll be honest.
I was expecting more.
Uh,

950
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.620
well did you ever think that maybe the Asian you hooked up with wasn't good in

951
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:29.980
bed?
I mean,
you're going to judge an entire continent.

952
00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:34.570
You know what's funny is when people say Asian immediately,

953
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:38.350
myself included as an,
everybody thinks,
you know,
Chinese,
Japanese,
Korean,

954
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.450
Vietnamese,
anybody,
you know,
with the,
uh,
quote unquote,
uh,
Asian eyes,

955
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:45.400
one of the politically correct way of,

956
00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:49.990
of saying what the fucking Spanish basketball team was trying to do.

957
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.210
But that also could be mean.

958
00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:56.350
You hooked up from somebody from India and they stuck in bed.

959
00:58:56.410 --> 00:59:00.460
You know what I mean?
I think you should.
Uh,
listen,
there's fucking hotties.

960
00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:04.600
Well,
you know what,
this,
this deserves a followup question.

961
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.010
How many Asians did you hook up with before you decided to do an entire

962
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:11.620
continent of pussy?
I mean,
that,

963
00:59:11.621 --> 00:59:14.560
that's pretty amazing when it's one of the biggest continence out there.

964
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:18.490
If not the biggest is it?
I have no fucking,
it was Africa.
Bigger Africa's bigger,

965
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.130
but I got to tell you something.
Asia is on the rise too.
So,
you know,

966
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.970
be watch what you say.
Okay?
You saw what China did in the Olympics.

967
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:30.170
They can do that on the rings.
Just think what they can do when the fucking,

968
00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:34.970
I dunno.
Computer industry.
All right,
let's get to a,
let's get the underrated,

969
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.380
underrated.
This guy says,
our early ninety's gangster rap videos,

970
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:42.260
hands down the greatest videos ever made.

971
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:46.400
Just a bunch of black dudes hanging out in Compton with their baseball caps

972
00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:50.120
blurred out.
I miss those days.
Uh,
I gotta agree with you,
man.

973
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.770
Those were fucking great days from that time.

974
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:54.650
They was that really pretty girl at the party and they all shake up their

975
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.950
forties and they dump it on her head because she,
you know,

976
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.520
she thought she was the shit.
You know what the reality is,

977
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:06.790
is they were looking at her thinking that she thought that she was the shit for

978
01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:10.250
all you know,
she was fucking,
she was probably insecure,

979
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:13.490
like a lot of beautiful women are.
He always got some sort of hangup.
Oh my God,

980
01:00:13.491 --> 01:00:15.350
I hate my ankle.
You know,
some,

981
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:17.930
she was probably thinking that because she wasn't wearing jeans.

982
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:20.930
She's wearing that little hoary outfit.
So she's actually in our head,

983
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.360
which caused her to have a shutdown look on her face.

984
01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:24.770
So then snoop it or whoever,

985
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.850
Dre or Warren g will ever the fuck it was out there in Cali.

986
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:32.030
They all sell it goes bitch.
She,
she's all fucking stuck up.

987
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:36.020
And then they shook up their forties and they dumped it over a fucking head and

988
01:00:36.021 --> 01:00:40.490
she probably ran home crying thinking that they did it because they didn't like

989
01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:44.000
our ankles.
And you know what?
That probably led to her being a stripper.

990
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.130
That's how it happens.
All right?
Uh,
underrated.
Ricky Gervais'.

991
01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.360
This made two great TV shows and less than five years,

992
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.670
less than five years of each other.

993
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:57.800
And he still doesn't get the Kudos he deserves.

994
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:01.070
Maybe it's because there's no laugh track.
Who knows?
I gotta say something.

995
01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:02.660
Ricky Gervais' is a fucking genius.

996
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:05.840
And if you never saw the original version of the office,

997
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.220
no offense to the American version,
it's unbelievable.
You,
that guy,

998
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:14.090
that guy is a genius.
That one,
I can't remember the,
what the episode was about,

999
01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:19.091
but that one where he plays the guitar in the middle of the meeting is the most

1000
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.660
uncomfortable,
hilarious fucking thing I've ever seen.
And that guy,

1001
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:28.870
I liked how he has a drinking problem and how being an alcoholic is still funny

1002
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.170
in England.
You can make fun of people having drinking problems over here.

1003
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.030
It's early.
We got to have an intervention.
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1004
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:43.280
Um,
all right,
we're winding down here.
Uh,
the movie basketball,

1005
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:48.920
David Zucker and the south park guys together,
a very underappreciated movie.

1006
01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:51.740
You know what?
I got to rent that because when I looked at the trailer,
I'm like,

1007
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:52.970
that looks fucking stupid.

1008
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:57.320
And then a comedian that I respected sought and told me it was hilarious and it

1009
01:01:57.321 --> 01:02:02.210
was a good movie.
And,
uh,
I'm going to rent that,
I'm going to rent that fucker.
Uh,

1010
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:06.470
speaking of which,
I finally saw Miller's crossing and,
and,

1011
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:11.030
and I got to admit,
uh,
John Turturro is fucking unreal.

1012
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:15.500
And that movie got,
damn it.
That was a good fucking movie.
Um,
all right,

1013
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:20.100
last thing.
Last thing for this week's underrated list is rage.
The machine.

1014
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:25.320
This guy says,
in my opinion,
the best band in the past 20 years.
Wow.

1015
01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.110
And for all the shit that's going on in the world now,

1016
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.180
their music was way before its time.

1017
01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.880
That original album is genius from start to finish.

1018
01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:36.930
My only complaint was when I saw them at Randall's island last year.

1019
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:42.470
It was rage against the machine brought to you by rockstar energy drink.

1020
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.010
That upset me as well.
It should as well it should.
But you know something.

1021
01:02:47.011 --> 01:02:48.390
That's what happens after awhile.

1022
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.780
After awhile you get into middle age and you're like,
you know what?

1023
01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:55.890
At some point I'd like to sleep on a bed.
I'd like to have a fucking couch.

1024
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.520
And you know what,
I drink rockstar energy drink.
It tastes good to me.

1025
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:04.650
So if they want to fucking finance the God damn for what?
Do I care?
I mean,

1026
01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:09.600
do they have eight year olds putting rock star drink into fucking coke cans over

1027
01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:13.470
in Thailand?
Because if that's the case,
I won't support it.
Okay.

1028
01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.510
But if it's somebody used to build fucking,

1029
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:18.330
I don't know where the fuck I'm going with this.
Anyways,

1030
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:22.200
I want to thank everybody for listening to my podcast and like I said,

1031
01:03:22.201 --> 01:03:24.460
if you do it on my page,
which I keep saying because I,
well,

1032
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.080
I'm hoping I have some new people with the new special out.
Um,

1033
01:03:28.081 --> 01:03:30.630
I do one of these every week to give you a laugh.
At the beginning of the week,

1034
01:03:30.631 --> 01:03:34.770
I answer questions people send in their underrated overrated,
uh,

1035
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.760
lifts.
I'm trying to get an a,
a new,
uh,

1036
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.970
lists going because I'm starting to think that that one is,
uh,
I think we've,

1037
01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.960
I think we've pretty much handled it at this point.
Um,
keeps sending those in.

1038
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:50.070
But if anybody wants to start a new list,
please by all means,
because,
uh,

1039
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.160
I do not have creative control of the podcast.

1040
01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:54.720
If you want to switch the direction of it,

1041
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:57.180
just send me a funny fucking email that spins the off.

1042
01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.100
I'll babble about something else.

1043
01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:02.400
Maybe somebody else will add to it and that's how it happens.
Huh?

1044
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.320
Isn't that interesting?
All right,
so this week coming up,
I'm going to be a,

1045
01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:11.190
I'm actually doing a college gig at a with Charlie Murphy and uh,

1046
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:14.790
Umass Amhurst in Boston.
Now it's a private show.

1047
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:19.230
So that's only for students unless you somehow wink,
wink,

1048
01:04:19.231 --> 01:04:21.960
figure out a way to sneak in,
which you didn't hear here,

1049
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:23.910
which of course you did because now it's the podcast.

1050
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:25.320
I don't advocate doing that.

1051
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:29.430
I don't advocate putting on a baseball hat and looking like you are of college

1052
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:33.150
age and trying to just sort of walk a walk in with the rest of the students.

1053
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:37.950
I do not advocate doing that.
Okay.
Don't do that.

1054
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:42.780
That would really make me upset.
All right there.
I'm in the clear now.
Um,

1055
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:48.450
and the following week,
September 11th through the 11,
20 and 30,
I think the 13th,

1056
01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:52.590
I'm going to be at the punchline in San Francisco and the weekend after that,

1057
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.230
uh,
what's 11 and seven 11 and 17,

1058
01:04:55.231 --> 01:05:00.231
18 1920 and 21 I will be at the funny bone in uh,

1059
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.650
Richmond,
Virginia.
Oh,

1060
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:08.630
be vigilant visiting my buddy sludge out there on the radio and uh,

1061
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.410
I'll be performing right down there at the mall,

1062
01:05:10.411 --> 01:05:13.670
right across some Dick's sporting goods.
How you liked that,

1063
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:18.360
right back down to earth.
One hour special.
I'm on top of the world.

1064
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:22.890
Two weeks later I'm performing across some addicts and Richmond,

1065
01:05:22.891 --> 01:05:27.520
Virginia is a fucking reality slap for you.
Um,
and that is it.

1066
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:31.020
And the new DVD,
we'll be out of the special on September 16th.

1067
01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.090
And I will be selling that fucker.
Right.

1068
01:05:33.091 --> 01:05:36.210
All my shows and I'll be autographing autographing it.

1069
01:05:36.211 --> 01:05:39.810
And if you buy it and he just want to come to one of my shows and bring it up to

1070
01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.780
me and you want me to sign it,
I'll sign the fucker.
Cause uh,

1071
01:05:42.781 --> 01:05:44.880
I appreciate you buying them.
And that is it.

1072
01:05:44.881 --> 01:05:48.850
And for those of you who want to know what the extras are on it really quick,
uh,

1073
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:51.780
I have the Philadelphia rant is one of the extras,

1074
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.370
the classic cell phone footage from the show in Camden,

1075
01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.760
New Jersey where I got booed in front of all those people.
He,

1076
01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:03.000
everybody knows what it is.
So that I got that on there.

1077
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:07.800
I got the uninformed one where I had my radio show where me and Joe got an a

1078
01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:12.390
huge argument and then we ended up,
we tried to settle it with a drum battle.
And,

1079
01:06:12.391 --> 01:06:15.630
uh,
then I got some other footage of me just going around to the New York clubs,

1080
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:18.920
talking about different horrific sets that I've had over the years,

1081
01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:22.620
just telling the story.
So ton of extras and all that bullshit.

1082
01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:25.140
And now I'm done babbling.
Thank you so much for listening.

1083
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.720
You guys all have a good weekend next week.

1084
01:06:27.721 --> 01:06:31.560
I actually will do it on Monday on the Monday morning podcast.
There you go,

1085
01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:32.460
everybody have a good week.

1086
01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:32.820
<v 5>All right.</v>

1087
01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:37.820
Bye.

1088
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.460
Yeah.
