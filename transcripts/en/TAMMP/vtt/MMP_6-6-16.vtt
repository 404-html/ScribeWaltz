1
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.350
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.351 --> 00:00:05.110
It's Bill Byrd is time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:07.660
June 6th,
2016.

4
00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:11.290
This is like the fifth fucking time I've tried to start this thing because,
uh,

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.250
I dunno,
I just had an aborted landing.
Well,
I didn't have one.

6
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:18.290
The pilot had one and uh,
I was riding in the back in the end.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.220
What are you going to do?
What we landed safely,
you know,

8
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.300
some airplane didn't clear the runway.
That was my fifth one that I've had.

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.940
I've had five of boarded landings and that was my second one at lax.
Um,

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.620
first one was vehicle on a runway and this next one,

11
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:37.030
a guy didn't plane was still on the runway,
didn't clear it or whatever,
but uh,

12
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.530
it was a little less scary.
Now that I've flown a little bit,

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.050
you know,
not a lot but a little bit,
but uh,

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.810
you still in the back and you can't see what's going on.
So that's,

15
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.830
that's always nice.
Um,
all right.

16
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:54.040
So people have been asking me,
they've been emailing me,

17
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.650
they'd been twittering me,
they'd been Facebooking me,
um,

18
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.140
about what's going on with these Irish dates.

All right.

21
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.260
I have the presale information,

22
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.590
but for whatever reason I'm not allowed to announce it,

Just this is why I had to rerecord it.

31
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.900

Um,

48
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.640
and with that,
let's get into the podcast.
Ah,

49
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.850
I around [inaudible] it's still acting up.

50
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.270
I'm going to every fucking witch doctor out here at this point.

51
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:08.980
I don't give a shit.
You know,

52
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.460
some woman was talking to me was saying how she got Sciatica when she was

53
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.750
pregnant and I was just like,
he called me fat and she,
she laughed.
She's like,
no,

54
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:21.520
she goes,
I just,
I just got it.
And uh,
she went someplace and she goes,

55
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:25.540
they just kind of lightly just with on my backside.

56
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.350
I thought they were really going to need in there and they just kind of lightly.

57
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:31.990
You want to like what the,
nobody's fucking putting leaves on my butt cheeks.

58
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.720
I'm getting what everybody else first before that.
Um,
but I got to tell you,

59
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.110
like something happens with the air pressure when I'm on a plane,

60
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:44.950
the back of my leg,
it feels like my hamstrings gonna snap a.

61
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.450
So I've got to keep standing up doing my Vietnamese gambler fucking squat and

62
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:53.710
um,
I dunno,
trying to stretch out the PSOAS muscle.

63
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.220
I'm doing everything I can to try to keep this thing at bay because I don't

64
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:01.030
fucking have the time to take care of it.
I just don't,

65
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:05.140
I'm too fucking busy here with a writing this filthy wonderful cartoon,

66
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:08.080
which I'm having a great time doing at bopped episode six this week.

67
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:13.081
People up to episode six writing as far as far as that aspect of it.

68
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.730
I literally signed the fucking rain man.
All right,

69
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:20.410
let me take it through my trip here.
All right.
I had some fucking guy,

70
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.630
he was like in his early sixties gift me this fucking look like he was gonna

71
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.930
Punch me in the face to the point I had to say something to them and I know you

72
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:29.860
guys are thinking like,
Bill,

73
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:34.180
what the fuck you talking shit to a guy 63 well I'm going to be 48 this week.

74
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:38.350
So you know when I was 15 he was 30 so it's not that bad.
We're,

75
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.850
we're pretty close.
Right.
When I was 10 he was 25 right.

76
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.300
You know,
you think he wouldn't have picked on me back then is what happened.

77
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:51.040
Right.
So I went down,
go around the airport,

78
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.470
right.
I got bumped up the business.
So I get to go first.

79
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.240
I get to go into the lounge,
right.

80
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.090
They get to go in and fucking pour myself some corn flakes or whatever.

81
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:05.710
So I go into the lounge and there's this fucking guy,
right.
He just,
I dunno,

82
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.430
I just,
I got on the elevator and he was there and he was kind of in my space,

83
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.400
but he was a little oblivious or whatever.
Right.

84
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.240
Fucking horseshoe level bald and he dies the sides,

85
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:18.460
which is always hysterical to me.
Like,
dude,
what the,

86
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:23.440
why you still dying that you think that makes you look younger?
Um,
so anyways,

87
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.910
it's like five in the fucking,

88
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.280
it's before five in the morning because that's what time my flight is.

89
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.030
And you know,
I go up to the lounge and I sat my shit down.
He goes as other way.

90
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.440
I'm not even thinking about this guy.

91
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.470
And then I'm walking over to where the cereal is and so is he all right?

92
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.490
Like two planes about to land,
you know,
on the same runway.
I'm in front of them,

93
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.180
I have priority.
So I walk over there and then he,

94
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.180
I feel him standing way close to close to me.

95
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.790
And when I finished,
you know,
I just did a couple of turns,
you know,

96
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.020
the fucking Syrah thing,

97
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:00.110
couple turns of the KNOB and it goes into the ball and then I pour some milk in

98
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.320
it.
It probably took me less than 15 seconds to do that.

99
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.380
And when I turned around because I just felt them,
I want to turn the other way,

100
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:10.250
but I felt him on my left shoulder turn and looked at him and he was glaring at

101
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.860
me showing me all of his bottom teeth,
you know,
was like,

102
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.580
except he wasn't making that noise.
But you know the face you make when you,
eh,

103
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.780
that's what,
when he was looking at me,
just glaring at me.

104
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.650
<v 2>Okay,</v>

105
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.300
<v 1>so what the fuck did I say to him?
I just looked down,
I was like,</v>

106
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.500
I remember I said,
are you,
I got you are,
you are right.
That's what I said.

107
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.640
Are you all right?
And then he didn't say anything.

108
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.430
And then I felt bad like,
oh man,
was,
was he like one of those old guys?

109
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:45.950
Remember I did that bit.
The old man face was that,

110
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.690
is that the beginning of the old man face?

111
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:51.680
You start glaring at first and then you gradually get more scared?

112
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.890
I have no idea.
Right.
Um,

113
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.650
<v 2>okay.</v>

114
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.040
<v 1>It's like those old people know they're going to hell but think it back on their</v>

115
00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:01.560
life and they're trying to think they have enough time to say enough hair,

116
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.570
hail Mary's.
And they just realize they can do,

117
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.700
they probably saw ghosts and saw those creepy things coming up from hell.

118
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.590
So anyways,
he didn't say anything.

119
00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:14.910
So I walk away and I'm thinking that feeling bad.
Like,
Oh man,
I,
I,

120
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.990
I,
uh,
you know,
I just fucking yelled at that old,
I didn't yell at the old guy,

121
00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:21.810
but I kind of keep them shit,
you know,

122
00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:26.670
so I felt bad then went over to sit down and then he gets his fucking cereal and

123
00:07:26.671 --> 00:07:29.910
at this point,
you know,
I'm like,
I'm like fucking 20 yards away from this guy,

124
00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:33.480
sit down.
And He fucking turns around.
And as he,
he's walking over to his wife,

125
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.280
he looks at me and shakes his fucking head up.
So he was glaring at me.

126
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.733
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.130
<v 1>So later I go to get up to get a fucking apple and I knew we was going to be</v>

128
00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.860
looking at and I looked right over at him and I,

129
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:50.050
I can't remember what the fuck I did.
And then I was like,
really built,

130
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.960
are you really doing this?
Neither one of these is going to fight.

131
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:57.580
You're both too fucking old to fight.
And uh,
that's how my trip started.

132
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.840
So I should've known that it was going to be a weird travel experience.

133
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.280
Um,
ended up getting into a Syracuse.
That's what I was going the first night.

134
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.020
And we played this minor league hockey arena and a,

135
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:18.040
I didn't know at the time until I got there.
They actually,
uh,
filmed,

136
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.030
um,
that's where they filmed slap shot a lot of it when they did all this stuff,

137
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:24.570
you know,
I'm listening to the fucking song when they were on the key,
uh,

138
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.970
the ice and everything,
so that was cool as shit.
Um,

139
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.820
the next night we did another one of those small hockey arenas and they,

140
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.950
that one they told me that was the place Elvis was supposed to perform at.

141
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.780
Um,
but he died the day before.
That was his next concert.

142
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.470
And so they still have all these Elvis tickets and they actually gave me this

143
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:49.000
little frame thing of a couple of Elvis tickets.

144
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:53.290
And then the date that I played there was really fucking cool.
Um,

145
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.100
what the fuck did I go

146
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.770
<v 3>after that?
Oh,
then I went down to ball.</v>

147
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.310
I was driving from Portland back to fucking Albany.
Who's kidding?
Who?

148
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.980
I wasn't fucking far as he was riding.

149
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:08.850
We were in this SUV and I was laying down in the back seat because my fucking

150
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:13.740
leg was killing me.
Um,
it shits really starting to scare me,
man.

151
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.420
Like how fucking long is this going to take?

152
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.490
I've been dealing with this shit since February.

153
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.750
Every time I start to turn the corner,
I got to get on a plane again.
So

154
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.360
people who stare at me too,
when I stand up on the plane,
I squat down.

155
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:29.370
I don't even give a fuck.
And they're just looking at me.

156
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.830
I told you the last time this guy asked me if I was praying.

157
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.270
So,
um,
anyways,

158
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:42.390
then the final show last night was in Albany,
but I actually,

159
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:46.320
when we drove from Portland,
which so many memories came back,

160
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.740
we went over that bridge when we went over this bridge in a,

161
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.470
where you go from New Hampshire to Maine.
And I remember I used to fucking,

162
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.620
one of my first girlfriends used to live over there,
Brandon,

163
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:00.060
the other side of that.
What?
She didn't live there,

164
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.220
she lived down in the Boston area,
but she had like family up there.

165
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:04.890
I remember going up on over that bridge.
I always think of that shit.

166
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.550
I always think about the ticket that I got on the fucking turnpike up there,

167
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.350
driving my piece of shit truck back.
Um,
the comedy connection up there,

168
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:17.160
all of that shit.
And,
um,
I gotta tell you man,

169
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.380
just living out here in la,

170
00:10:18.381 --> 00:10:22.860
like all people in New York for Mont New Hampshire in Western mass in Maine,

171
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:27.861
I hope they realize how fucking lucky they are to live where it rains and

172
00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:31.890
there's all that lush land.
I'm so fucking jealous of that shit.

173
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.710
Like when I came back,
um,
we,

174
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.270
when we were driving from Portland to,
uh,
Albany,

175
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:42.480
I actually went down to the Boston area to visit some family and friends and

176
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:46.140
stop off and one of my favorite pizza places and uh,

177
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.320
we can't ended up coming down route one and the fucking memories that were

178
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:56.010
coming back,
it was a strip club up there.

179
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.940
There was the hilltop steakhouse would say now completely knocked down.

180
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.140
I hope that sign,
cause it's still up that giant fucking cactus.

181
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.610
I hope somehow like that thing is protected.

182
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.810
You know what I mean?
You know,
it's funny.
That's like one of those dumb things.

183
00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:16.470
They'll sell on fucking Ebay for like 1 million bucks and it'll say like 15

184
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:19.260
people are watching this,
you know,
do you know,
like,

185
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.590
like back in the day how they used to,
they used to catch people with warrants.

186
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.330
They would just have a,
like during like a fight or something,

187
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.070
they would just advertise,
hey,
you're the,
you're the 20th person to order this.

188
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.440
Come down here and claim your free gift.

189
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.770
And they'd call these people up and they would all got out and claimed the gifts

190
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:40.530
and then I'll be all these people standing around down there and then the cops

191
00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:43.620
would just walk in and they'd fucking arrest everybody.
Um,

192
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.520
they should fucking do that with,
with dumb shit like that on Ebay.

193
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:50.580
Like the giant,
the hilltop steakhouse,
right?

194
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.300
There's 15 people watching it.
Those 15 should immediately be audited.

195
00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.960
Who would have,
who the fuck's got 1 million bucks to blow on a giant lit up cat?

196
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.500
I mean,
everybody wants it.
Well,
not everybody.

197
00:12:04.501 --> 00:12:06.960
I'd love to have that fucking thing,
you know,

198
00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:09.510
get yourself a spread out in the middle of nowhere.

199
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:13.350
You have a giant lit up cactus,
your friends come over,
right.

200
00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:16.740
Just don't make a right at the giant cactus.
You know,

201
00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:21.630
you get a nickname out of it all.
Cactus Chris,
he's fucking crazy.
Um,

202
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.690
but nobody has the money to do that shit.

203
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.530
<v 1>Right?
Like I went on Ebay,
right.
And I was uh,</v>

204
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.470
I don't the fuck I was looking,
I was trying to,
you know,
kill the flight now.

205
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:37.100
Now you can,
you know,
go online.
So I was just looking up random shit like,
uh,

206
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.390
humidors even though I've gotten cigars mostly out of my life,

207
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:42.640
I was just looking him up cause I think they're fucking cool.
Right.

208
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.411
Well I know when I was doing,

209
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:47.840
I was looking at cigar affection auto and they had all these,
you know,

210
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.380
cool places where you can smoke a cigar.

211
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:53.320
They let you know in different cities like places to smoke and shit.
Right?

212
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.660
Like I already find a cool place in London.
Um,
possibly just smoke.
We'll see.

213
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.700
And uh,
that is,
if I smoked it,
I don't know.
We'll figure it out anyways.
Uh,

214
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.360
and that just got me thinking about cigar smoking and all that type of shit.

215
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.000
So I went on Ebay and a lot of the shit that comes along with cigar smoke and

216
00:13:11.001 --> 00:13:12.790
it's pretty fucking cool.
A lot of the lighters,

217
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.150
a lot of the ash trays and the humor doors.
And I like looking at that stuff,

218
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.480
especially if they're vintage or old.
So I look up vintage humor door.

219
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.440
I'm sure it's still there.
And this,
this,
this is fucking,

220
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.970
I think it's sitting bull.
It's this bust of sitting bull.

221
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.923
All right.

222
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.600
That's what the fuck and humidors it's a bust of sitting bull and what's really

223
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:38.800
fucking,
you know,
weird is to to,
you know,

224
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.100
put your cigars in it.
You basically take off the scalp,

225
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.680
which I thought was a little fucking tacky,
but granted it's old.

226
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.870
That was considered a Mike.
Totally fine back in the day.
Right?

227
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.970
Um,
so anyways,
this fucking thing is going for a million and a half dollars

228
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.140
and it has in it,
it says like,
there's like 20 people watching.

229
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:03.630
I'm looking it up right now.
ebay.com.
All right.

230
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.540
Okay.
Vintage humidor.

231
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.440
All right.

Indian statue,</v>

234
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.630
Antique American folk art,
vintage tobacco.
You know,

235
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:26.200
it's funny from the side it actually looks cool from straight on.

236
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:30.540
It just looks like,
I dunno,
it's kind of looking off big.

237
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.560
He kind of look sad and then they,
I don't understand why.

238
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:35.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.940
<v 3>Sing is a million and a half bucks to 61 people watching this 61 people have a</v>

240
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.870
million and a half dollars to spend on a fucking humidor.

241
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.340
I Dunno.
Like that's the type of shit right there.

242
00:14:50.341 --> 00:14:54.060
Like if I was dodging taxes and all that type of shit,
you know,

243
00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:57.680
go out and do this on the Internet.
Right.
I Dunno.

244
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.830
That's like when every year we are watch shows Meekum car auctions.

245
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.700
You know when somebody spends 500 grand on a fucking Mustang,

246
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.200
I mean you're either,
you're either evading taxes or you're a wife beater,

247
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.510
one of the other.
Okay.
But you are either cheat,

248
00:15:15.511 --> 00:15:19.220
cheating the fucking system or your wife is scared to death of you that she's,

249
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:20.600
she'll let you fucking do that.

250
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:25.601
Blow a million and a half bucks on a humidor looking at Ani in a great Saint

251
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.810
Paul look at the top of his head comes off

252
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.050
like after a fucking autopsy.
Um,
anyways,

253
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.800
so I didn't came,
can't remember the hell I was talking about here.
Oh.

254
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.080
So we end up having to just having this great anytime I work with for Z,

255
00:15:43.081 --> 00:15:46.730
we have a great fucking time.
Um,
when we were up in Portland after the show,

256
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:51.590
we had a great time working there,
the uh,
the Elvis venue there and um,

257
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.470
we ended up going up to this bar afterwards and game three of the Stanley Cup

258
00:15:57.471 --> 00:15:58.970
finals and uh,

259
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.100
the UFC fights were both on and Jesus Christ,
Dan fucking Henderson.

260
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.590
Do you guys see that knock out?
That was like some Bourne identity shit.

261
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.670
He threw a kick,
went passed the guy and then fucking threw an elbow.

262
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.030
Like he was training in a phone booth.
I've never seen anything like that.

263
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.220
And Ryan,
a long time ago,

264
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.920
I saw a UFC fighter basically throw a left hook,
but he did it with his knee.

265
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.830
He fucking got rocked in their head.

266
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.020
I think it was that guy that used to call the little bottle,

267
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.070
a little ball of hate,
the hell was his name.

268
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.310
One of my favorite fighters back then.
Right.

269
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.370
He had his hair dyed like bright red fire engine red and he got rocked and he

270
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.790
started to go down and the other guy was so excited to jump on and start hitting

271
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:51.440
him that he kind of just went in with his hands down a little bit and the

272
00:16:51.441 --> 00:16:55.490
fucking guy was able to regroup and he just,
I can't explain it.
He threw it.

273
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.880
He need the guy in their head,
but he like came from the side.

274
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.810
He threw a hook that's fucking guy went down,

275
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.100
gave him the old right there.
Fred with the left knee,
Dan Anderson,

276
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:10.760
the same fucking thing.
This guy was just,

277
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.420
he was getting punched in the head repeatedly and everybody in the bars got,

278
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:17.630
oh right.
And I'm yelling and I actually for once,

279
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.620
because I don't know shit about fighting,
I will go,

280
00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:23.380
but he's fucking eat and those punches,
I'll look at them and uh,
the next,

281
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.430
you know,
it kicks the guy in the fucking head.

282
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.510
He kicked him in the head and then somehow he was like parallel to the guy's

283
00:17:29.511 --> 00:17:34.010
head and he gave me fucker near with the elbow and the guy just went down.

284
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:37.940
That was it over.
And then the coolest thing ever was,
his family was there,

285
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.610
you know,
tell me,
you don't have the coolest dad ever.

286
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.620
Guy Goes shirtless in the ring,

287
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.940
eats fucking 12 punches to the head and then knocks the other guy out.
You know?

288
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.830
You know,
it was funny.
He was in better shape than his.

289
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.480
<v 1>He's a 45 year old guys.
Should have the dad bod.</v>

290
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.410
He's up there as shredded.
His kids are coming up,
you know,

291
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:01.410
he's making them look soft.
That's the ending was soft.
I'm just saying,

292
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:03.720
usually by the time you're 45,
you have three,
four kids.

293
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.970
You just got that 600 yard stare.
Like,

294
00:18:05.971 --> 00:18:09.330
you don't give a fuck if you're eating a twinkie or a fucking tube sock,

295
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:13.410
you know,
and this guy is up there,
just was shredded.
So once again,
once again,

296
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.260
the UFC completely the fucking money
he paid to get in.

297
00:18:18.261 --> 00:18:20.300
I missed all the other phone.
Oh No,
I saw the uh,

298
00:18:20.301 --> 00:18:23.570
the championship one with a guy there that I've been watching ever since.

299
00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:28.310
He was on the ultimate fighter,
the guy from Manchester,
England.
Ah,
fuck.

300
00:18:28.311 --> 00:18:32.870
I got to get his name here.
God dammit.
Um,
I,
you know,

301
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.570
I realized when he won,
I had been saying his last name wrong forever.

302
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.590
UFC Champ Manchester.

303
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:45.350
Here we go.
What's his name?
Michael Bisbing.
I was,
I was Biz Bane.

304
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.060
Michael Bisman,
he fucking one.
That was another great one.
Um,

305
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.520
what a night.
And then as we,

306
00:18:52.521 --> 00:18:56.510
and as we're watching that simultaneously they're watching.
Uh,

307
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.610
well I guess I was probably the only one really watching it,

308
00:18:58.611 --> 00:18:59.810
but I was watching the uh,

309
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.610
Penguins San Jose and I'm looking at this shit going like holy fuck,

310
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.490
it's two to one that carrying the play and all of a sudden they get a high
stick.

311
00:19:10.491 --> 00:19:12.110
I think it was a four minute power play.

312
00:19:12.111 --> 00:19:15.620
They seem like they were on the power play for fucking ever long story short

313
00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:20.621
through up to two to one in the game and there was like they killed off like

314
00:19:21.431 --> 00:19:24.970
all,
all fucking 20 minutes of this penalty.
It seemed like a 20 minute penalty.

315
00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:27.310
Right.
They killed his fucking thing off.

316
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.480
This is like two seconds left and all I'm thinking in my head is if they kill

317
00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:32.530
off this penalty,

318
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.960
they're going to win this game and they're going to win the cup.

319
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:40.020
This is the fucking series and it's over three to score out of nowhere.

320
00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.350
I don't know it,
I don't know if it was tipped or whatever.

321
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.940
After San Jose's goalie made this one of the sickest fucking like saved it with

322
00:19:48.941 --> 00:19:52.550
like the inside of his forearm,
you know,
a few minutes early.

323
00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:57.551
And then at any let that one go in little bit of a floater and now it's two

324
00:19:58.041 --> 00:20:02.510
games to one.
Right.
And I don't give a fuck either way.
My team's out of it.

325
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.470
And then my surrogate team has also a lot of it all I know is that means that

326
00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:11.050
there's going to be at least one more game,
a hockey right as far as,
rather than,

327
00:20:11.051 --> 00:20:13.450
than just going for games,
that'll go five.
Right.

328
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.100
So we at least got two more games,
which is good for me because,
uh,
when,

329
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:23.790
when the NHL and the NBA seasons and I have like a sort of sports panic attack

330
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.110
because they haven't watched been watching baseball.

331
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.210
I don't know what the fuck's going on in baseball,

332
00:20:28.211 --> 00:20:31.770
but all I know it's like the middle of the season,
you know,
Diet.

333
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:32.740
Here's the rubber game,

334
00:20:32.741 --> 00:20:37.390
just a all outside and you're gonna see that Slat or a lot this afternoon.

335
00:20:37.391 --> 00:20:38.200
You know,
after you,

336
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.490
this went from like watching people win championships and playing at that level.

337
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.660
Um,
that's why the NFL is the shit as far as like,

338
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.460
it actually compete with October baseball because you figured that the middle of

339
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.940
the NFL season would be boring.
Like most,
most sports,

340
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:58.780
the middle of the season is boring when you play like 80 to 162 gangs.

341
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:02.980
But NFL only play 16 games.
Every game means so fucking much,

342
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.200
you know?
Um,

343
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.420
<v 0>okay.</v>

344
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.370
<v 1>Plus Tom Brady ought to be coming back from his nice rest,
a nice rest,
relaxed,</v>

345
00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:15.660
pissed off.
Tom Brady coming back to light you up again.
You know,

346
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.490
you guys can look under the rocks and try to figure out what he's doing someday,

347
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.980
someday you will admit that he fucking was,
you know,
I was just a shit.

348
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.960
Um,
and then the saddest thing obviously the weekend was,
uh,

349
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.910
was the death of Muhammad Ali.
Man,
that guy,
if,

350
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.220
if you've never watched when we were kings.

351
00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:39.983
<v 0>MMM.</v>

352
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.600
<v 1>I used to watch,
I used to own that thing and I used to,
I wore it out.</v>

353
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.940
I had it on VHS then he had on a DVD and I just,

354
00:21:45.941 --> 00:21:49.510
I've watched it so many fucking times.
I just,
um,

355
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.830
<v 0>okay.</v>

356
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.210
<v 1>I don't even know how to put the guy in the words.</v>

357
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.250
It was literally like one out of,
I watched it.
I was like,

358
00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:58.990
I have not done shit with my life.
The guy was unbelievable.
And when I to,

359
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:03.290
I tweeted,
you know,
greatest of all time,
greatest athlete,
ambassador,

360
00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:07.310
human being of all time and all these,
you know,
Twitter cons,
come on bill.

361
00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:11.960
He just,
he hit things in a ring.
It's like,
no,
he didn't,
he didn't,

362
00:22:11.961 --> 00:22:13.970
he did so much stuff beyond that.

363
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.620
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

364
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.070
<v 1>Like,
you know,
it says how great mom and I leave was like,</v>

365
00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:22.610
when I said greatest human ever,
it said,
really?
They're like better than Gandhi.

366
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.790
And it's like,
exactly.
Exactly.

367
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:31.760
If I said fucking Tom Brady,
you know,
greatest ever you,
you,

368
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.200
you just going to bring up other quarterbacks.

369
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.370
You had to bring up fucking Gandhi.
This is a goddamn athlete.

370
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.070
That's a good comparison.

371
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:45.220
Cause he was doing Gandy Shit outside of the ring and he could knock out anybody

372
00:22:45.351 --> 00:22:45.861
in the world.

373
00:22:45.861 --> 00:22:50.210
The guy could hold court and the poorest of the poor right up to the White
House.

374
00:22:50.211 --> 00:22:54.560
When he walked in,
he lit up the room.
Everybody shut up and you never forgot it.

375
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.510
And uh,
and on top of that,
he was one of the greatest fighters of all time,

376
00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:00.680
if not the greatest.

377
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.193
<v 0>MMM.</v>

378
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.210
<v 1>And I got so much out of when I used to watch that you don't,</v>

379
00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:07.800
when he was talking all that shit.

380
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.313
<v 0>MMM.</v>

381
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.210
<v 1>It was like,
he was almost,
as much as he was talking shit,
he was like,</v>

382
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.530
it was like self help.

383
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.130
It's not the way it's done today where today it's just all like,

384
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.950
it's all perverted.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

385
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.830
you know what's going to happen if you say the crazy shit.

386
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.810
You know that your hype and the fight,

387
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.970
you know that you're going to get a sneaker deal.

388
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:29.080
You know all this money's coming.

389
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:32.200
I'm not saying that he didn't know that on some level,
but

390
00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:33.510
<v 0>okay.</v>

391
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.190
<v 1>The shit that that guy went through.</v>

392
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.333
<v 0>MMM.</v>

393
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.080
<v 1>If you watch some of those early,</v>

394
00:23:39.081 --> 00:23:40.340
especially the ones that are in black and white,

395
00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:43.280
the fucking white reporters is so God damn racist.
It's like ridiculous.

396
00:23:43.281 --> 00:23:47.510
I remember when he just going and and going and this reporter's gets white guys

397
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:50.960
getting fucking Matt.
He just hates his confidence.
This guy,

398
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.470
like if this guy could have got sent into the future,
he'd be a hater on Twitter.

399
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:57.170
So he finally just goes,
do,
do,
do you ever stop talking?

400
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.630
I'll at least said something like now,

401
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.140
cause I'm knocking out all bumps and if you keep talking I'm knocking you out

402
00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:05.780
too.
And he just,
it was the greatest.

403
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:10.520
He just fucking piss the guy off and he knew what the guy was doing and he was

404
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:11.840
able to navigate all of that.

405
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:15.260
I know everybody says all the terrible shit that he did to Joe Frazier,

406
00:24:15.261 --> 00:24:17.660
but nobody gets out of this life without some bad shit.

407
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.740
Everybody's done some bad shit.
You know what I mean?
But,
um,

408
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.950
I dunno man,
he still had a good run though,
70,
74 years.
Um,

409
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.400
I used to watch them when I was a kid.
Man,
that's how fucking old I am.

410
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.700
That's what's freaking me out now was all these people that were like in their

411
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.920
twenties and thirties when I was a kid are now dying of like fucking old age and

412
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:42.650
shit.
David Bowie,
Mohammed Ali,

413
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.660
that's fucking freaking me out.
You know what I mean?

414
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.970
Maybe that's why that guy at the,
uh,

415
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.550
at the little cereal thing in the fucking at the airport was giving me that look

416
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.250
because he knows he's going to,
you know,

417
00:24:58.251 --> 00:25:02.480
everybody he knew is probably all dead right.

418
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.000
And He's thinking,
I only got so much time left to get cereal.
You know,

419
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.550
I was also thinking the fact that he felt so fucking like the little,

420
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.850
like the complete lack of patients that he had and I don't have patients,

421
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.270
the fact that that he couldn't wait two seconds for me to get some fucking

422
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:23.780
Cerios I was also thinking like that's probably why he's in this lounge.

423
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.300
This guy just fucking
take doesn't take no for an answer.
He's a lunatic.

424
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.400
Um,
I don't know.

425
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:33.800
That's kind of fucking depressing shit that'll be talking about death.

426
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.690
Cause I gotta tell you though,

427
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.510
I like the amount of fucking people that have died in the last goddamn year,

428
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.030
that I am old enough to have been a teenager and seeing them in their fucking

429
00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:48.470
prime.
Um,
how about that Prince Shit?
Huh?

430
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.180
Another person lost to the opiates and stuff.
I just can't put my,
it's like,

431
00:25:53.181 --> 00:25:54.014
I can't believe it,

432
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.970
but the fact that they actually come at him and they come at fame and celebrity

433
00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:00.410
and all that type of shit,

434
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.220
like people are fucking dying.

435
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.590
Regular people are dying because of that drug.
However the fuck you say,

436
00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:12.050
fentanyl or whatever the hell it is,
they get it.
Then the prescription runs out.

437
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.510
They were addicted to opiates and then they get on heroin.

438
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.040
And the fact that they don't talk about the pharmaceutical companies at all is

439
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:24.041
because that's like 150 fucking zillion dollar business and they give money to

440
00:26:24.621 --> 00:26:26.840
the politicians and they advertise on TV.

441
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:32.110
So they make like prince out to be like this.

442
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.760
Um,
this famous guy that,
you know,

443
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.360
nobody could say no to.
I mean,
I might be wrong in this,

444
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:44.820
but I know he had at least one hip replacement if not two.

445
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.580
And if you ever watch the guy,
the guy never took a show off.

446
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:49.080
He was all over the fucking stage.

447
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:54.110
I imagine he was in pain and that's how that shit started was basically him

448
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:58.890
pouring his heart out on stage,
giving everybody 100%.

449
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.280
He wore out his fucking hips.
What's this?
James Brown did the same thing.

450
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:05.020
He had to get new hips.
Um,

451
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.500
fortunately by the time prince got the operation,

452
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:11.180
hopefully they were further along and uh,
but I,

453
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.270
I imagine he still had all kinds of pain and then I,
that's,
that's my guests.

454
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.150
But for the fact that people came at them,
some people,

455
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:22.260
the way that they came at him was,
uh,
I don't know,
considering the shows and,

456
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.250
and in the music that he left us,
I thought it was really fucking,
ah,

457
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.110
it's a little below the belt though.
When you say,

458
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.100
I think that's a little below the belt.
Have you guys seen this youtube video?

459
00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:35.310
My name is John Dacre.
You got to watch this thing.

460
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:39.420
I apologize cause it's going to be in your fucking head for the rest of the
time.

461
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.650
I'll,
I'll,
I'll post the,
um,
the video,

462
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.900
um,
to,
uh,
my,
my Twitter account.
He's singing,

463
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.360
he's singing a moray and he can't remember how to,

464
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.420
I can't stop watching this guy.
This guy,
I swear to God,

465
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:19.040
I think it's his first TV Gig.
Somebody was sick.

466
00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:22.340
I think they say at the beginning,
this guy fills in and if you look at him,

467
00:28:22.341 --> 00:28:24.800
he's literally having an out of body experience.

468
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.490
So it's so funny to me because I can relate to this person because the first

469
00:28:28.491 --> 00:28:31.550
time I did stand up I felt like I was watching myself.

470
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.410
I've fucked everything up and this guy,
just the way he says his name,

471
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.250
it's almost just,
he says like,

472
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.920
my name is John [inaudible].

473
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:44.330
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

474
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.163
<v 7>yeah.</v>

475
00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.740
<v 1>It's like,
it's like he was outside,</v>

476
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:53.470
so I think that might be my favorite part of the video is the one this fucking

477
00:28:53.471 --> 00:28:58.060
guy,
just the way he says his own name,
he didn't say,
my name is John Dacre.

478
00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:02.080
He goes,
my name's John Taker.
See,

479
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.640
I did it right the first time I,
and I just fucked it up.
Hey Yo,

480
00:29:04.641 --> 00:29:06.430
you gotta hear this.
You got to his fucking guy.

481
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.920
He says he's singing all these Jesus songs.
Hang on,
hang on.

482
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.540
<v 5>My name is John Dick or</v>

483
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:20.763
<v 7>yeah,</v>

484
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.240
<v 1>that's the funniest shit ever.
My name's John Taker.</v>

485
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.870
It's like he's watching his life,
like he already died

486
00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.700
and then he came back and he just got to
like,

487
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.530
he first time you ever realize my name,
my name is John Taker.

488
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.160
<v 3>That's my fucking name.</v>

489
00:29:43.161 --> 00:29:46.130
And this is my life and I'm on TV and I'm going to sing this song.

490
00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.010
This is what I did with my life.
And then you look at the guy,

491
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.930
fucking poor bastard.
Um,
anyways,

492
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.260
did Da,
k,
e r.
F.

493
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.790
If you're just listening now and you want to fucking watch it at work,

494
00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.800
um Oh my God,
listen to him sing.
Hallelujah.

495
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.810
Ugh.
Damn.
But for the grace of God,

496
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:31.060
this fucking guy would be the most interesting interview ever.
Just like,

497
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.710
he's one of the most fascinating people I've ever seen.
Like what the,

498
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.710
what is going on in between those fucking ears right now?
I think if they could,

499
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:42.520
if you could make a show about his fucking thoughts,
you know,

500
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:45.820
all these fucking movies.
Oh,
it's,
yeah.
You know,
they show the movie,

501
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:49.630
but it's done in reverse.
And then they try to fucking flip you out.
Nothing.

502
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.420
Nothing pink Floyd could ever fucking right.

503
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.020
Can match what's going on in this guy's head.
Highly recommended.
All right,

504
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.530
let's read 'em.
Let's read some,

505
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:02.860
a little bit of a average days in there.
Um,

506
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.850
<v 8>bells will ring,
ring and doing a doing that some more.</v>

507
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:12.540
<v 3>Um,
what the fuck is the God damn,
my name is John Taker.</v>

508
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:16.980
All right.
Oh,
me undies.
Me undies.

509
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.330
No more sweaty taint,
dude.
Dude,
me undies,
me undies.

510
00:31:21.331 --> 00:31:22.170
There's so dry.

511
00:31:22.171 --> 00:31:26.820
You're gonna Faint and fall into a puddle Dick fucking first.

512
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.730
But don't fucking worry.
Your underwear was absorb it.

513
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:34.590
Just like one of those pamper commercials.
Throw it in to the ocean.
Oh yeah.

514
00:31:34.591 --> 00:31:37.860
And kill a bunch of fucking dolphins.
All right.
Mandy's everybody,

515
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.430
whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

516
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.910
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear,

517
00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.560
but instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his everyday

518
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.980
clothes,
your pro,
your underwear is probably boring.

519
00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:56.580
is here to change that.
Uh,

521
00:32:00.781 --> 00:32:04.260

522
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.053
<v 6>right?</v>

523
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.870
<v 3>It's like a one syllable word like bike,
you know,
bicycle.</v>

524
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:15.730
It's on the sick,
right?
What was on the buy?
Oh,

Anyways,

525
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.270

I'll tell you right now,</v>

528
00:32:25.101 --> 00:32:28.820
John Drake or didn't have on me undies,
even if he did not even modal,

529
00:32:28.821 --> 00:32:31.880
could fucking absorb the sweat pouring down his fucking balls.

530
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:38.180
Nothing can describe the fit of the fields of me undies,
feeling me undies.

531
00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.010
Don't you to try them on.

532
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.390
You'll understand while they are called the world's most comfortable underwear.

533
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:45.920
Uh,

535
00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:53.810
species,
right?
Baby Seal fucking briefs.

536

if you need to hire help,
each state has its own employment laws.

590

I right,
got it out of the fucking way.
Here we go.

616
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.780
Let's get back to the podcast.
Um,
all right.

617
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:47.610
Let's read some of the letters for this week.

618
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.180
We're going to leave some of the rent.
Oh,
before we,
before I do though,
the uh,

619
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.920
Jesus Christ,
poor Jason Law man after game one.

620
00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.540
He's a Cleveland Guy after game one.
I can't even say game one.

621
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:04.230
After the first fucking quarter,
this guy was sending me texts,

622
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:06.660
he had like his head in the oven and I'm like,
Jesus Christ,
dude,

623
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:09.450
nobody fucking throws in the towel the way you did.

624
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.850
I remember back to back years,

625
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:16.851
I think in 84 the Lakers came out and blew out the Celtics in game one and we

626
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:18.210
came back and beat him.

627
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.860
And then the very next year we blew them out and gain one won by like 1520

628
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:26.520
fucking points.
And then the Lakers won.
So it was like for fuck sakes,

629
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.040
the Bruins were down o two to Vancouver.

630
00:38:29.041 --> 00:38:31.260
We ended up winning for the next five and we raised,

631
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.920
we fucking hoisted up the cup,
stop being such a negative.

632
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.660
And then after the game too,
when they lost by like fucking 30 or 35,

633
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.160
I wrote back to him,
I maybe you've got a point.
Yeah.

634
00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.820
Um,
I never say this app to two gains,

635
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:53.620
but this series is fucking over.
It's over man.
Just go,

636
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:58.390
go down.
If you live in Oakland,
just go fucking find a,
uh,
you know,

637
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:02.220
find a good spot for the championship parade.
This,
this is,
uh,
I dunno,

638
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.410
maybe they go back to Cleveland and then,
you know,

639
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.080
all the positivity from their fans seeps into,

640
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.720
I'm kidding.
Um,
here's a question.
I guess if you guys,

641
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:18.540
I didn't get why Trump got into so much fucking trouble.
You know,
I,

642
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.770
I will,
you know what I know,
cause he's a dope,

643
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:23.860
but like this stuff that they were saying that he said something racist,

644
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:28.690
right about the uh,
the judge Mexican American judge,
right.

645
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.660
Something about the fucking wall.
This is what I like to do.

646
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.220
And on a hot button issue in like this,

647
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:34.890
I just going to wade right in with barely,

648
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:39.100
even though in the facts it says Donald Trump's attacks on the judge,

649
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:40.780
uh,
are racist.

650
00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:45.340
He's quite literally saying the judge can't do his job because of his ethnicity.

651
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.700
This is the definition of racism.
I guess.

652
00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:53.200
He was doing some debate going on about that wall that he wants to build and

653
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:57.310
this judge who is Mexican American was going to rule on it and I think Trump

654
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:59.830
said that he didn't want him to because he was Mexican.

655
00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:03.550
He was going to be biased.
So everybody's said that that was racist.

656
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.830
So here's my question
as a Joe 12 pack,

657
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.260
I'm not Joe six pack Joe 12 pack.
Um,

658
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.020
<v 2>okay.</v>

659
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:19.730
<v 3>Basically what he did there is far as I could tell,
is how they picked juries.</v>

660
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.690
Isn't that how they always pick a jury?
You know what I mean?

661
00:40:23.691 --> 00:40:28.610
Like if you go down for jury duty and the defendant is black as a white dude,

662
00:40:28.611 --> 00:40:31.940
yet the,
I'm not,
I'm not going to get picked for this jury or the,
the,

663
00:40:31.941 --> 00:40:36.890
the defending defendant,
uh,
attorney doesn't want me on there.

664
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.420
Right?
Isn't that how they picked the whole,
Oh Jess,
how they always do it.

665
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.300
If it's a domestic violence case,

666
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:49.340
let's try to get as many women there as possible.
You know,

667
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:54.740
I think they hide it by goal because I think that they can understand women also

668
00:40:54.741 --> 00:40:56.990
now they're hoping to win the fucking case.

669
00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:02.050
So what they do is they stack the deck with enough people of the same ilk as the

670
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:06.650
defendant right now.
Don't they do that?
Am I nuts here?

671
00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.860
I believe that that's what they do.
So

672
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:15.400
I thought it was kind of ironic that they within the court system that if,

673
00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.410
if Trump is saying that,

674
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.970
it's like Trump's picking his jury to try to get the fucking wall.

675
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:27.300
And what he wants is he wants a bunch of fucking white people who like a white

676
00:41:27.911 --> 00:41:31.320
guy goes over big disco degree to get,
Oh you,
you,
you,

677
00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.330
you watch how great it's going to be.
Like he wants

678
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.630
the mouth breathing morons that like him on his jury.

679
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.850
That's all he was saying as far as I could tell.
Right.

680
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.330
Not saying the guy's not racist,
but I thought that that one,

681
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.160
they were stretching the bounds a little bit.

682
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.470
Now I'm just asking a fucking question here.

683
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:51.830
Before you fucking edit this thing and make me look like the next Hitler,

684
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.560
but I was watching that story.
I'm just going like,
yeah,

685
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:59.150
that's kind of how courts work.
That's kind of exactly how it works.

686
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.220
And not to mention when the Oj verdict came in,

687
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:08.390
white people like what the fuck it black people were freaking out having a

688
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:11.030
parade.
That's why they do it.
Right.

689
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:15.800
Everybody watches it and you put yourself in the position of weapons there.

690
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.930
I watched the Oj trial.
I'm fucking,
I got my throat slashed.
Right?

691
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.760
Black people watch it and they go,
yeah,
I got off.
That's how I look at it.

692
00:42:25.761 --> 00:42:27.860
I don't know and I don't think that's wrong either.

693
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.930
It's like watching sports except it's people's freedom.
Um,

694
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.730
alright.
Scandinavia.
Hey Billy burbles.
Uh,

695
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.380
is it true that you're not going to come to Scandinavia?

696
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:47.570
Me and my lady are huge fans and was really hoping fee for you to come to Sweden

697
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:48.830
this summer.
Slash.
Fall.

698
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:52.820
I just need to know if I need to book some plane tickets to the Netherlands,

699
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.870
then this is going to cost me like one grand for us to see your shit.

700
00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.370
But I'll bet it's worth it.

701
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.050
But I just need to know if you're planning to come to Scandinavia some point in

702
00:43:03.051 --> 00:43:03.501
the future.

703
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:07.250
Otherwise love your shit and looking forward to F is for family season too.

704
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.510
Well thank you very much.

705
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:15.410
<v 1>F is for family season two is the reason why on this trip I'm not going to,</v>

706
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.710
uh,
Scandinavia.

707
00:43:17.711 --> 00:43:22.030
So like there's like three chunks.
Okay.

708
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:26.770
There's the my pasty people,
which is coming in first.

709
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:28.990
You know,
just like the jury

710
00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.550
<v 3>does this mean I'm a,
I'm a,</v>

711
00:43:30.551 --> 00:43:34.420
I'm a racist the way I'm touring against other white people.
Um,
no,

712
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.470
it's just how it worked up.

713
00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:40.060
And then I probably would be do the Scandinavian thing next and then hopefully

714
00:43:40.061 --> 00:43:41.300
eastern Europe.
That's what I,
I am

715
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:43.460
<v 1>hoping to do.
Um,</v>

716
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.840
this show takes up way more time than I thought it would,
but like they,

717
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:52.310
I had a list of 29 cities that wanted to bring me over there and I could have

718
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:57.230
gone on a month long fucking crazy ass tour.
Um,

719
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.250
uh,
broken it up into two.
But I think the way my workload is now,

720
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.300
I have to break it into three,
but like I am absolutely coming back there again.

721
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.320
It's a beautiful country.
Um,
I love it.

722
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.360
You know who the fuck doesn't want to go there?

723
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:14.840
I've been in like two or three times and uh,
I'll definitely come back.

724
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:18.830
I just don't know when,
um,
I can't promise you as to when,

725
00:44:18.831 --> 00:44:23.300
but I am definitely going to come back and,
uh,
I dunno.

726
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.240
Other than that,
I don't have any more information.
So save your money,
dude.

727
00:44:28.241 --> 00:44:32.070
Don't blow a grant.
Don't blow grant coming to see me with Shit and Dick Jokes.

728
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.880
<v 3>I'll,
I'll,
I'll come your way.
All right.
Don't worry about it.
Okay.</v>

729
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.150
X men billboard.
Hey billion.

730
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.280
This is fucking nerd shit.
Uh,
nerd shit.
So please bear with me.

731
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.120
There's a new x men movie and Rose McGowan,

732
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.010
the chick who used to date Marilyn Manson has her tits in an uproar over this

733
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:57.450
billboard because between mystique a woman and apocalypse,

734
00:44:57.451 --> 00:45:01.500
it dude,
if you don't want to click on the link from some Weirdo,
you don't,

735
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.320
don't know.
Uh,
no problem.
Just a picture.

736
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:09.030
Just picture a blue dude holding up a naked blue woman by the throat to the

737
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:13.020
point or feet aren't on the ground contexts apocalypse.

738
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.560
The dude is a bad ass villain in the movie and Mystique.

739
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:21.310
The woman is the leading lady and Badass heroine in the movie.
Um,

740
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:25.500
here's the problem.
Rose McGowan says,
this is promoting violence against women,

741
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.930
which I feel is horseshit.
Here's why.

742
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.610
If it was Hugh Jackman Slash Wolverine being choked out and held up,

743
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:35.280
no problem.
The point of the posters,
a show,

744
00:45:35.281 --> 00:45:37.950
how dangerous slash how much of the threat the villain,

745
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:41.130
how much of a threat the villain is.
It's not a political statement.

746
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.590
Here's my issue with this though.

747
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:48.650
How does a studio slash movie maker when Suppose Wolverine was the leading hero

748
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.960
was a women would be co women would be complaining that it's always a man as the

749
00:45:56.161 --> 00:46:00.930
hero and women are more like backup or support roles.
I mean,

750
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.430
Ms Mystique is bad ass.
She's leading the fight against this guy.

751
00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:08.400
To me that's empowering to women.
Uh,

752
00:46:08.401 --> 00:46:12.270
she has an a sex symbol in the movie though Jennifer Lawrence who plays her is

753
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:14.460
really attractive.
She's just strong and a leader.

754
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.270
All I can think is that they wanted her standing

755
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:24.030
all,
all I can think is that they want her standing on the neck of the villain.

756
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.600
But this,
but that's fucking stupid.
For promotional posters.

757
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:33.540
You couldn't have her be the villain and holding up a man hero because that

758
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:37.920
would be some kind of anti woman.
All women are evil campaign instead.
Right.

759
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:38.760
Where you lost me here,

760
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:44.160
you couldn't have her be the villain and holding up a man hero.
Oh,

761
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:44.990
I see.
If she,
if,

762
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:49.440
if the female character was evil and then was holding up the guy character,

763
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.190
they couldn't do that because then they would be saying,
oh,
it'd be antique,

764
00:46:53.191 --> 00:46:56.270
be considered anti women.
All women are evil.
Um,

765
00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.930
I guess what bothers me is that it just seems like there's no way to please any

766
00:47:00.931 --> 00:47:05.880
non white male.
Lately,
uh,
women wanted a strong female hero.
They got one,

767
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.580
but she's in danger of the villain.
A man,

768
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:12.780
somehow that equals violence on women when it's really just about violence in

769
00:47:12.781 --> 00:47:15.540
general or war or conflict or whatever.
I mean,

770
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:18.720
the dude isn't slapping her for over cooking a steak.

771
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.950
He's trying to conquer the world.

772
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:26.430
She's trying to stock stop him and he's choking her ass.
How,

773
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.800
how is that a gender issue?
Um,

774
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:34.420
all right.
Uh,
let me see.
Let me see if I can find the picture of this year.

775
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.440
I did look at it,
uh,
uh,

776
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.480
library.
No,
that's not the f I always click on the wrong one.

777
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.063
<v 6>Okay.</v>

778
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.500
<v 3>Yeah.
I actually,
you know,
when I heard it,
I thought it was bullshit,</v>

779
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:52.110
but then I saw the poster,
the movie clip that I saw.

780
00:47:52.111 --> 00:47:56.340
I don't see your feet dangling off of it.
Um,
I,

781
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:59.760
I see why they did that.
I understand why that they did it that way.

782
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.070
What happens is when you're writing,

783
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.340
what I'm learning is when you're writing something you're so fucking focused on

784
00:48:05.341 --> 00:48:10.341
is the story tracking from point a to point B to point c and we land this thing

785
00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:13.830
without crashing into the fucking ocean.
Um,

786
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.100
that they wouldn't think that anybody who,
you know,

787
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.300
might have a problem with that.
Um,
I understand,
I understand.
I,

788
00:48:21.301 --> 00:48:24.000
this is actually one of those ones I get why they don't want to see that.

789
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.780
But in defense of view,
if,
how about this?

790
00:48:27.781 --> 00:48:32.220
If the guy character,
the fucking Apollo Guy,
whatever his fucking name is,

791
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.720
was a apocalypse,
such dumb names,

792
00:48:36.721 --> 00:48:40.950
apocalypse mystique,
all sound like bad cologne.

793
00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:42.493
Um,

794
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:50.340
um,
anyways,
if,
if apocalypse was holding a,

795
00:48:50.341 --> 00:48:53.100
the Wolverine Hugh Jackman by the throat now,

796
00:48:53.101 --> 00:48:57.000
would that be promoting male on male violence?

797
00:48:57.001 --> 00:49:00.390
Would there be more a bar room brawls because of that?

798
00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:06.060
I honestly
don't think it promotes violence.

799
00:49:06.061 --> 00:49:07.320
I think,
um,

800
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:13.520
like the level stupid that you'd have to be to look at apocalypse holding up,

801
00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:19.950
pulled in a woman by her throat and to say like,
oh,

802
00:49:19.951 --> 00:49:22.620
I guess it's okay to hit women.
Now I'm going to start hitting women.

803
00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.150
If you are that fucking stupid,
by the time you got to you,

804
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.720
unless she was riding in the car,
let's see,

805
00:49:27.721 --> 00:49:31.200
you're driving home and now you're going to fucking choker because you saw this

806
00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:36.201
apocalypse guy choking a fucking mistake.

807
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.753
Right?

808
00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.600
You'd also see another thousand signs on the way home and next thing you know,

809
00:49:42.601 --> 00:49:45.960
I dunno,
you'd be in a car dealership buying something or uh,

810
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:49.740
getting a fucking Mcdonald's sandwich.
I think you would forget if you were that,

811
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:53.400
like if your brain was like that,
uh,
influenced,

812
00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:58.620
but having said that,
a looking at the,
um,
the poster,
I ain't,
I don't,

813
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:03.240
I understand why they would just like,
you know,
that's not the greatest image.

814
00:50:03.241 --> 00:50:07.140
You could have another image up there.
Yeah.
I don't have a problem with them.

815
00:50:07.141 --> 00:50:11.580
Changing it,
but I definitely understand your,
um,
your points on that thing.
But,

816
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:16.170
uh,
you know,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't fuck it though.
It's,

817
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.890
it's just the time that we're living in.
Everybody gets offended.

818
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:24.130
Everybody doesn't get offended.
A small group of people gets offended.

819
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.980
And I'm the news covers,

820
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.813
<v 1>you know,</v>

821
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.420
because what are they going to talk about to fucking how the drug companies in a

822
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:36.740
round about way killed prince,
you know?
I mean,

823
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.130
what are they gonna talk about that again,

824
00:50:39.131 --> 00:50:43.040
to talk about fracking and then people didn't fucking up the water supply that

825
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:46.100
he,
there's too much money involved in that.
Okay.
But you know,

826
00:50:46.101 --> 00:50:47.720
if you've got a group of fucking soccer,

827
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:51.890
mom's upset about a fucking blue woman getting held up by a guy who appears to

828
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:56.060
be made out of stone.
I'm in a movie,
you know,
that's gonna make it.

829
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.690
That's gonna make it.
You do a Caitlyn Jenner joke in a fucking strip mall.
Yeah,

830
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:03.800
that's going to get on the fucking news.
But real shit that matters.
Now,

831
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.760
that's not gonna happen.
You know,
that's not going to,
well,
why,
why now?

832
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.003
Why would you do that?

833
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.250
That's just another one of those back burners stories that they just stick on

834
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:16.910
the front burner all the fucking time.
Like they,
I mean,
I'm not saying like,

835
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:20.330
you know,
violence against women isn't a major issue,
but I'm just saying like,

836
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:22.850
people aren't,
is simplistic.

837
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:27.220
Is that like they don't fucking look at something and like,
um,

838
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.940
I dunno is a kid like the amount of violence that I watched when I was growing

839
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:34.460
up,
you know what I mean?

840
00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.580
All the fucking shows that I've watched,

841
00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:41.510
I've yet to chase somebody down an alley,
pull him off a fence,
chain link fence,

842
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.810
beat him up or even slide over the hood of a car.

843
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.090
I saw all those images when I was growing up.

844
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:51.020
I used to pretend and play war and all that shit.
I never fucking killed anybody.

845
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.990
I've never hit a woman.
I never did any of that.
I think what,
you know,

846
00:51:53.991 --> 00:51:57.320
what it is is what really makes you do shit like that is,

847
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:01.580
is horrific fucking parents.
I think that that's what it is.

848
00:52:01.581 --> 00:52:03.080
And now they're trying to blame the signs,

849
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:06.290
the sign that's going to be up for all of fucking two weeks when this movie's

850
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:06.620
out,

851
00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:10.490
as opposed to your dad and mom and their relationship that you grow up for the

852
00:52:10.491 --> 00:52:14.240
first 18 years of your life fucking watch.
And,
but you know,

853
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:18.140
you can't blame those people because those people buy things on the channel.

854
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.611
You know what I mean?

855
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:23.900
So you always give them a pass and then you rub their balls and you call him Joe

856
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.260
Sixpack and fucking,
uh,
the true heroes,
you know,

857
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:30.140
they're always rubbing their balls like they give a fuck about them.
They don't,

858
00:52:30.141 --> 00:52:31.700
they just want their money.
You know what I mean?

859
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:36.860
That's why corporations act like all of these non crisis is our absolute crisis

860
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.340
crisis disease because they don't want to lose a fucking dime.

861
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:44.900
So if anybody bitches,
anybody Moans,
anybody complains,
they fucking cave in.

862
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:49.070
And then a lot of these groups are aware of that.
And when they get to,
uh,

863
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.580
to get a corporation to cave,
it gives them like it,

864
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.880
it's almost like a video game.
It gives them more life and,
uh,

865
00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.620
they'd taken more seriously.
So it's a giant,
it's a giant fucking game.

866
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.970
You know,
at the end of the day it's say it's,

867
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:06.740
it's two people that don't fucking exist,
but,
um,

868
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.790
I don't know.
There's something,
there's a look on her face.

869
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:12.140
She doesn't look bad ass there.

870
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:14.900
It makes me feel bad for her and I want to help her.

871
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.770
So maybe what they should have done,

872
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:23.600
she should have had a more fucking a Rhonda Rousey look on her face and maybe

873
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.020
was pulling bex on his fucking,
are those corn

874
00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:29.130
<v 3>rows?
What the fuck does he have?
Was it wavy hair?
I can't,</v>

875
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:33.510
I don't know what this guy's made out of his fucking claymation hair.

876
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:35.040
She should have.
She should be like,
you know,

877
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:38.940
maybe gouge in his eyes a little bit.
I Dunno.
I was kidding who.

878
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:39.970
They'd still fucking complain.

879
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.863
<v 0>MMM.</v>

880
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:47.730
<v 3>If you really want to get them going,
just
have that picture right there,</v>

881
00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:48.840
that image.
Now.

882
00:53:48.841 --> 00:53:53.150
I'm not going to tell you to do that because there's no sense of humor anymore.

883
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.310
I was gonna I was gonna say that.
Maybe you could take that image and say like,

884
00:53:56.311 --> 00:53:57.144
um,

885
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.000
<v 0>okay.</v>

886
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.170
<v 3>No,
don't built down it's,
it's dump asked me at a show.</v>

887
00:54:02.171 --> 00:54:05.680
I'll tell you what it was going to say.
All right.
Hey Billy,
dope.
Billy.

888
00:54:05.681 --> 00:54:09.580
The fucking dope.
Can Women Forget Mr. Nice Guy.

889
00:54:09.581 --> 00:54:13.810
Persona A.
Hey,
I'm really having a difficult reading today.
All right,

890
00:54:13.811 --> 00:54:18.190
big fan from Lithuania.
That's another one on the list that I got to get to.
A,

891
00:54:18.191 --> 00:54:19.270
you're a great comedian.

892
00:54:19.271 --> 00:54:23.210
It would be great if you ever decided to do you stand up here in the Baltics.
Um,

893
00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.160
that will happen at some point in my career.
Hopefully sooner rather than later.

894
00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:29.470
All right.
The guy says,
I got it.
This dilemma,

895
00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:33.100
can a woman forget your past as a nice guy.

896
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:38.970
One of my former classmates is coming back to my hometown on summer vacation for

897
00:54:39.281 --> 00:54:44.230
a few weeks and let's say I'd like to get intimate with her while she's here.

898
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.080
Now,
the thing is,
when we were still in school,

899
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:50.440
I had a mad crush on this girl for years.
However,

900
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.860
Shit didn't work out because I didn't know how the life works,

901
00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:59.620
how the females work.
And also I was a little bitch,
Mister Nice guy.

902
00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:01.240
<v 0>Uh,</v>

903
00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.660
<v 3>I beat my younger self.
That was possible.
All right,</v>

904
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:09.720
you're doing some good therapy here.
Uh,
but for over the years,
uh,

905
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:13.020
but over the years that I've spent in our capital city city,

906
00:55:13.021 --> 00:55:17.490
I can safely say that my view and attitude towards females and masculinity,

907
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.670
masculinity has changed significantly.
What do you think?

908
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:25.410
Can a woman brush off the image of a nice guy or are you forever marked with the

909
00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:29.190
certain character traits in her eyes?
Um,

910
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:32.700
yeah,
I think you're,
you're kind of fucked.

911
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.460
Just put it this way.

912
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:40.490
Like take like the actor that played like Urkel or something like that.

913
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.360
It's like you're typecast,
you know,

914
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.760
an Urkel could literally become an army fucking ranger and then leave the

915
00:55:50.761 --> 00:55:54.840
military.
And when he went to go do a fucking action movie,

916
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.680
they bough fucking article.
Give me a fucking break.
Right.

917
00:55:58.681 --> 00:56:03.210
It's just the problem is what you gotta do.
Look,

918
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.970
you always got to take,
you go,
he's got to take a bat.

919
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:09.690
What you're going to have to do when you get up there,

920
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.550
you're going to have to crowd the plate.
No Kid,
which I would just be,

921
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:20.060
you're going to have to be significantly different to raise any sort of intrigue

922
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:24.880
in her,
you know what I mean?
Cause she probably just wants to meet up with you,

923
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.900
you know,
have a couple of ciders or whatever that,

924
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:31.330
whatever those drinks women have when they know that they're not gonna fuck you

925
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:34.600
up.
You know,
one of those fucking,
I want to feel warm.

926
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:37.390
You know they have that stupid sweater that covers their hands too when they

927
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:40.240
drink it with both hands out of a Mug,
you know,

928
00:56:40.241 --> 00:56:42.970
and it's just fucking over right there.
Like,
you know,

929
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.340
hit more on the waiter then the,
they didn't,
I mean listening to you,

930
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.380
you're going to have to lie.
I don't know.

931
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:48.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

932
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.970
<v 3>I Dunno what you gotta do.</v>

933
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.810
Go Buy yourself a Raiders of the lost Ark Leather jacket.

934
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:56.870
You got to try to come in and act like you've been fucking doing.

935
00:56:56.871 --> 00:56:57.704
So this is the thing,

936
00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:03.450
this is what's going to fuck you is you want this woman too bad.
All right?

937
00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.500
You got to not give a fuck.
Don't be,
don't be a deck,

938
00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:10.700
but just go in there and just,
hey,
what's going on?

939
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.940
What you been up to now and then talk about some of the shit you're doing.

940
00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:19.490
You know,
I don't know.
Look at your phone.
I this broad.
She's driving me crazy.

941
00:57:19.491 --> 00:57:22.420
I got the ladies all over me.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
Doty.

942
00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.730
I don't know what to tell you on this one.
Once you are typecast,

943
00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.640
it's fucking over dude.
You got to go behind the camera here.

944
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:33.080
You got to start directing or some shit cause I don't know what to tell you.

945
00:57:33.081 --> 00:57:38.060
Your rob.
This is what I would do.
Just know this going into it.

946
00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:42.500
You're fucked.
All right?
So there's no pressure.
Who gives a shit?

947
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:46.250
And uh,
I dunno.
I'll make her laugh and just tell,
you know,

948
00:57:46.251 --> 00:57:48.260
I'd always had a crush on you,
but I used to be a bitch,

949
00:57:48.261 --> 00:57:51.890
but I'm not a bitch anymore.
So what do you say?
What do you say?

950
00:57:51.891 --> 00:57:56.660
You come over here and a jump on my fuck enough.
You can't go that way,
but I,

951
00:57:56.661 --> 00:57:57.710

I would.
Um,

952
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.150
<v 2>okay.</v>

953
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:04.500
<v 3>Yeah,

That's a tough one.
I,
I,
you know,
maybe that's it.</v>

954
00:58:04.501 --> 00:58:08.280
Just trash your former self.
Yeah.
I used to be used to be a bitch,
you know,

955
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.780
I don't know how to do it,

You know what,

956
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:13.710
you've stumped me somewhere in there I think.

957
00:58:13.711 --> 00:58:18.480
I think the whole not giving a fuck and then trash in your former self and then

958
00:58:18.481 --> 00:58:21.780
just telling her that you had a crush on her.
Who knows?
Dude,

959
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:27.560
I dunno.
This a chance.
Maybe she likes you back then or,
I dunno.

960
00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:31.650
Women got that thing though,
Dude.

967
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:04.470
So he didn't get any of the,

970
00:59:12.991 --> 00:59:16.870

Everybody.
Hi.
Yes.
So basically he had a crush on this girl.

He was a nice guy.

976
00:59:36.151 --> 00:59:39.150
He got put in the friend zone and now she's coming back to town.

977
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:44.370
He's now living in the city.
He understands the male female dynamic better.
Okay.

978
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.900
And,
um,
the way he's wearing this,
he's been,
uh,
doing all right for himself.

979
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:52.620
But he still wants to bang this woman.
He's,
he,
his question is,

980
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:57.790
once you're in the friend zone like that.
Okay.

981
00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.100
Is it possible to get out of it?
Absolutely.
It is.
Oh Wow.
Okay.

982
01:00:02.101 --> 01:00:04.320
Cause I was going like,
I don't know,
I was saying to you like type cash,

983
01:00:04.321 --> 01:00:07.050
you're like Urkel and now you want to be the star of an action movie,

984
01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:11.140
<v 9>you know?
But yeah,
no,
I think you can,
but it's all,</v>

985
01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:13.300
it's all predicated on your behavior.

986
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.250
Like you don't want God to all of a sudden started at yeah.

987
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:18.000
<v 3>Seemed like an aloof,
a jerk or anything like that.</v>

988
01:00:18.001 --> 01:00:21.870
So I told him to buy a Raiders of the lost Ark Way.
Slink leather jacket.

989
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:25.380
Maybe get a hat and a whip.
Yeah.

990
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.010
Is that bad?
Uh,
I just

991
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.800
<v 9>think maybe you're a little less available perhaps.</v>

992
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.960
You know,
you know,
it can be a thing where she'll come to town and be like,

993
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:41.790
oh my God,
I could,
let's go here and do the dad.
I want to do this.
And then,

994
01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.230
you know,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
definitely.
Well,
we'll let me know when you're around.

995
01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:49.570
Yeah.
Maybe we can grab a drink or something,
keep it cash and um,

996
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.980
don't go in there like,
so I've been fucking a lot of broad stuff.

997
01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.410
<v 3>Not like that,
but just as she's talking about her life.</v>

998
01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.660
You talk about your life.
Yeah.
I haven't seen it.

999
01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.110
<v 9>Girls here in there,
I don't know.
Nothing too serious,</v>

1000
01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:07.140
but I've been having my fun.
But anyway,
what's going on with you?

1001
01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:10.570
You look good like that.
Like Neah Bay.

1002
01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.700
<v 3>That was good.
Oh,
were you,
were you,</v>

1003
01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:19.500
were you enjoying that just then that law and I am joined the,
the advice.

1004
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:23.970
Yeah,
that was good.
Thank Youas I was stammering.
I was like,
uh,

1005
01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.930
you might have to just fuck it.
I said,
your best thing you got going is,

1006
01:01:27.931 --> 01:01:30.990
you know you've got no shot,
so just don't give a fuck it,

1007
01:01:30.991 --> 01:01:34.300
just go in there and just be like,
but I still so true.
Yeah.

1008
01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.120
<v 9>You have to not get,
you can't go into it with expectations of anything.</v>

1009
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:45.090
I think you just be normal.
Be a friend like you have been.

1010
01:01:45.091 --> 01:01:50.040
But I think I have a friend who often gets friends owned it and I'm always

1011
01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:55.041
telling him that he needs to make himself less available because he always makes

1012
01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:58.050
himself available as them psychologically to women,
always

1013
01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:02.030
<v 3>available as well.
Theory.
And I know it will be considered sexist,</v>

1014
01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:02.880
so I'll listen to you.

1015
01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:06.660
<v 9>The same with men and women.
If you're less available,
like the peep,</v>

1016
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:10.710
people want you more.
And I think that's just how life is.

1017
01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:14.640
People like the hunt.
I think men like the hunt a little more.

1018
01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.620
So I think you should remember like the hunt.

1019
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.390
<v 3>It's like a pain.
I'd be like,
oh hey.
And I'd be like,
yeah,
you're not a hunter.</v>

1020
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:27.060
Gather.
No,

1021
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.500
I was just more like,

1022
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:35.070
I hate it when women played hard to get it was so it just,
it got so boring,

1023
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:37.860
so fucking fast.
I was just like,
Hey,
I can fucking,

1024
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:43.020
I'll just go rub one out and then I'll go watch a game and then you know,

1025
01:02:43.021 --> 01:02:46.690
something that I act it's,
you're not worth the fucking trouble.
Right.

1026
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:50.710
You know what I mean?
I just always found that like,
um,

1027
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:54.090
cause I remember when I would just start to walk away and then these girls would

1028
01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:58.230
be like,
no,
you're supposed to pull blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I was like,
oh,
I didn't,

1029
01:02:58.231 --> 01:03:02.310
I didn't get the script to where my like some fucking awful play right now.

1030
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.330
Right.
I walked away from a lot,
but I,
I,

1031
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:10.860
my number could have been so much higher.
I showed a chase and then chase,

1032
01:03:10.861 --> 01:03:14.280
I just tapped out.
I'd be like,
ah,
you know,
if you know what I understand,

1033
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:18.810
you know,
I wouldn't fuck me.
Oh,
hi.
Oh No.

1034
01:03:18.811 --> 01:03:20.670
Don't say that about yourself.

1035
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:25.320
People like you all write a bill dill pickle.

1036
01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:30.270
Um,
I love a good sandwich.
My question to you is,
if you were a sandwich,

1037
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.660
what type of sandwich would you be?
I think you already answered this one.

1038
01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:38.460
You could eat only one sandwich for the rest of your life.
What would you be?

1039
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.410
All right near.
Remind the listeners what kind of sandwich you think I am.

1040
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:48.390
I once compared to you to a grilled cheese sandwich.

1041
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:52.770
But the thing about said you were about as exotic is a grilled cheese sandwich.

1042
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.610
I was talking about that if,
if I ever went to prison,

1043
01:03:57.330 --> 01:04:00.990
the fact that I was a redhead on for the first time in my life,

1044
01:04:00.991 --> 01:04:05.970
I might be considered exotic.
Yeah.
And I thought you were grossly overestimating.

1045
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:10.860
I was joking about the fact that quickly I would be sexually assaulted in there.

1046
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:14.130
And you had to remind me that I'm a plain Jane.

1047
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:17.610
There wasn't even tomatoes on that fucking grilled cheese sandwich.

1048
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:20.010
She think what their hair,
I would have got something.
Fuck.

1049
01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:25.800
All right,
so would you like to eat for the rest of you?

1050
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:29.940
I know the sandwich that I can.
This sound like this question came out of cosmo.

1051
01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:33.390
He were to Thanh,
which were kind of thing.
Which would you be,

1052
01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.740
if you could only eat one sandwich for the rest of your life,
what would it be?

1053
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.590
We would never ask each other what kind of sandwich would want to be.

1054
01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.720
We'd be like,
what kind of dress are you?

1055
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:48.110
A classic little black dress cocktail dress or a gown for the Oscars like that.

1056
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:52.380
Well,
what up up for the bigger girls.

1057
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:57.090
What about for the bigger girls when they see the bigger girls or you were car

1058
01:04:57.091 --> 01:04:58.860
cover with Spaghetti straps.
Stock.

1059
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:03.450
I didn't like how they're just feeding your fucking egos.
Like you're all these,

1060
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.210
yeah,
I I get what they're doing.
They're trying to sell magazines

1061
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:11.730
anyway.
What kind of sandwich would you be?
Velveeta.

1062
01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.750
If I was a pair of pants,
I'd be clam diggers.

1063
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.780
I saw like four or five guys wearing those.
Fuck it thinks,

1064
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:26.590
oh this weekend.
Yeah.
Like those guys.

1065
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:29.620
We have the Hitler youth haircuts and then they just walk around with the calves

1066
01:05:29.621 --> 01:05:32.830
up
the fucking airport

1067
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:38.290
since the funniest thing ever.
I don't know why it's not so safe.
Sec.

1068
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:42.190
We'll just point their legs and start laughing.
It's just me.
All right.

1069
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:46.270
I love a good sandwich too.
Okay.
Um,
would I be,

1070
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.870
I don't know.
My freckles and all that.
I'd probably be a lobster roll.

1071
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:55.090
You know.
Got Crab Roll.
No,

1072
01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.640
you're looking at all fucking white with red blotches

1073
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.450
in a day old.
Been,
that'd be my sciatic nerve problem.
I'm a mess.

1074
01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:06.910
It's true.
Like there are certain white people,

1075
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:10.780
they definitely take on the hue of a boiled lobster and when they had to my son

1076
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:13.650
and that would be me.
Um,

1077
01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.640
if you Turkey sandwich cause you like Turkey sandwiches.
Yeah,
but that's not me.

1078
01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.720
You and I know Turkey Sandwich.
You know it's,

1079
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.180
people get excited and happy when Turkey comes around.
You know what I mean?

1080
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.630
You're a Turkey sandwich cause you're like,
what'd you don't ever say that again?

1081
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.190
I think you were Turkey.
This is reliable.
You're satisfied.

1082
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.720
And when I talk I make it go to sleep.
When when consumed,
I make you sleepy.

1083
01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:41.260
All right.
If you could only eat one sandwich,
Nia,
for the rest of your life,

1084
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:43.840
what would it be?
This feels like a lifetime movie.

1085
01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.110
Is a Philly cheese day considered a sandwich?
Cause you know,

1086
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:49.480
that's my all time favorite of all time.

1087
01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:53.930
Well I mean it's not considered breakfast.
No,

1088
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:57.310
it's considered a cereal.
All right.
So yeah,
Philly cheese steak

1089
01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:00.340
here.
We're always a sandwich.
Right?

1090
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:03.860
Or whatever the fuck they call a hero sandwich.
So yeah,

1091
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:06.280
right fucking eat one sandwich.
Rest of my life.

1092
01:07:06.281 --> 01:07:10.700
I'd eat a peanut butter sandwich with butter,
PB and J.
Yeah,

1093
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.950
that's what I would have with a glass of fucking milk weight.

1094
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.510
You'd have jelly on it though.
What do you know?
I don't want to get fat.

1095
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.680
You put Jelly on your fucking with you.
If I could have one once.

1096
01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.660
We'll just one for the rest of my fucking light.

1097
01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:27.190
Why don't have to eat it every day?
No,
not every day,

1098
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:30.520
but the only sandwich when you're in the mood for a sandwich,

1099
01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:32.470
you can only eat this particular sandwich.

1100
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.010
I don't know.
An Italian sub.
You like Italian sandwiches?
Nah.

1101
01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:41.680
Then they put the oil all over and it feels like the breads sweaty.

1102
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.420
You don't always have to get the oil.

1103
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:49.400
I don't know what I'd have.
I don't,
I don't know what I would fucking have it.

1104
01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:52.540
It's just too know I,
I guess if I wouldn't die of a heart attack,

1105
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.790
I'd have a roast beef sandwich.
There you go.
There you go.
Bill.
You're exciting.

1106
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:03.250
All right,
lady likes the belly.
Billy.
You bastard.

1107
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.650
Love the podcast.
It was just funny.
You Bastard,
uh,

1108
01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.990
love the podcast mate.
Um,

1109
01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:13.060
have been following your shenanigans for nearly eight years,

1110
01:08:13.061 --> 01:08:14.980
hustling for tickets when you get here to London.

1111
01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:19.820
I got my birthday on the 3rd of August and we'll be cruising through to your gig

1112
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.983
on the fifth.

1113
01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:25.980
Got You a couple of years ago and gave you a cigar after the show at the round

1114
01:08:25.981 --> 01:08:30.080
house in Camden.
Who knows,
maybe you smoked at course I did.
Okay,

1115
01:08:30.081 --> 01:08:35.060
so help me with this kind of weird dilemma of mine.
Here's the deal.
I'm six,

1116
01:08:35.061 --> 01:08:37.580
two,
six,
three.
On a good day,
if he's feeling good about himself,

1117
01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:40.400
he stands up straight and I'm fairly trim.
However,

1118
01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:44.300
due to my love of cake pie and all things donut I've pack,

1119
01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:49.580
I've packed on a mass in one specific area.
My belly.
Oh God.

1120
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:53.290
That's the classic European fucking body,
you know?
Yeah.

1121
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:57.680
They got those seventh grader arms and then they just got the fucking fish and

1122
01:08:57.681 --> 01:09:00.800
chips belly.
Generally a thinner people,

1123
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:03.670
but they liked their pubs and they're like,
yeah,

1124
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.110
they're thinner because I think their food is higher quality,

1125
01:09:06.111 --> 01:09:09.500
but they just don't go to the gym over there.
They walk around a lot though.

1126
01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:13.280
All right.
My brother loves it.
Um,

1127
01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:17.960
they've nicknamed me big belly Bigsby a callback to Chappelle's,

1128
01:09:17.961 --> 01:09:20.090
Clayton Bigsby and I've become used to,

1129
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.170
used to giving it a good old fashioned slap from time to time.

1130
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.510
My lady loves it too.
She rubs it,

1131
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:31.470
wants to fill up with her rabbit food.
Uh,
she's Vegan,
whatever,
et Cetera,

1132
01:09:31.471 --> 01:09:32.120
et cetera.

1133
01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.770
It's a mind fuck subverts the whole guys got to have a pack vibe.

1134
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.660
You losing me here.
Anyways,

1135
01:09:38.661 --> 01:09:43.661
I'm going to keep on going Michelangelo on this bitch and getting into shape at

1136
01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:48.950
the risk of losing the failsafe laughter of the day.
What do you think?

1137
01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:49.941
Yeah,
dude,

1138
01:09:49.941 --> 01:09:53.570
you don't want to be the fat guy who slaps his belly like a fucking walrus

1139
01:09:53.571 --> 01:09:54.470
looking for a mate.

1140
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.540
<v 9>And if you don't mind data under control,</v>

1141
01:09:56.541 --> 01:09:59.360
it's going to get bigger and bigger and it's going to be bad for your health.

1142
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.990
So trust me,
your girlfriend might love the belly right now,

1143
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:05.000
but she's going to really love that section

1144
01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.810
<v 3>back.
I really,
what if she's insecure?</v>

1145
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:11.260
She's worried that he's going to go out and fucking start doing the full Monte

1146
01:10:11.261 --> 01:10:12.050
someplace,

1147
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:13.880
<v 9>both work.
And get the six pack together.</v>

1148
01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:17.960
Although she might already have it since she's a Vegan and it never happens.

1149
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:22.250
And to keep what couples could never work out.
I don't like,
yeah,

1150
01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:27.140
I'm not into it.
But remember we tried to work out and I was just yelling.

1151
01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:30.950
You push it.
I don't want,
no,

1152
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:34.090
we never worked out together like that.
We will go to the gym together,

1153
01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.820
her thing and I would do,
we always do.
We go to a party.
What did we do?

1154
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.600
We go in different separate words.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I came here to have a good time.

1155
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:46.260
Not to be,
got to be with the person I live with.
I came here.
Yeah.

1156
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.990
I live with Deanna.
I don't need to hang out with you at this point.

1157
01:10:48.991 --> 01:10:53.690
So what's going on with you in this new environment?
All right.

1158
01:10:53.691 --> 01:10:56.100
I get to know your girlfriend's going to love the six bag,

1159
01:10:56.101 --> 01:11:00.050
so keep at it and like to keep a belly just so people can slap it around.

1160
01:11:00.051 --> 01:11:03.260
So you can be that guy at the party after a while.
Yeah,
that's pathetic.

1161
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:08.120
It's better to get shredded and be,
you know,
real Michael Lynch.

1162
01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:12.910
<v 3>Hello.
Yeah.
Then you get to walk around being a Dick,
being aloof,</v>

1163
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.830
you know,
you just,
every time people talk to you,

1164
01:11:14.831 --> 01:11:17.540
you pretend you're looking at something down the street with the fucking

1165
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:21.390
eyebrows up.
Sorry man.
It's got to keep on moving.
You know,

1166
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:23.140
I'm like a shark.

1167
01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:28.960
Can you talk about that poster a yeah,
no,

1168
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.090
I missed that.
Yeah.
The guy that she brought up a bunch of great points,
which is,

1169
01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:38.340
well I don't know if you want to go back and read it.
Um,
I can't,

1170
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:42.510
I don't remember.
He was just saying like,
well no,
15 was like,
whoa,

1171
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:45.570
here's one that I made it.
If he was holding up Hugh Jackman,

1172
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.470
would that increase the chances of guys fighting other guys?

1173
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:55.380
I don't think it's about like increasing,
like influencing people to do it.

1174
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:59.190
It's just like,
it's just not,
well,
they said it,
it isn't a great look.
I actually,

1175
01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:00.600
I don't think it's a good poster,

1176
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:04.920
but I would say that I don't think it promotes violence against women.

1177
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:07.200
I wouldn't think so.
We are there,

1178
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:11.700
but although I'm not trying to speak for blue women though.
That's right.
Uh,

1179
01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:13.530
they can speak for themselves.
No,
I don't know.

1180
01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.480
I saw that poster and I first of all couldn't tell it was a woman,

1181
01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:22.500
but if I was like well versed in that whole thing,
I would be like,
oh,

1182
01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:26.670
that's such and such character.
Uh,
yeah,
I don't,
I don't know.

1183
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.240
But I think it's probably best that they,
they're all in the,

1184
01:12:30.241 --> 01:12:31.920
all the different poster I was saying.

1185
01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:36.090
They're all named after like discontinued colognes and I'm like,

1186
01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:40.710
what mystique apocalypse.
Just sounds like.

1187
01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.730
It's like whoever came up with Zima then tried to get into Cologne and it all

1188
01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:47.400
fucking bombed.
Right.
Listen,

1189
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.780
I'm fortunately got to stop the podcast cause I gotta go to work.
Boom.

1190
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:55.640
Bump off the to to,
to,
to do loo do.
All right.

1191
01:12:55.650 --> 01:13:00.370
Thank you guys for listening and um,
I'll let you guys know about those Presales,

1192
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:04.980
um,
for the upcoming dates in Ireland and a thank you to everybody that's been

1193
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.840
buying tickets in Scotland,

1194
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:12.130
in Amsterdam and London and a second show in London,
Nini.
That's so great.
Yeah.

1195
01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.830
When I phoned us,
the Gabba where I can fucking smoke a stick after.
I love that.

1196
01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:21.020
Nice big picture of fucking,
I don't know,
Winston Churchill Isam.

1197
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.220
Shit would be wonderful,
right?

1198
01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:30.420
We gotta fight under here.
Is that Winston Churchill?
It's already made.

1199
01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:34.290
All right.
Winston Churchill in front.
I think ace is high.
I believe it was.

1200
01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.040
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'll check in on your Thursday.
