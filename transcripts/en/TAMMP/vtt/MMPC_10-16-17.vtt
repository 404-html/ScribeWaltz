00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.190
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for money.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.000
<v 2>Yay.</v>

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.290
<v 1>October 16th,</v>

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.120
2017 what's going on?
How are Ya?
Oh,

6
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.900
freckles is in a good mood.
He is in a great mood.
What a,

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.930
what a fucking great win.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.780
Gutting great wind by the New England patriots.

9
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:30.320
Noncontroversial nothing to complain about.

10
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.330
I don't understand what the Jessica,
it was clearly,
hey,

11
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:39.500
did the guy look like a,

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:43.580
you ever see when like people join the mafia and they got to hold that little

13
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:47.330
candle like he was doing that for one hand to another.
Clearly not a catch.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.690
I mean,
oh,
he caught it and then it was a fumble.
I'm fucking with the green cons.

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.100
I don't get it either.
That looked like a touchdown to me.

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.180
And you know what sucks.

17
00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.470
I wish that days called it a touchdown because then it would have been tied up

18
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.010
and I could've watched Tom Brady go right down the field and break your fucking

19
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:07.190
green hearts once again,
the fucking nerve.

20
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:10.770
You jet fans to act like you got fucked out of a victory.
What you got fucked.

21
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.210
What do you know what you've got the NFL,
the refs gave you mercy,

22
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.950
they gave you some mercy.
Let's just put them out of their fucking misery.

23
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.340
Come on man.
The guy,
how many you fucking fair with the best.

24
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:25.310
It's because of that call.

25
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.970
We'll able to go down there and get to your fucking green and White High Yon
Day.

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.710
Whatever the fuck it is you're driving.
Right.

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.390
<v 1>And left the stadium early because of that wonderful accurate call.</v>

29
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.870
Um,
I'm fucking with you guys.
I'm just being a Douche.
I don't,

30
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.380
I don't get it either.
I don't,
I,

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.050
I wish I was at call.
I wish it was called the touchdown.

32
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.770
They don't want to be tied up.
Would have been exciting game music siting gay,

33
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:52.370
but you know,
add to the drama tie score.

34
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.380
Who's going to win the jets and the Patriots have used as a fucking blow up doll

35
00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:59.310
for the last 15 years.

36
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.760
This sick of this sick of loosen to the little sick of losing to these New

37
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.770
England patriots,
these patriots of the Lakeland.
Um,

38
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.310
this is what I love.
You know,

39
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.130
what was my favorite part of that game was when the jet scored the first

40
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.310
touchdown to go up seven to nothing.
If you can look at the highlight,

41
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.120
look in the crowd,
that dude,
the jet fan with the,
he's got the Jersey on,

42
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:22.260
he's holding his smartphone and he's given double fingers at like one of the New

43
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.990
England patriots,
a defensive badge.
Like fuck,

44
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.540
I got admit as a sports fan,

45
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.720
I know what that feeling is like,
you know,

46
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.860
I haven't known it for a good 15 years,
16,
17 years.
But I,
I,
I,
you know,

47
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:40.410
the first 32 years of my life,

48
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.140
34 years old,
you know,
depending on the sport was,
that's what it was.

49
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.570
We just did not win that.
I,

50
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.630
I saw myself back when the Patriots would always lose to the dolphins,

51
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.890
Dan Marino.
Like we'd,
we'd finally sack them,
somehow,

52
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:01.140
finally sack him and he'd be on the ground and be like,
fuck you.
Oh look,

53
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.830
we finally got him.
So,
um,
I took that as a,

54
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.750
uh,
a not of respect to the patriots as much as the plus the guy,

55
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.540
he's a real fan man,
if he's,
if he gives a shit that much.
Um,

56
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.190
so anyways,
I,
uh,
I'm out here.
I am,
uh,

57
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.420
I am manic right now because I am in a mild depression.

58
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.770
I miss my family so much and would try to get him to fly out here this week.

59
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:30.310
It's just fucking ridiculous.
Um,

60
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.870
I gotta I gotta see my kid one way or another.
I got to see my kids.
So,
um,

61
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.730
I just been,
I just been fucking watching sports,
everybody,

62
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.790
that's all I've been doing.
I mean,
I know I always do it,
but like,

63
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.260
I literally was like,
what am I going to do on Saturday?
You know,

64
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.570
they don't shoot on weekends.
What am I going to do out here?

65
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.670
I don't know what the fuck to do with myself.

66
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:51.670
So I drove three hours up in three hours back.

67
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:55.390
I went to that Tennessee volunteer game against the,
um,

68
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.400
<v 3>that South Carolina Gamecocks MSC.</v>

69
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.450
She acts and it ain't going to be swapping jump paint.

70
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.940
I went up there and it was,

71
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.690
<v 1>it was fucking awesome.
It was a great drive.
Um,
you know,</v>

72
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.860
if you're a comedian you got to love driving after a while and he also got to

73
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:16.620
love driving by yourself.
You know,
if you're,
uh,

74
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.170
if you're a comedian you don't like doing that,

75
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:22.310
you usually end up getting an acting career or writing career or are you just

76
00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:24.890
fucking quit the business?
I don't know what it is,
but I've always enjoyed it.

77
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.110
So I had a great time driving up there.

78
00:04:27.111 --> 00:04:31.010
I never drove from Atlanta and the Chattanooga up to fucking Knoxville.

79
00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:33.650
I want to see what it looks like.
Um,

80
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.410
and I was driving up there,
it was a 12 noon game,

81
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:41.090
so I didn't leave it like fucking quarter to eight in the morning.
Um,

82
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.490
but this is good cause it can go all the way up there and it can be three hours

83
00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:45.020
for the game and three hours to drive back.

84
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.020
By the time I get back I can still do a spot down the street at the club.

85
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.250
Ian Edwards is going to be down there.

86
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:57.150
One of the best fucking comedians in the country that nobody,
none.

87
00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:01.160
Not Enough people know about.
All right.
Like I looked up the other day,

88
00:05:01.161 --> 00:05:02.630
I looked up this guitar,
this,

89
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.220
I found this guitarist that was for the wow was known as the greatest guitarist.

90
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:10.550
Nobody ever heard of like Danny,
uh,
gotten or something like that.

91
00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:15.200
I got to get his fucking name right.
The guy's unbelievable.
He's,
I mean,

92
00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:19.010
unfortunately he's dead,
but uh,
you know,

93
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.440
<v 3>guy was,
she was like a fucking do you got Danny Gatton,
g A.
T.
T.
O.
N.</v>

94
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.420
Look that guy up and there's a plane thing when he plays Austin city limits

95
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:31.930
where I'm going to be next week.
I'm at the new one,
not the one he was at.

96
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:35.230
They say he plays a song where they say with a beer can,

97
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.900
he actually does it with a beer bottle.
I've seen people do at the slide and

98
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.170
<v 1>all that.
But um,</v>

99
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.970
watch what happens because the beer gets all over it like starts,
you know,

100
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.150
there's beer in there,
so it starts fizzing up.

101
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.010
It gets all over his fret board and then he puts a towel over the fret board to

102
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:56.400
dry it off while continuing to play.
Um,

103
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.010
I've seen,
I mean,
I've seen a

104
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 3>lot of tricks.
Uh,
it,
it was fucking amazing.</v>

105
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:04.870
So I'm Ian Edwards,
I'm telling you,
you gotta see,

106
00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:06.560
you gotta see that guy that it's just,

107
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.860
there's something wrong with our fucking business that more people does that

108
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.290
don't know who that guy is.
So I was like,

109
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.110
I got to go down and go see him do a set.
And plus not only that,

110
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.120
that'll take up my whole fucking Saturday,

111
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.610
then I'll stay out late enough to come home,
fall asleep,
boom.
Done.
Right.

112
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.940
So anyways,
so I'm driving,

113
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:28.610
I'm driving up to northern fucking Georgia into certain tenets to say,
and his,

114
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:33.320
all this fucking traffic.
So the robot lady and my phone starts talking to me,

115
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:36.750
creeping me out,
telling me there's a quicker way.
It's just like,
why?

116
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.430
How do you have time to pay attention to me?
Who are you?
But thank you.

117
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.420
So I get off the fucking road and I'm driving up north there and uh,

118
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.750
I went by this fucking house,
you know those houses where they,

119
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:53.510
somebody just has like 20 old cars sit in the front yard.

120
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.410
This fucking lunatic had like 30 not cars.

121
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.610
He had riding mowers.
Now like the landscape level ones,

122
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:05.930
like the ones like your dad had,
you know,
and you try to fucking,
you know,

123
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:08.030
steal the keys to take it out or whatever.

124
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.360
You'd run over a friend of yours and he'd lose a foot or whatever,
you know,

125
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:15.290
that type of shit.
Jesus,
what's going on out here?
Oh,
Christ,

126
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.770
the gay pride parade.
Still going on.

127
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.010
Is there anything on Flyer?
Um,

128
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.450
they had the gay pride parade out here,
went right by the hotel yesterday and uh,

129
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.870
you know,
it's fucking funny.
There's always one guy who has to just ruin it,

130
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.333
you know what I mean?

131
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.120
There's always one guy that just ruins it for everybody else.
Like,
you know,

132
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:39.350
sports fans of cool.

133
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500
And then just one douchebag at a panthers game has to turn around and blast a 63

134
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.840
year old guy in the face.
Not once,
not twice,

135
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.270
not three times a lady,

136
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:54.690
four fucking times least.
They caught the guy.
Dude,
that guy is looking,

137
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.420
I think at some serious jail time.
Serious fucking jail time.
Uh,

138
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.440
you know,
the first two maybe get some fucking,
you know,
Andy Griffith,

139
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.770
lower Gamal,
you know,
emotions were running hand and that guy,

140
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:10.970
he shared a loud names,
calling him,
going back and forth.
You know,

141
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.540
we just got a little bit,
hold on it.
Kevin was right.
Maybe he could see,

142
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.590
I don't know what,
just get him a couple like a month in jail or something.

143
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:22.760
It's the fact that they broke it up and he came back for those last two brutal

144
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:23.594
ones.

145
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.910
Jesus Christ and I hope old people learn something out there.
Okay.

146
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.040
You didn't know as much as it hurts your lower back.

147
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:35.240
You got to keep that head moving.
Can't,
you can't just be a stationary target.

148
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.880
Um,
he's God damn old people.
You know,

149
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.230
it's like they,
you,
if you want to talk shit,
you gotta move your fucking head.

150
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.570
Um,
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
this fucking guy,

151
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:54.320
he had like 30 riding lawnmowers sitting in his front yard.

152
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.220
I was doing like miles an hour and I drove

153
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.890
<v 1>past it and it wasn't going to stop because I was worried it wasn't going to get</v>

154
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.320
to the game and time and it was fucking hilarious.

155
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:05.270
The ironic part was like the grass had all grown up around them,
like the,

156
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.600
these front yard needed to be mowed,
but he couldn't mow it because he had said,

157
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.970
you know,
we had all the fucking tractors.
You get it people,

158
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.160
there's something that,
there's a joke in there somewhere.

159
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.060
I just don't know where.

160
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.673
<v 4>MMM.</v>

161
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.570
<v 1>Anyways,
I,
uh,
ended up getting updated to the stadium,</v>

162
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.280
the Tennessee game place I always wanted to go to.
Um,
and it was,

163
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.560
it was fucking awesome.
And not only that,
as a freckled borderline albino con,

164
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.230
I picked the perfect row.
I called up stubhub and I told him,
I said,

165
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.210
I'm an old man who gets sunburned.

166
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.410
I want to be in the lower deck right above the roof of the Oh,
you know,

167
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.240
of the upper deck and the lady's like,
okay,

168
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:46.350
well he thinking he actually for once I looked at the,
the,
uh,

169
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.000
the stadium map,
you know,
and

170
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.790
<v 4>okay.</v>

171
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:56.170
<v 1>You know,
so when they say,
Hey,
I know you don't give a fuck,
you just,</v>

172
00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:59.700
you just sold a ticket to,
to a fucking World Cup game.
Now I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
and I,

173
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.140
I brought you into Tennessee.
You don't,
you don't even know where you're at.

174
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.030
So I went with row 57 and it was the perfect row.

175
00:10:07.031 --> 00:10:11.050
It was the last fucking role that the sun didn't touch cause I was on the

176
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:13.300
visitors side.
If you ever go to the stadium,

177
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:18.310
the sun creeps up the visitor's side,
it goes down on the home side.

178
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.510
So it creeped all the way up to [inaudible] 56 and at the end of the game it
was,

179
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:27.460
it was on like from like mid calf down.
I fuck it.
I nailed it.
I mean,

180
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.540
actually if I did 58,
it would have been perfect.
But,
um,
it was just,

181
00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:34.210
it was an awesome time.
One of the biggest stadiums.

182
00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:37.300
I believe it's the fifth largest stadium as far as the amount of people that it

183
00:10:37.301 --> 00:10:40.540
holds.
And it's an old school stadium.
Fuck,

184
00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:42.310
I didn't even have the nerve to go in the bathroom.

185
00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:46.300
I just saw this door that looked like a fucking closet door and I was like,

186
00:10:46.301 --> 00:10:47.890
there's a bathroom in there.
There's no way.

187
00:10:47.891 --> 00:10:51.850
There's not pissed troughs in there and I am not peeing in a fucking piss
trough.

188
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.310
I'm not doing it.
And,
um,

189
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.060
I gotta tell you when you're on the lower level and you're walking through that

190
00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:02.380
you feel like you're in a bunker.
If your cluster phobic,
I wouldn't do it.
Um,

191
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.410
I got all these great pictures.
I got a post a man.
They just like,

192
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.880
the stadium is so fucking cool and I have to go there.

193
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.690
You know,
they have a decent team.
I want to go there when,
uh,

194
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.830
to an sec game at night under the lights when it fucking matters.

195
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:23.230
Um,
underrated city,
Knoxville,
underrated,
Chattanooga,
Tennessee.
He's the shit.

196
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.720
Um,
you go to Nashville.
Nashville is like Austin,
Texas where it,

197
00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:28.510
it's just everybody's moving.
All right.
Atlanta,

198
00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:32.910
everybody's just that just fucking overcrowded.
And,
um,
the two great cities.

199
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:37.870
So I went there,
you know,
the fucking bands playing,
you know,

200
00:11:37.871 --> 00:11:41.140
there wasn't a bunch of scream and yell and they didn't have giant flat screen

201
00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:44.470
fucking TVs and explosions and shit.
It was just,

202
00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:46.510
it was like the old school just go into a game.

203
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.710
There was a hilarious guy in my section,
which there always is.

204
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.140
You just can't hear him.
Now when you go to a game,

205
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.620
there was this fucking big fat dude,
Dude.

206
00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:59.410
There was a lot of fatties at the gay tennis.
See what's going on up there.

207
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.540
Lay off the fucking barbecue.
Jesus Christ.
I could tell why you guys love those.

208
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:08.890
Fucking checkered overalls holds you a fucking beer belly really nicely.

209
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.410
Um,
this guy was fucking hilarious.

210
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.780
He looked like he was dressed like herb Tarlek.
Um,

211
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.580
except what was all Tennessee gear and he was so fucking amped up for the game

212
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:21.670
and he was getting this section going and he would always get right up to the

213
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:24.460
border line.
It says this guy fucking nuts.
And then he'd look at him,

214
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:27.370
you'd have this shit eating grin on his face,
like laughing at himself,

215
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.360
knowing that he was nuts,
that he was getting this amped up for the game.
But,
um,

216
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.390
it was a great game and I stayed till the end,

217
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:38.830
like my mother taught me and it came right down to the last play.
I fucking,

218
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:42.700
you know,
I video taped it while I looked over so I could watch it,
you know,

219
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.550
live and not look at it.
So my screen.

220
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.680
<v 4>MMM.</v>

221
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.260
<v 1>And it looks like the guy had a chance.</v>

222
00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:49.560
It wouldn't let it look like it went right to his.

223
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:50.570
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

224
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.750
<v 1>Is that his fingers and it didn't work,
whatever.
And then I drove fucking back.</v>

225
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.010
I came down here,

226
00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:59.840
I went down to the laughing skull and I got to watch the Great Ian Edwards just

227
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:01.700
fucking blew me away.
I'm telling you right now,

228
00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:03.890
if you get a chance to see that guy live,
you got to do it.

229
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.580
You got to do it before it blows up.
Uh,
hung out with him.

230
00:13:07.581 --> 00:13:11.540
Some of his friends got a grilled cheese sandwiches,
some French fries.

231
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:16.190
Late night out.
Jesus just eating like a fat chick on Prom night.

232
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.673
<v 4>MMM.</v>

233
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:23.130
<v 1>I'm depressed or right fucking dealing with this shit.
Um,</v>

234
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.430
so anyways,
so that was that day.
So then Sunday comes along.
I'm like,
well,

235
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:31.690
how am I going to kill this day?
A loneliness.
And it's like,
oh shit.

236
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:35.240
The Atlanta Falcons are home.
They got a fucking home game.

237
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.760
<v 5>Shit.
They playing the dolphins.
Fucking Jay Cutler.</v>

238
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.960
I'm going to go see,
I've already saw them play against a,
the rams,

239
00:13:42.961 --> 00:13:45.700
this sheet to charge us this.
Yeah.
I'll go down and go check checkup.

240
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.430
And evidently the,
uh,

241
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.990
the fucking falcons have this new dome stadium that's going to be unbelievable.

242
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:54.790
So I was that guy,
and I'll go to this fucking game.

243
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:57.850
Last time I was here was in fucking 2000 and

244
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.600
I saw uh,

245
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.460
Michael Vick back when he was drowned in the dogs and nobody knew the most

246
00:14:06.461 --> 00:14:09.520
electrifying fucking football player I ever saw.

247
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.530
Every time you went out of the pocket,

248
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.490
the whole stadium stood up like it was the last play of the championship game

249
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:16.630
and a Hail Mary was coming.
Yeah.

250
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.473
<v 4>MMM.</v>

251
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.420
<v 5>Place would go crazy.
Right?
So I'm a guy,
I'm going to go over the,</v>

252
00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:23.690
I don't have a ticket.
I'll be all right.
I'm just,
I'll scout the ticket.

253
00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:26.240
I'll sit at the top of the stadium.
Who gives a fuck?

254
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.850
So I get over there and there's like no scalpers and I'm like,
what the fuck?

255
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.590
Oh No,
no.
I didn't.
The Gay Pride Parade.
I walked through the gay pride parade.

256
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.760
I got to get back to the one guy who ruins it.
So it's typical gay pride parade.

257
00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:40.340
Bunch people,
fucking rainbows on the faces.
You know,

258
00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:43.040
a couple guys walking around in high heels,
shoes,
gay pride parade.

259
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.120
Everybody's having a good time.
What's not the fucking like,
right?

260
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:52.190
There's always the one dude who has to ruin it.
This jerk off

261
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.650
<v 1>is standing there on the side of the road.</v>

262
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.390
He has like a fucking giant Dick and balls like balloon animal.

263
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.100
That was his like three quarters to sides of his body.
This giant pink,

264
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.180
a wrecked fucking Dick with balls and it's just like,
dude,

265
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.680
this kid's here,
this fuck.
What is wrong with you?

266
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.410
This is what blows my mind is you're,

267
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:17.510
you're able to do that at the gay pride parade.

268
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.650
I'm trying to think of a parade that I could go to with a giant inflated vagina

269
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.330
with kids around and it's just in public.
I just don't think he could do it.

270
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.350
But anyways,
hey,

271
00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.730
I'm trying to be progressive.

272
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:37.090
God bless this guy with this giant Dick and balls like fucking twisted up

273
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:38.151
balloon in them.

274
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:42.350
I actually had to wonder if that was like a plant from the religious right to

275
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:44.620
show all gay people represent them as like the,

276
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.780
there's just see sexually deviant fucking people,
you know,

277
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:50.360
like he always say those conspiracy theories that they have,
you know,

278
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.280
whenever there's a peaceful demonstration,

279
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:54.860
they sent somebody down there to throw a rock through a window just to get

280
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:57.260
everybody going to start writing.
So they,
you know,

281
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.090
all the people protesting get to be lumped in with that one douche.
Um,

282
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.781
so whatever.

283
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:06.590
So I totally judged this guy with this giant fucking balloon twisted Dick and

284
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.380
balls going,
what are fucking,
what the fuck is wrong?
Well,

285
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:13.580
how the fuck was this guy raised?
Blahblahblahblahblah smash cut to me.

286
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.760
Not even 20 minutes later when I find this no scalpers and I go up to the

287
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:22.790
fucking Wilco,
one of the ticket windows,
they say they're sold out.

288
00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:27.791
And the only way to get a ticket as they have to go on my phone to ticket master

289
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.590
and I,
I have no idea how to do this.
I've avoided computers.
I don't know.

290
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.200
I don't,
I just,
I'm bad with the Shit,
you know what I mean?
You know,
like,

291
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.900
like me trying to figure out this shit is like to ask somebody like somebody

292
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:46.670
tone deaf to sing a fucking song,
you know,

293
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.830
it's just you can't do it right.
So,
uh,

294
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.350
could you tell I got a text message in the middle of that I didn't even finish

295
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:55.940
off whatever funny thought I was trying to have.

296
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:59.000
They're mildly amusing thought I was trying to have.
So anyways,

297
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.510
I fucking get over the stadium and now I've got to figure out this tick ticket

298
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:02.951
mass of things.

299
00:17:02.951 --> 00:17:07.920
So I walk away like it just like cursing my fucking brains out fucking goddamn

300
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.470
fucking cock sucking buck Rogers fucking cunty bullshit walking by kids and
shit.

301
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:14.900
And I see parents looking at me like,
dude,
what the fuck?

302
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.900
And in the way in the back of my head is that voice of reason,
hey bill,

303
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.950
there's no reason to get this.
They get this crazy.
Come on really.

304
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.260
Then there's children here and I just did the fucking demon in me,

305
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:29.900
just like a mother fucking country.

306
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.620
So I sit down like a little fucking boy,

307
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.460
like a little like the little fucking baby than I am Jesus Christ built,

308
00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:39.260
download the fucking APP and figure it out.

309
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.070
Trying to figure out it's not working.
I'm,
I'm just,
every time it wouldn't work,

310
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:44.120
I'm like,
dude,
what the fuck?

311
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:47.900
I would literally yell that loud people walking by looking like,

312
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.470
what the fuck is wrong with that?
Right.

313
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.220
<v 5>And finally,
uh,</v>

314
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.620
some 20 something security kid came walking by with his yellow coat.

315
00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:57.900
I was just like,
dude,
I'm an old bastard.
I don't know how to do this.

316
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.930
Can you help me out with this?
And he was just like,
yeah,
just click on this.

317
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.160
Click on this.
Click on that again.
All right,
there it is.
There's a ticket.

318
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.500
And I'm just sitting there and look at it.
See,
I'm like,
this is a ticket.

319
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:10.890
He's like,
yeah,
it's a ticket.
I go,
what do I do?
And he just laughed and he goes,

320
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:14.190
just bring your phone.
And then they scan it.
I'm like,
this is going to work.

321
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:16.800
And he's like,
yeah.
So now I'm

322
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.960
<v 1>standing in line.
I have so little faith that technology is,
is gonna.</v>

323
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.351
It's gonna work for me.

324
00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:26.740
All I could think of was midnight express in the beginning of the movie when the

325
00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:28.990
dude is the drugs tape to them and like,
I'm going to get,

326
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.350
this isn't going to work.
They're going to,
they're going to get like,

327
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.590
they're going to toss me out of the fucking stadium and I'm going to be out this

328
00:18:35.591 --> 00:18:39.460
whatever,
a hundred bucks or whatever.
I paid for this ticket and I went up,
I,

329
00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:44.170
they scanned it and it worked and I was like,
wow,
I have to fuck it worked.

330
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.340
Then I was just like,
well,
what's what of,
how do I add this to my,

331
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:53.170
all my stack of tickets?
Do I got to fucking put my phone in there now?

332
00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.410
Do I take a picture of it and then print it out on my printer and then that's

333
00:19:00.411 --> 00:19:02.510
the ticket.
I don't get it.

334
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.630
<v 5>So anyways,
I go into this stadium and Jesus Christ,
I'm telling you,</v>

335
00:19:07.631 --> 00:19:11.440
you got to fucking go to the stadium.
This is the best NFL stadium out there.

336
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.590
It is like,
I mean,
my,

337
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.760
my top of the new ones before that,
I mean,

338
00:19:18.761 --> 00:19:22.510
you gotta go cowboys stadium even though that TV is just so fucking big and

339
00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:26.320
obnoxious.
It's actually stu,
if they took the TV out of there,
the cowboys,

340
00:19:26.321 --> 00:19:29.320
I think they would like,
you know what I mean?

341
00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.570
The cowboys stadium is like,
I dunno,

342
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.400
you ever see like a beautiful woman that's just absolutely shit faced and she's

343
00:19:36.401 --> 00:19:40.360
got like fucking lipstick on her teeth and red wine breath and you're just like,

344
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.000
oh my God,
she's getting,
you know,
and she's a 10,

345
00:19:43.001 --> 00:19:46.180
but you like get the fuck away from me.
Right.
That's what the cowboy state,

346
00:19:46.181 --> 00:19:47.410
that's what that TV is,

347
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:52.070
just fucks up the whole stadium and the Seahawks have a great stadium.
Um,

348
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.170
even though they're cheating,

349
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.100
<v 1>making their crowd sound louder than it is.
But anyways,
um,</v>

350
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.710
speaking of cheaters to fucking Atlanta Falcons who got caught popping a crowd

351
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:05.190
noise since,
so I'm at the,
this cheaters,
right?
Um,

352
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.960
I made the stadium,
dude,
it's fucking breathtaking.

353
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.310
It's one of the cleanest design.
Sickest fucking unblock.

354
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.230
Jerry Jones is going to be upset if he,

355
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.200
I'm sure you see God on his private plane.

356
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.870
You don't get botox injections on the way over there.

357
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:25.890
I'm sure when he walked in though,
these God damn motherfuckers,
right?
He's God.

358
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.070
Damn.
Motherfuckers think probably fucking,
I don't know.

359
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.250
God helped the woman that he's banging that weekend.
Jerry,

360
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:35.520
I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong now.
Shut the fuck up,
bitch.

361
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.410
<v 4>That's okay.</v>

362
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.040
<v 5>It's taken out everything on her.
Dude.
That stadium is fucking,</v>

363
00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:48.040
I felt like I was in a spaceship.
It was fucking awesome.
I'm like,
you know,
it was

364
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.250
<v 1>quite,
I'm missing my family.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm down there.
I'm just like,
oh good,
good.</v>

365
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.060
Now I'm in a good mood and do an I am sitting at the top of the stadium and it's

366
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:56.230
still fucking awesome.
I know.

367
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.740
It was so fucking high up when the place what happened and he could kind of just

368
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:03.820
just watched the whole defense.
You know?
I love doing that.
When you go to a game,

369
00:21:03.821 --> 00:21:06.400
when you sit up high,
just watching the defense,

370
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:10.240
he kind of have like in your peripheral where the ball's going and just trying

371
00:21:10.241 --> 00:21:10.990
to see it.
All the linemen,

372
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.870
if they come down and try to like pick up a linebacker or something like that or

373
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:14.080
like,

374
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.913
<v 4>Gotcha.</v>

375
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.560
<v 1>You know,
try to figure out which receivers open.
I'm a nerd.</v>

376
00:21:18.561 --> 00:21:21.330
I love doing that shit.
However,
I got to tell you something,
man.

377
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.540
<v 4>Okay.</v>

378
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.290
<v 1>The experience of going to that game,
I get that the NFL cares,</v>

379
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:27.970
but Jesus Christ,

380
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.480
I think the NFL has kind of forgot that sports is like an escape.

381
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.070
<v 4>Okay.</v>

382
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.350
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Especially now with social media and all that shit.</v>

383
00:21:37.351 --> 00:21:39.300
You just can't get away with all the fucking,

384
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.443
<v 4>uh,</v>

385
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.570
<v 1>just all the fucking shit that's going,
my God,
this,</v>

386
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:45.870
this city just got hit by a fucking hurricane this way.

387
00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:48.150
And when we got to Puerto Rico,
then,
well,
why?
Why is it,

388
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.830
why aren't they getting help out there?
You know what I mean?

389
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.890
All these veterans that come back to commit suicide,
blah,
blah,
blah,

390
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:57.730
all this fucking shit.
It's just,
it's fucking brutal.
So what do you do?

391
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.160
You need to shut it off for a while.
You go to a fucking game.

392
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:03.070
But this was the experience at the Atlanta game.
First of all,
dude,

393
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.630
it was so fucking loud in there.
And to just take all this with a grain of salt,

394
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:11.140
because I'm a,
I'm an old cut.
All right.
I get in.

395
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:13.480
It was so fucking

396
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.020
<v 4>loud.
Um,</v>

397
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.440
<v 1>they have these giant flat screens up at the top.</v>

398
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.930
I'll go around in a circle and they were amazing.

399
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.750
I don't think that they're too big and they're not hanging down in your face,

400
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:26.850
so they're not really that distracting or anything.

401
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:32.130
But it was like the cheerleaders came out and they fucking with playing this

402
00:22:32.131 --> 00:22:35.850
music,
I felt like I was at an ACDC concert.
It was that fucking loud.

403
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:37.853
<v 4>And</v>

404
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.220
<v 1>all of a sudden,
like Sam Jackson,
no,
no,
no.
Wait before that weight,</v>

405
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.230
before that little John and another,
uh,
Atlanta rapper,
I don't,
I mean,

406
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.310
I'm white.
You Shit.
I don't know who the fuck this guy is.
Um,
I'm sure he's great.

407
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.990
Whatever.
They did like a public service announcement on fan behavior.

408
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.050
All right.

409
00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:01.360
Which I'm sure is based off the one comment who fucking punched the 62 year old

410
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:04.900
guy four times in the face and now we got to get a lecture on how to be human

411
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:09.700
beings and they just sit there,
go like,
ah,
you know,
don't,
uh,
don't,
you know,

412
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:14.270
don't be discourteous to the people next to you.
It was fun.

413
00:23:14.271 --> 00:23:17.000
It was really bland copy and watching the little John trying to like add

414
00:23:17.001 --> 00:23:20.420
something to it was hilarious.
Uh,

415
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:21.510
<v 4>yeah.</v>

416
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.410
<v 1>And He,
at one point they say,
don't say anything racial.</v>

417
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.450
I believe that's what they were saying.
It was so loud.

418
00:23:27.451 --> 00:23:28.860
It was echoing and I couldn't hear it.

419
00:23:28.861 --> 00:23:31.980
And then there was something about not seeing anything politically charged.

420
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.760
Now it's just like,
where the fuck am I right now?
Who the fuck gives above?

421
00:23:38.761 --> 00:23:43.230
Gives a shit about politics?
I'm at a football game.
Who gives a fuck?

422
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.130
I'm trying to think back

423
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.760
<v 0>when I was a kid,
when I went to a Bruins patriots game or something like that,</v>

424
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.420
you know,
in the late eighties.
I don't ever remember anybody yell it out.

425
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:57.140
Shit about Mike Dukakis versus George Bush Sr.

426
00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.413
MMM.

427
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.740
<v 1>Anyways,
I'll let me get back to this guy real quick.</v>

428
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.950
Um,
yeah,
so they sent to the,

429
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.890
there's this whole fucking thing happens and then the fucking cheerleaders come

430
00:24:11.891 --> 00:24:16.830
out and they're playing some fucking crazy loud saw ag ag,
ag ag.
Well,

431
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.310
I'll be happy bleed fucking Dj Shit.
They're out there dancing,

432
00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:25.090
shaking their ass.
I literally had my fingers in my ears like Jesus Christ,

433
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.360
I should have brought earplugs to this fucking thing.
And then out of nowhere,

434
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.450
Sam Jackson starts fucking screaming at everybody to get up something about the

435
00:24:33.791 --> 00:24:38.430
heartbeat.
You know,
we got a fucking this,
first of all,
it's like Sam Jackson,

436
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.620
you're from New York.
When did you start giving a shit about the falcons?

437
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.100
You know what I mean?
I mean,

438
00:24:45.101 --> 00:24:48.370
you would think he had enough capital one money to take a fucking weekend.

439
00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:49.720
All the guys in Star Wars.

440
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.170
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

441
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.320
<v 1>he is like capital one.
He's everywhere.
You want to be right.</v>

442
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.620
It's fucking guy's screaming and he's doing the whole fucking like it was

443
00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:01.030
something about a heartbeat.
He yelled some shit,
we gotta fucking got out.

444
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.360
And then this giant heart people go,
go,
God definitely.

445
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.060
And then they'd cut to like,
you know,
and when it,
when it was like beating,

446
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:09.910
they would cut to like an a Atlanta Falcon,

447
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:14.570
like thumping his chest mean mugging you.
And I'm just like,
dude,

448
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:15.404
I'm not playing.

449
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.330
I don't need to get this amped up screaming and fucking yelling.

450
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:25.460
That was so loud and so fucking distracting that I didn't even notice that the

451
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:27.260
fucking players had taken the field.

452
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.970
And what alerted me that the players had taken the field was after capital one,

453
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:35.900
Sam Jackson had stopped screaming and the heartbeat,
it ended,

454
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.590
all of a sudden I hear a locomotive train horn.

455
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.790
He just goes wow.
Loud as shit.

456
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.230
And they kicked the ball off.
So it was the cheerleaders Dank,

457
00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.220
dank at good Sam Jackson.
Get the fuck up you motherfuckers,
you know.
And then,

458
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.100
and after all of that shit,

459
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.930
the fucking ball just goes out to the back of the end zone and then they

460
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:02.270
announced it just goes touch back in Atlanta.

461
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:13.310
<v 5>So I burst out laughing and the lady next to me starts laughing and I look at</v>

462
00:26:13.411 --> 00:26:17.760
her like she saw what I saw and thought it was funny and she was just laughing

463
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.450
because I made her uncomfortable because I was at the game by myself and I just

464
00:26:21.451 --> 00:26:25.500
burst out laughing.
So I think I came off as like a crazy person.
All right.

465
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.660
And then,
uh,

466
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.530
<v 1>then I,
then,
then,
then,
then all this shit starts happening.
Okay.</v>

467
00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.420
And intertwined with all of this is like the trail of tears that for some reason

468
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.750
the NFL,
I don't know what they're trying to do.

469
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:46.710
I understand that a lot of people suffering in the world.
I get it.
I do benefits,

470
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:50.830
I give to charities,
you know,
I,
I,

471
00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:55.060
I try to do my fucking part.
I don't know what the solution is.

472
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.830
I don't know why we can't get along.

473
00:26:56.831 --> 00:26:59.140
I don't know why there's disease and all that,
but we,

474
00:26:59.141 --> 00:27:04.090
but what we do have is we have music and we have sports and it's a way to kind

475
00:27:04.091 --> 00:27:04.880
of get away from it,

476
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.680
<v 5>right?
This is what the fuck I saw him at the game.
Okay.
The game starts.</v>

477
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.603
<v 0>Okay.</v>

478
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.140
<v 5>They have a veteran who is missing a leg runs out with the flag.
Okay.</v>

479
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.890
Which is uplifting,
but also depressing.
He lost his leg.
I'm like,
ah,

480
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.270
fuck these fucking kids,
man.
This whole fucking generation generations.
Yeah.

481
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.730
<v 1>At this point we gotta be in the second generation that's over there fighting</v>

482
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:30.150
fucking wars.
Why?
Why,
why?
Why do we try to solve things this way?

483
00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.740
It's poor fucking guy met him.
He's losing all the Mr is lost a leg.

484
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.213
<v 0>All right,</v>

485
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.830
<v 1>so I'm thinking about people losing limbs in the war.
The lady goes out,</v>

486
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.050
the lay goes out to sing the national anthem.

487
00:27:44.051 --> 00:27:47.850
Now it was so fucking loud when they announced,
I forget where to cause was.

488
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:50.460
There was some sort of ribbon and it was cancer related.

489
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.430
So we've got the one legged vet and then I'm like,
oh,

490
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.910
fuck the veteran side of Jesus Christ.
God,
how do we get out of this fucking war?

491
00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.220
Right?
I'm thinking about that.

492
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.280
Then I'm thinking about people with cancer and then the coin toss.

493
00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:03.750
They bring this cute little boy out,

494
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:06.720
nine year old kid or something who survived bone marrow cancer,

495
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.410
and then I start thinking,
oh my God,
what if my,
that's horrible.

496
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.070
What if my kid ever got cancer?
How would I handle that or would I do?

497
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.740
Oh my God,
if my kid died,
I'd fucking kill myself.
I stopped.

498
00:28:17.741 --> 00:28:19.880
I'm thinking suicidal fucking thoughts here.

499
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.593
<v 0>All right.</v>

500
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.670
<v 5>Then the fucking game starts when the bladder,
right?</v>

501
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.640
They're playing all this shit loudest fucking Shit,

502
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.040
<v 0>eh?</v>

503
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:35.000
<v 5>I'm trying to shake off all the misery of the world that I've been reminded of</v>

504
00:28:35.001 --> 00:28:37.970
like five different examples and then out of nowhere,

505
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.780
<v 0>yeah,</v>

506
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.110
<v 5>this,</v>

507
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.350
they showed us what they showed this guy on this screen and then they showed

508
00:28:44.351 --> 00:28:48.570
this woman who's married to the guy and she's now a widow because the dude died

509
00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:53.070
in,
in Afghanistan,
and I'm like,
oh my God.
She lost her husband.

510
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.770
Oh,
that poor woman,
that's fucking terrible.

511
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.870
And then they cut to her wearing an Atlantic Falcons Jersey with their two kids

512
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.820
who are now fatherless wearing the Jersey smiling and waving at this giant

513
00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:09.810
fucking flat screen.
And all I'm thinking is like,

514
00:29:09.811 --> 00:29:12.480
those fucking kids are gonna grow up without a father.

515
00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.200
Second doubted three Atlanta.
Right.
I'm just like,
what the fuck?

516
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.400
What is going on here?

517
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.850
<v 1>It was one of the most depressing do.</v>

518
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:25.900
There was like nine minutes left in the first quarter and in case you missed the

519
00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:28.750
veteran running out with one leg,
they fucking showed that again.

520
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.873
<v 0>Okay.</v>

521
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.740
<v 1>And uh,
all I can think at that point,
it's like,</v>

522
00:29:32.741 --> 00:29:34.330
what is the halftime show going to be?

523
00:29:34.331 --> 00:29:36.730
Am I going to watch somebody die in an iron lung?

524
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.530
Well,
their family members holding hands crying and then the PA announcer,

525
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:47.590
it'd be like,
yeah,
that's right.
Look at him.
Look at that misery.

526
00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

527
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.790
<v 3>Do people realize how lucky you are?</v>

528
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:53.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

529
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.070
<v 3>You don't have to spend your life for your own personal separate.</v>

530
00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.770
<v 1>They only got an ax.
Halan.</v>

531
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

532
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.340
<v 3>My Jesus Christ NFL.
Why?
Why stop there?</v>

533
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:05.860
How about every time they fucking throw the ball,

534
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.950
you show me the cow that was slaughtered so they could have this skin anytime

535
00:30:09.951 --> 00:30:11.890
time they shoot tee shirts into the crowd.

536
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:14.830
Why don't you just show me the fucking sweat shop Labor that,

537
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:15.940
that put it together.

538
00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.830
<v 1>You know what it is?
Caring is a great fucking thing.</v>

539
00:30:21.831 --> 00:30:25.220
But how about you pick a cause rather than they did.

540
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.293
<v 0>Okay.</v>

541
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.690
<v 3>I mean,
what did they show in the,
I mean,
I left,</v>

542
00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:32.390
I left with like five minutes left in the second quarter.
It was just like,

543
00:30:32.391 --> 00:30:35.690
you know what?
This is a great stadium.
I want to be here with a friends and shit.

544
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.380
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

545
00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.970
<v 3>And uh,
I'm already depressed and I'm on the fucking road.
I'm missing my family.</v>

546
00:30:40.971 --> 00:30:44.510
I came here to get away from that sadness and I've been reminded that I'm kind

547
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:48.860
of being selfish because there's people have way bigger sadness than I do.

548
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.800
And somewhere in all of that I saw a balloon

549
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.460
<v 1>fucking Dick and balls,</v>

550
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.650
twisted fucking balloon animal while kids were walking by.

551
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:01.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

552
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.570
<v 3>I'll tell you,
it was a hell of a day.
You know,
so I actually,</v>

553
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.690
I saw that the jets were fucking coming at the paths and I was like,

554
00:31:06.691 --> 00:31:08.580
why don't I just go sit in a fucking bar

555
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.560
<v 1>and,
and,
and watch this thing.
This is the other thing too.
Like
I,</v>

556
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.490
I just,
I just don't 100% by

557
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.910
that.
The fucking NFL truly cares that much.

558
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.230
You know what I mean?

559
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.050
Cause you know they got busted whenever they show a veteran in the crowd.

560
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:33.310
We had one of our heroes here Bababababa the whatever branch of the service

561
00:31:33.311 --> 00:31:36.790
they're showing,
they have to pay the NFL.
They considered a recruitment video.

562
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:40.720
Like I'd like a commercial.
I heard they recently adjusted it.
I don't know.

563
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:41.950
But what the fuck?

564
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:43.563
<v 0>Right.</v>

565
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.110
<v 1>How much fucking money do you have to make?
So I believe the owners individually,</v>

566
00:31:49.111 --> 00:31:52.620
I believe that they all care about these causes.
I'm sure all of them have had,

567
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.640
you know,
friends or whatever,
fighting and wars have been touched.
You know,

568
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.130
unfortunately you had a family or a family member,

569
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.100
a friend that got cancer or something like that.

570
00:32:02.101 --> 00:32:06.840
But I really have to believe that just because it is a corporation and the way

571
00:32:06.841 --> 00:32:10.050
that they handled and the way that they've handled their players,

572
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.120
you know what I mean?

573
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:17.550
But all the brain damage and shit and they just fucking ignored it allegedly

574
00:32:17.551 --> 00:32:18.630
after they knew about it.

575
00:32:18.631 --> 00:32:22.020
And then when they did the class action suit against the NFL,
they basically,

576
00:32:22.021 --> 00:32:26.440
we gave every player like 800 or a thousand bucks.
Um,

577
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.950
it just comes off like a PR move.

578
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.840
Like then they feel that they can grow their brand.
This is my conspiracy theory.

579
00:32:33.841 --> 00:32:34.561
I'm not saying I'm right.

580
00:32:34.561 --> 00:32:39.000
I think the NFL resents soccer that it's,

581
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.370
and the UFC that started well after them that also went global.

582
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:47.120
I think they want to go global and I think they've reached the maximum amount of

583
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:51.200
sports fans.
So now they're trying to grow their bay brand through caring.

584
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:51.720
Have you,

585
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.330
everybody's trying to show how much they care or maybe it's a symptom of this

586
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:58.790
fucking social media craziness.

587
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.580
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

588
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:05.500
<v 1>Where everybody's like,
I dunno just going nuts,
screaming and yelling at people.</v>

589
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.900
<v 4>MMM.</v>

590
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.650
<v 1>That they try to get out in front of it and care about every cause that's out</v>

591
00:33:11.651 --> 00:33:15.850
there.
I have no fucking idea,
but all I know is I went to that game,
you know,

592
00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:17.740
going,
all right,
let me kill a day here and forget that,

593
00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:22.150
how much I'm missing my wife and my kid.
And I went there and it's just like,

594
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.530
wow.
I guess the good thing was I realized I don't have a lot.
I don't have,

595
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.320
my troubles aren't as big as other people's troubles,

596
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.510
but Jesus fucking Christ and it fell.
How about you just pick one,

597
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.460
pick one.
You know the Fred socks always had the Jimmy Fund,
you know,

598
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.570
they had that and it was,
that was it.
That was,
I mean cheese.

599
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.900
It was fucking unreal.
So,
um,

600
00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.660
anyways,
having said that,

601
00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:53.340
you got to go to this thing like you got to go to this daddy.

602
00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.030
All right.
Um,
but I would,
before you go to the Falcon Stadium,

603
00:33:58.031 --> 00:34:02.680
I would recommend you watch raising Arizona.
Watch something really funny.

604
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.950
Get yourself in a,

605
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.710
a really elevated mood because they are going to bring you down.

606
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:13.270
They are going to bring you fucking down Jesus Christ.

607
00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.940
You know,
I'm the only thing that they will,
you know,

608
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.640
and plus it's also like what they choose to care about is really fucking like

609
00:34:21.641 --> 00:34:22.780
planned out too.

610
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:27.160
Like I'm waiting for one of those NFL teams to bring out a bunch of fucking

611
00:34:27.161 --> 00:34:30.790
recovered heroin addicts that got addicted to pain pills that they got to the

612
00:34:30.791 --> 00:34:35.791
pharmaceutical industry that is allegedly basically synthetic heroin dealers.

613
00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.440
Why don't they show that?
Oh,
that's right.

614
00:34:38.441 --> 00:34:40.660
Because pharmaceutical companies advertise

615
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.140
on those net where then I could have showed that shit.

616
00:34:44.141 --> 00:34:46.210
They're not going to bite the hand that feeds.
They're not going to go,
well,

617
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:49.300
why do people keep getting cancer?
Why is cancer through the fucking roof?

618
00:34:49.301 --> 00:34:50.470
Let's look at pesticides.

619
00:34:50.471 --> 00:34:53.760
Let's look at what we're doing to our food supply has stayed away from that.

620
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.820
Stay away from that,
um,
pig on the military,

621
00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.430
big on the military to the point literally of like,

622
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:04.510
I felt in a way that I was sort of in like a clockwork orange and they should

623
00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:08.020
have just had my eyes taped open as they're selling me,
you know,

624
00:35:08.021 --> 00:35:11.950
our foreign policy like squirting tears into my eyes.
It's just like,

625
00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.130
you know,
it's like guys,

626
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:19.360
what's your getting involved with is way more complex than a football game.
Okay.

627
00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:23.500
So just keep it simple,
stupid as people have always told me.
So anyways,

628
00:35:23.501 --> 00:35:27.040
that was my experience.
Um,
overall it was a great experience.

629
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.720
I feel bad that I left the fucking game.

630
00:35:28.721 --> 00:35:31.330
My mother always taught me never to leave the game and I left and the dolphins

631
00:35:31.331 --> 00:35:35.170
came back and won and oh,
by the way,
he was another loud thing.

632
00:35:35.171 --> 00:35:37.440
Anytime it was third down,
this is fucking hilarious.

633
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:41.160
Anytime we started down this fucking lunatic,
we just go,

634
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.220
<v 0>uh,</v>

635
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:46.763
<v 3>sorry</v>

636
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.640
<v 1>to get the crowd like amped up.
And it's just like,
dude,</v>

637
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.020
I have a flat screen TV in front of me that is easily two and a half times the

638
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:58.440
size of my fucking house.
And it says third and two.
I can see it.

639
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.773
<v 4>MMM.</v>

640
00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.410
<v 1>I Dunno.
But having said all that,</v>

641
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.710
I'm going to give a shout out here to the,

642
00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.480
whoever the fuck designed that fucking stadium.
It is unbelievable.
It's gorgeous.

643
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.480
And the college Superbowl is there this year.

644
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:18.770
She want to blow some fucking money and the super bowl's going to be there next

645
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.390
year.
It's fucking amazing.
It's amazing.
And the NFL cares,

646
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.440
you know,
it's another great one is Ford Ford Motor Company.

647
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:34.070
They got a tie out there where they go 100% of the proceeds go to fight cancer,

648
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.040
which is great cause a lot of times it's a portion of the proceeds and they keep

649
00:36:37.041 --> 00:36:40.200
a lot of it.
So I will commend forward for that.
But what's hilarious is,

650
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:44.720
is their website and suddenly like Ford cares.com.
It's like,
well,
it's glad.

651
00:36:44.721 --> 00:36:47.600
I'm glad you care about that because you certainly didn't give a fuck what you

652
00:36:47.601 --> 00:36:52.010
put the gas taken,
the Pinto and the crown Vic.
Did Ya?
Um,

653
00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:56.780
anyways.
All right,
that's it.
I'm done with my sports rants here.
But uh,

654
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.990
thank you to the NFL and thank you to the world of college sports.

655
00:36:59.991 --> 00:37:03.440
You guys got me through this fucking weekend.
The loneliness.
Uh,

656
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.160
thank you to the new punchline in Atlanta.
Um,

657
00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:10.010
I got to do a spot there last night in the laughing skull down the street.

658
00:37:10.011 --> 00:37:15.011
I've been having a great time trying to stay sharp with my act and uh,

659
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.660
I guys,
I can't tell you the name of them.
I don't,
I don't know what I can,

660
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.610
I can't talk about the movie that I'm in,
but I think,

661
00:37:19.611 --> 00:37:21.890
I think this one's going to be a fucking good one,
dude.

662
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.080
I am like really excited looking at all of like,

663
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.083
<v 4>mmm.</v>

664
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.290
<v 1>The shots that the direct,</v>

665
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.540
I don't want to say the director's name cause I never know what the fuck he can

666
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:36.650
say and can't say.
But the fucking shots that I've been seeing,

667
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.190
it's literally I'm sitting like,
dude,
I'm going to be fucking in this thing now.

668
00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:42.530
Watch.
They're going to cut my,
cut my part out.

669
00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.390
What am I going to learn to keep my fucking mouth shut?
All right.
You know what?

670
00:37:50.391 --> 00:37:53.870
Let's uh,
let's do a little advertising here.

671
00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.550
<v 3>All right.
What do we got here?
I'm me undies.
Everybody be on ds.
Aw me undies.</v>

672
00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.980
Stop showing people die in the new dude to be on these.
Mandy's.

673
00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.230
I'm at a football game.
Why am I crying?
I get dead.

674
00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:10.090
People have fucking cancer.

675
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.300
People die in wars.

676
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.770
Don't wear from can I just watch this fucking game?
You NFL,

677
00:38:17.771 --> 00:38:22.120
greedy con.
Stop acting like you care.
All right,

678
00:38:22.121 --> 00:38:27.121
me undies makes Andries de your butt will be proud to wear and check this out.

679
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.650
I'm not the only one who loves me undies.

680
00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:34.900
Listen to what my longtime listener and me undies enthusiast George has to say.

681
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.920
A note from George N,
a bill,

682
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:42.520
burr listener and me undies fan.
What fucking big brother's shit is this?

683
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:47.200
I've never met this guy.
Anyways,
this guy said,
and there's no last name,

684
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:51.790
how do we know this person exists?
George and George?
Nonexistent.

685
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:55.780
I decided to try out Mondays because I love bill burns me undies,
jingles.

686
00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.490
I smile every time he sings it.
Somehow I feel like the clean this up.

687
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:01.930
<v 6>Okay.</v>

688
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:06.200
<v 3>I smile.
I bet he really said,
dad.</v>

689
00:39:06.201 --> 00:39:10.450
I like the way he sings to fucking songs.
Dude.
I fucking laugh my balls off.

690
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:14.020
Then they clean it all up.
I smile every time he thinks it.

691
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.600
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

692
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.880
<v 3>Second and three.
Atlanta.
Uh,</v>

693
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.880
although it's so easy to skip ads in a podcast.

694
00:39:20.881 --> 00:39:25.410
I always listened to bill's reads and I'm so glad me undies has stuck with them.

695
00:39:25.411 --> 00:39:26.160
I've been,

696
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.120
it's been probably two years since I first bought a pair of me undies and now I

All right.

761
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.080
I guess what I started watching yesterday on Netflix,

762
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:34.550
I watched,
I watched the first episode of Narcos and uh,

763
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.380
I,
it's funny,
I tried to watch it the first time and I dunno,

764
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.630
I think the subtitles,
I got intimidated because in the beginning there's,

765
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:42.991
there's,

766
00:43:42.991 --> 00:43:46.800
they have this whole fucking thing about magical mysticism or some bullshit like

767
00:43:46.801 --> 00:43:49.860
that and it's on the screen,
whatever the paragraph is before that,

768
00:43:49.861 --> 00:43:53.670
it goes by too fucking quick.
I can't read it.
And then I'm just like,
okay,

769
00:43:53.671 --> 00:43:55.230
if this is going to be the pace of the reading,

770
00:43:55.231 --> 00:43:58.740
I'm not going to be able to keep up with it.
Well,
anyways,
I'm lonely on the road.

771
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.450
I finally figured out my Netflix account.
It's fucking hilarious.

772
00:44:03.451 --> 00:44:07.770
I've got a show on Netflix and I never watch it because I,
I just,
I dunno,

773
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.330
I just,
I don't interact well with computers and all of this shit.

774
00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:13.590
And then once his passwords,

775
00:44:13.591 --> 00:44:16.110
I'm going to forget the password and then I'm going to say,

776
00:44:16.111 --> 00:44:19.260
email me my password and then somehow it's going to end up in my junk folder and

777
00:44:19.261 --> 00:44:21.510
I won't be able to find it.
I just figured,
you know what?
Fuck it.

778
00:44:21.511 --> 00:44:25.860
I'll just put it on the TV and watch the Rockford files.
Right.
Well,

779
00:44:25.861 --> 00:44:30.270
I finally figured it out and I watched the first episode of Narcos and I'm 100%

780
00:44:30.271 --> 00:44:34.770
in what a God damn show.
Also,
by the way,
uh,

781
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.190
the producers of the show,
whatever the production company,

782
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:39.180
whatever you say is gold mine,

783
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:43.890
which also does theF is for family o fucking gray today.
Um,

784
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:49.170
so anyways,
uh,
when I watched that first fucking episode,

785
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:55.130
when he's sitting there talking to those army guys and starts to naming their

786
00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:57.930
names,
um,

787
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.890
when Pablo Escobar's doing that and he,
and he starts,
you know,

788
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:06.300
just letting them know that he knows all of their families members and like

789
00:45:06.301 --> 00:45:09.220
basically,
you know,
without saying it's something bad's going to happen to him,

790
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.620
I still don't understand why they just didn't take a gun and blow his fucking

791
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:17.010
brains out.
There's no loyalty

792
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:22.950
in,
uh,
in that world.
Once you fucking killed him then all,

793
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.170
then they would,

794
00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.140
<v 0>yeah,</v>

795
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.080
<v 3>they,
you,
you cut the head off the snake.
I'm,
I know I'm over simplifying this,</v>

796
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.160
but I'm just saying this,
if there's any DEA agents that are listening here,

797
00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:37.390
if he just blew his fucking brains out right then and there wouldn't all the

798
00:45:37.391 --> 00:45:41.550
other gangsters underneath him one and then be the next Pablo Escobar.

799
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:45.720
So then they would start fighting with each other.
Wouldn't that happen?

800
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:48.110
And then they would have to establish,
then they would have to pay off.

801
00:45:48.111 --> 00:45:51.840
They'd have to start all over again.
Like,
Hey,
we had to deal with Pablo.

802
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.790
He paid us off.
You didn't,
you know,

803
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.160
when it started all over again and then they wouldn't have time to come after

804
00:45:56.161 --> 00:45:59.080
your family.
I know,
I know.

805
00:45:59.081 --> 00:46:02.680
I probably totally fucking oversimplified that fucking thing that night.
Um,

806
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.360
all right.
Well how much time do I have left here?
Oh,

807
00:46:07.361 --> 00:46:12.040
Billy's got to hit the fucking treadmill.
Alright.
Keep his little fucking,

808
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.660
you know,
you haven't been boozing.
I've been doing our rate.

809
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.070
I haven't been doing the greatest,
I've been fucking,
I'm not gonna lie to yet,

810
00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:23.890
but I'm in a,
I'm in a fucking male depression right now,
but I'm going to see my,

811
00:46:23.891 --> 00:46:27.350
uh,
my wife and my daughter this week.
Hopefully.
Um,

812
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.200
I have some,
I'm going to,
I'm going to get them out here.
All right.
Okay.

813
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.960

816
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.640
This can be a total fucking train wreck no matter what.

817
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.960
It's going to be exciting.

818

Um,

838
00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.060
all right,
let's get to the questions here.
All right,
Bill,

839
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:08.680
did everyone know about Harvey Weinstein and then parentheses from a lady?

840
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.460
All right.
I don't know why he had to let me know it was from a woman.
Okay.
Hey,

841
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:12.761
bill,

842
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:17.740
I'm a big fan of your podcast and your show I saw in Montreal earlier this year

843
00:48:17.741 --> 00:48:22.510
was epic.
Seeing a master at work is a beautiful thing.
Ah,
yeah.
Buttered me up.

844
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:27.890
You buttered me up.
I have a lot of respect for you as a straight forward guy.
Oh,

845
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.610
look.
See how this person's brilliant.
She's gone.
You know,

846
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:34.450
you're a fucking brilliant at what you do.
I know that you never lie.

847
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.100
This is great.

848
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.430
This is the way you ask a question if you want to get it onto stand.
Sir.
Uh,

849
00:48:39.431 --> 00:48:42.790
you're one of the few,
I'll believe unequivocally on this subject.

850
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:47.200
Do you think everyone in Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein?

851
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.590
I can totally understand how no one spoke out until now.

852
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.070
He was fucking scary and clearly had the precedence pocket.

853
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.980
I'd like to think I would have spoken out,
but honestly,

854
00:48:56.981 --> 00:49:00.970
I probably would have put my fucking life and career on the line with little

855
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.440
chance of taking him down.

856
00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.760
I just wish all the stars feigning shock would just be honest and admit they

857
00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:11.350
knew they didn't have the balls,
parentheses or were too smart to step up.

858
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:15.640
We'd love to hear needs thoughts on this.
So,
and I,
but she's not here.

859
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:20.641
Congratulations on your amazing love hearing about you being a dead.

860
00:49:20.801 --> 00:49:24.160
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,
all right.
First of all,

861
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:28.540
thank you for talking to me as if I'm on the big star level and I know what all

862
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:32.740
of them think.
Um,
I gotta be honest with you.

863
00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:35.830
I didn't know a fucking thing about that guy other than he had a lot of hit

864
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:36.723
movies.

865
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:38.583
<v 4>MMM.</v>

866
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.940
<v 3>I came up as a standup comedian and uh,</v>

867
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:49.180
have risen to the having a vulgar animated show on Netflix.

868
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:52.100
That's,
that's the level I got to.

869
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:56.330
So I've done some movies

870
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:57.490
<v 4>okay.</v>

871
00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:01.210
<v 3>With some pretty big people,
but his name never came up,</v>

872
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:02.800
so

873
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:03.920
<v 4>okay.</v>

874
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.150
<v 3>If I had a guest,</v>

875
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.570
I imagine a lot of people knew that he fucked around on his wife.

876
00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.060
This is all speculation.

877
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:12.410
<v 4>MMM.</v>

878
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.660
<v 3>I have no,
but I don't,
I don't know.</v>

879
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.060
I think the women that he did it too,
obviously,
you know,

880
00:50:21.061 --> 00:50:24.810
allegedly you got to say a legend not trying to get sued here.

881
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:28.160
It's still all allegedly has not been convicted of the

882
00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.530
<v 1>58 people that came out with the same fucking story.
It's all alleged.</v>

883
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.260
Um,

884
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:40.770
I'd have to think that they knew and then their friends would know.

885
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.590
But how far it goes from that?
It's,
it's,
it's,
uh,
I don't know.

886
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.630
I have no idea.
I ain't got to be honest with you.

887
00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.610
We were in between takes and,
uh,

888
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.970
on the movie and we were shooting in this fucking really cool fucking motel man.

889
00:51:00.971 --> 00:51:02.390
I thought it goes in a Coen brothers movie.

890
00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.260
So one of the rooms we had was like the little green room and they will,
they,

891
00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:09.650
the story was on and these women were coming forward and like

892
00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:16.680
my mouth was literally a gape listening to it.
I,

893
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.440
I can't,
I be honest.
All I can straight from me.

894
00:51:19.441 --> 00:51:24.441
I can't fucking believe somebody could do that and get away with it for that

895
00:51:24.661 --> 00:51:26.070
fucking lie.
I mean,

896
00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.540
and did the tape of that fucking woman

897
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:36.930
and how that isn't enough
I guess.
Cause he never said yes,

898
00:51:36.931 --> 00:51:41.850
I grabbed your boob.
I think he just keeps going.
Like I understand.

899
00:51:41.851 --> 00:51:46.110
Just come and I just got,
I,
I'm used to this.
I'm used to this.

900
00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.740
None of that is an admission.
All right.

901
00:51:49.741 --> 00:51:52.710
Then one more just because you're used to this like,

902
00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:54.100
<v 0>okay,</v>

903
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.290
<v 1>I dunno,
I just got to be honest.
Do,</v>

904
00:51:55.291 --> 00:51:58.090
it's the most disgusting fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.

905
00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.310
And if this guy is as guilty as he looks,

906
00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:02.890
I'm worried that he's not going to go to jail

907
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.710
because I don't know what evidence there is.
And,

908
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.390
and the statute of limit limitations,
I,
you know,

909
00:52:11.391 --> 00:52:16.280
you're going back decades with the shit.
I don't know how it fucking works.
Uh,

910
00:52:16.281 --> 00:52:17.630
but in a perfect world,

911
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:20.960
they take them out to the desert and they put two by in his fucking ear.
I mean,

912
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:26.180
if he's guilty,
if he's innocent,
I think I just fucked my whole career.

913
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.820
Um,
I have,
I have no idea.

914
00:52:34.821 --> 00:52:37.520
I don't know who knew what or whatever,
but I will tell you,

915
00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.230
I've been enjoying watching Fox News,

916
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:43.220
having a field day with this trashing Hollywood.

917
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:45.060
Um,

918
00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:45.893
<v 0>yeah.</v>

919
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:49.450
<v 1>And you know,</v>

920
00:52:49.451 --> 00:52:53.100
given that guy who was in the fucking hot tub with the 13 year old girls till

921
00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:56.320
now hides out in France,
giving him an award and all that Shit,

922
00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:01.240
uh,
I love watching them called Hollywood out.

923
00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:06.070
I love watching Hannity,
calling out the hypocrisy of Hollywood,

924
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.350
you know,

925
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:13.030
trashing Donald Trump for what the fuck he's doing while bad shit's going on in

926
00:53:13.031 --> 00:53:13.864
their own town.

927
00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:19.110
And then all the while Hannity never bringing up and bill O'Reilly while saying

928
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.140
that the friend went,
the fuck is that guy.
I always forget his name,

929
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.370
the French dude there,
whatever guy had an out in France

930
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.690
<v 3>or whatever saying,</v>

931
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:30.750
and they gave this guy in a award afterwards and it's just like,
yeah.

932
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:33.990
And you had bill O'Reilly on your show afterward,

933
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:39.150
so everybody is like,
I dunno.
It's just such a fucking amazing time

934
00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.630
for that shit.
Hillary Clinton complaining about the fucking,

935
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.433
uh,

936
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:51.230
electoral college while the Democratic Party went to court and admitted,

937
00:53:51.231 --> 00:53:53.480
admitted that Bernie Sanders got more votes,

938
00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:58.100
but they colluded with the Hillary's,
uh,
you know,
campaign to be like,
no,

939
00:53:58.101 --> 00:54:01.970
you give us the best shot,
so we're going to pick you fuck what the people say.

940
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:06.290
I Dunno.
I don't fucking know.

941
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:10.250
And then me saying that I fucking hate listening to people talk politics.

942
00:54:10.251 --> 00:54:13.850
And then here I am talking to,
uh,
yeah,

943
00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:18.310
I have no idea who knew what.
But I would definitely say that,
you know,

944
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.970
uh,
the same way like Fox News,
there's no fucking way.

945
00:54:22.971 --> 00:54:26.420
They didn't know that Bill O'reilly was settling out of court in these fucking

946
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:28.460
things.
You know,

947
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.060
this the same way that there's no way at the Weinstein company.

948
00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.550
They didn't know something was amiss.

949
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.423
<v 0>MMM.</v>

950
00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:42.320
<v 3>I just don't,
I don't,
I'd be honest with you.
I am as shocked as anybody else.</v>

951
00:54:42.321 --> 00:54:46.770
I just don't fucking get it.
I,
I don't,
uh,

952
00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:51.040
I don't understand.
It's just one of the worst fucking things

953
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:55.130
I know I have.
No,
I don't have any jokes.

954
00:54:55.131 --> 00:54:57.440
It's just one of the most disgusting fucking things I've ever heard.

955
00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:01.970
And I don't want to pay attention to the story because I don't think he's going

956
00:55:01.971 --> 00:55:05.420
to go to jail and listening to his comments.

957
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:08.900
He's the typical piece of shit that does stuff like that where he actually feels

958
00:55:08.901 --> 00:55:12.050
like the victim.
You know what I mean?

959
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.630
He's making it about himself and how bad he feels,
you know,
fuck the victims,

960
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:20.690
you know,
whatever the alleged victims,
what,
and I don't,
I don't fucking know.

961
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:21.650
I don't know what people knew,

962
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:26.510
but somebody knew something and they should have fucking said something.
Um,

963
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.290
anyways.
All right,
asshole neighbor threatening our dogs.

964
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:36.330
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
Sorry dear Billy butter tits.
Hey,
I'm in good shape right now.

965
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:40.290
By the way,
could you guys just insult me in a little more?
You know,

966
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:47.390
Billy,
how about Billy chiseled a albino chesty,
you know,
something like that.

967
00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.560
I'm not sure whatever.

968
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:54.250
I'm a lady lady you wrote into my fucking podcast and I love you.

969
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:57.920
I'm a lady and my twenties,

970
00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:01.580
late twenties here in the southeast United States,

971
00:56:01.581 --> 00:56:06.110
and I have an issue with an older male neighbor.
Okay,
but brave as possible.

972
00:56:06.111 --> 00:56:07.310
Why am I doing this accent,

973
00:56:07.311 --> 00:56:12.311
this asshole caves comment on or my property [inaudible] and let our dogs out of

974
00:56:13.371 --> 00:56:16.900
the fence.
Oh my God,

975
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:22.000
I you need to beat this guy in the bottom of his feet.
Don't do that.

976
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:25.780
By the way,
I don't condone violence is never an answer.
Uh,

977
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:29.350
we live next door to a busy road and I hate to think what would happen if

978
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:32.860
someone came speeding down and hit one of my dogs.
I have a big yard,

979
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:36.490
so he has to come over into our property to open the gate.

980
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.100
He waits until we lead to do it.

981
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:42.550
And it's easy to go down to the spy shop and get some cameras because some of

982
00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:43.780
our neighbors snitched on him.

983
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.500
He's an old white trash dude that sits on his porch smoking all day.

984
00:56:47.501 --> 00:56:51.130
And he claims that our dogs bark 24 seven,
they don't.

985
00:56:51.131 --> 00:56:54.730
And the rest of the neighbors have said they don't hear the barking or when they

986
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:57.890
do,
it's minimal.
All right?
This is what I would do.
I would get,

987
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.890
I would get a lock on my fence,
okay.
That he can't get past.

988
00:57:02.891 --> 00:57:06.250
And then I would,
uh,
go down to the spy shop and get some cameras.

989
00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:11.260
And then what I would also do is let them know I would write a letter and say

990
00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:14.680
that that's what you've done.
Okay.
Just so,

991
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:18.640
because God forbid he jumps over the fence,
throws your dog's over,

992
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:21.050
and then they get hit and died,
you know,

993
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.140
then I'll keep it die and you're going to be like,
all right,

994
00:57:23.141 --> 00:57:25.060
when I caught the guy,
but what are your dog's had to die?

995
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.710
What you really want to do is just make,
prevent this guy from doing it.

996
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:31.330
So let them know that you know what he's doing,

997
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:35.140
that you've taken these measures and then maybe he will fuck off because you

998
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:38.710
know,
who wants to see a dog die and then an old guy go to jail or whatever.

999
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.690
Um,
just stay on your porch or build.
All right,
buddy,

1000
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:49.090
get him a pair of fucking,
uh,
wireless headphones,

1001
00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.390
you know,
so he can listen to Bob do boop,
boop,
boop.

1002
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:55.690
[inaudible] but when his fucking head phones anyways,
he goes,

1003
00:57:55.691 --> 00:57:57.640
my question is what the hell do I,
that's what she says.

1004
00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:01.500
My question is what the hell do I do?
I've started locking the gates,

1005
00:58:01.501 --> 00:58:03.190
so that shouldn't be a problem anymore.

1006
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:06.040
But one of the Sasol tries to poison them or something and that's where the

1007
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:09.280
cameras come in.
I'm probably being paranoid,
but I'm pissed off.

1008
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:12.910
I also have a temper,
which doesn't help.
What do I do,
Bill?
Oh,

1009
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.230
you're asking a guy who has a temper,
ah,
boom.

1010
00:58:15.231 --> 00:58:18.880
Immediately suggests you beat the bottom of the guy's feet.
Um,

1011
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:20.800
I've heard you talk about dealing with the old people,

1012
00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:23.440
neighbors and I'd really like your advice thing.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Yeah,

1013
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:28.360
he's an old guy,
you know,
you know,
I would just,

1014
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:31.240
I would send a letter over there and say,

1015
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:33.970
I apologize if you find my dog's annoying.
Uh,

1016
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:38.350
other neighbors say they don't bark that bed.
Here's a pair of fucking earplugs.

1017
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.680
And some old man fucking,
I dunno what you give him,

1018
00:58:41.681 --> 00:58:43.390
give him some broths or some shit.

1019
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.290
We're now locking the fence so you can no longer go in there.

1020
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:51.230
And I also have a camera set up.
Okay.
I don't want us,
you know,

1021
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.070
I would just do that whenever the fuck I said earlier.
I would do that.

1022
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.550
And then anything,
every time you seem,
even if he tells you to go fuck yourself,

1023
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.570
just smile and wave and just tell him,
uh,
it's nice to see you.

1024
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.870
I hope you have a wonderful day.
I would just do that.
All right.

1025
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.640
And then if you ever have a hard house party,

1026
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:11.380
I would invite him over and just tried to kill them with kindness rather than

1027
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:15.970
beating the bottom of his feet.
All right.
Dating and Asia.
Asia,
Asia.

1028
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:20.110
Oh,
this is interesting.
I never even,
I never heard about any of this.
Dear Billy.

1029
00:59:20.111 --> 00:59:23.540
Me undies stains.
Ah,
I like that one.
Good for you.
All right.

1030
00:59:23.541 --> 00:59:27.980
I been living in Asia for the last four years and dating has been tricky.

1031
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.300
Asian girls are beautiful kind and much more giving and bed than their white

1032
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:36.290
counterparts.
I don't know what the fuck that means.

1033
00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:42.350
I'm certainly punching above my weight class here.
All right.

1034
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:44.290
You're punching these women.
Um,

1035
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.830
I think the better thing is saying that you out kicked your coverage and having

1036
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:52.700
relationships slash one night stands with a much higher quality of girl.

1037
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.290
Uh,
then I,
when I was back in the u s two,
this is the deal.

1038
00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:01.340
You're over there and you have an accent.
Okay.

1039
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.500
That's it.
Same Way if you come over here,
if you have a fucking accident,

1040
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:09.470
the women like it does that work with Asian guys?

1041
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:12.110
If you come over here and you have an accent with Asian women,

1042
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:14.600
I have no fucking idea anyways.
However,

1043
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.330
the biggest problem is they are boring.

1044
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:21.680
Most spend their whole life studying until they are 26.

1045
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.360
Then they work insane hours at work.
Uh,

1046
01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.370
and they live with their parents until they get married.

1047
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:32.930
Not to mention that my sense of humor can be totally lost on someone who speaks

1048
01:00:32.931 --> 01:00:35.330
English as a second or third language.
Yeah.
Well,
dude,

1049
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.430
you're on the other side of the world.
Things are going to be different here.

1050
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:39.680
I seem to be stuck between beautiful,

1051
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:43.430
boring Asian girls and the typical basic white girl.

1052
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.410
I'd apologize for this sweeping generalizations,
but you do it all the time.

1053
01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:53.730
Uh,
do I do it like that?
What a fucking cunt do.

1054
01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:58.270
Can you own your continuous and not fucking get yet you to fucking twat stench

1055
01:00:58.271 --> 01:01:03.130
on me.
Uh,
I know I'm a fucking moron.
I don't know.
You do eat a pointed out.

1056
01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:07.330
Oh.
Boohoo I'm on the other side of the world.
Fucking a bunch of hot Asian girls.

1057
01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:11.980
Uh,
you got a girl that was way too good for you,

1058
01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:15.280
so I'd love to hear what you think.
All right.
I agree with that.
Thanks.

1059
01:01:15.281 --> 01:01:19.210
And Go have a wonderful day.
I,
uh,
I live in Korea and I love it.

1060
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.400
Didn't want to talk shit.
Um,
well dude,

1061
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:27.550
you're either going to have to accept that those are your options or move out of

1062
01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:30.730
there.
I don't know what to tell you.
Um,

1063
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:35.800
do you want the entire country to change because you are there.

1064
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:41.670
It sounds like there's a bunch of smart women over there that are there.

1065
01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.080
That's perfect.

1066
01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:45.923
<v 0>Right?</v>

1067
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.680
<v 3>They're educated,
they're working their asses off the fucking,
the,</v>

1068
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:55.340
they're the bunch of animals in the rack.
Well,
what is the problem?

1069
01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.670
Um,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

1070
01:02:00.671 --> 01:02:03.490
I would start dating a prostitute over there if you want a little more

1071
01:02:03.491 --> 01:02:07.420
excitement.
Um,
sounds like you live in the dream over there buddy.

1072
01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:12.640
I,
if I was you,
I would try to appreciate what you have.
I mean,
I don't,

1073
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.110
I mean,
that's kind of perfect.

1074
01:02:17.111 --> 01:02:21.000
What she fucking blows your mind in bed and goes off and goes studies and then

1075
01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:22.280
you can sit down and watch the game.

1076
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.223
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1077
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:29.050
<v 3>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I don't know exactly what else you want from him,
but,
uh,</v>

1078
01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.060
I have all the problems to have in the world.

1079
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:34.600
Certainly after all the problems that I learned in the world in the first

1080
01:02:34.601 --> 01:02:37.630
fucking seven minutes of that Falcons game.
I don't,

1081
01:02:37.631 --> 01:02:40.670
I really don't have any fucking sympathy for you.
Alright.

1082
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:45.130
Heckled by veteran comedian.
Uh,
it's fucking hilarious.
Hello,
Billy.

1083
01:02:45.131 --> 01:02:48.850
Bald for skin.
Um,
hey,

1084
01:02:48.851 --> 01:02:50.680
after about two months ago,

1085
01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.410
and I don't know if they make it fun of my Dick there or what am I head looks

1086
01:02:53.411 --> 01:02:56.590
like?
But uh,
either way.
It's funny,
about two months ago,

1087
01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.310
I gave the open mic night a try.
Oh,
he heckled you as an open miker that's,

1088
01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:02.200
that's fucking not good.

1089
01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:06.130
I prepared for it for a while and finally worked up the nerve to do it.

1090
01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:11.020
Had material add some semblance,
semblance of a planned attempt.

1091
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.800
I get about four minutes into it.
I'm getting labs.

1092
01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:20.450
Not a lot,
but some,
and a bunch of smiles.
All right,
good for you.
Plus,

1093
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.150
and they leave in the beginning of all,
it's about,

1094
01:03:22.151 --> 01:03:24.490
it's just having the balls to go up there when they call your name.

1095
01:03:24.491 --> 01:03:27.490
It has nothing to do with how well you do anyways.

1096
01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:31.600
So I was confident and busted out a joke that was a little racy,

1097
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.330
but nothing means spirited.
Knowing laughed.
Oh,

1098
01:03:34.331 --> 01:03:39.331
well I moved on a few days go by and I'm getting hate on Facebook for the joke

1099
01:03:40.091 --> 01:03:44.920
from a comedian that has been working the scene for longer than I've been alive.

1100
01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:49.900
Oh Jesus,
Jesus.
Really?

1101
01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.373
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1102
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:55.180
<v 3>Comic con comic violence.
Uh,
yeah.
Hate to see it.</v>

1103
01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.630
I take what he says his wisdom,

1104
01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:03.010
but he tells me that you shouldn't ever say anything on stage.

1105
01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:04.630
You don't believe in,

1106
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:10.430
uh,
wait a minute.
Wait,
we're not waiting,

1107
01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:12.150
but you're saying you're getting hate on Facebook.

1108
01:04:12.151 --> 01:04:14.460
This guy is basically giving you advice

1109
01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:21.790
and being heckled.
Heckled is your,
it's interrupting a live performance.

1110
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.260
You don't get heckled on Facebook.
He,

1111
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:28.270
when they see the comedian heckled the crowd,

1112
01:04:28.271 --> 01:04:30.340
the crowd is not giving a performance.

1113
01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1114
01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:33.050
<v 3>Uh,
I,</v>

1115
01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:37.850
I called bullshit on that and always thought as a comedian you get to push the

1116
01:04:37.851 --> 01:04:41.270
envelope some because when it's all said and done,

1117
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:45.980
as long as you weren't hateful for the sake of,
hey,
you're good.
Anyways.

1118
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:49.700
I've haven't had the nerve to go back on stage out of the fear of getting

1119
01:04:49.701 --> 01:04:54.430
trashed on Facebook.
Anyways,
love the podcast.
I hope you come to Memphis soon.

1120
01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:59.340
Right?
And Go make love to yourself.
Also.
I can't get hard.

1121
01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:03.060
Please fix this with magic.
Um,

1122
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:08.580
all right.
Uh,
first of all,
I don't know what you said.

1123
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:12.990
I'd have to know the joke that you said.
I know how you feel about the joke.

1124
01:05:12.991 --> 01:05:15.000
I know all the other comic feels about the joke,

1125
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:17.890
but it just seems like the comic has given you some advice there.

1126
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:19.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1127
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:21.520
<v 3>I don't know how hard the person went.
Um,</v>

1128
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:22.970
<v 4>okay.</v>

1129
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:24.320
<v 3>Personally I wouldn't do that.</v>

1130
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.350
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1131
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.190
<v 3>But you sound way more seasoned than someone who just did it for the first time.</v>

1132
01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:33.373
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1133
01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.680
<v 3>Wait a minute.
I opened my,
I gave up my could try a pair of,</v>

1134
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:40.130
I prepared for it for a while,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

1135
01:05:40.131 --> 01:05:41.990
I get my full four minutes into it

1136
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.480
getting last and then he did the joke that didn't go well.

1137
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.700
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1138
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.440
<v 3>I mean,
I don't know,
Dude.
I don't,
I don't know.</v>

1139
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.040
I mean,
I wouldn't say that to a,

1140
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.570
to an open miker I also don't know what you said and it doesn't sound,

1141
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:03.580
it just sounds like he's giving you an advice.
Uh,
I can tell you this right now.

1142
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:07.570
If you're going to let one fucking person and some bullshit on Facebook,

1143
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:10.070
um,

1144
01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:15.070
make it not go back on stage then then this guy did you a favor because you

1145
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:17.800
gotta be weights.

1146
01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:21.960
You gotta be way tougher than that because if you think this is the first

1147
01:06:21.961 --> 01:06:25.620
fucking time,
like it's just,
you know,
when I was sitting in that motel,

1148
01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:27.310
<v 0>okay,</v>

1149
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:30.440
<v 3>well we were shooting the other day,
I walked in and I just laughed.
I was like,</v>

1150
01:06:30.441 --> 01:06:32.030
all these places smell the same.

1151
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1152
01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:38.290
<v 3>And what are the actors asked me?
He goes,
what's the worst Gig you've ever had?</v>

1153
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:41.530
And I thought about it for a second and then I just laughed and I was just like

1154
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.260
that.
It's just too big a subject

1155
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:49.690
for me to pick any one gig.
I mean,

1156
01:06:49.691 --> 01:06:51.830
you literally have to go like,

1157
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.360
<v 4>mmm,</v>

1158
01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.130
<v 3>worst gig without a microphone.</v>

1159
01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:00.630
Worst Gig in a cafeteria where they didn't know that there was a show worse

1160
01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:04.420
nooner
worse.
Uh,

1161
01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:08.050
you know,
am I going to get the shit kicked out of me?

1162
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:10.450
Worst gig where I didn't get paid worst Gig,

1163
01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:13.300
where the fucking middle lap was a former headliner.

1164
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:17.320
And he did 45 to an hour in front of me and tried to burn out the crowd.
Yeah,

1165
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.730
you got white crowds.
She got black crowds.
You got college crowds.

1166
01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:24.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1167
01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.570
<v 3>Cruise ships.
I mean it's just,
it's just,</v>

1168
01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.020
and I,
you know what's funny is I haven't forgotten any of them,

1169
01:07:33.021 --> 01:07:34.820
but I can't remember any of them either.

1170
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:40.570
They just all are this giant ball of any um,

1171
01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.850
hate and humiliation
and um,

1172
01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:45.793
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1173
01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.830
<v 3>that's what you're signing up for.
And I'm not trying to discourage you here.</v>

1174
01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:50.670
And what it is,

1175
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:55.670
is what you need right now rather than writing to me is you need to go to more

1176
01:07:56.401 --> 01:07:59.130
open mikes and what's going to happen is that you're going to get comedian

1177
01:07:59.131 --> 01:08:04.050
friends from your graduation class.
Right.

1178
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:09.330
And what you do,
how you get through all of that was I used to call up,

1179
01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.510
you know,
the comics that I started out with.
Like if I had,

1180
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:18.860
I remember having some brutal show in front of a bunch of cops when he started

1181
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:23.060
up and he ate his ball so bad that he called me up

1182
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:26.090
and through talking to me,

1183
01:08:26.091 --> 01:08:31.091
he was able to laugh about it and then I was laughing about it and you know,

1184
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.490
then when I bombed all the fucking time,
I would call him up.

1185
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:36.680
You tell the stories,

1186
01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:40.880
then what becomes is then other comics trying to top your story about the worst

1187
01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:45.660
gig that they ever fucking had.
And that's what it just starts to become.

1188
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.970
As you're going through it.

1189
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.950
You just get seasoned and then you're just all literally on stage going through

1190
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:54.710
some of the worst humiliation of your life while thinking,

1191
01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:58.460
I can't wait to tell this to,
uh,
my buddy when I get home or whatever.
I mean,

1192
01:08:58.461 --> 01:09:03.380
just don't let this fucking guy discourage you.
Fucking shake it off.

1193
01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.000
You don't,
you gotta be like a relief pitcher.
You fucking gave up all run.

1194
01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.170
Give me another ball.
I'm going to get,
I'm going,
if I'm coming right back,

1195
01:09:10.171 --> 01:09:13.110
what they hate,
you gotta be like that.
Um,

1196
01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:17.640
I'm not saying that comic is right or wrong.
Um,

1197
01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:19.710
cause I don't know what you said.

1198
01:09:20.190 --> 01:09:23.510
He evidently felt it was serious enough to reach out to you on Facebook.
But,
uh,

1199
01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.140
I,
I,
it's not something I would've done.

1200
01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:30.150
I don't try to be the comedy fucking cop here.
Um,
all right,

1201
01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.060
so good luck with you sir.
All right.
It's Joe Barton.

1202
01:09:35.061 --> 01:09:39.490
Nick says,
take your balls out of your purse in fucking get back on stage.

1203
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:44.590
All right,
good luck to Ya.
Alright.
Caught wife shoplifting.

1204
01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.680
Dear Bill
Building Saurus Rex.

1205
01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.573
Okay.
Uh,

1206
01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.840
my wife and I have been together for 13 years and married for about half that

1207
01:09:55.841 --> 01:10:00.580
time.
Basically we are best friends with a romantic relationship.
Congratulations.

1208
01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:03.370
Things that recently started getting even better for us.

1209
01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:08.470
All of a sudden I've noticed all these extra knickknacks around the house.
Um,

1210
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:12.820
I got my first job at a as a university professor and she got a job in

1211
01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:17.230
administration at the same university.
Oh my God.
She shoplifting.

1212
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.040
I believe our relationship is as strong as it is because I could trust her with

1213
01:10:21.041 --> 01:10:21.874
my life.

1214
01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.280
I think that just changed last night after getting home from the mall,

1215
01:10:27.281 --> 01:10:29.980
I found her taking makeup out of her purse,

1216
01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:35.080
the same makeup that she refused to buy because it was too expensive.

1217
01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.220
Her reaction told me I wasn't supposed to see that she had it.

1218
01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:42.340
I confronted her about the potential shoplifting.

1219
01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:47.380
The confrontation resulted in a long argument,

1220
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:52.740
one that swung from denial to anger in me to crying and then back to anger.

1221
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:56.680
She could never prove that she paid for it.

1222
01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:59.560
Giving her reaction and the circumstances.

1223
01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:02.590
I am as confident as one could be that she shoplifted.

1224
01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:05.440
Absolutely she would have just produced the receipt.

1225
01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:10.680
Trust me,
don't.
Trust is important to me.
Bill,

1226
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:15.810
my wife,
beautiful and she's constantly approached by men.

1227
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:20.310
I need to trust that she will stay loyal to our relationship,
her shoplifting,

1228
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:25.580
and then so brazenly lying to me about it puts everything into doubt for me.

1229
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.080
How is this risk worth

1230
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:35.420
her career or our relationship is shoplifting,
not that big a deal.

1231
01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.160
Could this also increased the likelihood that she is dishonest and other areas

1232
01:11:40.161 --> 01:11:44.630
of our relationship?
Am I crazy?
I will be listening to your advice,

1233
01:11:44.631 --> 01:11:47.990
by the way.
You killed it in Toronto.
Thank you.

1234
01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.460
Um,
ah dude.
I mean,
I don't know her,
you know,

1235
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:55.810
I think it's all of those things.
I think it,
it

1236
01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:00.800
might not be that big a deal or it could be the tip of an iceberg.

1237
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:03.890
I have no idea.
I have no idea.

1238
01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:07.760
But this is like the beginning of a great movie and I'm sorry that you're

1239
01:12:07.761 --> 01:12:08.594
starring in it.

1240
01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.280
Like this is like some Alfred Hitchcock Shit,
like rear window,

1241
01:12:16.281 --> 01:12:21.281
except you're in the apartment with the murderer potentially or

1242
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:27.710
you know,
it just sorta ends like that wore the world's anticlimactic.

1243
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:31.470
<v 4>Um,
I don't know.</v>

1244
01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:33.733
But

1245
01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:40.310
<v 3>yeah,
like do you pursue it?
Do you pursue it?</v>

1246
01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:43.760
Because I'm always about like,
when you feel shit like that,

1247
01:12:43.761 --> 01:12:48.080
sit down with them and just say,
look,
I'm not saying you're a bad person,

1248
01:12:48.081 --> 01:12:51.290
I'm just saying how what you did make makes me feel

1249
01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.950
all right.
And then tell her everything that you just said to me.

1250
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:03.260
<v 4>Um,
however,</v>

1251
01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.520
<v 3>you could also be pulling some threads here and,</v>

1252
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.090
and the whole thing comes crashing.
I don't,
fuck,
you know what?

1253
01:13:10.091 --> 01:13:14.020
Do you know what I would do?
Dude?
Fuck this.
You know something.

1254
01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.940
This is what women do when they're feeling something.
They fucking,

1255
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.200
they sit you down.

1256
01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.630
Fuck her tears fucker,
anger.
Fuck this.

1257
01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:29.640
You've got to validate what you're feeling.
You see all like,

1258
01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.180
this is what men do when they get in a relationship.
He t you treat your wife,

1259
01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:36.920
your girlfriend,
like a ticking time bomb.

1260
01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:38.893
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1261
01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.820
<v 3>Because they so much.
This guy's right.</v>

1262
01:13:42.821 --> 01:13:46.120
I do generalize a lot on the fucking podcast on it.
They fucking,

1263
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:52.850
they control the relationship with their emotions and then it's all subtly tied

1264
01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:55.413
to,

1265
01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.390
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1266
01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:00.830
<v 3>Special teams,
which is your fucking,
you know,
sex life.</v>

1267
01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.750
And if they're in a fucking bad mood about you,

1268
01:14:04.751 --> 01:14:07.390
you're not going to have any fucking sexist.
Fucking ridiculous.

1269
01:14:07.391 --> 01:14:11.270
But that's how it works.
So,
but fuck that dude it,

1270
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:14.470
this is what you're feeling and all of that shit.
You supposed to sit on it.

1271
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:17.800
Fuck that.
What do you think your wife would do?

1272
01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.420
You don't think she would do that?

1273
01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:22.150
You don't think she would start snooping on your Facebook?
I don't know.

1274
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.780
I'm not saying don't fucking snoop on the Facebook.
What I'm saying is,

1275
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:28.510
is what you should do is you should tell her,

1276
01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:29.760
<v 0>okay,</v>

1277
01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.970
<v 3>I don't know what the what to do here.
If you fucking do a stakeout,</v>

1278
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.540
if you start fucking,
oh man,
that's creepy.

1279
01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:41.640
Because then if you're fucking wrong,
no,
don't do that.

1280
01:14:41.641 --> 01:14:44.340
Because then if you fucking wrong and she catches you spying on her,

1281
01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.430
then then she has the upper and then,

1282
01:14:46.431 --> 01:14:51.270
then you become wrong because you caught her shoplifting.
Yeah.

1283
01:14:51.271 --> 01:14:56.270
I would sit her down and just say,
listen,
okay.
I'm not saying you're,

1284
01:14:56.610 --> 01:14:59.850
you're a bad person or anything.
I'm just telling you how I feel.

1285
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:02.760
Seeing you

1286
01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.270
shoplift and then lie to me about it and do it if she starts crying,

1287
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:11.850
but she gets angry.
Fuck that.

1288
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.910
She's being a fucking baby and she's manipulating it.

1289
01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.930
And then I would also sit there and I,
if she does that again,
I would say,

1290
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.330
and now you're in ability

1291
01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.790
in a mature way to handle what it is that I'm saying to you.

1292
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.740
And the letter get his fucking angry she wants to get.
And it's like,

1293
01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.820
be like you're getting angry at me.
I didn't steal anything.

1294
01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:43.030
I didn't lie about it.
Okay.

1295
01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:44.560
I'm just letting you know what the,

1296
01:15:44.561 --> 01:15:47.680
how this is making me feel and we can totally get past this.

1297
01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.220
If you're going to be an adult about this and sit down,

1298
01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:54.750
own up to what you did and talk me through this.
Oh,

1299
01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:59.380
is she going to get fucking mad at you?
And you know what?
Fuck her.
Okay.

1300
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:02.740
Cause this is what they'll do.
This is exact fucking thing that she do to you.

1301
01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:06.910
And I by no means fucking,
uh,

1302
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:11.680
superimposing all the fucking issues I have with women on you and your

1303
01:16:11.681 --> 01:16:14.920
relationship.
I absolutely am,
but that's what the fuck I would do.

1304
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.200
And you know something.
What else do you want from me?

1305
01:16:17.201 --> 01:16:19.630
That's all I can do is tell you what the fuck I would do that.

1306
01:16:19.631 --> 01:16:22.510
That is what I would do.
All right.

1307
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:24.370
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1308
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:26.680
<v 3>It wasn't fair for her to put you in that position.</v>

1309
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:30.760
And now for you to sit there and walking around carrying this fucking stress.

1310
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:34.840
So I would address it with her.
All right.
And there you go.

1311
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:40.000
That is the podcast and hour and 20 minutes.
Jesus,
you know,

1312
01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:41.200
I should do these once a month.

1313
01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:45.580
The fucking the Billy red rag podcast,
you know,

1314
01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:48.520
once a month.
I'm just going through my cycle.

1315
01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.930
There was a lot of fucking bitch moaning and complaining on this one,
but uh,

1316
01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:57.970
I just feel like for me,
um,
all right,
go fuck yourselves.

1317
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.800
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Alrighty.
That's it.
Oh,
by the way,

1318
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:06.110
congratulations to the Vegas fucking Golden Knights.
You know what I mean?

1319
01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.480
You beat my Bruins last night.
I saw we Soupon was in fucking net playing.

1320
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:13.520
God Damn Great.
I know he was in our farm system as pks brother.

1321
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:16.130
I forget his first name.
Um,

1322
01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.620
it's so fucking great and the fans are going crazy.
It's so awesome.

1323
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.050
Vegas is going to be a huge goddamn hit,

1324
01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:27.530
and I can't wait to go to a game up there and their colors and all about the

1325
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:32.210
college,
but I actually like that logo.
I didn't notice that.
Uh,
you know,

1326
01:17:32.211 --> 01:17:35.000
there's a little v there in the fucking helmet.
I think that's kind of cool.

1327
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:39.560
Fabius night helmet.
Oh,
that's clever.
All right,

1328
01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:41.390
let's go fuck yourself.
So I'll talk to you on Thursday.
