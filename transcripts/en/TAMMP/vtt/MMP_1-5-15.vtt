1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.660
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.100
June 5th,

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.400
the first Monday of the fuck in here.

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.970
I gave you an extra one that was for all the January,

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.050
sort of held the note.
Didn't like that.
I got fuck yourself,
whatever.

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.090
Another year.
Another year is started.
I gotta be honest with you.

7
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.960
It's still Sunday and I'm watching the tail end of the Dallas Detroit game.

8
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.900
I already know who wins.
There's only a minute 29 left.
And uh,

9
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.030
I was watching the game and real time and a Dallas score to go up 24 to 20.

10
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.300
So I ran upstairs to cut myself a little piece of apple pie,

11
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:48.590
like the fat fuck that I'm becoming quickly.
And uh,
I was in such a rush.

12
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.610
I took the fucking,
sorry for the echo.
Uh,

13
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.300
I'm downstairs and uh,
we don't have any enough furniture.

14
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.800
What do you want from me?
Okay.
It's a goal of mine at some point

15
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.050
in 2015 and once I'm done paying for all the fucking horse shit that I had done

16
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:09.470
down here,
once they get that out of the way,
maybe I can afford a fucking chair.

17
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.430
So anyways,
so I run up there.
All right.

18
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.240
Like a typical football Finn.
Okay.
Half a run,

19
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:21.410
half a wattle breathing through my mouth after three stairs.
Okay.

20
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.830
After I had the audacity to scream at the fucking TV,
you know?

21
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.850
Right.
Can't even run up 10 fucking stairs.
When did you know

22
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.580
first two steps?

23
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:40.360
I'm running like a 12 second 40 by the time I get to the fifth step,

24
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:45.010
I'm running like a 62nd 40 is just going downhill.
So get up there,

25
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.190
chop myself out a piece of Pie and I didn't even do that.

26
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.450
I took the lid off the thing,

27
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:54.451
the glass lid thing that our neighbors got us as a a house warming gift and I

28
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.980
wasn't even looking and I said it half on the counter,

29
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.320
half into air and it just shattered all over the place.

30
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.380
I got to tell you it sweeping it up.

31
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.020
I could tell how expensive it was.
You know,

32
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:11.110
people can tell you that something made out of glass is expensive,

33
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:15.070
but you don't realize how expensive it is until you break it and you're sweeping

34
00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:17.340
it up and you feel that weight and the dust pan like that.

35
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.000
That was some quality glass.

36
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.900
So I already know that the cowboys hang on to win this fucking game because a

37
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:28.781
buddy of mine,

38
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:33.781
Keith texted me and I'm what kills me,

39
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:37.330
the lovely Nia walking through.
Um,

40
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.460
and what kills me is,
uh,

41
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.270
is all it takes is one person to walk in the room.

42
00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:45.340
I completely lose my train of thought.
That's what kills me.

43
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.620
Now what the fuck kills me.
The fuck was I just talking about

44
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.690
Nia is this,
is this another add thing?
What?

45
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.280
Ah,

46
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.280
shut up easy as B a l l l B you are fucking Douche bag.

47
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.220
Why was he talking about God damn.
What the fuck was I talking to me?

48
00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.540
I don't walk in the room when I'm doing the podcast.
All right.

49
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.410
No I fucking I was,
I was,
I was going good there.

50
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.820
Oh Jesus.
All right.

51
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.000
Anyways cause it's the shredder retrace our steps.
All right.

52
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.230
I'm a winded fat guy and running up the stairs.
Cowboys a romp.
I break the lid.

53
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.090
This is some quality glass.

54
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.650
I go to fucking sweep it up and I ended with,

55
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:36.580
you know what kills me and I have no idea.
Seven.
Evidently it wasn't killing me,

56
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.370
so I was exaggerating.

57
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.220
I'm already fucking bitching in 2015 that's the heat.
Hey,

58
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.900
can you shut off the fucking eight please?
Yeah.

59
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.040
Can you shut up?
You shut off the heat please.

60
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.830
Thank you.
What does that sound?
I liked this.

61
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.620
Something about the echo.
I feel like I'm in a locker room.

62
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.960
It's fun.
It's fun for me.

63
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.980
And this is my podcast.
Hey,
you want a podcast without screaming?

64
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.290
Why don't you go fucking record one?

65
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.563
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

66
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.830
<v 0>He got looks could kill.</v>

67
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.810
You know what year you got to get out.
I got fucking add.
I start looking at you.

68
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:32.050
You gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
So I can do the fucking podcast.

69
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.370
Either grab a microphone or fucking paid it.

70
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.760
Jesus Christ.
I'm watching the end of the cowboys.
He had,
fuck,

71
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.790
let's just go with this city.
You know,

72
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:47.650
I love whenever a fucking NFL team wins a playoff game and then they cut to the

73
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:52.240
owners box and it's always like 12 fat white guys in j.
Crew pullover sweaters

74
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.500
or I'll fucking excited.
Woo.
You know,

75
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.760
you know they all got a fucking,
their assistants are all carry and forum.

76
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.980
Bring that fucking book.
She'll go over to the fucking yard if pieces,
shit,

77
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.730
maybe I'll actually tip you.
You work working for free some day.

78
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.910
You're going to work your way up in this jog your shower facility.

79
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.440
<v 1>Okay?</v>

80
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.420
<v 0>And they go down to the fucking,
where do you park a fucking boat down a yacht.</v>

81
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.980
Not done on that.
Down the fucking docs,
right?
You get down here,

82
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.510
okay.
They tell their wives that they got some whatever the fuck they say.

83
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:35.170
And then they go down there,
they got this side piece,
you know,

84
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.190
some fucking chick from Switzerland got her hair combed over and it face like

85
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:44.770
Aaliyah.
That chick from that movie with the rabbit that was a cartoon.

86
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:46.990
But talk to the fucking guy who looked like Burt young,

87
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.100
who framed Roger Rabbit there.
Right.
And what are they do?
Ah,

88
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.100
they fucking break it out.
The chicks just sit there.
This site.
All right.

89
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.740
Doing blow.
They're not gonna want to fuck.

90
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
And they all are again looking at Jesus.

91
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.380
Look at a guy in the red sweater that's all stress eating.

92
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.940
You know why that guy in the red sweater was that fat?
Not Cause he's gluttonous.

93
00:06:08.941 --> 00:06:13.530
Cause he had to deal with Jerry Jones wanting to draft fucking Johnny Manzel and

94
00:06:13.531 --> 00:06:16.530
he had a fucking talk him out of it,
you know?

95
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.010
And then he just had ice cream and short ribs for the rest of the fucking year

96
00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:24.510
after he dodged that bullet.
So anyways,
anyways,

97
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:26.790
let me shut off the fucking TV cause this is going to be too God damn

98
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:29.070
distracting.
Um,
by the way,

99
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:34.071
how many fucking football games are professional football players going to watch

100
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.660
where they see a fucking jerk off,

101
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.120
fumble the ball and then the defensive play a rather than just fallen on the

102
00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:46.980
fucking thing.
He's got to pick it up and try to be a God damn star.

103
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.810
And what happens?

104
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.590
Either you don't pick it up at fucking squirts away or you're fucking get it

105
00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:57.420
slapped out of your hands.
Unbelievable.
Anyways,
listen,

106
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.290
congratulations to the Dallas cowboys and to their fans and you know what to

107
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:04.171
Tony Romo,

108
00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:09.060
cause God knows he woulda got blamed for that entire fucking loss all day.

109
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.370
That guy,
man,
I don't know what it is about him.
You know he got,

110
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:16.360
Oh fuck the turtles got the smarts,
man.

111
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.470
That's what the fuck it is.
I remember one time a long time ago I had a ranch,

112
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.030
but for my fucking divorce,

113
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:25.120
you want to talk about big day fucked Dallas used to see when I played this

114
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:26.650
fucking Twat,
right?

115
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.280
God Damn Bitch sitting on the fucking porch all day.

116
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:34.150
Why don't you cut up the vegetables,
put them in a pile of shit.

117
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.300
She wouldn't do it.
You.
I tried.
Sweet talking to mark.

118
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.960
Shut the fuck up.
Lemme finish the story.
This is my story.

119
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.940
This is my fucking state.
That fucking Tony Romo.
Let me tell you right now.

120
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.030
He got a look in his eye.
Lakia pheasant,
but smells rat.

121
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.270
You know what I'm saying?
Little stupid southern expression.
Yeah.

122
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.040
I swear to God that boy,
that boy would fuck a cow.

123
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.500
He saw a road runner cone up to a goddamn snake balls.
And that's true too.

124
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.840
You can put that right.
So anyways,

125
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:09.260
Damon fucking with this guy for so goddamn long.

126
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:14.200
He said like a million fucking offensive coordinators.
The problem is,
is what?

127
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:18.080
What's his face?
Jerry Jones is an owner.
Okay.
He's,
he's got leaner.

128
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.040
You ever see a quarterback's got little happy feet in the pocket dancing around

129
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:25.190
or what we do door to door.
He can't feel the rush,
but he knows it's coming.

130
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.890
Got a bad feeling about this one man.
Right.

131
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:31.790
He's just fucking sit in there like that dude and platoon rather than plant his

132
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:34.580
fucking feet,
checking down the fucking receivers.
Right.

133
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.620
Like I would do if I was tall and had talent anyways.

134
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.070
He's got happy feet as a fucking owner.

135
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.090
Anybody come down the fucking pipe that's done anything in fucking football

136
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.610
that's gotten a little disco ball hanging over it.

137
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.230
He fucky he can't get enough of it.

138
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.970
He could not get enough of it if he would just relax and let coaches coach and

139
00:08:55.971 --> 00:08:58.040
the players play.
Okay.

140
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.920
Maybe slow down that elevator ride down to the fucking field.

141
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:04.880
I think Dallas would be a lot further down the road.
Okay.

142
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.980
You kind of,
you got to stop blaming your step son,
Tony Romo,

143
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.110
whatever.
Anyways,
congratulations to the Dallas cowboys,

144
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.480
to their fans and to that officiating crew that decided somewhere about four and

145
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:23.390
a half minutes to go like,
Hey,
what do you say?
Dallas wins this game.
Huh?

146
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.800
You got it like that on three but he brick bump.
How the fuck was that?

147
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:30.170
Not passing a ferrets guy.

148
00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:32.960
He's running down the field like he's out of gas in the middle of nowhere,

149
00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:37.280
flagging down a fucking car that's coming from the other direction.
Clear cut.

150
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.990
Case of fucking pass interference.
They don't.
They pick up the flag,

151
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.630
they pick it up.

152
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.810
The Dallas gets the fucking ball and there's more passive.
Ferris,

153
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.270
they don't pick up that flag.
I don't know.
I don't know.

154
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.450
I'm not saying it was fixed.
I would never say that.

155
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:58.250
I'm just saying it not with bay.
I'm a football,

156
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:02.300
but I just feel that there was a a,
you know,
it just wasn't,
you know,
come on.

157
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.130
Can you let the players when the fucking game,
I don't know.

158
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:08.600
What the fuck are you going to do anyways,

159
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.440
me and Paul Versey went round and fucking round this week about some sports

160
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:16.370
shit.
This will,
this is what,

161
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.550
this is the kind of guy when you listened to the Paul Versey effect,

162
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.510
the first effect podcast.
This is,

163
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.460
this is the level of intellect of this man.

164
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.470
I know he's going to get pissed at me.

165
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.560
I always do this cause then he trashes me on his podcast.
So here we go.

166
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.200
This is my side of the argument.
This is like,

167
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:38.120
listen to your parents argue through podcasting.
He fucking text me.

168
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.630
He said,

169
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.930
I think Cam Newton's going to have a big day today talking about when they're

170
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:46.630
playing the Arizona cardinals.
All right.
And this is the deal,
Paul verse,

171
00:10:46.631 --> 00:10:51.350
he said Cam Newton was going to be a beast in the NFL.
Classic Paul Versey pick,

172
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.250
he picks this fucking guy who nobody's ever heard of.

173
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.740
Just like an uh,
12th round pick.
I mean practically off the fucking board.

174
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.430
And he just saw something in this guy.
I don't know what it was.

175
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.320
I don't know if it was the national championship and the Heisman trophy.

176
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.340
I don't know what tipped him off to the fact that he thought that this guy was

177
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:15.140
going to be a good player.
But Paul for z,

178
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.770
he sees things and this is what he would

179
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.060
<v 2>say.
Well,
you know a lot,
a lot of fucking Heisman trophy winners don't pan out.</v>

180
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.130
<v 0>No easy.
Eish um,
anyways,
why don't you pick the second rounder?</v>

181
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.650
Who's going to pan out
instead of hitching your,

182
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.190
your fucking wagon to this guy who's got his God damn ear staple to the side of

183
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:38.760
his fucking head.
All right.
So when,
anyways,
the nerve of me,

184
00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:42.420
the way I look to criticize,
that guy looks like a superman,
right?
Anyways,

185
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.970
so I put on the fucking game and lo and behold,
the fucking Arizona cardinals,

186
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.230
they got a third string quarterback in there.
May God bless him,

187
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.530
but the guy through a screen pass and he fell down.

188
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.200
He look like me after a couple of beers.
Right?

189
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.920
Of course he's going to have a big fucking day.

190
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

191
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.300
<v 0>I know Arizona has a good defense.
All right.
Carolina fans fucking relax.</v>

192
00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:08.870
All right.

193
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.870
But when the opposing team's fucking Qb is falling down because he threw the

194
00:12:14.091 --> 00:12:17.900
football,
you got to know there's going to be a lot of three and outs.

195
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.050
At which point Arizona's defense is going to tire out.

196
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.170
At which point Kalorama Caroline is going to have their way with them

197
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.913
<v 4>and I'll tell you,</v>

198
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.890
<v 0>yeah,
she don't flip while week.
Um,
anyways,</v>

199
00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:38.280
I didn't actually watch a lot of,
I didn't watch a lot of sports,
but a verse,

200
00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:40.930
he was driving me up the,
this is what,
this is what he did.
Granny.

201
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:45.270
He was fucking boozing it up last night,
but he fucking texted me and he's,

202
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.770
and know I trashed him about how he said that Babe Ruth is the greatest fucking

203
00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:51.150
baseball player of all time,

204
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.180
which is absolutely fucking ridiculous and fuck all you baseball historians.

205
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.280
Okay?
Who are going to take out your reams and reams of fucking stats.

206
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.900
All right.
Is He is the fucking news.

207
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.550
I was just thinking what's his face in a,
in a,

208
00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:14.940
what the fuck does not desperado what's it called?
Reservoir dogs.

209
00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.800
Here's the news.
Looks like,
say a fucking hot car loan up there.

210
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.570
Um,
Chris Penn,
one of my favorites of all time.
This man,

211
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:27.240
this man who did his time,
he did it like a man.

212
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.130
It's just going to disappear
out of the fucking blue,

213
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.080
um,
to rip us off fucker.

214
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.460
And I talked my way out of it and I don't remember what the fuck I was just

215
00:13:41.461 --> 00:13:42.294
saying.

216
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:43.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

217
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.170
<v 0>Oh Jesus Christ.
The fuck was I oversee.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

218
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.280
Our key if all you fucking historians,
okay,

219
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.390
if your guy played when only white guys were allowed to play,

220
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.690
take 30% of those stats and his rock says turn it up sideways and shelve it

221
00:14:05.161 --> 00:14:10.150
straight up
cause they don't fucking count.

222
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.420
Okay,
they don't fucking count

223
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.900
Babe Ruth fucking guys getting shit faced.

224
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.110
Bang and hawkers the night before the game.
Then he goes out,

225
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:26.580
throws a no hitter and hits for fucking home runs in the same game though.

226
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:30.860
That's like a beer league.
You know what I mean?

227
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.130
<v 3>Okay,</v>

228
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.090
<v 0>give me a fucking break.</v>

229
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.650
Don't you think it's weird that that guy played a hundred fucking years ago and

230
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:39.880
since he played,

231
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:45.040
there's never been another guy who could even remotely come close to doing that

232
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.560
to winning 20 games in a season and hitting 50 fucking home runs.

233
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.610
<v 3>Bo Jackson</v>

234
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.540
<v 0>couldn't even do that and that guy is arguably a hall of fame athlete in two</v>

235
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:59.510
different professional sports.
He couldn't even fucking do that.

236
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.580
You put them on the mound,
he would've got fucking shelter.

237
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.720
Gimme a fucking brick is another thing too.

238
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.150
I don't know if you guys have noticed this shit,

239
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.390
but once they let quote unquote the rest of everybody play,

240
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:18.270
did you notice what happened to the white population and everything but hockey?

241
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.330
It fucking plummeted.
Plummeted.

242
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.953
All right,

243
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.270
but when Babe Ruth played those fucking guys stayed in the league.

244
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.780
You had me playing fucking shortstop.
Hey,
no bad I Shane,

245
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.210
he's now batter.
Listen,

246
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.120
I'm not saying Babe Ruth wouldn't hit fucking six.
I'll give him 600 home runs.

247
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.020
Okay?
I'm not giving them over 700 I'm not fucking doing it.

248
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.380
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

249
00:15:50.381 --> 00:15:54.730
He maybe could have taken Marianna Rivera deep,
but not every fucking time.

250
00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:01.140
Jesus fucking Christ.
Give me a fucking break.

251
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.130
What a standup comedy was only white guys.

252
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.660
You know Richard Pryor,
Bill Cosby,

253
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.320
fucking day.
Eddie Murphy,
just all of those guys.

254
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.830
All of them out the fucking window.
Gimme a fucking,

255
00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:23.190
it's the stupidest fucking argument I've ever heard in my fucking life.

256
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.340
And then to act like when you actually let everybody fucking play that the

257
00:16:26.341 --> 00:16:30.890
competition isn't way more intense,
way more fucking intense.

258
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.650
And to sit there and say like,
dude,

259
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.980
the guys on base percentage shut the fuck up.

260
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.990
Shut the,
I didn't want to.
I don't,
I don't even want to fucking hear,
dude.

261
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.010
I'll tell you.
And that goes for everybody.

262
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.660
I'm not just picking on white guys here.

263
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.500
Fucking fuck wilt Chamberlain's hundred points in a game.
All right?

264
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.620
I Find Koby Bryant scoring over 80 points like two,

265
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:57.370
three fucking years ago was way more impressive than scoring a hundred points.

266
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.610
You know Dunkin on Bob Cousy,
not saying that he's not a fucking hall of Famer,

267
00:17:03.611 --> 00:17:07.180
but I'm just saying,
come on,
give me a fucking break.

268
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.610
Ah,
Jesus.
I'm on a fucking tie right here.

269
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.870
And you also kills me is first he calls me up.
He goes,
Yo.
He goes,
Yannis Pappas.

270
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:17.720
I don't know if you guys ever seen him.
He's absolutely fucking hilarious.
Okay.

271
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:18.741
He said,

272
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:23.390
Yannis Pappas is destroying your Babe Ruth argument right now you're getting

273
00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:26.990
killed by Yannis Pappas,
right?
Which is fucking hilarious to me.
It's like,
Paul,

274
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.110
how am I getting killed?
I'm not there to fucking,
I'm not there to hear it.

275
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.260
I'm not there to defend myself.
This guy's out there.
He's punching at the air.

276
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.710
Okay.
This is the thing about a character like Paul Versey and Yannis Pappas,

277
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.370
alright?
These fresh faced a little kids,
they were born in the late seventies,

278
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:48.371
early fucking eighties and they don't know a fucking thing that happened before

279
00:17:48.421 --> 00:17:52.010
the first Bush administration.
They now no shit.

280
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:57.020
They're the video game generation.
That Robin one app to some fucking porn site.

281
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.180
They grew up with a screen in their face.

282
00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.813
<v 1>Okay?</v>

283
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.810
<v 0>I'm telling you,
go out to one of this show,</v>

284
00:18:02.811 --> 00:18:05.330
see the look in their eye twitching up there.

285
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.950
Um,
this is what I was saying at first,
whenever verse,

286
00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.680
he starts to get annoying me and I know it's his age.
I just say,
Paul,

287
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:16.491
why don't you do me a favor?

288
00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:19.730
Why don't you go over there and go get yourself a malt and sit down and think

289
00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:24.050
about what you said.
Okay.
And I actually texted him,
told them to do that.

290
00:18:24.051 --> 00:18:27.410
And I said,
while you're at it,
why don't you go fucking by Yannis Pappas?
One,
two.

291
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.490
And if either one of you are listening to this clip the next time I am in New

292

York,

Okay,

293
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.330
We'll have a couple,
two or three and I will listen to your fucking argument.

294
00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:46.331
I want you to explain to me how a man who never had to face the Pedro Martinez

295
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:51.570
back then,
the Marianna Rivera,
the Josh Gibbs,

296
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:56.500
all of those guys off the fucking table.
Jesus Christ.

297
00:18:56.501 --> 00:19:00.670
It's like a fucking five on three.
The whole God damn game.
You scored a goal.

298
00:19:00.671 --> 00:19:03.280
Oh my God,
that's impressive.
The fucking guy.

299
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.450
He pitched no hitters and hit 50 home runs.
I mean,
give me a fucking break.

300
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.620
He's a fat fuck.
That's what kills me.
You'll get no idea,

301
00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.970
dude is fucking hand eye coordination.
Oh my God.

302
00:19:15.971 --> 00:19:17.560
Get the fuck Outta here.

303
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.010
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

304
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.380
<v 0>I mean,
look,
look at the fucking 1920s</v>

305
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.130
they didn't even know how to have sound in a movie yet
and then when they did,

306
00:19:30.131 --> 00:19:34.930
everybody's like,
man,
why I Yada.
That was acting.
If people got awards for that.

307
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:36.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

308
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.080
<v 0>He played baseball during that fucking time.
Okay.
Let me tell you something.</v>

309
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:42.500
If you played baseball when you're fucking card,

310
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.490
your baseball card was in a cigar box.
Go Fuck Yourself,
okay?

311
00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:48.920
I'm not saying that you couldn't play today.
Okay?

312
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.810
But take 30% of waste that's turn them up sideways and shove them up.

313
00:19:53.811 --> 00:19:57.740
You fucking candy as cause I don't want to fucking hear it.
All right.

314
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.550
Paul Versey talking about his hand eye coordination.

315
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.720
Pullovers he's also the fucking guy who told me Seabiscuit was an unbelievable

316
00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:07.910
athlete.
A fucking horse.

317
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.660
And you know why you said that?
Because somebody got an ESPN.
Paul,

318
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:15.030
you got to get on this podcast because I'm actually getting guilty.

319
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:16.530
I'm fucking trash and you so bad,

320
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.910
but I'm not for the simple fact that you said somebody was killing me when I

321
00:20:20.911 --> 00:20:25.410
wasn't even there to be killed.
Who knows?
Yanis might kill me.
Who knows?
He might.

322
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.040
You know if he's got that ethnic name,
who the fool the fuck knows.

323
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.610
He knows how to make some fucking buckle voc by fucking hand.

324
00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:34.170
Maybe he knows some shit about baseball.

325
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:39.171
I would love to have either one of you fresh faced kids convinced me how without

326
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:42.900
a doubt,
Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player both fucking time.

327
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:45.930
And I'll tell you right now,
I don't want her to fucking word about those stats.

328
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.450

333
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.160

Oh God.

334
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.820
All right.
Uh,

[inaudible] 90%.

369
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.930
That's the percent of your life that you're going to be in your underwear there.

370
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.940
Unless you're Matthew mcconaughey and it's probably 10%.
Um,

371
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.430
and that underwear gets old fast.

372
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.850
You know that feeling of putting on old saggy underwear,
you know,

373
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.170
if your underwear quits,

374
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:37.000
you balls are going to quit and then you gotta go to work.

375
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:38.100
And what are they going to give you half?

376
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.540
They're going to give you another nickel an hour and tell you to sit down and

377
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:43.810
shut your face.
You need to know the feeling of victory.

378
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.950
And that feeling is great.
Fitting underwear that grabs you balls.

379
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.740
Let them know who's boss,
but let them also know that hey,

380
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.460
you're in for a nice ride.
It's two times softer than cotton,

381
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.250
but you guys know that.
Can you do that math in your head?

382
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.800
You need to know about me.
Undies me undies.
Biondi is,

383
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.020
is the most comfortable underwear you'll ever wear.

384
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.340
And it's insane how good they make you feel.
You're gonna walk down the street.

385
00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:11.420
God dammit.
I feel good.
Woo.
They fit perfectly.

386
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.470
They don't ride up on you and they literally pull moisture away from your skin.

387
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:19.580
See a stakes stay cool.
Roast,
personalize.

388
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.940
Pick one.
Oh,
I'm supposed to.
I'm supposed to pick one here.

389
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:26.810
I actually wore a pair.
They're very nice.
Slightly a feminist,
but very nice.

390
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.490
I have mine on right now.
Do I?
Let me see.
No,
I don't.

391
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.580
Maybe that's why I'm so grumpy.
I bet if I had me undies,

392
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:38.720
I think Babe Ruth was the greatest player of all time.
Let's see.

393
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:41.600
I can't even tell you how great I feel when I'm staying cool and comfortable

394
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:44.540
down there all day.
I'll just tell you why that put them on.
They feel good.

395
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.770
They know right up my ass.
They hold my balls.
Nice sand.

396
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.310
I feel like I'm nicer to my wife.
How's that?
Was that personal enough?
Uh,

397
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:55.400
they have cool stars for both men and women and they all look great.
Oh,

398
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.690
they got it for women to me,
Hyundai's me undies.
No more clear me clam.

399
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.050
Um,
check out the photos yourself.
Me undies,
dotcom.

400
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.830
This quality would typically retail for two times the me on the price.

401
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.750
Okay?
If that's what you say,
no retail middleman means more.
Same as to you here,

402
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:12.381

Set your balls up for the year when they arrive.
Throw out your old once,

413
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.540
right?
Or wash him and give him to a brave homeless person and that's it.

414

All right.
Just go to [inaudible] dot com slash burn does that,

415
00:25:57.561 --> 00:26:01.850

Anyways,

416
00:26:01.851 --> 00:26:03.340
dollar shave club.
Everybody's last one.

417
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.060
I'll read here and then I'll get back to the podcast.

418
00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:08.810
Can summer tell me when raised has got so damn expensive.
Yeah,
I can.

419
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:11.780
My whole fucking life.
It's been brutal.
A brutal rip off.

420
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:16.160
I'd been bitching about this since I started shaving back in the late eighties

421
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.010
anyways,
have I been asleep for 20 years?

422
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:24.350
I was in a store the other day and one pack of razors is now 20 bucks.
One pack.

423
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:29.030
That's crazy,
but hey,
sometimes they give you a free gift when you buy.

424
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.200

Let's get back to the podcast here.
Um,
all right.

451
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.350
Couple of things.
Uh,
I got to give a shout out to Stuart Scott.
Everybody,

452
00:27:59.351 --> 00:28:00.700
man,
that guy,
uh,

453
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.760
one of the absolute legends of ESPN and watching that guy over the years as he

454
00:28:06.311 --> 00:28:11.080
was fighting cancer,
uh,
just the way he went after it.
Man,
I really,
I mean,

455
00:28:11.081 --> 00:28:12.850
I hope I never get it,
but if I ever do,

456
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.880
I hope I go at it the way that guy did it because,
uh,

457
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.150
that guy went out like a man.
That's all I'm going to say,
Stuart.

458
00:28:19.151 --> 00:28:22.180
Scott going to miss you.
Um,
anyways,

459
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.530
and then I got some good news is a nick Depaulo,

a comedian that everybody should be,

461
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.690
And every time they make those dumb fucking lists,
okay,
who's happening?

462
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.630
Who's now?
Who's this?
Who's that comedy?

463
00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:42.130
Nick Depaulo should be on that fucking list.
I don't care how short that list is.

464
00:28:42.131 --> 00:28:42.521
This guy,

465
00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:46.270
he's a comic's comic and I'm actually excited if you've never heard of the guy,

473
00:29:11.471 --> 00:29:14.390
O.
L.
O.
Nick Depaulo.
Uh,

474
00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.820
absolutely fucking fearless.

475
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.140
And uh,
I did a tour with them a long time ago.

476
00:29:23.141 --> 00:29:27.500
I told this story when I did nick and rd show a long time ago.
I did.
Um,

477
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.350
I had done the,
uh,
the Montreal comedy festival and the Montreal Comedy Festival.

478
00:29:32.351 --> 00:29:33.160
Ha.
Um,

479
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.160
just for laughs is like huge up in Canada,

480
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.350
but you know,
people are starting,
get to know him down here,

481
00:29:42.351 --> 00:29:45.440
but they had no idea who they were like 10 years ago when I went on this fucking

482
00:29:45.441 --> 00:29:49.610
tour and um,
it was a sick taught tools.
Nick Depalo,

483
00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.650
me,
Greg Geraldo,
rest his soul.
Uh,
Tom,
Papa,

484
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.720
Gary Gulman,
who else was on it?
I mean it was just,

485
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.240
it was just to kill a bunch of comics.
All great guys,

486
00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:03.130
everybody having a good time.
And uh,

487
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:07.180
I used to watch nick when nick would go out there.
All of a sudden he's like,

488
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:10.240
his chin were dropped down to his chest and he wants to be looking through his

489
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:14.460
eyebrows and he would just be going back and forth looking through the crowd all

490
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.520
the way from stage,
right.

491
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.840
Slowly all the way to stage left stage left slowly back,

492
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:21.100
all the way over to stage.
Right.

493
00:30:21.101 --> 00:30:24.540
I used to watch them do this every fucking night as he's telling these killer

494
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:28.240
jokes.
I'm like,
what the fuck is he doing?
What he's backstage is his head is,

495
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:30.670
he's,
you know,
he's got level flight here.
He goes out there,

496
00:30:30.671 --> 00:30:32.590
he's knows down what the fuck is going on.
Right.

497
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.070
And I finally realized what it was because of material he did,

498
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.210
inevitably somebody was going to scream out at him.

499
00:30:40.211 --> 00:30:44.050
So what he was doing was he was ducking down,
he was shielding his face,

500
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.190
his eyes from the stage light so he could see who said what.

501
00:30:48.191 --> 00:30:50.860
So he could tear him a new fucking asshole,
I think I said on already.

502
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:54.160
So he was like a security camera,
just go and back and forth.

503
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:59.410
He's one of my favorite comics of all time and he's a great fucking guy.

504
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.970
Um,
so anyways,
when I,
when I do the Patrice O'Neal benefit next month,

505
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.990
I'm going to try to get him on and he's out here.
I know we did Joe Rogan's,

506
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:12.220
he did Adam Corollas and uh,
I think he did Jay Morris podcast to a,

507
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.320
was trying to set something up with me,
but he was all,

508
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.620
it was all backed up or whatever.
It just didn't work out between us.

509
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:21.070
So that sucks for me,
uh,
and my podcast and my listeners,

510
00:31:21.071 --> 00:31:24.820
but I promise you I'm going to get him on probably in the next month.

511
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:29.200
I got to make it happen.
Um,
if as it would be an honor to have him on,

512
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:34.080
he's just fucking awesome.
So anyways,
moving on.
Um,

513
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.630
all right,

514
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:39.630
well I went to another Rosebowl everybody and I think I'm just now starting to

515
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:43.420
recover.
First of all,
what a fucking game.
I um,

516
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.500
just like the rose bowls are already unbelievable,

517
00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:52.501
but to add that whole playoff fucking atmosphere to it was just insane.

518
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.403
And uh,

519
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.760
this year being and all the guys we got over there,

520
00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.940
we were so fucking organized this year.
We,

521
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.150
we had,
we had fucking everything.

522
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.950
We had fucking everything,
food,
booze,

523
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.293
other stuff.

524
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:20.350
Jason Law had put on a display of tailgate cooking that it was,

525
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:27.290
he had a career year.
That's what we was saying.
He had a breakout.

526
00:32:27.291 --> 00:32:31.130
It was just fucking on.
It was the best breakfast sandwich I ever had.

527
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.920
Then he made these ribs that were unbelievable.

528
00:32:33.921 --> 00:32:37.340
Then we went to the game and at the end of the game it was freezing out by then

529
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.900
and we were smart as how smart we were.

530
00:32:38.901 --> 00:32:43.901
We up quarter would and one of the grills we turn into just like a firepit and

531
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.880
everybody else who's waiting for the traffic,
every ball,

532
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:50.120
these people will come in and gathering around our little fire going,

533
00:32:50.121 --> 00:32:52.100
you guys are smart.
Oh this is really smart.

534
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.980
What I left out is we brought everything except fire.

535
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.510
We forgot to bring a lighter.

536
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.270
They were bringing the grills and they were bringing the charcoal.

537
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:01.520
So I assumed that they were going to bring the fucking lighter.

538
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:04.490
And I brought the Lennar every year.
So I guess that one was one was on me.

539
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:08.460
I don't know what,
but other than that it was a,
uh,

540
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.500
it was another amazing time.
And um,

541
00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.690
it was fucking hilarious.
We basically,
we get into the game,

542
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.840
got in on time because it's a fucking playoff game.
Right.

543
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.960
And there was so many people getting tickets that I couldn't get four together.

544
00:33:23.961 --> 00:33:28.370
I got two and two,
so we were like couple rows,
two,
three rows in front of a Bart,

545
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:31.520
nick and La head.
And we're sitting there,
you know,
and I'm pretty,

546
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.710
I'm not as bad as I was last year,
but I was fucking,
uh,
I was feeling no plane.

547
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.880
All right.
I was definitely more than dehydrated at that point.

548
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And all of a sudden I see security walking out with Jason Law head and there's

549
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:47.991
no,

550
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:52.790
Joe Botnick in Jay is looking at over at me with his hands,

551
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.000
like up like what the fuck?
And he's yelling at me and I'm going,

552
00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.520
Jay Jay where they take it and I'm in like,

553
00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:01.700
I'm in the middle of this fucking row.
There's like 30 people on one side,

554
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:06.110
30 and the other,
this old school stadium,
right.
Total fucking fire hazard.
Right.

555
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.680
I'm like,
Jay,
where are you?
Go Jay.
And he's fucking yell at me.
I can't hear.

556
00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.030
And that Jay whisking them out so fast.
There's nothing I could do.

557
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.970
Other than that,
I just keep going with Jay j

558
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.300
plus looking at me like,
what the fuck turns out?

559
00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.850
Uh,
I don't know.
Bart.
Nick was outside.

560
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:30.950
He was in the stadium,
but outside the stands,

561
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:35.951
I guess he had sat down or something and nodded off and when he came to there

562
00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:40.250
was like fucking 20 cops surrounded him because he's such a big guy.

563
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.530
I thought they were like,
they were like,
whether this guy starts swinging,

564
00:34:42.531 --> 00:34:46.190
we're fucked.
And they went down there and they told,

565
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.130
I guess they looked at his ticket and they went up to get Jason.

566
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:51.590
That's what they did and they said,
we got to,
he's been overserved,

567
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:56.890
which is the understatement for all of us for 2015 and a la had,

568
00:34:57.561 --> 00:34:58.251
to his credit,

569
00:34:58.251 --> 00:35:02.180
the only thing he did better than cooking was talk his way out of that.

570
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.320
He just kept going.
I come on,
look at the guy,
he,
he's,
he's a teddy bear.

571
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.470
He's like,
he's not,
he's not hurting anybody.
He's going to go up to and sit down.

572
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:10.850
He's going to be any of that.
He's at,

573
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:14.660
he just kept saying he's a teddy bear and Joe was just looking at,

574
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.680
hey teddy bear and next thing you know they fucking let them in fucking law.

575
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.730
Had the politician gets him to his seat,

576
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:31.750
he sits in his seat and then promptly fucking passes out and some lady behind

577
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:35.420
law head goes,
hey,
you're going to have to get him outta here.

578
00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:40.620
And Jay just at him and said,
hey,
come on.
He's not her name,

579
00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:43.900
but he's a teddy bear.
Okay,
listen.
And she fucking job back at him.

580
00:35:43.901 --> 00:35:48.400
And Jay was just like,
listen,
if I tell you what,
if you will just watch the game,

581
00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.430
you're not even going to see them.
Okay.
I mean,

582
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.800
I can wake him up if you want me to.
I'll wake him up.

583
00:35:53.801 --> 00:35:55.870
I don't think you're gonna like it,
but I can't wake him up.

584
00:35:55.871 --> 00:36:00.040
And people just started laughing and it was over and we had a wonderful time.

585
00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:04.000
I'm seeing two of the top college football programs play each other.

586
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.230
It's a hell of a game through two and a half quarters.
And then,
uh,
Oregon.

587
00:36:08.231 --> 00:36:13.231
I got to give a shout out to the ducks just for shutting up the Fsu band that I

588
00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:16.720
didn't have to hear it,
that,
that fucking Tomahawk Chop again.
And I,
I,
dude,

589
00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.830
I fucking called it that band knows three songs,

590
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:24.610
they know the school song,
they play something else and then everything else is

591
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.303
<v 5>hello</v>

592
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.540
<v 0>the whole fucking game.
And um,
it was,</v>

593
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.330
I mean,
I don't know,
I would like to see a little bit of a closer game,
but uh,

594
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.100
I really enjoyed,
uh,
the fact that they shut that band up.
Nothing against Fsu.

595
00:36:39.101 --> 00:36:42.070
I actually really liked the Seminoles and I've always loved that program.
But um,

596
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.140
somewhere along the line that Tom lock chopped just fucking,

597
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.760
it would be like if at the Red Sox,
like,
you know,
awful.
It is when they sync.

598
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:54.570
Sweet Caroline,
just imagine a fake did that between every fucking inning.
I mean,

599
00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.030
you'd want to kill yourself,
right?
If you want any sort of a human being.

600
00:36:57.031 --> 00:37:00.060
And that includes being a red sox fan because I want to jump off the fucking

601
00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:03.930
monster when I hear that fucking song.
Just once,
when you look at around him,

602
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.500
fucking women putting their head on the fucking guys shoulder,
it's just like,

603
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.170
uh Huh.
I Dunno.
Maybe I dunno.

604
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.690
Maybe I should be a little more positive about stash.
Shit like that.

605
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:19.090
I have no idea.
Um,
what else?
So it's a new year.
Do I have any

606
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.810
new year's resolutions?
Uh,
yeah.
I'm actually gonna try.

607
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:26.800
It's fucking hilarious with this podcast.

608
00:37:26.801 --> 00:37:29.350
I'm going to try to lose my shit a little bit less.

609
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:31.010
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

610
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:35.010
<v 0>Especially in when I drive.
I um,</v>

611
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.840
you know what really,
I know this is an old comedy bit here,

612
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:42.600
but what really fucking bothers me.
This,
this is the,
um,
you know,

613
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.270
rather than just saying straight across the board,
I'm going to lose,

614
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.990
I'm going to,
I'm going to stop losing my shit when I drive.
I'm just picking,

615
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.130
picking moments.

616
00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:52.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

617
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.130
<v 0>Like,
you know what I'm,
I'm,</v>

618
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:57.660
I'm not going to flip out about anymore is when there's traffic on the highway

619
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.500
and that person in front of you leaves like a four card gap in front of them.

620
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.580
I'm just pausing right now for anybody who just wanted to go like,
oh,

621
00:38:06.581 --> 00:38:09.970
I fucking hate that guy.
I know.
I fucking hate that guy too.

622
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.700
We all hate that fucking guy.
Unless you are that guy.

623
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:18.330
Is anybody that guy who listens to this podcast and for the sanity of the other

624
00:38:19.811 --> 00:38:21.700
98% of the people on the planet,

625
00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.590
can you please explain your fucking rationale?

626
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.130
100 I could lose my shit.
Can you please explain

627
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.070
your mindset as to why you feel that you have to leave that big of a gap?

628
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:37.970
You know,

629
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.970
and I was actually sitting behind this guy and I was starting to lose my shit

630
00:38:40.971 --> 00:38:45.830
and go,
I'm not gonna lose my shit.
And I just sat in my head,
this guy it.

631
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.350
Rather than saying he's texting,
rather than saying he's a moron,

632
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.830
I just said this guy has gotten into a major accident and he broke his fucking

633
00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:55.950
hip it,
and he doesn't want it to have,
but again,
so he's letting other people go,

634
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.873
<v 1>okay,</v>

635
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.310
<v 0>just fucking,
and I hate that whole mentality.
Like why?
I mean,
what,</v>

636
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.600
what are we actually saving in the end of the day?
I mean,
what's,

637
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.320
what's another car length?
You know what it is?
It's,
it's soothing.

638
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:11.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

639
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:13.050
<v 0>It's a,</v>

640
00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:17.160
it's a cold drink of water on a hot summer's day just to move another fucking

641
00:39:17.161 --> 00:39:20.630
foot.
All right.
Can you know what,
that's what I do.
Isn't any anybody out there,

642
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.250
one of those fucking people.
Can you explain?

643
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:26.130
Please explain to me why you do that.
Maybe if I know why you do that,

644
00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:31.110
then I can actually understand you more as a person and then I won't be beside

645
00:39:31.111 --> 00:39:33.480
myself cause you don't see the world the way I do.
How about that?

646
00:39:33.481 --> 00:39:36.060
Is that more mature?
And while we're at it,

647
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.920
people out here in la who ride bicycles in those clusters of 20 fucking people,

648
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.620
like you're having a bike race that nobody else wants.

649
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.750
Now I'm nobody else knows about.

650
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.080
Why do you feel that you're allowed to ride out in the road like that?

651
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:50.980
I've asked cops.

652
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:55.981
You're not allowed to do that or why do you ride side by side the two of you so

653
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:59.560
you can shoot the shit and you're slowing people down behind you.

654
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.931
I'm just asking,

655
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:05.260
don't you feel it's a little hypocritical if you want the fucking car to share

656
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:09.310
the road that you don't share the fucking road.
And while we're at it,

657
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:11.890
why are you dressed up with like sponsors on you?

658
00:40:11.891 --> 00:40:15.400
Like anybody's paying you to ride that.
Fuck it.
That Jesus Christ.

659
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.000
It goes to temper.
All right,
let's get to some questions here for the week.
Um,

660
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.800
the rose bowl,
everybody.
Oh Dude,
I'll tell you right now,

661
00:40:23.801 --> 00:40:26.500
if you're gonna pick a beer to start the day with,
I'm telling you,

662
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.250
Miller high life,
uh,
in,
uh,
in the,
you got to get it in the bottle.

663
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.190
Oh my God,
the sun's just coming up.

664
00:40:33.191 --> 00:40:36.610
We've got the seven Oh four in the fucking morning.
It was freezing cold out.

665
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.850
There was a frost on the fairways.
I'm telling you guys,

666
00:40:39.851 --> 00:40:42.610
you've got to fucking do this.
Okay?
You don't got to go to the Rose Bowl.

667
00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:44.230
Fucking pick something,

668
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.310
<v 1>okay.</v>

669
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.310
<v 0>That you and all you had dumb guy friends do,</v>

670
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:50.980
are you and all your dumb fucking women friends.
Just,

671
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:55.240
you gotta have that one thing you do every year.
You got to have that.

672
00:40:55.241 --> 00:40:57.870
I don't give a fuck what kind of responsibility you got out.

673
00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.970
You got to have that one fucking thing.
So anyways,
we got to,

674
00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:02.980
the frost was on the fucking fairways.

675
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:04.430
<v 1>Okay?</v>

676
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.100
<v 0>I actually said this year when I got out,
I said,
hey guys,
guys,
got to go.</v>

677
00:41:07.101 --> 00:41:09.980
Take this in right here.
This is the best part of the tailgate.

678
00:41:09.981 --> 00:41:10.880
It's the beginning.

679
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

680
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.820
<v 0>And this time tomorrow,
you're going to wish that this fucking moment,</v>

681
00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.040
actually no,
because he'd be too hung over.
Three days later,

682
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.960
when you get all the poison out of your system,

683
00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:21.970
you're going to be fucking longing for that feeling.

684
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.260
Do we get out of that truck ear to ear,
fucking grins.

685
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:28.563
<v 1>And then</v>

686
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.720
<v 0>Bart,
it's got this thing that he yells out to everybody to the entire lot.</v>

687
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.610
Um,
I don't want to say what it is cause he yells,
it's so fucking loud.

688
00:41:38.611 --> 00:41:40.980
And so far,
nobody's ever found our fucking tailgate,

689
00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:44.620
which has been great because we make a spectacle of ourselves.
Um,

690
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.370
you got to do it.
So anyways,
the Rosebowl let's,
let's read this thing here.

691
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.400
Dear Billy football,

696

Jesus bill.
Um,

698
00:42:12.721 --> 00:42:15.450
that makes me look good with the people I'm in business with over there and

699
00:42:15.451 --> 00:42:19.650
Netflix.
So a,

I really appreciate it.
All right.

700
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.220
Um,
anyways.
Anyways,
here we go.
Anyway,

701
00:42:23.221 --> 00:42:26.040
I had a question about your Rosebowl outing last weekend.

702
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:31.070
The game itself was great from that opening Oregon drive when Mary Yada,

703
00:42:31.441 --> 00:42:34.620
I hope that's how you say his name.
I didn't,
it's two Heisman trophy winners.

704
00:42:34.621 --> 00:42:39.600
I don't even know their fucking names.
I was so busy this year.
I was so hammered.

705
00:42:39.601 --> 00:42:43.380
I even had a fucking program.
I had no idea.
Uh,

706
00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:48.410
Mary Yada pitched it to the guy who somersaulted to the one yard line f and

707
00:42:48.481 --> 00:42:52.590
later completed the two point conversion.
All that was great in the beginning,
uh,

708
00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:57.650
to famous James flopping around fumbling for an Oregon touchdown late in the

709
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.830
third.
It was just a great game.
And I was thirdly jealous you were there.

710
00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.820
You're obviously an Oregon ducks fan.
Uh,
my question is,

711
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.770
can you share with us a couple of your favorite moments from this year as

712
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.470
Roosevelt?
I kind of did that,
but there's probably some more.
I'm sure you had.

713
00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.150
You in the goon squad.

714
00:43:15.151 --> 00:43:20.151
You roll around with a gun in some funny situations of conflicts.

715
00:43:20.701 --> 00:43:24.570
Ps,
I saw la head and part Nick in Boston for the all things comedy tour.

716
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.480
They were great guys and had the pleasure of sitting with Bart Nick at,

717
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:31.020
at the bar while Jay crushed it on stage.
Cool dudes.

718
00:43:31.021 --> 00:43:34.860
I would love to drink and smoke stokes with you all some time.

719
00:43:34.861 --> 00:43:37.740
Happy New Year and go fuck yourself.
You Apron wearing cont.

720
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.590
Uh,
that was a good one.
You passed it.
Um,

721
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.630
I think I've already told the,
uh,
the stories.
Yeah.

722
00:43:48.631 --> 00:43:53.070
Throwing the football and the food.
I mean,
I dunno,
I was pretty sober,

723
00:43:53.071 --> 00:43:57.630
but I was kind of a consistent,
leveled,
like blacked out.

724
00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.453
Um,

725
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:01.230
<v 1>okay.</v>

726
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.940
<v 0>I Dunno what,
what was it this year?</v>

727
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.030
Just the whole fucking thing,
you know,
it was cool.

728
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:12.250
I was watching a father with his two sons and he was playing automatic Qb,

729
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.950
it teaching his kid the cornerback to get inside,
you know,

730
00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.100
inside the receiver and a watching the big brother,

731
00:44:18.101 --> 00:44:21.670
older brother fucking rivalry reminded me when I was a kid,

732
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.090
I sat there smiling,
drinking a beer,
probably look like a pedophile,

733
00:44:25.091 --> 00:44:28.060
but I was actually thinking nothing but clean stuff.

734
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.300
Everybody looks like a pedophile now.
Um,
I dunno,

735
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.750
I gotta be honest with you the whole fucking days that God damn blur.

736
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:39.210
I remember most of the game I did.

737
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.600
I passed out a little bit in the first quarter for about a minute and a half

738
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.620
football time.
And then in the second quarter for about a minute and a half.
But,

739
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:49.950
uh,
other than that,
you know,
I s crushed waters for the rest of the fucking game.

740
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:53.550
I didn't have any beers afterwards because I had to drive and that's by then,

741
00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.920
you know,
we stayed there till like eight 30,
nine o'clock at night.

742
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:59.490
So by then I haven't drank and like eight hours.
So I'm actually so sober,

743
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:04.170
I'm fucking hung over at that point.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

744
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:06.180
Australian beaches bill.

745
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.230
<v 3>Okay.</v>

746
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:10.170
<v 0>You talk about sharks and how they eat people constantly.</v>

747
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:14.490
Is this going to keep you out of the water in Australia?
Ah,
you know what?

748
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:18.750
I love to say yes,
but I know if we have time,

749
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:21.210
my wife loves the ocean and um,

750
00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:22.680
<v 3>okay.</v>

751
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.980
<v 0>I gotta be honest with me.
I've never seen beaches like in Australia.</v>

752
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.420
Last time I was there,
um,
which was two years ago,

753
00:45:31.421 --> 00:45:35.020
this past October,
I was in Sydney and we talk,

754
00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:38.050
we took a walk along the coastline and um,

755
00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:42.100
and it was really rough waters and stuff,
but it was so fucking beautiful.

756
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.790
The only thing that stopped me was it was freezing cold out and the rough water

757
00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:49.360
and I'm fucking terrified,
you know?
Yeah.
He's swimming in an ocean.

758
00:45:49.361 --> 00:45:52.780
It's fucking alive.
Okay.
You swim in a pool,

759
00:45:52.781 --> 00:45:55.930
there's nothing in there that can eat you.
And then also like,
there's no like,

760
00:45:55.931 --> 00:45:59.860
undercurrent,
rip tide and all of that shit.
You know,

761
00:45:59.861 --> 00:46:03.690
the ocean just doesn't itself doesn't decide that it wants to kill you.
Um,

762
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:04.910
<v 3>yeah.</v>

763
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:08.180
<v 0>Well I go into it.
Yeah,
probably,
uh,</v>

764
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.370
but no more than up to my waist.

765
00:46:10.371 --> 00:46:12.980
And then I'll go back and I'll be freaking out that there's something fucking

766
00:46:12.981 --> 00:46:16.850
swimming along there.
Um,
I do have to tell you,
since flying helicopters,

767
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.220
you can't believe what the fuck is out there just off the shore.
Um,

768
00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.530
everything from like,
you know,

769
00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.600
a group of porpoises jumping out of the fucking water,
which is cool to see.

770
00:46:29.601 --> 00:46:32.690
And then you'll just see some big fucking thing by itself.
And you're like,

771
00:46:32.691 --> 00:46:35.930
was that a shark?
Is that a whale?
What the fuck is that?

772
00:46:35.931 --> 00:46:37.990
And you'll look like diagonally up like I dunno,

773
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:41.300
but a half a mile and there's a bunch of people sitting on surfboards waiting to

774
00:46:41.301 --> 00:46:45.920
fucking catch a wave.
And uh,
I am,
I'm all set on that.

775
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:51.130
I'm all fucking set on that.
Um,
so anyways,

776
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:55.460
uh,
baking,
hey,
Jeez,
I'm fucking terror through these goddamn questions.

777
00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.430
Oh No,
we got 46 minutes in.
Okay.
Plus I get some of the topics I can talk about.

778
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.380
Anyways,
baking bill,

779
00:47:02.381 --> 00:47:07.381
I'm a 34 year old husband and father of a two year old boy I work had in our

780
00:47:10.151 --> 00:47:14.710
family is doing well.
The hard work does take a toll.
And at the end of the day,

781
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:15.850
I had a heart.

782
00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:19.600
I have a hard time winding down because work is always racing through my mind.

783
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:25.150
Hearing about you baking gave me the idea to try the same.
Ah,
Jesus.

784
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.160
Look what I'm doing.
The men in this country,

785
00:47:27.161 --> 00:47:29.880
because another guy got to go buy an apron.
Uh,

786
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.730
don't even listen to these fucking assholes.

787
00:47:31.731 --> 00:47:34.090
And one of the coolest things you can do is go out in the kitchen and make a

788
00:47:34.091 --> 00:47:38.950
fucking killer.
God damned meal.
I swear to God we gave we,
we applauded.

789
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.250
Jason lie ahead more than we did those fucking teams.

790
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.650
The level of this guy was cooking.
All right.

791
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:47.320
I guess it's more mainly shit cause it's,
I don't know,
an open flame,

792
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.050
all of that type of shit,
but whatever do put on a fucking apron,

793
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.680
make it God damn pine pants,
Syrah,

794
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.960
fucking pork chop and then talk to me anyways at night.

795
00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.800
Now after my kid goes to bed and my wife and I are hanging out,

796
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:04.270
I'll make a bread or a pie every night.
Dude,
you're going to be a house.

797
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.261
He goes,

798
00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:08.830
I'm getting really particular about my techniques now and take pride in the

799
00:48:08.831 --> 00:48:11.140
little things.
It's very zen.
Absolutely.

800
00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:14.290
A one in five or six baking sessions.

801
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:17.710
I'll take a small hit off a joint and it's a perfect evening.

802
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.640
Thanks for exposing me to the idea and laughing at yourself from people on

803
00:48:21.641 --> 00:48:25.330
Twitter.
Make comics about you being some type of Sally.

804
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.720
I gotta be honest with you.
That shit always makes me laugh.

805
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:33.220
Anybody calls me twinkle toes.

806
00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:37.860
There was Sally that is always fucking made me laugh.
I don't give a fuck.
Uh,

807
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:38.861
and he says anyways,

808
00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:43.030
it beats getting one of those small Japanese rock gardens from my desk.
Thanks.

809
00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:44.800
And Go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
that's great man.

810
00:48:44.801 --> 00:48:47.950
I would just be careful about making pies and bread every day.
You'll be,

811
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:50.860
you'll be,
you'll be a fucking house.
But,
um,

812
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:53.171
I dunno man.

813
00:48:53.171 --> 00:48:58.171
I'm actually going to try to learn some vegetarian main courses so I can offset

814
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.180
everything else that I'm learning how to do.

815
00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:05.380
Like I wanna learn how to make a fucking,
uh,
uh,
Sunday gravy.

816
00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.950
Um,
cause I already know how to make pasta,

817
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.400
homemade pasta and I'm going to get a Ravioli maker and I'm going to do

818
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:17.401
something like that or make some Rigatoni Briga Falken Antony over there and I'm

819
00:49:18.281 --> 00:49:21.250
going to a,
I want to make a Sunday gravy or something like that,

820
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:22.570
which I'm dying to do,

821
00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.460
although I'm kind of afraid of canned tomatoes because I know then they don't

822
00:49:27.461 --> 00:49:32.380
taste good and they're all so they're really bad for you.
And,
uh,
all I have,

823
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:36.490
I have two tomato plants out in my front yard and uh,

824
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.113
<v 1>you know</v>

825
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.420
<v 0>what their yield,
I fucking eat.
I don't jar any of those things,</v>

826
00:49:41.421 --> 00:49:46.040
but I'm always just like a closet fucking Italian here because I actually want

827
00:49:46.041 --> 00:49:51.041
to get a decent number of tomato plants out of my front yard and then just

828
00:49:51.561 --> 00:49:52.394
fucking,

829
00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.293
<v 1>you know,</v>

830
00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.940
<v 0>as they become right.
Obviously pick them.
And then I was going to,
you know,</v>

831
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:02.320
skin the fucking things and then push them into a jar and then jar and then have

832
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:05.710
tomatoes,
my sauce all fucking year.
That's what I want to do.

833
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:09.730
Rather than getting these fucking tomatoes had been in Cannes for years and God

834
00:50:09.731 --> 00:50:13.530
knows what they do here,
you know,
you hear Shit right?
So anyways,
that,

835
00:50:13.531 --> 00:50:17.680
congratulations sir.
It's a great thing to do.
And any young people out there,

836
00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:22.690
all right.
Men and women,
women cooking as a lost fucking art.

837
00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:24.730
I don't know why you guys ever stopped doing it.

838
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.850
Nothing will shut your guy up quicker than making them a great God damn mail

839
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:34.200
here.
Eat it and go fuck yourself.
It's over.
He's going to have that in his head.

840
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:39.810
This is not new information.
Women knew that a long time ago.

841
00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:43.220
Then somewhere along the line when they started growing out there fucking snatch

842
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:46.950
air when they quit using deodorant,
burning their bras,
that whole fucking thing.

843
00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:52.980
Uh,
you know,
they,
they,
they forgot some good things like,
hey,
you know,

844
00:50:52.981 --> 00:50:54.750
make the guy a fucking sandwich every once in a while,

845
00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:59.460
watch him shut the fuck up.
They just won't do it.
But anyways,
guys telling you,

846
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.960
telling you right now,
all right,

847
00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.430
telling you if I could fucking cook the way I cook now back when I was a single

848
00:51:08.431 --> 00:51:10.200
fucking man,
I just know what it would have been over.

849
00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.630
One of my big regrets in life,

850
00:51:12.631 --> 00:51:15.180
I didn't learn how to make a pike rest until I was in a committed relationship.

851
00:51:15.181 --> 00:51:18.270
God dammit.
What an asshole.
Uh,
girlfriend says,

852
00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:22.660
girlfriends keep sex tape from previous relationship.
Everybody

853
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.400
see where this one's going?
Okay.
Oh,
this is a heads.
This one has,
oh,

854
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:31.680
Jesus written all over it.
Hey Bill,
I've been listening for the past three years.

855
00:51:31.681 --> 00:51:32.790
I love the podcast.

856
00:51:32.791 --> 00:51:36.390
Especially when you freak out and throw tantrums and call yourself up by name.

857
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:40.320
He says in parentheses all really bill.
Yeah,
I guess I do that.

858
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.560
Those are the best ones,
but I have a situation.

859
00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.490
I got a situation that might be of interest to you.

860
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:52.350
My girlfriend of almost a year has a sex tape.
Uh,

861
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.890
my girlfriend of almost a year has a sex tape with,

862
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.390
with her previous boyfriend.

863
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:04.190
What?
In the past she was very insecure in week,

864
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.290
very impressionable.

865
00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.310
I believe this is why she was ever talked into such a thing,

866
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.250
but maybe I don't give her enough credit.

867
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:14.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

868
00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.320
<v 0>I can accept that.
She made one in her past.</v>

869
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.090
Her experiences made her who she is.
Oh,
Jesus.
However,

870
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:27.190
she made the decision to keep this tape.
Anyways,
after the fact,
she says,

871
00:52:27.191 --> 00:52:31.360
I like keeping things that remind me of people and moments that made me smile.

872
00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:36.580
Even if they were mistakes and didn't work out.
Oh,
go fuck yourself.

873
00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.100
Yeah,
dude,
why don't you try this same thing?

874
00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:45.010
Why don't you try this same thing?
Oh my God.

875
00:52:45.011 --> 00:52:46.710
What a fuck.
You know,
I got to plug it up,

876
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.090
almost stopping a plotter for that fucking line.

877
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:54.660
She also says that she wants to watch this tape as she gets older because she

878
00:52:55.511 --> 00:52:58.630
will want to remember when she had a great body.

879
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.920
You said,
I kind of manipulated her into showing me this tape.
What though?

880
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.310
By telling her that I think it's hot and that it might turn me on.

881
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:17.790
She had only been shy about mentioning it,
mentioning it in the past,

882
00:53:17.791 --> 00:53:18.840
kind of teasing,

883
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:24.090
but maybe she was just afraid of my reaction and was testing how I was reacting.

884
00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:28.750
All right.
This is fear,
sir.
My fear is

885
00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:35.370
that your girlfriend is a freak and she keeps meeting guys that are not

886
00:53:35.951 --> 00:53:39.400
relationship guys,
so now that she's met you,

887
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.990
you know this is our own little fucking freak thing that she kind of keeps it in

888
00:53:43.991 --> 00:53:47.140
that I'm worried that she's going to be doing shit and this guy is going to be

889
00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:51.130
doing stuff to her that you have not done or even thought about doing.
Okay.

890
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:52.960
In other words,
I'm waiting for you.

891
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:58.120
I'm worried you're going to see a load on her face.
All right there.

892
00:53:58.121 --> 00:54:01.330
That's my concern.
All right.
When I saw it,

893
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:07.000
I felt so repulsed.
It was the unsexy as thing I've ever seen.

894
00:54:07.001 --> 00:54:11.560
All right.
Well,
well but the other way she was traumatized too.
Very traumatized.

895
00:54:11.561 --> 00:54:15.250
So I kept my cool and competencies around before I head to head home.

896
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.090
Wait a minute.
So she pops this thing in.

897
00:54:19.091 --> 00:54:21.250
You guys are both horrified

898
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:26.060
and did she start crying and then you shut it off?
It had to be like,

899
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.130
well you know I'll call you tomorrow.

900
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:34.820
I don't mean to laugh sir,
but this is I,

901
00:54:34.821 --> 00:54:37.970
this is supposed to be a funny podcast so I got to keep the comedy coming here.

902
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.830
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.
All right,
here we go.

903
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.510
Now she says,

904
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.070
<v 3>okay,</v>

905
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:51.070
<v 0>did I act weird and that she's sorry that she hurt me but she doesn't apologize</v>

906
00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:56.900
about keeping this tape,
nor have I asked it to.
I think it's beside the point.

907
00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.190
If she only does it to appease me.
Oh she,

908
00:55:01.191 --> 00:55:04.850
she has to get rid of it cause she wants to is what you're saying?

909
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:08.330
Am I reacting out of a bruised,
macho ego?

910
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.580
I could never imagine keeping a sex tape from another relationship while I'm in

911
00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:15.110
a new one.
Yeah.

912
00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.420
I don't even keep the normal photos tagged on my Facebook.
What's your advice?

913
00:55:20.421 --> 00:55:22.280
And maybe Nia can add her opinion too,

914
00:55:22.281 --> 00:55:25.010
since she might think I'm being possessive or judgmental.

915
00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.020
It would mean a lot to get your advice.
Thanks a lot.
And Go fuck yourself.
Well,

916
00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.610
she's upstairs.
He's heard of Marty driving a fucking nuts.
Um,

917
00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.500
no,
dude,
you're not.
You're not.
This is completely fucked up.

918
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.750
It's fucked up in,
it's weird

919
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.720
that she would keep that fucking tape.

920
00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.700
It's fucking weird dude.
Like,
come on man.

921
00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.930
Can you imagine saying that to your girlfriend?
Hey,

922
00:55:57.931 --> 00:56:01.530
I got a sex tape from the last woman I used to hook up with,
but uh,

923
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.090
I just keep it,
you know,

924
00:56:03.091 --> 00:56:07.860
cause I like to keep things from my past that,
you know,

925
00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:11.440
remind me of things that I've done,
even if they were my mistakes.
But you know,

926
00:56:11.441 --> 00:56:13.830
with the end of the day,
it just kinda makes me smile.

927
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:16.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

928
00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.070
<v 0>She would do,
would just be dead silence.
So you would just,
she would be,</v>

929
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:24.000
what the fuck did you just say?
And then as start at the top,
she

930
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.690
<v 3>tell you to shut the fuck up as she proceeded to break up with you.</v>

931
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:31.400
<v 0>Because to me that's like,</v>

932
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.070
<v 3>okay,</v>

933
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:37.280
<v 0>it's,
it's bizarre.
This is,
this isn't fair because I'm reading this.</v>

934
00:56:37.281 --> 00:56:39.500
I didn't hear how she said it.
I don't know anything about her,

935
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:41.540
but that's fucking bizarre.

936
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:46.160
That's not,
it's just not cool.

937
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.033
<v 3>MMM.</v>

938
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:51.240
<v 0>It'd be bad enough if you somehow found it,</v>

939
00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:54.090
but at least she had the decency to keep it a secret.

940
00:56:54.091 --> 00:56:56.920
But the fact that she even fucking tells you about it then it ain't like he's

941
00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.850
just makes me smile.
You know?
Like,

942
00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:02.070
like she has a fucking quilter grandmother made.

943
00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:04.200
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

944
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.870
<v 0>I don't know,
Dude.
I don't think,
I think you gotta be like,
look,</v>

945
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.870
you need to get fucking get rid of that thing.
Okay.
That's fucked up.

946
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:11.320
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

947
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.980
<v 0>Okay.
And,
and,
and fuck,
you're fragile state.</v>

948
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:20.950
Okay.
Fuck your state.
What about my state?
All right.

949
00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:22.780
Get rid of the fucking thick.

950
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.500
That's what I would say without all the fucks in the anger.

951
00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.580
Get rid of the fucking thick.
I know,
Dude.
That's fucking weird.

952
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.390
All right,
next one.
Oh wait.
You know what?
Let me,

953
00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:39.530
let me read the last bit of advertising and then I'll,
I'll knock this one out.

954
00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.180
No bullshit.
Some more,
and that'll be a podcast for the week.
Oh for fuck sakes.

955
00:57:44.181 --> 00:57:48.670
Here we go.
What is going on here?

956
00:57:48.671 --> 00:57:52.530
Where the fuck is it?
Come on bill.
You can do it.
Live reads.
All right.

957
00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:55.930
Going to have kings.

Me undies.
Mandy's dollar shave club.
We did that.

958
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:01.960
All right,
the last two.
Oh,

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:32.720
There's nothing wrong with it.
Hello Bill,

1016
01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.920
longtime listener here and I'm writing to you today for some advice.

1017
01:01:36.921 --> 01:01:41.810
I'm a 23 three year old man and currently have the hots for a 26 year old

1018
01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:44.540
manager.
Just a little background,

1019
01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:48.650
she's originally from Louisiana and is smoking hot.
I love her already.

1020
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:53.330
She just moved here around a year ago and always complains to me about being

1021
01:01:53.331 --> 01:01:57.620
lonely because she does not know many people here in Cali.
Fuck toad.

1022
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:59.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1023
01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:01.900
<v 0>She's laying it right on the table for you.
What is she going to do?</v>

1024
01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:05.020
Fucking throw her legs in the air.
First of all,

1025
01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:08.320
you said you're 22 now you're telling me you're 23 anyways.

1026
01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.070
She's always being extra nice to me like buying me,
buying lunches,

1027
01:02:12.071 --> 01:02:14.890
always checking up on me and staying a while to chat.

1028
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.850
It gives me the eyes from time to time.
Where do you live in the,

1029
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:24.200
you might be mistaking her southern house house puts hospitality cause he used

1030
01:02:24.201 --> 01:02:26.210
to some fucking cold east coast women.

1031
01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.410
The fuck are you looking at your fucking Douche bag?
Right.

1032
01:02:30.411 --> 01:02:35.130
And all of a sudden she comes up,
you all know Napkin.
Don't she wants to suck it.

1033
01:02:35.131 --> 01:02:39.400
Yeah.
Just make sure it's not that.
Anyways,
um,

1034
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:45.840
me considering myself a pretty handsome guy,
I was thinking if I have a shot,

1035
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.390
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1036
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:51.620
<v 0>Thinking if I have a shot or what,
come on guys,
I suck at reading.</v>

1037
01:02:51.621 --> 01:02:52.630
You've got to proofread these things.

1038
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.990
I was thinking if I have a shot or am I just over my head here?
No.
Yeah.

1039
01:02:56.991 --> 01:03:00.140
Not totally have a shot.
Just this new year's.

1040
01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:03.410
She was constantly complaining about,
she had no invitations to new years.
Dude,

1041
01:03:03.411 --> 01:03:07.130
this woman is throwing it at you.
So me making a joke,

1042
01:03:07.131 --> 01:03:09.470
since I also did not have any plans,
said,
hey,

1043
01:03:09.471 --> 01:03:11.870
maybe we should hang out and get and drinks of wine.

1044
01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.010
You think I can have a shot?
If so,

1045
01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.190
how would I go about hanging out at her place?

1046
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:24.290
I live with my parents that Jesus or am I taking her kindness for flirting?

1047
01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:28.610
Oh,
Jesus do Jesus.
We've got to get you in the game.
Thanks again,
Bill.

1048
01:03:28.611 --> 01:03:32.780
Great seeing you at the White House.
Spare that did that.
All right.
Hey,
dope.

1049
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:36.320
Do you know we've got to do it?
You know I'm going to do right now.

1050
01:03:36.321 --> 01:03:38.450
I'm gonna make you,
you.
I got to get you to stand up straight.

1051
01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.413
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1052
01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:45.310
<v 0>Eat.
Don't have a say.
Maybe.
You know,</v>

1053
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:48.030
maybe we should if there's no baby.

1054
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:50.080
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1055
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.560
<v 0>you got to tell her that.
Let's hang out.
Don't say it like that.</v>

1056
01:03:53.561 --> 01:03:55.150
Say I don't get dumb pitch.
I'll say it like that.

1057
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:56.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1058
01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:02.890
<v 0>Yeah.
Just tell him,
let's hang out.
Let's have some fucking wild.
Let's say,</v>

1059
01:04:02.891 --> 01:04:05.830
what do you want to do?
I'll show you around town.
I'd say that.

1060
01:04:05.831 --> 01:04:08.910
I'll show you around town.
They need a fucking friend,
Jesus Christ.

1061
01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.480
If I had been in a relationship this fucking long,

1062
01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:16.960
I would just fucking come up to her and just say,
listen,
I do wait.

1063
01:04:16.961 --> 01:04:19.840
She's your manager.
Who gives a fuck,
dude,

1064
01:04:19.841 --> 01:04:22.750
you're 23 have you fucked a manager yet?

1065
01:04:22.751 --> 01:04:27.250
You got to fuck one boss and see what that does to your fucking professional and

1066
01:04:27.251 --> 01:04:29.140
personal life.
You get,
you learn that lesson,

1067
01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:31.540
you'll be a better man because of it.
You just got to fucking,

1068
01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:35.470
she's already thrown it at you.
You got to tell her you going to hang up.

1069
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.960
Then you got the fucking out too,
because she's your boss.
Be like,
hey,

1070
01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:40.780
we can't to get through fucking hot and heavy here because the whole business

1071
01:04:40.781 --> 01:04:44.290
thing,
right.
Plus she's three,
four years older than you.
You know what I mean?

1072
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:48.500
I think she's just looking for somebody to fucking hang out with and uh,

1073
01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.130
give her a nice one.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Bill.

1074
01:04:51.131 --> 01:04:54.250
That was fucking,
that was very piggish.
That was very piggish.

1075
01:04:54.251 --> 01:04:58.870
But you're totally in the game.
Okay?
She's smoking hot.

1076
01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:01.170
She's got that southern accent.
This is fucking killing.

1077
01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:05.320
It's killing me right now that you're not banging her yet.
All right.

1078
01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.160
And you know what?

1079
01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.610
Who have a fucking fucking woman who is offended by saying that too?

1080
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:12.690
That I said that.
All right.
Jesus Christ.
It could get that.

1081
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.910
Could they fucking bitch anymore?
Good Lord.
Every fucking days on the Internet,

1082
01:05:17.911 --> 01:05:20.370
there's another article about what men are doing wrong.

1083
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.850
I'm going to give women in general advice.

1084
01:05:23.851 --> 01:05:26.760
It stopped rolling your fucking eyes at me.
Okay.
You're getting makeup.

1085
01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:29.340
All of your eyebrows.
All right.
Listen to me.

1086
01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:30.990
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1087
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.070
<v 0>This is what you need to do.</v>

1088
01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:36.390
Stop telling men that you don't give a fuck anymore about what they think.
Okay?

1089
01:05:36.391 --> 01:05:40.020
The mere fact that you taking the time to do that means you give a fuck.

1090
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:41.850
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1091
01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:45.710
<v 0>Just,
just fucking
do your own shit.</v>

1092
01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.960
You sick a guy's running shit.
Start Your own shit for the life of me.

1093
01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:54.740
I don't know why they don't go out and start their own shit more often.

1094
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.560
Look,
look and look at the fucking woman,
I guess in my business.

1095
01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.213
<v 3>Okay?</v>

1096
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.260
<v 0>I can think of like three right now.
Who's fucking,</v>

1097
01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:06.870
rather than sitting around udo good roles to women,

1098
01:06:06.871 --> 01:06:10.530
they sat down and wrote a fucking script and got the fucking thing made and now

1099
01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:13.800
they call him the shot.
That's what you do.
Actually,
man,
man or woman.

1100
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:15.630
That's what the fuck you do.

1101
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:20.870
But this whole fucking bullshit where you sit there and you say,

1102
01:06:21.361 --> 01:06:25.640
what's wrong with your life by criticizing the other sex,
all that.

1103
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:30.980
Okay.
Uh,
my record is shit.

1104
01:06:30.981 --> 01:06:35.900
The bed or God is a feminist,
um,

1105
01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:38.780
picky.
The one I,
uh,

1106
01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.530
I just listened to it beginning of the podcast and heard that I did say June 5th

1107
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.910
instead of January 5th.

1108
01:06:43.911 --> 01:06:47.480
So I'm sure you guys were all attacking me on Twitter now and joining,

1109
01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:51.590
making fun of me yet again this year.
A happy new year to everybody.

1110
01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:53.630
Go fuck yourselves.
I hope you have a wonderful week.

1111
01:06:53.631 --> 01:06:58.220
I'm nervous about the patriots playing the Ravens.
They got a hell of a defense.

1112
01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.680
And uh,
I dunno,
I don't like that game at all.

1113
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.540
Don't like that game at all.
But we'll see what happens.

1114
01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:07.560
I'll talk to you guys next week.
Go Fuck Yourself.
