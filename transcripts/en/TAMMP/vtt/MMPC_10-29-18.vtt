00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.870
B.
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.310
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.610
August 29th,

4
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.780
2080 Oh happy baseball championship.
Pappy baseball championship.

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.640
Why am I in such a good mood?

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.140
Why do I want to walk down the street with a fucking bass drum kick in my

7
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.610
fucking feed up in the air?

8
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.940
Because your 2018 Boston red sox once again are world series champions.

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.850
Do you believe it?

10
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.863
<v 1>Okay,</v>

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.340
<v 0>I think I speak for all the New England when I say fuck anyone.</v>

12
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.923
<v 2>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.780
<v 1>Unbelievable.</v>

14
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.351
<v 0>Unbelievable.</v>

15
00:00:50.351 --> 00:00:54.280
I remember after 2003 thinking all I want to do is just see these fucking

16
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:55.090
assholes.

17
00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.090
Just one buck and time have a clutch fucking moment in your fucking life.

18
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.640
You Red Sox were in concert stats where I was at.

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.733
<v 1>All right,</v>

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.530
<v 0>and the very next year they went in and I was like,
you know what?
That's it.
I,</v>

21
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.850
you know,
I'm in such a good mood.

22
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.550
I don't give a fuck that my phone is making noise in the background.

23
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:16.950
That's what's over in a great mood.
I'm in all,
I wanted to see what you,

24
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:20.320
some when it once now only to get to see him when at once now I,
anyway,

25
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.560
I tried three times.
Four Times.

26
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.670
<v 0>The one buying the Patriots.</v>

28
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.450
<v 0>So all you haters out there,
just in case you lost count in this century,</v>

30
00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:33.270
we won five Superbowls,

31
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.310
four world series titles and Nba Championship and a Stanley Cup and one of those

32
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:43.210
soccer championships,
mls,
whatever.
They,
but when did championships and stuff,

33
00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:44.380
I don't even give a fuck about.

34
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.623
<v 1>All right.</v>

35
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.580
<v 0>And for all,
you guys don't,
and does it get old after a while?</v>

36
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.110
Don't you get tired of it?

37
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.070
<v 1>No.</v>

38
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.960
<v 0>Fucking awesome.
It's fucking awesome.</v>

39
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.363
<v 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.450
<v 0>and you know,
if it doesn't happen to us,</v>

41
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.230
I hope it happens to you someday unless you were in fucking New York or in

42
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:08.580
Montreal or a Laker Fan.
Other than that,
I,
I got no fucking problem with anybody.

43
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.240
<v 1>Um,
unbelievable.
Uh,</v>

44
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.460
<v 0>I know what to say.
You know,
what's this?</v>

45
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.310
We don't have as Jackie Bradley jr or JD Martinez,

46
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.600
one of them said after game three that I was at,

47
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.410
I can't believe I was at the game.

48
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.043
<v 1>MMM.</v>

49
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.850
<v 0>He said,
I've never seen it take a team,</v>

50
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.280
get just get punched in the face and then just get up like nothing happened.

51
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.770
Like this team,
something like that.
I know I'm butchering it,

52
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.510
but it was just perfect.

53
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.970
<v 0>Um,
they would just never out of it.
I have not seen a team score.</v>

55
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:48.971
This many fucking runs with two outs be down this much since the 1998 New York

56
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:53.620
Yankees,
which is probably the best team I've ever seen.

57
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.373
<v 1>MMM.</v>

58
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.620
<v 0>The only other team in my lifetime,
and I vaguely remember them,</v>

59
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:04.150
was maybe the big red machine.
Um,
I mean that team,

60
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.560
that team was fucking incredible.
That was just another team that was just like,

61
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.600
they were just stacked.
All right.
You know what I'm going to,
I'm not,

62
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.350
I'm lying a little bit that,
that phone thing is going to bug me here.

63
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.520
This continues to happen here.
All right.
Uh,

64
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.450
oh fuck.
Am I supposed to talk about that shit too.

65
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.630
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
um,
congratulations to the Dodgers,
man.
Jesus Christ.</v>

66
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:30.560
See another great season.
You just came up short.

67
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.950
All I can tell you having been through that.

68
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.283
<v 0>MMM,</v>

69
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.970
<v 1>yeah,
no,
it just makes it all the more sweeter when you finally when it,
but uh,</v>

70
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.650
you know,
so we went to game theory.
What a fucking great stadium by the way.

71
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.040
And not always a great stadium that the Dodgers have like the stadium.

72
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.620
It's just considering when it was built and there was so many of those soldiers,

73
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.473
cookie cutter,

74
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.030
<v 0>um,
baseball stadiums that they made.
They were multipurpose.</v>

75
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:01.570
Basically all of them were to design so you could play football and baseball

76
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:06.190
back there.
A very like forward thinking,

77
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.810
money saving environmentally friendly thing that we did.

78
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.790
And then we all decided like,
you know what?
Fuck these stadiums.
They're old.

79
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.720
Why fix him up?
I don't understand why you just can't fix him up.

80
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:23.500
They're made out of metal and concrete.
They're not gone anywhere.

81
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.440
That's like,
yeah,
getting fucking car.

82
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:29.170
You have the fucking engine block is made out of steel.

83
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.040
As long as you take care of it,
it's gonna,
it's gonna run forever.

84
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.140
Everybody's just throw shit out.

85
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.830
So they knocked down all of these fucking stadiums and then rebuild.
Not at one,

86
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:40.240
but two more stadiums.

87
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.860
We where I want my own stadium.

88
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.120
I don't want to share,
although,
you know,

89
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.270
I did boomer Esiason show boomer in and it was it Gino and uh,

90
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.730
<v 3>okay.</v>

91
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.790
<v 0>He was talking about what it was like to play for the Cincinnati,</v>

92
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.760
Cincinnati Bangles in the same in riverfront stadium.

93
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.620
He said Dow these to cover a home plate with a piece of wood and then just

94
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.470
through astro turf on top of it.
So if you get tackled on that,

95
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.580
basically it's like you laid it on somebody's tree fort.
So I guess,
you know,

96
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.440
maybe that's the reason,
but I would,

97
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.050
what I thought they could've come up with some sort of technology where they

98
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:22.770
didn't have to fuck it.
That was just basically,
cause it was astro turf.
Right.

99
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.230
I don't know.
I don't pretend to understand,
but,
um,
me and my buddies,

100
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:32.090
we went to game three and,
uh,
I didn't wear any red sox.

101
00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:34.320
Shit's still almost got into a fight.

102
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.830
Fucking west coast still almost got into a fight.

103
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.940
Unfucking believable,
you know,
there was like,

104
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:46.890
what killed me was we went to the game and there was so many empty seats because

105
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:50.670
stub hub just gouge the shit out of every,
they were charging like 700 bucks.

106
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.680
I was at the top of the state and those tickets were over $700.
And you know,

107
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.800
I guess stubhub was,
can tend to be like,
well,
you know,

108
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.370
we'll make it four times the fucking face value of the ticket.
What,

109
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.730
what do we give a shit if every,
you know,

110
00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:09.540
three out of every four seats is empty almost.
You know,
it wasn't that bad,

111
00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:14.250
but they were big giant swaths of fucking rows that were,
were just,

112
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.200
nobody was there,
um,
from the bottom all the way up to the top.

113
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.740
And I,
you know,
people got flat screen TVs,
they don't need that shit.

114
00:06:22.741 --> 00:06:24.540
They gonna come home,
they'll see the fucking replay.

115
00:06:24.541 --> 00:06:27.210
They'll know the pitch count,
they'll,
you know,
all that shit rather than,

116
00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:28.500
than being like me trying to figure it out.

117
00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:32.880
The scoreboard with my fucked up eyes at this point.
MMM,

118
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.370
<v 3>okay.</v>

119
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.540
<v 0>So anyways,
my buddy,
you know,</v>

120
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:37.760
he's having a few beers and then when he was finished and we just setting them

121
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.860
in the row behind,
he said it was like basically empty.

122
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.630
So there was a guy behind there and you know,
all he had to say was,
hey guys,

123
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:47.150
do you mind just keeping your empties on you in your role?
Just because,
uh,

124
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:51.680
you know,
me and the kid and the kid won't try to get by here and oh sorry,
do it.

125
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.810
No problem.
That's how would have gone down.
But instead,

126
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.980
cause he's a west coast guy,
you know,
they still fucking laid back out here.

127
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:59.780
He immediately just says to my buddy,
good,

128
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:03.410
this is how we entered the conversation.
He goes,
he's like,
hey buddy,

129
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.690
is there something wrong with the underneath the chair?
Oh,
I'm Fred.
Turns around,

130
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.790
looks at him immediate with that look on his face.
Like,
wow,

131
00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:15.140
I'm about ready to get into a fight.
And he's like,
what?
He goes,

132
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.780
there's something wrong with the underneath part of your chair.
And he's like,
no.

133
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.680
He goes,
why don't you put,
she empties there?
And he goes,
oh,

134
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:22.770
well there was nobody sitting there.
And then it fucking in,

135
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.990
in like literally like fucking flash paper escalates to this level.

136
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:30.290
So I'm sitting there,
so I just go,
you know,

137
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.680
<v 3>okay,</v>

138
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.210
<v 0>I've been out here long enough.
I'm a veteran.</v>

139
00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:34.650
Like I know this is going to happen.

140
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

141
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.530
<v 0>Like you could literally go to the game fucking dressed like Jesus are Santa</v>

142
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.530
Claus.
Whatever the fuck you're into.
And still somebody is going to be like,

143
00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:46.230
you know,
hey,
fuck it.
Uh,
hey whitey.

144
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:47.950
<v 3>Okay.</v>

145
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.040
<v 0>You think you cannot have your fucking beard blowing over your shoulder block</v>

146
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:55.850
and a half to fucking feel like something's going to happen?
A Santa is,

147
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.080
you still read?
What are you a fucking cardinals fan?
You know,

148
00:07:58.081 --> 00:07:59.040
and all of a sudden you're into it.

149
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.610
So I just turned around and looked at both of them.
I just go,
ladies,
ladies,

150
00:08:02.611 --> 00:08:06.600
ladies.
What's usually diffuses it?
Somebody saying,
ladies,
all right,

151
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.830
then you realize I got,
alright,
I'm acting like I got it fucking Tampon on,
right?

152
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.910
I go,
we're at the world series game for how?
Come on,
let's have a good time,

153
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.440
right?
So I got to shake the guy's hand behind me and he leaves me hanging.

154
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.220
<v 3>Okay,</v>

155
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.830
<v 0>so now I'm fucking mad.
I don't say anything to the guy.</v>

156
00:08:22.831 --> 00:08:24.860
And then I just got just fucking sit out.

157
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:29.861
So we sit down and then I for for fucking hitting and loudly talking about what

158
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.750
level of fucking asshole fans,

159
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.800
fucking asshole fans that are out here on the fucking west coast.

160
00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:41.660
It's just like they go to the game to get into a fight.
It's just like,

161
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.590
so after eating half of that,
I'm like,
dude,

162
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.500
do you really want to keep doing this?
And it's like,
no I don't.
So I get up,

163
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.710
I go down and get a beer and I'm coming back and I'm going some walking up the

164
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:52.970
aisle,
this fucking guy,

165
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.620
<v 3>okay,</v>

166
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.030
<v 0>it's sitting mean mugging me.
Now this</v>

167
00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.350
<v 1>guy,
he's gotta be like fucking 50 pounds over.
Fucking wait,
there's four of us.</v>

168
00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:02.720
There's one of him.
Now,
granted he's in the row behind us.

169
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.830
I guess maybe he could fall on us and do some fucking damage,

170
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.880
but if we wanted to,
we all probably could have picked him up and thrown him up.

171
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.320
We were the second to last row,

172
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.070
literally just thrown him off the back of the fucking stadium.
All right.

173
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.100
And when you're dealing with people from Boston,
that is,
uh,
that is,
uh,

174
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.610
there's a chance that there's that level of fucking anger involved.

175
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.130
It wasn't us,
but I'm just saying this guy could give a fuck.

176
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.250
So fucking staring at me as I'm walking up,

177
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.340
he's with his wife and kid and he's fucking staring at us like,

178
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.120
like fucking William Wallace staring at me,
I should say,
as I'm coming up.

179
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.910
So I'm literally,
my eyes are fucking bad at this point,
so I'm like,

180
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:46.310
is this guy staring at me?
So when you're fucking old,

181
00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:48.980
you gotta either squint or you kind of look away and then look at,

182
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.770
look back at something.
So I had to look away to focus on something else,

183
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.960
and then I looked back at him.
I'm like,
yeah,

184
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:56.030
he is staring at me and I just looked away.

185
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:59.180
So he probably thought that was a moment of weakness.
So now he's probably air.

186
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.920
It is.
He's going extra hard with his face now.
I swear to God.

187
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.300
So it just got updated.
I don't know what happened.
All of the anger,
all his shit,

188
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:11.660
it just went away.
I was just like,
buddy,
we really going to do this man.
Come on.

189
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:13.220
I respect the Dodgers.
Ever respect you.

190
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:15.820
We want to try and I apologize for that stuff.
So I got a facility,

191
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.480
I see his face finally relax.
I go to fist bump.
The Guy,
he's so fucking macho,

192
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.330
he can't even like stick his hand and he makes the fist,

193
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.800
but he has his hands still there.
His body.
It's like my daughter when I,

194
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:31.460
when I first like was like teaching her how to wave and she wouldn't like lift

195
00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:32.690
her hand her arm up.

196
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.110
She would just like open and close your hand while it just rested on a leg.

197
00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:40.280
It was like adorable.
But with this guy it was just so,
I don't know what it was.

198
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:42.140
It was just like,
wow,
this guy's got a lot of pain.

199
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:45.140
I don't know what the fuck happened to say.
Fist bump,
long story short

200
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.810
by the end of the game,
even though his Dodgers or lose it.
We're like friends,

201
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.370
we're friendly anyways,
diffused the whole fucking thing and my anger,

202
00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.110
my angry fucking Italian Boston guy and what?
He's like,
dude,

203
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:03.680
how the fuck did you do that?
How to find,
I just said to him,
I was just like,

204
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:05.300
do it.
I go,
I'm,
I'm fucking done with it.

205
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.520
<v 0>Um,
I'm,
I'm not,
I'm not fucking doing this anymore.</v>

206
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.390
I'm not going to fucking go to a fucking baseball game.

207
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.320
And then almost getting as a 50 year old bald fucking dude

208
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.050
<v 1>almost get into a fight</v>

209
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.880
<v 0>over an empty fucking bud lite beer can and where it was placed within this</v>

210
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:28.880
concrete structure.
I'm just,
I'm just not,
I'm not fucking doing it any more.

211
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.130
Right.
Iron.

212
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.180
I already almost gotten into a fight with my wife and I diffuse that because we

213
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:40.181
had pregame at my house and evidently my wife didn't feel like she was invited.

214
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:46.030
I don't know why we were in the house.
She's always been invited.
But what Ha,

215
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.521
you know what happened?

216
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:51.521
I came off the road and I was under the gun where I didn't have a lot of time

217
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.180
<v 1>between getting back to the house,
given her a hug and a kiss,</v>

218
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.710
checking in with my kid and then making sure I had beer for people coming over

219
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:05.410
to go to the game because the game starts at five and I didn't get back from

220
00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:09.220
Phoenix until,
uh,
you know,

221
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:13.900
one o'clock didn't get home til like two.
Right.
So,
you know,

222
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:16.600
they're coming home,
they're coming back.
I'm sorry,
I got home,
I be like one,

223
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.520
one o'clock and my friends were coming over it too.
So I,

224
00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:24.890
I barely hugged and kissed my wife and then asked her to go out and uh,

225
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.620
and get some beer for the guys,
you know,

226
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.410
which is something I never do.
I usually handle everything.
You know,

227
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:35.410
she's always got the honey do lists for me,
but I never had anything for her.

228
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:39.460
So I can you get some beers?
And she's looking at me like,

229
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.210
I just asked her if she could fucking walk on water or something.

230
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.500
So a half hour goes by and I'm looking at my,

231
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.990
are you going to go out and get the beer?
And she goes,
are you serious?

232
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.170
I didn't know you were being serious.
And I was like,
yeah,
I'm being serious.

233
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.480
Like why,
why would I say that as a joke?
And she goes,
well cause you know,
I'm,

234
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.810
I'm just sorta sitting here,
you know,
hanging out and you know,

235
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.840
it's one,
it's one of those,
you know,

236
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.490
it's just one of those things in our relationship where it like one person is

237
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:14.190
going to ask somebody else to do something that they never do themselves or,
or,

238
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.450
or,
or,
or vice versa or something like that.
So I don't know.

239
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:17.650
She couldn't get her fucking head around it.

240
00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.140
So then she goes and she gets the beer,
you know,

241
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.540
she pulls up and of course when she pulls up,
she's like,

242
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:25.570
can you come out here and help me bring the beer in?
Cause that's what the fuck,

243
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:29.680
they can never just fucking do something for.
They still got a draggy and right.

244
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.880
And I miss that text.

245
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:34.390
So my friends went out and helped her out and then she was fucking pissed at me,

246
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.553
a whatever.

247
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.890
So we're driving to the game and she's like texting me about what a jerk I am.

248
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.150
So I fucking diffuse that.
I go to the fucking game,

249
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.960
I diffuse the fat fuck behind us.
That's all I did the whole fucking day.

250
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:53.560
Diffuse and shit.
As I watched the red sox then go down,
you know,

251
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.270
four to nothing.

252
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.530
And after that crazy fucking game and game three

253
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.890
where we used our starting,
you know,
gain for pitcher.

254
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.400
I mean what,
what,
what?
I mean how great a game did a,

255
00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:13.420
what's his face Bueller pitch?
I feel like people forgot about that.

256
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.930
With the Dodgers winning,
it was all about that guy hitting the home run.

257
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.790
I apologize.
I've got a kid now.
I don't know anybody's fucking names anymore.

258
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.440
I watched the games while I fucking switch back and forth between the game and

259
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:27.640
puppy dog pals.
Every time I switched from puppy dog pals back to the game.

260
00:14:27.641 --> 00:14:32.170
My daughter just points at the TV goes,
oh,
oh dog,
dog,

261
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.670
dog.
And I got to
Mike.
Just a second.

262
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.590
Mimi Mau.
Mimi Mau.

263
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.860
It sounds like she's speaking like Chinese is something she's saying.

264
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.160
Minnie mouse.
Mimi Mile,
Mimi Mau,

265
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.470
Mimi Mau.
Um,
anyways,
so

266
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.790
I don't even know who hit the fucking home run.
The whole thing was such a blur.

267
00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:56.230
I've been so goddamn busy.

268
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.040
Somebody hit a fucking Omer and for the red sox to make it three nothing,

269
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.330
I mean four to three,

270
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.210
then we scored another run and then we fucking loaded them up.

271
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.450
And then that whole analytics shit that taking guys out there are doing a good

272
00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:09.370
job.
I don't fucking understand.

273
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.360
I mean analytics when in those situations sometimes I swear to God it's like,

274
00:15:13.361 --> 00:15:16.630
it's like baseball's version of the fucking prevent defense where you're like,

275
00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:19.210
I am sure on paper this fucking makes sense.

276
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.100
But uh,
why I,
you know,
stop watching the fucking pitch count.

277
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:29.880
What is this guy doing
to the opposite team right now?

278
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.850
Oh,
he's,
he sees,
she's fucking killing them.
Buddies up to 27 pitches and,

279
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.920
and the juxtaposition for tis ball and socket joint out fucking shoulder to his,

280
00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:41.400
his,
his juggler.

281
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.540
We need to take them out during the 28th and a half fucking pitch right there

282
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:48.690
doing that shit.
So anyways,
we end up coming back.

283
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.761
I think we won that.

284
00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:55.320
We were winning the game like nine to four and then Kimbro comes in,
you know,

285
00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:58.480
you know how he closes the game.
He lets up a column run in a fucking double for,

286
00:15:58.481 --> 00:16:03.150
you know,
I know he's coming off an injury.
God bless the guy.
Whatever.

287
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.390
He scared the fucking shit out of me.
And uh,

288
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.780
we won the game and then it was great.
I got to walk on to the stadium.

289
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.470
I didn't have any problem.
I shook the guy's hand behind me and you,

290
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.580
I know I saw a bunch of people wearing red shit there.
Um,
I guess what I'm not,

291
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:17.760
I'm just too old to do it.

292
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.630
And my favorite fucking part about going to an opposing team stadium

293
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.680
rooting for the other team is when I'm not wearing my own gear and I go into the

294
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:31.550
bathroom and I don't have to worry that five guys are going to push me in the

295
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:34.580
back when I go to take a fucking piss.
You know what I mean?

296
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.900
Cause their teams lose it and the the,
the,

297
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.320
the fucking bathroom with all of that porcelain,

298
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:41.210
all of that tile and none of that,

299
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:43.670
none of the fucking security and his urine on the floor.

300
00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:47.480
It's just the fucking worst.
And that's,
that's where it goes down.

301
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.340
And to just be able to walk in there and just not have a fucking problem.

302
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.820
I wasn't being a dick when the red sox were scoring runs.

303
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.850
I was definitely chairman,
but I did it in a respectful way.

304
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.090
I didn't do that shit.
I always see that.
And when I'm watching games,
you know,

305
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.990
any game,
any game I watch and I'll see the opposing team's score.

306
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:08.450
When they cut to the crowd,
you'll always see one douchebag,

307
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.100
not only standing up wearing fucking everything he could possibly be wearing for

308
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:16.370
the other team.
He's turning around facing the crowd,

309
00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.770
you know,
like he's fucking,
you know,

310
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.340
Steven Seagal and marked for death and he's going to beat up a whole fucking

311
00:17:23.341 --> 00:17:27.840
section though,
is some fucking fat,
bloated drunk jackass.

312
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.520
And every time I see it,

313
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.640
I always just think like somebody should beat the fuck out of that guy.

314
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.300
Somebody shouldn't,
but you know,

315
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.290
<v 3>okay.</v>

316
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.230
<v 1>You never watch the discovery channel,
you don't know how nature works.
Like what?</v>

317
00:17:41.231 --> 00:17:42.580
Yeah,
just no fucking

318
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.950
<v 3>okay.</v>

319
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.840
<v 1>I Dunno what,
no.
Uh,
no respect for like your own wellbeing.</v>

320
00:17:48.841 --> 00:17:51.720
Like the fuck,
why the fuck would you do that?
So anyways,

321
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:53.460
that's just not how I did it.

322
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:56.460
So then I got home and it was late at night and we would just sit in there like,

323
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:58.920
can you fucking believe this shit?
It was like we were down four to nothing.

324
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.780
I wasn't even nervous cause I was thinking even if the Dodgers tied the series

325
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:06.840
up was still going to win it.
Like that's how much a psychology,

326
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:08.910
and I'm talking about the fucking Boston red sox.

327
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.330
I never thought I would have this feeling about it,

328
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:13.890
but I just knew these guys were gonna come back.

329
00:18:13.891 --> 00:18:15.660
I didn't think it was going to happen in that game.

330
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.510
And we won that game and I just couldn't fucking believe it.

331
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.860
And I didn't talk one ounce of fucking shit.
None of that stuff.
I just,
you know,

332
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.240
I wanted my team to win.
They won.
That was good enough for me.

333
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.500
I don't need to fucking start walking around being a cunt about it,

334
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.590
but like that's really,
um,
it just really is just sort of sparked part of the,
uh,

335
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.590
sports culture.
And what's funny is,

336
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.950
is how people don't see that their own fans of their team do it too.

337
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.800
Like I know when the red sox were playing New York,

338
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:51.720
New York for whatever stupid fucking reason in the locker room after we won it,

339
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.940
it was all these Yankee fans

340
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.140
<v 0>go real close.
You could tell you this with the yogis would listing,</v>

341
00:18:57.141 --> 00:19:01.100
we'll be doing is thinking about the red sox.
It's like,
yeah,
you will be.

342
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:07.020
<v 1>Yes she will be because you took the time to go on Twitter to fucking comment on</v>

343
00:19:07.031 --> 00:19:09.700
that.
You took the time to find out about it.

344
00:19:09.701 --> 00:19:13.630
You're obviously on the in in the red sox threads to see it,

345
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.910
you know,
and then they all real classy Boston like and just like,
hey,

346
00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:21.310
you're really forgetting that your fan base through a bear in the face of our

347
00:19:21.311 --> 00:19:23.230
reliever is he came out of the bullpen,

348
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:28.000
you're going to forget your chanted 1918 at fucking old ladies.

349
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.120
If they had a red sox hat on for the better part of a fucking century may come

350
00:19:32.121 --> 00:19:34.450
on,
grow the fuck up.
It's not something I would do.

351
00:19:34.451 --> 00:19:38.290
I think it's dumb to do that cause it just,
uh,
you know,

352
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.310
gives the other team more incentive or whatever.
But,
uh,

353
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.060
personally speaking,
um,

354
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.670
all I give a shit about is my team.
And like now I'm out of,

355
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.260
the big thing is I would love to see the red sox winning again.

356
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.800
So then we would be in double digits in,

357
00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.730
in Champions Championships in two different professional sports,

358
00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:03.400
basketball and um,

359
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.290
and a and baseball.
And I think we would be the first city that ever did that.

360
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:14.020
Um,
not to mention,
here's another stat if you into fucking stats.

361
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.160
I also believe that the red sox or the first professional sports franchise to

362
00:20:18.161 --> 00:20:22.970
win a championship the same year in two different centuries.
Huh?

363
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:28.150
Am I going fucking Billy Ball on your hair,
a little nerd enough for you.
Um,

364
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.831
and lastly,

365
00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:32.470
but not leastly I can't remember cause I had to start this podcast again cause

366
00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:34.960
my record record,
it was filled up.
If I did and I don't give a shit,

367
00:20:34.961 --> 00:20:38.860
I'll apologize.
So again,
my apologies to David Price.

368
00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.043
Jesus Christ

369
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.980
<v 0>not have been more wrong and there's going to be a bunch of people out there</v>

370
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:47.070
being like,
dude,
I fucking sad and I know what,

371
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.370
I never doubted that guy above.
They are full of Shit.
You're full.

372
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:52.990
I'm maybe not,
but I did.

373
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.980
I 100% thought I actually thought we weren't going to win it and the problem was

374
00:20:56.981 --> 00:21:00.580
going to be that David Price was a headcase,
couldn't beat the Yankees,

375
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:04.900
couldn't win the big game,
couldn't win fucking October.
I 100% thought that.

376
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.150
Um,
and I was like,
you know,
you need the one two punch,
you need,
you know,

377
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.480
you need to monster shut it down.

378
00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.030
Pitchers to win a seven game series.

379
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:20.170
Now that's how it is with all the free agents seemingly piling on six different

380
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:24.190
teams and I was 100% wrong.
I actually thought,

381
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:25.481
you know,

382
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:30.100
price should have been the MVP considering all of that fucking chatter that was

383
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:34.960
in his ear and considering,
you know,
he won both his starts,

384
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.920
he came in during the pitch relief and eat up some meetings and he just,

385
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.720
he just crushed it and uh,

386
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.470
couldn't be more happy for that guy and couldn't be more happy that I was 100%

387
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.800
wrong,
100% wrong.
And I loved his,

388
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:51.610
when he is his press conference afterwards,
when he was going,
you know,

389
00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:55.180
you guys had that card on me and you played it,
you played it well,

390
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:59.320
but you don't have it anymore.
He goes,
I have the Trump card and it feels great.

391
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.790
And I just pushed one of those sports writers in there,
you know,

392
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.280
they never fucking own up when they're fucking wrong,
you know,

393
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.570
or at least not enough.
They should,
one of them should have been like,
Hey David,

394
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.440
how feel,

395
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.180
how good does it feel to stare at all of us who fucking doubted you and wrote

396
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:20.020
all that bad shit about you,
myself included.
You know,

397
00:22:20.021 --> 00:22:24.730
why don't they ever say that?
You know?
So anyways,
um,

398
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.320
I dunno,
but getting back to that stuff,
I would not have played New York,

399
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:32.440
New York.
I would not like,
why would you do that?
You,

400
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.620
you fucking kicked the Yankees ass.
You know,

401
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.010
you've got to be above that shit.
But I guess there's always that stuff.

402
00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:43.090
You go to a rangers game and the range is still chant.
Pod Sucks.

403
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.770
I go to an avalanche game,
but at,
at,
at dead dead red wig suck.

404
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:51.390
You just have your fucking rival.
Um,

405
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.820
and I guess I understand it because Yankee fans were such con for so Goddamn

406
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:02.320
Long.
Um,
I guess they understand it,
but,
uh,
I'm always,
I'm always,

407
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.600
I always think it's way better to score the touchdown and just hand the ball to

408
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:10.300
the ref.
You do some stupid dance.

409
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:13.540
All it does is fucking make the guy covering you.

410
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.370
I don't know,

411
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.080
just want to fucking play that much harder if you just do it like it wasn't

412
00:23:20.081 --> 00:23:23.980
shit.
I just feel like it's just way more defeating.

413
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.870
But what do I know?
You know,
moves last time bill,

414
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:31.450
you play the game and fucking gym class.
I'm trying to think.

415
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:34.420
The last time I played other than hockey and played hockey in three years,

416
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.040
so I hurt my back and then I had a kid,
so I,

417
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:39.690
my hockey stuff has just been sitting there every time I walked by,
I was like,

418
00:23:39.691 --> 00:23:43.270
I have not,
I remember September of 2015 I haven't skated in three fucking years.

419
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.350
Pathetic.
Um,
but anyways,
uh,
so congratulations to the red sox.

420
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.550
Congratulations to the Dodgers,
man.
I know it fucking brutal,
but uh,

421
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:57.500
it will be all the more sweeter when you finally,
uh,
pushed through and um,

422
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.520
you know,
getting past all this fan shit like I really do.

423
00:24:01.521 --> 00:24:03.950
Like all of those organizations that we played,

424
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:06.590
including the fucking Yankees mean you can't get mad at the most successful.

425
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.950
You know,
you can't be a fan of sports in that respect.

426
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:12.920
What the fuck they'd done a and it with that.
That's it.

427
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:17.060
I'm done talking about it.
The Patriots got the bills tonight.
Hey,

428
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:21.290
did Lewis Hamilton wrap it up yesterday?
Danny,
I imagine he fucking,

429
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.460
he's always on the podium.

430
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.970
I think all he needed to do is just get into like fourth or fifth place and he

431
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:30.770
would have had it wrapped up.
Let's see.
Louis Hamilton.
Oh,

432
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:33.840
by the way,
thank you to everybody that came out to,
um,

433
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:35.670
<v 3>okay.</v>

434
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.000
<v 0>Why does it always go?
How come it always goes to Wikipedia?</v>

435
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.730
Is that because I always go to Wikipedia?

436
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.320
What did I already be up there when 71 is it,
does it die?

437
00:24:47.321 --> 00:24:51.730
Whereas championships,
Yup.
He just wanted 2018 he wanted again.

438
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.300
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

439
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.540
Um,
so Lewis Hamilton,

440
00:24:58.541 --> 00:25:03.541
when's the f one championship and Mark Mark Perez one the a moto GP race.

441
00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:07.690
And I want to thank everybody that has helped me along as I've gotten into both

442
00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:11.470
of those sports and I'm absolutely obsessed with them.
Although I've,
you know,

443
00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:13.900
like I said with the Kiddo,
I don't have as much time

444
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.133
<v 3>mmm.</v>

445
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.450
<v 0>To watch them the way I want to,
but they are on my DVR.
Um,</v>

446
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.530
what was,
it was in Brazil.
I was Mexico.

447
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.290
That's one of my favorite races where they drive to the old baseball stadium.

448
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.103
<v 3>MMM.</v>

449
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.110
<v 0>I am called to that one next year.
Who knows?
Who knows?</v>

450
00:25:33.111 --> 00:25:36.220
All I know is it's Halloween this weekend I'm in town and uh,

451
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.680
we're having this little kid Halloween party,
you know,

452
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.120
you know nightclubs,
so like,
you know,
21 and older.
I think this is like,

453
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.190
it's like 18 months and under.

454
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.680
So it was going to be a bunch of little kids running around.

455
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:49.850
It's going to be hilarious.

456
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.240
My wife is like totally decked out the house and everything.
Oh,
by the way,

457
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:54.470
when I came home after the game,

458
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.980
she was still upset with me and I didn't know that she was still up.

459
00:25:57.981 --> 00:26:01.400
So we were outside.
Yeah.
Smoking cigars and shit.
And she texted me,
she's like,

460
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:03.740
where are you?
I'm like,
I'm downstairs it back porch.

461
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:06.710
And she got all fucking mad at me.
Like she wasn't invited.

462
00:26:06.711 --> 00:26:10.850
So I went upstairs and I got tight.
She was so trying to have a fight with me.

463
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.390
I just wouldn't have a fight.
It was like,
listen,
I don't want to fight with you.

464
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:18.710
Just tell me what the problem is.
I love you.
You're awesome.
I love you.

465
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:21.860
You love me.
We're not going anywhere.
I don't want to go to bed angry at you.

466
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.560
What did I do that upset you?
And like,
how can we,

467
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:28.280
how can we work this out and just,
you know,
stop yelling at each other.

468
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:29.114
I don't want to yell at you.

469
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:30.540
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

470
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.960
<v 0>She says,
okay.
She had to go through that.
You know,
for one,</v>

471
00:26:34.961 --> 00:26:37.050
she was being the baby.
You know,

472
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.080
so that's my new thing.
I'm just,
I don't know what happened somewhere.

473
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.380
That dodger game,
I want to thank that guy who was standing mind me.

474
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.990
The absurdity of it.
It just finally hit me.

475
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:51.660
It's just like I'm not fucking doing it.
I'm just not doing this anymore.

476
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.550
Jesus Christ.
I just saw a fucking letter for this week.

477
00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:58.320
I'm copying and pasting it right now.

478
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.010
It just said girlfriend wants to bang my brother now that,
that,

479
00:27:04.011 --> 00:27:08.370
that just,
I refuse to believe that that's a true thing.
Whatever.

480
00:27:08.371 --> 00:27:09.330
I'll read that in a minute here.

481
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:12.900
I got to do the advertising was probably not a good thing to tease right before

482
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:17.480
I'm going to read advertising,
uh,
advertisements.
Um,

483
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.140
all right.
What the hell is it?
Oh in don't cheat.
Oh,
uh,

484
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.280
talk about stressful.
Talk about,

485
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.010
she'd say how stressful it is knowing you have to go to an event in his suit

486
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:32.400
that doesn't fit.
Oh yeah.
That's the worst I had to go to.

487
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:36.330
The reason why I didn't see any a game are clinching red sox game yet.

488
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.440
Cause I had to go to a wedding and we had the after the after party for season

489
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:43.980
three of 'em F is for family.

490
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.090
We had a great time.
We actually went bowling and a,

491
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:50.070
so I kind of do like double duty last night.

492
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:55.020
So I was watching that whole thing on my phone.
Um,
but anyways,

493
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.140
I love going to weddings now.
Now that I'm married and I have a kid,

494
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.140
it's like all the pressures over I did it.
Okay.

495
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.760
I committed to somebody I procreated,
you know,
fuck off.

496
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.080
I imagine it's the same feeling David Price has right now.
Okay,

497
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.480
I did it.
I got a ring.
Go Fuck Yourself.

498
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:21.070
I am the David Price of wedding wedding guests right now.

520
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.720
that's actually not true.
I'm actually in good shape right now,
but you know,

521
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.210
it's always good to have a big sport coat hanging around for one year.

522
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:58.580
You're going through your fat months,
you know the holidays.

So I make it a real thing.
I'm done with it.

What is the fucking problem?
What I really need to say?
I'm sorry.

What is the problem?
But I,

the only place I've graduated to right now is what is the fucking problem.

555
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.800
All right,
if I can take the fuck out of there,

556
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.830
get some of the angry tone out of my voice,
I think I'll be doing even better.

557
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.960
All right,
granted,
I'll probably run out of material,
but that's beside the point.

575
00:33:01.211 --> 00:33:03.420

We'll go live November 5th.
I have a,

578
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:15.050
I videoed a podcast.
It's a live podcast from Phoenix.

579
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.650
That was a good podcast to full video of the show as well as downloads to MP,

580
00:33:19.651 --> 00:33:23.480
three,
two episodes of uninformed and um,

582
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.290
Paisano behind the scenes shit at my shows and all that of stuff.

583
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.480
Um,
you know,

584
00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:35.780
it's funny they say don't you have a patriotic page and they don't even tell me.

585
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.950
I guess you go to Patrion and you'd just try to look up my name,
whatever.

586
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:42.850
I'll keep promoting,
I'll promote it.
And again,
speaking of which,
uh,

587
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:47.450
please watch on a,
what is it this week,
November 3rd,

588
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:50.200
Paul Versey standup special,
uh,

589
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.890
on comedy central is coming out and it was done by my,

590
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:59.780
uh,
my company that I started with Al Madrigal,
all things comedy.

591
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:01.610
This is our first special that is coming out.

592
00:34:01.611 --> 00:34:03.560
We're very excited and it would be you,

593
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.000
it would be huge this Thursday night if you guys could.
Uh,

594
00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.390
is that what it is?
Not on,
on.
I sat Thursday night looking at the wrong thing.

595
00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:14.100
Sunday night,
Sunday,
Sunday,

596
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.730
Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah.
No,
that's the wrong one too.

597
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:24.450
Why is it in May?
I swear to God,
don't,
don't even listen to me.

598
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.920
Here we go.
I'm sorry.
This Saturday night,
November 3rd,

599
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.070
Paul versus stand up special on comedy central.

600
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:36.540
I think it comes on at midnight.
Um,

601
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:38.610
<v 3>okay.</v>

602
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:39.750
<v 0>Yeah,
I'm just really proud of them.</v>

603
00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:42.480
This is just one of these guys who should have got a special a long time ago and

604
00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:45.690
did not end with the company that I started with.

605
00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:49.050
Al Madrigal add matter with Myalgia.
Go being the driving force behind it.

606
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.700
We're able to get ourselves in position.

607
00:34:50.701 --> 00:34:54.960
We actually made a deal with comedy central and we're producing,
um,

608
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:58.620
for one hour specials for them for the next year.
This is the first one.

609
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.600
And we're going to be picking all these comics that we love and I'm so please

610
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:06.060
check that out if you can.
All right,
let's,
let's read.

611
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.940
Let's read a little less questionnaire.
Corvette.

612
00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.380
Hey Billy Bean ball bag.
Uh,

613
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:16.980
need advice on a car I would love to purchase next year.
I'm looking to try a,

614
00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:20.340
trying to get a c seven corvette.

615
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.570
The latest model Corvettes.
A C seven.
Okay.

616
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.670
Or is that the bar?
Is that the body type?
Oh,
what do you do?
You know,

617
00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:31.300
look at that.
I can't fucking hear myself.
What just happened?

618
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.770
Gravity happened.
Nah,
I got to sit there and literally hold this thing.

619
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.590
I literally have my thumb down on the connection here.

620
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.400
Like one of those bad action movies where the guy comes walking and go on a
bike,

621
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:47.310
take my thumb off,
is paid.
We all go up.

622
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.880
I got to do that for the rest of the podcast.
Evidently.
Um,

623
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:56.110
so anyways,
so I imagine that's fucking shit.

624
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.400
Jesus fucking Christ.

625
00:35:59.401 --> 00:36:04.401
They'll go to a radio shack and just by what the fuck he need said at dealing

626
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:09.210
with this every week.
Fucking moron.
Hey,
you know what?

627
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:13.860
I'm also done getting mad at inanimate objects.
Children.

628
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:16.950
Rosa had a great bit about that.
And I remember listening to it going,

629
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:19.950
you know what?
I really should learn how to do that.
And I haven't.

630
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:23.640
And as far as I can tell,
he hasn't learned how to not do it either.
Anyways,
uh,

631
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.790
it's the latest model.
Corvettes.
I'm currently 23 years old,

632
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.430
married to an absolute fucking gem,

633
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.420
have a house with her and pay for everything we want.
Slash half.
Dude,

634
00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:35.280
you're fucking killing it.
Uh,

635
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:38.520
not trying to pat myself on the back,

636
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.040
but I'm happy with where I am in life anyways.

637
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.060
Do you think it would be good or dumb idea to get a corvette next year and I'm

638
00:36:45.061 --> 00:36:47.790
going to be a little bitch and get an automatic.

639
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.480
I want to be able to have my mom drive it since that's her dream car.

640
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.270
Otherwise I would just get a manual anyways.

641
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.130
Don't go fuck yourself and keep on keeping on.
Um,
dude,

642
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.820
if you know you're married to a gem and you're living within your means,

643
00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:06.710
if you can afford to get a corvette,
get a corvette,
you know,
here's the deal.

644
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.790
I don't know if they make it in a stick still.

645
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:12.390
It seems like everything is just the paddle shifting.
Um,

646
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.080
if you still can get it into stick and he'd be a great way to teach your mom how

647
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:19.770
to drive a stick.
She grinds the gears on your brand new corvette.

648
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.180
Probably a dumb idea.
Sounded good in my head until I fucking said that.
Um,

649
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.330
although I tell you one of the big things then in the future that I want to do

650
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:29.460
with my daughters,
I want to teach her how to drive my truck,

651
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:34.350
which is three on the column.
And um,
I think,
yeah,
how bad ass will that be?

652
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.570
That she,
you know,

653
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:41.750
that someone born in 2017 we'll know how to drive a 1968 Ford f 100 and she's a

654
00:37:42.391 --> 00:37:46.560
lady.
Yeah.
My Kid's going to be a bad ass.
She's going to know how to do shit.

655
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.110
She's not gonna be when these fucking pretty girl sitting at the bar link.

656
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:53.100
I'm just going to pretend I don't know things.
Um,

657
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:59.130
anyways.
Yeah,
I think that's a great idea.
If you want to get,
you know,
if,

658
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.980
you know,
she,
she seems like he kind of also doing it for your mom,

659
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:06.690
which is a great thing.
Um,
man cars,

660
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:09.960
you know,
I dunno when people are like car people,

661
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.790
it really means a lot when they,
they get the one that they've always wanted.
Um,

662
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.200
you know,
I dunno,
I have bought,
I bought a car,
you know,

663
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:24.720
I bought the car my wife wanted and I saw the look on her face so I can imagine,

664
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:26.430
you know,
and that's the woman that I'm married,

665
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:27.930
so I know what that feeling's life.

666
00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:30.870
I can't imagine if you get it for your mom in,

667
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:33.750
you're able to pay her back like that.
Yeah,
absolutely.
I would fucking do that.

668
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.233
Um,

669
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:40.010
why don't you go buy a shit box in the meantime,

670
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:44.100
that's a stick and go teach your mom how to drive,
drive,

671
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.520
drive a standard transmission.
Be Great together time.

672
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:53.110
You'll laugh your asses off and uh,
you know,

673
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:56.770
and that's great for how somebody who's older to learn something new.

674
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.650
It's a lot of options here,
man.
Men are all good.

675
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.240
Glad you're life is in that place at that email actually made,
made me happy.

676
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:08.730
Believe it or not,
somebody killing it like that.
See that I got a good hat.

677
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.190
All right,
girlfriend wants to bang my brother.
Ah,
we,

678
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:14.410
I teased this earlier in the podcast.

679
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.370
Girlfriend wants to Bang

680
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.140
my brother,
Jesus Christ.

681
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.390
I would love to hear Joel Olsteen read this fucking thing.
I mean,

682
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.880
Jesus wants your girlfriend or bang your brother.
Uh,
hey bill,

683
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.330
I'm sure this happens.
This has happened to you before.

684
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:39.520
Is that a long roundabout way of saying that I'm not a good looking guy,

685
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.930
but how should I handle my girlfriend wanting to bang my brother more than me?

686
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.380
Thoughts?
She said it three times in one night.

687
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:48.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

688
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.750
<v 0>What,
why are you still in this relationship?</v>

689
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

690
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.160
<v 0>Would you still be in the relationship if you said that about our says,</v>

691
00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:02.760
hey,
listen sweetheart,
not to say you don't have a nice rack,
but like,

692
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.970
I mean you,
you got to agree with me.
I mean your,

693
00:40:05.971 --> 00:40:08.250
your sister's tits are ridiculous.

694
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.330
Do you know how bad I want to stick my dick between the two of them?

695
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.810
You know what,
what,
what's okay.
You told me to be honest with you.

696
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.230
Um,
um,
anyway,

697
00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.520
she said it in one night,

698
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:27.180
three times in one night and that he is better looking,
et cetera.

699
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.220
So she's either going to fuck him or she's just trying to get under my skin.

700
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:37.980
I told her after the third time to go fuck him then and she tried to act like I

701
00:40:37.981 --> 00:40:41.760
was an asshole.
Yes,
of course.
Of course she did.

702
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.960
I feel like this cross the line and it's all I can think about.

703
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:47.300
<v 3>Okay.</v>

704
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.160
<v 0>Oh Dude,
I got to tell you something right now.</v>

705
00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.940
Not only do you say that you fucking dumper

706
00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:59.480
for her to fucking say that to you is so out of line and that is just the tip of

707
00:40:59.481 --> 00:41:02.960
the fucking iceberg of the mind.
Games a fucking asshole.

708
00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:05.810
Like this is going to play with somebody.
All right,

709
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.680
dump this person and this is the thing she's going to have actually fucking

710
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.390
respects you because she obviously doesn't respect you enough that she's saying

711
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:16.610
that shit to you.
So if you fucking dumper,

712
00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:21.500
you know what's going to actually make her want to do is fuck you more.

713
00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.820
And this is what you do.
This is the jet I level.
You know what?

714
00:41:25.821 --> 00:41:28.730
When she wants to fuck you more after that,
you know what you do yet.

715
00:41:28.731 --> 00:41:31.280
Dot fucker done.

716
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.730
<v 3>Done.
It's over.</v>

717
00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.550
<v 0>That's one of those things like,</v>

718
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:43.260
I don't know what kind of a fucking jerk off you think I am like that.

719
00:41:43.261 --> 00:41:44.820
That's basically what she's saying to you there.

720
00:41:44.821 --> 00:41:48.000
She thinks you're a fucking jerk off and you have to show her that you're not.

721
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:52.320
I would dumper and then that is fucking it.
That is fucking it.

722
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.540
And when she fucking,
um,

723
00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:00.340
does all of those women manipulating things and fucking turns on the sex vibe

724
00:42:00.341 --> 00:42:03.580
and all that dude,
you fucking,
you like nothing.

725
00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.240
You give her nothing.

726
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

727
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.930
<v 0>That's it.
I don't need to read the rest of this.
I will though.
Um,</v>

728
00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:15.520
if it was a friend of mine,
she thought was more attractive,
I wouldn't care.

729
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.910
You should care.
She shouldn't be saying that,
dude.
This is,

730
00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:22.240
this is why you don't fucking say that.
Let me ask you this.

731
00:42:22.241 --> 00:42:25.120
Could you do any of this to her?
Could you say that one of her,

732
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.830
her girlfriends is more attractive than her three times in one night.

733
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.810
Anyways,
he said,
but I hate the fact it's my baldheaded fuck of a brother.

734
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.710
What should I do?
Anything I think about,
I get more angry.

735
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:42.670
Uh,
thanks and wear a hat next.

736
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.950
I'm like,
are you taking your anger out on me?
Um,
yeah,
dude.

737
00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.700
You're dating somebody that has crossed the line that you're not going to be

738
00:42:51.701 --> 00:42:55.690
able to get past.
Okay.
Pass.
Sorry.
Am I really going to save my voice?
Dude?

739
00:42:55.691 --> 00:42:59.800
I've been screaming and yelling every weekend doing my act and been watching the

740
00:42:59.801 --> 00:43:03.070
red sox through the playoffs.
So I apologize for my son.

741
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.670
I'm going through puberty here.
Oh yeah.
Dude,
that is a no fucking brainer,

742
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.373
<v 3>you know?</v>

743
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.690
<v 0>Uh,
just dumper and it's another thing.</v>

744
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:15.620
Don't tell your older brother or younger brother,
whoever your brother is.
Don't,

745
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.170
don't tell your brother why you dumped it.

746
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.230
Because one day he's going to get drunk.
He's going to bring it up and then,

747
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.290
you know,
like an asshole and then you guys are gonna get to a fight.
Okay?

748
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.450
And it's all because of this,

749
00:43:26.451 --> 00:43:31.430
this cunt who is trying is driving a wedge into your family.
This is,

750
00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:33.860
this is the kind of person you're going to bring this person into the a family

751
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:34.694
trait.

752
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:35.803
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

753
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.560
<v 0>You're going to dump your fucking seat into that.
I don't think you are.</v>

754
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.590
Walk away.
Walk away.
And you know what,
Dude,

755
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:47.490
you got off fucking easy.
If you dumped this woman right now,

756
00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:51.240
you got off fucking easy.
Jesus Christ.

757
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:56.450
God bless the poor fucking bastard that she's going to fucking marry right

758
00:43:56.551 --> 00:44:01.380
there.
Um,
anyways,
uh,
deer hill,
Billy Buck tooth.

759
00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.790
Uh,
I'm in a bit of a pickle.
I'm 23 letters,
lot of,

760
00:44:05.791 --> 00:44:09.810
lot of emails from 23 year olds this week.
Evidently a 23 year olds.

761
00:44:09.811 --> 00:44:13.530
I haven't have a,
a little difficult fucking time here.
Um,

762
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:18.660
deer hill,
Billy Buck tooth,
uh,
um,
a bit of an m and a bit of a pickle.

763
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.650
I'm 23 and want to break up with my girlfriend of two years.

764
00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.340
We're long distance.
I'm a kiwi.
She's a Yank.

765
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:32.760
Oh,
what's a Kiwi again?
Is that fucking New Zealand?
I can't,
I can't even keep up.

766
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.460
Um,
anyways,
uh,
now I gotta look it up.

767
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.390
I don't want you guys to sound ignorant like me.
Here we go.

768
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:45.920
Key we p Bowl Wikipedia.

769
00:44:45.921 --> 00:44:46.880
Once again,

770
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.970
Kiwi is a nickname used for international internationally for people from New

771
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.780
Zealand,
as well as being relatively common.

772
00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.530
Self-Reference unlike many demograph flavor,

773
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.600
its uses is not considered offensive,
rather,

774
00:45:02.601 --> 00:45:06.470
it's generally viewed as a symbol of pride and an endearment from,

775
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:10.190
for the people of New Zealand.
The name derives from the Kiwi,

776
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:15.020
a native flightless bird,
which is a national symbol of New Zealand.

777
00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.690
It's a flightless bird,
man.
He,
you guys aren't leaving the island.

778
00:45:17.691 --> 00:45:19.730
Is that what it is?
Until the first world war,

779
00:45:19.731 --> 00:45:23.600
the Kiwi representative the country and not the people.
However,
by 1917,

780
00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.920
New Zealanders were being called Kiwis supplanting other nicknames.

781
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.440
Well that's cool.
It's great that eventually it didn't become offensive.

782
00:45:30.441 --> 00:45:31.850
Usually after a while it does.

783
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:36.830
Are you saying that my dreams will never take flight?

784
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.330
<v 3>Ooh.</v>

785
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:43.870
<v 0>Um,
anyways.
Uh,
I'm a kiwi.
Eat,</v>

786
00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:44.704
she's a yank.

787
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.230
<v 3>Uh,</v>

788
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.760
<v 0>sure.
Blocker on Facebook.
Okay.</v>

789
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:52.220
I'm 23 and want to break up with my girlfriend at two years.
Okay,

790
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:57.170
well you just sit down.
He just say,
listen,
we have to talk.
All right.

791
00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:59.780
This is something that I wish somebody just told me.
This is what you say,

792
00:45:59.781 --> 00:46:03.890
you just sit down to see,
honey,
listen,
we have to talk.
Is something wrong?

793
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.300
And then you just say,
yes,
I'm just,
I'm not happy.

794
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.990
Okay.
I don't think you're a bad person or anything,
but I'm just,

795
00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:14.850
<v 3>okay,</v>

796
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.340
<v 0>this just doesn't feel right.</v>

797
00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.773
<v 3>You know,</v>

798
00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.580
<v 0>it feels right in that I like you,</v>

799
00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:26.930
but it doesn't feel like I like you to the point that I'm going to marry you.

800
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:30.330
And then they just stopped talking and said,

801
00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.170
and then she'll start fucking crying and blah,
blah,
blah.

802
00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.840
And she's crying because she's sad.

803
00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.470
And that is a normal emotion and you have to be comfortable with that.

804
00:46:39.471 --> 00:46:43.670
And just you,
you just said it.
No.
Did you say?
Yeah,
no.
And I,
I,

805
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.740
I think we need to,
uh,
end this relationship now,
I think,

806
00:46:48.741 --> 00:46:52.130
and we need to end this relationship.
That's it.
He said it,
I'm not happy.

807
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.410
I'm not feeling like you're the person I'm going to marry.

808
00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.210
We need to end this relationship.
Boom,
boom,
boom.
We need to talk.
I'm not happy.

809
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:03.200
Yeah,
you just fucking,
that's it.
And you just get it all out.

810
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.980
And it's going to be another two fucking hours,
but you don't waver.

811
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:10.190
You don't go back and then,
then you're out.

812
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:14.800
That's it.
And then you go back.

813
00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.750
Anyways,
he says,
sure.

814
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.610
Blocker on block her on Facebook and other social medias.

815
00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:27.950
We used to correspond.
The problem is she has a lot of filthy nudes of mine.

816
00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:32.050
I've sent her over the past few years.
Needless to say,

817
00:47:32.051 --> 00:47:35.350
I have my fair share of hers.
All right,
well that's a stalemate then.

818
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:39.550
I'm worried she'll distribute them maliciously and revenge for breaking it off

819
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:42.550
with her.
She's that kind of spiteful.
Trust me.

820
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.180
Any advice other than hindsight,
thanks and go fuck yourself.

821
00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.390
You can just going to have to man up and do it,
dude.
You know?

822
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.960
And if the world's going to see a dick for a couple of days,
then so be it.

823
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.410
<v 3>That's it.
That's it.</v>

824
00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.890
<v 0>All right.
And um,</v>

825
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.180
I'm actually happy for you because who wants to be,

826
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.660
who would want to marry a spiteful person

827
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.430
because she,

828
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.420
she would have done that to you if you stayed with their in other areas.

829
00:48:13.421 --> 00:48:15.310
You're not happy.
Get the fuck out of it.

830
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:18.580
And then your hindsight stop sending Dick Pics to people,

831
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:21.703
you know.

832
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.650
<v 3>Okay.</v>

833
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:27.080
<v 0>I Dunno.
That's,
that's how I lead that way.</v>

834
00:48:27.081 --> 00:48:29.510
What do you have a fucking lay in there?
Like Burt Reynolds in playgirl?

835
00:48:29.511 --> 00:48:33.200
Cause if you weren't covering your junk,
I don't understand.

836
00:48:33.201 --> 00:48:35.830
Like I understand women cause they're beautiful.
I just don't understand.

837
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.180
I don't understand.
Understand guys doing that.
Uh,

838
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.680
you like these dick and balls hanging off here.

839
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.050
Um,
a naked guy.

840
00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:52.800
It's like literally it looks like it's like a design flaw.

841
00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.650
You know,
women are all curvy.
It's smooth and aerodynamic,
you know,

842
00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:00.630
other went to the point,
other women can look at other naked women and be like,

843
00:49:00.631 --> 00:49:04.980
oh my God,
she's beautiful.
You know what I mean?
A naked guy,
you know.
Ah,

844
00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:09.900
it's Craig,
you're fucking this shit hanging off.
Cover it up.
Um,

845
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.210
dilemma a,
hey bill,

846
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.650
I'm writing in as another female listener going on six years now.

847
00:49:16.651 --> 00:49:19.530
Love your work and I'm hoping you can help me decide something.
I right.

848
00:49:19.531 --> 00:49:24.030
I love when the ladies right in.
I'm 18,
just turned 18.
All right.

849
00:49:24.031 --> 00:49:26.040
She's legal.
Uh,

850
00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:30.030
and I've been working at an estate firm for three years.
Look at you.

851
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.050
Good for you.
I even know what that is,
but that sounds impressive to me.
Um,

852
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.510
I'm a sophomore in college.
How are you only 18 years old doing all this stuff?

853
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.950
You're like advanced classes.

854
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.820
Most people who could play the cello when you were three.
Uh,
I'm on a sophomore.

855
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:49.290
I'm a sophomore in college pursuing a criminal degree.

856
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.410
Then going on to law school.

857
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.470
I've always wanted to be a criminal defense attorney.
Well,

858
00:49:55.471 --> 00:49:59.310
let's say you're going to make that happen by the time you're like 21.
Anyways.

859
00:49:59.311 --> 00:50:02.670
However,
the lady I work for who runs the estate from once,

860
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:04.100
<v 3>yeah,</v>

861
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.570
<v 0>to pass the firm to me,</v>

862
00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:11.140
but I never intended to pursue a career in a state law by dilemmas seems to be,

863
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:16.630
I can't decide whether I should accept this overwhelmingly kind offer of the

864
00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:21.500
estate from ready for me when I graduate law school or start from scratch at the

865
00:50:21.501 --> 00:50:25.160
bottom and criminal law.
The estate firm would need some work.

866
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.280
But all in all is a business.

867
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.730
From listening to your story of how you are a self made man.

868
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:35.480
I would assume you would say pick criminal if that's what you've always wanted.

869
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:40.490
But who in their right mind turns down a firm that's wrapped and ready with

870
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:43.760
their name on it?
Looking forward to your insight.
Uh,

871
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:46.280
you make rush hour drives bearable.
Thanks.

872
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:51.350
And kindly go fuck yourself from another broad.
Alright.

873
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.790
Jesus Christ,
is this like the coolest person ever.
She's 18.
She's crushing it.

874
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.410
Um,
listen,

875
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.140
<v 3>okay.</v>

876
00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:03.730
<v 0>You're an amazingly successful person for 18 years of age and I would look at it</v>

877
00:51:03.731 --> 00:51:06.370
like this,
the state from,
it's just,
you know,

878
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.570
it's like when Columbus was sailing across the ocean before he saw land,

879
00:51:10.571 --> 00:51:13.250
it was a couple of tree branches.
So that's what's coming here.

880
00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:14.140
You seeing that your,

881
00:51:14.141 --> 00:51:17.650
your big things come and you can definitely go do what the fuck you want to do.

882
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:22.000
Um,
I think you'll regret way more.

883
00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:23.810
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

884
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:27.530
<v 0>Not trying to be in the part of law that you wanted to be,</v>

885
00:51:27.531 --> 00:51:32.330
and then walking away from some money because,

886
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:37.140
uh,
you know,
you know,
the money,
the money makes money,

887
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.840
makes you like relaxed as far as like,
he can pay your bills and shit like that,

888
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:46.120
but it doesn't do anything for,
for like your soul or your heart.

889
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.160
You know what I mean?
Your passions,
it just doesn't,

890
00:51:48.161 --> 00:51:51.530
unless your passion is you love fucking money,
um,

891
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.710
you know,
whatever the fuck that is.
Uh,
so yeah,

892
00:51:55.711 --> 00:51:59.100
I would definitely just stay on the track that you're on.

893
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

894
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.450
<v 0>And you know,
just tell the person,
I am obviously ridiculously flattered,</v>

895
00:52:04.451 --> 00:52:05.530
but you know,

896
00:52:05.531 --> 00:52:09.670
my dream since I've been little has been to be a criminal defense attorney.

897
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.010
That's the direction that's the part of law I want to be in.

898
00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:17.460
And I just know that I would have this regret while I ran your state from,

899
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:23.370
and your state from deserves somebody that has the same level of passion for a

900
00:52:23.711 --> 00:52:25.780
state law is I do for criminal law.

901
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:29.290
And there you said it and the person is going to sit down.

902
00:52:29.291 --> 00:52:32.070
They're going to start crying.
No kidding.
You know,

903
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.070
it's like really like this should be a course on how to break up with somebody

904
00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:41.200
and then also how to have confrontations like this anywhere from the fat guy yet

905
00:52:41.201 --> 00:52:44.980
yet behind you at a baseball game to somebody offering you something that nobody

906
00:52:44.981 --> 00:52:49.240
would say no to,
but your,
your heart is saying,
I can't do this.
Um,

907
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:50.240
<v 3>okay.</v>

908
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.020
<v 0>And that's it.
And the thing about it is,</v>

909
00:52:52.021 --> 00:52:56.310
is what you have to learn as a young person is you have to learn that this,

910
00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.410
this is one of the biggest,
biggest skills in life is learning how to have,

911
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.320
um,
productive confrontation.

912
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:06.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

913
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.570
<v 0>All right.
Where you express what you want and you get what you want.</v>

914
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.310
Or at the very least you stated what you want.

915
00:53:12.311 --> 00:53:15.760
If you're not getting what you want,
you walk,
but you don't do it.

916
00:53:15.761 --> 00:53:18.640
There's no name calling.
There's no raising of voices.

917
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:22.270
And even if the other person goes there,
you don't match their energy.

918
00:53:22.271 --> 00:53:26.340
You just let them yell and stuff like that and you just comp,

919
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:31.990
um,
they,
they,
they should,
I don't know.
I'm sure somebody is doing that out there,

920
00:53:31.991 --> 00:53:35.640
but they just don't do it enough.
And um,

921
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:42.060
you know,
I turned a corner the other night with my wife where I,
you know,

922
00:53:42.061 --> 00:53:44.760
I didn't go to where our energy was.

923
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:48.450
I understood why she was upset with me and I told her she was right.

924
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.250
You are right.
I didn't come home and ask you how you were doing.
You're right.

925
00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:56.990
I apologize for that.
I work on that.
But like I don't want to yell at you.

926
00:53:56.991 --> 00:53:59.400
I love you.
That's it.
I mean,

927
00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:03.470
what the fuck is someone going to do with that Kevin,
yet that you love me then?

928
00:54:03.471 --> 00:54:05.510
And he just,
he just sounds stupid.
And women,

929
00:54:05.511 --> 00:54:08.970
fortunately enough or rational enough that you can kind of talk,
come down,

930
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:14.430
you know,
we're guys,
you know,
like I don't want to deal with my emotions.

931
00:54:14.431 --> 00:54:16.350
You don't,
you just go for a fucking butterfly,
new thing.
Then I go,
okay,

932
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:21.350
go for a walk.
You know,
I go for a walk,
I go out to my garage,

933
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.290
I played drums,
couple of Pantera songs,

934
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.840
and I've just lost myself in that.

935
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.600
And then I come back and I can just sit,
you know,

936
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:35.130
it's a little weird that someone in the middle of a fucking discussion has to go

937
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:37.920
on and go play to some van Halen and then come back before they can be.

938
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.450
But you know,
I,
you know,
I have some growing up to do,
but whatever.
Um,
so that,

939
00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:46.830
yeah,
that's what I would do.
And you know,
I eat,
if you do an all of this already,

940
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:49.250
like this is not going to be the last opportunity.

941
00:54:49.251 --> 00:54:53.190
And how much better would it be if you built your own firm?
You know,

942
00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:57.370
I think that'd be pretty bad ass.
All right.
But do whatever you want to do.

943
00:54:57.371 --> 00:55:00.400
But that,
that's my,
that's my feeling.
Sorry,
withdrawals.

944
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.330
I been listening to the podcast since the first episode.

945
00:55:04.331 --> 00:55:09.040
This is my third day off of opiates.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

946
00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:09.941
Uh,

947
00:55:09.941 --> 00:55:14.140
I've been on pain manage a pain management scheduled for the last five years due

948
00:55:14.141 --> 00:55:17.260
to arthritis in my spine.
MMM.

949
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:21.030
Eating painkiller after painkiller for the last five years.

950
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.780
Eventually I got to the point where I was starting to question if I was addicted

951
00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:29.900
or not.
Every time I took a pain killer,

952
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.420
he kind of skipped a few words there,
but you're going through withdrawals.

953
00:55:33.421 --> 00:55:36.260
The fact that you actually able to sit down and fucking write an email and it

954
00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:40.530
was a victory in itself.
Asking myself if I still have it under control.

955
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.300
I'm a single dad with the career.

956
00:55:42.301 --> 00:55:47.301
I work long hours at night and I'm lucky enough to still be there to get my son

957
00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:51.720
from school every day.
Uh,
I've never missed one of his games or races,

958
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:54.360
but at the same time,
um,

959
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.330
I've been taking these painkillers every day.

960
00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:59.970
It felt like carrying a demon on my back.

961
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.650
I'm only three days into being cleaned still.
We're drawing,
still can't sleep.

962
00:56:04.651 --> 00:56:07.350
Skin is crawling all of the normal symptoms.

963
00:56:07.351 --> 00:56:10.440
That hasn't stopped me from my daily responsibilities out.
Dude,

964
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:13.980
you're a fucking Troper.
Nobody really knows that I'm growing through this.

965
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.380
I don't open up about things like this to people.
Well,

966
00:56:16.381 --> 00:56:19.410
that that's what you need to do immediately.
He said,

967
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:20.790
which is why I'm writing you.

968
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.900
I don't want anything in return just to vent to this,
to someone.

969
00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:29.130
I've been relistening to the podcast to pass the time until these withdraws are

970
00:56:29.131 --> 00:56:32.730
over,
there's absolutely no chance that I'll ever go back to painkillers.

971
00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.230
I feel miserable right now,

972
00:56:34.231 --> 00:56:37.590
but it's the best feeling I've had felt in a long time.
Good for you.

973
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:39.900
No more demon on my back.
Well that's great.

974
00:56:39.901 --> 00:56:43.950
Well you need to reach out to people cause it's okay to,
uh,

975
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:45.050
say that you need help.

976
00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:49.860
<v 1>And um,
you know,
from what I've heard,
you know,</v>

977
00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.210
getting off opiates is,
is,
is,
is difficult,

I don't know a lot about drugs like that,

979
00:56:58.231 --> 00:57:02.790

982
00:57:10.021 --> 00:57:12.390

984
00:57:16.681 --> 00:57:20.130

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:34.890
I'm going to be on Jimmy Kimmel tonight promoting the front runner movie

990
00:57:34.891 --> 00:57:39.030
starring Hugh Jackman.
It's the,
uh,
the Gary Halbert story,

991
00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:44.610
uh,
directed by Jason Reitman.
I'm so psyched to be in this movie.
A truly is,

992
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.473
you know,

993
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.810
one of the great things I've been able to be a part of as far as being in an

994
00:57:48.811 --> 00:57:52.830
ensemble.
Ah.
Um,
so check that out tonight.

995
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:57.200
And uh,
other than that,
I got to go buy a shirt to wear on Kimmel cause you know,

996
00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.120
God knows you can't wear the same shirt on TV more than once.

997
00:58:01.121 --> 00:58:05.730
I can't do that.
You know,
oh you fucking assholes and make fun of me who have,

998
00:58:05.731 --> 00:58:09.660
you know,
10 shirts that are in there,
you know,
that ship your pitching staff,

999
00:58:09.661 --> 00:58:14.340

10 fucking shirts yet,
show Biz,
you know,

1000
00:58:14.341 --> 00:58:17.250
allowed to do that.
You gotta wear it once.
So what you do is,

1001
00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:20.250
I always try to pick something that,
you know,
it doesn't really stand out,

1002
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.060
just sort of a bland fucking color.
You get any sort of designs on it.

1003
00:58:24.061 --> 00:58:27.570
The people that God had said the shirts you wore fucking camel.
Yeah,

1004
00:58:27.571 --> 00:58:31.290
it is now wearing it again once I spoke to throw it out.
You wasteful can't.

1005
00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:36.840
Um,
anyway,
so I have to do that and I'm also going to be,
uh,

1006
00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:41.820
you know,
I always make pumpkin bread during,
uh,
between um,

1007
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:47.280
what is it,
Halloween and thanksgiving.

I start busting out the pies.

1008
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.960

1009
00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.720

I can't wait.

1010
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.120
I'm very excited and uh,

1011
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:56.970
I think my daughter's still one year away from maybe going trick or treating.

1012
00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:02.790
I Dunno.
I'll ask the AF.
I'll have to ask my wife about that.
But that's it.

1013
00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:05.280
Go Patriots.
Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton.

1015
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.510

What a great fucking a week for me as a sports fan.
All right.

1016
00:59:15.511 --> 00:59:17.840
And I'm not rubbing it in either.
All right.

1017
00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.160
I hope the Dodgers win it again next.
If we don't,
how's that?

1018
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:26.660
That's the nicest thing I could say.
All right.
Okay.

1019
00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:30.020
That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.
Enjoy the next couple of days.
