How are Ya?

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.240
Oh Shit.
Wait a minute.
Today was supposed to be the fucking first day,

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.330
the pink football and I didn't see any of that shit out there.

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.740
Did they abandon it?
Did I dream that it went away?
Uh,
that's,

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.030
they probably walked away.
Too many people getting wise.
They made their money.

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.270
The old filthy stinking NFL snuck away.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.850
<v 1>The all their pick money to raise awareness.
Uh,
yeah.
You know,
we'll fuck,</v>

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.130
you know,
we made our fucking money off of it.
We'll,
uh,
we'll,
we'll,
maybe there's,

13
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.610
I don't know.
I should as I thought it was in October,
isn't that when the,

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.630
the pink lady takes it and all that money because everybody's suffering fucking

15
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:58.830
asshole to buy herself a pink yacht.
Isn't that how it works?
You know?

16
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:00.840
And then everybody walks around with a little fucking pink,

17
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:03.540
a pocket square or some shit.

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.550
Let's take a moment of silence to listen to all the money that is not going

19
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:13.530
towards the disease.
We all think we're trying to fight right now.
Jet's Passover.

20
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.490
Fucking somebody eat some fucking cotton candy.
Yay.
And onto the games.

21
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.110
<v 2>Um,
all right.
I'm not going to be like this.
Okay.</v>

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.420
It's Sunday when I'm recording this.
I just got back from a a fun weekend.

23
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:30.560
I did two nights in Madison,
Wisconsin.
And uh,

24
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.660
then I did a Gig in Omaha,
Nebraska.

25
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.640
Went to the corn huskers game verse a Illinois,
which is a great time,
legendary,

26
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:39.830
legendary football stadium.

27
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:43.340
Can't believe I finally got there back in the day.
I used to do,

28
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:45.830
so I'm going to actually talk to my agent because I used to do so many fucking

29
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:48.080
college gigs back in the day when I was coming up.

30
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.060
And then somewhere along the line,
you know,

31
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.250
you get a following and then you just go to the city and you've,

32
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.510
you either go to the club or if you're lucky you go to a theater or some shit.

33
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.070
And I'm somewhere along the line,
I just Kinda,
I got out of doing,

34
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:02.540
I want to get back to doing that shit.

35
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.570
But all I remember was I did a Zillion fucking colleges in Nebraska and Kansas.

36
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.380
I was forever flying into,
into fucking Kansas City.

37
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.510
And driving out to Hays is Hayes.
Nebraska is a key.
Is it haze?

38
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:25.250
Can I can't even remember.
Dodge city,
grand junction.

39
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.940
I can't eat.
I can't remember the names of it was so fucking long ago.

40
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:33.650
I just remember when you got on the 80 in Nebraska.
Jesus Christ clear.

41
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.650
You're going to scratch the whole podcast buddy.
Huh?

42
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.520
Let me help you with,
let me help you with that.
It's under your collar.

43
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.290
I've got you.
I got you.
I got to do it.

44
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.990
If there it is all look at that face and when they stick their face subtle

45
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.460
little further.
Oh,
that's the spot.
There it is.

46
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.340
Good.
All right,
great.
Okay.
Anyways,
Jesus,

47
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.730
go on.
Go down,
go lay down.
Go on,
go on.
Um,

48
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.490
so you go across the,
uh,
the 80,
um,

49
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.250
you get about halfway across the state and there was this weird like a fucking

50
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.780
footbridge with just go across this highway and,
um,

51
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.030
major highway.
I mean basically take that thing.

52
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.570
I all the way out to San Francisco.
If you go west and I think it,
uh,

53
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.940
I don't know where the hell that went dies.

54
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:24.010
I drove the 70 the whole way that one dies.

55
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:29.011
Some I drove it from like picked it up and like Utah offer the 15 drove the 70

56
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.460
all the way into like fucking Pennsylvania,
like a madman.

57
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.010
I would tell you that I drove cross country and like three and a half days by

58
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:40.960
myself with all my shit in my car,
my big square fucking TV,

59
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.540
you know,
parking next to f,
you know,
you know,

60
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:48.220
in parking lots sleeping would even get a fucking hotel room.

61
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.720
I got a hotel room one night,

62
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:52.960
but then I had to like pick the fucking TV up and take it in and it was just a

63
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.480
pain in the ass.
So I was just like,
yeah,
fuck it.

64
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.200
The next night I slept in the car anyways.
I drove like a fucking lunatic,

65
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:02.770
like 70,
80 miles an hour the whole way there.
And um,

66
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.000
didn't get pulled over until I got to the George Washington bridge.

67
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.390
And that's what I got pulled over and the cop came up to window and go,
you know,

68
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:12.370
it's funny,
I drove here all the way from day.

69
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.570
I do think guy just shut the fuck up.
Give me if
he didn't,
he didn't.

70
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.730
He didn't give a shit about how I thought it was a funny little moment.
You know,

71
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.760
I just drove fucking 2,500 miles and I didn't have a problem and I got down to

72
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.810
the last three miles of my trip and a then I'm getting a ticket and this,

73
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:33.400
this man did not give a shit and he gave me a ticket sell.
Anyways,

74
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.130
I had done a bunch of college kids out there.
So throughout the years,

75
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:38.080
that's how I went to all the baseball stadiums,

76
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:41.980
football and all that shit when I was on the road.
And uh,

77
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.010
every fucking time I would be anywhere near Nebraska if they had a game,

78
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:50.500
it was always at night or if they had a game,

79
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:52.150
they were on the road and I was never able to go.

80
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.830
So fortunately I finally got to go and um,
it was pretty cool,
actually.

81
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.050
Met Larry the cable guy there.
I had never met him.

82
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.120
I've seen him blow up throughout the years and uh,

83
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.000
got to hang out with him and he's like the fucking president out there.

84
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:11.680
So like they had like all their Heisman trophy winners were there that day.

85
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.880
So Mike Rozier came in and actually got a picture with him and Larry the cable

86
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:18.850
guide photo bombed it in the background.
I was there with Nate Craig.

87
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.290
We had a great fucking time.

88
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.580
I'm so thanks to Larry for letting us in to his,
uh,

89
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.260
his,
his fucking,
whenever you called the living room,
the suite there,

90
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.180
it was just great.
But anyways,
the stadium was amazing.

91
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:36.340
Those people are fucking loud too.

92
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:40.210
That wasn't like the most riveting game either.
Like the first half.
Of course,

93
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:44.860
the part that I saw before to drive back up to Omar,
um,
kind of sucked.

94
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.940
And it also,

95
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.680
it really sucked because I bet Nebraska and they were given 20 and a half points

96
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.060
in the halfway through the second quarter.
I'm just thinking,
why the fuck

97
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.350
would I give 20 and a half points to Lovie Smith,
this guy,

98
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.050
this guy fucking coach in the NFL,
sorry,
I'm Yonah here,
guide,

99
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.050
coach in the NFL for like,

100
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:08.600
I don't know how many goddamn years now he's at the college level.

101
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.140
You're going to give,
I'm going to give this guy 20 and a half fucking points.

102
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.740
And Larry kept going.
I don't worry about it,
don't worry about it.
We,
we've,

103
00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.150
we've scored more points of the fourth quarter than anybody else.

104
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.310
And they actually came back and they made it close.
But uh,

105
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.500
by then I was long gone and uh,
we drove up and had a great show in Omaha,

106
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.350
which I've never done a gig there.

107
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.850
I've landed at that fucking airport a zillion times,
but I've never,
um,

108
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.090
never did like an adult show.
There was always like a college show.
So,
um,

109
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.120
that was,
it was just a great fucking weekend.
But I come home today,

110
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.840
I came home really early cause I want to come home,
watch the Patriots,

111
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.140
see if we could go for now.
And I knew this was going to be a tough game.

112
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.831
Toughest game.

113
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.520
Cause Rex Ryan really gets up for the fucking patriots and Bill Bellacheck and

114
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:56.180
all that.
And uh,
we got a butts kit.

115
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.330
Basically we lost on all levels how offensive line couldn't protect,

116
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.550
uh,
whoever the fuck's our quarterback,

117
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.990
NC state guy there that our asses kicked on special teams

118
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.520
<v 1>and you know,</v>

119
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.160
when you keep going three now and get defense is going to get tired.

120
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:17.250
But I got to tell you something after all of that bullshit to only lose 16 to

121
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:20.720
nothing.
I was pretty happy with that.
And now fucking what's his face?

122
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.130
Tom Brady's back.
So it's over.
It's fuck it over.

123
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.870
The whole fucking thing is behind us now.
You know,

124
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.940
I was worried.
What if we go on for,
you know,

125
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.430
one in three would soc two and two it'd be great.

126
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.080
Three one would be ridiculous for no is like fucking a possum when we have,

127
00:07:40.081 --> 00:07:44.350
we went three and one and then meanwhile the cry baby colts.

128
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.863
Oh,
you with

129
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.720
<v 3>too squishy,
right.</v>

130
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.260
<v 1>Those fucking cunts went one in three.</v>

131
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.020
Those fucking conch flew to the other side of the world to get their ass as well

132
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.400
by the fucking Jacksonville Jaguars.
You know what?
And in the end,

133
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.500
all of this bullshit,
the Patriots,

134
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:08.640
it's three one the culture one and three are the football gods have spoken

135
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.760
<v 2>fucking horse shit.
Dumb is fucking most pathetic as fuck it every,</v>

136
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.260
every fucking drives me nuts.
I keep saying I'm going to stop talking about it.

137
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:19.230
Keep going up.
And I just,

138
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.860
I keep looking up the colts and all the fucking shit that they did and just

139
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:27.840
nothing.
They get nothing.
Suck for luck.
Remember that.

140
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.150
Let's tank a whole fucking football season.

141
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.360
Been able to luck wishes they didn't do that,
huh?

142
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:35.880
<v 1>Anyways,</v>

143
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.600
so it's all back to normal and you guys can all fuck a relax because I'm never

144
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:44.100
going to talk about this again.
I'm never going to trash.
Germer Jimmerson again.

145
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:48.330
I make a promise.
I promise you guys that I will go at least

146
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.130
<v 2>I'd say 30 minutes until the next podcast,
before I trashed them enough.</v>

147
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.700
I don't know.
Whatever the next fucking things he does,

148
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.720
I'll fucking trash him again.
But,
uh,
I'm just like Tom Brady's coming back,

149
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.780
coming back against a Cleveland,
which is a decent team.

150
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.450
It's where fucking check.
Use the coach and,

151
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.440
um,
and they let them go.
They fired bill Belichick.

152
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.220
Ah,
who know,
who know?
Um,

153
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.290
did anybody watch the I that Clemson fucking Louisville Gay men?
That was,

154
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.360
I was on stage when I was in Omaha,
so I missed the first half,
but I,

155
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:32.610
I came back about midway through the third quarter.

156
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:37.320
What a fucking unbelievable game.
Um,
I also Miss Tennessee.

157
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.750
Tennessee had like,
if it wasn't for the clubs of Louisville game,

158
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:42.420
basically he had the game a week to two weeks in a row.

159
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.560
I think they're undefeated at foreign.
Oh,
a five.
[inaudible]

160
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.050
two and own EFCC um,

161
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.850
just a bunch of great games and I got to talk to people like my people.

162
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.560
All right.
People in Massachusetts,
people in New York,
places where I've lived,

163
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:03.330
those are pro football city cities.
I'm telling you,
you're fucking missing out.

164
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.270
I feel bad for you if you're not into college football.

165
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.770
I understand if you're married,

166
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:11.610
you got kids and at some point you got to take them out for a fucking ice cream.

167
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.000
I get that.
But,
um,
you're,
you're fucking mix of missing out.

168
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.720
I would just say just pick a fucking team.
You know,

169
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.590
I was never like a BC eagles fan.
I just know I liked,

170
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.360
I liked Boston University and a football team.
Uh,
you know,

171
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.690
it doesn't exist anymore for whatever fucking reason.
I don't know what happened.

172
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.840
I used to go to those games when I was a kid in Nicus and field there,
um,

173
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.880
where I also went and I saw a USFL game.
I saw the Boston breakers first,

174
00:10:38.881 --> 00:10:41.310
the Washington federals.
We won,
of course.

175
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.550
And the place was packed too.
Um,
I dunno.

176
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.960
So just pick a fucking team.
Just pick a teen to fall.

177
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.150
Don't be a Douche and pick Alabama,

178
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.720
but you got to pick somebody competitive or you're not going to get into it.

179
00:10:57.721 --> 00:11:02.310
So I picked Lsu and I'm going to see Lsu,
uh,
next week when they play Florida.

180
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.110
And,
uh,
I don't know that it's going to be a weird,
I hope that game doesn't suck.

181
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.850
I didn't see how Lsu did this week,

182
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:12.450
but I know that they fired less in their fucking offensive coordinator.
So

183
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.800
it's kind of crazy to do that in the middle of a fucking season.

184
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.680
I've never really seen that before.
But anyways,

185
00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:21.960
I made an ass of myself as always when I,

186
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.500
when I landed in Nebraska because we had to get up at seven in the morning

187
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.490
cause I thought the fucking game was at 1230.

188
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.150
I don't know if when I was out here when I bought the tickets,
if it just said,

189
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:37.980
uh,
he was just doing like Pacific coast time cause we're,

190
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:40.560
we,
we're two hours behind him.
I don't know why you would do that.

191
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.610
So I thought the game was at 1230 so I've got like 7:00 AM flights out of

192
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:48.540
fucking a Madison,
Wisconsin connect in Chicago O'hare,

193
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.980
which is always a nightmare,
you know that fucking airports like nine miles long.

194
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.770
Um,
so we fucking,

195
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.540
we connect there and then we land.
And,
and what I got off,

196
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:05.230
I was so fucking tired and I had gone out the night before like a fucking

197
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.600
asshole.
And when I landed,

198
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.510
I saw this kid when I was going to the rental car place,

199
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:14.260
he had this Kansas Jayhawks shirt on.
And uh,

200
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:17.890
I've always loved Kansas is,
I don't know why I was one year.
I just,

201
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:22.810
as I started watching them,
um,
I just liked him,
you know,
and,

202
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:25.800
uh,
so I've always wanted to go to the field house and everything.
So I saw it.

203
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.290
I was like half asleep and I was just like,
oh shit,
Kenzie Jay Hawks Fan.
He goes,

204
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.900
yeah,
I go,
they play in Lincoln or Omaha.

205
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.580
Like I wasn't even thinking like in the kids,
like,
uh,
they play in Lawrence,

206
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:37.414
Kansas,

207
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.440
and I just walked away and I was so fucking tired.

208
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:48.370
It didn't even hit me till Nate started laughing at me.
I was like,
oh my God,

209
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.880
he's gonna think I'm a fucking idiot.
He was a good,

210
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.000
I listen to the podcast and everything.
I was just like,
oh yeah,
kids is,

211
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.350
do they play in Nebraska?

212
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.880
That's basically what I said to him and he just sort of looked at me like,
ah,
no.

213
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.060
He probably walked away like,
wow,
that really isn't an act.

214
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.670
He really is that fucking stupid.
Um,
so anyways,

215
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.660
I want to read this,
this thing to you.

216
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.900
This is one of my favorite things that I've seen in a while.
Um,

217
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:19.000
the Ryder Cup in Golf.
All right,
I'm sorry that this is all fucking sports.

218
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.510
You know,
I could talk Trump for a second if you want to.

219
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.220
What does this horse shit that they get the guy's fucking tax information.

220
00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:31.450
Somebody sent that in.
All right.
I love everybody go,
oh somebody,

221
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:35.170
somebody that works from sends it in now why aren't they being prosecuted for

222
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:39.730
something?
You just can't take somebody who's fucking tax refund and send it in.

223
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And then the fucking,
they all they got is like,

224
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.320
they got like one year of his shit or something like that and they just looked

225
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:47.711
at it and he'd,

226
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:52.330
he claimed a fucking 900 something million dollar loss when his casino went out

227
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:56.020
of business or something like that.
And then they go,
um,

228
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.690
and he legally found these loopholes.

229
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.350
Keyword there is legal.
So I don't understand.

230
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.720
And I fucking can't stand the guy and I'll,
and I'll tell you I'm not,
I'll tell,

231
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.430
I'll tell you,
I'm not voting for that fucking guy.

232
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.540
I'm not voting for fucking Hillary there and fuck all you cuts ago.
Ooh,

233
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.050
you don't vote for Hillary.
I was like,
well,
the Trump,
go fuck yourself.
It isn't,

234
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.660
I want to try to find somebody,
you know,
that's,
that's,
I dunno,

235
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.490
remotely fucking honest,

236
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.290
to try to encourage more honest people to run for this fucking office.

237
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.370
I just don't understand all the policies out there.
They're just cave and go,

238
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:37.430
these are our two choices.
I'll just fucking pick one of these in,
in,

239
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.290
you know,
I think they'd like to keep writing,
I guess is his guy,
Gary Johnson.

240
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:45.130
People are freaking out about like,
he's the next fucking great white hope,

241
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.390
you know that right.
He's going to somehow stop the bankers,
right.

242
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.770
Or some shit.
And,
uh,
so they keep writing these fucking articles cause they're,

243
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.840
they're worried that they just make the assumption that if you would,

244
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.580
if you didn't vote for Gary Johnson,
that you would vote for,
um,

245
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.880
what's her face?
Oh,
crooked fucking,
uh,
Kathy there.
Hillary Clinton.

246
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.230
I hate when they do that.

247
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:13.980
Like they don't understand what people are doing when they vote for,
uh,
uh,
uh,

248
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.440
a third option.

249
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:17.883
<v 4>You know what I mean?</v>

250
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.930
<v 2>It's you saying,
fuck these two people and fuck both those political parties.</v>

251
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:28.070
They just always assume that when you go that to that third party that you're

252
00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:31.940
really a democrat.
Like there's no republican out there sitting there going,

253
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:36.380
there's no fucking way I could vote for Trump or Hillary.
You know what I mean?

254
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.230
I Dunno.
Anyways,
let's,
let's,
uh,

255
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:44.260
but the guy fucked like somebody swipes his fucking tax return that can't be

256
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:49.010
fucking legal.
I don't think this guy has it laying around somebody.

257
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:53.000
It's from 1995.
Somebody obviously snoop and for the fucking thing,

258
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.270
like basically there was a legitimate crime committed.

259
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.450
The New York Times looks at his fucking tax refund.

260
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.400
All they can say is that he legally found loopholes so great.

261
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:06.080
So then he didn't cheat on his taxes.

262
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.093
<v 4>MMM.</v>

263
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.670
<v 2>I don't know.
Like,
like the fucking Clinton's pay taxes.</v>

264
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.840
What the fuck are they doing?
Throw their daughter a $3 million fucking wedding.

265
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.650
You get the best.

266
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.110
The most money Bill Clinton ever made was 400 grand a year fucking as president

267
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.230
until he started giving all those speeches to the constant funded them.

268
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.940
They washed all that bribe money.
They're all filthy.
Oh,
I'm the angry voter.

269
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.570
I'm going to write in my dog.
I hate when people,
now that's,

270
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:38.770
that's thrown you fucking vote away.
Like everybody in Washington goes,
wow,

271
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.420
this guy was so fed up.
He wrote his dog's name.
It guys,

272
00:16:43.421 --> 00:16:46.180
I think we all need to stop and figure out what we're doing.
Clia.

273
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.990
Why are you so itchy?
Cleo?

274
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.100
Did you get into something
stark?

275
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:57.780
We got this great backyard is a waiting for the fucking kitchen and get done.

276
00:16:57.781 --> 00:16:58.800
Did I tell you guys what happened?

277
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.420
Did he tell you when they went to the floor with the fuck they found?
Uh,

278
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.720
that's not going to make it go an extra two fucking weeks.
Um,

279
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.210
and we don't have this place as long as that.

280
00:17:09.211 --> 00:17:11.850
So I think I'm going to be staying in a fucking hotel.
It's just,

281
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.000
I don't know why we did it.
I don't know why we did it.
I mean,

282
00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:16.290
I was kind of all for,
hey,

283
00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:21.120
why don't we just stay in the house until it catches on fire and when the cloth

284
00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:25.290
wiring flashes or whatever the fuck it does and just burns the whole thing down,

285
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.600
we just walk away from this.
Would that be great?

286
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.990
Do you ever think of how fucking great having everything you own just burned to

287
00:17:30.991 --> 00:17:33.480
the fucking ground.
As long as you got some money in the bank,

288
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.790
obviously if you don't have the money in the bank that would be fucking,

289
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.670
but if you just get you to your work and

290
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.160
<v 4>okay,</v>

291
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.070
<v 2>you just walk away from all of it,
right?
No more trips to goodwill,
right.
No more.</v>

292
00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:48.010
Nothing sentimental that you just can't get rid of anymore.

293
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.970
It's just all you got the fucking shirt on your back.

294
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.680
You like fucking Johnny Appleseed.
You know,
I've got to tell you,

295
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:58.290
the longer I live,
the more urge I have.

296
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:03.291
Like I was out in Nebraska and I was fucking in like Wisconsin and I was

297
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:06.900
envious.
I was like,
look at all this fucking space these people have,

298
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.630
who is trees other than they have,
they have water.

299
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.910
Shit doesn't just catch on fire on his shirt.
They got them tornadoes out there,

300
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.460
you know.
But uh,
I went down this road when I was in Wisconsin,

301
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:21.294
I swear to God,

302
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.140
it's like one of those roads that they shoot a car commercial one.

303
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.630
And I was just out there like in Nebraska going this right here,

304
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:30.840
this is where you could actually,
you could,
you could have a fast car,

305
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.170
you could write a fucking motorcycle and that worry that someone's going to

306
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:38.790
fucking kill you every three seconds.
You could actually get your car,

307
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.300
you know,
up to 80,
90 miles an hour out here.
La,

308
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.680
you got to try to do it at three in the morning and you get on the fucking

309
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:47.101
highway.

310
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:50.850
And that's the only time those poor baskets can try to fix the fucking thing.

311
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.850
So then they have it all go down to one lane and you're sitting in traffic in at

312
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:57.960
three in the morning.
Um,
so it's beautiful.

313
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:02.250
I fucking love Wisconsin,
man.
I'm a big fan of Milwaukee too.
Um,

314
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.870
and Nebraska was the shit and uh,
I dunno,

315
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.650
I think I would slowly,
you know,
he would go crazy.
My wife would go crazy if I,

316
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:11.580
if I brought her up there,

317
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.340
first focus should probably be like one of the only black people in fucking

318
00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:18.690
Nebraska.
But,
but I would also be able to leave,
you know,

319
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.250
I could fly around and go do gigs and go to a big city and then fucking come

320
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:27.210
back,
you know,
be hilarious then.
Then she'd want to be a road dog with me.

321
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.010
Like then she'd be all excited.
Where are you going?
I want to go.
Cause like,

322
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:32.940
I don't know if you guys noticed,

323
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:36.720
but Nia never goes on the road with me unless I go,
I'm going.
If I go to Miami,

324
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:40.200
all of a sudden she wants to support me because I get lonely out there.

325
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:45.300
If I go to New York City,
anytime I leave the country,
you know,

326
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:48.210
but when I really fucking need her,
you know,

327
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.810
when I'm fucking going to,
I don't know,

328
00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:54.300
going out to El Paso or some shit like that,

329
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.150
but I can't even say that because I had a great time when I was there.

330
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.400
That's the fucking thing.
When I go on the road,
I whatever people do,
I,

331
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:03.900
I just people,
there's no way.
People just sit around not having fun.

332
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.430
They're going to figure out how they're going to have fun.

333
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:10.530
You just got to figure out where the fuck it is.
And uh,
you know,
who knows?

334
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:13.020
Next thing you know,
you're in Jacksonville,
Florida at a fucking gun range,

335
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:16.530
shooting a gun with a silencer actually got to fucking do that.
And everybody,

336
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.170
whenever they bring up Jacksonville,
oh my God,
there's nothing there.

337
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.750
All I think about a feeling like I was in the secret service,
right?
Right.
Cleo,

338
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.950
when those James Bond fucking movies,
they was a disappointing sound by the way.

339
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:34.950
Um,
the silencer,
it didn't have that cool fucking movie sound like it was like,

340
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.150
it didn't sound like that.
It a,
a metal clanky sound.
It was really quiet.

341
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:41.490
If you're a light sleeper,
you'd wake up,
it'd be like,

342
00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:43.740
did somebody just get killed in the other room?
But if you're,

343
00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:47.620
if you're like a normal sleeper,
Cleo,
you can't scratch the whole podcast.

344
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.260
All right now God dammit,
you weren't scratching it all before he started.

345
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.130
And the second this thing comes on,
you just lay on the wires.
Come here.

346
00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.190
Do you have any concept of,
of a podcast?
Do you,

347
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.550
you can't just lay on the mixer.
You're just looking at me like,

348
00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.720
can you fucking start rubbing my belly here?
What,
what are we trying to do here?

349
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.600
Um,
all right,
so let me,

350
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.620
and let me get to my favorite fucking thing I've read in a long time.
Uh,

351
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.400
clearly you've got to get off the wires.
It's my fault.
They called you up.

352
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.650
I love you buddy.
But you could,
you gotta go.
Do you want get over there?

353
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.660
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

354
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.680
<v 2>go on.
Go see mommy.
Go see mommy.
Go on.
Go on.
I love that.</v>

355
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:31.740
She knows what that means.
All right.
I gotta read this fucking thing here.

356
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.670
All right,
so the Ryder Cup is like a,
I dunno what it is.
I fucking hate golf.

357
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.060
I don't hate it.
I like smoking cigars.
I like getting drunk,
but I just,

358
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:39.721
I can't fucking,

359
00:21:39.721 --> 00:21:43.590
I can eat the fucking assholes stand over the ball for like nine hours.

360
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.400
You're going to slice it.
Just fucking hit the thing.

361
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.050
And didn't drop another one and they all fucking,

362
00:21:49.051 --> 00:21:53.160
she won't talk about fucking cheaters.
Jesus fucking Christ.

363
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.320
Yeah.
I,
I hit a six six.
What?

364
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.200
Fucking lost balls.
You asshole.
We fucking saw you whacking at it.

365
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:04.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

366
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.340
<v 2>One of my favorite things to do when it golf is I count every fucking stroke.</v>

367
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.960
If I'm on the fucking,
if I'm teeing off,
whatever the fuck you call it.
All right.

368
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.720
If I swing and miss,
I count that fucking thick because people would od.

369
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.100
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I was trying.
That counts.
You cheat and con,

370
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.030
you know others so much cheating and fucking golf because the people generally

371
00:22:28.031 --> 00:22:31.210
speaking who play it or not fucking athletic.
He got a lot of bankers.

372
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.620
You got a lot of stuff,
shirts.

373
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:34.930
You've got a lot of people are just motivated by fucking money.

374
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.450
They will never picked a gym class.
Okay.

375
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.950
They had their underwear yanked up over their fucking head and it had this anger

376
00:22:41.951 --> 00:22:44.530
in him.
I'm going to show up some day when I come back to the fucking high school

377
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:44.901
reunion.

378
00:22:44.901 --> 00:22:47.360
I'm going to have this fucking unbelievable car or whatever the fuck it is that

379
00:22:47.361 --> 00:22:48.700
deal.
Or maybe they're born into money.

380
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.940
Well maybe I'm just completely full of shit and I don't like the sport because I

381
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.740
am I my legs a white like the mood,
so to Allah,
maybe that's what it is.

382
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.940
But anyways,
I've been telling you guys that I,

383
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:05.110
I really like wearing golf clothes that's so fucking comfortable.

384
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.910
It's breathable and moveable because there's so many fat fucking,

385
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.470
unless athletic fucks that play that game and they've got to walk around.

386
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:15.401
Who's Kitten,

387
00:23:15.401 --> 00:23:19.000
who they get the golf cart and they want to look to their fucking ball.

388
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.270
You know what I mean?
They got all this shit,
this stoop there.

389
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.780
Fucking socks matches as striping their color,
right?

390
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:30.070
They get the baggy shit on and you know then when they go,
when they go fucking,

391
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:34.930
when they go back with the club and they got to move that dead fucking mush of

392
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:39.100
man tits and belly underneath that shirt,
you know what I mean?
Like,

393
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.940
like the way you lat is or where their lat should be.
Right.
There's all this,

394
00:23:43.941 --> 00:23:48.380
this said,
it's all marbled and that shirt has to fucking stretch.

395
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.363
Right?

396
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.330
So because of those fucking people complaining to the clothing companies like

397
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:57.500
that,
I'm telling you,
the shit is crazy.
How comfortable is,
I love it.

398
00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:58.580
My wife hates it.
So anyways,

399
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:02.770
silhouette the Ryder Cup is basically when the Americans play.
I Dunno,
we,

400
00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.250
I guess we played Great Britain and,

401
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.390
and somebody else who gives a fuck about golf.
It's country versus country.

402
00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:11.670
It's like the Olympics,
except nobody really gives a shit.
Right?
Um,

403
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.310
I know people care,
right?
So anyways,

404
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:22.450
there's some fucking a guy Danny will it and he has a brother and his brother

405
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.290
just went off on Americans.
The American fans.

406
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.510
It's fucking hilarious.

407
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:33.410
And I guess of course it's some big goddamn controversy because somebody had the

408
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:36.830
nerve to call Americans.
You know,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,

409
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.630
I've never understood why,
why you can't do that or why if,

410
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:42.464
if somebody,

411
00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.460
if your brother says something fucked up and you're in the public eye,

412
00:24:46.461 --> 00:24:49.490
all of a sudden you have to answer for it.
Like,
this guy was like stammering,

413
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.090
like apologizing for the guy.
I'd be like,
who said it?

414
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.700
Your brother?
I whoa.
Who said the thing that's your upset?
Who said it?

415
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.060
My brother.
Right?
Yeah.
Well fucking go talk to him yet.
Can't

416
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.420
<v 5>the fuck.
Um,</v>

417
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:09.960
<v 2>and why can't they say that?</v>

418
00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:14.760
Why can't they say that and why does that make the sport lose fans?

419
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:19.560
You know what I mean?
You know why?
Cause there's fucking kids in the world.

420
00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.820
Oh my kid heard that.
Well Daddy,
you know what else he heard?

421
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.300
[inaudible] you fucking your wife the other night.
All right.
That's his mother.

422
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.920
What do you think that did to him?
What are the way I think was worse?
No,
Jesus.

423
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.040
Bill,
I'm always grabbing when I,
when I fly that day.
All right,
here we go.
Um,

424
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.400
so anyways,
uh,
so I guess they're,

425
00:25:38.401 --> 00:25:41.520
they're playing each other and uh,

426
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.170
I guess we play in England in golf or some shit.
Like anybody gives a fuck.

427
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.810
I guess a lot of people give a fuck,
but I don't,

428
00:25:48.811 --> 00:25:52.890
so I assume no one else does because I'm a,
I'm self centered.
So anyways,

429
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.100
his brother was texting with somebody.
I,
this is once again,

430
00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.370
I don't know how somebody found this,
if it was a fucking email or whatever.
Well,

431
00:26:00.371 --> 00:26:01.630
when I read for Danny will,

432
00:26:01.631 --> 00:26:06.631
Ed was quietly going about his business during a Ryder Cup practice round

433
00:26:07.051 --> 00:26:11.250
Wednesday morning when all hell was breaking loose on social media,

434
00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:13.630
thanks to escaping scathing screen.

435
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.680
His brother wrote for a website in which she called Americans fat,

436
00:26:19.471 --> 00:26:22.290
stupid,
greedy,
classless bastards.

437
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.260
You know what I love about that?
That guy,
he just hit the nail on the head.

438
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:35.040
Can we honestly,
can we fucking argue any of that?
Generally speaking,

439
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.950
come on,
let's go through a fat.
You got us stupid.
We go,
you know,

440
00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:42.000
I'll give you that greedy.

441
00:26:42.001 --> 00:26:46.830
Absolutely classless bastards to totally 100 fucking percent.

442
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.780
Dude.
This guy's insults on the fucking golf fans that show up to this thing.

443
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:55.290
It's like when Larry Bird would just be doing the three point contest and he

444
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:57.660
just kept shooting him through the net,
you know?

445
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:00.780
And when he ends it with classless bastards,
that's the two point ball.

446
00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:03.750
The colored one in the end.
Dude,

447
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:07.740
I read this thing like the headline says,
family few.

448
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:09.870
Well we'll let's brother,
however the fuck you say his name.

449
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.860
It just says Colon Americans,
fat,
stupid,
greedy bastards.

450
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:18.840
And I was on the plane and I burst out laughing and I was like,

451
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:23.460
please let this article be as much of a joy to read as the headline.
And it was,

452
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.500
he said,
the
man,
here we go,
stupid.
I can't even say this word.

453
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:33.501
The excoriating of American golf surely was not a part of Darren Clark's

454
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.730
captains handbook,

455
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:39.690
part of which states the visiting team shall not rile up the opposition's home

456
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.840
crowd.
Would trash talk.
Uh,

457
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.410
these were some of the choices of his words in the article.

458
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:48.900
I got to read this fucking article.
This is what he said.

459
00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:51.180
For the Americans to stand a chance of winning,

460
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:53.840
they need their bang mob of imbeciles.

461
00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.240
<v 6>Okay.</v>

462
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.480
<v 2>The only thing that could make this funny is listening to this guy say it in an</v>

463
00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:06.590
English accent.
This is the greatest shit I've written a while to get there.

464
00:28:06.591 --> 00:28:11.591
Bang mob of imbeciles to caress their egos every step of the way.

465
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.720
Team Europe east to shut those groupies up.

466
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.990
They need to silence the pudgy basement dwelling irritants stuffed on cookie

467
00:28:20.061 --> 00:28:21.440
dough and pissy bear.

468
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.300
Pausing between mouthfuls of hotdogs so they can scream Baba booey until they're

469
00:28:26.301 --> 00:28:27.920
jelly faces turned red.

470
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.760
It just keeps going.
They need to stun the angry unwashed,

471
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.710
make America great again.

472
00:28:36.711 --> 00:28:41.711
Swarm desperately gripping their concealed carry con compensators and belting

473
00:28:43.371 --> 00:28:48.371
out a mini belting out a mini erection inducing mash potato hoping to impress

474
00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:51.670
their cousin.
Uh,

475
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.730
they need to smash the obnoxious dads with their shiny teeth.

476
00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.620
Lego man hair medicated ex wife and resentful children.

477
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:05.180
Oh my God.
If I wasn't so lazy,
I'd give this guy a standing ovation.

478
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.560
How do you get mad?
I mean,
how do you get when a guy goes dead heart?

479
00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:13.700
How the fuck do you get mad at that?
I mean,
that's hilarious.
C'Mon man.

480
00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:14.570
You can get,
and then I'll,

481
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.290
you could do the same thing about them that they're fucked up.
Teeth of fet.

482
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:23.030
Fucking fish and chip Eaton jackasses,
Neo Nazi fucking racist.

483
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:26.360
Beating the fuck out of each other at their fucking stupid ass pussy.

484
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.470
Fucking football games.
You can't use your hands.

485
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.360
Everybody flopping around the ground.
Dude,
soccer is such a Shitty fucking sport.

486
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.250
Women's soccer is actually better than the men's.
Alright,

487
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.030
and I'm just talking legit.

488
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.930
I don't mean like volleyball because they're fucking hot.
Dude.

489
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.740
Look at the fucking ass on her.
I'm not looking at them even remotely,

490
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:51.250
even objectifying them.
I'm just saying straight up as a sport.

491
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.940
The fucking ladies play.
Somebody trips them.
They get up.

492
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:59.740
These fucking guys are rolling around on the ground.
Oh my God.
It's,

493
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:02.890
it's fights.
It's like watching musical theater without the fucking music.

494
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:06.250
It's horrific there.
So I did that.
Now does,
does,

495
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.200
does my brother have to apologize to me?

496
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.120
Fucking standing ovation.
What the fuck?
I got to give that guy a shout up.

497
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.170
Not to Danny,
because Danny then for some reason he has to,
you know,

498
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:20.200
he left his fucking balls off in,
you know,

499
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:23.230
in some really comfortable clothes golfing close.

500
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.410
He must have been laughing at his fucking ass off and just be like,
dude,

501
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:30.250
why the fuck did you do that to me?
Uh,
he just goes,
ah,
I just,

502
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.660
after that fucking masterpiece,
all right,
whether you agree with it or not,

503
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:38.530
that was a fucking Lego man.
Hair are pissy beer.
Come on.

504
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.150
The FDA fucking,
uh,
concealed carry.
Compensators

505
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.890
um,
okay.
And then this is what he says,
you know,
off the record,

506
00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:55.250
he laughed his balls off and then on the record he's just like,
uh,

507
00:30:55.251 --> 00:30:58.250
I just like to apologize to everyone involved.
Uh,

508
00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:03.230
I spoke to him on the phone after and I was made aware after I was made aware of

509
00:31:03.231 --> 00:31:05.750
what was being said and I said to Peter,

510
00:31:05.751 --> 00:31:09.680
I was obviously disappointed at what we said and what was written about the

511
00:31:09.681 --> 00:31:13.760
American fans.
Uh,
they took me under their wing fantastically back in April,

512
00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.840
I guess when he won the masters.
And as soon as they got off the golf course,

513
00:31:17.841 --> 00:31:21.650
I went to see Davis and me and Davis had a chat for a few minutes about it all.

514
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.640
Uh,
a took a really well and he's at did,
we took it really well.

515
00:31:25.641 --> 00:31:28.220
They fucking laugh and their balls off and you know what's funny is then they

516
00:31:28.221 --> 00:31:32.130
get,
they got a picture of,
of the American fans,
you know,

517
00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.840
and these f there's three people in the photo and there's not one of them that I

518
00:31:35.841 --> 00:31:39.410
would not go out and get shit faced with.
We need these,
the these,
yeah,

519
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.690
these are the fucking people you need those people.

520
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.690
These are the people who they're not going to do anything in life.

521
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:50.370
They're going to watch other people do shit in life and go fucking nuts.
Right.

522
00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.770
When you accomplish something and when you don't,

523
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.090
they're going to say you suck and talk a bunch of shit about what they would

524
00:31:56.091 --> 00:31:59.430
have done.
Right.
Who Doesn't love being that guy?

525
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:05.460
They're all draped in the fucking,
one guy's dressed like uncle Sam,
another guy,

526
00:32:05.461 --> 00:32:06.450
for whatever reason,

527
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.130
he has an an American flag shirt and that he has like a park ranger hat on.

528
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.070
Maybe that's a golf thing and the other guy has got the fucking,

529
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:18.300
he's got the American flag over his head while wearing a baseball hat.

530
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.490
He looks like an,
he looks like an old woman.
Like when Shit,

531
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.890
like he's wearing like a shawl or something.
Oh that's fucking late.

532
00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.010
And there's nothing better to the dumber.

533
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.880
The fans are at a golf event when they were around pros.

534
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:33.250
That's one of my favorite things.
You know what I mean?

535
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:37.300
Cause you just said every everything about like tennis and golf is Shh,

536
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.290
shh.
Like stop talking shit.
You know what I mean?

537
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.750
It's fucking the fucking NBA.

538
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.390
You're going to take a fucking foul shot.
Like a third of the stadium is,

539
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:53.870
is doing everything but taking their dicks out and shaking it in your face and

540
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:57.020
these guys can consistently make it.
How about a little focus?

541
00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.680
Tennis is the same way.
Quiet please.
Quiet please.
You know what I mean?

542
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.630
They don't boo they whistle.
Oh,

543
00:33:08.631 --> 00:33:13.370
speaking of which,
there's a fucking incredible documentary out there about,
uh,

544
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.990
Serena Williams last year when she tried to do the Serena Slam,

545
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.810
I mean she won four in a row.
Mean she won the US Open,

546
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.890
but it was in 2014 and then she won the Australian,

547
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.710
then she went French.
And then she won the Wimbledon.

548
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.040
So that's four in a row right there.
She did it the way tiger woods did it,

549
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:36.740
like four majors went by.
And,
but I guess,
but Serena Williams,

550
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:41.210
actually that's three one,
sorry.
I Steffi Graf actually did it.

551
00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:44.840
And somebody else,
I forget her fucking name actually,
I believe.

552
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.980
I haven't looked it up in a while,

553
00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:50.030
but I believe that they did it in a calendar year.
So I'll give him that one.

554
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:52.700
But when they will break and tiger woods balls,
give me a fucking break.

555
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.660
Nobody's even come close to doing that and he fucking,
he won four in a row.

556
00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.130
So whatever.
And if you'd read Andre Agassi's book open,

557
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.440
which even if you're not into sports,

558
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.160
which I don't think anybody left listening to this podcast is not into sports

559
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:11.930
after this fucking shit.
Um,
that's all I've been talking about this week.
Um,

560
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.300
if you read his book,

561
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:19.010
it's one of the best books I've ever fucking red as far as like a,

562
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:21.030
an autobiography.
It's,
um,
it's

563
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.620
like I fucking hate reading.
I get add out the fuck.
I got a,

564
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.040
I guess a mild form of dyslexia and I'm a fucking moron.
So I mean,

565
00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:33.650
I've got a lot work and against me.
All right?

566
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.360
And I was riveted reading that book.
Totally fucking engaging.

567
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.950
And uh,

568
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.640
if you've actually read that book and then you watch the Serena documentary,

569
00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:47.330
just like the gist of what that sport does to your body and shit,

570
00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:51.530
it's fucking how half the fucking thing is her laying on a table getting a

571
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:55.580
massage.
You know,
they'll probably just sounded all creepy,
but I'm seriously,

572
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.210
you read the Odyssey thing and the guy sitting and talking about he,

573
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:01.340
he's taking like a fucking hour long shower,

574
00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.390
try to get his body to be able to move again when he's just played the first

575
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:08.450
round of a major and he's got to somehow fight his way through that and getting

576
00:35:08.451 --> 00:35:13.420
shot up with shit.
It's fucking unbelievable.
But,
um,
it's a,

577
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.840
it's a great,
great fucking documentary.
And,
uh,

578
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.760
you got to love the documentaries because my wife will not watch sports,

579
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:23.240
you know,
but if there's a documentary about it,
like a 30 for 30,
you know,

580
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.580
documentaries bring people together,
you know,
like I won't watch real housewives,

581
00:35:28.581 --> 00:35:32.090
but if they did a documentary on one of them and how the fuck they ended up on

582
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:33.860
that,
you know,
that it would be interesting.

583
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.570
You are an absolute fucking failure if you'd,

584
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.730
if you make a document and uninteresting documentary.

585
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:43.620
I'm trying to think the last time I ever saw

586
00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.860
a documentary that wasn't on sub level.
Interesting.

587
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.560
Like you're literally fucking watch somebody like a,
hey,

588
00:35:50.561 --> 00:35:55.510
this is how they make a milk bottles.
Uh,
you know,
the,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

589
00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:01.120
the what,
whatever the fuck you call it.
The,
the way we go about making it,

590
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.510
whatever that big word is,
the process that's not that big.

591
00:36:04.511 --> 00:36:07.210
That's a medium board bill as she has not changed.

592
00:36:07.211 --> 00:36:09.980
It's remained the same for hundreds of years and they're just,
you just go,

593
00:36:09.981 --> 00:36:12.040
I go down a fucking rabbit hole just watching that shit.

594
00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:16.660
Tom Papa the Great Tom Papa fucking,

595
00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:22.130
um,
made me a loaf of bread meat.
Like,
who's kidding,
who we made it for?
Nia.

596
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.470
Nia was the one asking for it,
right?
Tom Doesn't give a shit about me.

597
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.360
The man uses me,
you know,
comes over here.
He smokes all my cigars,

598
00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.430
he drinks all my liquor.
Totally joke at Tom's,

599
00:36:32.431 --> 00:36:35.230
one of one of the great human beings I've ever met.
Um,

600
00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:40.460
he's a great guy and he made it for both of us cause he's a sweetheart.
And um,

601
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.430
so he was telling me this whole thing about how,

602
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:48.530
you know how you make sour sour dough bread like the old fashioned way and how

603
00:36:48.531 --> 00:36:52.910
this,
the yeast bacteria is in the air and you make like this concoction of like

604
00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:56.690
flower cause yeast eats flower and you mix it with water and you got to leave it

605
00:36:56.691 --> 00:36:57.260
out.

606
00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.100
And then when it starts to like for a couple of days and then when it bubbles
up,

607
00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.090
you know it's going to start to smell like beer and you know,

608
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.160
and if he didn't fuck it up,
you know,

609
00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:08.660
once it gets to a certain point out of the year,

610
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:09.980
you put like plastic wrap and sick,

611
00:37:09.981 --> 00:37:14.981
this whole fucking process just to get this thing called your starter so you can

612
00:37:16.221 --> 00:37:20.780
get the fucking sourdough taste in there,
I guess.
And,

613
00:37:20.781 --> 00:37:21.411
and that,

614
00:37:21.411 --> 00:37:25.280
that concoction is one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen in my life.

615
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.023
<v 4>MMM.</v>

616
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:32.090
<v 2>And you just,
you just eat,
it's fucking unreal because once you make it,</v>

617
00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:35.960
you just keep feeding it and it keeps living.
And evidently in France,

618
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.490
did they have the,
these,

619
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.050
these concoctions that somebody started the starter or the,
or mother,

620
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.880
they call it mother,
which is really creepy.

621
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:45.603
<v 4>MMM.</v>

622
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.160
<v 2>Like they started at like a hundreds of years ago,
like a hundred years ago,</v>

623
00:37:49.161 --> 00:37:51.950
somebody started it and they just kept passing it down and people just kept

624
00:37:51.951 --> 00:37:56.780
feeding the fucking thing.
It's really,
it's fucking bizarre.
But that shit,

625
00:37:56.781 --> 00:37:59.900
like if there was a documentary on making bread,
I would sit down and I would,

626
00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.560
I would watch,
you know?

627
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.260
But if there was a fucking Sitcom about people that made bread,

628
00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:09.460
I would fucking take a gun out.
I wouldn't kill myself,
but I would want to,

629
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.840
you know what I mean?
Why do I always go to suicide?

630
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.070
Does anybody else think?
I just always think that.
I just always think about like,

631
00:38:18.071 --> 00:38:22.210
yeah,
you know,
I could,
I could either sit through this or I could,

632
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.980
I could dive under that passing bus.

633
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.140
I'm not going to do it.
Hey,

634
00:38:29.141 --> 00:38:34.141
would you do it if you absolutely fucking knew without a Debbie weird,

635
00:38:34.331 --> 00:38:37.690
if you knew without a that there was,
there was a better place.

636
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.370
You know what I mean?

637
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.340
If you knew without a doubt there was a better place than you would go into it.

638
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:44.980
Like you gotta you gotta be thinking back.

639
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:47.830
This does to had to be a couple of events.
You know,
we just select Jesus.

640
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:51.250
I got this paper due,
I'm with this girl,
I got to break out.

641
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:55.930
I don't a fucking break up with her,
you know,
it's just all right.
That was dark.

642
00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:58.450
Okay,
let's,
let's get out of that.
You should never do that.

643
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:04.480
It's not an option.
There's always hope,
you know,
you know what's a great thing?

644
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:06.550
You don't want to get you out of a depression.
You get a dog,

645
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.430
you get a dog like mine that'll put you in a happy mood.

646
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.930
Dogs are the fucking best.
You know,
you come home that just,

647
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:15.400
I know every comic has done a bit on this,

648
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:17.200
but they're just so fucking psyched to see it.

649
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:21.730
They're always fucking psyched to see you can never disappoint them.

650
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.660
You know what I mean?
They just love you.
They're the best.
You know,

651
00:39:25.661 --> 00:39:30.040
the other night,
you know,
when I was,
I was fucking a,
I hate to move my car,
right?

652
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.630
Um,
and it was like,
you know,
street cleaning day,

653
00:39:34.631 --> 00:39:38.410
so it was opposite side of the fucking street parking.
So,
you know,
I'm like,

654
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:41.770
God damn.
And I went to drive like 15 minutes down the fucking road or some shit.

655
00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:46.090
Right.
And my dog was already asleep,
but because it hurt me going outside,

656
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.900
it immediately got up and was looking at me like,
oh,

657
00:39:48.901 --> 00:39:51.560
how are we going out together and going out?
And I was looking like,
not,

658
00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:55.960
not just fucking just moving the car,
relax dude.
So I go out there,

659
00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:59.050
I drive down the street and it was like a 15 minute walk back.

660
00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.740
Took me a couple of minutes to drive over there.
So I was gone like 1520 minutes.

661
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.770
I come back to the house,
my wife's already in bed,
she's already in bed.

662
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:08.800
She's not concerned about me.
Right.
The lights are all off in the house.

663
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:13.180
I opened the door quietly and who's fucking sitting right there still waiting

664
00:40:13.181 --> 00:40:16.960
for me.
My dog still fucking waiting for me.

665
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.380
And I just looked at the thing.
I was just saying,
yeah,
you know,
and it didn't,

666
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.730
and the it wagging its tail and I locked the door and then it walked with me

667
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:29.180
down the stairs to go to bed.
It was like,
it was like a body guard.
It's,
you know,

668
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.680
hey,
I'm telling you,
they're the fucking best.
Having said that,

669
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:34.840
some fucking lady on my flight

670
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:41.410
on my way out,
like,
dude,
this whole,
um,
I need my dog,

671
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.250
cause I'm afraid to fly.
Fucking thing is getting out of control.

672
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:47.590
Like the size of dog that you can bring on.

673
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.170
This person brought on a dog that was like a,

674
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:54.820
the next weight class up from a cocker spaniel in a poor husband like is

675
00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:58.150
bringing the,
the,
the whole fucking doggy bed.
And I'm thinking going,

676
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.870
are they really thinking they're going to stick that in between the rows?

677
00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.870
And they didn't,
they jammed it in the overhead compartment.

678
00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:09.130
Like the two of them took up an entire rows,
overhead compartment,

679
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:14.020
just fucking selfish cons.
And every time I,
you know,

680
00:41:14.021 --> 00:41:16.780
she'd walked by with the dying and looker,
she do that smile like,

681
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:21.130
isn't it adorable?
Oh yeah,
the dog is adorable.
You're not,
you know,

682
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:24.640
you're a selfish fuck.
That's what I was thinking.
But then you know what,

683
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:27.250
the dog was totally well behaved and it wasn't a fucking problem.

684
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.820
And of course they sat in the row right in front of me and um,

685
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:37.350
I dunno,
I don't know.
You know,
I,
I got to learn to let shit go.
I really did.

686
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.040
I actually,
I'm trying right now,
two things I'm trying to do.
All right,

687
00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.640
not flip out when I drive and not get mad at technology.

688
00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.650
If I could do that I would yell 80% less and uh,

689
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.790
I think my wife would,
would,
would enjoy her life a lot more,
you know?

690
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:02.290
All right,
well I've got to pause here to uh,
to read some advertising.

691
00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:03.520
I don't even know if it's come in yet.

692
00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.870
And then I got to read the questions for this week.
Um,
by the way,

693
00:42:07.871 --> 00:42:09.710
congratulations to the fucking buffalo bills.

That's [inaudible] dot com slash bar.

834
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.300
Can you imagine if you put on those unbelievably comfortable underwear,
right?

835
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.230
And then something makes you laughed and you shit yourself a little bit.
I mean,

836
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:46.700
that would ruin your day,

851
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:50.240
Important.
Fucks the whole thing up.
I'm not saying it anymore.

852
00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.720
Importance off the fucking roster.
I don't give a shit.
Okay.

853

You want me to cook the dinner?
You've got to let me buy the groceries.
Uh,

854
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:59.840

who knows who's that about?
Everybody come up.
Pats.
Fans.

855
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:05.210
What?
Who,
who said it and what player was he talking about in three,
two,
one bang.

856
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.740
Bill Parcells,
Terry Glenn,
who did he say to Robert Craft?

857
00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.370
Um,
if,
but if you're making constant trips to the post office,

858
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:16.970
that's a routine you need to change.

876
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:16.550

that,
that to,
to,
to,
um,

877
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.310
while you guys asked me for advice.
I know why,

878
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.350
because you just want to hear me read out loud.
I know it is.

879
00:53:21.351 --> 00:53:24.860
I know you'd have to take it seriously.
And uh,
anybody takes this seriously.

880
00:53:24.861 --> 00:53:26.400
You're your own.
This is a disclaimer.

881
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.300
<v 1>All right.</v>

882
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:31.530
Why would you take advice from me and went to summer school to what a four years

883
00:53:31.531 --> 00:53:35.640
in high school should have gone all for my sophomore teacher hooked me up,

884
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:38.790
gave me the d minus and senior year.
It was like,
what's the point?

885
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:44.150
Evidently I have to learn a trade.
All right.
Comic book stuff.
Uh,

886
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.840
dear Billy,
unbreakable.
We all know how you hate comic con stuff.

887
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.580
I actually,
I don't,
I don't it,
they're just,
they're an easy target and I'm lazy.

888
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:57.060
You know what I mean?
I Dunno.
I,
I,
I,

889
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.320
although I had recently watched some reality,
I was on a plane,
right?

890
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:03.440
It was on the planes,
it plain.
And,
uh,

891
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:07.350
there was some show and it was just these guys standing around in,
um,

892
00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:12.050
oh,
what the fuck is a comic book store out here?

893
00:54:12.051 --> 00:54:14.870
And I started to watch it and they were all doing that fucking,

894
00:54:14.871 --> 00:54:18.800
if this comic guy,
comic book guy fought that Comic Book Guy.
And I can't,

895
00:54:18.801 --> 00:54:22.790
I can't sit through that,
but I could sit through dude,
who is better Gretzky?

896
00:54:22.791 --> 00:54:27.310
Lemieux uh,
Talon.
You've Loomio didn't have those years off.
I will.
I'll,

897
00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:31.200
I'll fucking stay in that forever.
Uh,
but I,
you know,
I,

898
00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:33.380
I can't get into the competition as much as,
you know,

899
00:54:33.381 --> 00:54:35.750
I like the superheroes when I was growing up,
but then,
you know,

900
00:54:35.751 --> 00:54:40.340
I got older and die a,
I grew up,
alright.

901
00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.450
Superhero movies and loot crate.
I don't hate that shit.

902
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:46.790
I just like making fun of it.
He said,
you've mentioned in the past,

903
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.660
the only superhero you liked was Luke cage,
Aka power man.
No,

904
00:54:50.661 --> 00:54:53.780
I like Spiderman to captain America.
Iron Man.

905
00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.220
Batman was cool more.
The comic book on TV was,
you know,

906
00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:00.740
I'd like that show when I was younger,

907
00:55:00.741 --> 00:55:04.550
but then it was just sort of silly to can't be for me.
Um,

908
00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:10.060
I like the Heath Ledger Batman and I loved that Christian Bale.

909
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.530
You know,
even everybody made fun of his voice.
It,

910
00:55:12.531 --> 00:55:15.860
it fucking made sense that he would change the sound of his fucking voice.

911
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.190
You know,
you guys know what my voice sounded like.

912
00:55:19.191 --> 00:55:23.450
Fight a three quarter fucking mask on and I just started talking to you.

913
00:55:23.451 --> 00:55:26.540
You'd be like,
to what?
The fucks with the mass bill,
you know.

914
00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.170
Anyways.
Uh,
well,

915
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:31.750
<v 5>okay.</v>

916
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:32.920
<v 1>Your should be,</v>

917
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:36.880
you should be excited to know he has his own Netflix series.

918
00:55:36.881 --> 00:55:39.190
Now get the fuck Outta here.
Luke cage does.

919
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:42.640
It's super popular and getting attention,
not just because it's great,

920
00:55:42.641 --> 00:55:44.140
but also because it's topical.

921
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:49.500
It knowingly acknowledges the significance of a bullet proof African American

922
00:55:49.631 --> 00:55:51.850
wearing a Hoodie,
uh,
through the series.

923
00:55:51.851 --> 00:55:55.990
Luke engages with police offers who shoot him and leave holes in these hoodies.

924
00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:00.250
The police often interrogate and harass black people in Harlem who have done

925
00:56:00.251 --> 00:56:03.910
nothing wrong.
Oh,
I gotta watch that.
He goes,
my questions are,

926
00:56:03.911 --> 00:56:07.180
do you still like Luke cage?
Will you watch the series?
Yes.
Yes.

927
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:12.100
Do you think it's good to acknowledge Trayvon Martin and the black lives matter

928
00:56:12.101 --> 00:56:16.420
movement in this way?
Yeah.
Why not?
When you watch those fucking,

929
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:21.190
those Pixar movies,
they talk about global warming.
You know,

930
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.370
they had the ant thing and they go know one answer is not top,

931
00:56:24.371 --> 00:56:28.000
but you got to fall the edge,
start moving.
They could take us over.

932
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:30.300
That was all about like the fucking Bilderberg people.

933
00:56:30.301 --> 00:56:33.040
If they can do all of that shit,
why can't they bring up that stuff?

934
00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.420
I love it.
Is that,
is that a good way to acknowledge is first of all,

935
00:56:38.421 --> 00:56:41.540
who the fuck am I to say that that's not an issue?
That,
that,
uh,

936
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:46.250
that has made my life like,
uh,
I don't have to worry about my life,

937
00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:49.280
you know what I mean?
So I would ask,
why don't you ask black people that?

938
00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:55.370
Do you think it's good to acknowledge?
Anyways,

939
00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:00.350
I love your podcast and you stand up a greetings from Ontario.
Um,
yeah.

940
00:57:00.351 --> 00:57:05.310
I'm just like,
that's,
I mean I like when,
uh,
I like 'em as much as I should.
I've,

941
00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.270
I liked superman versus Batman.
All right.

942
00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:12.080
I like when they do the comic book stuff and as much as like,
you know,

943
00:57:12.081 --> 00:57:15.620
the people can fly in their fucking,
the size of an ant and shit like that,

944
00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:20.390
the more reality that they bring into it,
the more grounded that they keep it.

945
00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:24.490
The more I like it.
And I know superman versus fucking Batman.
They're like,
Geez,

946
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.490
how many people did they fucking kill?
That never entered my mind.

947
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.820
I didn't give a shit.
They're like,
they did billions of dollars with the damage.

948
00:57:31.821 --> 00:57:35.660
Who gives a fuck?
My favorite thing was,
were saying that superhero can't,

949
00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:38.540
they can't be out there acting unilaterally.
Like,

950
00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:41.030
they didn't like that superman was going around,
just helping everybody,

951
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:43.340
regardless of,
uh,
you know,

952
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:45.620
whether they would trade with the United States or not.

953
00:57:45.621 --> 00:57:48.560
And I just love that the United States felt that they could claim superman was

954
00:57:48.561 --> 00:57:52.280
fucked up.
I guess he got adopted by United States parents that he did get a free

955
00:57:52.281 --> 00:57:56.660
education.
Yeah.
What the fuck are you doing?
You know what,

956
00:57:56.661 --> 00:57:59.200
I stand by the American government on that one.
Um,

957
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:00.310
<v 0>yeah,</v>

958
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.040
<v 1>no,
but the more that they can bring in like the,
uh,</v>

959
00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:09.510
just to real world reality,
I think that that shit's great.
And the dark,
I mean,

960
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:14.190
in the comic books,
it isn't always like dark depressing.
They're fucking loners.

961
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.290
Like I never liked the x man thing.

962
00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.660
It just sounded like a bunch of whiny teenagers to me.

963
00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:21.480
They didn't go dark enough or make it adult enough.

964
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:25.010
It was probably for teenage kids.
Who's kidding who,
um,

965
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:29.160
it probably wasn't for a fucking bald 48 year old male.

966
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:36.860
We got to get these guys these,
this is our demographic.
They,

967
00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:41.790
these are the guys that are going to buy all the fucking swag.
Um,
I actually,

968
00:58:41.791 --> 00:58:44.400
uh,
when I was a kid,

969
00:58:44.401 --> 00:58:47.460
I read comic books and I really liked the drawings in the different ways that

970
00:58:47.461 --> 00:58:50.220
they would go about it.
And when,
when,
you know,

971
00:58:50.221 --> 00:58:53.400
sometimes they take up a whole page and they draw something or they'd have like

972
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:57.360
three of the squares would all like a bullet got shot and they just show where

973
00:58:57.361 --> 00:58:58.370
it went and stuff.
Like,

974
00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.440
I really liked it and I thought it was incredibly talented and that thing,

975
00:59:01.441 --> 00:59:04.270
but I stopped short of,
uh,

976
00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.620
like dressing up like them and having like a fucking light saber fight,

977
00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.700
you know what I mean?
Um,
I guess that's where you lose me and,
you know,

978
00:59:11.701 --> 00:59:14.310
to be honest with you,
what I'm doing this with a lot of people do is,
um,

979
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:16.220
I'm taking like,
you know,

980
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:19.290
most golf fans are not like those fucking animals at the Ryder Cup screaming and

981
00:59:19.291 --> 00:59:23.240
yelling like a bunch of fucking lunatics,
you know.
I mean,
a lot of them are,
uh,

982
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:28.070
you know,
you know,
I went to the masters people that people will fucking cool,

983
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:32.720
but it's just,
it's just fun to make fun of them.
I guess
Jesus built,

984
00:59:32.721 --> 00:59:35.990
did you retract everything that you've ever said about it?
Uh,
sort of.

985
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:41.300
Uh,
I'm trying,
I'm trying to be a better fucking person,
man.
I got to stop.

986
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:44.540
Like I just that the word content and all this stuff,

987
00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:49.550
they just flies out of me in public and it's getting worse.
And uh,

988
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:52.670
you know,
it's gotten to the point where now it actually,

989
00:59:52.671 --> 00:59:54.590
for the first time in my life,
like embarrasses me.

990
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:58.160
So I'm trying to see the other side of that.
And I know people are like,
well,
Jen,

991
00:59:58.161 --> 01:00:02.180
you now could it be funny anymore?
Believe me,
I will fuck up plenty of my life.

992
01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:04.880
I don't need to be screaming cunt when there's children around in a fucking

993
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:09.770
airport.
All right.
Montreal pit bull ban.
I bill,
I think you're special.
Let it go.

994
01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:13.940
Did a lot to educate people about what sweet and loving pets pit bulls can be.

995
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.620
I don't have a pit bull myself,

996
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:19.910
but I do not believe in breed specific legislation or banning certain breeds of

997
01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:23.420
dog just because they're more likely to be owned by assholes who will train them

998
01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:28.370
to be violent.
I live in Ontario where pitbulls are already banned.
Uh,

999
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:33.290
when Mark [inaudible],
B,
u.
E.
H.
R.
L.
E.

1000
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:36.800
How the fuck do you say that bill was in?

1001
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.050
That was in the Toronto Blue Jays.
You mean on the Toronto Blue Jays?

1002
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.210
He chose to live alone in Toronto,

1003
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:48.260
away from his family rather than give up their pit bull.

1004
01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.053
Recently,

1005
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:55.270
Montreal Council voted in favor of a bill to ban new pit bulls and other

1006
01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:57.230
dangerous breeds as well as PR,

1007
01:00:57.350 --> 01:01:01.040
impose strict regulations on pit bulls already living in the city,

1008
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.960
including muzzling.
Oh,
putting a muzzle on them.
From what I read,

1009
01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:09.680
the bill seems to be a panic reaction to the death of a woman who died following

1010
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:12.620
a dog attack.
Here's the article.
If you want to read it,

1011
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:17.210
I would love for you to speak out against this super lame bylaw and continue to

1012
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:21.530
use your fame as a platform to educate people about I.
Dude,
I don't do that.

1013
01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.340
I'm not going to be that person.
Hey,
I have a podcast now.

1014
01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:28.550
You should listen to me about social issues.
Um,

1015
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:31.280
perceived as dangerous.
Your bit about doctrine.

1016
01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.860
Cleo is seriously one of my favorite things in life.
I'll thank you.

1017
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.610
I wish everyone could hear it.
Thank you so much,
Bill.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

1018
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:44.980
yeah,
yeah.
I mean,
I,
I don't,

1019
01:01:44.981 --> 01:01:47.350
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck happened up there,
but like,

1020
01:01:47.351 --> 01:01:49.250
I don't think pit bulls,
a bad dogs.
Um,

1021
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:52.570
I will tell you my dog's a fucking psycho and would try to kill you if you came

1022
01:01:52.571 --> 01:01:57.070
into the house would attack you because it's possessive.
It's envious,
jealous,

1023
01:01:57.071 --> 01:01:59.680
whatever the fuck it is.
And uh,

1024
01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.970
my dog is dangerous and um,
you know,

1025
01:02:03.971 --> 01:02:06.880
and if I'm standing there,
I can't be like,
Cleo,
these people are fucking cool.

1026
01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:10.880
But I think what it is is
with my dog,

1027
01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.760
with its personality and the,

1028
01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.800
the information that I did not have access to.
Um,

1029
01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.860
and I don't have like,
like this dog,
like really,
like if this dog,

1030
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.370
when this dog's with my fucking trainer,
like,

1031
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.380
and it stays with him.

1032
01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:32.490
People come and go complete strangers coming to his house and the dog doesn't

1033
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:35.730
flip up.
But with me,
it does.
I let it up on the bed.

1034
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:37.950
I fucking snuggle with the thing and shit.

1035
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:41.610
It thinks it's on the same level as me.
For whatever reason,
it feels like it has,

1036
01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:44.370
it has to run shit.
And um,

1037
01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:45.580
<v 4>okay.</v>

1038
01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.310
<v 1>I just,
you know,
after a while,
because I'm so fucking busy,</v>

1039
01:02:48.311 --> 01:02:53.311
I just had to like sort of adjust my life around the dog,

1040
01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.700
which is not another thing you're not supposed to do.
But um,

1041
01:02:58.570 --> 01:02:58.950
<v 4>okay.</v>

1042
01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:01.200
<v 1>You know,
I can walk it down the street.
It doesn't go after people,</v>

1043
01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:04.180
but if someone just walks up to me,
I don't know and starts talking to me,
it,

1044
01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:06.810
it starts barking.
It doesn't growl a show its teeth,

1045
01:03:06.811 --> 01:03:11.280
but it definitely considers it like a threat.
So,
um,
but this is the thing,

1046
01:03:11.281 --> 01:03:16.281
what I've noticed since having this dog is that there are a bunch of dogs that

1047
01:03:16.381 --> 01:03:17.820
do that of all breeds.

1048
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:22.740
When I walked down the street and what I see rather than the dog is I see the

1049
01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:27.210
owner.
And,
um,
I am not a,

1050
01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:32.480
you know,
I made a lot of mistakes with my dog and,
um,

1051
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.680
whenever my dog passes and I go to get another one,

1052
01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:41.510
um,
I,
I don't know if I can do it,
dude.

1053
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:44.780
I don't know if I can not have the dog be up on the fucking bed.

1054
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:47.600
I have to be disciplined enough to do it.
I actually,

1055
01:03:47.601 --> 01:03:50.540
when I was in Vancouver one time,
or Seattle or some,
this woman told me like,

1056
01:03:50.541 --> 01:03:53.300
she doesn't let her dogs walk on the rug.
I come home,
she goes,

1057
01:03:53.301 --> 01:03:56.600
I don't even look at them until I set everything down there waiting for her and

1058
01:03:56.601 --> 01:03:59.030
waiting for my dog just gets to do whatever the fuck it wants.

1059
01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.160
And I think that that can be

1060
01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.080
<v 4>okay.</v>

1061
01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.590
<v 1>You know,
a dangerous thing.
Um,
the bigger your dog is.</v>

1062
01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.340
So,
um,
I,
I would,

1063
01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:14.260
I would actually say is rather than have a pit bull ban,

1064
01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:15.973
<v 4>mmm.</v>

1065
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:18.210
<v 1>What I would say is,</v>

1066
01:04:18.211 --> 01:04:22.380
if you're going to get a dangerous breed in a pitbull is a dangerous breed and

1067
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:24.750
all that me,
I'm not saying the dog is inherently dangerous.

1068
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:29.400
I'm just saying that if your dog goes to bite somebody,
like anybody's dog can,

1069
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.440
the level of damage that a pit bull can do versus if you get bit by a Chihuahua,

1070
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:38.850
you have to understand,
you know,
you have to respect what you have.

1071
01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:42.030
So what I would say rather than have a pitbull ban,

1072
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:44.263
<v 4>mmm.</v>

1073
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.000
<v 1>I would say,
what if people before you,
you,
you're able to have a pit bull.</v>

1074
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:56.810
You have to take an intensive course and become a fully educated,

1075
01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.200
great dog owner,

1076
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:04.040
which is what I wish was available to me before I got my dog because I had to

1077
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.820
learn all these lessons the hard way and,
you know,

1078
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.670
trying to undo all of the shit that the dog learned as I'm leaving every other

1079
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:17.560
weekend and I'm in a writer's room all day.
It,
you know,

1080
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.970
like owning a dog is a tremendous amount of responsibilities.
So that alone,

1081
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:26.590
forget about all the fucking horrible people,

1082
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.800
human beings that are out there that do horrible fucking things to animals.

1083
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.310
Um,
I mean,

1084
01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:38.230
I'm hypocritical goal because I eat chickens and cows and pigs and shit and,

1085
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:42.340
uh,
you know,
they don't exactly treat them.
You know,
there was,
oh,
it's free range,

1086
01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:43.720
it's organic and all that shit.

1087
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.600
And then you watch the documentary and they're cutting their beaks off and feed

1088
01:05:46.601 --> 01:05:50.950
them cows and shit and it's fucking horrific.
Um,
but,

1089
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:55.660
but you know,
these people who fight dogs and these people who like,
you know,

1090
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:57.570
I mean,
I honestly think like,
you know,
there,

1091
01:05:57.571 --> 01:06:00.520
there was some case in like New York with this guy just,
he was in an argument,

1092
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:01.031
his girlfriend,

1093
01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:04.390
he snatched the girls dog out and fucking like spiked it on the ground and

1094
01:06:04.391 --> 01:06:06.700
killed it into the girl woman's daughter was in the other room.

1095
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.570
And this mother Fucker,
we're only gets 60 days.
It's just like,
uh,

1096
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:12.340
you know,

1097
01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.000
I just Kinda feel like somebody's big enough should have grabbed him in,

1098
01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:17.500
spiked him down on the kitchen floor,

1099
01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:21.730
and then he'd have to fucking deal with the ramifications of that rather than my

1100
01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:26.731
tax dollars paying 60 feign for $60 worth of free fucking meals for this guy to

1101
01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:29.440
be,
and some fucking halfway house,
um,

1102
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.150
like the level of fucking anger issue that that guy has.
Like,
I mean,
that,
that,

1103
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.860
that is like,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
But that's,
that's,

1104
01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.410
that's really a shame.
And that's a really,

1105
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:45.400
that's what they're doing up there is they're trying to protect people and they,

1106
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:47.830
they're not gonna throw any money at it,
so they're just going to say,
all right,

1107
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.580
no more of these dogs,
no more of these dogs.
Um,

1108
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.040
that's what they're doing.
So,
uh,
you know,

1109
01:06:57.041 --> 01:07:00.790
but I gotta be honest with you,
getting mauled to death by a fucking pit bull.

1110
01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:02.590
I mean,
do you want to go out like that?
I mean,
that's,

1111
01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:06.730
that's pretty fucking horrific.
Um,
but,
um,

1112
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.480
and then also horrific is them then killing every other pit bull out there.

1113
01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.770
So,
uh,
that,
that would be my suggestion is that,
you know,

1114
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.450
and if you are considering getting any dog,
I'm sure that there is,

1115
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:21.100
there's things that you could go out.
Like I,

1116
01:07:21.101 --> 01:07:25.990
that's the number one fucking thing that I wish I did because I absolutely

1117
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:30.250
fucking love animals.
I love dogs,
I fucking love him.

1118
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.140
And,
uh,
everything that I do,
you know,

1119
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:40.460
is probably wrong because the dog feels like it's on the same level as me and it

1120
01:07:40.461 --> 01:07:41.261
has to run shit.

1121
01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:45.160
And that's why people come through the door and it flips the fuck out and I have

1122
01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:48.640
to put the,
you know,
I just,
I just know how the dog is what I did.

1123
01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:51.640
I just adjusted to it.
I'm just like,
all right,
I know I'm having people over,

1124
01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.500
so I just take the dog downstairs and I just keep it in the room downstairs.

1125
01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:59.380
Nobody even sees the fucking thing.
Um,

1126
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.150
that's the way I had to operate with my dog.
And,
um,

1127
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.270
I can tell you that that's one way to do it,

1128
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:12.160
but it's not the way to do it because there's that constant anxiety of thinking,

1129
01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:15.530
well,
what if it ever got out?
What the fuck happened?
Oh my God,
blah,
blah,

1130
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:18.380
and I have to live with the guilt of someone else getting hurt.

1131
01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:20.930
And then I'd get the shit sued.
Autonomy.
I mean,
it's a,

1132
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:24.170
it's a really serious fucking thing when you get a German shepherd,

1133
01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:26.000
if you get a pit bull,
if you get a doberman pincher,

1134
01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:29.900
if you get a fucking golden retriever and then those dogs can fucking do damage.

1135
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:31.780
And the fact that you,
you just go,
oh my God,

1136
01:08:31.781 --> 01:08:35.210
it's cute and just take the fucking thing home.
Um,

1137
01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.800
forget about if you found it by the La River and you have no idea what the other

1138
01:08:38.801 --> 01:08:42.340
people did too.
What,
I mean,
I know my dog got abused.
I,
um,

1139
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.880
I picked up my hockey stick when I first got it and I was stick handling in the

1140
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:48.800
living room as you do.
Right.

1141
01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:51.680
And the dog immediately ran to the other side of the room.
And I was like,

1142
01:08:51.681 --> 01:08:54.740
oh my God,
somebody was hitting this thing with some sort of a stick.

1143
01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:58.700
So what I did was I just laid the hockey stick down in the middle of the room.

1144
01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:02.000
I went to the,
all the way on the opposite side of the room and I just,

1145
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:07.360
I'd call the dog over and the dog would come over and go all the way around the

1146
01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:10.770
stick and then come over,
lick me on my face and I go,

1147
01:09:10.771 --> 01:09:12.890
I go back to bed and it would go back to its bed.

1148
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:15.980
And each time it sniff to stick a little bit more,
a little bit more.

1149
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:20.390
And I just baby stepped up to the point where by the end of it I could,
you know,

1150
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:24.230
stick handling my garage,
you know,
with the tennis ball and shit.

1151
01:09:24.231 --> 01:09:29.210
And it didn't give a shit.
But,
um,
I wish I did that on other areas.
But,
uh,

1152
01:09:29.211 --> 01:09:34.160
I never,
once you see a dog going after somebody you never quite trusted again,

1153
01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:37.620
and then you have that fear and then they sense the fear and they process.

1154
01:09:37.621 --> 01:09:42.610
That is the fear is the person at the door and it's a fucking,
it's,
it's,

1155
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:46.580
I've learned so much by fucking up.
So my next dog,

1156
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:51.230
um,
I will not make those mistakes,
but,
um,

1157
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.400
I don't think that it is a problem with the breed.
I think it's,
uh,

1158
01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.680
it's the,
the,

1159
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.710
the size of the dog and the mistakes that I fucking made,
you know.
So anyways,

1160
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:08.390
moving on.
All right.
Moving to the states.
Uh,
he barely slept peg a,

1161
01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:12.470
I'm a 21 year old guy from Sweden and I'm thinking about moving to the u s but I

1162
01:10:12.471 --> 01:10:16.610
can't decide where I've narrowed it down to three cities,
New York,
San Francisco,

1163
01:10:16.611 --> 01:10:19.910
and La.
Great fucking choices.
So my simple question is,

1164
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:24.380
where do you think a guy in my age will have the most fun?

1165
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:30.110
Uh,
and by the way,
will your new specialty on Netflix?
Yes.
Yes.
It will be,
uh,

1166
01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.350
can't wait to see it in season two of F is for family.

1167
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.740
Hope you and Neil lives continue to be great.
Well thank you.
Uh,

1168
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:42.780
go fuck yourself and FTT.
I don't know what that means.
Fuck,

1169
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.270
fuck something or other.
Um,
all right.
Um,

1170
01:10:47.271 --> 01:10:49.010
it depends on what you want to do.
All right.

1171
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:54.011
You are going to get fucking laid in all three of those cities coming over.

1172
01:10:54.561 --> 01:10:58.360
They're Swedish guy.
You Go,
you can speak fucking another language in itself.

1173
01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.190
It's a fucking rap.
You could have an accent,
you know,
it's a wrap.

1174
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:04.610
You're going to get laid.
It all depends on,
uh,

1175
01:11:04.611 --> 01:11:07.430
what type of women you're in and what kind of weather you like.

1176
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.880
If you can deal with the winter,
I would say go to New York City.

1177
01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.030
New York City is the Paris,
the United States.
It's the best one we have

1178
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:21.750
is far as like,
just culturally.
It's just fucking amazing.
Um,

1179
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.220
San Francisco is,
is fucking unbelievable too.

1180
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.910
Like the f the first of all,
the food in all three of these are unbelievable.

1181
01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:34.560
San Francisco is going to be the most expensive,
believe it or not.
Um,

1182
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.870
all that computer money I guess is fucking ruined that city.
Um,

1183
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.020
then New York and La is actually starting to,
you know,

1184
01:11:42.021 --> 01:11:46.350
get really expensive to,
um,
la brutal fucking traffic.

1185
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.930
Uh,
there is a drought and,
uh,
uh,
what would I do?

1186
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:54.070
21.
You know what,
man?
I,
I,
I,

1187
01:11:54.071 --> 01:11:59.070
I think I would go with New York just because if you want to go back and visit

1188
01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.780
it,
you're cutting out like five hours of the flight.
Um,

1189
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:07.950
when you were in New York,
I would visit San Francisco in La,

1190
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.990
you know,
uh,
but you know,
don't sleep on others,
other bunch of greats.
Madison,

1191
01:12:12.991 --> 01:12:17.460
Wisconsin's fucking great.
Pittsburgh's the shit.
Cleveland's coming around,

1192
01:12:17.461 --> 01:12:20.760
you know,
every time I go there it's getting fucking better and better.
Um,

1193
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:25.290
I love all those fucking rust belt cities.
Um,
Chicago's to shit.

1194
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.020
Nashville,
New Orleans,
there's so many fucking places to go,

1195
01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.950
so many fucking places to go.
Uh,
but I think New York is a great place.

1196
01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:39.030
It's a great place.
You know,
and there's a lot of liberal New York's there.

1197
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:42.780
New York is there,
and they just think anything from another country,
especially,

1198
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.273
um,

1199
01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.870
any country from Europe is just automatically better and more amazing.

1200
01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:52.320
So you know when you'll be a good person for them to fucking sit there shit on

1201
01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:53.610
the United States,
it's like,

1202
01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:57.540
you guys put your shoes on this way and we do it there.
Where it was like,

1203
01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:57.861
I was this,

1204
01:12:57.861 --> 01:13:01.170
my wife listens to NPR and they were sitting there talking about how in one of

1205
01:13:01.171 --> 01:13:03.220
those fucking,
you know,

1206
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.850
countries over there where they have a million people on bicycles,

1207
01:13:05.851 --> 01:13:09.000
no one really gets fucked over by someone opening the car door into them.

1208
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.511
You know,

1209
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:12.960
when they parked because they have this thing called the fucking whatever they

1210
01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:15.510
opened,
they opened the door with their right hand.

1211
01:13:15.511 --> 01:13:18.840
So that gets them to look over their shoulder and they acted like it was just

1212
01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:22.890
astounding fucking achievement.
And why didn't we ever think of that?

1213
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.280
I'll tell you why we never thought of it because no one rides a fucking bike

1214
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:30.690
over here.
90% of people do not ride bicycles over there.

1215
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.850
Everybody rides a fucking bike.
Just about,

1216
01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:36.120
most people can't even afford a fucking car.
They have bike lanes.

1217
01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:39.750
It's a part of how they grow up.
That's the only reason why.
It's like,

1218
01:13:39.751 --> 01:13:42.990
I never used to look for motorcycle riders until I rode a motorcycle.

1219
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:48.240
And then now I always,
you know,
I creep over to the left,
let him drive along,

1220
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:51.690
you know,
in between.
I always make sure I'm looking for him,
you know,

1221
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:56.100
and I never did that before I wrote.
So anyways,
I'm off on a tangent here.
Okay.

1222
01:13:56.101 --> 01:13:59.790
Friend being taking advantage of at a fire station.

1223
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:02.101
The fuck,

1224
01:14:02.101 --> 01:14:04.980
does this mean they're making them cook all the Chili or are we talking molested

1225
01:14:04.981 --> 01:14:06.480
here?
Dear Mr Burn,

1226
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.900
a good friend of mine is trying to be a firefighter and I feel like he's totally

1227
01:14:09.901 --> 01:14:14.440
become their bitch and instead of being hired full time is fire department has

1228
01:14:14.441 --> 01:14:18.940
him hired as like a reserve or whatever and it hasn't working full time hours,

1229
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:22.000
basically.
That would be nice.
But since he's a reserve,

1230
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.540
he's literally getting paid like below minimum wage.
Uh,

1231
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:27.880
he's been doing this for around a year or so,

1232
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:31.120
and the department he's in definitely is understaffed.

1233
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:34.000
They just don't want to make them full time because they would have to pay him

1234
01:14:34.001 --> 01:14:38.860
an actual salary.
Now,
I don't know anything about jobs and careers and stuff,

1235
01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:42.010
but I feel like he's definitely getting taken advantage of.
What should I do?

1236
01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:43.600
Should I tell him he's being fucked over?

1237
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.000
We'd love to hear your opinion on the matter of love.
The podcast.

1238
01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:47.920
Can't wait for ups,
for family.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1239
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.340
And when are you coming to northern California?
Um,
all right.

1240
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:57.520
Um,
I would say,
uh,
I would just say to them and say,
Hey,
listen,

1241
01:14:57.521 --> 01:15:01.870
you know,
I know that,
you know,
I would just bring up work.
How's it going at work?

1242
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.980
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1243
01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:06.100
Do they have any plans and making your fulltime anytime soon.

1244
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:11.740
Listen to what he says and then just ask them,
well,
you know how,
how long,
uh,

1245
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.550
so what are you,
what,
so what's the game plan?
Do they have,

1246
01:15:15.551 --> 01:15:19.300
they hinted anything about it and just see what he says.
Sometimes it's hard.

1247
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:21.310
You got to let your friends learn hard lessons.

1248
01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.550
Sometimes you just got to kind of let them get fucked over.
I mean,

1249
01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:28.450
just bring it up,
see what the person says.
And uh,

1250
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.540
hopefully your friend isn't like that guy in the joke,
in Goodfellas,
you know,

1251
01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:35.230
that just
means he's content to be a jerk.

1252
01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:40.150
What am I going to say that my,
my wife two times me.
Um,
yeah,

1253
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:41.590
that's what I would do.
I would just bring it up.

1254
01:15:41.591 --> 01:15:46.000
I've had friends in those situations and uh,
you know,
that can be very difficult.

1255
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:51.520
Um,
yeah,
so that's what I would do.
That's a simple one.
Just bring it up,

1256
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:53.340
ask them how they're going and say,

1257
01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:57.490
ask them if they have any plans and then I would say,
so,
you know,

1258
01:15:57.491 --> 01:15:59.590
not trying to be nosy,
you'll just looking out for,
you know,

1259
01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:03.550
cause I want to see you succeed.
What w what is your plan then?
Because,
uh,

1260
01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:07.240
there are other firehouses out there where you could maybe get hired on.

1261
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:12.130
All Right,
Jim Irsay guitar collection.
Oh Jesus,
my buddy Jim.
Or say,

1262
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.170
hey Billy B.
Bender.
I was reading the guitar,

1263
01:16:17.171 --> 01:16:20.920
a fixed [inaudible] fixed you natl magazine this month and there was an article

1264
01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.980
article about Warren Hayes playing Jerry Garcia's guitar tiger at red rocks a

1265
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.670
few months back.

1266
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:32.230
This was the last guitar Jerry ever played live before his untimely death.

1267
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:34.090
Anyways,
long story short,

1268
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:38.020
the article went on to disclose jimmer say was the actual owner of the guitar.

1269
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:42.910
Well that's what happens with most,
most of those instruments,

1270
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.180
they are owned by rich people who are not musicians.

1271
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:49.900
I'm not saying they're not lovers of music,
but um,

1272
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:53.560
that's where it all ends up.
And then actual musicians,

1273
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:57.100
they buy their own gear and then they make that gear legendary.

1274
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:00.970
You know what I mean?
I was,
I was,
you know,
I did that shit.

1275
01:17:00.971 --> 01:17:05.170
I bought a 71 Ludwig green sparkled John Bonham fucking kit.
Like,

1276
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.270
so then what?
Now I'm going to play like him.

1277
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:12.390
That was an expensive lesson to learn,
you know.

1278
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.470
But I know there's some other kid,
you know,

1279
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:20.471
going down to fucking a pro drum shop out here in la and he's going to buy a

1280
01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:25.100
fucking kit that's a particular color.
And everything,

1281
01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:26.360
and t's going to tune them up,

1282
01:17:26.361 --> 01:17:29.060
or she's going to do it and they're going to have a sound and they're going to

1283
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:31.820
put it together,
and then everybody's going to want that kit.

1284
01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:36.560
So it doesn't surprise me.
I mean,
he owns a team in the NFL.

1285
01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:38.770
This guy's a fucking billionaire,
right?
Um,

1286
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:42.440
he said he paid $850,000 forward at auction.

1287
01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.870
And you know what's great about Jim or say money

1288
01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:50.900
is if he's a fucking billionaire,
all right?
Even if,
even if you fucking,

1289
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:53.450
if you had,
if you had a hundred million bucks,

1290
01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:58.690
spending $850,000 is spending less than 1% of your fucking money.

1291
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.633
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1292
01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.800
<v 1>But if you're a billionaire,
then what is the fucking decimal point moves over?</v>

1293
01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.020
One more.
Is that it?
Is it 0.01% less than that?
I don't know.

1294
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.470
He said he paid in a 50,000,
40 to auction.
Not to mention,

1295
01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:18.300
he also owns Bob Dylan stratocaster from the Newport festival.

1296
01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:22.650
George Harrison's Gibson,
s g,
Jesus.

1297
01:18:22.651 --> 01:18:26.820
What a fucking collection.
And even prince is yellow cloud guitar.

1298
01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.340
Although I appreciate someone preserving musical history like he has as a

1299
01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:34.590
longtime guitarist and patriots fan,

1300
01:18:34.591 --> 01:18:39.540
I say fuck him for not allowing these guitars to be in the hands of musicians.

1301
01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:40.890
What are your thoughts?
Um,

1302
01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:46.100
I separate jimmer say the football loner when you start talking about his guitar

1303
01:18:46.741 --> 01:18:49.050
collection,
then he's just a regular person to me.
You know what I mean?

1304
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:54.720
So He's just a rich guy that he's a music lover and I don't think they should

1305
01:18:54.721 --> 01:18:59.200
necessarily be in the hands of musicians because,
um,

1306
01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:05.620
I think that you should be influenced by great artists not go out and try to do

1307
01:19:07.311 --> 01:19:12.140
what they already did.
I think the fact that you as a musician will go out,

1308
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:16.970
you know,
like I,
I,
if I was a musician,
my goal would be like,

1309
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:21.780
I would want my guitar to be famous too.
Like how Stevie Ray Vaughn,

1310
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.020
you know what John Bonham's vista light kit became famous.
Like none of the,

1311
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:28.700
none of those things were famous.

1312
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.150
No one knew what they look like until they got into the hands of those

1313
01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:34.910
unbelievable artists.
So,
um,

1314
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:36.370
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1315
01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:37.490
<v 1>I think that the reason,</v>

1316
01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.420
the fact that they go for all that money and they ended up in rich people's

1317
01:19:40.421 --> 01:19:40.840
hands,

1318
01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.840
it's just a testament to the greatness of the musician and how music affects

1319
01:19:47.711 --> 01:19:52.060
people.
Even a guy who was a fucking NFL owner,
the fact that he's into the dead,

1320
01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:56.440
he's into George Harrison,
he's into prince,
he's into Bob Dylan.

1321
01:19:56.441 --> 01:19:59.230
I mean that he can't fuck with any of those influences.

1322
01:19:59.231 --> 01:20:02.530
The guys got good taste in music,
you know?
Um,

1323
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:04.200
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1324
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.130
<v 1>but there's no magic in those guitars though.
I mean,</v>

1325
01:20:08.131 --> 01:20:11.400
I could literally have Bonham's kit and I'm going to sound like a comedian

1326
01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:13.560
playing drums and you guys are all going to be like,
Hey,

1327
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:17.940
can you get fucking knock it off?
You know what I mean?
So I don't think that the,

1328
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:22.920
I think that they,
um,
they just like pieces of history now.

1329
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:27.700
I think like a,
if you have like fucking Napoleon Sword,
I don't think that,

1330
01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:31.790
oh,
well that should be in some motherfucking dictators hands chopping somebody

1331
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.520
fucking head off.
I mean,
I don't think so.
I just think that,
uh,

1332
01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:39.600
if you're into that type of shit,
which I totally am,

1333
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:42.280
I'm completely into memory of bill,

1334
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.570
but I refuse to buy any because so much of it is fake.

1335
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.640
And also,
um,
I just have enough shit in my fucking house.

1336
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.660
I don't need any more shit in my house.
And,
uh,
I also,

1337
01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:59.670
I don't want my fucking house to look like a fucking a fucking hard rock cafe.

1338
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:01.733
You know what I mean?

1339
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.040
When I got fucking Jim Morrison's fucking me undies on the wall framed,
you know,

1340
01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.250
and they'll probably some guy in it's probably jives better chance of being

1341
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:15.000
jimmer say's fucking me undies and Jim Morrison.
So,
um,
yeah,

1342
01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:18.330
I don't begrudge him and um,
I think it's,

1343
01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:22.560
I think that's fucking awesome that he has it because,
uh,

1344
01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:26.640
well I guess then that's why musicians to put maybe,
I dunno,

1345
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:31.110
there is something cool to touch the thing.
Like if you could ever like,

1346
01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:34.650
just hold that debt Jimmy Page,

1347
01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:37.970
double neck SG that he played stairway to heaven on.

1348
01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.050
If you could just fucking hold that thing and just feel like,
like I,

1349
01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:44.580
I think and you'd just start whispering when you had it.
Like,
oh my God,

1350
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:48.810
it says he looked at John Bottom and we'll give him the nod when he was coming

1351
01:21:48.811 --> 01:21:50.280
out of the song,
you know?
Okay.

1352
01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:52.030
That was probably creepy lists and be fucking whisper the I,

1353
01:21:52.031 --> 01:21:54.780
I would be like that around that shit.
But I'm a man.

1354
01:21:54.781 --> 01:21:59.520
If you've got the fucking money,
you know they can have it.
So there you go,
man.

1355
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:02.400
Go make your guitar fucking legendary and then see how much Jim are.

1356
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:05.700
Say We'll pay for yours.
You know?
But then again,
you'd have to be dead.
Well,

1357
01:22:05.701 --> 01:22:08.490
Bob Dylan is not dead when you give it up for auction.

1358
01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:13.050
My dog right now is sitting just to the left of my computer.

1359
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:15.870
She staring intensely at me.
She's been fed,

1360
01:22:15.871 --> 01:22:17.460
she's been out and everything like that.

1361
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:20.100
And all that says that she wants to be let up on the couch.
And you know what?

1362
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.950
I can't do it.
I'm going to turn it around.

1363
01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:27.030
I'm too weak or cameras that she's too fucking adorable.

1364
01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:30.390
Why is your head shaped like a fucking muscular light bulb?

1365
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:33.810
You ever notice that your little bear faith?
Huh?

1366
01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.330
Why can't you be like this with company?

1367
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:39.510
Why can't you see that I'm relaxed around them and then you are relaxed.

1368
01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:43.850
Why do you treat everybody like they're a fucking axe murderer?
Huh?

1369
01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:49.410
All right.
That's the podcasts.
Um,
go fuck yourselves.
And uh,

1370
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:51.061
can I got to say again?

1371
01:22:51.061 --> 01:22:53.670
Congratulations to bill and that they're turning that fucking thing around
there.

1372
01:22:53.671 --> 01:22:54.720
I always liked the bills back.

1373
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:57.420
I don't like their fucking fans cause I had a bad experience when I went out

1374
01:22:57.421 --> 01:22:59.190
there and we're a patriots hat and this they,
you know,

1375
01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.540
three fucking people when I was taking a piss pushed me fucking pussies.

1376
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.950
Um,
but anyways,
a hell.

1377
01:23:05.951 --> 01:23:08.890
So I had a fucking patriots hat on in their stadium and I had my dick out.

1378
01:23:08.891 --> 01:23:10.840
What the fuck was I thinking?
Gimme Jesus Christ.

1379
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:14.010
Why don't I just slip my own throat?
But I,
I liked him from back,
you know,

1380
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:18.280
Joe Ferguson,
Oj Simpson and all those days and it was always snowing.
And,
uh,

1381
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:21.130
I always like the buffalo bills from back then self.
That's what happens.
You,

1382
01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:22.990
you start to like a team when you're a kid,
you know,

1383
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.710
even when they become your rival,
you don't give a fuck.
So,
uh,

1384
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.340
psych Tom Brady's coming back and I'm just going to say a bunch of shit that I

1385
01:23:30.341 --> 01:23:33.550
already said.
All right,
go fuck yourselves.
And I'll check on Thursday.
