00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn?
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.350
July 27th,
2015 how's it going out?

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
<v 1>Yeah,
July.</v>

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.090
Where's the fucking summer going kit.

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.880
<v 0>Okay,
Jodie.
You know what I want to get,
I want to get some of that fucking,</v>

6
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:25.160
how's that politician on the beer?

7
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:28.340
The Sam Adams Summer Ale kid,
right.

8
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:32.540
I drank the summer ale in the summer.
Right in the fall.

9
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.880
I drink the one with the fucking cherries in it.

10
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:38.930
And then the rest of the time I just drink their regular lug.
Yeah.

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.990
What's up everybody?
So old Billy red cakes.
Oh,

12
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:47.560
red velvet here.
He's been trying to lose weight.
[inaudible]

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.770
let's go freckles.
You fucking do shit.
Go get a Tan.

14
00:00:53.771 --> 00:00:58.770
No wants to see your fucking pasty legs at the beach.
Um,

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.570
so last week I was supposed to be 180 pounds,

16
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.040
but I was not in the fulfillment of a,
of a,
of a scale.
And by the way,

17
00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:10.720
somebody gave me shit like,
dude,

18
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:15.100
what kind of fucking respectable hotel doesn't have a scale?

19
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.720
It doesn't have a scale where you like that.
That comes standards where you were.

20
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:24.190
You stay.
Where are you staying at?
Huh?
You staying at the old Illuminati Yen?

21
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.620
Huh?
Did some broad come in wearing some fucking weird mask?
I'll fucking naked.

22
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.070
One of those fucking perfectly shaped broads like you see in the movie by the

23
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:37.030
guy who did the eyes wide shut was wandering to Stanley Kubrick.

24
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.210
Stanley Kubrick has some of the hottest broads ever in the history of film in

25
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:46.810
his movies ever.
Ever.
You know,

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
it's just a shame.
Horrible Shit happens to them,
but you,
you know,

27
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:52.540
in the midst of the horror he like got,
damn,
that's a beautiful woman.

28
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.870
Then I think that really speaks to the beauty of a woman.

29
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:58.330
That's something horror.
Look,
it'd be happening where you're like,
wow,

30
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.760
she looks like a fucking statue with a muff.
All right.

31
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.470
They never have the muffs and statues.

32
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:11.080
If you noticed that it's a little difficult with the concrete,

33
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:12.710
what are you going to do?
Huh?

34
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.970
Have somebody with long fingernails kind of come up while this concrete still

35
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:19.750
wet and just kind of,
Hey,
do one of those right in the old crotch area.

36
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.680
How does that go,
Bill?
It goes,
that's how you do it.
That's how you make it.

37
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.760
You know,

38
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.380
I took a sculpture class just like old Adolf Hitler did Denise or he'd take a

39
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:32.200
painting class.
I don't know what he did.

40
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.710
And it just always makes me kind of smile thinking there was a point in his life

41
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.990
where he was just thinking he was going to be an artist,
you know,

42
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.400
sitting there with an Easel,
you know what I mean?
Paint some ducks,

43
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.170
you know,
by a pond.
And then who knows?
Maybe a,

44
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.170
somebody Jewish walked by and sneezed and scare the ducks and it just,

45
00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:54.190
he just fucking snapped and just send them,
just set it down a whole lot of rope,

46
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.560
you know?
Does anybody explored that theory?
Oh,

47
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.300
that was offensive to ducks and Jewish people.
Oh,

48
00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:06.530
this is blog is going to be easy.
Um,

49
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.810
so anyways,
I'm sitting here in my office.

50
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.270
I'm fucking hot as hell.
I got to close the windows on the counter.
I swear a lot.

51
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.360
You know what I mean?
And I would want to offend the people next door.

52
00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:23.810
God knows I could reach out and touch their fucking house.
Free Cha,

53
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.680
reach out and touch my house.
So fucking stupid.

54
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:31.040
This is such a fucking stupid city I live in is a city,

55
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:35.450
yet I live in a house in a city,
you know,
and I have a Yad,

56
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.780
but I,
but I don't know what I mean.

57
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.230
Get up the drapes closed people just walking by looking at you and shit.

58
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.020
Um,
so anyways,
I'm back here.
So anyways,

59
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.270
I was supposed to get down to 180 fucking pounds.
I couldn't weigh myself.

60
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.760
Last week I was at the just for laughs festival.

61
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.650
The booze was flowing all right.
And I stayed away.

62
00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.910
<v 0>What's that fucking grunts or stay away</v>

64
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.330
was Alison change off a jar?
Flies,
I believe.
Wow.

65
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:11.970
That takes me back in the day.
Hey,
let's,

66
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.900
let's go down this add fucking stream before I get to my official way.
And,

67
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.410
um,
I used to listen to that fucking

68
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.760
dead fucking cassette tape when I would be driving in my 83 Ford Ranger with the

69
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:27.930
re rebuilt Ford cylinder.

70
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:30.510
That the broad I work with told me that was a dumb move.

71
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.200
She was all excited that I was going to buy a new car and my brother told me,

72
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:37.170
don't do that.
Then you change your day job.
You don't want to fucking do that.

73
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:39.530
So I didn't,
I rebuilt it.
I didn't rebuild it.

74
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.700
Had somebody else put a brand new one and that's what happened.

75
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:45.600
The other one fucking burned up.
So I fucking had a brand new one put in,

76
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.500
cost me 1500 bucks at the time.
This is the early nineties.

77
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.430
I still remember that woman when I went to work.
She's like,
where's the new car?

78
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:56.390
I said,
Oh,
you know what?
I decided to put a new engine in my truck instead.

79
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.480
She just like made this what the fuck?
Look and just wrinkled her nose and went,

80
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.570
that was stupid.
Um,

81
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.240
was it,
was it stupid?

82
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.930
Maybe I don't want to stay at a wearing this smock for the rest of my life.

83
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:16.440
All right.
With your fucking whatever you got there,
what was it,

84
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.260
the Nissan Power Ranger.
What did they make in the early 80 stare at?

85
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:24.090
Everybody loved the Maxima.
You get it.
You're taking it to the Max.

86
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.180
To your mom Maxima.

87
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.530
Next of my [inaudible] I can't afford the payments.
Can you take over?

88
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.700
I got fired for smoking weed on the door,
right?
I did a little blow.
Okay.

89
00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:41.420
I stayed out off.
Fuck,
I will.

90
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.260
Um,
that's what you hear in Boston when the windows ain't closed.

91
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.530
So anyways,
uh,
what was I saying?

92
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:55.450
So I used to fucking drive that thing and um,
oh man,

93
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:56.380
those are the fucking days.

94
00:05:56.381 --> 00:06:01.250
And I would do fucking Dick Doherty's roam up and drink it.
I do the high five,

95
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.780
this restaurant on top of the only skyscraper and fucking Manchester,

96
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.950
New Hampshire or the other fucking the other town there.
What's the other town?

97
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:11.600
There's two towns in fucking New Hampshire.

98
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.430
The rest of it is fucking beautiful woods.

99
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.200
Strange's probably a lot of people doing heroin.
Heroin's back in a big way.
Hey,

100
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.550
tell you this kid has been on stage in wells spring up.
Um,

101
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.520
the other one,
Nashua see them,
I think it was in Manchester.
I do the high five.

102
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.170
I used to do Bob,
my fucking roam on old orchard beach.

103
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:37.430
And I used to fucking listen to that cassette tape over and over and over again

104
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:38.360
the whole way down.
In fact,

105
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:42.680
I remember coming back down down one 28 head and back down to my house.

106
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.940
I had to work the next fucking day,
driving like 80 miles an hour.

107
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.970
And then all of a sudden I got a fucking flat Tahlia and I'm pulling over on the

108
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:53.791
side of the fucking row.

109
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:57.090
One of the scary seats you can do on the highway pulled over.
And uh,

110
00:06:57.091 --> 00:07:00.200
all they had was that,
you know,
that little fucking,
you know,

111
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:03.170
that awful poor excuse for a fucking tire iron,
you know,

112
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.680
it's just like the little,
uh,
when he cut,
you could fit it right up your sleeve,

113
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.600
a little l shape fucking thing.

114
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:11.390
And I knew I didn't have enough leverage because I had been there before.

115
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:15.560
So I always had a section of pipe behind the seat and a dude.

116
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.960
I changed that thing like I don't think a pit crew,

117
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.220
well actually a pit cook would do it,

118
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:23.480
but for one person I changed that fucking tire so God damn fast and on the side

119
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.910
of the road I had my spare in the back of the truck,

120
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.370
you know that section of pipe fucking four lugs.
I used to have that down.

121
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.510
I had so many fucking flats over the years and that they was such a piece of

122
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:40.070
shit.
That truck that I had knew the whole fucking routine.
You know,

123
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.880
take out your spare tire,
sticking under the car,
you know,

124
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.450
a little bit in case it comes slamming fucking down and hits the tire and not

125
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:49.100
your foot,
right.

126
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.660
Loosen all the fucking lugs with your section of pipe on your little fucking l

127
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:57.080
shape thing before your race,
that fucking truck.

128
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.550
Then you jack it up.
All right,
you take the fucker off,
you stick,
you know,

129
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:04.640
and I used to put the lugs right in a row.
There was no cell phones.

130
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.320
I didn't have a flashlight.
I had fucking nothing.

131
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:08.120
I'd line them right up in the back of the truck.

132
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.640
I used to pray to God that had happened on the right side.

133
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.520
Like that was a good night.
And you stick the fucker back on.

134
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.250
You start all four of them.
You set the thing back down and your web,
what Bass,

135
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:19.890
what bash with passion.
Then you're back in the fucking truck failing.
Like

136
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.740
anyways.
So what was I talking?
I was talking about how I go,

137
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.860
how much weight I lost.
So,
um,
so I was supposed to be at one 80 last week.

138
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:35.861
Did not have a scale because evidently I stay in shitty hotels and a this week I

139
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:39.090
was supposed to be one 77.
All right.

140
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.220
And I fucking worked out the whole time I was up in Montreal,

141
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.890
I ran the stairs,
royal park,
whatever the fuck they call it.
Um,

142
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.780
ran those almost every day or as long as I could.

143
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.550
I took one day off and a,

144
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.320
but that day I played hockey and absolutely fucking embarrass myself.
Oh my,

145
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.710
I hadn't played hockey and like four months and I already sucked.

146
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.260
And I went out there and just for laughs,

147
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.360
knew this guy who used to play for the fucking Canadians and he looks like a

148
00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:11.410
fucking movie star.
Come on.
Habs fans,
you know he is,

149
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.550
Huh?
First number four,

150
00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:18.640
second number four later traded to the devils.

151
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.170
He's got this fucking sick ass like little mini rink.
So anyways,
we,

152
00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:26.020
Stefan reshape.
So we fucking shell up and I'm going,
oh my God,

153
00:09:26.021 --> 00:09:30.920
this fucking Stefan Rache he used to kill us.
And um,

154
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.270
so we played in like the other team was just a bunch of ringers and they came

155
00:09:34.271 --> 00:09:35.830
out there and like my first shift,

156
00:09:35.831 --> 00:09:38.860
I think I was on the ice for like fucking three seconds and they scored,

157
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.860
you know,
and I'm coming back and immediately everybody knows.

158
00:09:41.861 --> 00:09:45.190
They already knew I sucked.
But now like they now it's like they have like,

159
00:09:45.191 --> 00:09:48.630
they know how much I suck,
right.
And,
uh,
they,
they,

160
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.600
the other team scored like fucking three goals within.
Um,

161
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:53.800
<v 3>okay.</v>

162
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.400
<v 0>I don't know,
maybe a minute.
And uh,</v>

163
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.140
then all of a sudden we got like two and then blah,
blah,
blah.

164
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:03.440
Then they were up like eight to five and then dot.
And then people,
you know,

165
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.060
this is basic what happened.

166
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.660
They realized that they will way better and they were nice enough to let us win

167
00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:13.280
by one.
That's what happened.
I think we won like 13 to 12.

168
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.900
Um,
it was a good time.
I had zero shots on net.
Never fell down though.

169
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.820
I know it went down right.
Have enough weed out.
But I was,
I was,
uh,

170
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.920
I was awful.
Oh Man.

171
00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:29.650
I should have skated at least once before I went up there and um,
but whatever,

172
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.830
I burned some calories.
Uh,

173
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.550
but thank you to everybody there at the rink that let us play out there.

174
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.070
I had a great,
despite the fact that I was fucking horrific,

175
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:40.100
I had a great time and uh,
I don't know,

176
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:42.670
hockey plays it just fucking funny guys to hang out with.
Anyways,

177
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.130
everybody was busting balls in that type of shit.
And you know,

178
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.790
guys coming into the face off,
I'm going up against all freckles,
you know,

179
00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:53.570
giving me shit.
And then they go right around me and you know what?

180
00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:56.090
There was nothing I could do about it.

181
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.450
So thanks to everybody hooking it up and thank you to the other team for letting

182
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:03.800
us win by one or two,
whatever you did.
It's very nicely,
very hospitable.

183
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:09.060
So anyways,
so now I come back
and uh,

184
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.060
I stepped on the scale this morning.
It's Sunday.

185
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.500
I was supposed to be one 80 last week and one 77 this week.

186
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.320
And I got on the scale.

187
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.710
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

188
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.400
<v 0>And my weight was 180 pounds even.</v>

189
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.220
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

190
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.140
<v 0>So,
so I'm three pounds behind.</v>

191
00:11:29.141 --> 00:11:30.460
What the fuck I wanted to do,

192
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.910
however I was 81 86.6 when I started this fucking thing.

193
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.873
So,

194
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.030
<v 3>okay.</v>

195
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.870
<v 0>What does a quitter do?
Huh?</v>

196
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.960
What does a quitter do besides take off her horse shoes and walk barefoot back

197
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:50.961
to the fucking hotel room across the casino floor with dirty ass fucking feet.

198
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.690
What else does a quitter do?
Acquired.
It goes like,
wow,

199
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.230
I was supposed to be one 77 and I'm one 80 forget it.

200
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.730
Fuck that last week was a wash for me.
All right,

201
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.340
I'll consider that a bye week cause I was on the road.

202
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.260
So next week I got to get down to one 77 who gives a fuck as long as I reach my

203
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:15.850
goal of getting down to 162 pounds.
The last time I had abs.

204
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.590
All right,
this is my last big push.
I'm turning 50 in three fucking years.

205
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.510
He's my last hope.

206
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:27.511
Nobody has abs in their 50s unless you did heroin in your 20s and that's a fact.

207
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.870
And you can fucking look it up.
Look at Keith Richards.
So get a fucking shape.

208
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:35.680
That guy said,
despite his horrific habits,

209
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.830
tremendous shape.
You know all those fucking guys.

210
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.090
Anybody who did the fucking smack.
The key is,

211
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:44.710
is not to Odi and die.

212
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.080
You get clean and I dunno what it is,
man,
the rest of your fucking life,

213
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.940
just like he just have an orange and like you,

214
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.440
if you're full for fucking 10 hours,
I have no idea how they do it.
Um,

215
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.340
I don't want to sound out and people that did heroin,

216
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:04.150
well let's just say if you do hard drugs in general,
you know,

217
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.180
look at what's his face there from that band,
you know,

218
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:11.550
that had the puppets on the cover.
You know what I'm talking about?
Ah,

219
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.160
yams get him
right.

220
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.790
He's fucking skinny as shit and he's pushing 60,
uh,

221
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.860
I'm not advocating doing heroin.

222
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.400
I'm just talking about having an abs in your 50s.
I'm doing it.
Oh.

223
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.150
Naturale so no heroin.
Um,
so anyways,

224
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:35.260
I feel though I do feel by tomorrow Monday,
which you listen to now,

225
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:40.030
not to fuck you up.
I will be one 79,
so I'm only like two pounds behind.
Um,

226
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:43.930
so when I keep doing it as I keep switching up the fucking workout and uh,

227
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.380
Bert fucking Kreischer was nice enough to send me something about grip strength,

228
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.740
but one of those men's magazines that,
um,

229
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.210
I can never commit to having a subscription to cause it's just the same thing

230
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:01.090
over.
And like all those men's health magazines,
you know what?

231
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.700
They're just like cosmo.
If you really look at the covers,

232
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:08.230
it's the same shit every,
every fucking episode or whatever you call every issue.

233
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.820
COSMO's always some fucking hot fucking air brush broad,

234
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.760
right?
There's something else,
you know,

235
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.590
so and so's most in depth a fucking interview ever.

236
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.550
She's finally found happiness,
right?
Or whatever.
And then there's always,

237
00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:27.070
you know,
either how to get your man,

238
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:30.760
how do you know if your man's fucking around how to really please you man,

239
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:33.310
how to get your man to please you one on one of those fucking articles.

240
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:35.440
And then on the men's one,
all right,

241
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.160
they always got some guy who's kind of famous,
right?

242
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.060
Who shredded airbrushed and all of that shit.

243
00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:47.050
And it's always hard to get abs and fucking 20 days,
uh,

244
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.920
the Cirque de Solei Diet or some fuck some fucking diet.
And then,

245
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.001
oh,

246
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:58.001
some new new new fucking arm workout that's going to explode your biceps

247
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:01.250
assumption.
It's all the same fucking crap.
You know what you gotta do?
All right?

248
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.560
You fucking eat.
Eat.
Well,
the beginning of the day,

249
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:06.530
you have your fruits before fucking 12,
and then after that you go Veggie,

250
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.700
you have your fucking meat that the size of the palm behavior even remotely near

251
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:12.200
that.
And you're working out.

252
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:15.950
If you're doing half hour of fucking cardio and you lay off the booze,

253
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:18.200
the ice cream,
the chips,
the cookies and all that shit,

254
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.790
where is it going to get a fence?
Got Nowhere to hide it turned the lights on,

255
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:25.820
the roaches all fucking starts scurrying.
Did I?

256
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.510
That's the first time ever you scurrying at fucking eight years of doing a

257
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:33.230
podcast.
You know what you gotta do?
You don't need those fucking magazines,

258
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:35.090
but every once in a while you get bored with your workout.

259
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:37.760
You want something new.
So Bert Kreischer sent me this thing.

260
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.640
I'm going to go back on my Twitter history and try and find it.

261
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.320
But he sent me this killer fucking um,
grip strength workout.

262
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.791
And uh,

263
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:51.390
one of the first thing is you just try to hang from a chin up bar in the pullup

264
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.520
position for fucking a minute,
three sets of one minute.

265
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.660
And um,
the key to that is just hang there.

266
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.270
What I was doing was I was kind of in like a,

267
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.230
like a fucking the first third of a pull up so I was burning out.

268
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.210
But if you just hang it,
it's not that fucking hard.

269
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.780
So now I've moved to the next one,
which is you,
you do it again for a minute,

270
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:16.490
but you hang in there holding the bar with one hand and the other one you drape

271
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:20.870
some sort of cloth,
you know,
whatever.
If you're in your garage like me,

272
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.380
the fucking rag,
he used to fucking check your oil,

273
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.420
which is probably stupid cause there's oil on it,
whatever.

274
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:30.290
That helps with the grip strength and that one you hold,
you just drape it over.

275
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:31.490
Just some sort of face cloth.

276
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.800
You drape that over and you're hanging onto that with one hand,

277
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.240
the other hands on the bar,

278
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:38.600
you try to do it for a minute and then you switch hands.
And,
uh,

279
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.580
I've been able to do it for a minute on one side and then the other side,

280
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:46.640
I did it for about 45 seconds.
That's where I'm at on that thing.

281
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.990
And then of course,
you're like,
well,

282
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:50.930
let me put two up there and see if I can just hang by two fucking rags.

283
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:55.130
And I almost broke both my knee caps.
That's hard as shit for me anyways,

284
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.590
you know,
so that's what the fuck I'm at.

285
00:16:57.591 --> 00:17:02.591
So I'm going to get down to one 77 next week by hook or by Crook and I'm,

286
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.130
I'm hanging in there with the boosts 21 days,
no booze.

287
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:11.870
I'm getting to the point of,
hey,
you know,
it gives a fuck.
I was kidding.
No,

288
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.020
I can't wait for September 15th.
September.

289
00:17:14.021 --> 00:17:17.830
It was September 16th is when I can boost.
That's when I can,
uh,

290
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.030
I can booze again.
But,
uh,
I got to tell you,
um,

291
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.080
the hardest place for me to not booze actually is my house.

292
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.000
You know why?
Cause I got the good shit.
You know,
you go into a fucking bar.

293
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:32.781
What am I going to do out there?

294
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:35.960
I'm married so I don't give a shit about the women out there,
you know?

295
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.910
And then I got to spend 10 times,

296
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:41.410
what am I going to pay at home and I'm going to drink,

297
00:17:41.411 --> 00:17:44.690
eat fucking cheap boots,
right?

298
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.980
Why the fuck would I do that?
In fact,
all you youngsters out,

299
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.130
I know,
cause you give you a union what?
You're single,

300
00:17:52.131 --> 00:17:53.030
you want to get laid or whatever.

301
00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:55.430
But if you really want to go out for a fucking night of drinking,

302
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.400
you want some good.
It's just like eating at home.
It's way cheaper.

303
00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.130
Pull your fucking money together.

304
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.300
All he is and how many attacks.

305
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.560
Don't get yourself just a fucking bottle of Johnnie Walker blue.
Just get that.

306
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.960
You know what I mean?
Don't put any ice on it.

307
00:18:11.961 --> 00:18:16.400
You can't sip it like a fucking gentleman telling you.

308
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.610
I don't know that.
You know who the Yuki can appreciate that in your 20s,

309
00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:23.090
if you appreciate that in your 20s,
uh,
you're,
you're,

310
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:26.630
you're a fucking raging alcoholic.
If your palate is that sophisticated,

311
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.840
either that or you have dad's a banker,
Assam Shit,
you know,

312
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.680
instead of you finishing his morning coffee with some sort of booze so we can

313
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:36.530
numb the fucking lies he was going to tell all day out.
Jesus,
Bill,

314
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:39.260
could you get more dramatic?
I'm sorry.
What?
What do you want from me?

315
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.160
We Times I've got to tell you guys,
I've got an hour to fucking fill here.

316
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.180
I would have fucking fill over there.
Um,
all right,

317
00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:49.370
let's get to some of the reads for this week.
Hey everybody,

318
00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:54.020
you're going to get the listen to me.
Read out loud.
Um,
by the way,
um,

319
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.750
no,
no,
uh,
no hard feelings with a,

320
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.410
a draft kings by the way.
They explained that position to me.
They,

321
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.880
they know that the gambling,
they don't give a fuck,
right?

322
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.940
But they're just a business with baseball.
They're trying to make their money.

323
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.300
Why would I be a Douche and try to part them for making money?
Right.

324
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.260
So they said eventually they'll come back to the podcast and I'll play ball.

325
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.210
All right,
I'll play ball.
What do you want from me?
You know,

326
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.410
I immediately,
it was probably because I never talked to the advertisers.

327
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.350
That helps,
you know whenever they call it the complaint.
Is he available?
No.

328
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.630
When is he available?
Never.

329
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:38.070
I already know what you're gonna say.
Ooh.
Like what you said.
All right,
darling.

330
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:42.510
Shave club everybody.
For only a dollar you can get a great shave.

331
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.910
Alrighty.
I've got to tell you.
Shaving the old way sucks a lot.
It hurts.

332
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:52.620
You lather up with cheap foam wincing.
His hair is scraped from your face.

333
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:57.180
With those old worn out razors,
you won't throw away.
Why?

334
00:19:57.181 --> 00:20:00.360
Because they cost so God damn much.
Well,
not anymore.

335
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:04.710
Everybody Dollar Shave Club sends amazing razors for a few bucks and when you

336
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:09.711
use them with their members only what the jacket with their members only owe Dr

337
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:13.200
Covey's EEZ shea.

338
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.270
Okay.
Completely changed.
It changes the game.
Forget foam.

339
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.490
The foam face.
This stuff is the real deal.
It's magic.

340
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.630
Something happens when you put it on.
It's hard to describe it,

341
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.480
but it feels amazing.
It's the most gentle,
peaceful shave imaginable.

342
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.540
It's just starting to make me think about Hitler with that Easel.

343
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.410
Painting the ducks.
You barely know your shaving.

344
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.770
Never a good thing to bring up.
Hitler in the middle of it.

345
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.730
Add other shaving products can leave your face feeling dry and tight.
It's awful.

346
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
But Dr Covey's easy shave fucking butter is high quality stuff.

347
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.310
Just like their razors.
It's got organic.

348
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:05.240
All natural ingredients like pear cactus and black willow bark.
Ah,

349
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.260
so you know,
it's good.
So your skin feels fresh,

350
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:10.420
smooth and moisturized after a shape.

351
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:14.620
How the fuck does bark make your face smooth?
It's gotta be the shit in it,
right?

352
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.910
They wring it out.
You know there's grip strength for you,
Huh?

353
00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.810
Wringing out some fucking tree bark.
It's great to,
if you have sensitive skin,

354
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.130
Dr Carver's easy shave butter from dollar shave club is like nothing.

355
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:29.720
You've tried Dr Carver's.
Easy shave bothered.

356
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.750

Hitler.
That's the first one.

371
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:31.630
He took two for two on the advertising with the old Hitler reference resulting

372
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:36.631
in a fabric that is two times softer than cotton and now my podcast,

<v 3>Okay.</v>

384
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.320
<v 0>Hey,
you like making great money,
right?
You don't,</v>

385
00:23:16.321 --> 00:23:18.840
well then don't listen to the rest of this,
but if you like making money,

386
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.810
do you want to get out there?
Here's a real cool opportunity that,
uh,

387
00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.740
Uber had to share with you driving with Uber.

388
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.410
Uber's that popular smart phone app that connects riders with drivers.
Okay?

389
00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:35.820
If you take Uber a bunch,
why don't you become an Uber driver if you love them?

390
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.660
If you like chatting with the different drivers,
you know,

391
00:23:39.661 --> 00:23:44.510
and listening to their interesting stories,
you could be one of them,
you know?

392
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.090
Do you ever notice those Uber drivers,
they

393
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:50.200
<v 4>love being their own bosses.
They are great money and it's easy to start.</v>

394
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.270
All you need is a car and a license.

395
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.770
Driving with Uber is great for anyone who needs flexibility.
Parents,

396
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.260
there's this,
uh,
this is a really great,

397
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.650
really easy way to work around your family schedule.

398
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.030
It's a great way to avoid your family.
You know what I mean?

399
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.390
It's a great way to do a whole bunch of things.
You know what?

400
00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:12.790
That's a great job for a hitman.
I'm going to go make some extra money,
honey.

401
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.730
See you later.
Go Up.
You know,
you pick a couple of fairs,

402
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.420
you go make your hit and then you come back,
right?
It's all kind of,

403
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.870
the opportunities are endless.
With Uber Students,

404
00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:26.840
you can make extra money between classes.
No more strip in lay.

405
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.940
Now's the prime time to cash in with Uber.

406
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.720
You'll thank me for telling you how to get paid every week.
All right,

407
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.940
call to action.
All right,
here's the series part.

408
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:41.070
You got a car and a license put on bolts to work your scumbag.

409
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.520
Why you a scumbag?
Put 'em both foot cause I was talking like that.
Slow down.

410
00:24:45.521 --> 00:24:49.600
Don't put them both for work for you and start earning serious life.

411
00:24:49.601 --> 00:24:53.050
Changing money.
Sign up to Uber.

Drive with uber.com.

414
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.050
I was like,
I won the first three quarters and I fucked it up in the end.
Christ,

415
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.100
you're lost the game.
Um,

416
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.420
anyway,
so let's,
uh,
let's move on with the podcast here.

417
00:25:13.421 --> 00:25:15.220
A lot of shit happened in the news.

418
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.640
The latest person to get in trouble and to be branded a racist mania.

419
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.680
How Cogan it's running wild.
Um,
the holster,

420
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.130
having a conversation,
dropping the n word,
dropping the fucking end.

421
00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.180
So then his brought his,
his uh,
his daughter comes to his defense,

422
00:25:34.181 --> 00:25:37.930
says he's not a racist.
You know,
I don't know who the fuck,

423
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.000
what are you going to do?
I mean,
you're dropping the n word that,

424
00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:42.100
that's a rough one.
I'll tell you,
that's a rough one.
You know,

425
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.410
then he's got friends who are African kid in America yet he's fucking dropping

426
00:25:47.411 --> 00:25:49.240
the n word.
You know what I think it really is.

427
00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:53.380
I think there's a bunch of different levels to being racist.

428
00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:58.570
You know what I mean?
It's like me,
I play drums,
but it's just a fucking hobby.

429
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.500
John Bonham was a fucking drum,
you know what I mean?

430
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.870
So like the John Bonham's of,
of,

431
00:26:04.871 --> 00:26:09.871
of racism are like in the clan there in like those white supremacy groups,

432
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:11.223
you know,

433
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.390
<v 0>they were in the,
the fucking Dwayne,
it will be with the Nazis.</v>

434
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:20.490
You know what I mean?
They are professional fucking racist.
This is what they do.

435
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.140
This is how they are to living.
You know,
can you earn a living in the claim?

436
00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.230
Is it a kind of like a volunteer fire department,
but you,

437
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.570
but you're just fucking,

438
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.130
you're racist and you start fires would,

439
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.000
it's like a drum circle except you just say hateful shit.

440
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:39.490
<v 4>Okay,</v>

441
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.630
<v 0>what exactly is the client?
Why would you join Klan?</v>

442
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.900
And then he got other people who are more like,
you know,

443
00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.150
it's like they're not a professional racist,
but if they wanted to be,

444
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:57.190
they wanted to be,
they could be the grand dragon in the clan.

445
00:26:57.191 --> 00:26:58.630
They just don't apply themselves.

446
00:26:58.631 --> 00:27:02.140
So instead they work at like home depot or some shit.
Right.

447
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.240
They think just as much fucked up shit.

448
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.360
And then he got the person who occasionally,
you know,

449
00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.360
like me goes around plays drums every once in a while.

450
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.720
These guys do the same thing except they drop the n word every once in a while.

451
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.260
I think Hogan is like right around there,
you know what I mean?

452
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.500
Just like when his daughters saying he's not a racist,

453
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:26.050
she means like he's not in the clan,
he doesn't have a swastika tattoo.

454
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.650
You know what I mean?
But he's still playing drums there.

455
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.070
You know what I'm saying?
Why am I relating drums to fucking be in rice?

456
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.890
I don't fucking know.
Who knows?
He was also,
I looked up his age.

457
00:27:35.891 --> 00:27:40.330
He's 61 years old.
He was born August 11th,

458
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:44.350
1953 so that means if his parents,
Adam,
it like what?

459
00:27:44.351 --> 00:27:45.820
Like 25

460
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.330
they were born in 1928 so Jesus Christ,

461
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:54.480
I mean what the fuck we are his parents filling his heads head up with,
right.

462
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.390
His parents lived through the depression.

463
00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.610
They was already preaching that there wasn't enough and that black people,

464
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:05.520
now that they were free,
we're going to take everything from the white man.

465
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:07.230
That paranoia was probably already there.

466
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:09.180
Then they went into the fucking depression.

467
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.930
So maybe his parents were extra fucking racist.

468
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.700
So we had to crawl out of that hole and him crawling out of that hole was having

469
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:21.330
black friends.
But Eh,
but you know,
he's like one of those,
he has black friends,

470
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:24.330
but he's like,
I don't want my daughter to date one.

471
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.960
So he's like,
you know,
I tell you,

472
00:28:29.961 --> 00:28:31.380
he was like an intermediate racist.

473
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.050
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't know what to tell your brother.
Um,

474
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.680
what are you going to do?
Who's getting,
no,
you know you're fucking,

475
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:46.300
you put a tape recorder on and people still don't know the song.

476
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.300
Who knows what the fuck and,

477
00:28:47.301 --> 00:28:50.790
but we would all have to apologize for something if somebody left a fucking tape

478
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:55.770
recorder on all God Damn Day long and you didn't know was on Nixon lost the

479
00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:00.400
White House doing that shit.
You wouldn't be in trouble.
Jesus Christ,

480
00:29:00.401 --> 00:29:03.010
the fucking Shit that I say over the course of a day of,

481
00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:07.750
of fucking broads and all this tie that something,
something would come out,

482
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:08.861
you know,

483
00:29:08.861 --> 00:29:11.710
have they read all the texts that you do joking around with your friends,

484
00:29:11.711 --> 00:29:13.660
but you know,
it's a fucking joke.
You know what I mean?

485
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.200
Am I say you drop the n word but come on,
somebody would get you,

486
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.260
somebody get you for something homophobic,
right.

487
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.920
Something I don't fucking know.
But uh,

488
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.930
<v 2>okay.</v>

489
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.780
<v 0>I think it's,
it's going to be a good thing.
I think the guy,</v>

490
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:32.200
hopefully we'll learn something from it and he won't do shit like that anymore.

491
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.970
Hopefully you'll know that it's wrong.
But I really think in moments like that,

492
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.340
you gotta let somebody be a fucking human being.

493
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.290
You got to take into consideration when they were born,

494
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:46.210
what was fed into their fucking heads and give them an opportunity to redeem

495
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:47.850
themselves.
Cause if you just fuck each,

496
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.370
cancel all his fucking matches and all that,
what is that going to do?

497
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.000
Except drive them more towards anger?
That's what I say.

498
00:29:56.001 --> 00:29:58.690
Cause the other shit's not working.
Firing people.
You know what I mean?

499
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.380
That fucking chef there that had the slave theme fucking wedding.
Do you,

500
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:05.530
do you think she's not thinking,
you know,
I'm sure she's a little bit better,

501
00:30:05.531 --> 00:30:10.170
but did that really help?
I don't fucking know.

502
00:30:10.171 --> 00:30:14.630
What am I talking about?
Who knows?
So,
uh,
let's get back to the podcast.
So I,

503
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.510
oh,
he all,
this is what I wanted to talk about.
Here we go.
Here we go.

504
00:30:18.511 --> 00:30:23.511
So Tom Bray slaying all the ladies.

505
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.280
Um,
he's,
you know,

506
00:30:26.281 --> 00:30:31.281
he appealed the four game suspension and I'm somebody who is speaking for all

507
00:30:32.311 --> 00:30:33.720
the owners said that they were,

508
00:30:33.721 --> 00:30:36.660
they were all hoping that they would all the other arms.
I should say,

509
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.740
we're hoping that uh,

510
00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.060
the NFL would uphold this suspension

511
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.970
because what he did was so fucking horrific or allegedly did,
you know,

512
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:50.340
they can't fucking prove it or whatever.
That's the thing.

513
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.590
They can't fucking prove he did anything yet.

514
00:30:52.591 --> 00:30:56.400
There's a four game fucking suspension that these cops want to be upheld that

515
00:30:56.401 --> 00:31:01.401
they want to have upheld and the number one and two people fucking that are on

516
00:31:02.041 --> 00:31:04.110
their side,
believe it or not,

517
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:08.430
are the Indianapolis Colts and the fucking Baltimore Ravens.

518
00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:13.440
And this is such a fucking lay up for a joke.
The Ravens fucking quote,

519
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.850
let me find it here.

520
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

521
00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:20.100
<v 0>Was that the Patriots have been getting away with murder for years.</v>

522
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.960
Why?
If you're connected with the Baltimore Ravens,

523
00:31:24.961 --> 00:31:28.470
would you ever use the expression getting away with murder?

524
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.900
These fucking teams,
you know,

525
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.350
they're all sitting in glass houses and I love that they fucking trash the

526
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:38.370
Patriots for whatever the fuck it is.
They think that we're doing.
You know,

527
00:31:38.371 --> 00:31:40.260
like they're these holier than thou people.

528
00:31:40.261 --> 00:31:43.110
You want to talk about getting away with murder.
Hey,
how about this?

529
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.350
At least when one of our players is involved in a murder,

530
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:51.510
the fucker goes to jail,
you know at least we got that on you,

531
00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:57.270
the fucking ravens.
Jesus Christ and your last fucking decade.

532
00:31:57.271 --> 00:31:58.560
Yeah,
the guy fucking

533
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:06.100
fucking drop his fiance and an elevator and drag her out.

534
00:32:06.561 --> 00:32:10.820
And you guys were fine with the four game suspension cause all you give a fuck

535
00:32:10.821 --> 00:32:14.570
about is the performance and then you add on to your other guy there,
right.

536
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:15.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

537
00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.540
<v 0>Obstruction of justice in a double fucking homicide.</v>

538
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.520
Not only do you look the other fucking way,
you let him play in the Superbowl,

539
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.600
he invites his two buddies there who are up on the fucking double homicide

540
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:31.780
charges are sitting there in the game and you didn't give a fuck and you're

541
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:32.614
going to talk about,

542
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.230
<v 3>okay,</v>

543
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.100
<v 0>shame on you.</v>

544
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.860
Shame on you Baltimore Ravens and know you have to get involved with the

545
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:44.030
Indianapolis Colts.

546
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:49.090
Every game that Andrew luck starts is cheating for the Indianapolis Colts.

547
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:54.590
Considering how they got him and they tanked and entire fucking season.

548
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.130
And if you don't think that they did that,
then you still believe in Santa Claus.

549
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.940
All right?
I'm not even saying my team is fucking it.
Innocent.

550
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.730
Not by any stretch of the fucking means.

551
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.300
I don't give a fuck if you say my team cheats,

552
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:11.660
but it's when you get on your high horse and you say that your team doesn't

553
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:14.240
cheat too.
That's when I say,
Hey,
you know what?

554
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.740
I think I'm going to walk away from this and I'm going to go have myself a water

555
00:33:18.741 --> 00:33:22.910
with the lemon because I'm on the wagon.
Yeah.

556
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.290
One of the fucking ravens in the cults just own up to the fact that you're just

557
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:33.630
jealous of how long the patriots have been good and how many fucking Superbowls

558
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.520
we've been to when,
how many gains we fucking won.
All right.
You cuts,

559
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.070
you got yourself two super bowls.
The Ravens.
What's your fucking problem?

560
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.940
Indianapolis.
I know what that guy's fucking problem is.

561
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:51.440
It's his goddamn personal life.
Um,
oh Geez.
Oh,
I was a low blow.

562
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.030
I did not want to say that.
I didn't want to say that,

563
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:55.760
but I'm just sick of this guy trying to fucking,
you know,
of course,

564
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:57.440
these constant want Brady to come back.

565
00:33:57.441 --> 00:33:59.080
They want the Patriots to be Oh and forced.

566
00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:02.510
So they got a fucking chance at winning a better fucking chance right now.

567
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.360
Do you think they're really outraged at the Patriots?
They're not.

568
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.670
This is just part of them.
The same way,

569
00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:11.210
like you fucking tank a season to get Andrew luck the same way you look the

570
00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:13.610
other way and obstruction of justice or a fucking,
you know,

571
00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:16.550
somebody's beating the shit out of somebody in an elevator because you want

572
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:19.340
those players on the fucking field.
You don't want Brady on the field.

573
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:21.290
So of course you're going to play the outrage card.

574
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.860
Of course you're going to do that when someone else almost beat the fucking

575
00:34:24.861 --> 00:34:27.350
girlfriend to death and almost got fucking four games.

576
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:31.240
Not Talking about the guy from Baltimore,
this latest fucking guy.
All right?

577
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.880
It's complete fucking horseshit.

578
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.080
So anybody out there who's actually buying into this shit,
yeah,

579
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.960
you're just a Patriot hater,
or you believe in Santa Claus.
All right.

580
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:44.450
And I'm never going to hear your argument because I don't go to sports bars.

581
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.260
I think people who actually really think that this is a big deal,

582
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.830
the whole fucking deflate gate thing or the kind of people that even in July are

583
00:34:55.161 --> 00:35:00.161
sitting there wearing a pro level Nfl Jersey with somebody else's name on the

584
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:06.080
back and you got wing sauce and you in your fucking beard stubble.

585
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.620
All right?
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

586
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.010
I think it's high time you fucking grow up.
What do you think about that?

587
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.400
I don't give a fuck if Brady comes back in game six.

588
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:19.460
We're still gonna make the playoffs and we still going to come back and fucking

589
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:21.560
hunt.
You counts.
Right?

590
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.470
And we're going to break your hearts and your own fucking stadium.

591
00:35:24.471 --> 00:35:27.040
I don't care how loud you are.
All right.

592
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.400
Well if you go there dressed like a bird,
you know,
oh,

593
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:35.150
you got a sword in your tooth a year.
Fucking eat a dog bone.

594
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.800
They don't give a fuck they're,

595
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.930
they're going to come in there and metaphorically speaking,

596
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.840
they're going to gut you.
All right.
So get ready for the heartache.

597
00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:48.730
Another football season's coming.
Oh,
talking to a bunch of shit.

598
00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.230
I don't give a fuck.
We just want a fourth.
I'm a happy thin.
Um,
speaking of which,

599
00:35:53.231 --> 00:35:58.090
being up in Montreal,
um,
always makes me think of the expos.
And,

600
00:35:58.091 --> 00:36:01.330
uh,
I would tell you that time I went to an expose game by myself.

601
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.640
I was doing a Gig.

602
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:04.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

603
00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.860
<v 0>I might've done it.
It was either a college or I did the Lake Ontario playhouse.</v>

604
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.580
Um,
way back in the day.
Um,

605
00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:17.660
that's like one of the first headlining lining gigs I got outside of the New

606
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.340
England area.
And uh,
Mike Kenny I believe was the guy who booked me up there,

607
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.730
had a great,
I always love doing that Gig.
But anyways,
um,

608
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:30.790
so I was up there up on Lake Ontario and it was at that point I was trying to go

609
00:36:31.041 --> 00:36:34.250
to all the ballparks.
So I saw that the expos

610
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.310
had a game the next day.
So I said,
fuck it.

611
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:43.311
So I got in my rental car by myself and I'm crossing the Canadian border in a

612
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:45.390
very obscure place.

613
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:49.620
I'm not coming up 95 and I'm by myself.

614
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.630
So the fucking security guard up there,
you know,
security guard,

615
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.690
you go into another country tunchy five the security guard cause walking up,

616
00:36:57.691 --> 00:37:02.190
he's like a,
he's like,
oh well you're going there.
Hey.
And I was sorry.

617
00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:07.110
And I was like,
I'm going to weigh a nexspos gang.
He's like,
Oh yeah,

618
00:37:07.111 --> 00:37:12.000
you're going up there by yourself.
And I was like,
Yep.
And he goes,

619
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:13.830
okay,
why don't you pull over there?
Hey.

620
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.860
So I pull over my rental car and I'm like,
what the fuck?

621
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:18.150
I never got pulled over before.

622
00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:22.740
And I'm standing there and him and this other guy proceeded to rip my fucking

623
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:26.520
rental car part.
I'm like,
what are they doing?
And then it finally dawned on me

624
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.250
how put that,
they thought

625
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:36.630
that nobody was pathetic enough to drive an extra two and a half hours to go see

626
00:37:38.741 --> 00:37:41.140
an afternoon expos game by themselves.

627
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.200
Nobody was that sad of a human being.

628
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:49.330
And it just struck me as funny and I started fucking laughing and they will

629
00:37:49.331 --> 00:37:52.780
looking over at me and I had this big smile on my face and I was laughing cause

630
00:37:52.781 --> 00:37:55.090
I knew they thought this guy has got gotta be dealing drugs,

631
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.720
there's no way he's actually going to an expo as gay by himself.
And um,

632
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.920
it pissed them off and they searched even harder.

633
00:38:02.921 --> 00:38:06.120
And then when did they just realized I was just laughing at them?
Uh,

634
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.980
I think they took extra time almost trying to make me lose the game,

635
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:10.240
losing I miss the game.

636
00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:14.650
So I end up getting the car and I drove up there and I sat out in the outfield

637
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.030
at Olympic Stadium and I remember they had one arm rest on the chairs out there

638
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.680
and for whatever fucking reason,
bare bones,
it's an Olympic fucking stadium.

639
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:28.690
It's the one that I believe Bruce Jenner,
who's now Katie,
Caitlin,
right?

640
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:33.580
He fucking won the,
uh,
the goddamn decathlon there.
And,
uh,

641
00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:37.780
I sat out there and I watched somebody home plate and I jumped up and he fucking

642
00:38:37.781 --> 00:38:40.330
air freaking out that I saw somebody steal home plate.

643
00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:41.170
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

644
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.500
<v 0>Um,
then nobody in the stadium was reacting.</v>

645
00:38:44.501 --> 00:38:47.380
So I sat back down thinking I didn't see what I just saw.

646
00:38:47.381 --> 00:38:52.300
And then I went home and I watched TSN or whatever.
Fuck I watched that night.

647
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.430
Uh,
that's their ESPN up there.
And they go,
I have up,
you don't see it.

648
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.283
I love that.

649
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:57.550
<v 3>Okay.</v>

650
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.910
<v 0>And I realized that I had actually seen it and was fucked out of the moment</v>

651
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:04.390
because the people out in the outfield with too busy singing that soccer song,

652
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:09.080
that Olay or Layla Layla Bullshit.
Um,
my Montreal story.
So anyways,

653
00:39:09.081 --> 00:39:09.914
uh,

654
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:15.110
which always reminds me whenever I think of the Expos is,
uh,

655
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.110
that fucking team that could have been,

656
00:39:18.111 --> 00:39:21.710
which was the 1994 Montreal Expos,

657
00:39:21.711 --> 00:39:25.430
the one that Pedro Martinez always gets that look in his eye when he talks about

658
00:39:25.431 --> 00:39:28.040
going,
aw man,
we will load it.
We will load it.

659
00:39:28.041 --> 00:39:30.200
They were like the best team in baseball.

660
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:34.070
And then the strike came canceled the rest of the season and the world series.

661
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.520
And I always thought that Pedro Martinez was on that team with Randy Johnson.

662
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.850
And I believe I've said that on the podcast.

663
00:39:43.851 --> 00:39:47.720
And no one to my knowledge has ever corrected me.
Um,

664
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.690
he wasn't Randy Johnson,
um,
Pedro Martinez was,

665
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.910
was,
was part of one of the worst trades of all fucking time.

666
00:39:55.911 --> 00:40:00.911
The Dodgers thought he was too brittle to small to last and they traded him to

667
00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:04.220
Montreal for fucking Jack Squat.

668
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:09.510
And um,
so that,
that trade is always brought up.

669
00:40:09.511 --> 00:40:14.511
But the Randy Johnson trade the expos trade to Seattle whenever they do like

670
00:40:14.731 --> 00:40:19.110
that,
some,
you know,
the top 20 worst major league fucking trades of all time,

671
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.590
it's never in there.
So here's one for you.

672
00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:24.660
Here's an obscure one cause people always bring up,
you know,

673
00:40:24.661 --> 00:40:28.470
obviously the biggest one of all time is the Red Sox,
you know,

674
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.250
selling Babe Ruth,
you know,

675
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.970
we traded the guy for cash so this guy could fucking

676
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:39.790
good bankroll his wife's Broadway play.

677
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.680
Unfucking believable.
Unfucking believable,

678
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:49.000
even unforgivable back then because who knew what it was going to become?

679
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:52.480
Baseball and everything,
but just fuck it.
That that is the worst one of all time.

680
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.510
But he is one that it is and this fascinates me.

681
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.320
Worst trades of all time that nobody brings that nobody really brings up.

682
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.250
If you guys like to tweet me some,
I'll read,
read some on Thursday.
Um,

683
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.680
or if you want to email me,
I'll,
I'll get the thing here.
What is it?
Uh,

684
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:13.770
the email is the fuck is it bill@themmpodcast.com.

685
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:20.290
bill@themmpodcast.com.
So Expos traded Randy Johnson,

686
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:25.660
he played for them in 1988 and looked promising.

687
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:31.290
And then he started off 1989 really poorly.
He went,

688
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.060
he started off all in for,

689
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.130
and his era was a little bit high and they just,
I don't know,

690
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:39.650
they must've thought he was a flash in the pan.
So listen to this.

691
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.650
When the Marin is traded in,
Marin is traded.
Oh,
let let,

692
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.780
I should say the expos traded Randy Johnson to the mariners for Mark Langston

693
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:53.620
and Mike Campbell.
All right.

694
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.890
And the Seattle got Randy Johnson and then Jean Harris.
Brian Hollman.

695
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.180
Uh,

696
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.060
I believe that that was the trade and virtually all these Seattle players were

697
00:42:04.061 --> 00:42:08.260
unhappy.
Here's some of the homes here,
some of the quotes,
third Baseman,

698
00:42:08.261 --> 00:42:11.790
Jim Presley said.
So this is actually,
I guess exonerates them the,

699
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:16.420
the expos because if a other pro baseball players will like what the fuck did we

700
00:42:16.421 --> 00:42:18.550
do?
I guess it's not that bad,
but third baseman,

701
00:42:18.551 --> 00:42:23.110
Jim Presley said this is a sad day for Marin,
a baseball in four months.

702
00:42:23.111 --> 00:42:26.600
Now we've lost two of the best pitchers in Marin has history.
Uh,

703
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.220
cause they just trade Langston and Mike Moore who signed with Oakland and the

704
00:42:30.221 --> 00:42:33.460
other side is a free agent and he's going,
yeah,
this is a sad day.

705
00:42:33.461 --> 00:42:37.390
I don't know what went on whether they made him an offer or to him or whether he

706
00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:38.171
wanted Outta here,

707
00:42:38.171 --> 00:42:41.410
but maybe they should have been thinking of how we're supposed to replace them.

708
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:46.870
Second Basement,
Harold Reynolds,
Harold Reynolds,

709
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.240
who's one of my favorite baseball people of all time.
He just knows so much.

710
00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.760
He,
this is him as a young man,

711
00:42:54.761 --> 00:42:59.740
said this crushes me and the reality of it all won't hit me until we take the

712
00:42:59.741 --> 00:43:03.870
field tomorrow in Milwaukee.
And Mike Langston won't be there.
Uh,

713
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.280
in defense of him,
that kind of seems like he was buddies with them,

714
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:11.350
but a catcher day valley just said,
oh no.
Oh No.

715
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:18.510
Which brings me now to my own Boston Bruins and we had made some very,

716
00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:27.210
to put it mildly aggressive fucking moves here in the off season.

717
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:33.100
Um,
we obviously traded Milan Lou Cheech to the Cha,

718
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:38.190
the Kings in exchange in exchange for the 13th overall pick and backup

719
00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:43.390
goaltender Martin Jones and defenseman prospect call and Miller.

720
00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:48.730
Now I really hope in the future as I read these names that the,
some,

721
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.570
some somebody pan the fuck out.
I'm so here.
Okay.

722
00:43:52.571 --> 00:43:55.150
With the flurry of trades and draft picks,
Bruins,
GM,

723
00:43:55.151 --> 00:43:59.350
dawn Sweeney began a roster makeover.
He really did.

724
00:43:59.351 --> 00:44:01.690
So here's what we ended up getting.
We try.
We also traded,

725
00:44:01.691 --> 00:44:04.030
obviously we got rid of Doug Hamilton.
So here,

726
00:44:04.031 --> 00:44:08.290
here's what we got with our picks and I'm hoping someday in the future and the

727
00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:09.460
fucking future,

728
00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.170
somebody's going to listen to this and say that this was a great move because,

729
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.103
um,

730
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.040
<v 3>okay.</v>

731
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.850
<v 0>You know,
back in the day when we traded a,
what's his face?</v>

732
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:24.460
I always forget his fucking name.
The hell's his goddamn name.

733
00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:26.950
The guy that we traded,
it wouldn't go into the corners,

734
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:29.620
but he's Scholes scored all the goals.
We traded them to Toronto.

735
00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:34.380
The only guy I've seen in the NHL,
he,
he looks,
he has like a pickup hockey face.

736
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.110
He looks like he's accountant during the week.
You know what I mean?

737
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:39.900
He's the only guy I've seen with a fat face.
How are you fat playing hockey?

738
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.230
That's one thing I tell you.
There's no fat fucking hockey players.

739
00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:45.040
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

740
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.020
<v 0>Not none whatsoever,
but somehow this guy is fucking fat.
Jesus Christ.</v>

741
00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:54.070
Hang on a second.
What the fuck is this?
God damn name.
Let me look this up here.

742
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.130
Douggie Hamilton,

743
00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.900
Hamilton fucking tray.
There we go.
There we go.
Bruins hurt themselves.

744
00:45:05.901 --> 00:45:10.850
Bruins Trade Douggie Hamilton for draft picks to the fucking fives.
Jesus Christ,

745
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:15.050
whatever.
So anyways,
what is the guy's name?
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:18.800
Everybody right now is fill castle.
All right,

747
00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:22.490
so back in the day we trade Phil Kessel to the Toronto Maple leafs in 2009 for a

748
00:45:22.491 --> 00:45:26.750
pair of first round draft picks that later we'd later use to select Tyler Sagan

749
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.030
and Douggie Hamilton.
And it was expected,

750
00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.750
coined this article that those two players would be cornerstones of the

751
00:45:32.751 --> 00:45:35.570
organization,
at least for the next decade.
And by the way,

752
00:45:35.571 --> 00:45:37.880
we ended up winning the Stanley Cup with those two guys.

753
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.510
So now we're doing it again.
We're trading again.

754
00:45:41.511 --> 00:45:45.140
We're kinda like the mini Blackhawks.
We don't win as many.
We've only made,

755
00:45:45.141 --> 00:45:48.800
we've made big fucking moves,
but we've only won one.
So I'm,

756
00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:53.801
I'm actually willing to give Sweeney the benefit of the doubt.

757
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:59.150
What goes,
who's getting,
no,
this is all I fucking got.
What else am I going to do?

758
00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.780
Um,
so here's,
here's all the draft picks that we got.

759
00:46:02.781 --> 00:46:07.180
First round draft pick number 13,
the Boston Bruins,
select defensemen.

760
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.110
I can't even say the guy's name.

761
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:14.960
Jacob's a board is a Boral 18 was third among rookie defenseman Quebec.

762
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:21.080
I don't give a fuck how big he is.
He 13 goals.
20th assists last season.

763
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:26.000
Then we picked this kid number 14 we had backed it back,
picks.

764
00:46:26.001 --> 00:46:30.950
We picked a fucking sniper.
Jake Debraski,

765
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:34.490
18 six feet tall,
174 pounds.

766
00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:38.960
Jesus Christ,
I'd love to be 174 puffs.
Sorry.

767
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:42.890
Forward led the Western hockey league.
Swift League.

768
00:46:42.891 --> 00:46:46.430
Swift current in scoring with 42 goals in 39 assists.

769
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.420
Nice and even spreading it around.
Stick it in the back of the fucking net.

770
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.760
Number 15 we selected.

771
00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:57.820
This is the guy I like just just as far as side Zachary Senni Shin.

772
00:46:57.861 --> 00:46:59.110
I don't want to say it's fucking names.

773
00:46:59.111 --> 00:47:04.111
[inaudible] 18th spent last season a Blahblahblahblahblah.

774
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.590
When I,
wait a minute,
where's the fucking,

775
00:47:06.591 --> 00:47:10.400
there's somebody here is like six five Harry is,

776
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:14.420
this is a guy I got hope for.
Number 37 defensemen.

777
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:19.630
Brandon Carlo 18 the six 596 found nine at 996 pound defenseman had four goals.

778
00:47:21.951 --> 00:47:26.000
21 assists.
Sounds like he's a stay at home guy,
you know,

779
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:30.580
I don't know.
I'm hoping somebody pans out.
That's what we got.

780
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.940
So I'm actually kind of excited now.
We're really young.

781
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.820
Fuck it.
Sweeney cleaned house.
What am I going to do?
Be that guy.
Oh Bitch.

782
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:40.720
Moans and complains.

783
00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:44.500
So hopefully some of those means somebody something to somebody some day.
Right.

784
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:48.250
And you guys can actually laugh that I mispronounced all of the fucking names.

785
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:53.240
You know,
hopefully I just mispronounced the next fucking Wayne Gretzky.

786
00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:55.043
Um,

787
00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:56.220
<v 3>yeah.</v>

788
00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:57.540
<v 0>But anyways,
it's going to be hard.</v>

789
00:47:57.541 --> 00:48:01.170
It's going to be hard seeing that fucking no Lou cheats.
No.
Douggie Hamilton.

790
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.970
Doug Hamilton was in the prime is fucking career.

791
00:48:02.971 --> 00:48:06.090
I still think that was a fucking crazy move.
Why do you do that?

792
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.900
Sky's a proven guy.
Well,
you know,

793
00:48:08.901 --> 00:48:11.600
he's probably going to want a lot of money while he fucking deserves it.
Pay Him.

794
00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.760
All right,
I'm done.
I'm done with that shit.

795
00:48:14.761 --> 00:48:16.410
Let's get back to the fucking podcast here.

796
00:48:16.411 --> 00:48:21.330
Let's get to some of the questions here.
All right.
Uh,
okay.
Romanian fan.

797
00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:26.190
Funny you should say that.
Ashley was actually talking to my agent today about,

798
00:48:26.191 --> 00:48:29.400
uh,
doing an eastern European tour.

799
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.450
I was thinking of doing two European tours next year where I do the,
uh,

800
00:48:33.451 --> 00:48:36.510
the usual guys,
Iceland over to England.

801
00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.890
And then next and then later I do fucking Scandinavia and then down the fucking

802
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:45.660
a Baltic states there.
Um,
hi bill.
My name is Eddie.

803
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.670
I'm a 30 year old Romanian living in the UK.

804
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:54.460
I'm six one and used to be 290 pounds and in January decided to become serious

805
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:59.970
and lose weight.
Uh,
I got to a lowest of two 17,

806
00:48:59.971 --> 00:49:03.300
but two months ago I started working as a truck driver and I'm starting to gain

807
00:49:03.301 --> 00:49:06.900
the weight back.
I used a,
I used to work in a warehouse,

808
00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:10.080
very physical job and also quit smoking four months ago.

809
00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.110
I listened to your podcast.
I'm a big fan.
Uh,

810
00:49:13.111 --> 00:49:18.090
you are a great comedian and I only wrote to you because I absolutely love your

811
00:49:18.091 --> 00:49:20.160
way and share all your political views.

812
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.000
Please put some punctuation in this.

813
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:27.900
I know you mentioned my country a few podcasts ago when you were in Paris and

814
00:49:27.901 --> 00:49:30.690
your lovely wife,
who am I salute kindly.

815
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:35.430
I love people learning English.
It's so proper.
I salute kindly.

816
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:40.170
Why salute you to kindly and I want you to know that we Romanians are damned to

817
00:49:40.171 --> 00:49:44.850
be born in the same country with those pests that are called Gypsies.

818
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.220
They ruined our name and country,

819
00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:52.050
but I 100% agree with the fact that you did a heads up for your future holiday

820
00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:54.720
makers in Paris.
And second of all,

821
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.590
I'm a trucker and a few podcasts ago you were wondering if truckers are

822
00:49:58.591 --> 00:50:02.430
listening to you.
Uh,
well my good man,
at least one surely does.

823
00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.750
The point of the email is do I continue to do this job that I fucking love being

824
00:50:06.751 --> 00:50:08.960
a trucker but probably going to gone

825
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:11.790
fuck all my hard work,

826
00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:16.070
hard work of losing weight or do you have a piece of advice?

827
00:50:16.071 --> 00:50:21.000
Thank you so very much.
Yeah,
dude,
start eating healthy.
Starting healthy.

828
00:50:21.001 --> 00:50:23.250
What I would do is I would go to the grocery store,

829
00:50:23.251 --> 00:50:26.500
I'd have a fucking cooler and uh,

830
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:29.080
for breakfast have like an apple or an orange.

831
00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:34.540
I would make sure that I eat really light and at night I would try to get on the

832
00:50:34.541 --> 00:50:38.920
fucking treadmill,
but you have to eat perfectly.
And,
um,

833
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.040
you have to learn way more about nutrition than I do.

834
00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:44.870
But if you love being a truck,
a man just

835
00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:45.760
<v 3>okay,</v>

836
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.850
<v 0>you gotta you gotta have a job you love because then it doesn't feel like work.</v>

837
00:50:48.851 --> 00:50:51.640
But if you starting to put the weight on,
um,

838
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:52.660
<v 3>okay.</v>

839
00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:53.493
<v 0>You know,</v>

840
00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:57.370
I would definitely say don't eat after five and I would have a giant fucking

841
00:50:57.371 --> 00:51:02.050
salad with some protein every night for dinner.
Get yourself a sandwich.

842
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.370
I crushed the fucking waters,
you know?
Um,

843
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:07.390
late night snack,

844
00:51:07.391 --> 00:51:11.230
I do the salary with a spoonful of peanut butter and that gets me through.

845
00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:13.750
And I've never tried to be a trucker that is fucking brutal.

846
00:51:13.751 --> 00:51:18.430
The closest thing I've ever been to a trucker as far as is,
um,

847
00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.720
difficult to,
to,

848
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.020
to stay in shape was sitting in a writers room when I sat in the writer's room

849
00:51:23.021 --> 00:51:27.040
at f is for family.
I put on some weight then that went into the holidays,

850
00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:29.770
which went into the world tour,
not world tour.

851
00:51:29.771 --> 00:51:34.290
I want to see on the other side of the world.
And then,
uh,
you know,

852
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.960
these bus tours having fucking help.
So,
um,

853
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.480
<v 3>okay.</v>

854
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.040
<v 0>Oh,
and I would do is I just get on the scale,
see what your way,</v>

855
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:44.820
and then next week tried to just weight lighter.
That's it.

856
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.090
Even if it's just a pound because you can't fucking work out as much.

857
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.060
I would definitely try to be as active as you possibly can.

858
00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.120
You know what I would do?
I come up,
this is what I do.
If I was you,

859
00:51:54.121 --> 00:51:58.950
I'd come up with the fucking truck or workout and diet,
you know,
write a book,

860
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.750
figure out what works for you,

861
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.130
then turn it into a goddamn book and then they'll expand it.

862
00:52:05.131 --> 00:52:08.850
Not just the trucker diet.
Just say,
hey,
this worked for a guy driving a truck.

863
00:52:08.851 --> 00:52:11.640
Imagine what it would do for you.
All you do is commute.
They,

864
00:52:11.641 --> 00:52:15.030
they'd sell the shit out of it and then maybe you've got enough money to buy

865
00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:17.520
your own truck and start your own trucking company.
Who knows?

866
00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.560
I'll tell you right now,
you have a hit book.

867
00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:23.010
Even after they'd done stealing from you,
at least have time to go to the gym.

868
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:27.930
All right,
well,
thank you for listening.
And,
uh,
um,
I dunno,

869
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.710
I'll go to Romania someday with my pocket zips.

870
00:52:30.711 --> 00:52:33.630
Shut a girlfriend's parents.

871
00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.751
Hey Bill.

872
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:39.440
I am an eighth grade and I am about to date this girl who is a freshman in high

873
00:52:39.441 --> 00:52:42.920
school.
Dude,
you're fucking crushing it.
And unless you're a woman,
then hey,

874
00:52:42.921 --> 00:52:46.760
go easy.
Yes,

875
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:51.020
there is a double standard.
Your mother would say the same thing.
Uh,

876
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:54.650
the only problem is that our parents don't want her to date me because they

877
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:58.790
think she'll get bullied for dating a person in a lower grade from her.

878
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.050
Oh,
all right.
Okay.
That's interesting.
Uh,

879
00:53:02.051 --> 00:53:05.170
I definitely don't want to leave the relationship for some bullshit reasons.

880
00:53:05.171 --> 00:53:08.270
So I'm asking you and hopefully the lovely Nia to,
for your guys,

881
00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:12.170
advice on what I should do.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Wait,

882
00:53:12.171 --> 00:53:16.250
the only problem is her parents don't want her to date me.
Well,
I mean,

883
00:53:16.251 --> 00:53:19.250
you really don't have a choice here.
I mean,
you,
your only choices.

884
00:53:19.251 --> 00:53:22.550
I want to keep dating you.
[inaudible] this is the ball is in her court,

885
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.700
is not in her court.
So I would just say her,
say,
listen,

886
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.740
I really like you and I wanna uh,
I wanna be with you.

887
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:35.450
I'd like to date you.
Okay.
Um,
if you feel the same way,

888
00:53:35.451 --> 00:53:39.680
I'd hope you'd,
you'd want to keep dating me,
but,
uh,
I can't make you date me.

889
00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:45.110
So,
uh,
you know,
that's it.
I'm going all in world series of poker.

890
00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:48.230
I pushed all my chips in.
You still want to be with me.

891
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.140
I'll be down the fucking arcade tonight at eight o'clock.

892
00:53:51.141 --> 00:53:52.580
Whatever the kids do nowadays,

893
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:56.180
I'll be staring like a Zombie at my fucking playstation flatscreen and the

894
00:53:56.181 --> 00:54:00.450
surround sound.
Um,
I dunno.
What do you,

895
00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.230
I don't know what,
what,
what,
what?

896
00:54:03.231 --> 00:54:07.670
What more can you do other than tell her that you want to be with her?
You know,

897
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.390
that's what I would do,
but hey,
no matter what,

898
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:15.440
end on a good fucking note,
if she can't do it,

899
00:54:15.441 --> 00:54:20.120
just just to play this cart at your fucking age,
just be like,
you know what?

900
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:24.050
I understand he might even add this in there.
Listen,
I understand.

901
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.230
I don't want to put you in a bad position with your parents,

902
00:54:27.231 --> 00:54:30.800
but I do really like you and I would like to still be with you and that isn't

903
00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:31.634
bullshit,
right?

904
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.150
But the parent part is setting you up for the future because next year you're

905
00:54:35.151 --> 00:54:38.420
going to be a freshman,
provided you study and don't fuck up and be held back.

906
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:42.990
All right?
Don't be that guy with the mustache in eighth grade,
please.
All right?

907
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:47.420
And you get to fucking high school.
Now you were in high school.

908
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.020
You know,
it's not as bad.
Sophomore,
freshman who gives it,

909
00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.570
nobody's going to give a fuck.
You going to the same school.

910
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:58.310
You're laying the groundwork to still be in the ball game.

911
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.400
You know what I mean?
You're at bat right now.
The emergency swing right now.

912
00:55:01.401 --> 00:55:05.060
Stay alive.
Stay alive.
That's what I would say.

913
00:55:05.061 --> 00:55:07.040
Stay alive in the batter's box.
Just say,
listen,

914
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.210
I know it's gotta be tough that your parents are giving you a rough time.
Okay.

915
00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:13.370
And ultimately the decision's going to be yours,

916
00:55:13.371 --> 00:55:18.050
but I still want to date you because I really like you.
All right?
But,
uh,

917
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:22.450
I don't want to make you miserable either.
So make you know.
No,

918
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.470
goddammit.
I want one sentence too far to say.

919
00:55:24.471 --> 00:55:26.990
Make a decision that you're comfortable with.
I'll say that.

920
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:30.770
Say what the fuck I just said and leave off that last thing.
All right.

921
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:35.300
And then that's it.
And if she fucking lets you go,
like I say,

922
00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:39.530
stay on good fucking terms.
Uh,
with her.

923
00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:44.390
Do not stalk her on Facebook.
Do not pay attention.

924
00:55:44.391 --> 00:55:48.740
If she starts dating somebody else.
Listen,
if she decides to walk,
he just said,

925
00:55:48.741 --> 00:55:52.790
it'd be like,
all right,
well,
maybe next year when I'm in high school.
All right.

926
00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:59.310
Maybe then,
and she'll say,
yeah,
maybe then say,
all right.
And just say,
listen,

927
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:02.520
I'm not going to get mad if you start dating somebody else or something like

928
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:02.701
that.

929
00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:05.220
And then you fucking get it out there and then he can fucking crush it in eighth

930
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:09.240
grade.
You're in that dude.
You're right.
A Uri taken down.
I'm in ninth grade.

931
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:14.130
This is like,
you're going from majors down to fucking college ball,
you know,

932
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.230
hang in,
curve balls all day long,
sending them into the fucking trees.

933
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.160
Like the thrill ride.
I mean,

934
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:25.860
one of the first thrill ride fucking video I sent,
Ya know.
All right.

935
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:30.750
All right,
Bill.
I'm an old girlfriend.
My old girl,
I'm old girlfriend wants baby.

936
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:33.150
Uh,
hey Billy,

937
00:56:33.151 --> 00:56:37.140
I'm about to turn 48 and updating a great girl and she's just turned 34.

938
00:56:37.141 --> 00:56:40.590
Lucky me.
I was pretty loosey and married for 26 years and never had children.

939
00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:45.660
She has no baggage whatsoever.
No kids,
no x,
loser,
husband,
et Cetera.

940
00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:46.351
Uh,

941
00:56:46.351 --> 00:56:49.650
she said she would like to have at least one kid and I think she feels time is

942
00:56:49.651 --> 00:56:53.430
running out.
I kind of think I am,
I'm too old,
but I don't want to lose her.

943
00:56:53.431 --> 00:56:55.560
I like kids,
but they seem like a lot of work.

944
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.590
Oh,
those kids,
you know,
it seemed like a lot of work said,

945
00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:07.520
seemed like a lot of work.
Even if completely healthy Jesus Christ.
Dude,

946
00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.990
even more,
if they have any issues,
Jesus,
dude,
I can then,
you know,

947
00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:13.760
you're one of those guys that shouldn't have had kids.

948
00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.830
Not sure I got the energy for that.

949
00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:19.250
I want to travel and go to shows and drink and continue to be selfish,

950
00:57:19.251 --> 00:57:22.520
but in some way it sounds kind of cool.
Please help.

951
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:27.670
Maybe Nia has a take a p s Stewart Copeland is the greatest drummer of all time

952
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:32.000
capital and you know,
it's true.
Uh,
yeah,

953
00:57:32.001 --> 00:57:35.150
he's one of the greats and if that's your greatest drum of all time,

954
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:38.750
I wouldn't argue that,
you know,
to each his own.
Um,

955
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.090
hey dude,
if you want to do it,
go ahead and do it.
I don't think it's a world,

956
00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:44.883
you know,

957
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:49.840
and I think it's really like as far as like the work,

958
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:52.960
it's,
it's the first,
I think three,
four years.

959
00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:56.290
Once they get around five and they kind of know right from wrong,

960
00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.440
then you kinda got a buddy,
he's still going to be a pain in the ass,

961
00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:03.970
but you know,
he's going to the bathroom himself,
you know,
or herself or whatever.

962
00:58:03.971 --> 00:58:07.720
They kind of know right from wrong and then they think you're a god.

963
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.940
So like the next fucking seven years,

964
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.820
even though there's still going to throw temper tantrums of shit by the time to

965
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:17.200
seven or eight,
I mean,
yet if you did the fucking job and you're raised him,

966
00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:21.430
right,
you gotta have a pretty cool kid and then,
uh,
you know,

967
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.670
enjoy the next five years because then once they become teenagers,

968
00:58:24.671 --> 00:58:26.800
they think they fucking know everything and just pray to God.

969
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.610
They don't get knocked up or knock somebody up.
I get addicted to drugs.

970
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:35.530
It's really,
once they turn 13,
you just trying to get them through education,

971
00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:40.510
getting a good job and not marrying a fucking psycho.
And if you do that,

972
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:43.150
then I think then you can finally fucking breathe a little bit.

973
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:47.860
That's what it seems like.
But um,
yeah,
it's a lot of work,

974
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:51.490
but there's a part of you that wants to do it.
So if you want to do it,

975
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:55.510
I would say do it now.
It's no,
never.
All right.

976
00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:00.130
X Lady called me up.
Hey Billy bitch.
Tits a easy.

977
00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:03.580
Jesus Christ.
I hope your meeting,
your weight loss goals.

978
00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:07.090
I love listening to your podcast at the gym,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

979
00:59:07.091 --> 00:59:10.300
Go Fuck Yourself.
Oh,
speaking of drum,
and by the way,

980
00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:12.700
I did the Goddamn comedy jam three times last week.

981
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:17.230
I got to play up live in a club now.
What a fucking,
what a thrill that is.

982
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:21.800
What a fucking thrill.
You know,
I want to thank Josh,
Adam Meyers and everybody,

983
00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:24.360
uh,
in the band,
Joel,

984
00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:29.070
Jay and nick for putting up with me and my awful fucking playing.
Um,

985
00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:32.280
I was actually totally relaxed the whole week when I was playing,
you know,

986
00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:35.610
I fucked up a lot,
but,
uh,
I just kept going.

987
00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.820
I didn't drop time too much,
you know,
I don't think I,
you know,

988
00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.880
I fucked up Phil's,
there's a couple,
you know,

989
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:45.300
double hits and the bass drum that I would like sounded like mud,

990
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.140
but whatever snare was right there on the toured four,
nobody noticed.
Um,

991
00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.380
but what a fucking great time that is.

992
00:59:53.010 --> 00:59:56.160
I can't imagine traveling with three other people and being in a band and being

993
00:59:56.161 --> 01:00:00.930
fucking broke.
But I,
I can tell you right now,
sitting behind a set of drums,

994
01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.430
you know,
best seat in the fucking house,

995
01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:06.780
watching everybody else in the band going fucking nuts and actually see and

996
01:00:06.781 --> 01:00:10.890
people like into it is,
is one of the fucking coolest things I've ever got to do.

997
01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.040
So,
uh,
I'll be doing a lot more of those in the future.

998
01:00:14.041 --> 01:00:17.070
Why the fuck not that fun is hell.
Anyways,

999
01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:20.550
I love listening to your podcast at the gym,
Yada Yada,
Yada.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1000
01:00:20.551 --> 01:00:23.340
I need some advice about this x lady.

1001
01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:26.820
I used to date a few years back at the end of college.

1002
01:00:26.821 --> 01:00:29.190
She recently sent me a message wanting to hang out.

1003
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.210
I asked her about a situation or a situation from a friend.

1004
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.430
The lady is moving in in seven weeks and uh,

1005
01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:42.540
and quit her job.
Wait a minute,

1006
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.510
I just started daydream and halfway through that I was thinking about drumming.

1007
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.580
Isn't that weird?
You can actually do that.
Well,

1008
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:51.720
somebody else keeps reading and talking.
All right.
I need some advice about this.

1009
01:00:51.721 --> 01:00:53.010
Actually I stayed a few years back.

1010
01:00:53.011 --> 01:00:56.620
She recently sent me a message wanting to hang out as four to six situated for

1011
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.050
the lady is moving in seven,
seven weeks and quit her job.

1012
01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:05.940
I figured she was looking for a quick fling before she left.
Ah,
Bill,

1013
01:01:05.941 --> 01:01:07.110
I thought I had struck gold.

1014
01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:11.340
I really did one and a half months of no strings attached fun and then she would

1015
01:01:11.341 --> 01:01:13.980
just be fucking gone.
You idiot.

1016
01:01:13.981 --> 01:01:17.010
You probably saw too much and now she thinks is a reason to stay.

1017
01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.570
Never have to see you again.
Anyways,

1018
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:24.590
I agree to hang out with her and that's when she tells me that she is homeless.

1019
01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:31.920
Ah,
Jesus Christ,
she's homeless.

1020
01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.120
How the fuck is she calling you?

1021
01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:39.090
She fucked up or lease and is out seven weeks before she leaves.

1022
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.200
So now I'm hanging out with her in one week.

1023
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:48.230
My question for you parentheses and maybe a wife could help,

1024
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.980
uh,
add some female charm to the answer.
How do I bang her?

1025
01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:57.330
Oh my God,
but not have to let her live with me for two months.
You know what?

1026
01:01:57.331 --> 01:02:01.920
I got to put down the mic for half a second and just applaud you for admitting

1027
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:06.150
to the exact selfish piece of shit thing that you want to do.
Hang on a second.

1028
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.990
Got To love honesty.
Even if you don't like the what somebody wants to do,

1029
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:14.543
I think she,

1030
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:18.390
I should probably just go for it and worry about that situation later.

1031
01:02:18.391 --> 01:02:21.770
What do you thank you and please go fuck yourself.

1032
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:26.780
A redheaded dope like yourself.
All right,

1033
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:30.100
my freckles in arms here.
Um,

1034
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.360
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1035
01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.120
<v 0>All right.
How do I bang her but not have to live with her?
Oh,</v>

1036
01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:40.360
simple.
You just put her up in a motel and you say you're going to pay for it.

1037
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:44.740
That's what I would do as fucking filthy man.

1038
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.550
Jesus Christ put up in a fucking hotel.
It'd be cheap.
She's not fucking homeless.

1039
01:02:48.551 --> 01:02:51.570
She'll feel obligated to Banga you've already banging before.

1040
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.530
Won't feel so filthy and that's what you could do.

1041
01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:56.500
I might need a shower after this fucking answer,

1042
01:02:56.501 --> 01:03:00.460
but that I would just say that that's the way to go.
By no means letter ever.

1043
01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:01.720
Stay over at your house.

1044
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.610
Do not ever fuck over at your house fucker at the motel that you put her up in.

1045
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.130
That's what you need to do.
Okay?

1046
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.660
She can not come over your fucking house if she asks you.
Why?

1047
01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:15.490
Just say,
just be honest.

1048
01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:16.760
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1049
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.540
<v 0>Just be honest.
Just say,
cause I'm not.
You know what dude?</v>

1050
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:22.663
Um,

1051
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.013
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1052
01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.060
<v 0>this is really fucked up.
She's calling you in a time of need.</v>

1053
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:32.950
She's gone it cause she's homeless ladies moving a seven weeks and quit her job.

1054
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.630
Uh,
dude,
she might be on drugs.

1055
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:39.690
She fucked up or least she's moving at.
I Dunno dude.

1056
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:45.120
I Dunno man.
You might be fucking a somebody who's a using needles here,
man.

1057
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.810
You know what I say,
dude,
I got one for you.

1058
01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.660
Why don't you fucking rub one out and then think about it.
Oh,
he says,
ps,

1059
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:55.080
when is your next special coming out?

1060
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.660
I think I speak for everyone when I say I can't wait to see it.

1061
01:03:57.661 --> 01:04:01.740
Well that's very nice.
Um,
well I put them out every two years.
So I came out,

1062
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.980
the last one came out in December.
Every little more than two years.

1063
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.970
So this is my year off where I just get the fuck around and have a great time,

1064
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:13.590
which I'm doing and I'm,
I'm already,
you know,

1065
01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:16.380
I have some ideas about where I want to shoot my next one,

1066
01:04:16.381 --> 01:04:21.120
what I want it to look like,
and I'm just waiting for the material to come.
But,

1067
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:25.950
uh,
I'm really,
I'm really happy.
I'll tell you I'm real.
I'll tell you,

1068
01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:28.950
I'm really happy with where my act was this past weekend when I was up in

1123
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:38.550
I sent it the Saint Jude's children's hospital because that seems to be like an

1124
01:07:38.551 --> 01:07:42.720
open up charity.
All right,
there you go.
Alright.
Dilemma.

1125
01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:43.930
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1126
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:48.930
<v 0>Would you rather do a show with no swearing or take a bath with Oprah also with</v>

1127
01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:50.644
no swearing.

1128
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:52.223
<v 4>Uh,</v>

1129
01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.580
<v 0>I wouldn't subject Oprah to taking a bath with me.
I do a show,
not swearing.</v>

1130
01:07:56.581 --> 01:07:58.410
I've done that.
I could do that.

1131
01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:00.010
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1132
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:06.030
<v 0>Underrated.
Overrated.
These are from me,
underrated.
Calling it a night.</v>

1133
01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:10.920
That's what I learned when I was in Montreal when I wasn't drinking and I was

1134
01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:14.040
just sitting there slam and waters and everything.
It got to that fucking point.

1135
01:08:14.041 --> 01:08:14.874
Like,
you know what?

1136
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:17.450
There's a point where you saw everything that's going to happen.

1137
01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.460
Everything else is just going to get messy.

1138
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.870
Get home now where you can still wake up early and fucking workout.
Uh,

1139
01:08:23.871 --> 01:08:27.620
also underrated drinking water's while everyone else is getting fucked up.

1140
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:31.940
It's tremendous.
It's tremendous.
Everybody starts slurring.

1141
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:36.941
They say crazy shit to you and right as they're getting just completely not even

1142
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.560
tolerable,
you just fucking walk out and they don't even notice.

1143
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.160
I'm also underrated working out in the morning.

1144
01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:44.570
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1145
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:49.570
<v 0>Stepping on the scale after pushing a buck 90 a month ago and seeing one 81</v>

1146
01:08:50.151 --> 01:08:53.120
eight 0.0.
All right.

1147
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:57.260
Overrated after parties rich food and buying new shit.

1148
01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.040
You buy new shit and then it gets with your old shit.
Next thing you know,

1149
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:04.100
you're fucking Romas,
Phil.
It's filled up.
You know what I mean?

1150
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:08.300
You gotta get underrated.
Getting rid of shit.
I got stuff in my garage.

1151
01:09:08.301 --> 01:09:11.840
I have old DVDs.
Would you guys still buy DVDs?
If I put them up on my website?

1152
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:15.920
A lot of graph,
all of them just to get them out of my garage.
I'm going to do it.

1153
01:09:15.921 --> 01:09:18.850
I think there's a few older people out there listening to the podcasts that are

1154
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:22.430
old school like me and they want,
you know,
they want the gold behind their money.

1155
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.390
They don't want to digitally own it.
They want to have the hard copy.
Um,

1156
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:30.260
all right,
that's going to be the podcast for this week.
Uh,
what a week I had,
man,

1157
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:34.640
Montreal,
Ottawa.
You guys were unbelievable.
Such great fans up there.

1158
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:39.270
A goddamn comedy jam.
Josh,
Joel,
Jay and nick.

1159
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:42.890
Thank you guys for putting up with my drumming and a thank you to everybody that

1160
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:45.720
came out to my shows.
Um,

1161
01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:52.070
what else?
What else?
Who else did I want to thank God dammit.

1162
01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.600
I can't fucking remember.
Anyways,
I'm the worst.

1163
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.880
I gotta stay,
you know I did.
All right.
This week I actually made some list.

1164
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.880
Anyways,
this is going to take me forever to upload because my Internet sucks.

1165
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:08.180
So I got an hour and 10 minutes here.
Guys.
Have a good weekend on Thursday.

1166
01:10:08.181 --> 01:10:11.690
I'll check in on you there.
All right,
go fuck yourself.
I'll talk to you later.
