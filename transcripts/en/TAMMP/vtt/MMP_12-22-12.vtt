7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.300
before I do this podcast,
right?
Oh man,
I got nothing to talk about this weekend.

8
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:35.500
No.
Why?
Cause old freckles is on fucking vacation.

9
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.470
<v 2>All right.</v>

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.440
<v 1>I'm not doing shit.
I'm not doing it and I'm not through a fog.</v>

11
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.110
You don't want to fuck with

12
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.600
<v 2>bt good.
Bd is on vacation,</v>

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.260

14
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.830
<v 1>Bitch,
I'm gonna kill you.</v>

15
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.813
<v 2>MMM.</v>

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.180
<v 1>I have absolutely nothing to talk about because I've been in a fucking writer's</v>

17
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:07.960
room and uh,
they had a lactic gig and I had been in the fucking bubble.

18
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.990
I have no idea what's going on in the world right now other than Sony leaks.

19
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.420
Everybody freaking out about Sony leaks.
Did you have to just read any?
No,

20
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:18.670
I didn't read any of the fucking things.
Why would I read that?

21
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:20.710
It's somebody else's email.
You fucking Weirdo.

22
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.020
Once you stand outside their window and rub your Dick,

23
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.083
<v 2>you know</v>

24
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.420
<v 1>you're a piece of shit.
If you read any of those fucking emails,</v>

25
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.290
that's all I'm saying.
Okay?
Because be honest with yourself.

26
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.780
If somebody stole your fucking all your Shit,

27
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.250
<v 0>okay?</v>

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.220
<v 1>You wouldn't be in trouble.
You wouldn't be a little nervous.</v>

29
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.830
You don't get a dick pic or a fucking or something.

30
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.400
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

31
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.840
<v 1>you didn't look at something weird.</v>

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.100
<v 0>Okay?</v>

33
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.933
<v 1>All right?</v>

34
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.390
You didn't trash the fucking chick one cubicle over cause you want to fuck her

35
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:56.800
and she won't.
So he starts saying she's a lesbian or she's frigid or some shit.

36
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.600
You probably said it way worse than that

37
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.623
<v 2>right</v>

38
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.010
<v 1>now.
You're going to hold these people.</v>

39
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.750
You're going to hold these people accountable,

40
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.170
these wonderful people over at Sony that make movies for your snot nose fucking

41
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:13.230
kids to watch.
So you can go on the other Roman fucking steal a fucking

42
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.900
<v 0>okay,</v>

43
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.860
<v 1>20 minutes of sleep.
You know,</v>

44
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:20.800
maybe go walk out onto your balcony and fucking hustle a little

45
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.820
smoke a little weed.
Why does that moment happened?

46
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940
Because of people like Sony making movies about fucking stereotypical characters

47
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.340
on rugs flying around the Middle East,
right?

48
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.030
Talking planes and talk and cars.

49
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.000
<v 0>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.310
<v 1>Fat People with no legs talking to computers,</v>

51
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.050
all those fucking movies just because of people like them.
And what do you do?

52
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:48.920
You turn around,

53
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.460
you find out that they're fucking emails or on the Internet and what do you do?

54
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:53.300
You piece of shit.

55
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.280
How do you repay them for shutting your fucking snot nose kid up for two and a

56
00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.590
half fucking two hours,
whatever.

57
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.070
Because of those wonderful people over at Sony,

58
00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.010
you can take you a dumb ass kid that only you find cute.

59
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.290
Prop him up in front of the fucking TV and he can sit there at Goddamn
catatonic,

60
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.170
you know?
Well,
maybe you got time to go rub one out.

61
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.900
I'll go pour yourself a fucking whiskey.

62
00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:22.080
Or maybe just have a couple of minutes to yourself and enjoy a piece of toast.

63
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.090
How do you repay them?

64
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.610
You immediately sit down in the fucking and your computer and you go and you

65
00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:34.040
read the fucking emails
during the holiday season.

66
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.590
How dare you?
Yeah,
I could give a fuck about all of it.

67
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.300
Um,
I don't understand why they pulled the fucking movie though.

68
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.663
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.770
<v 1>Do you really think the al Qaeda was going to do that shift?</v>

70
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.490
Let's just say they were behind nine 11.
Who knows at this point,
right?

71
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.770
That's like,

72
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.630
you know who came up with the fucking grilled cheese sandwich at this point?

73
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:04.370
Everybody's claim responsibility.
I was my,
it was my aunt Harriet.

74
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.070
She lived in Wisconsin or some fucking bullshit.
Right?

75
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.670
Everybody's claimed fucking responsibility.
Everyone's been blamed for that.

76
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:18.530
From Saddam to al Qaeda to your buddy named Fred down the fucking street.

77
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.420
All right,
so let's just say that these guys,
you know,

78
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.140
these fucking 600 people on a jungle gym,

79
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.490
half a world away did this shit.
All right.
Let's just say they did it.

80
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.600
It telling me that they're going to go from knocking down buildings and a and a

81
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.940
and fucking blown up the Pentagon to attack in a movie theater.

82
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.680
Doesn't that seem like anticlimactic?
That's Kinda,

83
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.950
it's Kinda like as a comedian,

84
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:54.450
you would start with your best joke and then it just fucking tapers off from

85
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:59.310
there and then slowly you're just like the crowds just staring at you.

86
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.140
I mean,
I would think their next move would be something even bigger.
Right?

87
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.140
You think right?
If murdering innocent people is an art,

88
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.140
you'd want to progress like anybody else.

89
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:17.200
Does a guitar player want to be worse than he was the day before?

90
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.280
I don't think he does.

91
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.250
We got more movie theaters then they have members in al Qaeda.

92
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.970
I don't understand what the fucking problems.
What are they going to do?

93
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.210
They just gonna walk in.

94
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.380
They're going to get all those fucking cunts over here.

95
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.680
I guess they were just going to do it to one.
I don't know.

96
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.490
It just seemed like a pussy move.
We just caved.

97
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.250
We fucking caved.
Now what now?
What?
What's the next thing?

98
00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:52.730
They're going to fucking threat.
Oh,
Jesus.
Am I doing that argument?

99
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.680
Yes.
We can't read newspapers.

100
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.541
<v 0>I don't give a really,</v>

101
00:06:03.541 --> 00:06:06.930
I don't really give a shit about any fucking story in the news.
Uh,

102
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.300
unless it's some local guy did something heroic.

103
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.160
If it's somebody who saved a fucking animal or raw,

104
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.030
they're talking about what a piece of shit banks and insurance companies are.

105
00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:19.560
Other than that,
I don't,
I don't care.

106
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.370
<v 1>I don't care.
I don't like the environment.
I'm over the environment.</v>

107
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.560
We're going to destroy it.

108
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.683
<v 0>You know,</v>

109
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.180
<v 1>people are going to sit there and deny that we have any sort of effect on the</v>

110
00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:37.260
climate of this fucking planet.
Why now?
Why would we,

111
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.890
why would we do we,
we live on land and we've ruined the oceans.

112
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.260
How could we ever affect the climate?

113
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.910
There's over 1 trillion pieces of fucking plastic in the goddamn emotion.

114
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.770
We live on the land people.
How does that happen?

115
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.750
Is there a shark fucking up your backyard?
I don't think there is.

116
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.180
We're essentially the worst fucking thing on the planet and the coolest thing,

117
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.190
you know what I mean?
Cause we have an invention as far as I know,

118
00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:12.960
no other animal on this planet has ever invented anything.
Not a fucking thing.

119
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.600
You know,
we get all excited.

120
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.450
You get all excited when you see your dog uses hands is like a pair of pause.

121
00:07:18.451 --> 00:07:19.630
The whole the fucking bone.

122
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.350
<v 3>Oh God.
Oh No.
Oh,
the bonus trade up and down.</v>

123
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.483
<v 0>Right.</v>

124
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.570
<v 1>We can make a robot dog at this point here that Cleo,
you're obsolete.</v>

125
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.153
<v 0>MMM.</v>

126
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.190
<v 1>Yeah.
I Dunno.
I don't even know any,
anything that what the fuck is going on.</v>

127
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:43.150
But you know something.
The next time somebody's account gets hacked,

128
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:45.580
why don't you have a little bit of empathy going like,
Hey,
you know,

129
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:49.210
I wouldn't like that to happen to me and just leave him the fuck alone.

130
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.430
Who gives a shit?
It's talking shit about different fucking people.

131
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:57.460
Of course they are.
This what people do.
That's what everybody does.

132
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

133
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.910
<v 1>Me An old Joe de Rosa.
We get on the phone.</v>

134
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.650
Sometimes we'll call another fucking comedian and all three of us will just sit

135
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:08.360
there.
W first we start off,

136
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:12.230
we trash each other and then the circle just gets bigger and bigger.

137
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.880
Start trashing other people we know and sometimes what trash is somebody so,

138
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:20.390
well,
we actually call that person up because we don't want them to miss it.

139
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.840
Um,
anyways.
Who gives a fuck?

140
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.830
The Sony leaks acting like somebody broke into the fucking Pentagon.

141
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.710
Um,
anyways,
this is the Monday morning podcast.
Uh,

142
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.670
I'm fucking site.
I'm psyched.

143
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:43.130
The downstairs in my house is basically finished.

144
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:45.440
They get a couple of knickknack things at this point I'm over.

145
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.450
We actually moved in to the downstairs area.
Oh my God.
I was going to fucking,

146
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.060
I don't know what I was going to do.

147
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:55.520
I was going to take a bucket of water and dump it over.
My wife said other day,

148
00:08:55.521 --> 00:08:59.260
right.
She wants to move the fucking bed downstairs.
Okay.
But the,

149
00:08:59.261 --> 00:09:00.950
the workers still have to come here in the morning.

150
00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:02.450
They got to do a little touch up paint.

151
00:09:02.451 --> 00:09:06.380
They got fucking fixed days and that's a little off,
you know,

152
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.560
sand this thing down and she's all hot to trot to get the goddamn bed

153
00:09:11.631 --> 00:09:15.020
downstairs.
All right.
And I get it.
I get it.
I understand.

154
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.910
When a man pays for a house,
it's not his house,
it's the woman's house.

155
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.310
It's a giant doll house and they're gonna fucking decorate it.

156
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:24.380
And they already knew what they were going to put in the fucking thing when they

157
00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:28.250
were like seven years old.
Okay.
And I gave in to that shit.
I'm like,
yeah,
fine,

158
00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:31.250
fine,
whatever.
You know,
go nuts.
Go nuts.

159
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:35.090
Because someday I'm going to Redo that fucking garage.
Okay.

160
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.890
I want to Redo that fucking garage.

161
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.010
I'm going to add a second floor to it and I'm going to only,

162
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:42.380
I will have keys to it.
And uh,
whenever I'm sick of you,

163
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:43.520
I'm just going to fucking go in there.

164
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.670
I'm sick of fucking dreaming about a house that has a garage that's separate

165
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:49.400
from the house.
I kind of have that in a way.

166
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.790
I'll just build a fucking upstairs and I will just say,

167
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.330
you are not allowed up there.
You know,
what do you think she's going to do?

168
00:09:56.331 --> 00:10:00.380
Do you think she can actually leave it alone?
She bold.
She wants.
So anyways,

169
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.030
she wants to bring the bed downstairs.
Cle bed we have in the fucking house,

170
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.250
right.
We had a guest bed,
but it was out in the garage and the rain came down,

171
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.380
fucked up the mattress.
So we don't have,
while we have as a box spring upstairs,

172
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.010
what happened?
She gets to fucking people to put the goddamn bed there.

173
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.270
So we go downstairs.
All right.
Both of us had gone out the night before.

174
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.850
We were out until two two 30 in the fucking morning.

175
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.330
Now we're sleeping downstairs and who shows up at seven in the morning?

176
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.450
The fucking workers.
So now we got to get up.

177
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.880
We could've kept sleeping if we were upstairs.
So we get up,
we get up,

178
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.860
we walk upstairs and I'm not saying shit and we go upstairs and the only place

179
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:41.330
to sleep as the fucking couch.

180
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.990
And she goes and she just fucking lays down right in the goddamn couch and

181
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:47.570
immediately goes to sleep.
And I'm like,
what the fuck am I supposed to sleep?

182
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.030
She mumbled something and went back to sleep.

183
00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:52.040
So I had to grab two cushions off the back of the couch,

184
00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:57.041
walk in if fucking build like a mini bed on top of this fucking box spring.

185
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.290
And I went in there and I slept.
And uh,

186
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.250
was I in a fucking mood that day?
Jesus fucking Christ.

187
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:05.720
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

188
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.410
<v 1>Yeah.
But my wife is the shit.
While she's smarter,
she's smart as hell.</v>

189
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:13.350
Cause afterwards when she asked me why I was being so snippy,

190
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:15.030
when I explained the scenario,

191
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.730
she apologized and it was sincere and she really meant it.

192
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.630
So then I was just left with this fucking anger.
I had nothing to do with right.

193
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:30.390
So I just went over my dog and I just put it in a headlock.
Right.

194
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.510
I just started fucking slum kid.
Um,

195
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.780
and it was this recent fucking advertising here for this week.

196
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.540
But my Christmas tree leap,
yeah,
went down there.
It's pretty good though.

197
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:44.670
The good people,
they didn't have a bunch of Charlie Brown Christmas trees.

198
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.840
Even though I like those ones,

199
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.240
I always feel bad for them or I just think they want them.

200
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:51.630
It's look better when there's less branches.
So to that fucking

201
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.810
shrub shaped like a ghost that most Christmas trees are actually bought a

202
00:11:57.811 --> 00:12:02.460
Christmas tree that I'm taller than
just bought a little one.

203
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:03.841
You know,

204
00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:06.510
my truck's still is storage because those workers still have this shit in the

205
00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:08.730
garage.
Is this slowly fucking,
you know,

206
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.690
they're leaving my house the way we're leaving Afghanistan,
you know,

207
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.090
one tank at a time.
And um,

208
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.060
I dunno.
So,
and I usually just,
you know,

209
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:22.240
go on and get full size fucking tree and I just throw it in the back of my truck

210
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.790
and I drive down the street.
Like I'm a man and I know how to fix things,

211
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.760
you know.
But uh,
this year all I had was the Prius.

212
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:29.830
So what am I going to do is stick a giant fucking tree on there.

213
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.410
I'm not just give me a precise Christmas tree.

214
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.870
I could actually bullied my Christmas tree.

215
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.560
I could walk up to it and take all the ornaments in.
It wouldn't do anything,

216
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.160
could just stare at the fucking floor boards.
It's kind of sad.
And then I went,

217
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.330
this is our latest started got,

218
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:45.170
then I bought when I was eight called point sitios.

219
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.420
Those fucking red flowers bought them at the grocery store.

220
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.170
But the two last ones looking like a bought the,

221
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.950
they're all shriveled up looking like a junkie,

222
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.810
just sort of not enough or whatever.
And uh,

223
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.180
that's it.
Through some bulbs on it.

224
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.900
Put those fucking flowers on either side of the fireplace and it's over.

225
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.100
It's Christmas time.
So I do it.

226
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.150
I'm sorry guys.
I don't fucking have anything.
You know what I have,

227
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.540
I have some information for you.
Uh,
the Patrice O'Neal benefit everybody.

228
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.150
Slowly but surely this benefit is going to fuck it.
Sell out.

229
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.970
This is always a bitch.
Every God year,
you know,

230
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.620
hyping this thing around the holidays,
I'd love to get a tick is,

231
00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:33.420
but I have to buy a scar from my aunt.
Um,
all right,

232
00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:34.440
Patrice O'Neal benefit.

233
00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:39.330
The third annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit is Wednesday,

241
00:14:11.381 --> 00:14:16.381
great fucking Christmas gift and a really helps us that do a wonderful thing for

242
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:19.710
the great Patrice O'Neil.
Um,

243
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.840
and whatever the box office window is.

244
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:26.800
One 31 west 55th street between sixth and Seventh Av.

245
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.760
And while I'm at it,
um,

246
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.100
if you guys are fans of the Rose Bowl and you live in the Lorraine,

247
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.950
is it Lorraine,
Ohio?

248
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.590
Lorraine Catholic was the name of the school that Jason Law had went to a rose

249
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.540
bowl lesson legend and grill master.

250
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

251
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.870
<v 1>Jason Law head is going to be performing a theater.</v>

252
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.740
This is a very unique show in Lorain,

253
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.860
Ohio and his hall of fame.

254
00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.103
Uh,

255
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.770
high school basketball coach father is going to be opening up telling stories.

256
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:08.320
I don't think I've ever seen a father open up for a son at a standup show,

257
00:15:08.321 --> 00:15:13.220
much less the hall of fame basketball coach who's going to be telling stories in

258
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.200
a couple of years ago.
And we did that bus tour through the south.
Uh,

259
00:15:17.201 --> 00:15:20.830
he came along with us and it just really one of the most amazing human beings I

260
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:22.820
ever met.
Uh,

261
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:26.710
I think that's December 27th we'll have all that information if you want to go

262
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.500
once again,
that,
that also makes a great care Christmas gift.
Yeah.
Um,
so

263
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.510
I haven't been doing shit.
You know what I do?

264
00:15:34.511 --> 00:15:37.460
You know what I do whenever the downtown comes around again as they fucking,

265
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.240
I get into cooking,

266
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.200
speaking at Jason Lawhead and last night for the first time ever,

267
00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:47.590
I usually am a grill guy and pork chops.

268
00:15:47.591 --> 00:15:51.910
I always broil them cause that's how I learned how to make them when I was a
kid.

269
00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:52.744
You just broil them.

270
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.060
I'm just going to pause here and wait for all the food has to be like,
oh,

271
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.150
that you brew.
Um,

272
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.000
I actually pan seared.

273
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:02.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

274
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.500
<v 1>Pan seared is fucking pork chops last night and they were fucking delicious.</v>

275
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.520
Brown them up on both sides and a skillet.
Right.

276
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.360
And then I took the skillet and I stuck it in the oven at 400 degrees

277
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.690
for like another five,
six minutes.
Probably should add him in there for seven.

278
00:16:18.691 --> 00:16:22.650
They were pretty thick and uh,
took those fuckers out.

279
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.350
And I had this magazine,
the Tacho how to do,
uh,
uh,
it's called a butter bath.

280
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.550
I know,
I know.
I'm putting on weight here.

281
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.090
He just dropped some butter into the skillet afterwards.

282
00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:37.980
You don't even have to have it on.
He did spend on the fucking oven,

283
00:16:37.981 --> 00:16:38.870
so it's already hot,
right?

284
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.740
You just drop it in there and you throw in some sage brush sage time and ask

285
00:16:43.741 --> 00:16:47.190
some rosemary,
couple of fucking little garlic,

286
00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:50.940
a lot of knuckles whenever the fuck you call those things.

287
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.690
And he let that wants to bubble bubbles and the butterfly come up.

288
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.750
You just spoon it up and you drop it on the fucking porkchop forget it.

289
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.160
They'll fuck yourself.

290
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.470
Then you'd take the pork chop and Olivia cooked it for you.

291
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:03.960
Slap him in the face with you.
Say,

292
00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:07.090
eat that shit and don't wipe the grease off your face around,

293
00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:08.980
never cooked for you again.
I'll tell you,

294
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.680
they'll sit down and read that whole fucking thing with a smile on their face

295
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.370
and grease with rosemary in it right on the side of their face and they won't

296
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:18.610
feel humil humiliated at all as a true story.

297
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.790
That's what I did last night.
Um,

298
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.820

299
00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:29.140
goes off the rails.
Okay?
Uh,

Um,
why don't we go here?

300
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.270
I actually don't have this at my fingertips anymore cause I had to fucking get a

301
00:17:34.271 --> 00:17:38.000
new operating system.
And then like the notes thing where I write my,
uh,

302
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.130
ideas or whatever,

303
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.700
I have to sign up for some shit and they want all this fucking information.

304
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.590
Fucking Weirdos.
All right,

305
00:17:47.591 --> 00:17:51.260
Everybody don't get your tensile in a tangle.

306
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:57.110
Is this Thursday?
Have you checked every one off your list?
Don't sweat it.

307
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.860
I can help avoid stressing out about what last minute gift to get.

308
00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:05.810
Sherry's berries is a unique gift that is sure to be a hit and it's just a click

309
00:18:05.811 --> 00:18:10.430

I'll get them chocolate strawberries.

311
00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:15.920
This is the gift to give somebody that you got to get them a gift just to show

312
00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:19.220
you making a fucking effort.
All right,
Sherry's berries.
Don't get,

313
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.300
Don't get beside yourself.
All right.
Ah,
Shit.

314
00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:24.740
I forgot to get my mother a gift.

315
00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:26.690
I think we'll get a chocolate covered strawberries.

316
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.880
You'll fucking Disonia is a gift.
You get that broad,
you're banging,

317
00:18:31.881 --> 00:18:34.860
but you're not going to commit to the relationship.
All right.

318
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.960
Was the only one day left to shop.
Your time is limited.

319
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.510
Give this incredible delicious gift and skip the crowds all together by Sherry's

320
00:18:44.511 --> 00:18:47.160

322
00:18:51.201 --> 00:18:55.610
you can double those berries,
right?
For only $10 more.

323
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.690
Christmas isn't three days and we can still guarantee the delivery by Christmas.

324
00:18:59.691 --> 00:19:02.180
You just need my code to take advantage of the deal,

Describe the barriers in your own words.

327
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.400
Try using advertising adjectives like decadent,
fresh,
juicy,

328
00:19:13.401 --> 00:19:17.960
sweet and irresistible.
All right,

Makes me hate fat people.

333
00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:39.270
Is it really tempting?
Oh,

335
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.510
Top Wall.
Right?
But we get the fucking point.
What am I doing it?

336
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.800
Visit [inaudible] dot com spell out the word Barry's,
B e r r I e s.com.

Yeah,

339
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.900
it is the perfect gift.
Who the fuck wants to go to a store?
You know,

340
00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:03.820
I wanted to go buy some workout clothes to my wife.

341
00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:06.790
So I went down to the Nike store and when I showed up the other day on a

342
00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.650
Saturday,
right before Christmas,

343
00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:12.220
there was a line of fucking people out the store.
And I'm thinking like,
oh,

344
00:20:12.221 --> 00:20:14.850
this has to be those sneaker heads,
right?
This guy,

345
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.960
they're reissuing a fucking Patrick Ewings jock strap and all these guys,

346
00:20:19.961 --> 00:20:22.150
all it's fucking dope.
I got to get it right.

347
00:20:22.151 --> 00:20:23.680
So I figure I could just walk all around it.

348
00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:26.620
But I was stopped at a red light and I looked at everybody in line and it was

349
00:20:26.621 --> 00:20:30.730
all different aged people,
older people and Shit.
And I was like,
oh my God,

350
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:33.620
that's the line to get in the store.
Uh,

351
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.180
looks like somebody who's not getting workout clothes and now that wasn't going

352
00:20:37.181 --> 00:20:39.130
to be the main gift.
That was just one of those things,
you know,

353
00:20:39.131 --> 00:20:43.420
to fill out the area around the tree sweatpants.
A great takes up space.

They lock up the raises in maximum security plastic.

390
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:48.910
Why do they do that?

391
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.240
You have to stand around like a convict waiting for the guard to come over and

392
00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:54.430
unlock the raise a case.
What do they think?

418
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.720
let's talk some fucking little bit of football this week.
Patriots,
jets.
Good.

419
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:28.350
Have you ever seen an uglier when?
Good Lord,

420
00:24:28.351 --> 00:24:32.210
that was an ugly fucking game.
Um,

421
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.020
I actually think the judge should have won that game and my,

422
00:24:34.021 --> 00:24:39.021
on my fucking mind and Gino Smith's should not be blamed for both of those sacs.

423
00:24:39.421 --> 00:24:41.790
The second one and he said hike.
There was a guy in his face,

424
00:24:41.791 --> 00:24:46.440
but that the first one that took him out of field goal range to the point the

425
00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:50.640
guy had to kick it low and Vince Wilfork a fucking 350 pound guy,

426
00:24:50.641 --> 00:24:53.790
somehow blocked a field goal.
Um,

427
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.270
I would blame him on that one,
but I'll tell you who I wouldn't blame.

428
00:24:57.271 --> 00:25:02.220
I wouldn't blame Rex Ryan.
I,
uh,
as much as I think that guy,
uh,

429
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:06.320
has no class,
and then when he gets called on it,

430
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:10.310
he acts like a baby.
You know,
we talk talks,
all kinds of shit.

431
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.580
And then when they lose,
he's like,
you know,
people go to cruise sizes too,

432
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:15.410
but they have no right to,
yeah,
they do.

433
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.900
They don't get talked to a bunch of shit and said you were going to win the

434
00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:22.850
whole thing and then you didn't,
you set yourself up for the criticism.
Um,

435
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.210
but I still think he's a fucking great coach and I don't think that that's the

436
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:30.470
problem with that team.
When he had the players,
he got him to the uh,

437
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.820
afe stay AAFC not the AFC East,

438
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.420
the fucking AFC championship game.
Jesus bill even watched the sport.

439
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.913
But um,

440
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.030
sometimes they just make a change because they feel like it quiets the fan base.

441
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.580
They just fucking lopped somebody's head off.

442
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:48.470
But I think that that would be a fucking mistake.

443
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.610
As much as I would love to see that guy.
I don't want to see him lose his job.

444
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.220
Like maybe lose the jet job and then go over to the NFC.

445
00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:58.880
I don't fucking see that guy anymore.
He drives me up the fucking wall.

446
00:25:58.881 --> 00:26:02.870
Like when Brady through that pick and then he's running on the field fucking

447
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:03.691
pumping his fists,

448
00:26:03.691 --> 00:26:08.450
looking like some loser at the track cause it's dog finally came in,
you know,

449
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.970
I don't fucking know.
I just,
he had a,
I liked the guy,
but he just,
you know,

450
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:17.390
he talks all that shit.
And then when it's,
and then when he has a bad team,

451
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:19.730
he fucking clams up and acts like he learned a lesson.

452
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.940
Do you honestly think if rex Ryan gets another loaded team that he's not going

453
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:29.540
to start talking shit again.
Eaten Bundt cakes,

454
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:34.280
blowing out those stitches.
Um,
all right,

455
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.600
let me pull me plow ahead here and then I'm going to say my bill.

456
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:43.601
Burrs Superbowl pick standup comedian never played organized beyond the third

457
00:26:44.621 --> 00:26:47.080
grades.
Bill Barr,

458
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:51.920
his Superbowl pick bump up,
boot up.

459
00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.960
Suck my fucking Dick.
Um,

460
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.510
I'm taking Seattle Seahawks uptake.
I know that's not a bull pick,

461
00:27:04.511 --> 00:27:07.900
but I gotta tell you something.
I've never been more wrong about a coach.

462
00:27:07.901 --> 00:27:11.260
Then Pete Carroll,
I remember Pete Carroll was with the Patriots.

463
00:27:11.261 --> 00:27:15.070
He followed bill Parcells.
He comes in,
he's a little pretty boys wearing dockers.

464
00:27:15.071 --> 00:27:18.760
They make a good play.
He goes,
Woo.
I thought the guy was soft.

465
00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.400
And then when he went to college and he want to chant,

466
00:27:21.401 --> 00:27:23.020
you rebuilt the USC program.

467
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.220
They and what your dope got caught and ran out the back door when the wolves

468
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.200
started coming around.
I don't give a fuck.

469
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.620
You did what people do at Division One to win and the guy fucking one.

470
00:27:32.621 --> 00:27:36.550
And I was like,
oh,
he's a college coach.
Don't probe coach.

471
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.260
Then he fucking goes to Seattle.

472
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.200
When a fuck with Sia were the fuck with the Seattle Seahawks

473
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.740
<v 2>before Pete Carol?
Where were they?</v>

474
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.633
Nowhere.

475
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.420
<v 1>It's a bunch of star Brugge Starbucks drink and douchebags wearing Birkenstocks</v>

476
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:56.140
and those rain ponchos just standing around in the rang.

477
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.020
They were all sad.
Seattle's go and know.

478
00:27:59.021 --> 00:28:02.200
A lot of people don't realize is that's why Kurt Cobain killed himself.

479
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.280
It wasn't that the fucking all sir.
It wasn't the demons.

480
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.190
He was just sick of rooting for the mariners and the Seahawks.

481
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:18.270
So Pete Carroll goes in there with a fan base is literally suicidal and within

482
00:28:19.271 --> 00:28:22.720
five years they get a fucking Superbowl.
That's hard enough to do,

483
00:28:22.721 --> 00:28:24.520
but the hardest fucking thing to do,

484
00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:27.670
I think as a Kevin never coached at any fucking level.

485
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:33.220
I think the hardest fucking thing to do is after you win a championship is to

486
00:28:33.221 --> 00:28:36.580
come out the next year and get your team hungry again to do it again.

487
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.510
You know that Shit Pat Riley did.

488
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.510
Okay.
The Shit Bill Bellacheck did.

489
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:49.010
Like there's very few people that can motivate chuck Noll.

490
00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.750
Did it twice to get them hungry again.
Fucking Seattle,

491
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:59.090
like dare fucking defense.
I,
I,
I didn't know what to say about it.

492
00:28:59.091 --> 00:29:03.500
Like I think if they somehow,
obviously if they get fucking home field event,

493
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.680
I just don't see anybody stopping and I certainly think that the,

494
00:29:06.681 --> 00:29:11.681
the super bowl champion is going to be coming out of the NFC and I got a feeling

495
00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:15.530
that the patriots,
we get home field.
All right.

496
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.070
We got a chance to go to the Superbowl again,
but we don't have,

497
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.510
I mean anything can happen.
All right.
This is me just speaking logically.

498
00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:26.750
When I watched both teams,
I don't think that we have a shot against those guys.

499
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.120
Um,
but as a patriots fan,
I say fuck the Seahawks.

500
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:33.863
<v 2>All right.</v>

501
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.930
<v 1>I,
I can't even say that.
I mean,
I don't know what the,
what,</v>

502
00:29:37.931 --> 00:29:41.960
what are we going to do?
What the fuck did we get?
You know,

503
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.080
we're doing well in the AFC.

504
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.900
I don't know why it always gets like this always gets really unbalanced.

505
00:29:47.901 --> 00:29:51.830
Like fuck him in the beginning,
like the NFC when like the first,

506
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.090
I don't know how many fucking championships,
bowls,

507
00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.320
and then the AFC went on this fucking run where we won like,
well,
Shit,
Bill,

508
00:30:00.321 --> 00:30:05.000
you're a nerd.
You should know it went Steelers.
Steelers,
Raiders,

509
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.590
49 is one one,

510
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.480
one and 81 82 was the Redskins.

511
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

512
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.120
<v 1>83 was the Raiders and it was 49 years.</v>

513
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.200
Oh,
it was the NFC that went on the run down.

514
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:29.070
It was and the bears.
That's right.

515
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.050
That's right.
Then the NFC one on Iran.

516
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.060
AAFC was on a run and then NFC went on a run and I know one AFC now,

517
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.420
NFC again,
and I don't know why.
It always just gets like hell.
We seems like

518
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:45.590
like 60 or 70% of the NFL seasons either the AFC championship.
Oh,

519
00:30:45.591 --> 00:30:48.670
the NFC championship game.
Everybody's going,
you know who's getting,
Whoa,

520
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:52.740
this is the fucking super bowl,
and then the Superbowl becomes a blow out.

521
00:30:52.741 --> 00:30:54.450
All those fucking years.
It was a blowout.

522
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.460
The Broncos lost to the giants.
That was all right one.

523
00:30:59.461 --> 00:31:03.760
Then they get smoked by the fucking red skins.

524
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.490
After going up 14 to nothing,

525
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.380
then 49 his Bengals was great and then Broncos got raped,

526
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.530
fucking raped.
Oh,

527
00:31:13.531 --> 00:31:18.030
the pagers got raped by the bears before all that bullshit to ball 20 and a

528
00:31:18.031 --> 00:31:23.031
fucking Broncos got raped 55 to something by the 49 or 10 a close game with the

529
00:31:25.051 --> 00:31:26.670
bills giants,

530
00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:31.671
one in the Redskins handled the bills and then the bills got raped twice in a

531
00:31:31.771 --> 00:31:33.870
row by the fucking cowboys.

532
00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.990
And was it 49 his charges,
Jesus Christ.

533
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.740
That was like a bad pay per view fight,
you know.
Um,
I don't want,

534
00:31:42.741 --> 00:31:45.250
I'm talking about,
I just think the Seahawks or ah,

535
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.280
I think the too good and that fucking Wilson Kid,
that guy is the next guy.

536
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:55.400
I think he's the next guy.
Even beyond a MIP.
Androulla Andrew Luck in the AFC.

537
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.640
Even though he's having a fucking blast yesterday.
It wasn't his fault.

538
00:31:58.641 --> 00:32:01.340
Jesus Christ,
one guy drops a pass and they all fucking do it.

539
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.610
That cowboys colts game reminded me of the Superbowl last year.

540
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.010
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

541
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.860
<v 1>one bad play in the first series of downs and they never got it back.</v>

542
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.750
It's just all went off the fucking rails.

543
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

544
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:16.670
<v 1>Fucking punch it through.
That pass.
Looks like a Robert Parish foul shot.
Right?</v>

545
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:21.630
The guy's hands and he looked like me out there.
All right,

546
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.580
what am I talking about here?
Let's um,
let's move on here.

547
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:30.210
Let's get to some questions for this week.
How far into the podcast are we?

548
00:32:30.211 --> 00:32:33.060
32 fucking minutes.
Oj Simpson.
Uh,

549
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:34.500
<v 0>okay.</v>

550
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:34.821
<v 1>You don't,</v>

551
00:32:34.821 --> 00:32:39.390
I'm going to go off the rails here and I'm going to read one from my other that

552
00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:44.020
I find actually founded.
I thought we didn't have enough questions this week.

553
00:32:44.021 --> 00:32:48.340
So occasionally I'll dip into my other fucking account here to see what we got.

554
00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.160
Come on.
You old ass fucking computer.

555
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.800
So fucking slow here.
All right dear Billy,
because stanza,
uh,

556
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.180
recently or does that Jason Alexander fucking

557
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.410
<v 0>okay.</v>

558
00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:05.570
<v 1>Cause I'm bald and I yell.</v>

559
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.550
Recently I was in Boston for work and decided to visit a good old friend of mine

560
00:33:10.551 --> 00:33:12.890
from back in the day while I was visiting.

561
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:16.970
I happen to run into his younger sister who is my age.
Nothing creepy.

562
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:22.310
G in high school I was the bad boy.

563
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:26.330
Class clown.
Ah Gee.
What were you in Greece?
Fucking jerk off.

564
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.920
Just pictured.
You want a leather jacket?
I'll go is all the book up paper.

565
00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.890
Um,
I loved all those thing and jerk offs.

566
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:39.020
Like the people thought that they fucking built that car.

567
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.970
They were in the glee club.
All right.
It's the burnout,
the burnout.

568
00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:47.030
It's down the hall and fucking woodshop and the power mechanics.

569
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:49.940
They could do something like that anyways.
And she was the,
you know,

570
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:54.410
I've never seen Greece.
I've never seen it.
Whenever I turn it on,

571
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:56.480
they're always racing in the,
in the La River.

572
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.160
And I think one time I saw the ending,
but uh,

573
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.980
never seen it.
But I've seen all of Greece too.
And when I saw it,

574
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:11.360
I enjoyed it.
Um,
all right.
Plowing ahead of me.
In high school I was the bad boy.

575
00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:14.840
Class clown,
man.
You know what I mean?
Man,
I was rebel.

576
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.080
Do you have a raccoon tailing and from the antenna your car?

577
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:22.220
They are fucking shifty.
And she was the Nerdy,
antisocial,

578
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:25.880
flat chested type.
I always knew she had a thing for me,

579
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:30.530
but I was too busy chasing all the,
who was over live.
Well bill,

580
00:34:30.531 --> 00:34:35.240
it turns out she's become quite the young lady since then.

581
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.800
Master's degree,
great corporate Gig,
a great rack.

582
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:45.100
And then he writes a great rack and she happens to be single.

583
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.030
She insisted she show me.
It was so fucking funny as the way guys look at women,

584
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.350
I want to have women do that.
They just don't admit it.
And I'll turns out,

585
00:34:54.351 --> 00:34:57.580
you know,
chairs,
you know he's got a straw job,

586
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.250
a great job.
Oh,

587
00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.630
fucking fat pet movie of a big word.
What would you say?

588
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.350
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

589
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:14.280
<v 1>a nice fucking literally sitting in fucking acting like I'm grabbing Dick and</v>

590
00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:16.050
balls right now.
Trying to think of the fucking word.

591
00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:20.540
I don't know what the fuck they would say.
Do you guys ever do that?
Um,
anyways,

592
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.340
well it turns out she became quite the young lady,
blah,
Blah Blah.

593
00:35:23.341 --> 00:35:28.170
And she happens to be single.
She insisted.
She show me around town all you know,

594
00:35:28.171 --> 00:35:32.490
all the touristy shit.
So we exchanged numbers.
Donna,

595
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.690
later that day when I got back to my hotel,

596
00:35:36.691 --> 00:35:41.100
we texting bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp now we no big deal.

597
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:45.930
Just catch up now.
Just catching up.
Okay.
Hi,
you're Ben.
How's the family?

598
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:49.050
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Then we start talking on the phone.
All right,

599
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.700
and pretty soon get Dick's up.

600
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.090
I thought what she had for me in high school was ancient history,
but no,

601
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:59.091
the conversation soon took a turn and got romantic and he writes Joe g's.

602
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.690
So we made plans to meet for the next day for lunch the next day,

603
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.830
hanging out with my buddy.

604
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:08.220
I casually brought up if he would have a problem with me dating his sister,

605
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:12.240
he insisted he had no problem with it.
Ah,
you know what,
dude?

606
00:36:12.241 --> 00:36:16.240
I thought you were a piece of shit.
There you go.
All right.
You're

607
00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.010
such a weird thing.
I could never ask for freedom.

608
00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:23.610
You might invite date your sister.
You mean what you mind if I,
if you're,

609
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.230
if you fuck my sister.
Yeah,
I do.
You better marry or you showed of a pitch.

610
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:33.750
So he's like,
okay,
great.
So I take her to lunch,
we do all the touristy stuff.

611
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:37.170
Then I took her back to her place while in the parking lot at her place.

612
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.400
She is getting out of my car and I go to give her a hug.
Good night.

613
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.550
This is when the hug turned into,
into a kiss.
Uh,

614
00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:49.290
she got back in my car and we made out really hardcore bill.

615
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.400
I was surprised at how aggressive she was being all nerdy as she was.

616
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.410
Why do people think nerdy women don't have needs to,
you know,

617
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:02.790
they just a little introverted.
Well,
you got to do is give them the green light,

618
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:08.430
you know,
open the fucking door.
Um,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

619
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.080
What the hell was it?
I was surprised at how aggressive she was.
She asked,
um,

620
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.960
I was surprised how aggressive she was being all nerdy she was,

621
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:20.370
but there was something oddly sexy about it.
Uh,
she asked to,

622
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:25.620
to ditch her place and go back to my hotel.
Oh fuck.
Jesus Christ,
Dude.
Jesus.

623
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:30.000
So I say,
okay,
cool.
On the way there.
I started having second thoughts.

624
00:37:30.001 --> 00:37:34.650
I thought things might be moving too fast.
I know,
I know.
What a pussy.
No,
dude,

625
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.600
it's actually a benefit for you fucking

626
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:38.300
<v 0>yeah,</v>

627
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.850
<v 1>to mature choice there.
If you've got other women that you just banging this,</v>

628
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:47.740
this is not somebody you can just discard this.
Use your friends
sister.

629
00:37:47.741 --> 00:37:50.740
He got to run into her again.
You got to go easy on this one.

630
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:55.060
It's a fucking ticking time bomb.
So anyways,
we got back to my room.

631
00:37:55.061 --> 00:37:59.470
Nothing happened.
I cooled it off intentionally.
We had a few drinks,
talked,

632
00:37:59.471 --> 00:38:02.050
joked around while she's laid on my bed.

633
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.760
This is what I noticed that she laughed exactly like my buddy,
her brother.

634
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:11.350
Oh No.
The more she laughed,
the more it's bothering me.

635
00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.440
Needless to say,
that was the end of the night.

636
00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.360
I'll make out session and a few drinks and some laughs.
So here's my question,

637
00:38:19.361 --> 00:38:24.010
Bill.
I think this girl is perfect for me.
She's smart,
educated,

638
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.860
gorgeous girl.
But how can I get over that laugh?

639
00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:31.750
All I could do was picture her brother and nothing kills the mood more than
that.

640
00:38:31.751 --> 00:38:32.560
For me.

641
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.560
Am I being a dick for thinking about passing up this or is there something here?

642
00:38:36.561 --> 00:38:40.050
Bill,
thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

643
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.200
I don't know if there's something there you got to tell me,

644
00:38:43.201 --> 00:38:46.680
but as far as I as an outsider looking in,
yeah,
you can't be with that girl.

645
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.350
You can end up fucking your friends

646
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:58.220
joking.
Um,
no,
I know what Jimmy,

647
00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.200
I remember there was a buddy of mine

648
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:06.500
I had and his sister looked exactly like him with long hair.

649
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.031
I mean it was like,

650
00:39:09.031 --> 00:39:12.330
it was uncanny how much they look like each other and you know,

651
00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:18.840
she was a nice person.
Everything.
But it was,
it was my friend in drag

652
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:21.311
and you know,

653
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:25.600
so much of a relationship keeping it going is if he can make each other laugh

654
00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:27.640
and if every time she fucking laughs

655
00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.160
you got to break up with one on one of the two.
I don't know.

656
00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.400
You break up with you.
You can't be friends with him anymore.

657
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.930
He's got to be with her long enough that,
that laugh.
It becomes her laugh.

658
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

659
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.110
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

660
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.780
Do you know what it really comes down to is how freaked out you are by it.

661
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:48.970
You know,
I mean,
every guy's had this,

662
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.060
you meet a girl in the bar and you're attracted to her and then she has the same

663
00:39:52.061 --> 00:39:54.010
name as your mother.
It's like over,

664
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.900
over silver done deal.
Can't do it.

665
00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.850
Can't tell you.
Get tell you.
See you later sweetheart.

666
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:05.770
Feel it.

667
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.980
You are trapped yet trampling on sacred ground.
This sweetheart,
get it.

668
00:40:11.981 --> 00:40:15.340
What's your middle name?
Because I want to address you by your name.

669
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:19.980
When I say to get the fuck out of my face,
uh,
I dunno what you do there buddy.

670
00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:22.080
I mean,
if you actually feel like this,

671
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.390
there's something there beyond the fact that you want to just banger,

672
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.680
which I don't think you have a problem finding a women to bag.

673
00:40:30.681 --> 00:40:33.830
So maybe you do think of something about her.
I Dunno.
Uh,

674
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.180
that's going to be your Dell would have to be your choice.
Um,

675
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.150
just personally,
personally speaking,
I don't know if I met,

676
00:40:44.151 --> 00:40:48.380
the girl did,
I thought was,
you know,
the one I'm supposed to be with.

677
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:50.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

678
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.050
<v 1>And she laughed like my best friend of,</v>

679
00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.770
Oh my God,
there's 7 billion people on the planet.
You can't find them.

680
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:01.960
Some woman to fuck that doesn't laugh like your friend.

681
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.140
Oh Geez.
You know,
I'm not good at advice today.
That even sounded ignorant to me.

682
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

683
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:15.130
<v 1>Could hear all the fucking women got so fucking stupid.
Um,</v>

684
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.020
all right,
let's go back to this one.
Dear Billy,

685
00:41:18.021 --> 00:41:21.430
because stands or recently I was in Boston for work and I decided to visit a

686
00:41:21.431 --> 00:41:23.740
good of,
oh wait a minute.
What the fuck is this?

687
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.220
Oh,
wait a minute.
Okay.
Oh,
I copied and pasted it.
I'm a dummy.
All right.

688
00:41:31.221 --> 00:41:32.870
Threats on your comedy,
Dear Bill.

689
00:41:32.871 --> 00:41:37.670
If Jon il or the dictator of any country had a problem with your comedy and

690
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:41.240
strongly suggested or threatened you to never do a particular bit again,

691
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:45.980
would you stop doing that bit?
Um,
not in the United States.

692
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.200
I wouldn't,
not in Canada.
Not In an allied country.
But you know,

693
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:58.000
if I went over to Asia I would be,
I'd be a little lower.
I don't know if I would,

694
00:41:58.001 --> 00:42:02.840
even if I was in China as far as I know,
they get along with Korea pretty well,

695
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.453
don't they?

696
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.560
So they're not really looking at any shifty Korean type of dude coming into
Thai.

697
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.170
I would be a little bit nervous.
I mean fucking that guy like feeds,

698
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:16.670
he fed his uncle till to wild dogs

699
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.550
that was like naked and just watched him fucking,
you know,

700
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:25.470
basically mall the guy to death and then eat them.
Yeah,

701
00:42:25.471 --> 00:42:30.420
I would definitely be fucking nervous.
Um,
what I stopped doing the bit,

702
00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.030
no,
I don't think I would stop doing the bit.
Uh,
but you know what,

703
00:42:37.031 --> 00:42:40.870
these dates I have coming up going to like Singapore and Hong Kong and Shit like

704
00:42:40.871 --> 00:42:44.350
that.
I would definitely be,
I would not do it in those countries.

705
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.653
You know

706
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.190
the fuck am I Chuck Norris was this Delta Force.
Yeah.
I don't give a fuck.

707
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:54.170
But I mean if you're basically saying,

708
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.600
I dunno,
I dunno why they did that.

709
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.120
I guess I understand it on one level because God forbid,

710
00:43:03.121 --> 00:43:06.510
what if some fucking copycat maniac actually went in and did something,

711
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:11.820
the amount of money that they would've got sued and who's getting who,

712
00:43:11.821 --> 00:43:16.140
they don't make the money that they make if they used to make in movies anymore

713
00:43:16.141 --> 00:43:19.650
because you guys all fucking steal them.
Um,

714
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.110
so I don't think that they could handle,
um,

715
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.000
putting out a fucking movie and then people get blown up or whatever gets shot

716
00:43:27.001 --> 00:43:30.450
up or some shit and then they have to pay all the,
uh,

717
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.410
all the relatives.
So I guess I understand it but it's um,

718
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.603
<v 0>yeah.</v>

719
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:42.540
<v 1>You know what's weird is if,
why do they make it public?</v>

720
00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.580
You know what I mean?

721
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.340
Like they shouldn't have made the wiki leaks or any of that shit.

722
00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:53.341
Like they shouldn't even cover it on the news cause I would have never known.

723
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.350
Like if they leaked them out,
I never would know.

724
00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.280
I never went,
I wouldn't have fucking night would had no idea.

725
00:44:00.281 --> 00:44:03.940
One reason why I knew is because other people told me and I ended the fucker

726
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.910
news.
Just go about your business.
Who gives a fuck.

727
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

728
00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.560
<v 1>So then the one,
they're making these stretch out.</v>

729
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.040
We're going to do this once they make the threat,
I guess.
Yeah,

730
00:44:15.041 --> 00:44:17.470
you can't back down or did that gives him power.

731
00:44:17.471 --> 00:44:19.060
So I guess I'd have to do the bit,

732
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:23.590
unless I'm over on this side of the world and I'm,
you know,
I'm not saying shit.

733
00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:24.923
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

734
00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.920
<v 1>You,
yeah.
Fucking get kidnapped.</v>

735
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:29.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

736
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.370
<v 1>Have them do,
God knows what.
You know I what they do to the dolphins over there.</v>

737
00:44:32.371 --> 00:44:36.390
What the fuck are they going to do on me?
Um,
all right.
Christmas baking day,

738
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.590
Billy doughboy.
Uh,
what's happening in the bird kitchen this year?

739
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:42.900
Will you be baking?
One of your famous breads are Pi's.

740
00:44:42.901 --> 00:44:45.750
Should we expect any pictures on Twitter of your creations?

741
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:49.800
I actually sent out a picture of the,
uh,
the pan seared,

742
00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.060
um,
uh,
pork chops.
Technically,

743
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:58.890
if you bake a bread,
your house becomes a gingerbread house.

744
00:44:58.891 --> 00:45:03.690
Hey,
no.
Oh,
JJ.

745
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.970
You know,
some of you guys are really funny and then other,
you guys,
you guys,

746
00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:09.211
right?

747
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:12.270
Like those jokes that used to see on the match game and everybody would fucking

748
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:17.090
laughed.
Like it was hilarious.
Charles Nelson Reilly,
um,

749
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:22.410
I gotta be honest with you.
Uh,
underrated.

750
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:27.200
Pan searing a piece of meat.
It's fucking incredible.

751
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.170
He pants here,
that fucker.
And then you bake baked bake it.

752
00:45:30.171 --> 00:45:32.090
The worse the way through.
When the oven,
you take it out,

753
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:36.500
give it a little butter bath.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I got another,

754
00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:40.310
a recipe for a,
uh,
had a pan sear a New York strip.

755
00:45:40.311 --> 00:45:43.580
And if you ever told me that I was going to put a fucking New York Strip

756
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.310
and a God damn pants
in spirit,
I would say,

757
00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:53.510
get the fuck away from me.
You're a communist.
I ain't what the fuck that means?

758
00:45:53.511 --> 00:45:55.190
But whatever.
I would say get the fuck away from me.

759
00:45:55.191 --> 00:45:59.450
But now after how unbelievable that pork chop tasted

760
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.930
juicy,
his God damn health.
Um,
I'm all about it.

761
00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:11.090
Uh,
during the Christmas break here,
I'm going to up my,
uh,
pan searing game here.

762
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.840
Um,
you know what's awesome is I went down to the local butcher,
right?

763
00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:18.220
We've got a great fucking butcher in our neighborhood.
And,
um,

764
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.200
I went over there and I put in the order for the fucking Rosebowl.

765
00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.410
I'm so God damn site this year we're doing

766
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.440
<v 0>yeah,</v>

767
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.350
<v 1>with doing some ribs.
We got the burgers.</v>

768
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:32.050
La Head's going to make the fucking omelets.
You know,
it's funny,

769
00:46:32.051 --> 00:46:34.420
I actually texted lol,
I had a picture of the,
uh,

770
00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:39.430
the pan seared pork chops that I had and I said that,
uh,

771
00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.820
I texted him cause he's like the fucking cook at the thing.

772
00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:46.840
And I said just to let you know,
your backup is taken some snaps during practice.

773
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.090
Like I'm breathing down his fucking neck.

774
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.360
I can never be a better cook than that guy.
That guy is fucking unbelievable.

775
00:46:52.361 --> 00:46:55.810
But um,
yeah,
I'm going to be making a pie this week.
Um,

776
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:59.890
I made some more pumpkin bread because it's a fucking joke to make now at this

777
00:46:59.891 --> 00:47:02.560
point.
I love it.
Made it for two more people and I just,

778
00:47:02.561 --> 00:47:07.561
I drive around La and I just dropping it off like a brick a weed and um,

779
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:10.600
yeah,
I like doing it.
In fact,
you know what?

780
00:47:10.601 --> 00:47:13.180
I might make a fucking pie today just for the fuck of it.

781
00:47:13.181 --> 00:47:14.200
Just cause I haven't made one.

782
00:47:14.201 --> 00:47:17.320
I didn't make one over Thanksgiving because a fucking construction was going on.

783
00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.230
I don't want to,
I don't want to forget how to make the fucking pie crust.

784
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.520
Now remember people who don't want to fully mix,
all right,

785
00:47:24.521 --> 00:47:26.860
whatever you're shortening and everything with the flour you want to get.

786
00:47:26.861 --> 00:47:30.330
It was just mixed where it's crumpled cause then you roll it out as your role in

787
00:47:30.331 --> 00:47:34.510
the fucking thing out in the crust.
That's when the rest of the mixing happens.

788
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:36.910
If you already have it fully mixed and then you roll it out,

789
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:40.190
you're gonna to have a tough crust and that's one to grow on.
All right,

790
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.610
Christmas gift dilemma.
Hey Yo,

791
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:48.420
Billy [inaudible],
Billy boy.
Oh boy.
Oh wait,

792
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.550
let me do the rest of the fucking advertising here real quick.
Oh,

793
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:54.580
go fuck yourself.
It's what we got to do.
A,
Hey,

794
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:57.580
if you want to donate to this podcast,
but not have to really give me any money,

795
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.860
uh,
next time you go to amazon.com,

796
00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:03.970
just go to [inaudible] dot com first click on the podcast page.

797
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:07.780
Click on the APP,
the Amazon link,
whatever the fuck it's called,

798
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.180
little avatar there.
It takes you right to Amazon.

799
00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:11.650
Everything's the exact same price.

800
00:48:11.651 --> 00:48:14.830
And then they kicked me a little bit of money for driving some traffic over that

801
00:48:14.831 --> 00:48:19.740
way.
No fucking skin off your fucking bulls.
The um,

802
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.610
all right,
eva [inaudible] everybody.

803
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.410
I love the flexibility that owning my own business provides.

804
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:30.190
Look at me.
I've created an empire with this show.

805
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.490
I love how they talk shift from he did Rex Ryan,
right?
This,

806
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.930
when it comes to handling,
handling business calls,
you're stuck with a challenge.

807
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.520
Either hire a full time receptionist that could potentially ruin your marriage

808
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:46.240
or handle all your calls yourself.
It's a lose lose.

809
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.160
That's why I love the voice.

810
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.750
They will set your business up with a toll free number or local number.

811
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.950
When customers call,
they're greeted by prospect,
greeted professionally.

812
00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.290
Hello Sir.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:08.740
There's even a dial by name directory.
You'll sound like a fortune 500 company,

815
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:09.700
and more importantly,

816
00:49:09.701 --> 00:49:12.910
you'll never miss an important call all for under 13 bucks a month.

817
00:49:12.911 --> 00:49:17.740
Right now for a limited time,
my listeners can try he voice for free for 60 days.

818
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.520

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:24.220

820
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:26.560

823
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.880
Now he voiced.com/bill that's he voiced.com/.

824
00:49:36.881 --> 00:49:40.420
Bill I love that there's even a dial by name directory.
That's funny.

825
00:49:40.421 --> 00:49:42.520
If it's just you and your business,

826
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:44.740
then you just make up a bunch of other people's fucking names.

827
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.180
You know it's the hardest thing to do when you write a script is other than the

828
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:52.200
third act is coming up with fake names.
They always sound fake,

829
00:49:52.201 --> 00:49:53.440
so you just start naming them people.

830
00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:56.830
You went to high school with characters and that type of shit.
All right,

831
00:49:56.831 --> 00:50:01.210
last thing here,
stamps.com everybody with the holidays almost here,

832
00:50:01.211 --> 00:50:04.570
you don't have time to go to the post office and even if you go,
you have,

833
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.170
you don't,
you don't want to go.
If you do have time to go there,

834
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:10.540
there's going to be traffic.
There's going to be lines out the damn door,

835
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:16.390
you know supplies all over the floor.
It's an absolute shit show.

836
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:19.220
It's going to be packed with everyone mailing their holiday gifts,
a package.

837
00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:20.190
She has packages.

838

You know what do what I do you stamps.com instead with stamps.com you can avoid

839
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:28.270
all the hassles,
man of going to the post office during the holiday season.

840
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.480
Everything you would do at the post office,
she could do right from your desk.

841
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.460
Why to help.
Would you go down there?

842
00:50:33.461 --> 00:50:36.700
Buy and print official US postage using your own computer and printer.

843
00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.390
You can print postage for any letter or package the instant you need it.

844
00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:44.350
Then the mailman picks it up.
It's a joke.
It's so easy and convenient.

845
00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:48.220
I use stamps.com to send out all my posters when I want to whore myself out and

At what point is this not going to be a special offer?

850
00:51:00.941 --> 00:51:02.560
It's been a special offer for three years,

851
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:07.600
$110 bonus offer that includes a digital scale and $55 free postage.

852
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.880
Call for action verbatim.
I got to make sure I say every word here.
Don't wait.

853
00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:17.710
Exclamation point.
Go to stamps.com comma,
before you do anything else,

857
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:33.500

All right.
What a Douche.
I am.
Um,

858
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.260
I want to tell you about the lady I saw yelling at that person in the seven 11.

859
00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.641
I don't what happened.

860
00:51:38.641 --> 00:51:41.910
I walked in and this fucking lady was yelling at the seven 11 guy.
Right.

861
00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:45.210
And I could tell by his energy he was right because he's just so,

862
00:51:45.211 --> 00:51:48.530
that's just sort of smile.
Yeah.
All right,
lady.
Ah,
right.
All right.

863
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:51.590
And she's fucking flipping out.
You don't touch me.

864
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.990
You don't pull that out of my hand.
He's like,
hi.

865
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.920
And she's getting towards the door and she's cursing them out and everything and

866
00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:02.830
he goes,
I have a nice night.
You have a nice night.
She just goes,
bullshit.

867
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.810
Bull Shit in your mouth.
Bullshit in your mouth.
You didn't mean that.

868
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:12.670
I never heard it said that way.
Bullshit in your mouth.

869
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.970
Um,
all right.
Christmas baking.
All right.
Did I answer that one yet?
Yeah,
I did.

870
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:21.930
Um,
Christmas.
You know what?
I want it.
I want to do a fucking prime rib,

871
00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.970
prime rib dinner.
Popovers it some other fucking bullshit,
some sort of grains.

872
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.660
Fucking throw that down with a giant goblet,
a wine,

873
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.530
and just start snoring in the corner.
Like I fucking accomplished something.

874
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.970
And that'd be a great way to do it.
Hey,
you know what's,
you know what's fucking,

875
00:52:39.971 --> 00:52:42.880
uh,

Huh?

876
00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:47.500
Can we have buddy be once in a while?

877
00:52:47.501 --> 00:52:49.670
You've got to pet your dog even though you're doing something else.
Come here.

878
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.670
What's going on?
Huh?
What's up buddy?

879
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:02.530
Go for a hike later.
Fuck.
Oh,
underrated.

880
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:07.540
Scratching your dog on its neck under the collar.

881
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:12.880
Not a people.
Forget this spot.
It's so funny.
Shit ever.
The second you do it,

882
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.410
they extend their face and they have a look of satisfaction in their eyes.

883
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.100
You wish you could as a human being experienced,
whatever the fuck it is.

884
00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:25.430
It their experience like

He's like,

885
00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:30.170

Alright,

886
00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:35.540

You,
um,
oh,
when I was done with the pork chop last night,

887
00:53:35.541 --> 00:53:38.210
I went out and rinse the thing off because my dog has a sensitive stomach.

888
00:53:38.211 --> 00:53:42.650
If there's any spices on it,
she fucking gets to get still runs.
But uh,

889
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:46.700
rinse the whole,
fuck.
Hey,

890
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.770
<v 0>okay,</v>

891
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:53.540
<v 1>back over there and lay down
before we go on.
All the doors are closed.</v>

892
00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:54.620
Get over there and lay down.

893
00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:57.243
<v 0>MMM.</v>

894
00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:01.300
<v 1>Rinsed off the bone.
It's actually my wife did it.
Why am I taking credits?</v>

895
00:54:01.301 --> 00:54:02.030
She's the one who did it.

896
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:04.580
I didn't have the balls to cause that's cause I take her for a walk and I have

897
00:54:04.581 --> 00:54:09.020
to clean up the fucking shit show.
Literally.
She's like,
no,
I'll,
I'll,

898
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:13.010
I'll wash it all off to the fucking joy

899
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.080
of a dog.
When you give it a fucking bone,
it's unbelievable.

900
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:22.910
Fucking throw it down.
They walk around it.
Tail Wagon.

901
00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.250
They just can't fucking believe that this,
so God damn.

902
00:54:25.251 --> 00:54:29.870
So I can get that gives the same can of dog food every goddamn night,

903
00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.000
every morning.
And it will sit down,

904
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:36.050
but it's just eating the same shit just to get that fucking break.

905
00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:42.120
Unbelievable.
All right.
Sorry.
Christmas gift dilemma.
Hey.
Oh Billy boy,

906
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.970
my fiancee.
And are big fans of your work.
Well thank you very much.

907
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:49.140
I am writing to ask you if you could tell him merry Christmas for me on your

908
00:54:49.141 --> 00:54:53.550
podcast.
I don't have a lot of money to get them anything this year.
No.

909
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.450
Are you the fucking couple from the Bon Jovi Song?
John?

910
00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:02.890
I used to work on the dog.
Yo,

911
00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:13.060
what the fuck was Bon Jovi sitting in the box with?

912
00:55:13.061 --> 00:55:17.050
Robert Kraft applauding a jets loss,
isn't he from New Jersey?

913
00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.880
We got a holdout.
Do what we got.

914
00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.070
I own arena football and it's not so great.

915
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:33.010
Maybe if I hang out with Bobby Craft,
I can buy the bills.

916
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.520
I'll give it a shot.
Sorry.
Um,

917
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.780
so you don't have a lot of money.
Okay.
I don't have any money,
uh,

918
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:45.020
to get them anything this year because I am working hard and trying to make a

919
00:55:45.021 --> 00:55:46.400
living in theater.

920
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:50.960
He's incredibly supportive of my career and does everything he can to help me

921
00:55:50.961 --> 00:55:51.771
and make me happy.

922
00:55:51.771 --> 00:55:55.430
This year I had been trying to think of something I could do that was special

923
00:55:55.431 --> 00:55:58.460
for him.
Uh,
this is where you come in.

924
00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:01.910
I was wondering if you could take a few seconds on the podcast to say merry

925
00:56:01.911 --> 00:56:06.600
fucking Christmas.
Yeah.
To drew from Marcy.

926
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.610
Oh,

I thought Marcy was the name of the town,
so fuck it.
Dope.

927
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.920
Marcy.
What?
Uh,

928
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.710
she loves you more than anything in the world and thinks everything.

929
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.510
Thanks you for everything you have done for her.
She can't wait.
All right,

930
00:56:22.511 --> 00:56:27.080
so yeah,
wait a minute.
She loves you.

931
00:56:27.081 --> 00:56:29.810
I thought this is from,
this is from a dude.

932
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.150
Merry Christmas to drew from Marcy.

933
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.880
I'm all fucking turned around here.

934
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:44.350
He is incredibly,
so much.
So you wrote,
he loves you.

935
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:49.390
She loves you.
Now he loves me,
right?
I'm just going to say,
well you said,

936
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:54.480

That's a,
I dunno,

I hope your books up.

938
00:56:58.811 --> 00:57:00.670
Then a bunch of jobs and he become famous.

939
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:03.490
Say now you have your own podcast and everything works out for you and stick

940
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:07.960
with Marcy.
She seems like a wonderful woman.
There you go.

You're fucking hot.

Tweeting and Facebooking and talking about my special,

945
00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:26.890
is unbelievable the amount of new fans that I've gotten and all that type of

946
00:57:26.891 --> 00:57:30.100
shit.
So I do not take that for granted.

947
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:33.340
thank you to everybody who's been doing that.
I really appreciate it.

948
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:38.710
Um,

957
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.970
and I,
I really think that this show is going a little rex Ryan.
Yeah.

958
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.750
I think if we fucking,
if we don't drop the ball,

959
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.980
this thing is going to be fucking hilarious.
Um,

960
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.650
yeah,
it's been,
uh,
it's been fucking ridiculous.
I fuck,
I got to wait a year.

961
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:21.220
It's fucking brutal.
Okay.
I wish it was coming up tomorrow.
Anyway.
Secondly,

962
00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:23.110
congrats on the helicopter training.

963
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:27.280
I had a suspicion you were doing some kind of training or something because

964
00:58:27.281 --> 00:58:29.860
every time I hear you talk about the atmosphere and Shit,

965
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:32.740
you've started sounding less and less like an idiot.

966
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.540
That was my favorite part of ground school was the weather.
Uh,

967
00:58:37.541 --> 00:58:39.760
what is your favorite thing about flying?

968
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:44.500
And you need to cross over to the dark side and get your fixed wing certificate

969
00:58:44.501 --> 00:58:48.160
for all you other people out there.
That's means to just fly in an airplane.

970
00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:52.090
That's fixed.
Wing is in the wing is fixed as opposed to a helicopter.

971
00:58:52.091 --> 00:58:53.950
We're just spinning around.
Okay.
And he goes,

972
00:58:53.951 --> 00:58:57.310
I fly private jets and I'm a flight instructor out here in La.

973
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:02.380
Let's get you and your wife in something you guys can travel.
And Dude,

974
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:05.350
I love the fact that you think that I could ever afford something like that.

975
00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:08.740
Those things are like fucking a zillion dollars.
Um,

976
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:12.070
now with your ADHD and your Dick's Dyslexia,

977
00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:15.900
I'm sure you've botched reading this email.
So go fuck yourself.
Um,

978
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:22.660
that's a,
I don't know,
man.
I would
flying a jet.

979
00:59:22.661 --> 00:59:27.580
That's got to be fucking unbelievable.
Um,
what do I like most about flying?
Um,

980
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:34.430
I'll tell you yesterday was the first day I actually felt like one with the

981
00:59:34.431 --> 00:59:36.590
machine.
Like I actually,
you know,

982
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.580
it's kind of like when you have to stop thinking about driving and he could just

983
00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:43.010
sort of feel the car,
you know,

984
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:45.560
you've just done it enough that you've just sort of fucking,

985
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:48.050
it's like you're sharing the same brain.
I finally,

986
00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:52.730
I hadn't flown in a minute cause I was all busy and um,

987
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.410
but I was thinking about it a lot.
As crazy as that sounds.

988
00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:02.630
I was thinking about different scenarios and then the inputs,
you know,
and uh,

989
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.480
<v 0>okay.</v>

990
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.330
<v 1>I flew great.
I and my favorite,
you don't,</v>

991
01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:10.060
my favorite fucking part about flying a helicopter is a auto rotations.

992
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:13.810
Um,
and when I get my license,

993
01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:16.870
I'm taking the advanced autorotation class.

994
01:00:16.871 --> 01:00:18.640
We got to take it all the way down to the ground.

995
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.080
And for those of you people don't know,

996
01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:23.200
that's like if you had an engine failure and like many people,

997
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:27.550
I also felt that if the engine failed on a helicopter,

998
01:00:27.551 --> 01:00:30.400
you were fucked and you just fell out of the sky.
You don't,

999
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.750
it's actually safer I think anyways.

1000
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:38.840
Then fixed wing because of the,
uh,
how,
how,

1001
01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:40.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

1002
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.820
<v 1>Basically what the fixed wing,
you know,
you have to,</v>

1003
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.680
how fast you still have to be going when you land,
you know,

1004
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:51.920
and if you're not on a fucking road and it's a God damn field in this tree

1005
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:54.920
stumps there and shit,
that's why so many of those fucking fixed wing guys,

1006
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:58.850
they get it on the fucking ground and they still die when they hit a fucking

1007
01:00:58.851 --> 01:01:02.360
tree because that thing is not designed to hit anything.

1008
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:06.920
It's designed to fly.
It's all weight and balance.
So you're basically,

1009
01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:10.790
you're in a fucking golf cart and you fucking hit a tree.

1010
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:15.300
It's 60 knots or whatever the fuck you gotta be flying.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1011
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.930
I don't know anything about fixing me.
How fast do you have to be going to still,

1012
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.600
you know,
maintain lift or whatever.
But it's terrifying.
Whereas a helicopter,

1013
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:28.310
um,
all right.
Really quickly,
and I'm going to sound like a moron.
I know.

1014
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:32.640
So basically,
you know when you watch like a Rambo movie and they shoot out the,

1015
01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:36.950
the tail rotor and then the fucking helicopter starts spinning around.

1016
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.361
Okay.

1017
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:43.220
And then they fuck basically if you roll off the throttle,

1018
01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:48.830
okay.
The engine is no longer turning the main rotor,

1019
01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.430
which turning the main rotor is your,

1020
01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.820
your descent back down to the earth in the fucking air,

1021
01:01:53.821 --> 01:01:57.420
rushing up through the rotor,
the main road.
Okay.

1022
01:01:57.421 --> 01:01:59.040
You no longer need the tail rotor.

1023
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:03.360
The tail rotor basically compensates for the fucking,
uh,
like if,

1024
01:02:03.361 --> 01:02:07.290
if your main rotor turns counter clockwise,
counterclockwise,

1025
01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:09.600
it wants to turn the ship clockwise.

1026
01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.710
So that's why you have the tail rotor on the back,
on site.

1027
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:17.130
It's compensating for that torque so you can keep the fucking thing straight.

1028
01:02:17.131 --> 01:02:19.610
So you don't just spin around like a fucking top basically.

1029
01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.790
And if you see a helicopter that has two main rotors,

1030
01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.090
basically I guess it would be both like both giant rotors.

1031
01:02:26.091 --> 01:02:28.520
The reason why they don't need a tail rotors cause one turns clockwise.

1032
01:02:28.521 --> 01:02:30.020
The other one turns counter clockwise.

1033
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:35.330
Both offsetting the torque and it keeps it fucking straight.
So basically if,

1034
01:02:35.331 --> 01:02:38.840
God forbid
you had an engine failure,

1035
01:02:38.841 --> 01:02:43.841
all you do is you roll off the throttle and the thing that I fly is you want to

1036
01:02:44.121 --> 01:02:47.450
be going about 65 knots and that's the speed you want to keep it at.

1037
01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.090
And as your rpms come up,
you catch him,
you pull up power,

1038
01:02:50.091 --> 01:02:51.290
which is the weirdest fucking thing.

1039
01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:52.730
Cause he think if he didn't want it to go up,

1040
01:02:52.731 --> 01:02:56.420
you push it down but you actually pull it up and you just fucking

1041
01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.410
just like that.
You fucking glide all the way down.

1042
01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:04.010
You pick it and you don't trim airspeed,
Rpm,
trim,
airspeed,
Rpm,

1043
01:03:04.011 --> 01:03:05.780
trim years doing that.
And then as the grounds coming out,

1044
01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:09.740
you know you're picking your spot is the ground comes up gentle aft cyclic.

1045
01:03:09.741 --> 01:03:10.910
You go into a flare,

1046
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.960
you basically stopping the air,

1047
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:20.030
push the cyclic forward and then you level okay.
And at that point,

1048
01:03:20.031 --> 01:03:24.500
and then you just drop 40 feet and you just drop to the ground and it right

1049
01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:27.080
about 10 feet off the deck,
you pull the power,

1050
01:03:27.081 --> 01:03:30.800
which is like pulling up the emergency brake and that last little bit of power

1051
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.380
slows you down.
You drop like a fucking daisy.

1052
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:39.410
Now I don't know how to do that yet.
I can do it all the way down to the flare.

1053
01:03:39.411 --> 01:03:41.420
And that's my favorite fucking thing to do.

1054
01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.190
And I've thought about that a zillion times on my couch.

1055
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.730
Literally reenacting it and thinking it.
And believe it or not,

1056
01:03:49.731 --> 01:03:53.150
it actually helps you because I hadn't flown since November 5th and I went out

1057
01:03:53.151 --> 01:03:57.380
and we did some autos and I had two of the best ones I ever did.

1058
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.930
I forgot to look at the RPM cause I was so psyched that I was in trim and that I

1059
01:04:02.931 --> 01:04:07.340
was at 65 knots and I was falling.
You know,
at though at the descending,

1060
01:04:07.341 --> 01:04:09.550
I should say at the right rate of speed.
And,
uh,

1061
01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:12.680
that's my favorite thing because it's all about what the fuck am I.

1062
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:18.110
I just want to have those things so down that I can actually enjoy flying

1063
01:04:18.111 --> 01:04:22.400
around.
So I would say that that was the most,
most fun.

1064
01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:27.020
And another time I took out an our 44,
which is the four passenger,

1065
01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:28.040
and I flew up,

1066
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:33.020
<v 5>uh,
up the coast,</v>

1067
01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:34.830
um,

1068
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.660
<v 1>right by lax out by the water.</v>

1069
01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:41.400
And you got to be 150 feet off the ocean as you go through Bravo airspace and

1070
01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:44.310
you're looking at lax where you took off from a Zillion fucking times.

1071
01:04:44.311 --> 01:04:48.830
It's just a different view.
And then you come back up on the other side.

1072
01:04:48.831 --> 01:04:52.850
And I made a right at the fucking,
what the hell was it?
The,
uh,

1073
01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.320
the Ferris wheel there.
It's Santa Monica.
Then I flew right up,

1074
01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.780
but just followed Santa Monica like you driving down the road,

1075
01:04:59.781 --> 01:05:03.920
except you're in the air.
Went over all the houses in Beverly Hills.

1076
01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:08.090
Just kept going and going and going until I got out to fucking,
you know,

1077
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:11.150
over where I live.
Flew over my fucking house,

1078
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.300
little around some more out to the valley.

1079
01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:17.490
Then I flew over fucking dodger stadium.
So the next time I do that flight,

1080
01:05:17.491 --> 01:05:20.190
I'm going to fly over fucking dodger stadium and then over the rose bowl.

1081
01:05:20.191 --> 01:05:23.950
That's what I want to do.
And um,
I dunno,

1082
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:26.770
I dunno about fixed wing.
I like fixed wing is fixed wing.

1083
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:30.400
Seems like if you want to go,
if I wanted to start flying myself to my gigs,

1084
01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:33.100
which I don't,
cause I'm not gonna make any money,

1085
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:36.550
the amount of money off to spend the fucking rent the plane in the jet fuel and

1086
01:05:36.551 --> 01:05:40.180
all of that fucking shit.
I don't want to do that.
But,
um,

1087
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:44.380
what I like most about flying a helicopter is it's a,

1088
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:47.980
it's truly like flying where you can just,
you can stop in the middle of the air,

1089
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:50.920
like a fucking hummingbird.
And he'd go out over the ocean,

1090
01:05:50.921 --> 01:05:54.400
you see porpoises and shit that looks like a fucking giant shark and they need

1091
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:56.830
to see a God Damn Bunch of people surfing.

1092
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.900
And you sit there from that bird's eye view gone.
Yeah.

1093
01:05:58.901 --> 01:06:02.170
That right there is why I don't go in the fucking ocean.
Look at that thing.

1094
01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:06.400
What the fuck is that thing?
Swimming by itself.

1095
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.790
Sharks are loners
anyways.
Um,

1096
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:13.540
<v 0>okay.</v>

1097
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.720
<v 1>Yeah,
I would say I could,
I could go on and on forever.
Um,</v>

1098
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:21.370
I would like eventually to a,
who's kidding,
who?

1099
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.480
I'd like to have that fucking helicopter that the guy had a magnum Pi.

1100
01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:29.050
I would eventually love to have that.
In fact,
the next time I go to Hawaii,

1101
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:33.300
there's a helicopter tour that they take you up in one of those 500 where the

1102
01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:34.134
fuck the thing is,

1103
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.520
they got a painted just like that and they'll take you over the fucking

1104
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:41.500
volcanoes and waterfalls and all that and I'm dying to do that shit.
Um,

1105
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.750
but uh,
yeah,
I don't know.

1106
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.930
I thought I was too dumb to get through fucking ground school.

1107
01:06:46.931 --> 01:06:48.730
I still have to take the test and all that shit.

1108
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:53.050
That's what it would be knocking out here before I go to Australia.
And um,

1109
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.730
and then the second I get licensed,

1110
01:06:54.731 --> 01:06:57.430
I'm immediately going to take the advanced autorotation class where I have to

1111
01:06:58.510 --> 01:07:00.940
take it all the way to the flare and take it all the way down to the fucking

1112
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:01.181
ground,

1113
01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:03.490
which they basically don't let you do cause they don't want you to beaten the

1114
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:08.320
shit out of the helicopters.
Um,
maybe surprised with those skids can take,

1115
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.920
especially with some of the fucking landings I've had,

1116
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:12.970
I might as well talk about this shit.

1117
01:07:12.971 --> 01:07:17.010
One of the most fucked up things ever is the first time when they let you do

1118
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:21.460
your solo,
just basically fly the traffic pattern around the airport.
You know,

1119
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.070
I think if you're a sane person,
you never think you're ready to do that.

1120
01:07:26.071 --> 01:07:29.790
But they kind of know when you're ready and then they just have you set the

1121
01:07:29.791 --> 01:07:33.180
thing down and they go,
all right,
I'm stepping out,
fly the fucking pattern.

1122
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:36.210
And you sit there and act like,
Hey,
I got this shit.

1123
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.120
And then you fly it and you can't believe what you know.

1124
01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.150
Like the second time I did it,

1125
01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:46.800
a fucking jet blue plane was landing and I had to hold over this building,

1126
01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:48.483
this hangar.

1127
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:54.200
They called me out my fucking tail number and told me to hold and I did it.

1128
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.760
I was like a,
it was weird.
It was really weird.
Like,
Oh,

1129
01:07:59.761 --> 01:08:02.280
I actually know how to do that.
I mean,
I knew I knew how to do that,

1130
01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:03.340
but I didn't know how.
I knew.
I knew.

1131
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:07.350
I didn't know that I knew how to do that by myself.
And that's by the way,

1132
01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:10.170
what I call soloing flying by myself.

1133
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:19.120
So anyways,
um,
what do I enjoy about it?
All of it.
I love that as much.

1134
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.470
It's as much fun as playing drums and doing standup.

1135
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:25.220
It's just another fun thing to do and yeah.

1136
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:26.040
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1137
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.900
<v 1>If you got the fucking time to do it,
why wouldn't you go do it?
So I did.
It was,</v>

1138
01:08:30.901 --> 01:08:32.170
uh,
something,
uh,

1139
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:36.900
that kind of came about through freaking out about living in La and being in

1140
01:08:36.901 --> 01:08:41.860
conspiracy theory.
And then I did that bit about the,
um,

1141
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:48.020
you know,
that guy commit suicide,
jumping out of the helicopter.
And,
uh,

1142
01:08:48.021 --> 01:08:50.390
I was already into helicopters,
but I,
I really,

1143
01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:54.590
it was one of those things in my head.
I just said that I,
I,
I couldn't do it.

1144
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.200
Like,
I,
I couldn't give her get to ground school.
I couldn't,
I mean,

1145
01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.890
I actually really enjoyed it.
Um,
some of it,
some of that shit,

1146
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.490
you know what the Shit I fucking hate.
I hate all that fucking

1147
01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.450
and all that fucking radio stuff and the fucking,
you know,

1148
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:12.590
who do you contact if this happens and all that shit.
You basically need to know.

1149
01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:16.780
I find that stuff really teethies these,
but learning about weather and,
uh,

1150
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.390
the markings,
all that shit around the airport was fucking interesting.

1151
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:25.550
How the fucking thing flies actually the understand that now.
Um,

1152
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.200
it's pretty,
uh,
it's pretty amazing.
And you guys remember me,
I mean,

1153
01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:32.300
a fucking year ago,
I didn't understand how a plane flew.
So,
uh,

1154
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:34.603
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1155
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.050
<v 1>Do you think you can't do something?
Be fucking surprise.</v>

1156
01:09:37.051 --> 01:09:40.050
So they got this kind of uplifting,
isn't it?
I hope it is.
Um,
anyways,

1157
01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.490
another year's gone by everybody.

1158
01:09:41.491 --> 01:09:44.370
Thank you for everyone who's come up to my show.
Anybody who was hyped,

1159
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.980
anything that I'm doing.
Uh,

1160
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:52.080
I got some shit for your fucking ass next year.
I'm telling you,
telling you.

1161
01:09:52.081 --> 01:09:56.880
I just made up pilot that I think of Mike go could be a funny fucking show.

1162
01:09:56.881 --> 01:09:58.290
I'm working on my new hour.

1163
01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:04.550
I got a sick ass fucking tour coming up at the south and I'm thinking of maybe

1164
01:10:05.221 --> 01:10:07.860
doing another red state tour and then hitting all the other ones.

1165
01:10:07.861 --> 01:10:12.060
I got to fucking,
I'm going to do some dates in Boston,

1166
01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:14.400
my hometown.
I haven't been there in a minute.

1167
01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.670
Good couple of years actually come in February.

1168
01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:18.690
I haven't been there in a couple of years,

1169
01:10:18.691 --> 01:10:20.220
so it's gotta be a big year for me next year.

1170
01:10:20.221 --> 01:10:24.270
And then of course I got F is for family coming out if the end of the Goddamn

1171
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:26.820
year and it's kills me every week that I can't tell you anything more about it,

1172
01:10:26.821 --> 01:10:29.880
but I don't want to ruin it for you.
It's going to be a fucking monster,
I feel.

1173
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:34.800
Who knows?
Who knows?
That's it.
Everybody have a merry Christmas,

1174
01:10:34.801 --> 01:10:39.650
happy Hanukkah,
Kwanzaa,
whatever the fuck it is you do.
God bless.
Shift.

1175

They'll fuck yourselves.
