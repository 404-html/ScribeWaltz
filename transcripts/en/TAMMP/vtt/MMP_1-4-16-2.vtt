00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.850
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.120
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.160
January 4th,
2016 a brand new year.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.271
Brand New Year.

5
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:16.800
Brand new you or you couldn't make the changes since you've always wanted to

6
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.730
make,
where are you going to stop telling yourself you're going to change?

7
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:23.890
It actually got their change.

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.230
I always loved the pressure at the beginning of the new year it'd be like,
ah,

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.420
you know this,
that one great thing,
right?
Like what you're,
you're like,

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.800
it's shaken off the last year.
You know?
Like,

11
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.940
I don't know who the fuck that guy was.
Right.

12
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.550
Like lying these self like you're not the same person fucking one minute later

13
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:46.630
when it becomes a new year or you do the real childish thing as you blame

14
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.090
everybody else for your own fucking problems.
You know,

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.940
can't wait for this year to be over men.

16
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.490
She spent so much fucking bullshit to share.

17
00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.150
It's been like the worst fucking year.
I can't wait for the next fucking year.

18
00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:00.070
It's like,
dude,
what are you going to change?
Anything.

19
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.720
You're going to break up with the person.

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
Are you going to stop getting drunk and being a Dick and picking fights in a
bar,

21
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:09.340
right.
Ah,
all of that shit.
Oh,

22
00:01:09.341 --> 00:01:13.300
you just gotta think that magically because this is six there now instead of a

23
00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:17.620
five,
that all of a sudden the world's going to change.
You don't have to adjust.

24
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.540
Oh,
am I reprimanding somebody right now?
I think I am.
I don't know why.

25
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.460
I have no idea why I'm recording this.
Uh,
about eight 30 in the morning,

26
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.390
last Congolese time,
my wife's still sleeping downstairs,

27
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.330
so I gotta I gotta try to stay at medium energy.

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.090
<v 1>Medium energy here,
um,
for the rest of this fucking podcast.
Um,</v>

30
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.730
<v 0>okay.</v>

31
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.740
<v 1>But whatever,
I'm kind of,
I gotta be honest with you.</v>

32
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.290
I went to bed last night and I was sad.

33
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.670
I love the holidays and I'm sad that they're fucking over.
I had another great,

34
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.930
you know,

35
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.250
holiday break and to think that it's all going to fucking start over again.

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.100
You know,
here we go.

37
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.340
<v 1>Another fucking year doing the road right and shit and do it.</v>

39
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.640
All this stuff here we fucking go again.

40
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.850
The whole thing just got just totally overwhelming with me and I was just

41
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.740
fucking laying in bed,
you know?

42
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.860
And you know when you do fucking look too far ahead into your fucking life,
um,

43
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.830
<v 0>okay.</v>

44
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.600
<v 1>You know,
it just gets too fucking overwhelming.</v>

45
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.100
And then maybe you start here in the same that,

46
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:28.100
you know what song I always hear in my head,
I would say that's that song.

47
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.250
Make the world go away.

48
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.770
Sub Did sub data,
get it off my shoulders.

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.030
Um,
that's what I feel like the most pathetic emotion you could have.

50
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.550
Make the world go away and you just get to go in there and just pout,

51
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.693
you know?

52
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

53
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.740
<v 1>I gotta ask a question about depression.</v>

54
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.280
Is it actually a chemical thing or is that just an adult world word?

55
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

56
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.800
<v 1>For like somebody who's just kind of sorta pounding,
you know,</v>

57
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.100
I think a lot of times when people go,
I'm depressed,
it's just you,

58
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.900
you're just kind of feeling sorry for yourself.

59
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.560
And you know the ones that say it's like a chemical imbalance.

60
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.530
He just like you just shift your head really quickly.

61
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.340
The chemicals go back the other way and you'll cheer up.
You know,

62
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.910
don't believe the mainstream media,
you know,

63
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.580
in all the pharmaceutical companies with their drugs,
man.

64
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.670
Is there anything funnier that would somebody who's not a fucking doctor,

65
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.260
you know,
just starts going on and on about it.

66
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.840
You want me to tell you something man,
I'm telling you.

67
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:42.430
All you gotta do is just go up,
walk up to an oak tree,
can't be a parched,

68
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:46.520
can't be a maple.
Go Up to an oak tree and just bite on the little sapling.

69
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.260
He just not right.
You got a little piece of bark and you stick it between,

70
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.630
you just like chew you just stick it between your ego and all of that and you

71
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:57.940
depression will go away.
Yeah,
it is true.
It is true.

72
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.420
The native American choose to do it and they were never depressed.

73
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.770
That's what they used to do until the white man came and took the bark away.

74
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.140
Now look at them all grumpy.
Just like the white man cause they,

75
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.490
cause they couldn't get any more saplings with the tree bark there.
Um,

76
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.650
anyways,
uh,

77
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.270
first he and his wife left yesterday so the house is empty again.

78
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.960
It just stinks man.
I was having a great fucking time and join it.
Now it's going,

79
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.230
I off fucking starts over again.
Um,

80
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.690
Marie starting a year off my office is a fucking mess,
you know,

81
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.370
and I'm the worst.
I can't find the sticker to put on my fucking license plate.

82
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.480
I know.
I got it.
I don't know where the fuck it is.
It just,

83
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:47.350
it all starts over again.
Just fun.
Time's over.
Fun Time is over.

84
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.011
And you know what?

85
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:52.750
We still got the Christmas tree up because Nia liked it extra a lot this year.

86
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:57.310
So I still have to,
I still have to go through that sad fucking operation,

87
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.250
bringing that God damn thing outside.

88
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:02.830
And I told you I disposed that thing like a fucking mob hit.

89
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.450
You're never going to find the body.

90
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.510
But fucking neighbor already through his right out on the street,

91
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.610
just tosses it out there.
Right.
Some dead hooker.
You know what I mean?

92
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.540
Cut The fucking thing up and you put it in the barrel.
That's what you do.

93
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.570
I get my and my,
the green barrel,
right?

94
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.720
We got the green barrels out here and that's just like grass clippings and all

95
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:23.410
that shit.

96
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.650
I have a whole fucking Christmas tree and then the lid closes completely.

97
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.880
You'd have no fucking idea.
I mean come on people.
How difficult is it?

98
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.260
Get cut all the branches off.

99
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.880
They need just left with the trunk and then he just section it up that says drop

100
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:39.520
the thing.
Right.
The fuck in there.
It's not a problem.

101
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.090
What you safety goggles,
you know,

102
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:45.190
so nobody can see you cry and as you're doing it,

103
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.490
I don't understand what the fucking problem is.
The God damn it.

104
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:53.350
Get out there or dispose of the fucking tree correctly.
Um,

105
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:54.161
environmentally,

106
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.860
wouldn't it be more correct if you just sort of spread it across your,

107
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.180
the tree is just going to end up in a landfill or even worse out in the ocean.

108
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.200
They don't block at the,
Oh shit.
Um,

109
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.480
I can't wait to get to this fucking thing later on in this podcast with this
guy.

110
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:09.310
He's trying to claim that the,
uh,

111
00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:13.780
the earth can sustain 100 billion people.
I really cannot see.

112
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.760
I cannot wait to,
I just glanced at it and looked at it then.
It's just,
I,

113
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.020
I just how the fuck you,
you will arrive at that number.

114
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.330
And I actually tried to find shit.

115
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:30.240
I started looking up how many fucking people the Earth can sustain.
And uh,

116
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.670
what I immediately found was that nobody could say for certain,

117
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.710
but the numbers estimated we're nowhere near a hundred million fucking people.

118
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.060
I had a billion.
Sorry.

119
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:45.061
So I cannot wait to read this guy somehow claiming that there's enough farmland.

120
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.480
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

121
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.220
<v 1>To feed a hundred fucking</v>

122
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.040
<v 2>okay.</v>

123
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.780
<v 1>Billion people,
I don't know.
Okay.
Do we stack each other on top of one another?</v>

124
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.500
And even then,
do elephants get to roam free anymore?

125
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.330
Where are all the fucking animals?
Um,

126
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.240
if there was 100 billion people on the planet,

127
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.830
I would think that cannibalism would slowly start to become legal.

128
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.910
They would have a Beta of foreign people or stock people,

129
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:18.670
that's what they call them.
And they would be simply be

130
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.210
used for food,
you know?

131
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.570
<v 1>We just,
you know,
and of course it would be,
uh,
you know,</v>

133
00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:32.160
the evil white man would decide who it is that gets eaten first.
You know,
baby,

134
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:34.980
they'd start with like the pygmies or something like that because it'd be like,

135
00:07:34.981 --> 00:07:38.130
all right,
well,
you know,
they're,
uh,
they are of a particular race,

136
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:42.120
but they're not as tall as most people in that race.
So,
you know,

137
00:07:42.121 --> 00:07:45.450
there's sort of bite size.
They're like sliders,
sliders still.

138
00:07:45.451 --> 00:07:48.960
Like she would sliders,
you know,
get a little honey bun,
you know,

139
00:07:48.961 --> 00:07:51.750
stick a fucking ankle between the two.
Right.

140
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.330
Why would you do an ankle ankle meet?

141
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.050
Um,
so anyways,
I've,

142
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.760
I still feel fucked up from the Rose Bowl,
man.
I still don't know.

143
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.830
I barely got any sleep with Paul being out here.

144
00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:09.070
And then we also performed new years eve,
uh,

145
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.330
down the Orpheum and I bought this suit to wear New Year's Eve.

146
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:17.410
I found it like over the summertime.
It was just all white suit.

147
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:18.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

148
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.860
<v 1>Jacket and pants.
But you know,
from,
from a distance it reads all white.</v>

149
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:26.040
But when you come up to it,
it had these tiny black polka dots,

150
00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:28.720
you know what I mean?
Just tiny.
And uh,

151
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.630
I walked into this store and it was on like the fucking 70% off rack because

152
00:08:33.631 --> 00:08:35.100
it's really one of those things like,

153
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.550
where the fuck are you ever gonna wear that?
And I saw,
I was like,

154
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.830
that's a perfect suit for fucking new year's.

155
00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:44.340
You put the black fucking solid black shirt underneath.

156
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:46.950
They were little black pocket square,
right?

157
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.500
Then you walk out there like John Travolta,

158
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.200
but [inaudible] where you can't tell by the way I tell jokes,

159
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.280
I'm a fucking heck no time for originality.

160
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.830
I'm sorry.
Fucking shit jokes for me.
The jokes,

161
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.300
I don't like to use concepts.
I don't know.
Anyways,

162
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.640
so that was once again me standing to the side of the stage going like,
uh,

163
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.470
I am either go that people either going to like this suit or I'm going to get

164
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.020
heckled the entire time I'm out here.
But either way,

165
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.230
either way it's going to add to the fucking show.
But,
uh,

166
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.760
as I predicted it was new years,
I addressed the soup.

167
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.520
I said this is the only night I could wear it.
And people left and it was a,
uh,

168
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.720
it was a great fucking time,
great old theater.
And uh,

169
00:09:34.721 --> 00:09:38.030
I had a bunch of people come out,
um,

170
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.880
a bunch of friends,
you know,
people I hadn't seen it a couple of years.

171
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.940
People don't,
you know,
kind of in my life.
It was awesome man.

172
00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:47.280
I love doing new year's out here in La Cause uh,

173
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.840
I don't have to travel or anything like that and I get to do the job I love to

174
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.750
do.
However,
I think that's the last New Year's Eve I'll do,

175
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.490
I think I'll do like the 30th next time because I got to tell you the second

176
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:01.260
show ends right by the way,

177
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:06.261
I had to do the down to like two jokes before my closing joke.

178
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.960
I was like halfway through this one pit than I've been trying to work on.

179
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:13.260
I kept fucking up the ending and I was going to try a new ending to it because

180
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:16.980
the ending was too sad for every fucking city in this nation other than Dallas,

181
00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:20.790
Texas,
Dallas,
Texas.
Fucking enjoyed the shit out of the original ending.

182
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.283
Um,

183
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.640
and I'm right in the middle of that bit and I see that it's 1159 so then I had

184
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:30.630
to get out of the pit,
take a pause,
and then do the countdown,

185
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.530
and then the streamers came out.
Right.
Lovely.
Nia came out on stage,

186
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:37.290
gave me a kiss,
all the guys came,
you know,

187
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.710
we fucking waves and everything and then everybody gets off the stage and then I

188
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:45.090
had to go back into my act,
which was,
uh,
uh,
I dunno,

189
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:50.130
it just ended up being funny because it was really weird.
So anyways,

190
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.570
um,
we ended up doing the show and then as we leave,

191
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.550
um,
we're stuck in this brutal traffic.
I'm like,
what the fuck?

192
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:01.980
They must have been something going on because we went downtown La.

193
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.050
That must have been something going on down at like la live or some shit down

194
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:08.520
there.
That's right near the staples center.

195
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:13.521
And then I fucking realized the next day it was motley crew's final show ever at

196
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:19.620
the staple center.
And um,
so I was like,
ah,

197
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.230
fuck,
that's the traffic we got stuck in.

198
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.180
And there's actually a clip up on youtube of,
you know,
Tommy Lee,

199
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:28.170
the drummer does,

200
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:33.340
he has a whole fucking rollercoaster attached to his drum kit where it turns

201
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:37.680
upside down and it goes out over the crowd and then comes back and all that
shit.

202
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.380
I mean,
the right there alone,
you know,

203
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.000
if you're the other members in the band,
you gotta be like,
dude,

204
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.360
this better be fucking worth it because the amount of money that's coming out of

205
00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:52.560
our checks to fucking carry that rig out on the fucking road.

206
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.850
You know what I mean?
One of those overhead costs.

207
00:11:55.851 --> 00:11:57.890
So I don't know if you guys have seen the video,

208
00:11:57.891 --> 00:12:02.270
it's their last fucking show ever.
And the thing gets stuck.

209
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.910
It gets stuck.

210
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.940
And Tommy use upside down on this thing in this roadies scamper and up the side

211
00:12:10.131 --> 00:12:13.970
of it,
like the fucking apes in planet of the apes when they run the golden gate

212
00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:14.804
bridge,
right.

213
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.700
This scamper and up the side of this thing and Tommy's just subside down like,

214
00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:21.170
what the fuck man?

215
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.910
The fuck it digs busted.
He's like,
hey la.

216
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.251
He's like,

217
00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:33.251
what do you look fuel okayed to sin when I'm hanging upside down in Los Angeles

218
00:12:33.261 --> 00:12:36.020
and he's just hanging upside down.
Yeah,

219
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.140
it's the most excrutiatingly uncomfortable thing.

220
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:42.500
I've seen a perform I have to go through in a long time.
He dead.

221
00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:46.280
What the fuck he could do?
I mean,
once you just go,

222
00:12:46.281 --> 00:12:50.580
well fuck the roller coaster man,
and you're still hanging upside down.

223
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.950
I mean,
what do you do?
It's just fucking brutal.

224
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.960
And the fact that it happened on the very last show,
you know,

225
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.450
I don't want to start any infighting.
I know the band doesn't exist anymore,

226
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:10.040
but I think Vince Neil did it.
I think the lead singer,
probably all these years,

227
00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:13.070
you know,
he's used to being out front and all the chicks dig it.
I'm,
you know,

228
00:13:13.071 --> 00:13:15.200
walking around with his Barbie hair and all that.

229
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.040
And then all the drama goes all the way out over the crowd and everybody's

230
00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:21.800
looking at him.
He maybe he got sick of it after all these years,

231
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.700
the amount of money that was coming out of his pay check to bring that fucking

232
00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:29.500
loopty loop rollercoaster with the fucking drum kit in it.
And he probably would,

233
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:31.730
he probably said,
hey,
have you buddy look at that over there.

234
00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:36.680
And then he just pulled a fuse.
Uh,
that doesn't make any sense.

235
00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:39.470
Build any sabotaging his own show.
Wow.
You know,

236
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.380
I can have a fucking theory.

237
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.740
Somebody could just email me with no fucking links or anything whatsoever and

238
00:13:47.741 --> 00:13:50.570
just tell me that the earth can sustain 100 billion people

239
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.180
anyways,
so we,
uh,
we're stuck in that traffic.

240
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.210
I didn't get home until like one 31 45,

241
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.500
fell asleep around two,

242
00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:07.250
and then I had to be up at 10:00 AM 10:00 AM to five to then be outside for the

243
00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:12.230
next 13 hours at the,
uh,
at the rose bowl this year we brought eight people.

244
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.140
And um,
one of my buddies who went there,

245
00:14:17.141 --> 00:14:22.020
he just called it the goon parade and I gotta be honest with you.
Uh,

246
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.630
that's kind of what we were.
Um,

247
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.560
I don't remember so much of it.

248
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.370
I remember the whole game cause I just stopped drinking because I had to drive.

249
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.330
So I just remember walking to the stadium and after that I remember the entire

250
00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:40.800
fucking game.
Um,
so I'll take you through what I remember.

251
00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:45.030
So we fucking get there right.
First time ever.
We get this so fucking early.

252
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.070
They haven't even opened the gate yet.
So when we finally get in,

253
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.030
we're parked outside the VIP parking.

254
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:57.680
I mean we had like a five minute walk to the stadium was fucking tremendous.
And,

255
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:02.120
uh,
I remember Bart,
nick given me a Miller high life,

256
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.800
the big grin on his face,

257
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:06.110
cause we always had the Miller high life to start the day.

258
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.150
La had got his fucking,
well I had made it by the way he made it,

259
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.530
you know,
I'll never smile again.
Um,

260
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.910
he made it and uh,

261
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.920
he got all three of his fires going and getting ready for the breakfast

262
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:22.670
sandwiches.

263
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:27.200
And I want to say that I waited till after I had law heads.

264
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.640
Unbelievable breakfast sandwich.

265
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:33.230
It's the best breakfast sandwich I have every fucking year is that one.

266
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.420
And it was absolutely delicious.
And my favorite thing was looking over at first,

267
00:15:36.421 --> 00:15:39.800
he,
after he was two bites in and I was like,
Hey Paul,
I go,

268
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:42.650
how's that breakfast sandwich?
And he just fucking shut me,
look like,

269
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:43.760
are you fucking kidding me?

270
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.410
So I was already site and I knew he was going to have a great time.
And um,

271
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.940
after that I was like,
Hey,
I'm like,
who wants a heater?
And everybody's like,
yeah,

272
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:56.430
right.
So he poured like fucking eight of them.
And I had these,
these,

273
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.640
those big square ice cubes,

274
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.110
I had made those and brought him over in a ziplock bag,
like a fucking,
you know,

275
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.090
key low a coke.
So I drop him into everybody's Plastic Cup in this so big,

276
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.030
they don't make it all the way down to the bottom of the glass.

277
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.890
So the booze is actually below the ice level and everybody's laughing.
I'm like,

278
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.480
well,
he just got a fucking,

279
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.650
he got to pour more booze in there and then you put your hand over the ice cube

280
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:25.460
and it'll melt down.
And that became the technique.
And then after that,

281
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:29.480
it just became like a slide shelf just to stuff.
I remember,

282
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.240
I remember a partner does this thing every year,
he gets off,

283
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.070
you know,
it gets out of the truck and he just screams at the top of his lungs.

284
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.540
Ladies and gentleman,

285
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.340
welcome to the grand daddy of all.

286
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.020
And everybody's always terrified,
sort of laughing,
whatever.
So these Iowa fans,

287
00:16:50.021 --> 00:16:53.240
somebody just said,
oh,
we do not need that voice here.

288
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.230
And immediately we're not liking us.
And uh,

289
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.320
I don't know.
I think that for whatever reason they were really,
they were like,

290
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.940
I want to say older than me,
but I'm pretty fucking old at this point.

291
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.940
I'm 47 I think they were in their 50s and for whatever reason they were playing

292
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:16.220
Drake.
All right.

293
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.340
And it was like fucking seven in the morning and they're fucking,

294
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:22.850
music was louder than our music.
So we're sitting there,

295
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:26.420
the sun hasn't even come up yet and we'll listen to you.

296
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:31.040
You still call me on your cell phone,
you'll use to you.
You too.

297
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.380
And it's just was fucking with doing like,
Oh God,

298
00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:37.790
I think I'd be playing that fucking song.
That song is like,
that's like,

299
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.240
there's a few songs that get played so much that you never need to hear them

300
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:45.080
again.
I think the original song was in the mood,

301
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.360
but I think Benny Goodman who was a Glenn Miller Dad,
Dad,
Dad,
Dad,
dad,

302
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.190
[inaudible].

303
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.930
I never need to hear that song ever again.
Right.

304
00:17:56.931 --> 00:18:01.931
I'd say book ending for way back in the day to fucking,

305
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.500
right now it goes in the mood.

306
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.580
Glenn Miller and then a cell phone

307
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.190
by Drake.
I know when yet.
Yeah,

308
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.390
Gay Oli me.
What thing?
Oh,

309
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.260
he's such a bitch and that fucking song it's basically,
hey,

310
00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:25.261
I used to just fuck you are used to I Yo yo and any she moves away and then he's

311
00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.760
upset that the woman got on with their life.

312
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:29.900
<v 2>Okay.</v>

313
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.390
<v 1>You know what a fucking he's,</v>

314
00:18:32.391 --> 00:18:36.920
is he one of those possessive guys who once he fuck something he feels like he

315
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:40.630
owns it for the rest of his life.
Let it go dude.

316
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.350
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

317
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.300
<v 1>All you were doing was fucking her and now what?</v>

318
00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:46.790
Now you want her because she's not there anymore.

319
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.860
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.280
<v 1>To come over and lick your balls and shape up your beard afterwards.</v>

321
00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:54.380
I mean fucking move on with your life drink.

322
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.320
Yo Yo yo Yo yo Yo.

323
00:18:57.321 --> 00:19:01.340
So that's fucking going on and all I know and they were annoyed with how loud

324
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.880
bart,
nick yelled too.

325
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.980
I don't know what happens somewhere between the beer that shot in the breakfast

326
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:08.490
sandwich,

327
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.490
I glance over and the older guy is chirping and fucking Bart next year at

328
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:16.350
Barton.
Nick is just staring straight ahead.

329
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

330
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.530
<v 1>600 yard stare,</v>

331
00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:22.630
just standing there and I see the guy talk and talk and talk and,

332
00:19:22.631 --> 00:19:25.670
and then I just see Joe just shrug his shoulders and be like,
wow,
you know,

333
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.930
I don't like your music.

334
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:39.030
And I gotta be honest with you.
I don't know what else he said.

335
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:43.200
But 10 minutes later those people were just gone and we never saw him again.

336
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.340
I don't know if they had like some VIP fucking,
you know,

337
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.540
Iowa Hawkeye he fucking barbecue thing,

338
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.790
that tent that they were going to,
I have no idea.

339
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.420
But we would die and laugh and they have one conversation with Joe,
like the hey,

340
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.570
do you mind keeping it down a little bit?
And Joe just gave him the deaths,

341
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:06.060
fucking,
you know,
the 600 yard stare and uh,

342
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:07.710
that was it.
They just fucking left.

343
00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:12.480
So that problem was solved and we would throwing the football around [inaudible]

344
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:17.630
I remembered everything but forgot the bacon and uh,
what's his face like?

345
00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:21.150
I was able to call an audible and he had some bison meat or something like that.

346
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:24.240
And Ed Bacon Grease figure that one out.
I don't know how the fuck he did it,

347
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:25.710
but um,

348
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.380
<v 2>yeah,</v>

349
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.760
<v 1>yeah.
And everything was going great.</v>

350
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.500
I was throwing the football around and then at some point I was just so fucking

351
00:20:33.501 --> 00:20:36.170
hammered that I,
I fell down

352
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:42.910
and I was one of those drunk falls where it took me like 17 I started falling

353
00:20:43.721 --> 00:20:48.380
and it took like 17 seconds for me to fall.
And the entire time I was saying,

354
00:20:48.381 --> 00:20:53.360
I'm sorry,
uh,
it's now known.
Yeah.
It's now known as the,
I'm sorry,

355
00:20:53.361 --> 00:20:54.194
fall.

356
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.210
And it took me so long to fall it just about everybody at the tailgates side.

357
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.520
And uh,
I think if what I happened was I was standing,

358
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.820
well I had had this tent,
you know,

359
00:21:07.821 --> 00:21:10.520
one of those four post at 10 things I was standing underneath it.

360
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.930
And unbeknownst to me was right behind me was my cooler and all the other

361
00:21:14.931 --> 00:21:18.740
coolers and all the bags of groceries sort of sprinkled out.
Right.

362
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.230
And I was talking and I did an about face to start walking and immediately

363
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.350
tripped over the first cooler.
All right.

364
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.710
And as I was trying to get my leg to an open area without stepping on hamburger

365
00:21:33.711 --> 00:21:36.110
buns,
I just,
you know,

366
00:21:36.111 --> 00:21:39.770
there wasn't any space to put my feet down and I was doing like,

367
00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:43.670
it was almost like a wide receiver after they catch a football and they try to

368
00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:45.770
stay in bounds a dance down the sidelines.

369
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:51.070
I was doing that but in between condiments and food and shit like that.

370
00:21:51.171 --> 00:21:54.680
And I just,
I never regained my balance,

371
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.290
but I didn't go down.
I swear to God,

372
00:21:57.291 --> 00:22:00.560
if it was probably real time was probably like a four second fall,

373
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:05.030
but that's a long time,
you know,
if you just fall,
Bam,
you're on the ground,

374
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.960
you know,
in under a second.
Right.
I would think depending,

375
00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:12.810
unless you really short and you get there a little quicker.
So I just kept going.

376
00:22:12.811 --> 00:22:14.400
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

377
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.230
And right is like my buddy Nate came over to try and stop me from falling.

378
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:18.720
I just,

379
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.720
I fucking landed on my back and I twisted my left knee and I hear the whole

380
00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:27.300
place laughing and I was laughing evidently my last step,

381
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.570
I stepped in some avocado and slipped on that and I just fucking went down like

382
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.840
just thud right on my back.
I landed like a wrestler,

383
00:22:36.841 --> 00:22:39.990
so it didn't even hurt where it was just my entire backside hit the ground at

384
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:42.480
the same time.
And um,

385
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.270
I remember talking about it later and I was like,
yeah,

386
00:22:45.271 --> 00:22:48.180
but I didn't spill my drink.
I didn't spill my drink.
And every,
she's like,
yeah,

387
00:22:48.181 --> 00:22:50.520
you did.
You did.
You spilled it all over the front of your jacket.

388
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.020
So,
um,

389
00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.580
then I remember getting up the apple pies out.
Why?

390
00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:02.190
Remember the brisket and the ribs being done in those were delicious.

391
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.690
Lie had killing it as always.
And then,
um,

392
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.110
<v 0>okay,</v>

393
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.380
<v 1>I think I smoked a cigar next.
Yeah,</v>

394
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:15.970
I smoked a cigar and then we had the apple pies and everybody freaked out and

395
00:23:15.971 --> 00:23:19.300
they loved them.
And then I was,
yeah.
Then I smoked a cigar and I was like,

396
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:19.530
all right,

397
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:24.490
I gotta fucking sober up here because a good six hours the game will be over and

398
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:28.780
we'll be done.
And then I got to drive.
So,
um,
ah,
fuck.

399
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.450
Hang on a second.
Hang on.
Alright,
I'm back.

400
00:23:33.451 --> 00:23:36.260
Sorry about that.
Had to blow my fucking nose.
So anyways,

401
00:23:36.261 --> 00:23:37.460
so let me get into the A,

402
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.470
we get into the game and I still don't know his fucking name because I was

403
00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.940
hammered.
Um,

404
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.190
the running back for Stanford just was why does we got to the stadium?

405
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:51.710
You already ran for a touchdown and then it was just like,

406
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:55.700
it was like a fucking Hollywood movie.
They couldn't stop this kid.

407
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.850
The kid even had another one.
He ran like 70 yards for a touchdown.

408
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:02.910
They had to bring it back.
They just couldn't fucking get the kid down.
Um,

409
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.720
and before you knew it,
it was like 28 to nothing,
28 to nothing.

410
00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:12.380
Then it was 35 to nothing.
And we,
we still had like half,

411
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.270
half of the second quarter that the fucking gay was just over it.

412
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.340
It was the worst rose bowl game as far as being competitive that I've been to

413
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.880
slash the greatest individual performance I've ever seen.

414
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.020
We got to see that kid.

415
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:32.000
He set the record for the most all purpose yards ever in a rose bowl.

416
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.820
Um,
and this is the granddaddy of a mall.
It's the original roles.
Uh,

417
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:42.350
the original,
uh,
I guess bull game,
um,

418
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.730
even though the Yale Bulls,

419
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:47.480
the original bull stadium figure that one out anyways.
Um,

420
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.520
so we got to see that.

421
00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:53.960
And fortunately during halftime I didn't have to watch the Stanford band.

422
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.110
Um,
which by the way,
it's just,
I mean,
it could,
you,

423
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.680
could they be more of a bunch of hipsters,
the whole,
the whole thing.

424
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:06.500
It's like they're mocking the halftime show yet,

425
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.640
not showing how you can improve it.
So there's like no risk.

426
00:25:10.641 --> 00:25:13.610
He just sort of mocking the whole fucking thing.
Like,
which is to me,

427
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:15.140
classic hipster behavior.

428
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.430
To me that's the difference between nerds and hipsters.
You know what I mean?

429
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.440
It's like,
all right,
so you think what the,
the,

430
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.840
the standard way that a halftime show is done is too rigid.

431
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.010
So you guys are going to,
I just hate how the whole thing and said,
oh,

432
00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:32.090
these guys are crazy.
Oh,

433
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:36.260
look at the guy with the fucking rainbow wig play in the drum.
Oh,

434
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:38.720
what's he going to do?
I will think it's fucking dumb.

435
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.440
And then I just thought it was a badly made California look bad when they made

436
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:47.360
fun of the Iowa people with the whole,
uh,
you know,
farmers only.

437
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.540
And once again,
I don't know,
I don't know anybody in the Stanford band,

438
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:53.300
but it just seems like that classic,
I live near an ocean,

439
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:54.620
therefore I'm smarter than you.

440
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.830
There's something about people live on the coasts with their whole attitude

441
00:25:57.831 --> 00:26:00.740
towards the middle of the countries,
the funniest fucking thing ever to me,

442
00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:04.010
like flyover state and Blahblahblahblahblah and all that.

443
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.130
It's like those fucking people that you're sitting there and making fun of,

444
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.420
you know,
the farmers old,
hey,
why don't you go out there and go fuck your sister?

445
00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:15.110
It's like you,
you mean the people who grow the food supply for this country?

446
00:26:15.111 --> 00:26:17.810
You fucking dope.
What are you doing with that?
With the flute?

447
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.220
Oh look at the cool kid with the clarinet.
I Dunno.

448
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.640
I thought it was a hacky joke and um,

449
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.870
I dunno.
You know what I mean?
Look,
if you guys look,
you know,

450
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:32.870
just decided to trash one another,
then it would be funny,

451
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:35.030
but it just kind of comes off like a,

452
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.480
it's like when Ricky Gervais' does that shit at the Golden Globes,

453
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.343
you know what I mean?

454
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.660
He hires a staff of writers to write roast jokes aimed at people who showed up

455
00:26:43.661 --> 00:26:47.800
with acceptance speeches and it's just a,
Gee,
did you win that one?

456
00:26:47.801 --> 00:26:51.190
What are you gonna do next?
Slap an ice cream out of a five year old hand.
I just,

457
00:26:51.191 --> 00:26:54.850
I dunno,
it's the same thing with that.
I thought it was due she behavior,

458
00:26:54.851 --> 00:26:59.220
but fortunately I missed all of it,
you know,
and yeah,

459
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:02.730
he came out with the paper and reshaped cow.
It'll be epic.

460
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.070
Kill yourselves.

461
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.140
It'd be one thing of Stanford Everly actually put on a good halftime show.
Like,

462
00:27:10.141 --> 00:27:12.030
wow,
this band is next level.

463
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:15.360
I get why they're trying to break the whole fucking format of it.

464
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.660
But if you actually watch the competitions are the best fucking college bands

465
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:23.670
out there,
they're fucking drum lines alone.

466
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:24.953
<v 2>Okay.</v>

467
00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.950
<v 1>Would destroy anyone in that band.
So,
uh,
you know,
I dunno,</v>

468
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.490
every once in a while I'm a fucking conservative and I'm a conservative on that

469
00:27:33.491 --> 00:27:36.730
one too.
I just,
yeah,
you give kind of fucking made an ass of yourself.

470
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:41.110
But anyways,
I just hate the deliberately bad dancing that they do.

471
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.490
I think if you can a mock dancing,
you should be able to dance wealth,
you know,

472
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.480
to just suck at it and then be like making fun of it.
Then you just fucking like,

473
00:27:49.481 --> 00:27:53.740
all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It just like we thought,
yeah,
you don't have any talents.

474
00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:02.200
Fuck the Stanford band.
I love their football program.
No.
Anyways.

475
00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.460
Uh,
so while all of that was going on,
all that,

476
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.780
that fucking nauseatingly hipster behavior,
uh,

477
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:15.280
the looks on their faces,
like everyone in the crowd is like,
their mind is blown.

478
00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:17.830
Like,
oh my God,
what's going on?

479
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.500
It's the fuck you read the band.

480
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.800
<v 2>Okay.</v>

481
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.460
<v 1>It play in the fucking triangle out there.
You're not a rebel.</v>

482
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.430
You're not freaking anybody out.

483
00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.813
<v 2>Uh,</v>

484
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.510
<v 1>so anyways,
uh,</v>

485
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.080
we actually went out to the concession stand and,
um,

486
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.600
you know,
just standing the whole fucking halftime was standing in this,
in this,

487
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.980
in this line.
And we actually missed the first three minutes of the,
uh,

488
00:28:45.981 --> 00:28:48.740
the third quarter and I'm standing in this line,

489
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.900
comedian Shawn Coyne from Philly.
He's fucking Hilarious,
right?

490
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.280
So we get all the way up there and a,

491
00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:01.310
I ordered a pretzel and a water and he ordered a pretzel and something else and

492
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:05.140
uh,
I'm fucking common around.
He's still drinking,
you know,

493
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.030
he doesn't have to drive,

494
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:10.260
so he's still fucking drinking during the game and they hand him the Pretzel.

495
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.070
Any proceeds after we waited a half an hour for a food,

496
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.540
she hands him the Pretzel.
Any fucking just fumbled it.

497
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.050
It was like a bad exchange between the quarterback and the running back.

498
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:25.290
You know,
they like bump into each other.
The dude never quite has the ball.

499
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.060
He never quite had the pretzel and it just goes end over end and like slow

500
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:35.061
motion and falls salt side down onto the concrete where everybody's standing.

501
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.740
He immediately bends down and picks it up.

502
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.170
And I'm looking at him and he just goes,
he's like,
yeah,
it's all right.

503
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:44.220
It's all right.
I'm like,
dude,
you got to give that thing back.
And he's like,
Nah,

504
00:29:44.221 --> 00:29:47.480
it's alright.
It's alright.
He doesn't give a fuck.
So I'm die lab.

505
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.850
Like this guy's a maniac.

506
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.720
It's like people walking in and out our restrooms and then coming over his

507
00:29:52.721 --> 00:29:54.880
standing in this food line.
He outta your fucking mind,

508
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.460
but it's still kind of drunk.
So then I go over with,

509
00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.520
we're putting mustard on the pretzel and then out of nowhere fucking lie edge

510
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:07.741
shows up and he as he has Sean for the piece of Miss Bretz loan,

511
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:12.040
he gave it so I almost fucking faded.
I was laughing.

512
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:15.060
So hard fucking thing was on the grout.

513
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:20.840
I was like,
it was like watching a poison,

514
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.810
but I couldn't say anything.
I was laughing so fucking hard.
So,
uh,

515
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.970
then we get,
we finally get back into the,
uh,

516
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.220
finally get back into the,
uh,

517
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:36.250
the stadium and then just the whole game just stopped.
I mean,

518
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:40.990
there was barely any scoring.
Iowa came back and scored a couple.
Um,

519
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:45.880
I was psyched for Versie cause he,
uh,
he went to Betsy,

520
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:46.900
but you bet Stanford.

521
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:50.050
And then in the next half he bet the over he won both of them.

522
00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:53.050
So he picked up a buck 50 or something like that.
And um,

523
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.940
I don't know.
Then we just ended up going back.
The game was over.

524
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.500
And then we went back to,
uh,
the truck.

525
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.970
We were hanging out,
we got the bonfire going,
the sun was down,

526
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.640
and in the middle of the having the bonfire,

527
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:14.590
all of a sudden this kid comes walking by with another friend,

528
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:19.360
this Iowa Kid.
And he just goes,
he just goes,
hey.
He goes,

529
00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:23.130
Hey ted bonfires illegal.
You can't have it.
It's illegal.
And Rice.

530
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.120
He was [inaudible] like go like,
Hahaha,

531
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.680
I'm just fucking around the Philly guy.

532
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.480
He goes,
oh,
shut the fuck up.
You fucking Blah,
blah,
blah.
Right.

533
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.650
And then the kid fucking puffs up his chest.

534
00:31:38.651 --> 00:31:43.390
There's like 10 of us sitting here.
This camp was like,
uh,
he was like five,

535
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:45.010
six,
five,
seven.

536
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.240
He comes running up talking all this shit.

537
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.360
And I'm just sitting there looking at him like,
it's fucking 10 of us here,

538
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.890
you know,
do you have an oozy?
Like what,
what are you doing?
Right?

539
00:31:56.891 --> 00:32:00.220
So he gets into it,
there's back and forth and next thing you know,

540
00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:04.570
versus over there and it looks like first he's about ready to square off with

541
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:07.560
the guy because the guy kept walking away.
But like,
all right,
all right,
whatever,

542
00:32:07.561 --> 00:32:10.720
whatever.
And He'd be like,
Oh,
have fun,
fun,
fun but fuck you.

543
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:12.970
Because we'd always had the glass thing and then we'd be like,
fuck you.

544
00:32:12.971 --> 00:32:15.340
And it just kept going back and forth and back and forth.

545
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.730
Then finally the guys like 30 yards away versus talking to them and I thought

546
00:32:20.771 --> 00:32:24.220
like,
oh,
this kid's going to soccer room.
So I got up over there and go,
relax,

547
00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:28.300
relax,
relax.
And then all of a sudden I hear a bottle break

548
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.680
in this fucking maniac Philly guy,
right fucking based upon,

549
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:40.560
it's the funniest thing ever.
He breaks the bottle,
the pavement,
any bucket.

550
00:32:40.561 --> 00:32:45.000
And he did it way too hard.
When he brought his hand up,
there was no bottle left.

551
00:32:45.001 --> 00:32:48.890
He just shattered the fucking thing.
But then he liked mine.

552
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.020
Like he still had the bottle in his hand and this is the best part.

553
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.260
The Iowa kid talking shit,
never fledged.

554
00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.740
So now he's pretending he had a bottle in his hand.

555
00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:03.100
I don't even know what he was gonna do was like a fucking movie.
It's like,

556
00:33:03.101 --> 00:33:04.000
what the fuck?
Right.

557
00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.620
So the dude finally goes away as the yell of few more fucking things and um,

558
00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:13.000
it was so ridiculous.
Then we went back and we,

559
00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.710
we were sitting around and all we did for the rest of the time there was make

560
00:33:17.711 --> 00:33:22.711
fun of Sean and how there was no bottle left and he actually cut his hand and we

561
00:33:23.111 --> 00:33:25.570
were all just sitting there going like,
two,
what were you going to do?
What?

562
00:33:25.571 --> 00:33:28.730
He's like,
I don't know.
I don't know what I always wanted to do that.
It was,

563
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.760
it's fucking ridiculous.
So,
um,
and by then,

564
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.220
you know,
actually as I was coming out of the game,
I,
I was,
I was so sober,

565
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:42.260
I had already gotten,
gotten into the fucking hangover,

566
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:45.590
so I just started drinking waters.
And,
um,

567
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:51.820
then had another two hot dogs and a hamburger and I got to tell you dude,

568
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.570
my body was like,
what the fuck?

569
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.560
And I just drove home like with a splitting fucking headache,

570
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.860
stone sober,
splitting fucking headache.
And um,

571
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:09.430
and then by then my knee was killing me and I was walking like I had just

572
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:14.630
written a horse from here to fucking Massachusetts and I was,

573
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.740
I was shot.

574
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.900
I came home and I just fucking just pounded like three waters.

575
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.550
And that was,
it was during that time where I was just thinking to myself like,

576
00:34:25.551 --> 00:34:29.930
I'm never going to that game again.
I fucking,
you know,

577
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:35.750
when you're out three to six weeks with a fucking knee strain cause you went to

578
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:38.990
a tailgate,
you really got to start like looking back going like what the fuck?

579
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.460
But it happened to me again this year,
you know,
every year and go,
you know,

580
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.990
I'm going to go a little easy,
I'm going to go easy.

581
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:46.790
I want to remember as much of this tailgate as I can.

582
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.010
Like I passed out for like an hour of it and it popped.

583
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:51.500
Part of it was the alcohol,
but the other part was just like,

584
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.440
I had only gotten three hours sleep.
You know,

585
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:59.300
there's only so far you can go when you start the day off with a male.

586
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.730
All right,
let me,
um,
but it was one of the,
one of the best,
uh,

587
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:09.640
one of the best fucking tailgates.
And I loved hanging with fucking,
uh,

588
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.380
all the new people that came along.
And I am now of course,

589
00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:14.920
obsessed with the Philly accent.

590
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.920
It's the funniest fucking accent he got.

591
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.350
Be At bake a soul.
Everything's a John.

592
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.620
Um,
alright,
hang on a second.
Right.

593
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:31.400
Let me type in my password here so I can do a couple of reads.
Come on.

594
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.390
I love that they make you pick such a fucking difficult one that,
you know,

595
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.970
it takes me like three times to type because it's some capitals and then there's

596
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:42.180
some not capitals.
Like if someone broke into my computer,

597
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:47.070
I don't understand what they would be getting.
Um,
all right.
Okay.
Oh,
Jesus.

598
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.270
I mean,
you know,
if I had the fucking energy,
it usually takes,

599
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:53.190
it takes me three days to get over the fucking rose bowl.
This is the third day.

600
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.340
All right.
Uh Oh look,

Mercifully,

681
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:44.220
that's the last bit of reading I have to do here for the fucking week.
Um,

682
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.990
all right,
and with that,
let's get to uh
oh.

683
00:40:48.991 --> 00:40:52.720
Can we talk a little NFL football for?
I said,
well,
I have dat,
dat,
dat,
boom,

684
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.573
boom dude.

685
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.780
I would say the Patriots in Seattle entered the playoffs the exact opposite way.

686
00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.160
I'm going to go out on a limb,

687
00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.870
a the patriots just could not get anything going offensively.
Um,

688
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.220
our offensive line is just,
uh,
it's,
it's,

689
00:41:08.221 --> 00:41:12.780
it's fucking shad.
It dude,
we got nobody left every time Brady went to pass.

690
00:41:12.781 --> 00:41:17.280
There was someone in the backfield.
Um,
defense did great though.

691
00:41:17.281 --> 00:41:20.190
I mean it was holding them to like 10 points for most of the fucking game.

692
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.450
But um,
hopefully we can get healthy or I don't,

693
00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.100
I don't see us going too deep into the playoffs this year.

694
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.210
Seattle on the other 10.
Okay.

695
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.300
<v 4>Daily.
Right now this is the wildcard t nobody wants to play.</v>

696
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.240
<v 1>Put you.
Yes.
Yourself.</v>

697
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.170
<v 2>Oh,
they peak too early.</v>

698
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:41.590
Seattle look like world beaters and the way that they handled the fucking

699
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:44.000
cardinals yesterday,
they made them,
I mean,

700
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:46.040
I don't know if the car don't start at the back or not.
I mean,

701
00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:50.510
I watched the first fucking half and it looked like an NFL team playing a CFL

702
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:54.530
team.
Let me check out the final score here.
Um,
okay.

703
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:55.381
<v 1>I mean,</v>

704
00:41:55.381 --> 00:42:00.120
I think it's just another phenomenal coaching job by Pete Carroll.

705
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:01.583
Um,

706
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:02.720
<v 2>yeah.</v>

707
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.830
<v 1>And he's got like,
he's got them right about 36 to six.
Yeah.</v>

708
00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:08.270
They just destroyed them.

709
00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:09.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

710
00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:14.070
<v 1>Scoring at will do whenever the,
whatever the fuck they wanted.
You know,</v>

711
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:16.500
Arizona special teams would look in like shit,

712
00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:18.990
their field goal kicker and mixed a couple extra points.

713
00:42:18.991 --> 00:42:21.270
I don't know what the fuck was going on with them and they couldn't tackle

714
00:42:21.271 --> 00:42:23.420
anybody on punch or kick offs.

715
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:29.420
The only question mark I saw was Seattle was there a kicker missed another one

716
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:34.110
and Richard Sherman's hair.
That's the only thing I found.

717
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.160
That's the second time this year is Scherman has been brought down by his hair.

718
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.430
Um,
to the point they actually thought it was a face mask.

719
00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:45.780
He went down so fucking his head went down.
Uh,
but other than that,

720
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:46.733
uh,

721
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:47.820
<v 2>okay.</v>

722
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.450
<v 1>I was,
I was the guy,
you know,
a couple of weeks ago just thinking like,
you know,</v>

723
00:42:51.451 --> 00:42:54.960
Arizona and,
uh,
Carolina,

724
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.610
now I think it's a

725
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.270
Carolina is would play Seattle at home.
But I gotta tell Ya,

726
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.120
Seattle doesn't give a fuck.
They've been there the last two years in a row.

727
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.990
Um,
if they would,
and again this year a lot of people going to be like,
oh,

728
00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:15.890
they do,
who one play away for winning it three times in a row.

729
00:43:15.891 --> 00:43:19.600
That's absolute bullshit.
That's absolute bullshit.
Um,

730
00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:23.630
you went two in a row.
If you win the fucking thing,
it changes.

731
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.660
It changes you vibe,
you know,

732
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:31.460
defending versus bad taste in your mouth.
You know what I mean?

733
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:36.140
How long do you think Pete Carroll's was able to actually get eight hours sleep

734
00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:37.220
after that super bowl?

735
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:41.840
Like the drive that he's had to get back because that they fucked that thing up.

736
00:43:41.841 --> 00:43:46.841
Slash Malcolm Butler may one of the greatest defensive plays of all time like

737
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.870
battle.
You know,
there's a reason why nobody's ever won three in a row.
It's,

738
00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:54.950
you know,
it's hard to stay that fucking motivated.

739
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.750
I think anyways.
Um,

740
00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.440
and I know watching the Patriots when the defending Superbowl champions for

741
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:03.230
instance,
just being the Patriots,
which is bad enough,

742
00:44:03.231 --> 00:44:04.550
people want to beat you bad enough,

743
00:44:04.551 --> 00:44:06.950
but when you're the defending Superbowl champion,

744
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:11.270
even the shit teams try hard against you.
Um,
but anyways,

745
00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:15.070
having said all that,
um,
you know,

746
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.530
the way Seattle's played over the last month in that last game,

747
00:44:17.531 --> 00:44:22.030
like they look like fucking world beaters.
Um,

748
00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.370
so,
and us,

749
00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:27.220
I don't know if we could beat the Broncos at this point with how fucking injured

750
00:44:27.221 --> 00:44:31.950
we are.
Even with their,
uh,
they're quarterback.
I,

751
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:34.590
that was hard to see Peyton manning be a backup man,

752
00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:39.180
but he took it like a gentleman.
Um,
I wonder if that was his last game.

753
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.990
I wonder.
I wonder.
I wonder.
All right,
let's get to,

754
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:47.040
let's get to the fucking questions here for this week.
Right.
And by the way,

755
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:48.780
for all the Canadian fans,

756
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:51.720
I'm not ducking the fact that you guys destroyed us in that game.

757
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:55.260
I just haven't seen it yet.
I started to watch it yesterday and after all the,

758
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.690
the Hoopla and all of that shit,

759
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.020
I got like a minute and a half in the game and they already scored.

760
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:05.490
It was just like,
oh man.
I think the final was five to one.

761
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:09.840
So congratulations to Yukon.
But um,
oh,

762
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:14.010
I got to fix my cooler to my cooler.
Took a beating.
Both hinges.
What?

763
00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:16.200
Broken as the interiors strap.

764
00:45:16.201 --> 00:45:20.130
Thank thankfully a Igloo makes a repair kit night.
You know,

765
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:24.300
it's obviously an easy repair.
I got to get that fucking taken care of this week.

766
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.470
Uh,
that,
that fucking coolest spend to every rose bowl.
I got to fix it up here.

767
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.120
Who knows?
Maybe when I fell,

768
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:34.290
I'm the one who knocked the fucking lid off the thing.
All right,
breakfast it.

769
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:38.670
We go.
There's no way it did.
45 minutes.
Jesus Christ.
It's flying by,

770
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.380
right breakfast bill.

771
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:45.770
I'm a father of two young children and I hold a nine to five corporate job.

772
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.810
Don't feel bad for me though.
I love my job.
That's awesome.

773
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.290
I want you to love your job.
And he goes and I don't bitch.

774
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:56.880
About how hard it is to be a parent.
Uh,
he goes,
I maintain a decent diet.

775
00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.510
I was a college athlete,
so I have a basic understanding of the human body.

776
00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.000
Granted you and I spend our mornings differently.

777
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.600
I freeze my ass off every morning for five to six months of the year.

778
00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.000
Uh,
I was wondering what you do for breakfast every morning?

779
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.220
I don't know.
There's,
what do you mean you freeze your ass off?
What do you do?
Oh,

780
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.840
you have,
I'm wondering what you do for breakfast every morning.

781
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:22.860
And then he goes on to say I'm always on the go and I'm not hungry right when I

782
00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:24.470
leave for work,
uh,

783
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.840
which leaves me in the car and at the office for the rest of the morning.

784
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.940
Not a lot of options.
Uh,
beyond a banana and a coffee.

785
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:37.410
It's too cold for smoothies.
What's Amanda do?
What's your morning food routine?

786
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.420
Well,
when I'm being smart,

787
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.490
I have two eggs over easy and I have some oatmeal with a,

788
00:46:42.491 --> 00:46:46.710
a banana and maybe some blueberries.
I don't have any,
uh,

789
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.950
bread or any of that stuff.
And then between breakfast and lunch I have an apple.

790
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.640
And then for lunch I have Turkey slices with a side salad.

791
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.550
And then at four o'clock I have a meet with a protein and six o'clock meet with

792
00:47:02.551 --> 00:47:06.290
the protein and uh,
meet with the protein.

793
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:11.291
I have a protein with vegetables to fuck my brain is shot here I have,

794
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.190
yeah,
I have a protein with some vegetables,
meat with the protein.

795
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:23.040
And then I have a bread with some carbs.
Um,
that's what I ended up doing.

796
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:26.850
And then I just,
I stopped eating around six,
five,

797
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:29.950
six is when I have my last meal and then I just drink after that.

798
00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:30.940
If I get really hungry,

799
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:34.510
I just have celery with peanut butter and I got to get back to that diet because

800
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:38.710
I've been cooking up a fucking storm,
bacon and all that type of stuff.
Um,

801
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.150
and I have three goals this month I'm going to make a quiche.

802
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:47.950
I'm going to make a fucking Lasagna and I want to make this hunter's chicken the

803
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:52.951
last two or Mario Batali recipes and a Dodgers chicken isn't that bad.

804
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.870
The fucking,
um,

805
00:47:56.690 --> 00:48:01.130
the LASAGNA is pretty bad,
but there's veal in it and I just can't,

806
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.830
I can't get myself to eat lobster or veal.
I just,

807
00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.080
just what the fuck they go through.
I mean,

808
00:48:06.081 --> 00:48:08.690
I know the chickens and cows already have a bad enough thing,
but like,

809
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:13.750
it just seems extra fucking cruel.
Boiling something alive and,

810
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:18.080
and having something just sit in a fucking cage forever so it's softer and

811
00:48:18.081 --> 00:48:21.770
tastes better when you eat.
It's just this fucking brutal.
Um,

812
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.060
anyways.
All right,
so what's my morning routine?
Yeah,
well,

813
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.200
if I was you and I had to,
I would eat,
I would get up,

814
00:48:29.201 --> 00:48:33.100
I wouldn't make the time and I would at least just have some oatmeal,

815
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.360
um,
a man,
but I don't have kids.
I mean,

816
00:48:37.361 --> 00:48:41.890
I just hear you guys talking about having kids.
Makes me glad I don't have any.

817
00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:45.140
I mean,
it just seems so fucking,
uh,

818
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.230
just never ending.
Never ending.
Um,

819
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.720
I dunno.
So I will,
I will.
Well,
what do you do for breakfast?
All right.

820
00:48:55.721 --> 00:49:00.630
I told you I did the whole day.
Um,
yeah,

821
00:49:00.631 --> 00:49:02.430
if I was you,
I would,
you have to make the time.

822
00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.330
I would definitely say that you gotta make the time and uh,

823
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.830
I think the best thing for working out,

824
00:49:07.831 --> 00:49:10.500
it should do it in the morning and he'd just get it out of the way.

825
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.550
And then you have a healthy breakfast and that gets you on the right track to

826
00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:18.540
start the day,
to start off the day.
If you're eating bad and then try to be like,

827
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:20.340
well,
don't worry,
I'm going to go to the gym later.

828
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:24.840
The problem is with bad food is it chemically fucks your body and it makes you

829
00:49:24.841 --> 00:49:28.860
just want to lay down and do nothing.
So,
uh,
if you start the day,

830
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.680
I dunno,
just do that,
that the tense about,

831
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:38.700
I was telling you guys about the tents to start off as like a 10 jumping jacks,

832
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:42.870
10 burpees,
10 push ups,
10 alternating lunges,

833
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.070
10 sit ups.
I forget the fucking order.
I haven't done it,
but you can,

834
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.890
you can look it up on the Internet and find it and uh,

835
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:55.560
and you go from 10 and then you do nine jumping jacks,
nine burpees,
nine pushups,

836
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:59.820
sit ups,
nine alternate leg jumps,
nine squat jumps.

837
00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.700
And then you do eight.
You go all the way down to one and then you'd,
you know,

838
00:50:02.701 --> 00:50:05.820
you're pretty much winded.
And then if you want to add a little more cardio too,

839
00:50:05.821 --> 00:50:06.654
it's skip,

840
00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:10.660
skip rope for a round or two or three or whatever you want to fucking do.
A,

841
00:50:10.661 --> 00:50:13.830
you could do that workout and like a hotel room.
Um,

842
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.930
but that's what I would do.

843
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.210
I would do something like that and that would just make sure,

844
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.980
you know also if you really don't have time to work out,
but uh,

845
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:24.360
really helped you during the day is to bring an apple into pack.

846
00:50:24.361 --> 00:50:28.550
A healthy lunch also saves you money also gives you more of a lunch hour cause

847
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:30.650
you're not driving to and from wherever the fuck you go.

848
00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:34.490
When you go right down to the cafeteria,
you knock it out,
it chill the fuck out.

849
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:36.043
You know,

850
00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.770
you have something healthy and your afternoon break and that's the biggest
thing,

851
00:50:41.771 --> 00:50:44.860
dude.
If you're not putting mistakes into your fucking mouth,

852
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.740
you're going to get more results from your workout and you,
you know,

853
00:50:47.741 --> 00:50:49.360
you've closed the start fitting better.

854
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:53.500
And the same way you get addicted to eating bad salt,
sugar,
salt,
sugar,

855
00:50:53.501 --> 00:50:55.850
you can get addicted to eating well.
Uh,

856
00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.550
which where is not where I'm at right now.
Um,
all right,
one trick pony.

857
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:06.790
Hey Billy balls.
Uh,
my wife loves you.

858
00:51:06.791 --> 00:51:10.990
It pie crust video.
Oh by the way,
you know,
I tried lied in my,
um,

859
00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:15.100
for my crust for the first time and it was a total game changer.

860
00:51:15.101 --> 00:51:19.780
That would best crust I ever made.
It did feel weird to smell bacon is,

861
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:22.660
I was making the pie crust,
but um,

862
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:24.170
<v 0>okay.</v>

863
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:27.840
<v 1>Um,
uh,
thank you to everybody that suggested that who,
you know,
the,
your,</v>

864
00:51:27.841 --> 00:51:32.270
your critique really helped my pie crust.
Thank you.
Um,
all right.
So anyways,

865
00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:36.230
she as person says,
she's a fan of yours as well.

866
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.870
You got the pie crust video.
She's a fan of goes as well.

867
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.990
And it's been exposed to hours of your podcasts.
She likes you,
Bill.

868
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.950
Let me lead with that.
Well here comes the big fucking slap in the face,

869
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:48.890
but of course like all great women,

870
00:51:48.891 --> 00:51:51.860
she still is a capacity that shop a man down at the knees.

871
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.580
After the video I casually said,
can't wait for the next one.

872
00:51:55.970 --> 00:52:00.050
She responded in an Oh sweetie tone with ha ha.

873
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:04.160
Well how many of these tricks do you think he has up his sleeve?

874
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.720
This resulted in a long discussion where I defended your potential skills and

875
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:11.030
she went with the,
I love bill burr.

876
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:16.030
I'm just assuming he doesn't have much more to rival this pie crust.

877
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:21.050
Uh,
whether you can make a full series out of these videos are not.

878
00:52:21.051 --> 00:52:24.440
Can you please explain to my wife that you're not a one trick pony?

879
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.480
And even if you are a one trick pony,

880
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:31.190
it's bullshit and unfair to assume this much.
Uh,
thanks.
Come back to Wisconsin.

881
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.720
Home of corruption as seen in documentaries.
Um,

882
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.220
well you know something.
As you get older,
as a man,

883
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.290
you understand where that's coming from.
Why your wife,
as you said,

884
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:48.680
like all great women always have to take you out of the knees.
What it is.

885
00:52:48.681 --> 00:52:52.430
As much as you got to stop internalizing that and taking it personally,

886
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:57.970
what it is is that it's almost like a subconscious fear thing that they have.

887
00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:00.710
You know what I mean?

888
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.370
Like when they don't know you and they see you doing something,

889
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.230
they have a positive reaction to it.
Oh look,
he can make a pie crust.

890
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:13.490
I bet he's going to be a great dad.
Right?
They think shit like that.

891
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:18.620
But after they get with you and then they love you and they don't want to lose

892
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:23.090
you when they see you continuing to grow as a person,
they,

893
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.190
I can't even,
this is a female thing.

894
00:53:26.191 --> 00:53:31.191
This is like a thing in general that people do in relationships as you actually

895
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:35.550
hold back the person you love because you see them expanding on who they are

896
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:38.760
because it's something new and different and moves in a different direction.

897
00:53:38.761 --> 00:53:43.170
I think subconsciously a certain type of person feels insecure,

898
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.860
so then they have to tether it to the ground with fucking,
uh,

899
00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.400
criticism rather than encouraging the person.

900
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.570
So I think that that's where it's coming from.
But um,

901
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.910
as far as addressing it,

902
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:02.730
like I will just say this as far as my cooking and baking,

903
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:07.790
like you don't just know how to make corn flakes and you can also make a pie

904
00:54:07.831 --> 00:54:09.150
crust,
you know what I mean?

905
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.680
No one had to make a pie crust takes all of your shit to the next level.

906
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.200
Okay.
Like,
no,
like,
no this because I can do that.
Like back in the day,

907
00:54:19.201 --> 00:54:22.200
I used to look at like making like a quiche or something like that going,

908
00:54:22.201 --> 00:54:22.591
oh my God,

909
00:54:22.591 --> 00:54:26.730
that's fucking impossible to cross the loan or making a Turkey pot pie or

910
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:30.660
anything that involves having a crust.
Um,

911
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:34.080
you can add that I recently have learned how to smoke meat.
You know,

912
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:37.360
I smoked ribs.
Uh,

913
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.510
I can make all of my,
my,
my mother,
before we,
when we all moved out,

914
00:54:42.511 --> 00:54:44.310
she wrote out all of her recipes,

915
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:50.070
hand wrote them all out on cards and we have all of them and we can all cook the

916
00:54:50.071 --> 00:54:52.260
meals that she made when we were growing up.
Like,

917
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:57.270
I can make you a Hungarian Goulash and you know what else I can make the fucking

918
00:54:57.271 --> 00:55:01.530
noodles from scratch.
I took a pasta making class,
you know,

919
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:05.970
as you suspected,
sir,
your wife has no idea what the fuck she's talking about.

920
00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:09.990
What it really was.
It was coming from a place of insecurity and jealousy.

921
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:13.450
And right now she's gonna roll her eyes and be like,
oh my God,
but blah,

922
00:55:13.451 --> 00:55:18.420
blah blah.
It's fucking true.
You know?
Cause that's really just like a,

923
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:24.000
just like to have like that,
that Oh sweetie tone you now they do that shit.

924
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.410
You know,
you go out,
he started looking a little too good.

925
00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:32.310
You get a new new suit,
right?
You look in the,
that they got a fucking,
they got,

926
00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.780
they got to make a comment.
They fucking do it with each other.
It's hilarious.

927
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.680
I think that's one of the main reasons that's fucking them up by the way.

928
00:55:40.681 --> 00:55:43.020
You know,
and they always talk about the wage gap and all that.

929
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.050
One of the biggest problems with the wage gap is not men.

930
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.800
It's the fact that women don't get together and create businesses enough.

931
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.920
They just don't do it because they're too busy going to look at his bitch and

932
00:55:52.921 --> 00:55:56.430
fucking look at her.
She's too fucking skinny.
She needs to eat something.

933
00:55:56.550 --> 00:56:00.300
She's got on too much fuck out.
She knows what she's doing.
You know,

934
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:04.110
they don't work well together.
I don't know why but that's not our fault.

935
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.480
I'm sure it is.
They'll,
if you watched the video,

936
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.590
I'm sure they could spin it around to us.
So,
um,
yes sir.

937
00:56:10.591 --> 00:56:15.350
I actually absolutely love cooking and um,

938
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:20.100
it isn't the only trick I have up my sleeve.
Um,

939
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.590
I could obviously make more of those.

940
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:26.680
But the thing about it was was that was a specific skill.

941
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:30.970
It was for the holidays and people have suggested,
well,

942
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:33.040
why don't you do one on an hottest smoked meat?
I,

943
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:36.370
why don't you do one about making pasta from scratch?

944
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.700
My thing is because she could watch Mario Batali do it.

945
00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.430
You can watch champion smokers do it.

946
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:47.290
So I guess what makes mine different is that I make it funny.

947
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:48.880
You know,

948
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.330
I just looked at it as a one fucking random thing that I was going to do,

949
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:54.970
but you know,
now that she's been a douche about it,
you know what,

950
00:56:54.971 --> 00:56:59.230
I'll make another one at some point.
I guess I'm,
I'll,
let's see,

951
00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:00.310
what the fuck would I do?

952
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.800
The Turkey pot pie on the big green egg.
I mean,

953
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:07.720
I've watched youtube videos of all of those.

954
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:12.100
I just did a really saw somebody do like,
is there a pie crust video?

955
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.650
I don't know.
I just thought it'd be fun.

956
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:17.230
I literally feel like I'm in a relationship or right now I'm,

957
00:57:17.231 --> 00:57:19.090
I'm sorry that that video annoyed you.

958
00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:26.770
Oh God.
It's so fucking moody.
Yeah,
I will.
I will figure out something else.

959
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:31.210
Um,
to make one of those.
I'll do like one a year

960
00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:35.740
now.
It's actually given me some ideas.
Like maybe I'll do one.
Ah,

961
00:57:35.741 --> 00:57:37.240
the summer's coming.
All right.

962
00:57:37.241 --> 00:57:40.240
You're going to show up to 4th of July is a quick fucking thing you can make.

963
00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.610
You know what?
Maybe I'll do it.
Maybe I'll do it.

964
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:46.270
I just don't like committing to shit like that.
I love not having a job,

965
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:49.840
which is why I'm a fucking comedian.
I really enjoyed this whole,

966
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:53.980
I work when I want to rather than being,
okay,
we need 20 episodes of this.

967
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:58.660
All right.
Thursday afternoon podcast got me laid bill.
Oh,
something positive.

968
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:00.701
Oh,
John,

969
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:05.630
do you really think he could get somebody else laid it's fucking disease.
Um,

970
00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:09.130
it's probably why we die eight years earlier just because they just won't give

971
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:09.460
it up.

972
00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:14.050
But if he get yourself out in front of it next time you wife does that to you,

973
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:16.780
sir.
Next time she takes you out at the knees,

974
00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:21.490
just come up to her and stroke the side of her face.
You know,

975
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.730
when we go out and get a new car and you'd say,
oh honey,

976
00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:26.740
don't you think you're a little bit old for that car?
You know,

977
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:30.250
does one of those things makes you feel stupid,
right?
Just walk up stroke.

978
00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:34.180
The side of her face has golf,
sweetie.
Don't worry.

979
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:39.620
I'm not going to leave you.
It's okay.
Shh.

980
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:44.110
It's okay.
I know I look in the car.
I'm sorry.
Something like that.

981
00:58:44.111 --> 00:58:47.560
Some creepy.
All right bill,
last week on New Year's Eve,

982
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:50.950
my wife and I listened to your podcast after we put the kids to bed,

983
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.910
we drank wine and laughed our asses off.
That's great.
This woke us up,

984
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:58.540
energized us just as to throw back.
Clip came on.

985
00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:03.280
It appeared that we may have sex to ring in the new year.
Well boy,

986
00:59:03.281 --> 00:59:07.840
oh boy.
Not more than a few notes into the outro song.
We were going at it.

987
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:13.350
It was all over just moments after the song and it's so maybe four minutes or so

988
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.190
of ball dropping bliss.
My Dick.

989
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:20.970
Thanks you for the laughs and the soundtrack.

990
00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:25.360
Did you guys fuck to the me on the song?
I don't think I needed to know that.

991
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:29.020
Um,
all right.
Oh here it is.

992
00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:34.220
Here it is.
This is the one I wanted to read.
This is,

993
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:37.860
this is amazing overpopulation myth,
Bill,

994
00:59:37.861 --> 00:59:41.550
how you're doing and I'm just checking in on your,
uh,

995
00:59:41.551 --> 00:59:46.551
to inform you that if you go online and see for yourself how much arable Ara,

996
00:59:49.051 --> 00:59:53.370
B,
l,
e farmland and resources there actually is in the world,

997
00:59:53.371 --> 00:59:58.371
you'll see that there is enough to feed and home at least 100 billion people for

998
00:59:59.521 --> 01:00:03.360
a provable fact.
I Dunno,

999
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.020
that sentence didn't make sense.

1000
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.040
Did you like voice Texas or did you actually,

1001
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:13.070
this is how you actually type out sentences.
Person goes.

1002
01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:17.420
So anytime you hear anyone say that 7 billion people is too many people.

1003
01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.730
Um,
there.

1004
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:21.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1005
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:26.250
<v 1>T h e I r either seriously misinformed and or too lazy to do some research or</v>

1006
01:00:27.911 --> 01:00:29.980
flat out lying through their teeth.

1007
01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.360
Like our so called leaders in scientists must be,
oh yeah,

1008
01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:37.670
they gotta be lying because you know,
you can't even spell there.
Right.

1009
01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:39.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1010
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:42.350
<v 1>Because within one to do two days of research,</v>

1011
01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:45.530
you can find studies that prove what I said.

1012
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:48.680
It's going to take me one to two days to find it on the Internet.

1013
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.770
This is fucking hilarious.
Why did your days,
22 days to research?

1014
01:00:55.771 --> 01:00:59.280
You can find studies that prove what I say is true parentheses,

1015
01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:03.150
at least 100 billion.
Now I know you're in the business

1016
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:04.903
<v 2>of</v>

1017
01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:10.410
<v 1>waking the masses up just like the lake group.
Great.
Bill Hicks.
No,
I'm not.</v>

1018
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:15.390
But do you realize how serious the situation is regarding the distraction of

1019
01:01:15.391 --> 01:01:20.391
brainwashing as organized by big business and they're controlling family owners.

1020
01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.180
So as great as,
I think you and your comedy are mentioning,
overpopulation,

1021
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.340
which is a complete myth,

1022
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.510
is doing them prints these big corporations in the country who own them,

1023
01:01:30.511 --> 01:01:33.960
a big service and adding to the brainwashing.
Anyway,
Bill,

1024
01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:36.840
I know you're a great man because of the subjects you talk about during his

1025
01:01:36.841 --> 01:01:37.170
shows,

1026
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:42.170
but please look for yourself and how much amor arable farmland there is a and

1027
01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:48.720
consider the fact that all food grows completely for free.

1028
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.313
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1029
01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:55.330
<v 1>Wow.
All right,
well I'll tell you this buddy.
I know I'm a moron,</v>

1030
01:01:55.331 --> 01:01:58.600
so I just looked up,
I looked at as how many people can the earth sustain?

1031
01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:00.773
<v 2>MMM.</v>

1032
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:05.510
<v 1>And it says,
uh,
how many people can the earth support?</v>

1033
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:10.430
So 10 billion people is the utmost population limit where food is concerned.

1034
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:11.870
That's the first one.

1035
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:17.470
The next one says more than 7 billion people currently on the planet compared to

1036
01:02:17.481 --> 01:02:18.980
3 billion in 1960.

1037
01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:20.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1038
01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:25.120
<v 1>That one does it say,
oh,
I'll do,
I'll just go on.</v>

1039
01:02:25.121 --> 01:02:26.620
It's a video.
I don't want to watch that.

1040
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1041
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.520
<v 1>Current population is three times the sustainable level.</v>

1042
01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.160
That's a the next article.

1043
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1044
01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.970
<v 1>Um,
how many people can the earth sustain?
I'll click on this one.</v>

1045
01:02:39.971 --> 01:02:43.990
I'm trying to find anything that says anything even remotely close to a hundred

1046
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:47.800
million.
100 billion.
Here's a staggering stat.
According to the United Nations,

1047
01:02:47.801 --> 01:02:50.230
the world's car population of 7.2 billion,

1048
01:02:50.231 --> 01:02:54.970
it's now up to 7.8 is projected to increase by 1 billion over the next 12 years,

1049
01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:59.290
which would bring us to 9.6 billion by 2050.

1050
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:03.400
How can we sustain all these people on the planet or rather how many people can

1051
01:03:03.401 --> 01:03:05.140
this plan is sustained?
That is the question.

1052
01:03:05.141 --> 01:03:07.060
Alan Weissman explored his latest book.

1053
01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:10.720
Count down our last best hope for a future on earth.
Question Mark.

1054
01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.460
Uh,
Jesus Christ,
a bunch of conversations,

1055
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:19.610
bunch of words,
Saba number.

1056
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:23.810
Where is the fucking number?

1057
01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1058
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:28.690
<v 1>Alrighty.
As the charter,
while the others is kind of the next 50 years,</v>

1059
01:03:28.691 --> 01:03:32.350
we will need to produce as much food as it ever been consumed for an entire

1060
01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:35.170
human history.
Well,
that makes sense.
Cause there'll be the most people,

1061
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.800
there'll be the most farts ever in the history of human beings.

1062
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.670
There's no fucking number there,
sir.
All I can tell you is,

1063
01:03:44.671 --> 01:03:48.450
is if you see the environmental damage,

1064
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:52.670
that's 7.8 billion people did.
If you're going to have 100 billion people,
like,

1065
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.650
I mean,
at this point in Africa,
there's barely any land for,
for wild animals.

1066
01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.060
<v 2>Okay?</v>

1067
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:04.010
<v 1>It's all good.
It's all like for the most part down in the southern part of,</v>

1068
01:04:04.011 --> 01:04:07.890
of the country,
uh,
it's all like roped off.

1069
01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:09.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1070
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:12.230
<v 1>It's finite.
You know what I mean?
They're completely surrounded.</v>

1071
01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:17.920
I'd have to say that I disagree and not just by your spelling,

1072
01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:19.840
because I couldn't read half the fucking words you said,

1073
01:04:19.841 --> 01:04:21.550
even when you spelled them.
Right.
But yeah,
no,

1074
01:04:21.551 --> 01:04:23.410
there's no fucking way 100 billion people

1075
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.400
and there's any sort of animal life left that isn't stuck in a cage.

1076
01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:30.600
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1077
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.150
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Um,</v>

1078
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.320
and also in this last year I traveled to Singapore,
Hong Kong and Mumbai,

1079
01:04:37.321 --> 01:04:41.550
India.
And I saw what that next level of population looked like too.

1080
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:46.560
And I was breathing that air that's Singapore.
Singapore was,

1081
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:50.400
was different.
Um,
but Hong Kong and Mumbai,
India,

1082
01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:54.050
you could almost taste the fucking air and it was just,
uh,

1083
01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:55.970
<v 2>okay.</v>

1084
01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:57.920
<v 1>It was just way too many fucking people.
I can,</v>

1085
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:59.990
I can tell you that there's no way 100 billion people.

1086
01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.140
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1087
01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.200
<v 1>And I don't understand why I need to look it up for one to two days.</v>

1088
01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:09.570
Why could you just send me a link?
I would love for you to be right.
But uh,

1089
01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.830
I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're not a,

1090
01:05:12.831 --> 01:05:16.270
I'm going to go with the scientist on this one.
And also this also sounds like,

1091
01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.420
you know,
when people denied global warming,

1092
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:19.970
<v 2>okay.</v>

1093
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:24.140
<v 1>Not to get all political,
but one political party adamantly denied it.</v>

1094
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:25.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1095
01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.380
<v 1>For years and years and years and now they've decades and now they finally just</v>

1096
01:05:28.381 --> 01:05:32.160
go,
yeah,
we are causing climate change,
but you know what,
it's too late now.

1097
01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.720
So I imagine that that's what's we're going to do out here.

1098
01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:40.500
We have a fucking methane gas leak that's been going on and I guess that's,

1099
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.670
it's like 10 times worse than carbon dioxide as far as getting put into the

1100
01:05:44.671 --> 01:05:45.780
fucking,
uh,

1101
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:49.980
atmosphere as far as heating it up and all that were completely fucked.

1102
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.120
We're fucked.
We're absolutely fucked.
Um,

1103
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:58.940
and selfishly,
I hope I,
it doesn't happen by the end of my own life,

1104
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.020
which is the exact sort of thought process that got us into this mess to begin

1105
01:06:03.021 --> 01:06:03.950
with.
But sir,
you're,

1106
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.920
you're correct in assuming that I'm a fucking dope and I don't know what I'm

1107
01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:07.850
talking about,
but,
uh,

1108
01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.380
<v 2>okay.</v>

1109
01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.490
<v 1>I've just kinda going with,
having traveled extensively,</v>

1110
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.110
you know,

1111
01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:20.110
for the last 20 years on the road and watching the population increased just in

1112
01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:22.880
this country.
Um,

1113
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.360
<v 2>okay.</v>

1114
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:28.080
<v 1>It's a weird thing where the population keeps looking like it's sort of leveled</v>

1115
01:06:28.081 --> 01:06:28.914
off.

1116
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:30.580
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1117
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.950
<v 1>And I don't know if because there's no factories anymore.</v>

1118
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:36.400
All I know is like I've,
I,
I've used to be back in the day,

1119
01:06:36.401 --> 01:06:39.100
if I jumped on the highway at two in the afternoon,
I was good.

1120
01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:40.750
And now everywhere I go there's like traffic.

1121
01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:43.060
And I'm just looking at these people going like,
you guys all stand up,

1122
01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:45.340
comics does.
Everybody worked the third shift,

1123
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.040
how the fuck are all these people out on the road?
I didn't know what's going on.

1124
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:49.340
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1125
01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.190
<v 1>Do a lot of people work from home and they're all driving out to get a sandwich</v>

1126
01:06:52.191 --> 01:06:55.360
at that time?
I don't know.
You know what?
Let me look up.

1127
01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.790
I heard the u s population,
it's kind of leveled off,
which has excited me.

1128
01:06:58.791 --> 01:06:59.900
That's exciting to me.
You know,

1129
01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.950
U s population.

1130
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.983
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1131
01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:10.260
<v 1>Oh Jesus Christ.
Or can you fucking population</v>

1132
01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:15.640
by year?
Let's do this.
All right,
let's see what we got here.

1133
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:21.070
US population by year.
Uh,

1134
01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:21.904
right.

1135
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:27.180
Let's go back to 1997 there was 2.726 5 million and now there's 322.0 7 million.

1136
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.020
So it's gone up by like 50 million.

1137
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:40.300
Is that enough to notice what's actually,
you know,
that's significant.

1138
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:41.703
Right?

1139
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:42.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1140
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:47.050
<v 1>That's like a 20% increase.
I think I make it a point.</v>

1141
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:52.300
All right,
let's move on here.
All right.
Uh,
advice,
changing high schools.

1142
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:53.801
Dear Belle,

1143
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:56.830
I'm a freshman in high school and would like to know your perspective on my

1144
01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:57.664
situation.

1145
01:07:57.790 --> 01:08:01.840
I currently attended a performing arts high school and Major in jazz studies.

1146
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:05.410
That's fucking cool.
I enjoy it and all but this,
uh,

1147
01:08:05.411 --> 01:08:06.970
the first semester has passed.

1148
01:08:07.210 --> 01:08:11.200
I found out that jazz is something I don't want to do in life rather than,

1149
01:08:11.201 --> 01:08:13.810
than carry on food.
The next three years of this major,

1150
01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:18.680
I'd rather change and major in something that would benefit me in the long run,

1151
01:08:18.681 --> 01:08:22.760
especially if I want to attend big schools like Harvard.

1152
01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.550
Uh,
well let's go ahead,
man.
You tried something you can give,

1153
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:26.970
give realized early on,
you know,

1154
01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:30.200
like it and he got enough strength to be like I to communicate it.

1155
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:34.340
I don't want to do this.
Anyone needs something else?
It's all good so far.
Uh,

1156
01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:36.860
the problem is that in leaving my current school,

1157
01:08:36.861 --> 01:08:41.861
I could possibly devastate the bands I'm in Jesus.

1158
01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.310
They came in and ego out of nowhere and also hurt some friends.

1159
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.270
My director has placed me in some good bands and I even get paid money for

1160
01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:50.780
playing gay.

1161
01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:55.780
I'll see a crushing it outfield shell road to leave my director as he has put me

1162
01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:59.990
in a position that many others would gladly take.

1163
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:03.350
This question has been tearing me apart for a while.
What do you think,
Bill?

1164
01:09:03.351 --> 01:09:06.230
Should I stay or should I go?
Also,
if I do decide to leave,

1165
01:09:06.231 --> 01:09:08.740
do you think I should tell my friends and directors that I,

1166
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:13.160
that I am or should I just go out quietly?
I'm thrilled you have to do in life.

1167
01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:16.310
What makes you happy?
If you try and make other people happy,

1168
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:18.830
that's all you're going to do and you're not going to be happy and then you're

1169
01:09:18.831 --> 01:09:20.180
going to be miserable to be around.

1170
01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:23.150
You're going turn it to a bitter person who didn't do what they wanted to do in

1171
01:09:23.151 --> 01:09:25.670
life and no one wants to be around that guy.
All right.

1172
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.660
So as much as it's gonna hurt them,
uh,

1173
01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.870
you got to leave and you got to tell them and you have to tell them why you're

1174
01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:35.360
going to leave and just say,
listen,
I'm just not happy doing this.

1175
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.950
I understand that I'm lucky.

1176
01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.530
And then a lot of people would kill to be in my position.

1177
01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:44.660
So I feel that someone should at least be happy.

1178
01:09:44.661 --> 01:09:46.660
It'd be excited,
you know,

1179
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.540
if many people desire to be in my position and I'm occupying that position and

1180
01:09:50.541 --> 01:09:55.220
I'm not happy,
I'm doing an injustice to myself and one of you guys.
All right,

1181
01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:59.140
I apologize.
I'm sorry.
And then that's it.
And you know what?

1182
01:09:59.141 --> 01:10:02.630
It's a great life lessons.
Sometimes.
You know,
when you ask for what you want,

1183
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:06.750
people get hurt.
And uh,
you know,
I don't mean you physically have to hurt him,

1184
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:11.630
you know,
the bottom lip quivers a little bit.
That's all I'm saying.
Um,
that's it.

1185
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.920
But don't go out quietly.
Don't sneak out the backdoor.

1186
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.230
Be a man or woman about it and fucking,
you know,

1187
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:20.810
being an adult.
All right.
And that's it.

1188
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:24.990
And he should be commended for understanding that you don't like something and,

1189
01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.210
and not just staying in it.
All right.
Book recommendations.
All right.
Hey Bill,

1190
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:33.170
I'm not to start off by blowing smoke up your ass,

1191
01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:38.171
but f f F is for family is a phenomenal show as me cracking up nonstop.

1192
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.540
But I digressed.
Well thank you.
I appreciate that.

1193
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.550
Gives me a chance to promote the show.
If you haven't watched yet,

1194
01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:45.050
please check out.
F is for family.

1195
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:50.300
Evidently we're doing great on the old Netflix Day.
Uh,

1196
01:10:50.301 --> 01:10:55.160
this person says,
I remember you mentioned you read
open,
oh,

1197
01:10:55.161 --> 01:10:58.850
that you read opened by Andre Agassi.
So I picked it up and started reading it.

1198
01:10:59.060 --> 01:10:59.811
It truly is.

1199
01:10:59.811 --> 01:11:04.100
One of the books that's tough to put down was wondering if he had any other

1200
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:08.110
recommendations that you've read of late.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
Uh,

1201
01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.870
that comedian book that I mentioned,
um,
I have it downstairs.
Uh,

1202
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.200
it's like the history stand up comedy.
Let me look it up here.
Uh,

1203
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.520
which is taking me forever to get through.
Cause every time they bring up a name,

1204
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:21.900
I'm like,
who the fuck is that guy?

1205
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:24.870
And then I look them up and then I'm on the Internet.
But it's been a,

1206
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:26.820
it's been a joy,

1207
01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:32.860
the history of stand up comedy book.

1208
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:40.320
There it is.
All right.
This is what I've been reading.
It's called the Comedians,

1209
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:45.180
uh,
drunk Steve scoundrels and the history of American comedy.

1210
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:50.700
Jesus Christ.
How about brilliance?
Do you know any geniuses in there?
No.
Nothing.

1211
01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:54.510
No nod to Pryor,
Lenny Bruce,
none of that.
All right.

1212
01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:00.120
Um,
yeah,
so I would,
that's what I've been reading and uh,

1213
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:00.930
I dunno,

1214
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:04.180
I'm in another one of those modes when I'm just playing a lot of drums and I'm

1215
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.130
cooking in that type of stuff.
And uh,

1216
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:10.320
also feeling the pressure to put out into the cooking video to shut up somebody

1217
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:13.600
that I'd never met before.
How fucking ridiculous is that?
Um,

1218
01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:17.850
I should just let it go.
You know,
I should,
but you know what,
I'm not gonna.

1219
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.540
You know what?
Maybe I'll make a fuck.
I'll make a breakfast one.
I made a pie one,

1220
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.820
I'll make a breakfast one.
I'll make a lunch one.

1221
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.120
I'll make a delta or a supper one.

1222
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:31.890
I'll do it all throughout the fucking years.
All right,
Dan.

1223
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:36.210
Appeal basic cooking by a basic client.
All right.
Debts,

1224
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:40.200
the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1225
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.260
Um,
it's a brand new year.

1226
01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:48.120
I have like two standup gigs booked because I'm trying to figure out what the

1227
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:51.210
fuck is going to go on with this show for going to get a second season.

1228
01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:55.650
I need to know,
but uh,
I think I'm just going to start booking shit.
Um,

1229
01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:00.270
cause that's how this business works.
You know,
if you,
uh,

1230
01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:03.000
do you poke a bunch of shit,
then they just go,

1231
01:13:03.001 --> 01:13:05.610
oh well let's fucking give you something right in the middle of all that other

1232
01:13:05.611 --> 01:13:07.800
shit that you booked.
If you don't book anything,

1233
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.770
then you just going to be staring at your phone and it's never going to ring.

1234
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:15.630
What are you fucking which billion to sue units?
Superstitious stuff.
Well,

1235
01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:17.880
maybe I am,
I have no idea.
But,
uh,

1236
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:23.270
Paul Versey is going to try to not drink starting today until the beginning of

1237
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:25.490
April.
And I told him that I would,

1238
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:30.420
I've sorta halfass committed that I would do it with them.
Um,

1239
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.130
so I'm sort of on the wagon right now.
I didn't drink last night.

1240
01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.510
I don't really have any desire to do it today.
I'm fucking wiped out,

1241
01:13:39.511 --> 01:13:44.130
so we'll see.
I'm going to try and see.
I'll try and go as long as they can.
Uh,

1242
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:46.260
all right.
That's it.
Go Fuck Yourself.
So talk to you on Thursday.
