3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.820
February 11th,
2019.

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.500
What is going on with you?
How are you?

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.820
Um,
I am actually recording part of this anyways,

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.650
I'll rerecording here Saturday night cause I'm out here tour and doing a little

7
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:27.651
bit of stand up and just when I have to fly on Sunday and then I got a fucking

8
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:33.130
bunch of Shit I have to do Monday.
I gotta I gotta do this as spurts.

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.900
<v 0>They got to do a couple of rounds here.
You know,
it's weird.</v>

11
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.940
I've been walking around today all by myself,
all by my lonesome and uh,

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for some reason I don't know why this fucking melody with the wrong lyrics has

13
00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:51.070
been stuck in my head.

14
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.000
I just been walking around going Sherry's berries.

15
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.190
Why your buggin?

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.450
<v 0>Makes no fucking sense whatsoever.</v>

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.220
I never had a song.
I always had a song from me undies be undies.

19
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.290
So Sherry's berries
keeps that they might have advertised,

20
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.870
advertise this can,
we gave no idea.
I'm doing this so early,

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.480
I don't even have the advertising yet.
You understand?

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.270
You understand how dangerous a podcast this is right now?
Um,

23
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.800
any ways,
any way,
I guess,
as I've been told I'm supposed to say and said.

24
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.680
Anyways,
anyway,
I'm fucking,
uh,

25
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.790
I did my first stand up road gig and since I came back from Europe,
uh,

26
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.710
ended the acting Gig and I walked out on stage,

27
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:44.480
got on the fucking bicycle and it was a,
it was all right.
Everything went great.

28
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:49.481
I want to thank everybody came out to the Borgata in Atlantic city.

29
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:52.810
I had a great fucking time.
And uh,

30
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.760
now I'm sort of barnstorming around just doing some like,
you know,

31
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.990
clubs and local areas and shit just still in the hour and trying to figure out

32
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:04.970
how I'm going to put this fucking thing together.
A widdle,
some shit down,
get in,

33
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.910
get out,
tape this fucking thing and then move on to my next hour.

34
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:09.410
My favorite fucking thing to do,

35
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.250
my favorite fucking thing to do is,
is the,

36
00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:19.640
is the day after the special when all that material is flushed down the fucking

37
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:23.300
toilet and I get to start over again.
No fucking pressure.

38
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.960
You know the precious to special.

39
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.980
Once you get the special done,
you know,
if you like me,

40
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:33.920
you're going to continue to like fuck up in life.

41
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:37.560
So the material is going to come,
you know,

42
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.000
speaking of fucking up,
I was staying in this hotel about a week ago.

43
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.750
I forgot to tell you the story.
So fucking,

44
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.670
I swear to God like the level

45
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.370
<v 1>okay</v>

46
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.870
<v 0>of like hostile</v>

47
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.290
that corporations have got to as far as just complete lack of customer service.

48
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.900
He can't get anybody on the fucking phone.

49
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.910
Total skeleton crew go fuck yourself.
The the,

50
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.510
the way this,
this shit is now.
You know what I mean?

51
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.490
Like if you have a problem with you fucking iPhone,

52
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.660
who the hell are you going to call?

53
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.410
How the fuck you going to get anybody on the phone

54
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.140
or at least to somebody in front of them this fucking hemisphere,

55
00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:25.140
you can't do it right.
So last couple of hotels I stay in,
right?

56
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.130
I go to call room service.
How long should that take?

57
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.760
Two,
three fucking rings.
Worst case scenario,

58
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:35.730
they usually have an outgoing message going like,
hey,
if we reached his message,

59
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.880
just leave your room number and we will,
uh,

60
00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:41.760
we'll call you right back and we'll figure out what,
what,
what,
whatever you want.

61
00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:42.594
Right?

62
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.020
So a fucking call this the Goddamn thing rings three times.

63
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.380
Puts me on hold.
I put it on speaker.

64
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:56.400
I'm sitting there for like 15 fucking minutes.
So I hang up like,
all right,

65
00:03:56.401 --> 00:04:00.090
so I fucking called the front desk and I was like,
yeah,
Hey,

66
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:04.500
I'm trying to order the Reuben,
the Reuben Sandwich there,
right?

67
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.280
I can't get through and nobody's picking up.
The lady at the front desk is like,

68
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.120
oh,
that's strange.
Here,
let me,
let me,
I'll put you right through.

69
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.540
Puts me through to the same extension on,
back on hold again,

70
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:17.070
listening to the same fucking music.

71
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.400
Sit there again for another 10 minutes now about 25 minutes and just trying to

72
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:21.540
order a fucking sandwich.

73
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.313
<v 1>All right,</v>

74
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.210
<v 0>so then I go,
I fucked this.
I go to the next phone.</v>

75
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.600
I called customer service is a customer service button.

76
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.410
So many picks up after three rings.
I tell him what the fucking problem is.

77
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.420
He said,
oh my God,
it's terrible.
I'm so sorry,
Mr. Burn.
Uh,
you know,
I'll,

78
00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:42.780
I'll let me,
let,
let me get you through.
I'll stay on with you.
Right.

79
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.430
Same fucking extension.
Same fucking on hold music.

80
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.740
And I'm sitting there for like 15 seconds and I'm like,
wait.
I'm like,
Dude,

81
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.090
you still there?
He wasn't there,

82
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.720
so I fucking call back customer service again.
Somebody else picks up.

83
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.223
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

84
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.420
<v 0>I see.
I tell the whole fucking story.
They just told you,
it's like the nighttime.</v>

85
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.640
I'm telling this story,
I feel front desk to fucking cut third time.
Right.

86
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.730
And as I'm telling it,
she goes,
eat in,
stay on with you.
And I'm like,
no.

87
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.630
Like is that normal behavior?
She goes,
I'm sorry.
All right,

88
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:26.620
let me get you through.
And she finally gets me through.
Okay,

89
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.630
so room service.

90
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.880
It rings in the guy on the other end picks up room service and just goes,

91
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.680
hello?
I'm like,

92
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.560
yeah.
Ah,
is this rum service?
He's like,
yeah,

93
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.070
unlike a,
I'd like to order some food to the room.
It's like super awkward.

94
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:55.150
And he goes,
all right.
I go,
okay,
can I get that Reuben Sandwich?

95
00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.550
He's like,
Yup.
I go,
all right,
can I get a side salad?

96
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.630
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

97
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.660
<v 0>instead of the fries,
is it all right if I get a salad instead of the fries?</v>

98
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.690
And he goes,
no
flat out says no,

99
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.390
no.
What am I going to do?
Complain to him.
He's got my food,

100
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:17.200
he's got me by the balls.
So I was like,
okay,
I,
you know,

101
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:20.580
I guess I'm eating fries.
He's like,
well what do you,
what do you want to drink?

102
00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:22.470
I just go,
let me get a water with ice.

103
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.180
<v 0>See it goes all right.
So you know,</v>

105
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.100
get in the room number and I fucking hang up.

106
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.640
<v 0>And then I just sit there,
walk around with fucking hotel room,</v>

108
00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:37.440
muttering to myself.
God,
it literally took me a fucking half hour

109
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.720
to get through to somebody they could get me to somebody to order a fucking

110
00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:43.890
sandwich to my room.

111
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.940
<v 0>And then when I asked,
you know,
have it your way,
Burger King,</v>

113
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:53.350
he basically was like,
yeah,
no,
go.
Fuck.
He's like,
I was his kid.
Daddy.

114
00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:56.130
Can we get some ice cream now?
All right.

115
00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.050
I guess you're taller than me and you're driving and you're paying for

116
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.420
everything.
So I guess what you say goes,

117
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.190
this guy's fucking talking to me like that.

118
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.890
So now I'm in another hotel
and uh,

119
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:10.300
I wanted to find out,
I don't know what,

120
00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:14.220
there was a vending machine on this fucking floor and I'm trying to fund the,

121
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.300
there's no button on the phone that says front desk.

122
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.790
<v 0>And this is feeling like a trend where I've noticed,
you know,</v>

124
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:26.180
you go into your room,
if there's no menu,
you call him up.

125
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.800
If he can get somebody on the phone,
where's the menu?
They say it's on your TV.

126
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.070
And then you go on the TV and you got to use,

127
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.620
figure out your fucking remote control.
It's all on you.

128
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:40.240
You have to figure it out.

129
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.220
<v 0>Right.</v>

131
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.220
And you've got to figure this shit out and then order it without talking to

132
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.083
anybody.

133
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

134
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.540
<v 0>MMM.
Like how far are they going to take this?</v>

135
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.880
I feel like in the future,
like you're going to be like,

136
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.520
especially in this country with the fucking healthcare,

137
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.990
you're going to be like Diana's something and it's going to be up to you to

138
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:02.900
figure out like how to get ahold of somebody

139
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.140
and I don't know what,
you know if,
yeah.
Yeah.
Hey,
uh,

140
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:14.100
I got stabbed in the abdomen.
Okay.
Yeah,

141
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:15.930
I was wondering if I could get some,
uh,

142
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.450
room servers if you could like drive an ambulance over here.

143
00:08:18.451 --> 00:08:23.220
Maybe like pick me up.
I,
yeah.
Can you,

No,

145
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.190
I,
well it was the ambulance going to show up?
Yeah,

146
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.600
It's going to be like,
like that level is shit.
I Dunno.

147
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

148
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.240

149
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.260

You work here.
Okay.
You don't like the job?

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.950

You're going to suck.

155
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.100

Oh I got another good one.
I hope I'm,</v>

157
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.760
I'm assuming you enjoyed that story is another travel story for you.

158
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.370
So I'm on my way to Atlantic city.
Right.

159
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

160
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.420
<v 0>And I uh,
I get on the plane and I'm sitting there and I just,</v>

161
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.030
as I'm sitting there,
I'm looking down.
I Dunno what the fuck I'm doing.

162
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.480
Reading a magazine is some shit.

163
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.110
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.030
<v 0>And uh,
I was reading rolling stone.
Hey,</v>

165
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.720
this guy going bill burr.
Bill.
Hey Bill.

Hey Bill.

166
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.650

Shit.
Hey,

167
00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:42.560

He's like,

I was like,
no,

168
00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:46.880
I'm landing there and I'm going to fucking drive over to Atlantic city.
He goes,

169
00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:50.620
oh cool.
I'll talk to you when we get off right side and seen him in awhile.

170
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.960
I'm not gonna name any names here cause I don't want to get anybody in fucking

171
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:56.690
trouble.
Right?
So we get off the fucking get off the plane.
All right,

172
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.020
take a leak and come out.
He's fucking Stan.
Hey,
what's going on?

173
00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:02.420
So we start shooting the shit and we're walking.

174
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.693
<v 2>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.880
<v 0>And we get to the uh,</v>

176
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.000
<v 2>okay.</v>

177
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.060
<v 0>You know the moving sidewalk.
We hadn't seen each other a little bit.</v>

178
00:10:10.061 --> 00:10:11.560
We were standing side by side,

179
00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:16.561
but you're not supposed to cause it's walk or stand to this guy as he's walking

180
00:10:17.501 --> 00:10:19.510
up,
it's going,
excuse me,
excuse me.

181
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.370
Like he only had to say it once and we immediately immediately got out of the

182
00:10:24.371 --> 00:10:26.830
way and it comes huffin buys,

183
00:10:26.831 --> 00:10:30.700
he walks by and then he points up at the sign that says walk or stand.

184
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.640
So I just was like,
I got hit buddy.
Relax.

185
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

186
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.080
<v 0>He's walking away.
He goes,
you relaxed.
I go,
you're the one pointed at the sign.</v>

187
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.460
He started talking more shit.
And I go,
Oh yeah,
I get it.
I get it.
Yeah,

188
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.070
you got your ear buds in your important,
right.

189
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:52.410
So he starts giving me shit and I just started saying it turn around every now

190
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:54.480
and then I get a little bit.
So you know,

191
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.280
cause he was listening to and I made him so mad.
He gave me the finger.

192
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.240
It was like the highlight of my fucking trip

193
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:09.130
that was already in a bad mood because the second we landed some cont like five

194
00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:14.131
rows back immediately turned on the cell phone and had like a conversation at

195
00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:15.970
the top of his lungs.
You know,

196
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.390
and I know there's something weird about this where in that story,

197
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.530
the middle story,

198
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.980
I was the con cause I was standing where you were supposed to be walking.

199
00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:26.680
But the thing is the second the guy said,
excuse me,

200
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.190
I knew what I was doing wrong and I immediately got out of the fucking way.

201
00:11:30.191 --> 00:11:32.110
I didn't act,
you know,
I immediately got out of the way.

202
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.450
This guy's still shaking his fucking head.

203
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.773
<v 2>Ah.</v>

204
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.920
<v 0>I was just looking at the guy like who the fuck are you to behave like me in</v>

205
00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:45.760
that situation?
You know the nervous some people

206
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.030
who are you to walk by mad at me that I wasn't aware that you were trying.

207
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.230
This is the thing he really,
even in a fucking

208
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.870
<v 3>hurry,
cause he had the time to argue with me and give me the finger.</v>

209
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.850
He's just one of those fucking people that just has to walk fast,
um,

210
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.450
until they feel like they're getting somewhere.
I don't know.
By the way,

211
00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:06.290
I've got to tell you something.

212
00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:11.060
Those stupid little fucking little half a straws that people have hanging out of

213
00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:14.810
their fucking ears.
It's just,
you know,
that's like the Bluetooth headphones.

214
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.650
I think I'm very soon people are going to get there.

215
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.750
That's going to become like,

216
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:23.570
remember like Bluetooth was cool for like a week evidently.

217
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.840
And then everybody just made fun of that stupid thing hanging out of your ear.

218
00:12:26.841 --> 00:12:30.560
I really think that those,
whatever those things are called,
I have no idea.

219
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.790
It always looks like you have it like a little bit,

220
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:36.530
little straw hanging out of your fucking year.
Um,
I'm not a fan of those.

221
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.040
I've always been a fan of headphones.
I don't like,

222
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.450
my ears are fucked from playing drums and I don't like jam and shit into my ear.

223
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.430
Um,
I dunno.
Plus,
you know what,

224
00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:51.080
if you ever gotten like bright light tank right there.

225
00:12:51.081 --> 00:12:52.790
What if we got into a fight,
right?

226
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.140
Me and that guy and I fucking throw a hook and I punched him right in the year

227
00:12:57.141 --> 00:13:00.170
and then that then goes into his ear,
you know,

228
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.210
and then for the rest of his life,

229
00:13:02.211 --> 00:13:05.330
he's listening to fucking blondie or something in one of his ears.

230
00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:09.830
They can't get it out of her punches.
His ear drum is,
and I get sued,
you know,

231
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:15.470
all because I wanted to say hello to a comic.
Okay.
Do you understand that people,

232
00:13:15.471 --> 00:13:19.580
that's how quick it can happen.
That's how quickly you can lose your hearing.

233
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.953
<v 4>MMM.</v>

234
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.200
<v 3>By the way,
you know what's really fucking underrated?
A Old Lady Card Games.</v>

235
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.240
I sat down with a relative of mine this past week,

236
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.700
there was a deck of cards there.
Right.
I had like a little family reunion.
Yeah.

237
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.210
<v 4>Dang right.
And uh,</v>

238
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.200
<v 3>one of my relatives,
she's a little bit older or whatever.
I was just like,
hey,</v>

239
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:46.440
you want,
you want to play Gin rummy?

240
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.000
And she was like,
yeah,
she proceeded to kick my ass for like the next hour.

241
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:54.210
But we weren't on our smartphones,
weren't watching TV,

242
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.470
weren't doing anything.
We were just sitting there,
you know,

243
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.150
talking about the old days,
laughing,
having a good time,
giving each other shit,

244
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.460
trying to remember how to keep score

245
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.320
<v 4>and um,</v>

246
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.630
<v 3>I dunno,
I,
I guy really got allows sitting there going like,
you know,</v>

247
00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:16.370
that's one of the coolest hangs I've had with this particular relative in a long

248
00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:17.204
fucking time.

249
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.393
<v 4>MMM.</v>

250
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.060
<v 3>I Dunno.
It made me kind of think like,
you know what,
I should,</v>

251
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.770
I need to bring that into my life.

252
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.413
<v 4>You know,</v>

253
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.360
<v 3>my kid is going to be hilarious.</v>

254
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.660
She's going to be like totally have this time.

255
00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:38.430
And then like know how to drive like

256
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:45.120
a Ford f 103 on the tree.
She's going to know how to play Old Lady Card Games.

257
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:49.350
I figured like I'll all this shit that's fucking good from back in the day,

258
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.060
at least what I consider I'm going to teach her how

259
00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.730
<v 0>to do,
um,
old school shit,</v>

260
00:14:54.731 --> 00:14:58.600
like knowing how to cook as opposed to just doing the Postmates Shit,

261
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.560
you know,
you know,
whether she wants to do it or whatever,

262
00:15:02.561 --> 00:15:05.560
she'll know how to do it,
you know what I mean?
Um,

263
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.730
I dunno
and me immediately think like,

264
00:15:11.731 --> 00:15:16.731
what if I just converted my entire garage into like a cigar bar and had friends

265
00:15:16.921 --> 00:15:21.360
over for over.
We played cards.
I had a smokey eat or so we could smoke inside.

266
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.951
Then I'm like,
well,

267
00:15:22.951 --> 00:15:26.400
I can't fucking do that because then I'll fucking die of throat and mouth cancer

268
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.760
because it'll just be too God damn fun.
You know what I mean?
It's weird.

269
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.120
It's a really weird thing being an adult,
you know?

270
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.090
And it's also even more weird figuring it out at 50.

271
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.233
<v 4>MMM.</v>

272
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.660
<v 0>Does she have that thing?
When all of a sudden,
you know,</v>

273
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:44.240
I guess you go away to college or you just move out and you're like,
okay,

274
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:48.600
my parents aren't here anymore.
Now I can do whatever the fuck I want and

275
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.590
you do whatever the fuck you want for a while and then you just start paying for

276
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:59.570
it.
And uh,
I've kind of been learning this really at my age,

277
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.600
there's nothing better than going to bed sober and having eight hours of

278
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:09.890
uninterrupted sleep.
If I do that

279
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.980
and wake up,
stretch and then go to the gym,

280
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.230
I feel like,
like 15 years younger than I said,
I feel like I'm in my thirties.

281
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.160
Like it's fucking ridiculous.
Now having said that,

282
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.160
I plan to go back to booze,
you know,
at some point.

283
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.870
But I just,
uh,

284
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.330
I got to get through taping my special and then there's an outside chance I have

285
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:42.100
another acting gig coming up and uh,
you know,

286
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:46.540
cause you never know.
Now Jesus Christ do you have no fucking idea.

287
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.810
You know,
you speak back in the day,
if you,
if you will,

288
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:54.280
on something this far into where I'm at with this deal.
You were in there,

289
00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:55.690
but not nowadays.
You know,

290
00:16:55.691 --> 00:17:00.160
one fucking tweet or somebody reads some shit from fucking,
you know,

291
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.610
somebody pulls out a yearbook from the 80s.
I mean,
you know,

292
00:17:03.611 --> 00:17:06.500
you don't know what can happen.
You don't know what's in there.
You don't,

293
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.350
you don't know what the fuck other people have done.

294
00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:12.670
And all it takes is one principle fucking person.

295
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.010
You know,
there's some fucking,
you know,

296
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.970
VHS tape of him kicking a pigeon in the fucking beacon and then the whole

297
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:23.870
fucking thing goes away.
So I don't know.
Um,
so anyways,

298
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:26.020
so there is a thing that I always like,
you know,

299
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.860
I've always wanted to go an entire calendar year,

300
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.890
January 1st through December 31st and not drink and just be like,

301
00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:37.750
I didn't drink that year.
So I think,
uh,

302
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.030
I think this might be the year,
I don't know.
It's already cruising by.

303
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.360
I'm like fucking 11 weeks in already.
You know,
what's the point of stopping?

304
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.210
By the time I take my special,
that'd be another three weeks.
That's 14 weeks.

305
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.340
52 weeks in a year.
52 minus 14,
38 weeks to go.

306
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

307
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.100
<v 0>I'm not,
I'm going to,
I can't make it through that.
I think I can do it.
Um,</v>

308
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.260
but anyways,
what the fuck else did I want to talk about?

309
00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:08.510
I'm actually sitting here now,
late night,

310
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.160
just did a spot and uh,
um,

311
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.510
I'm watching showtime boxing.
You know,

312
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.940
it's weird.
I,
I didn't realize HBO,

313
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.470
like let go with a box box,
oops,
sorry.

314
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.660
Boxing after all of these years.
And then on top of that,

315
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.960
uh,
Jim Lampley is gone.

316
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.440
So they still got that Al Bernstein guy or whatever,
I don't know.

317
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.380
But they got all these new announcers and shit.
So it's a weird transition,

318
00:18:42.381 --> 00:18:44.060
you know what I mean?
It's like when you're a kid,

319
00:18:44.061 --> 00:18:49.061
like the voices of it is as big a part as,

320
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.000
as watching it.
So it just takes a while.
Like,
well,
I gotta be honest with you,

321
00:18:53.001 --> 00:18:55.370
like this transition of,
um,

322
00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.230
new announcers in the NFL really took me a while.

323
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.023
Um,

324
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.680
and that's why I'm loving Tony Romo cause he's like the greatest,
like,

325
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.850
like all my [inaudible] God,
this guy like Tony Roma's still in his thirties,

326
00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:10.091
right?

327
00:19:10.091 --> 00:19:14.200
Like this guy can announce for like another 30 fucking years in the level that

328
00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:18.730
he knows the game is.
This is like,
it's a great thing,
you know,
cause Al Michaels,

329
00:19:18.731 --> 00:19:22.770
I mean,
Al Michaels is good.
I'm glad to be what like in his seventies,
you know,

330
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.300
and uh,

331
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.750
<v 1>okay.</v>

332
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.300
<v 0>Just those voices that I grew,
I,
I'm so old.</v>

333
00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:33.270
Like I remember the end of curt Gowdy.
Um,

334
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.430
there was,
uh,

335
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.210
pat Summerall and um,

336
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.990
John Madden for the longest time,
dawn crickey,

337
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:48.480
all of these guys and just their voices were just football.

338
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.800
Um,
I wish I could have,
I should have looked up some more of a,
uh,
well,

339
00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:57.270
what's his face?
He just passed recently.
Can see his face.

340
00:19:57.271 --> 00:20:01.530
He's the host a game show.
Oh my God,
I'm the fucking worst.

341
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.530
The fuck did I forget his name?
I Dunno.
Whatever.

342
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:07.790
These guys were all the voices of it.
So anyway,

343
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:12.700
so now I'm watching a box in here.
I'm like,
they join the boxing,

344
00:20:12.701 --> 00:20:16.150
but I'm like these voices,
like who the fuck are these people talking?
Man?

345
00:20:16.151 --> 00:20:18.730
It's just,
it's a weird thing.
It's like when your favorite bag,

346
00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:23.030
it's like a new lead singer or something.
Right.
Okay.
So let's just say CDC,

347
00:20:23.031 --> 00:20:26.240
somehow DC was able to do it.
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.

348
00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:28.850
All I know is this right?
Is right around the time.

349
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

350
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.810
<v 0>When I would start doing advertising,
but I don't have any advertising yet.</v>

351
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.100
So let's see,
what else did I want to talk about?
Maybe I'll,
I'll,

352
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.900
I'll record the advertising after.
Maybe I'll do something like that.

353
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.730
Oh,
I got one for you.
Oh,
I'm watching the boxing by the way.
The boxing,

354
00:20:46.731 --> 00:20:47.564
that's how old I am.

355
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.963
<v 4>MMM.</v>

356
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.390
<v 0>I'm watching boxing in the,
uh,</v>

357
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:53.620
<v 4>okay.</v>

358
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.870
<v 0>You know what's funny is the UFC is so fucking destroyed.</v>

359
00:20:56.871 --> 00:21:00.350
This sport fucking destroyed this sport.
Well,

360
00:21:00.351 --> 00:21:05.351
they were destroying themselves with the corruption in people ducking fights and

361
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.780
just bad decisions and all of that.

362
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.510
Basically throughout my whole fucking life.

363
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:12.820
<v 4>Okay.</v>

364
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.550
<v 0>But they have so destroyed them,
but you know,
it's fun.</v>

365
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:18.040
I shouldn't even bring this up or it's just funny to me.

366
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.410
Nobody's really paying attention to it.

367
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.680
So like when the ring girls get in the crowd,

368
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.090
there's still all these people going

369
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.640
when fucking whistle in and shit like a fucking bugs bunny cartoon.

370
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:33.670
They all you're doing is not barking like a dog and stomp on their foot on the

371
00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:37.960
fucking floor.
You know what I mean?
But as I've always maintained,
like when it,

372
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:40.250
when it comes to this getting offended shit,

373
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.680
it has to be something big enough that they'll waste their time,

374
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.000
uh,
attaching their wagon.
Oh my God.
Is,
is that far?

375
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:50.950
Is is Larry Merchant gone?

376
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.990
<v 4>Okay.</v>

377
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.720
<v 0>Larry Merchant,
I mean,
Jesus Christ that he,</v>

378
00:21:56.721 --> 00:21:59.180
that guy is like a cunt cunt.

379
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.273
<v 4>MMM.</v>

380
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.320
<v 0>He,
he,
there was just certain fighters you could tell he just fucking hated them,</v>

381
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.670
you know?
And he would never say anything positive.

382
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.280
And then he'd go in the ring and start talking tough.

383
00:22:13.281 --> 00:22:15.050
Like he was going to fucking do something.

384
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.190
<v 4>MMM Bye.</v>

385
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:23.180
<v 0>[inaudible],
you know,
he had that get off my lawn vibe.
Um,</v>

386
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.330
but anyways,
I was looking at my,
uh,

387
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:31.510
my travel schedule for that run that I have that starts in Iceland and ends in

388
00:22:33.171 --> 00:22:34.004
Israel.

389
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.293
<v 4>Uh,</v>

390
00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:38.590
<v 0>I have a day off</v>

391
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.800
<v 4>yeah.</v>

392
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.800
<v 0>Between wherever the fuck I end and then flying over to Israel and on that day</v>

393
00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.890
there's a moto GP race in Spain.

394
00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.790
But I just think it's going to be too much to try and get to,

395
00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:55.220
but I really was going to try to catch a fucking racist shit.

396
00:22:55.221 --> 00:22:58.430
I was going to try to go to Austin,
but um,

397
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.260
my schedules not working out,

398
00:23:00.261 --> 00:23:05.261
but I'm so fucking ridiculously excited for Formula One in Moto GP to start back

399
00:23:05.451 --> 00:23:08.960
up again.
This is what gets me through.
It's,
you know,

400
00:23:08.961 --> 00:23:12.950
you got the dog days of summer with baseball.
This is like the dog days before.

401
00:23:12.951 --> 00:23:17.030
I guess it's really just February now because march madness is next month.

402
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.690
<v 4>Okay.</v>

403
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.610
<v 0>You know,
football's fucking over so much madness is next month.</v>

404
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.440
But basketball and hockey,

405
00:23:23.441 --> 00:23:27.190
if it doesn't really start fucking mattering until like,
you know,
Jesus Christ,

406
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:31.150
the beginning of April,
you figuring out who's going to be what seed or whatever,

407
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:32.140
uh,

408
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.620
speaking in which congratulations to the Lakers and the last second shot beat my

409
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:38.740
fucking Boston Celtics.
Um,

410
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.320
I dunno what's going on with the Celtics.
I got the stupid fucking,

411
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.730
what they call it,
the hardwood classic package.
And I,

412
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.080
I've watched like three Bruins games this year and like half a Celtics game over

413
00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:54.630
Christmas.
I've just been so goddamn busy.
It's killing me.

414
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.920
I don't know what's going on.

415
00:23:55.921 --> 00:24:00.810
All I know is we have all this talent on the Celtics and I don't know if they're

416
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.860
underachieving or what,
but like I said,

417
00:24:04.861 --> 00:24:08.370
I was doing that acting Gig last week and one of the guys on the set today,

418
00:24:08.371 --> 00:24:12.330
what's up with Kyrie?
Is he going to go to la?
Um,

419
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.480
so just the fact that he was asking that made me,
uh,

420
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:23.310
made me a little bit nervous.
Um,
hey,

421
00:24:23.311 --> 00:24:27.330
by the way,
I'm watching this for this Davis Ruiz fight.
So I hopped up.

422
00:24:27.331 --> 00:24:30.450
That's how you say his fucking name.
And uh,

423
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.920
for half a second,
I thought it was in Los Angeles,
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

424
00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:38.910
I could have fucking gone to that.
But it's in Carson city,
Nevada.

425
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.840
And I was just thinking that's one of the few cities I've never been to.

426
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

427
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.490
<v 0>You know,
I've been to,
I've been all the A's,</v>

428
00:24:45.491 --> 00:24:49.180
all the B's in most of the CS sealevel cities.

429
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.180
Not saying that you city sucks,
it's just,
you know,

430
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.020
there's no professional sports team there.
You know,

431
00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.980
there's no traffic is a bit of a math problem.
You know,

432
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.200
you know the characteristics of the sea city.

433
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.840
You're downtown still.
You can still,
if you squint your eyes,

434
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:13.520
you're surprised like coal younger and Jesse James Aren't walking up the street.

435
00:25:13.521 --> 00:25:14.690
It's still has that,
you know,

436
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.650
wild west look about it.
At least it does out here.

437
00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:23.310
Carson city actually that is the capital of Nevada and I've never fucking been

438
00:25:23.311 --> 00:25:27.960
there.
A lot of people,
if you were to ask them,
hey man,

439
00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.690
like what's the Capitol in Nevada?
They would be like,
well,

440
00:25:30.691 --> 00:25:34.440
I would have to say that's Los Vegas.
And if you said no,
they'd be like,
okay,

441
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.990
a fucking Reno.
And you'd be like,
all right,
there's no reason that swear at me.

442
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:41.880
But no,
it's not reno.

443
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.480
Then they might even guest Loughlin before they would get,

444
00:25:46.481 --> 00:25:49.150
I don't even know where the fuck it is.
Where the,
Oh,
Carson city.
Oh,

445
00:25:49.151 --> 00:25:53.050
it's just south.
Just south of Reno.

446
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.590
I Love Reno.
I fucking love ring.
Oh,

447
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:03.550
and there's Lake Tahoe maybe.
I have been,
I've been to Lake Tahoe.

448
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.540
Jesus Christ said,
I just like pass right through Carson city.

449
00:26:07.541 --> 00:26:08.740
That even fucking realize it.

450
00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.370
How the fuck did Carson city ended up being the capital?

451
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.620
This has gotta be like some sort of gold rush,
cowboy shit.
By the way,

452
00:26:17.621 --> 00:26:22.621
there's a movie out called the man who killed Hitler and then the big foot

453
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.150
starring Sam Elliot.
All right.

454
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.890
If you don't fucking immediately try and find out how you can watch that movie.

455
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.990
You are no friend of mine.
It's about a guy,

456
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.330
you know the character.

457
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.340
He's the guy that found Hitler and killed them in World War II and now they're

458
00:26:42.341 --> 00:26:45.940
pulling him out of retirement because the big foot,

459
00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.870
not big four,
the big foot,
just like I'm watching the boxing.

460
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.990
<v 1>All right?</v>

461
00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:59.670
<v 0>He has to go to Canada and kill the big foot because evidently big foot is</v>

462
00:27:00.671 --> 00:27:05.671
walking around carrying some sort of plague that could wipe out human beings.

463
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.283
<v 1>So,</v>

464
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.620
<v 0>and evidently,</v>

465
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.630
I guess big foot is the Hitler of like,

466
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.860
uh,
uh,
uh,
abominable snowman.
How do you say that?
Fucking,
I don't know.

467
00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:22.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

468
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.620
<v 0>Like what,
what I dunno of Apes,
what fucking world does,</v>

469
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.060
I mean,
look this up right now,
this is,

470
00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.140
this is why the feds will never come and pick me up.

471
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.371
They'll never worry.

472
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:40.371
No matter how much conspiracy theory I say that I might be right about when they

473
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:42.300
just check my Google searches here.

474
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

475
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.940
<v 0>They'll just be like,
all right,</v>

476
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:49.350
this guy is not a threat because of this Google search right now,

477
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:52.020
what kind of animal

478
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:59.030
is,
somebody said big bird.

479
00:27:59.060 --> 00:27:59.893
Big Foot.

480
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

481
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.560
<v 0>I wonder if I'm the first one to ever search that.
What kind of animal,</v>

482
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.700
big foot or Scotch swatch are said to be Harry Upright walking.

483
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:11.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

484
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.600
<v 0>Is it from any sort of family?
You know,</v>

485
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.020
it's,
it's like an eight fucked Bill Walton,

486
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.590
as far as I can tell in North American folklore,

487
00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:30.591
bigfoot or Sasquatch are said to be Harry Upright walking ape like creatures

488
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:33.780
that dwell in the wilderness and leave footprints.

489
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.940
That's the funny thing about big foot.
What,

490
00:28:35.941 --> 00:28:40.820
what the fuck is the thing ever really done?
Yeah.

491
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:45.320
It walks around.
Okay.
You know,
a Sasquatch.

492
00:28:45.321 --> 00:28:47.630
You gotta leave your footprints all over the fucking place.

493
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.453
<v 1>You know,</v>

494
00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.950
<v 0>it's always running away.
It hasn't really done anything.</v>

495
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:57.030
That's why I love this movie.
They've somehow found a reason

496
00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:04.030
for man to finally find big foot and then kill the fucking thing.

497
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.610
All right.
If I was writing that screenplay,
okay.

498
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.710
Big Foot,
having that fucking,
you know,
carrying the plague.

499
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:22.590
Um,
in the end you would find out that it was all bullshit,

500
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.070
you know?
Then it,
it,
it wasn't really doing anything.
It just,

501
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:30.870
where it was walking around,

502
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.880
there was a lot of oil underneath the land where it was walking around.
So

503
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.680
the government then demonize big foot and said that it could take down this

504
00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:48.581
entire first world nation because it's walking around with the fucking was

505
00:29:48.921 --> 00:29:52.670
scarlet fever.
First of all,
nobody's ever seen big foot.

506
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.500
They don't know where the fuck are thing is.

507
00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.250
There's never really been a good picture of the God damn thing yet somehow they

508
00:29:58.251 --> 00:29:59.720
know it has the fucking plague.

509
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:04.790
All I know is Sam in it and I'm going to fucking watch that movie.
Um,

510
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.620
<v 2>okay.</v>

511
00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.440
<v 0>Is it in theaters?
You know something.
Can you fuck him?</v>

512
00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:14.270
I still can't believe aqua man made all that money,
mate.
I mean,
God,

513
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.480
I mean happy it did.
I'm happy some movies making some fucking money.

514
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.970
May 250 fucking million dollars.

515
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:26.960
I can't believe people saw that fucking movie.
Aqua man.

516
00:30:26.961 --> 00:30:31.250
He's a superhero in the ocean.
A fish don't commit crimes.

517
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.890
I know you want to go see it.
Yeah,

518
00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.170
I didn't see that movie.

519
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.460
What I would do is if I was right now Aquaman,

520
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.450
Aquaman is fucking pissed off because of that swirl.

521
00:30:47.451 --> 00:30:49.700
A trash out in the fucking Pacific Ocean.

522
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.660
And he's fine because he's not really a person.
Is it?
Right.

523
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.260
That should be my next Google search.
What kind of fish is Aquaman?

524
00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:02.090
What did Aquaman do you know what he is?
Some pirate fucked a mermaid.

525
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.610
Okay.
And that's,
and then the mermaid gave birth to Aquaman.

526
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.360
Alright.
Aqua man grew up without a dad.

527
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.770
It's probably a viking with this blonde hair.
He used to have blond hair anyways.

528
00:31:15.771 --> 00:31:19.940
I don't know.
When I was a kid,
he had blonde hair and an orange shirt,
you know,

529
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:26.270
now he looks like the fucking undertaker.
Anyways,

530
00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.780
undertakers nephew.
So anyways,
I was writing that fucking movie.

531
00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.153
Alright.

532
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:37.460
Some Viking bagged a mermaid whose kid knew historically speaking,

533
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.560
probably raped her,
right?

534
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.010
So he's the rate baby of a Viking and a mermaid.

535
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.720
All right?
So his dad's not around and he's a rapist.

536
00:31:47.721 --> 00:31:51.410
So there's no reason to look that guy up.
Plus he's on land and he has gills.

537
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.430
It can fucking breathe underwater.
And he sort of speaks through like waves.

538
00:31:55.490 --> 00:32:00.440
So I mean
it's bad enough.
You've got to try to fucking,
you know,

539
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.700
call up a rapist on father's day now.
I mean you don't really speak,

540
00:32:04.701 --> 00:32:08.420
so how can you communicate with them?
And then the mom,
you know,

541
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.420
sorta shuns him because of obviously how she got pregnant.

542
00:32:11.421 --> 00:32:13.430
So he is just sort of fucking,
you know,

543
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.730
he has issues with his mom.

544
00:32:16.731 --> 00:32:21.140
Definitely doesn't like his dad and his dad's really the only land dweller that

545
00:32:21.141 --> 00:32:25.010
he knows.
So he's just like,
you know what?
Fuck this man.
I don't need anybody.

546
00:32:25.011 --> 00:32:27.870
I'm just going to hang in the ocean with my fish friend.
Right.

547
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.290
Cause cause you know,
they don't fucking judge them or anything.

548
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.870
They take them in like,
you know,

549
00:32:32.871 --> 00:32:37.580
like the wolf's with the babies that get left out in the woods.
All right,

550
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.170
just bear with me.
I'm going
to get somewhere with this.
So then the fucking guy,

551
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.560
you know,
as he gets older and older and older,
right?
They just stay,

552
00:32:46.561 --> 00:32:48.140
just sitting there.
Uh,

553
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.780
all this trash keeps getting dumped in the ocean and finally he can't fucking

554
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:57.620
take it anymore.
And it gave,

555
00:32:57.621 --> 00:33:02.621
just goes on land and he starts fucking taking people out like Charles Bronson

556
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:05.120
and Deathwish.
All right,

557
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.670
<v 2>okay.</v>

558
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:11.620
<v 0>You know,
and like death wish it starts with a rape.
All right?
Put in this one.</v>

559
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.543
A,

560
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.770
he's doing it for the environment and the first people he kills are hoarders.

561
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.170
Well,
I guess hoarders he'd likes cause they don't pull it,
throw it in the ocean.

562
00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.280
You know what I mean?
He'd go after all those people know,
you know,

563
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:32.710
it fucking kill,
kill those people that,
that uh,

564
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:37.630
made that TV show about being minimalists that encourage all these people after

565
00:33:37.631 --> 00:33:40.660
they bought all this shit to just go down and dump it at goodwill and then

566
00:33:40.661 --> 00:33:43.750
goodwill just throws it in the fucking ocean or whatever the fuck it is they do

567
00:33:43.751 --> 00:33:45.950
with it.
You know what I mean?
Um,

568
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.250
man,

569
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.440
all the people I thought I thought he would kill when I really think about it.

570
00:33:52.441 --> 00:33:54.960
When Kelly was thinking though,
people in storage wars,
he killed them.

571
00:33:54.961 --> 00:33:55.794
He wouldn't,

572
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.220
those people take shit that usually get thrown out and they'd fucking buy it and

573
00:33:59.221 --> 00:34:00.900
they find some stupid fucked up by it.

574
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.463
<v 2>Okay.</v>

575
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.750
<v 0>I think he just hangs out at a goodwill and just as people show up at the</v>

576
00:34:07.751 --> 00:34:08.860
garbage bags of shit,

577
00:34:08.861 --> 00:34:12.670
he's just fucking take some and before the cops can get there,
right?

578
00:34:12.671 --> 00:34:16.240
The cops chase him back to the fucking ocean.
You know,

579
00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:22.450
maybe it goes to that swirl of trash and he's just find shit and he just goes

580
00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:27.100
through any fines,
addresses.
I don't fucking know.
I'll be honest with you.

581
00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:28.630
I don't even know what I'm talking about at this point.

582
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.210
I'm just telling you how I would do movies that I never saw.
I don't know.

583
00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.860
What the fuck did they do with aqua man?

584
00:34:36.861 --> 00:34:39.820
And then they gave him that chicken of the sea fucking pitchfork.

585
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.430
I didn't understand it.
Is He mad that we're eating tuna?

586
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.840
We're killing all his friends.
You know,
if that's the case,

587
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:50.630
he should start in Japan.
They're the ones that's doing all the Sushi.

588
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:55.460
They started that shit.
Right.
See,
I'm trying to get it out of my country.
Um,

589
00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.770
all right,
so they go,
no,

590
00:34:57.771 --> 00:35:00.740
I don't know where to go from here because now I only have like a fucking half

591
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.730
hour left.
I still have to do advertising and reads.
Okay.

592
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

593
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.680
<v 0>Um,
you know,
read your question.
So that's what I'll do on Monday.</v>

594
00:35:09.681 --> 00:35:13.400
I'll just bang out the last 25 minutes of this.
Um,

595
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.260
this has been the first half of the podcast,
the ramblings of a lonely man.

596
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

597
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.710
<v 0>Who was in a hotel room and he wants to call the front desk,</v>

598
00:35:23.711 --> 00:35:27.760
but there's no information on how exactly I'm supposed to fucking do that.

599
00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.990
But it's a good thing because I was going to order food and I'm not fucking

600
00:35:31.991 --> 00:35:33.490
hungry anymore.
All right.

601
00:35:33.491 --> 00:35:38.460
I'm going to watch this God damn fight and through the magic of and time.

602
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 3>Uh,
there'll be no delay on your podcast.
Just know the next time I talk,</v>

603
00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.653
<v 4>uh,</v>

604
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.230
<v 3>I don't know where it'll be Sunday or Monday.
I don't fucking know.</v>

605
00:35:48.231 --> 00:35:49.190
What do you give a shit?
Right?

606
00:35:49.191 --> 00:35:51.110
Cause it's going to be a half a second delay for you.

607
00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.230
And just like that,
now I'm in Los Angeles.
Isn't that amazing?

608
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.150
Isn't that amazing what an edit can do to you.

609
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:06.930
That was one second for me.
That was a fucking,
you know,
it's Monday morning.

610
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.970
Um,
I almost feel like I have to do the intro.
So much time has gone by,

611
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:12.481
by the way,

612
00:36:12.481 --> 00:36:17.250
I believe the last thing I was talking about Saturday say deal.

613
00:36:17.251 --> 00:36:22.251
Why don't you fucking come over on Saturday,

614
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:22.830
Saturday,
Saturday.

615
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:27.830
Say I'm not a card game that I played.

616
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.360
<v 2>Okay.</v>

617
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.220
<v 3>Crazy eights or some people call it dirty eights not so just a great fucking</v>

618
00:36:34.221 --> 00:36:36.770
game.
And I

619
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:37.840
<v 2>okay.</v>

620
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.490
<v 3>Suddenly realized,</v>

621
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:40.540
<v 2>okay.</v>

622
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.980
<v 3>You know,
cause I went over one of my relatives,</v>

623
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:44.903
<v 4>uh,</v>

624
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.490
<v 3>domiciles there and I'm just fucking</v>

625
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.230
<v 2>okay.</v>

626
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:54.230
<v 3>I was just walking around all wound up like I usually am brain going a mile a</v>

627
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.670
minute.
Can't fucking shut it off,
you know?

628
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.810
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

629
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:05.810
<v 3>The only thing that I've found that can shut it off is copious amounts of</v>

630
00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:10.230
alcohol or sitting down and smoking a cigar.

631
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.340
Neither of them are good for you,
but I found with cards,

632
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:17.910
if I just sit down,
there's something about shuffling the car's handling,

633
00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:22.620
the cards gets rid of that energy.
And I fucking chill out.

634
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:27.590
And then amazingly enough,
when I play cards,

635
00:37:27.591 --> 00:37:32.570
I have to learn how to control my emotions or else people know what's in my
hand.

636
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.350
I found it very therapeutic,
you know,

637
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:41.850
the TV wasn't on the entire time I was there and I didn't look at my smartphone

638
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.730
and my head felt clearer.

639
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

640
00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.870
<v 3>So I think I learned,
so I think I'm already a scatterbrain</v>

641
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.210
and uh,
all the TV screens and phone screens do not help.

642
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:58.510
Someone like that doesn't help someone like me is my brain's like,
oh,

643
00:37:58.511 --> 00:38:01.090
what about this?
What about this?
While I fucking look that up?
Oh,

644
00:38:01.091 --> 00:38:04.270
is that what that is?
Oh,
what does this link to?
Oh,
what,
what,

645
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.600
what does so and so looked like now that will surprise me,
you know?

646
00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:08.560
And then I'm just fucking,

647
00:38:08.561 --> 00:38:11.920
there goes two hours of my life and then I'm laying in bed and I can't fucking

648
00:38:11.921 --> 00:38:13.930
get to sleep.
So,

649
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:15.480
<v 2>okay.</v>

650
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.500
<v 3>I'm going to try to get my wife into playing cards,</v>

651
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.280
although I don't think she's going to do it because she's inherently a chill

652
00:38:21.281 --> 00:38:25.330
person.
And I'm worried that if she starts playing cards,

653
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.570
she might literally nod off and fall backwards out of the chair.

654
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.820
But anyways,
oh,
Billy freckles.
Oh,

655
00:38:37.821 --> 00:38:41.630
Billy freckles.
79 days,
no fucking booze.
And I'm,
I've got to admit,

656
00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.010
I am getting shit done.
I did a couple of things that I would never do.

657
00:38:46.011 --> 00:38:50.130
I edited two episodes of,
uh,
efforts.

658
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.230
Her family went through the script and throwing in my punchlines did it on the

659
00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:59.030
fucking plane in there is no way.
All right.

660
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.920
When it's not the off season,
if I'm playing,
if the season has started,

661
00:39:03.921 --> 00:39:06.500
there is no fucking way I would have gotten half of that done.

662
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.040
I would have sat there on the plane,
I would have watched a movie,

663
00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:15.440
I would have had one and I'd be like,
Hey,
I liked this failing.
Can we enhance it?

664
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.490
Yeah.
So
I dunno.

665
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.140
Do they have like binge drinker a AA meetings?

666
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.900
You know,
everybody there is just like board like,
yeah,
you know,
I can stop,

667
00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:35.570
you know,
I don't need the fucking,
you know,
I dunno.

668
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.330
I just named me.
It's a place where they're playing cards or some shit.
Yeah,

669
00:39:38.331 --> 00:39:42.170
Bill called the casino.
Um,
you don't,
and you don't have to drink.

670
00:39:42.171 --> 00:39:45.770
You can make that choice for yourself.
You can be brave.

671
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.840
You can be a warrior,
can be all of these fucking things.

672
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:56.090
Um,
all right,
hang on a second.
Anyways,

673
00:39:56.091 --> 00:40:00.860
I need to read some of the advertising here for this week here.
Oh,

674
00:40:00.861 --> 00:40:03.260
you know what?
I was coming back from our New York City,

675
00:40:03.261 --> 00:40:05.450
so I always get the New York Post.
That's my thing,
man.

676
00:40:05.451 --> 00:40:07.310
I read the post and the Daily News,

677
00:40:07.311 --> 00:40:11.090
but mostly the post cause I like the sports section better.
Um,

678
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.610
I uh,
you know,
I was reading this shit,
you know,

679
00:40:16.611 --> 00:40:20.360
the Yankees like spring training started and it's so fucking funny,

680
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:23.840
like the Yankee Mindset,

681
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.210
which is totally George Steinbrenner,
where like we,

682
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:31.730
we haven't won a world series.
You know,

683
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.650
we lost to the red sox to the honeymoon is over and grab bar by rabbi.

684
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.920
There's always a,
there's always this threat,
you know,

685
00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:42.590
with that whatever manager they have a whatever,

686
00:40:42.591 --> 00:40:47.360
there's always this constant pressure that like they have to somehow do the

687
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:51.320
impossible,
which is to win the way they used to win.
Well,

688
00:40:51.321 --> 00:40:54.380
actually they would accept the way they want in the late nineties,
but um,

689
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.350
I do respect that out of that franchise.

690
00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:00.800
But it's also funny because it's an empty threat.
Like,

691
00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:02.930
what are you gonna stop watching?
You know,

692
00:41:02.931 --> 00:41:06.650
we all know we're not going to abandon our teams,
at least the real fans one.

693
00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.770
All right.
Legal Zoom,
everybody.
Legal Zoom.

694
00:41:09.771 --> 00:41:14.540
If you're determined to start a business or secure your family's future in 2019,

695
00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:18.410
it's easy to get distracted by hurdles that pop up along the way.

696
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:23.050
<v 5>How many would it be?
Okay if we went out to here?
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.</v>

697
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:25.840
<v 3>That's right.
Whatever you just agreed to,</v>

698
00:41:25.841 --> 00:41:27.730
that's when you would have done your fucking will.

699
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.010
That's why legal zoom is here to help.

700
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:35.810
But their network of independent there gunslingers that wild man.

701
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:39.470
They're out there on their own,
licensed in all 50 states.

702
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.630
How the fuck do you do that?
You're going to take the bar exam 50 times.

703
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.130
Legal Zoom can help you navigate your legal needs.

704
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.520
We'll bill once you're a lawyer.

705
00:41:49.521 --> 00:41:53.830
You nearly need to me to fill out an application.
Well,
but our bell,

706
00:41:53.831 --> 00:41:58.730
they hired 50 lawyers.
Maybe they did that one from each state,
I dunno.

707
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.140
From wills and trusts to Llcs,
trademarks,

chicken and your God Damn Pie hole.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:12.440
That's legal zoom.com oh man.
You know why it went off the rails,

726
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:16.570
but I crushed it in the end.
It's the simply safe.

727
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:23.240
Are you simple and you want to be safe?
We have a solution for you.

728
00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.880
So here's a timely stat stat for you.

729
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.700
I'm almost half of us make a new year,
new year's resolution every single year.

730
00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:35.150
We've all made them and most of us probably broken them,
not me,
man.

731
00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:36.710
I said I wasn't drinking this year.

732
00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.390
I'm better than you happens to the best of us,

733
00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:43.820
but one resolution worth sticking to this year,

734
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.550
keeping your home and family safe.

735
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.540
That's why I recommend simply safe home security.

736
00:43:50.541 --> 00:43:54.020
Evidently according to the copy,
I didn't realize that I recommended it.

737
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.540
I thought I'd just read it because they gave me money over there.

738
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.860
Simply safe is a 24,
seven home security is 24,

739
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:04.040
seven home security with no contracts or catch catches.

740
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.160
They believe the safest place on earth should be your home.

741
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.390
So you feel protected every time you shut your door and leave for work or shut

742
00:44:11.391 --> 00:44:13.070
your eyes at night.

743
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.090
I'll save this Ted Nugent feel at home.
You know,

744
00:44:17.091 --> 00:44:21.440
he walks around with like a fucking gun strapped to each leg and a crossbow

745
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:24.410
around his fucking back.
More than three electric.
See,

746
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:29.411
somebody shoot me when I take a piss in my own half more than 3 million people

747
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:34.290
instead of leaves,
you know,
in his hat,
he probably has like wallpaper,
you know,

748
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:35.580
so it blends in with his house.

749
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.760
More than 3 million people already feel this way every day,

750
00:44:38.761 --> 00:44:42.510
thanks to simply safe.
And they're not the only ones.

751
00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:47.480
They're not the only wall hons with home security.

752
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.000
The folks at PC magazine named simply safe,

753
00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:54.360
both editor's choice in reader's choice for 2018.
Well,
there you go.

754
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:59.220
There's a legit magazine,
PC magazine.
Um,
2000,
I'd never heard of it.

755
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:04.260
2019 feels like a good year to ask yourself,
is my home is safe?

756
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:07.830
As it could be any of you thinking,
well,

757
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:12.660
maybe this year or if you're thinking,
well,
maybe this year,
uh,

758
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.260
maybe this is the year to change that.
Fuck.
Call to action.

Jerry's berries.
Why your bug in,
uh,

764
00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:38.230
talk about your plans for Valentine's Day this year.

765
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.050
What would you do if you weren't procrastinating?

766
00:45:41.051 --> 00:45:45.400
I didn't procrastinate and had my wife reached out to somebody of influence and

767
00:45:45.401 --> 00:45:49.180
they got us a reservation at a fucking restaurant that we wouldn't be able to

768
00:45:49.181 --> 00:45:51.670
get into if I just called myself.

769
00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:52.590
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

770
00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.850
<v 3>Do you know who I am?
I did a half hour comedy central once.</v>

771
00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.073
<v 1>Hello.</v>

772
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:03.450
<v 3>Well going in Mcdonald's.
All right.
Um,</v>

773
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.660
share a personal Valentine's Day story.

774
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:11.220
What are your must gives?
You got to get a Ricard.

775
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

776
00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.000
<v 0>Uh,
you got to get her some flowers.
You got it.</v>

777
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:23.620
You can't just give her the card and have something that some stranger rope.

778
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:25.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

779
00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.850
<v 0>For whoever bought the card.</v>

780
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.940
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

781
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.820
<v 0>You have to add a paragraph of your own shit</v>

782
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.960
and you have to write that paragraph out on something else,

783
00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:42.130
so when you inevitably have a spelling error or run out of room or something

784
00:46:42.131 --> 00:46:46.600
like that,
you don't do it on the card and then you painstakingly copying

785
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.810
over to the new card and then you hand it to your wife.

786
00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.450
She reads it in three seconds it goes,

787
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:56.463
<v 1>oh,</v>

788
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:58.400
<v 0>reaches over,</v>

789
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.800
gives you a nice kiss and then looks over your shoulder to see if there's a

790
00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:08.801
package in some sort of heart shape rapping to see if she got some shiny shit so

791
00:47:10.461 --> 00:47:15.461
she can decide at what level she's going to fuck you that night she going to go

792
00:47:16.221 --> 00:47:17.270
through the motions.

793
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:23.440
Is she going to give you the first three months of your relationship sex or is

794
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:25.880
she going to take it to another level?

795
00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:33.180
<v 3>It all depends on whether or not there's a tray of Sherry berries over your</v>

796
00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:38.080
shoulder.
When she goes to hug you.
I mean,
come on people.

797
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:39.940
Do I even need to read the copy after this?

798
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:44.920
I'll do it just as an exercise in trying to get better on how to re reading out

799
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:49.810
loud.
Okay.
Um,
never go wrong with the um,

800
00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:54.970

801
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.870
dark or white chocolatey goodness for any discerning palate.

802
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.570
She'll fall in love with every bite.

803
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:07.960
Stop cheating on a top with decadent toppings.
Chocolate chips,

804
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.970
heart and glittery sprinkles.
Honey,

805
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:13.660
I have to admit I'm having an emotional affair.

848
00:50:45.661 --> 00:50:47.220
books now.
Like I read a lot of them,

849
00:50:47.221 --> 00:50:51.420
but like I really think that my brain does not do well.

850
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:56.130
Watching a bunch of shows in and screens and stuff.
I just,

854
00:51:08.071 --> 00:51:10.680
fuck old people do,
but it ain't no whatever.
I'm going to read some books.

855
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.270
We'll see.
Um,
there are a lot of,
my,

856
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:18.480
my favorite things to do those with Reader's digest is to read the awful jokes

857
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:19.950
to my wife.

858
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:23.280
And I know that that's a Jim Norton bit back from the Opie and Anthony Show,

859
00:51:23.281 --> 00:51:27.180
but I feel like if I do it in my bedroom,
I'm not stealing from him.

860
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:28.620
Maybe I'll give him credit next time.

861
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:32.640
He used to read the comics was one of my favorite bits that he would do.

862
00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:37.440
Um,
then the local news,
the newspaper,
daily comic,
sorry.

863
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.840
There are a lot of books on Los Angeles history.

864
00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:40.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

865
00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.700
<v 3>Ah,
this person writes,
I find the whole,</v>

866
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.340
the whole thing fascinating.

867
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.190
Why am I so much,
uh,

868
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.590
even thought it's history,
even though it even thought,

869
00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.810
even though person wrote thought,

870
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.690
even though it's history isn't as long as Boston,
Philly and New York,

871
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.880
the whole thing is fascinating.
Um,
let me see.
They said I made an album,

872
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:10.430
uh,
on this go to the page.
I would like to see this.

873
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:12.483
<v 2>Okay,</v>

874
00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:13.523
<v 3>let's see.</v>

875
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:14.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

876
00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:17.950
<v 3>Oh yeah.
Look at the old,
oh my goodness.
Look at these old houses.</v>

877
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.910
Holy Shit.
They just knocked all of this shit down,
didn't they?

878
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:24.900
<v 2>Okay.</v>

879
00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:29.530
<v 3>Oh many times.
Must a plow at fucking over.
You know,</v>

880
00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:33.460
a lot of old houses.
They just had that creepy fucking look.

881
00:52:33.461 --> 00:52:36.130
But these are incredible.
And you know what?

882
00:52:36.131 --> 00:52:38.590
I just realized that you guys can't see him.
All right,

883
00:52:38.591 --> 00:52:41.740
let's get back to whatever the fuck it was I was reading.
Um,

884
00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:44.830
Ben highlights just how,
okay.

885
00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:49.630
I'm at an album that highlights just how true bill's bulldoze everything is.

886
00:52:49.631 --> 00:52:54.550
La destroyed an entire historic neighborhood downtown to force the poor from the

887
00:52:54.551 --> 00:52:58.450
city center and build more economically viable skyscrapers.

888
00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:02.350
One of the darkest blemishes and Ellie's history.
And that's not the,

889
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:06.910
that's not the whole knee wall on the amount of neighborhoods is destroyed and

890
00:53:06.911 --> 00:53:11.260
people displaced due to freeway construction is astronomic and is estimated at

891
00:53:11.261 --> 00:53:16.261
300,000 people were displaced between 1940 and 1974 the freeways,

892
00:53:16.871 --> 00:53:18.820
which pretty much destroyed the history.

893
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:23.020
This historic city explains why La is more suburban,

894
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:27.810
uh,
than cities San Francisco.
Yeah.

895
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:30.750
It's fascinating how they do a lot of stuff.
You know,
there's eminent domain,

896
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:32.580
which means,
well,
we're building this freeway.

897
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:37.950
He can take this money for your house or we'll just fucking take it from you.
Um,

898
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.520
I try not to get too sad about it.
I just look at it like,
you know,

899
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.850
when those historic neighborhoods were being built,

900
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:46.890
there was native Americans crying going,
you know,

901
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:51.390
we used to fucking sit there and uh,
I dunno.
It's just getting a buffalo,

902
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.580
whatever the fuck it.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck.
You know,

903
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.290
there's always going to be somebody that,
you know,

904
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:58.200
you know what used to be there,
so I don't know.

905
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.540
Get a deck of cards and shut off your fucking TV and maybe can have a nice 20

906
00:54:03.541 --> 00:54:07.770
minutes to yourself.
All right.
Advice from Mormon at Byu.

907
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:11.700
Um,
hey there,
Billy nickname.
Uh,

908
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:15.730
last week in your podcast you read a letter from a Mormon attending Byu asking

909
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:19.110
for advice about leaving the church as a former Mormon.

910
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:25.170
That's a great former Mormon.
Hi,
I'm Mike Mormon.

911
00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:26.010
I'm a former Mormon.

912
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:31.830
Keep it going for the former Mormon who also grew up in Utah.

913
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.040
I thought I could only offer a little advice for them.

914
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.250
I thought I could offer a little advice for them.

915
00:54:38.251 --> 00:54:42.270
I also went through something similar when I was 19 I told my parents I wasn't

916
00:54:42.271 --> 00:54:46.200
going to go on a mission,
which is a huge rite of passage in the Mormon religion.

917
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.711
Oh my God,

918
00:54:46.711 --> 00:54:50.850
they must have been crushed and then you got to deal with upsetting the two

919
00:54:50.851 --> 00:54:53.220
people that you want the most approval approval from.

920
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:56.130
They were really upset about it and it was hard for me to do,

921
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:59.250
but I couldn't lie to myself anymore and try to believe in what the church

922
00:54:59.251 --> 00:55:00.960
teaches.
Not long after that,

923
00:55:00.961 --> 00:55:04.410
I moved out of my parents' house and started attending the University of Utah in

924
00:55:04.411 --> 00:55:07.920
Salt Lake City.
It seemed daunting at the time and I didn't know.

925
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:11.430
I didn't think I would be able to afford it,
but somehow is able to do it.

926
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.270
Good for you.

927
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.660
The hardest part about leaving the church is that all that the other members

928
00:55:15.661 --> 00:55:19.440
will ask you a million questions about why you're leaving and they're always

929
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:23.160
trying to convince you to come back.
Obviously,

930
00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:25.050
you can't shut out your family completely,

931
00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:27.360
but if you don't believe in what the Church teaches,

932
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:31.680
then you're not doing yourself any favors by staying just because it's routine.

933
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:35.460
Take it from me.
I left the church a long time ago and I don't regret it.

934
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.090
The people I know who have regrets,
other ones I went to high school with,

935
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:41.310
stayed in the church,
went on missions,

936
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:45.660
got married in the temple and ended up leaving Mormonism.
Anyway,
uh,

937
00:55:45.661 --> 00:55:48.330
they all say that they would do things differently if they had to do it over

938
00:55:48.331 --> 00:55:51.720
again.
The Mormon church isn't going anywhere.
It will always be there.

939
00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:54.570
If you eventually decided to go back,
decided to go back,

940
00:55:54.571 --> 00:55:57.870
but you'll never get your time back if you decide to stay in the church and then

941
00:55:57.871 --> 00:55:58.704
end up regretting it.

942
00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:02.520
I hope this helps and I'm sure you'll meet people who feel the exact same way

943
00:56:02.521 --> 00:56:07.110
you do.
I've met tons of them and they really helped me out anyways as always.

944
00:56:07.111 --> 00:56:10.350
Thanks and go hug yourself.
Wow.
Yeah.
I imagine if you know,

945
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:13.560
if you looked for some sort of support group online,

946
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.540
you could probably find a way to do that and I like what he said.

947
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:21.390
The church is always going to be there.
You can always come back,

948
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.480
you know or you know.

949
00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:27.510
Maybe you enjoy it as much as this guy does and you stay out.
There you go.

950
00:56:27.511 --> 00:56:31.410
It's your life.
You choose.
All right.
Advice from Warman.
Here we go.

951
00:56:31.411 --> 00:56:34.170
Here's another one,
dear Billy bow,

952
00:56:34.171 --> 00:56:39.030
B.
A.
L.
B.
A.
L.
Look it up.
All right.
What was this Mormon football bag?

953
00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:44.700
Let's see.
B.
A.
L.
Yeah,

954
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.210
Mormon word.
How many time bol.

955
00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

956
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.380
<v 3>All right.
What the fuck is this?</v>

957
00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.090
This is some deep religious shit here.
Bible dictionary.

958
00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:01.213
<v 2>Okay.</v>

959
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.030
<v 3>B,
a l,</v>

960
00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.660
possessor lord the Sun God and the mail or

961
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:12.110
should narrative principle in nature.

962
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:17.390
He was worshiped with different ideas and rights in different places.

963
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.720
So it's a possessor Lord.

964
00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:23.920
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

965
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.160
<v 3>the fuck is a possessor.
Lord.
Is that a landlord for Jesus?
I don't,</v>

966
00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:30.100
I don't even know what that means to you.
This is why I,

967
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.630
why I just try to keep my life simple cause even if I don't know a word,

968
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:37.840
if I look it up,
I still don't know the word.
All I'm left with is more questions.

969
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:43.350
Just wanted to chime in on the advice that she gave that kid at Byu.

970
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.550
Okay,
good.
Cause I didn't think I gave him good advice.
I had no idea what I,

971
00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.573
whatever.

972
00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:51.970
I grew up Catholic on the east coast and converted to Mormonism when I was 18

973
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:57.130
then a year later I left my top 20 college to serve a mission in Las Vegas.

974
00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:58.880
<v 2>Okay.</v>

975
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.330
<v 3>You went to Las Vegas to try and convert people.
Jesus Christ.</v>

976
00:58:02.331 --> 00:58:03.980
You dove in with both feet.

977
00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.193
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

978
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:08.350
<v 3>Can I just talk to you for a second about Mormonism.</v>

979
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:10.100
<v 2>Okay.</v>

980
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.860
<v 3>Some guy sitting at a blackjack table,
he's on a roll or even worse.</v>

981
00:58:12.861 --> 00:58:16.400
He's fucking losing.
When I got back,
my school wouldn't take me.

982
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.810
I was in a music program for drums and hadn't practiced in two years.

983
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:25.010
So I had hoped to go to Byu for a year and build my chops back up before I could

984
00:58:25.011 --> 00:58:28.650
get back into my original program.
Wait a minute.

985
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.220
What do you mean?
In what way would the fuck does your school not take you?

986
00:58:34.221 --> 00:58:36.740
I was a grew up Catholic.
He converted Mormonism.

987
00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:41.210
You left your top 20 college to serve a mission in Las Vegas?
When I got back,

988
00:58:41.211 --> 00:58:42.470
my school wouldn't take me.

989
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:43.660
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

990
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.700
<v 3>Oh.
So I had to go to Byu,</v>

991
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.401
uh,

992
00:58:49.401 --> 00:58:53.000
for a year and build my chops back up before I could get back into my original

993
00:58:53.001 --> 00:58:55.580
program.
Ah,
cause you haven't played drums in two years.
All right.

994
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:56.953
<v 2>Okay.</v>

995
00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:59.380
<v 3>I got married in the church and because my parents were members,</v>

996
00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:01.660
they couldn't go to the ceremony in the temple.

997
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

998
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:03.903
<v 3>What?</v>

999
00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:07.720
We did have a separate ring ceremony from my friends and family as a marriage in

1000
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:11.950
the temple is usually small with a little pomp and circumstance.
Um,

1001
00:59:11.951 --> 00:59:15.130
I can't think of anything that I've heard that has hurt my parents as much as

1002
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:18.790
this decision that I had made surrounding my beliefs.
The long talks,

1003
00:59:18.791 --> 00:59:23.110
the arguments,
the crying,
the pain of not around their son,
et cetera.

1004
00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:26.620
It was very hard on my family.
Through all of that though,

1005
00:59:26.621 --> 00:59:29.200
they want me to be happy and want me to be me.

1006
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:33.280
We are closer now than we have ever been.
Having worked through our differences.

1007
00:59:33.281 --> 00:59:35.320
Your parents should always love and support you.
Well,

1008
00:59:35.321 --> 00:59:36.520
it depends on what you're doing.

1009
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.350
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:40.890
<v 3>You know,
if you're going to go rob a liquor store,
shoot some heroin.</v>

1011
00:59:40.891 --> 00:59:44.160
I don't think they should love and support.
Well,
they could say no in a loving,

1012
00:59:44.161 --> 00:59:47.430
supporting way.
While I was at Byu,

1013
00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:52.140
there was a student in my program that took his life because he didn't like the

1014
00:59:52.141 --> 00:59:55.560
lifestyle of the church and was scared of what his parents would think.

1015
00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:56.520
Oh my God.

1016
00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.300
Haven't spoken to his parents after his death.

1017
01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:04.420
They would rather have this son alive and out of the church than dead and in the

1018
01:00:04.421 --> 01:00:07.570
church.
Wow.
It will be hard,

1019
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:11.560
but don't ever feel like there is no way out and no way that,

1020
01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:16.060
and no one that has your back.
Byu can make you feel that way.

1021
01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.340
Begin to talk with your parents about it now and share how you feel about

1022
01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:25.270
yourself.
They will be hurt,
but still love you.
Eat a Dick Bill.

1023
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.320
Get some meat on those bones.
You skinny bitch.
I love on a,
you know,

1024
01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:33.230
if I'm fat,
I'm fat.
If I'm skinny,
I'm too skinny.

1025
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.130
I just can't make people happy.

1026
01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.510
Um,
all right.
What do we got here from a masculine lesbian lady?

1027
01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:50.430
Oh,
I put it out there.
You know,
Valentine's Day was coming up,

1028
01:00:50.431 --> 01:00:53.700
you know,
is coming up.
You need all the pressure is always on the guy.

1029
01:00:53.701 --> 01:00:57.270
And we have to show how much we loved them and they really don't have to do shit

1030
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.740
other than put on something hot and bang you and they act like they're doing you

1031
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:05.760
a favor when sex feels good to them too.
So I don't really don't understand,

1032
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:09.480
you know?
Can you imagine if I acted like,
you know,

1033
01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:11.400
banging my wife was,

1034
01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:16.401
was this great pleasure thing for her as I'm on top of her,

1035
01:01:16.501 --> 01:01:18.030
like Ah,
ah,

1036
01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:21.720
like I'm not having a good time and those are the noises I make during sex and

1037
01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:24.840
you can fucking deal with that for the rest of the day.
Have that in your head.

1038
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:29.190
Ah,
eh.
Ah,
that's what I do on a loop,
on a loop.

1039
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.170
Um,
from a masculine.
So I asked,
you know,

1040
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:39.150
I want to talk to the man and the LED's them with a more manly woman in the

1041
01:01:39.151 --> 01:01:41.970
lesbian relationship.
Does what does she have to do?

1042
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1043
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:45.560
<v 3>You know,
cause there's two ladies there right now.</v>

1044
01:01:45.561 --> 01:01:47.630
Do you boat demand shit or does one,

1045
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:51.920
you know the one who has to go up on the fucking roof during the rain to fix the

1046
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:55.490
fucking,
you know,
Goddamn,
uh,
the,
the,

1047
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.000
the fucking satellite dish,
right?
So anyways,
hey yo.

1048
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:00.870
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1049
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:02.070
<v 3>I came Billy.</v>

1050
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1051
01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.780
<v 3>Bib.
A city.</v>

1052
01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:09.240
The bass city got another word.
I have to look up.
I have no idea.

1053
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:12.180
Where do you guys,
where do you guys hear these fucking words?

1054
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.450
I know I can't spell.
I know I'm fucking stupid

1055
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:20.540
now.
[inaudible] usually

1056
01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.270
<v 2>uncountable.
Uh,</v>

1057
01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:28.340
the practice or habit of drinking too much alcohol.
Oh my God,

1058
01:02:28.341 --> 01:02:33.290
I love this word.
How do you pronounce it?
Pronunciation.

1059
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.150
Is it the Basti

1060
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:40.290
<v 3>come on,
let me hear.
Let me hear it eventually.</v>

1061
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:47.710
Actually.
How do you say it?

1062
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:54.550
The mastery as it a so you say bye bye.
[inaudible].

1063
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:59.750
All right.
Ay Yo Billy.
Bob Asity.
Wow.

1064
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:02.270
Visit this.
This,
this person's a Finca,

1065
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:06.950
although I think you are back on the wagon of,
of late.
Yes,
I am.
Um,

1066
01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.070
I had been a fan of yours.
Wait,

1067
01:03:10.071 --> 01:03:12.380
am I going to look that word up again with Dai already?
Forget what it means.

1068
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.370
Yeah.
Booze Hound,
right?

1069
01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:15.500
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1070
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.560
<v 3>The Bass City,
the practice or habit of drinking too much alcohol.</v>

1071
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:26.680
Um,
somebody who Bose is,
that's a great name for a band.

1072
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:31.330
It's a great name for a podcast.
Uh,
Billy verbosity,

1073
01:03:31.331 --> 01:03:34.030
I dunno if he can beat that.
That's a great wrestling character.

1074
01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:39.550
He's drunk.
He can't hear the ref.
Um,

1075
01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:42.640
I have been a fan of yours,
uh,
going on a decade now.

1076
01:03:42.641 --> 01:03:45.880
You are literally my favorite comedian all the way back to punching the muffins

1077
01:03:45.881 --> 01:03:50.740
in the,
at the flea market.
My flip and favorite.
Ah,
God bless you.
Uh,

1078
01:03:50.741 --> 01:03:55.741
you put out the call for a masculine lesbian the way to,

1079
01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:59.020
right.
So here's your ear full.
First off,

1080
01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:01.060
I have no idea what it's like to be a man.

1081
01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.380
All I know is that I can relate to so many of your jokes and rants about the

1082
01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:07.960
dynamics between men and women from the man's side.

1083
01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.510
Isn't it refreshing to hear a woman say she actually doesn't know what it's like

1084
01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:14.140
to be a man?
So many of these fucking assholes?
I know exactly what it's like.

1085
01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:18.340
It's easier.
Um,
I've,
you're,
you're a cartoon character.

1086
01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.220
I've been married to my lovely wife for 21 years.

1087
01:04:21.221 --> 01:04:26.050
The first nine illegally until same sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts.

1088
01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:31.240
Uh,
when we legalized our vows,
congratulations.
Uh,

1089
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.080
in our relationship,
I am the breadwinner.

1090
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:39.670
The fixer of are all broken things.
The killer of scary bugs for sure.

1091
01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:43.690
The one who would have to climb on the roof and fix the damn and 10 and the
rain.

1092
01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.220
Barring that,
the one that's got to negotiate with the servicemen,

1093
01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:52.060
while she nudges me and says,
just pay him,
I'm missing my show.

1094
01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:58.120
The one who pays for dinner,
even when I'm the,
the celebrated,
the list goes on.

1095
01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:02.890
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.
Could I have a beer with you further?

1096
01:05:02.891 --> 01:05:07.480
I am expected to ensure my lovely wife is wowed on Valentine's Day,

1097
01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:12.160
our anniversary and her birthday.
I make good money.
Don't get me wrong,

1098
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:16.510
but my gosh,
I liked it.
You already said flipping in.

1099
01:05:16.511 --> 01:05:19.230
My Gosh.
Are you a card player?

1100
01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:24.240
The plague old lady cards.
Crazy eights.
Um,

1101
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.690
what the hell am I?
I ended on,
my gosh,
I,
in fairness,

1102
01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.270
she puts up with my mercurial attitude,

1103
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.150
circular debating and occasional raging,
wait,
if somebody trolling me right now,

1104
01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:42.780
is this the lesbian version of me still?
I have not,

1105
01:05:42.781 --> 01:05:47.530
but I don't say my gosh still,
I have no doubt that I would be cut in half

1106
01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.840
if we,
we divorced also,

1107
01:05:50.841 --> 01:05:55.610
no doubt she'll outlive me while being such a brave widow,
lol.

1108
01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.800
Uh,
before I get all Rodney Dangerfield on you,
no respect,

1109
01:05:58.801 --> 01:06:01.400
they'll tell you no respect at all.
Uh,
in truth,

1110
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:05.120
we're the best of friends all the way back to our first day in high school.

1111
01:06:05.121 --> 01:06:10.121
She understands me more than anyone in my life and is truly help push me forward

1112
01:06:10.311 --> 01:06:13.970
in my career in ways I never thought possible when went.
See now as a man,

1113
01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:17.880
I don't think I could ever admit that about my wife.
Maybe that's the flaw.
Uh,

1114
01:06:17.881 --> 01:06:21.290
she's funny without trying and brilliantly smart and honest.

1115
01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:23.810
She helps me be a better person.
Wait,

1116
01:06:23.811 --> 01:06:27.650
did near right this and she's pretending to be a lesbian.
Um,

1117
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:28.760
<v 2>okay.</v>

1118
01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.330
<v 3>As a woman of a certain age,
49.</v>

1119
01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:35.530
I came up at a time when dynamics between same sex relationship and had the male

1120
01:06:35.531 --> 01:06:38.920
female polarity exceed expectation attached.

1121
01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.350
I don't think it's as much that way now.

1122
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:46.560
So much has changed in the Lgbtq culture since we were coming up.

1123
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.530
Lesbian,
gay,
Bi,
trans,
queer.

1124
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.970
I Fuck I can't,
it's something I'll say you have to look up.

1125
01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:00.870
I can never remember how that goes.
LGBTQ.

1126
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.520
<v 2>Um,
then back then</v>

1127
01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:07.590
<v 3>old man voice back in my day,</v>

1128
01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:12.591
the term butch fem was hugely popular and I am definitely more butch.

1129
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:18.350
It's also a regional identity associated more with the east coast and the West.

1130
01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:23.700
We've lived out west for over a decade and don't see a whole lot of butch.
Slash.

1131
01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.133
Femme.

1132
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1133
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.320
<v 3>I Dunno,
but for that matter we're not nearly as social as we were back east.</v>

1134
01:07:30.321 --> 01:07:34.980
So who knows?
You should totally do a study on butches.
We are,

1135
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:36.240
we are a good lot.

1136
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:40.560
Hope that helps and go fuck yourself to do you realize how fucking hilarious it

1137
01:07:40.561 --> 01:07:44.130
was.
It would be in a perfect world.

1138
01:07:44.131 --> 01:07:47.280
You went into a bar after having a fight with your wife and some

1139
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.030
dude in the lesbian relationships,

1140
01:07:51.031 --> 01:07:54.600
sort of old school chick was sitting there at the bar and you both fucking hit

1141
01:07:54.601 --> 01:07:57.750
it off be fucking hilarious.

1142
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:59.263
<v 2>MMM,</v>

1143
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:05.320
<v 3>I see.
I think that's just how it is.
I just think in maybe all relationships,</v>

1144
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:06.010
there's just,

1145
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:09.970
there's the person that's fucking pulling the wagon and then there's a person

1146
01:08:09.971 --> 01:08:13.960
sitting in the wagon complaining.
Um,
you know,

1147
01:08:13.961 --> 01:08:18.080
but when you stop the,
you know,
they rub your back.
I don't,

1148
01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:19.790
I don't fucking know any dilemma,

1149
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:24.320
dear Billy four in the road.

1150
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:30.710
Is it supposed to be fork in the road?
That's for dear Billy.
For in the road.

1151
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.610
If you had to choose between,
I think it's fork in the road.

1152
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:39.140
If you had to choose between being president of the United States or pope of the

1153
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.010
Catholic Church,
which would you choose and why?
Oh,
president.

1154
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:43.630
Because I don't want,

1155
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:48.630
it would have to make evil decisions for most eight years and at the least four

1156
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:53.480
years.
That's why I would do it.

1157
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:58.520
They're both absolutely horrific jobs and the amount of blood on your hands at

1158
01:08:58.521 --> 01:09:00.280
the end of it is,
um,

1159
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:05.380
I don't think it's something you ever get past if you're a truly normal human

1160
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:07.220
being.
And I don't,

1161
01:09:07.221 --> 01:09:10.550
but that's why I don't think normal human beings go for their job.

1162
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.240
Go for those jobs.
All right.
Um,

1163
01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:18.080
and there's a lot of people,
you know,
especially in politics,

1164
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:20.870
they put on the fucking white hat and they act like they're there for you.

1165
01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.720
Some of them are,
but they're always,

1166
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:28.160
they're always now labeled as Socialists and working for,
you know,

1167
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:34.520
isis or the Russians or whatever,
and they just get buried.
Um,

1168
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.720
you know,
I dunno,
you watched,
you watched it,
that,

1169
01:09:41.721 --> 01:09:42.630
that young woman there,

1170
01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:46.230
that 29 year old woman who everybody is just flipping out about for whatever

1171
01:09:46.231 --> 01:09:47.910
reason,
because she's young and pretty.

1172
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:50.100
I don't know why everybody's freaking out about her.

1173
01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:54.030
She has very little experience and everybody is freaking out.
Like,

1174
01:09:54.031 --> 01:09:55.120
she's fucking amazing me.

1175
01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:00.140
One of the things that she wanted to do was tax certain American 70% and it's

1176
01:10:00.241 --> 01:10:01.470
just like a taxing.

1177
01:10:01.471 --> 01:10:06.000
Anybody more than 50% is fucking criminal.

1178
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:10.020
The fact that you're doing the job,

1179
01:10:10.021 --> 01:10:13.980
you actually get up and do the job and then somebody who didn't do the job gets

1180
01:10:13.981 --> 01:10:18.981
more fucking money then that is fucking criminal and watching this woman just

1181
01:10:20.221 --> 01:10:21.780
sitting there,
you know,

1182
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:25.710
talking to these old politicians and acting like she's sitting there with the

1183
01:10:25.711 --> 01:10:29.910
two by four and it's going to start cleaning shit up and she's completely

1184
01:10:29.911 --> 01:10:33.240
ignoring the $800 billion gorilla in the room.

1185
01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:38.180
Completely fucking ignoring it.
Okay.
And she's gonna,

1186
01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:42.150
she w you watch all her righteousness and all her fucking bullshit.

1187
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.530
I guarantee you.

1188
01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:47.280
Guess who's going to be a multimillionaire at the end of her political career,

1189
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:51.510
even if she doesn't advance past the senator or House of representative level

1190
01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.960
where she only makes six figures a year guest who's going to be a

1191
01:10:54.961 --> 01:10:59.250
multimillionaire sign a massive book deal,

1192
01:10:59.251 --> 01:11:03.960
totally fucking sellout and buy a big ass fucking house and maybe doing an arena

1193
01:11:03.961 --> 01:11:08.550
tour like Michelle Obama or go on a speaking tour like every other fucking

1194
01:11:08.551 --> 01:11:12.000
president you watch and go,
they ain't going to talk to you.

1195
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.730
They're going to out and talk to banks and corporations and everyone who finance

1196
01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:20.410
their fucking campaigns.
You fucking watch.

1197
01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.393
<v 0>All right.</v>

1198
01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.530
<v 3>You saw what happened when Trump tried to pull the troops out of Syria.</v>

1199
01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.560
Both Democrats and Republicans were 100% against that and they act like we can.

1200
01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.570
We can't display very displaced all these people but the,

1201
01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:38.200
but they don't give a fuck.
That's their money.

1202
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:42.130
That money for being in that fucking bullshit over there.

1203
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:47.700
That fucking shit right there is what makes them fucking millionaires,
multi,

1204
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:49.480
multi fucking millionaires.

1205
01:11:49.481 --> 01:11:54.010
And all they do is sit there and blame each other and every mouth breathe and

1206
01:11:54.011 --> 01:11:57.370
fucking moron fucking just believes it,

1207
01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:02.020
drinks the Koolaid and then goes on Facebook and starts arguing with each other

1208
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:07.350
and then starts advocating to tax a fellow American who didn't get us into those

1209
01:12:08.681 --> 01:12:11.410
wars upwards of 70 fucking percent.

1210
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.840
That's the direction we're going to go in and it,
no,

1211
01:12:13.841 --> 01:12:18.370
and at no point are we ever going to examine the banking system or are we going

1212
01:12:18.371 --> 01:12:23.371
to look at corporations and see how they can be reeled back in to actually being

1213
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:28.570
less powerful than the United States government or whatever country that they're

1214
01:12:28.571 --> 01:12:29.404
in.

1215
01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:30.603
<v 0>All right.</v>

1216
01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.280
<v 3>That's the world you enter as president or pope.</v>

1217
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:39.820
Pope of the Catholic Church.
Catholic fucking church.
I mean,

1218
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:45.560
I mean they're one of the biggest fucking terrorist organizations ever.

1219
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:50.270
Ever.
The amount of fucking people that they tortured and murdered.

1220
01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.160
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1221
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.020
<v 3>I mean they were in bed with the Nazis.</v>

1222
01:12:54.021 --> 01:12:57.560
They were hiding one in the Nazis in their fucking churches.
One of the guys,

1223
01:12:57.561 --> 01:13:01.050
one of the fucking,
you know,
PR people,
part of the final solution that the,
uh,

1224
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.450
whose side was hunting down was founded a fucking Catholic church in the south

1225
01:13:05.451 --> 01:13:09.820
of France.
Dead Jewish people's gold.

1226
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:13.810
They had some of that in the church and they had the fucking give that bag.

1227
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.250
I mean,
it's a fucking shit show.

1228
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:16.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1229
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.250
<v 3>So if you get there,
that is a lifetime appointment.</v>

1230
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:25.790
And if you think you're going to go in there and change that when everybody else

1231
01:13:25.921 --> 01:13:28.620
in their previous to has all that blood on their hands,

1232
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.750
like they're not going to view you as a threat.

1233
01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:34.710
<v 0>Um,
yeah.</v>

1234
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.820
<v 3>Those,
which was funny when Trump came in,
he's like,</v>

1235
01:13:37.821 --> 01:13:39.500
I'm going to clean up the swamp.

1236
01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:43.790
Let's just say he actually did have a good heart and he wasn't like the fucking

1237
01:13:43.791 --> 01:13:46.760
Grinch.
Let's just say actually did have a good heart.

1238
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:48.303
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1239
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:51.270
<v 3>That whole thing.
I'm going to clean up the swamp.</v>

1240
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:54.720
Like everybody there who was corrupt was going to be like,
well,

1241
01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:57.270
I guess the party's over.
He's going to clean it up.

1242
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:58.770
No one's going to work with you.

1243
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.880
No one's going to help you cut their own fucking head off.
So,
um,

1244
01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.100
I dunno,
I don't want to end on a depressing note,
but like that is,

1245
01:14:08.101 --> 01:14:12.040
it is a massive,
massive,
massive fucking

1246
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.060
<v 0>problem.
Um,
it's the reason why there's global warming.</v>

1247
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.120
It's the reason of overpopulation.

1248
01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:24.121
All of it goes back to corrupt politician in religion and that's as far as I can

1249
01:14:24.161 --> 01:14:27.610
tell and I'm not a smart guy.
You might know it better than me,

1250
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:32.790
but there is no fucking reason why we shouldn't be polluting much less.

1251
01:14:33.281 --> 01:14:38.080
I was just reading something where like the continent of Africa is going to feel

1252
01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:40.780
the effects the first,

1253
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:45.160
which is the worst fucking continent for that to happen too because with racism

1254
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:49.810
and third boy people view so called Third World countries and everything,

1255
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:53.170
nobody's going to give a fuck until it's in their fucking backyard and it's

1256
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:55.060
going to be fucking too late.
So there you go.

1257
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.540
There's one to grow on and that's why I fucking have gone back to reading

1258
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:02.770
reader's digest,
looking at those dumb jokes,
just playing cards.

1259
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:07.870
It's sitting on my back porch,
smoking a cigar,
staring at a fucking tree because

1260
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:13.510
we're on a runaway fucking train and everybody and everybody who is a passenger

1261
01:15:13.511 --> 01:15:17.560
on the train is blaming everybody else on the other side of the aisle as if

1262
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:21.670
they're the ones driving the fucking train.
Oh my God,
this is depressing.
Anyways,

1263
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.380
that's the podcast.

1264
01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.600
God bless you.
It's almost baseball season.

1265
01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:31.840
Take me out to the ball game.

1266
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.820
I just realized the volume was up super loud because I just took this mixer out

1267
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:40.420
of my luggage.
I hope this wasn't too distorted.
Uh,
God bless you.

1268
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:42.730
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
You cuts.
