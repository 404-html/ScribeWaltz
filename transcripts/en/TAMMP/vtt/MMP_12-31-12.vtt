teeth.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.600
That's how you bring in the new year.

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.770
We'll actually wrote a new year song for you guys this week.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.930
I'm never getting money off this right to you.
Happy.

16
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.783
No,

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.160

18
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.730
Oh fuck yourself.
Hey,
happy new year everybody to,

19
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.860
you know what the great thing about our New Year is?

20
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.090
Cause you just get to say fuck the last year.
Right?

21
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.360
And Act like because the sun's going down and coming up and it's a brand new

22
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.070
year that somehow you're a different person.

23
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.330
Somehow you've learned something from last year without even having to apply

24
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:41.860
yourself.
That's,
that's a big drunk talk.
New Year's Eve.

25
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.550
Dude,
I'm so glad this fucking year resolve it.
This year,

26
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.670
worst year ever fucking wife left me my kids shock.

27
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.070
I fucking cracked up my calf the other day.
Right?

28
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.360
Fucking good rate and stowed dude,
fuck this year.

29
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.970
Right when I love it.
It's the year.

30
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.640
It's not the decisions that Douche bag was making for the last 365 days.
Oh,

31
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.270
it's not that.
It's something about the year to this year.
Just doesn't like me.

32
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.591
You know,

33
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:18.680
like you're breaking up with this year in 2013 is going to be different.

34
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.160
Even though you're going to drink just as much.

35
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.600
You're going to hit on that Chicot work.
Right?

36
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.090
It's still going to smoke a whole fucking,
I dunno.

37
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.870
Sandwich bag of weed every night helps me sleep,
dude.
Right?

38
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.540
You keep telling yourself that lie.
You know
people,

39
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:41.920
if you want true change in your life,
I'm sorry,
what am I a guru?
I'm not.

40
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.383
All right.

41
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.560
<v 0>There's a nice fucking deep groove up to my neck of me doing the exact same shit</v>

43
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:52.570
for the last 44 fucking years.
So who the hell?
Who the hell am I preach?
Um,

44
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.710
I'm just saying if somebody starts that shit with you tonight,
I do.

45
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.430
I'm so psyched.
This year's over.
This was the worst year.
Like did that,

46
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.080
that fucking philosophy.

47
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.520
That's the same philosophy is people who go a see,
there you go.

48
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.720
A bad things come in threes.
Bad things come in threes now.
They don't,

49
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.070
bad things happen.
Bad things happen every day.
The problem is,

50
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.340
the reason why your math works out is every time you get to three,

51
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.000
you just start back over and start saying,
now here's a new group of three.

52
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.470
You can say bad things happen in [inaudible] 17.
You fucking wait long enough.

53
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.100
Say,
there you go.
You know,
that's number 17.

54
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.830
Bad things happen to 17 morons.

55
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.270
They're not smart like me.
Um,

56
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.330
yesterday I actually played drums with a guitar player and a Bass player.

57
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.040
And a,

58
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.210
I realized something is that's just a completely different ballgame and I suck.

59
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.910
So fucking frustrating.
You know,

60
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:58.050
when you sit there playing drums by yourself for fucking ever,
you know,

61
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.200
and just sitting there thinking like,
you know,
you try it out,

62
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:07.201
all this difficult shit play [inaudible] no triplets in fucking five,

63
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.780
no groupings.
That just doesn't work.

64
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.230
All it does is make the people around you turn around and look at you like what

65
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:18.670
the fuck are you doing?
And um,
Oh God,

66
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:22.240
it was frustrating.
It was really frustrating and I've been playing a lot lately.

67
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.010
Um,
I dunno actually played with,
uh,

68
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.850
one of the guys I played with was Mark Marin and Mark Marin can fucking play

69
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:35.380
guitar,
but guy was,
he was killing it was fucking killing it.

70
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.090
So I got to step up my game.

71
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:40.460
I thought I was the best instrumentalists slash podcast host.

72
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.680
<v 3>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.490
<v 0>Um,
and no,
there will be no tapes or video.
What are you think I'm an asshole.</v>

74
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.530
I don't get trashed enough on Twitter.

75
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.090
You know what happened to me or not Twitter the other day?
No Bill,

76
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.410
how would we know?
What do you think?

77
00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:57.490
That's how we build our lives around watching your fucking Twitter account are

78
00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:00.630
right.
Relax.
I was a,

79
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.350
you know,
I'm not big on the social network networking things.
I don't like it.

80
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.580
I don't like talking to people and I,

81
00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:15.581
I certainly don't like Twitter with this whole fucking like this sense of

82
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:20.860
entitlement.
People have that.
I have to go on there and be funny.
You know,

83
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.230
this fucking chick gave me shit.

84
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:27.160
I was sending links to a couple of funny videos that I saw,
you know,

85
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.940
and then I think I tweeted about upcoming show,
God forbid,

86
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.160
you know,
I do something like that and she wrote,

87
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.220
I wish I got fucking had him for me.

88
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.130
She basically wrote for the love of God,

89
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.990
write something funny in the box.
Hits,
sent.
No,
write something in the box,

90
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.520
hit send.
Don't forget to make it funny.
Thank you.

91
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.010
Right?
And Dude,
I swear to God,

92
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.040
I wanted to find this fucking cunt and just choke her to death to the brink of

93
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:00.344
death.

94
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

95
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.800
<v 0>Okay.
Right before she was going to pass out and then ease up.</v>

96
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.390
Let it get a nice fucking

97
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.950
<v 1>okay.</v>

98
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.010
<v 0>Gulf of oxygen and then just blast or in the face.</v>

99
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.150
And I know you were just thinking that's violence against women.
No it isn't.

100
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.830
It's violence against a woman.
Hypothetically.
All right,

101
00:06:19.831 --> 00:06:23.760
so why don't you your group and your website's stand the fuck down.

102
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.530
That's what I wanted to do.
I didn't do it.

103
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.920
You know what are you going to get me for something I was thinking of doing like

104
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.090
that Tom Cruise movie.

105
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.120
Every time I see a brinks truck and I see the fucking guy coming out of the back

106
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.180
with the two bags of money and that guy's sitting there with his pistol is a

107
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:44.660
little pea shooter out of the holster.
Don't you always think that?

108
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.090
What am I just punched him in the face?

109
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.850
Give the other guy leg sweep and just grabbed those two bags.

110
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.040
How fast can you run with two bags of money?

111
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.821
<v 0>You don't,</v>

113
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:57.840
do you think they have a bank robber gym and that's one of the things you do and

114
00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:02.520
they have some social personal trainer,
each one of these bags.

115
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.130
<v 1>Okay,</v>

116
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.620
<v 0>well it's 25 bucks.</v>

117
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.640
You are going to run with these bags up and down that hill because when it comes

118
00:07:11.641 --> 00:07:15.390
to the day that you're going to rob a breaks truck,

119
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.040
you've got 8.5 seconds to get back to that little car.

120
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.760
Okay,
good.
Good leg starts.
Cramping up tight pipe.
Hi.
Not Talking.

121
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.610
Your leg starts cramping up.

122
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.250
You think the cops are going to give you a do over the hey,

123
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.470
you going to be in the fucking price and sale?

124
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.550
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

125
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.980
<v 0>we're sore triceps in a butthole that won't quit.</v>

126
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.090
<v 0>Hey everybody.
I talked to the phone.
Get to 20.
You think that exists?</v>

128
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.590
Um,
anyways,
so

129
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.720
I was uh,
so what do I do?

130
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.410
Usually I don't respond,
but this woman,

131
00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.690
<v 1>yeah,</v>

132
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.560
<v 0>so fucking pissed me off with her.
Chop Chop.</v>

133
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.510
You work for me.
Fucking cunt hair attitude

134
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.440
that I actually wrote back.
I just wrote back,
I said,
I don't think I wrote back.

135
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:15.460
I quit your whining.

136
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:16.820
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.060
<v 0>All right.
But somehow I erased her name,</v>

138
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.450
so I sent that out to everybody who follows me on Twitter.

139
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.980
Quit your whining and then everybody starts trashing me,

140
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.930
says the guy who makes his living Wyman.
Right.

141
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.210
And then everybody's trashing me and I,
I just said,

142
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.270
I can't win for losing on this shit.
You know,

143
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.820
I'm not into this shit of getting heckled off hours.
You know,

144
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.130
I stand on a stage that's on me.

145
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.390
I was dumb enough to go up there and go,
hey,
everybody look at me.

146
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.410
You know,
I don't give a fuck them but this shit where I'm just sitting at home.

147
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.970
You know when somebody talks talking to me like that,
you fucking co where that,

148
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.740
you know,
you know what,
God help the fucking guy that ends up with that woman,

149
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.060
Jesus Christ.
What a fuck it,
you know what I mean?
But I swear to God,

150
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.080
that's how young people are right now.
You know,

151
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.000
they weren't raised right.
Like me and my generation,
we were raised right.

152
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.810
We had to pay for our music.
You know,

153
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.180
if you miss something on TV,

154
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.160
you fucking missed it and you are just stand there at the bus stop staring down

155
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:32.130
at your stride rites.
As everybody talked about the space,

156
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:36.540
1999 episode that you fucking miss last night,
feeling like an outsider,

157
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.290
you know,
not these fucking spoiled brats.

158
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.200
They just grabbed the little smart phones and they just fucking look it up and

159
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:46.410
they all watch it shaking their heads.

160
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:49.800
Ello elling and whatever the fuck it is they're doing.

161
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.620
So now here's this woman who doesn't fuck like she talks,
she's talking to me,

162
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.810
talking to me like,

163
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.100
like she's paying me some sort of salary on Twitter.
Go Fuck Yourself.

164
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.810
Something funny strikes me,
I will tweet it out,

165
00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.510
but I want to give you a link to some woman diving off a cliff and knocking

166
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:16.050
herself unconscious.
I'll fucking do that.
All right.

167
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.350
Whew.
Jesus.
Dude,
I'm so glad.

168
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.900
Fucking 2012 is over.

169
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.280
I had the worst year ever on Twitter.
Um,

170
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.900
anyways,
and to everybody who's listening to this right now,

171
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.960
and then it's going to write the exact same thing on Twitter and think that
that,

172
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:38.280
that's somehow original.

173
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.700
Just know that another 500 people already fucking did that.

174
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:44.040
That's another fucking thing.
You know,

175
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.910
now that you guys have a voice,
the general public,

176
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:53.390
and you can insert yourself into being possibly whatever seen by millions of

177
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.240
people,

178
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.260
why didn't you try to be a little more creative after all your years of bitching

179
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.140
above fucking movies and saying,
oh my God,

180
00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:02.850
how many times can they make that movie?

181
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.950
You wouldn't fucking believe the amount of times I write something on Twitter

182
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.940
and then like 30 people have the exact same clever angle

183
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.880
laughing their fucking asses off while rolling on the floor.
Evidently,
Oh,

184
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:22.860
I'm in a canteen mode.
So anyway,
let's get on with the podcast here.

185
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.040
I barely watched any football yesterday

186
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.030
cause I was too busy hacking away at a drum kit.
I played all right.

187
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.510
He's one of those deals where I played fine and I sounded good,

188
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.010
but I just thought I was so much fucking better.
Jesus.

189
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:45.360
Wasn't that a nice fucking ice bucket of water to the,
did they ego.

190
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.690
Um,
and you know,

191
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:51.510
it's really been bumming me out this whole fucking week.

192
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.940
I hate when people throw out their Christmas trees like the day after Christmas

193
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.690
or two days after Christmas.
Like,
oh thank God that's over.
It's like,

194
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:01.990
what were you just going through the fucking motions?
You know what I mean?

195
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:03.190
You just can't wait.

196
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.150
<v 0>It's quite,
the fucking body isn't even cold yet.
They throw out these trees,</v>

198
00:12:09.151 --> 00:12:12.090
the trees are still green,
you know what I mean?

199
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.300
It's laying on the side of the road with that shocked look on their face.
Like,

200
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.230
oh,
what I do,
oh,
the contract said through the new year,

201
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.620
you know,
I don't know.

202
00:12:22.621 --> 00:12:27.360
Going back to what I was talking about last week about the whole NRA and getting

203
00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:29.880
rid of guns in that type of thing.
And like,
remember I was saying like,

204
00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:33.860
they should have some sort of like test to find out who the sociopath.

205
00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:35.910
So that's kind of a red flag to me.

206
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.220
When you throw your Christmas tree out that quickly,
that means that you,

207
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.040
you don't have any,
you know,
you don't have any Christmas in your heart.
You know,

208
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.050
you don't get that warm fuzzy feeling around the holidays going,
you know what,

209
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:53.080
this is what's really important.
You know,

210
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.260
take a couple of weeks off from the fucking rat race.
You don't,

211
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.420
you're just sitting there with a sweater and a pipe in your mouth and your leg

212
00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:06.070
up on the coffee table laughing at laughing.
When the other humans laugh,

213
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.850
they start laughing.
Then you ha ha
right.

214
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:14.020
Just going through the fucking motions,
you know,

215
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.240
probably got bodies in your basement.

216
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.560
Nobody knows because the fires fucking cracking and there's the Christmas tree

217
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.130
and then the second it's fucking over you close up shop.

218
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.020
I don't know,
it's just,
it's,
it's,
it's fucking creepy to me.

219
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.560
It's a combination of creepy and then I hate people don't dispose of their

220
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:35.290
Christmas trees properly.
All right.
You dispose of it like a body.

221
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.710
He cut that fucker up and you stick it in the green can.
That's what you do.

222
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.280
You don't just throw it out in the street,
you know,

223
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.570
let me just let society deal with it.
That's right.
I used the word society.

224
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.540
I don't think this cough is ever gonna go away.
Um,
overrated.

225
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:56.830
Inhaling mold.

226
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:58.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

227
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.300
<v 0>I actually have another scar that I still want to smoke.</v>

228
00:14:00.301 --> 00:14:04.770
That's how fucked up this is.
It's really bad.
Oh,
by the way,
uh,

229
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:08.510
my dog this week got sick.
I,
I dunno what happened.

230
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.540
She just started like I'm telling you,

231
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.220
if you were going to have a squirt gun,
fight with diarrhea,

232
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.060
like that didn't make sense with shit.
I know what I don't like.

233
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.580
It was,
you couldn't even pick it up.

234
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

235
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.570
<v 0>It was fucking crazy.</v>

236
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.370
We woke up in the morning and she had shit all over the living room.
Poor thing.

237
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:35.200
She was whining in the night
and I didn't hear it.
Yeah.

238
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.220
And uh,
she was trying to let me know like,
dude,

239
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.100
something bad's about to happen.
Right.
And I didn't hear it.

240
00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:45.190
And fucking woke up the next day with like a

241
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.900
lake eerie of shit on the hardwood floors.
Right.

242
00:14:50.901 --> 00:14:53.630
So take her out and she just has the shits for like two days,

243
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:55.760
so we have to go bring her over to the vet.

244
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.140
<v 3>Okay,</v>

245
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.290
<v 0>and by the way,
what's funny is she loves going to the vet.</v>

246
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.890
If you walk into my house,
she will try and rip your head off.
But if you,

247
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.010
if you're at the vet,
because we boarded there a couple of times,

248
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.100
there's something about when she goes to a place where they,

249
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:11.360
she was taken care of.

250
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.160
Like she just loves you forever in anybody who walks in,
she loves them.

251
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:18.350
She fucking loves everybody at the vet.

252
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:23.030
She's got like that old school like blue collar loyalty,
you know?

253
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.190
Hey,
anything you need,
anything you'd a after what you did for me?
No,

254
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:32.270
seriously.
Seriously dude.
After what you did for me.

255
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.100
Okay.
Anything you fucking to look at me?
Anything you fucking need.

256
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:40.250
That's her vibe when she's over there.
Anybody walks through that fucking door.

257
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.860
Okay.
They're cool with you.
They're cool with me.
Then I called you,

258
00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:49.220
you just say the fucking word.
That's her vibe.
She turns in,

259
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.550
she goes from this hell hound.
She comes like,

260
00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:58.350
she's literally dragging me into the vet tail wagon,
comes in,

261
00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:02.040
she puts her paws up on the front desk.
Everybody,
Hey Cleo,
how you doing?

262
00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:05.490
You have kisses for everybody.
I don't know what happened.
She,

263
00:16:05.491 --> 00:16:07.920
if she could just fucking be that way when people came over to my house,

264
00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:10.260
it'd be the greatest thing ever.
So anyways,
we fucking go over there

265
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.400
and a whatever.
So now we got up,
we got to somehow make a eat this pill,

266
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.330
but we do is we just grind it up and we just sprinkle it on a food.

267
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:22.730
So if she's eating that stuff and uh,

268
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.393
you know the deal,

269
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.050
now I got to get some sort of fucking stool sample.

270
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.590
So they gave me this little thing like you'd keep weeding and those little

271
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:34.640
medicine bottles.

272
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.100
<v 3>Okay.</v>

273
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.040
<v 0>Uh,
what's the fucking word?
Summarizing it really just fucking grossed me out.</v>

274
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.870
I pick up the shit in the,
in the shit bag.
There was Rappaport would say,

275
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:47.030
and I just throw it in a barrel.
It's no big fucking deal.

276
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.120
But there was just something about carrying that and like I was keeping it is

277
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.050
just fucking gross.

278
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.320
So the Po and what kills me is I get the stool sample like fucking two days ago

279
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.010
and he is just like,
why did you do that?
I'm like,

280
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.470
I immediately go defensive and like,
cause a fucking doctor said to him,

281
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.500
so now walking around with a vial of shit,
my pocket,

282
00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:10.930
you're giving me a rough time about it.
She goes,

283
00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:14.260
whether or not open until Monday,
I go,

284
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:18.040
well what the f what do I do with this thing?
So actually on my front porch,

285
00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:19.720
I've had a vile of shit

286
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.260
underneath my rocking chair
for like the last two days.

287
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:30.520
It's probably frozen solid.
And uh,

288
00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.290
I don't know what I'm going to do.
You know what I mean?

289
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.460
I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to hell.

290
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:35.690
I'm going to just tell Nisha to bring it over.
That's what I'm going to do.

291
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:37.930
If I'm going to pass off the fucking responsibility.

292
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.790
He also told me I need to start brushing your teeth.
So I've been doing that.

293
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.490
And I don't know if you've ever tried to brush your dog's teeth.

294
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:47.540
It's the funniest thing.

295
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.510
Like you'll laugh your ass off as it's happening unless you get frustrated

296
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:54.720
easily,
which I do,
but not with the animals.
You know,

297
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.630
you can't get frustrated with a dog that fucking hilarious.

298
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:03.150
So the second you start brushing their teeth,
their tongue,
they just start going.

299
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.040
So the whole time you're trying to brush their teeth and they can't stop.

300
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.550
It's like give a,
give a dog peanut butter and they sitting there fucking

301
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.750
whatever you call licking their chops for like the next 20 minutes.

302
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.740
That's what she's doing.

303
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.520
And I'm laughing my ass off and I can't get a fucking front teeth cause they're

304
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:24.480
stupid tongue keeps going like in and out and then it becomes like a,

305
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:25.650
that sounded disgusting,
didn't it?

306
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.353
<v 4>Mold.</v>

307
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.463
<v 1>Okay.</v>

308
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.630
<v 0>MMM.
I really should get checked out,
shouldn't it?</v>

309
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

310
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:40.450
<v 0>Yeah,
but that's not what guys do.
We don't get checked out.
Something bad happens.</v>

311
00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:45.280
You just fuck you push through it.
If it came up in athletics,
you know,

312
00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.910
you just push through the fucking pig.

313
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

314
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.770
<v 0>That's why we die earlier.
You know,
I think my eyes are starting to go,</v>

315
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.980
am I going to go to the doctor and go look and get some glasses?

316
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.271
How funny is that?

317
00:18:57.271 --> 00:19:01.680
Even been making fucking nerve fun of nerds all this year and then my Karma is

318
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:03.060
now,
I might need glasses.

319
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.740
Could somebody please Photoshop some pictures of me with different glasses on?

320
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.300
I just want to see what I'm going to look like,

321
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:12.780
how bad the heckling is going to be because somebody said,

322
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.010
well why don't you just get contacts second.
I don't want to work context.

323
00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:18.170
That's like having a toupee.

324
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:23.280
He said that fucking thing stuck to your head underneath your head's all sweaty

325
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:26.370
and shit.
Like I don't get people who were fucking toupees like why would you,

326
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:29.700
it's like having a hat on forever.
You know?

327
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.820
I always wondered about people who have to pays like at night.

328
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:35.070
Do they just take it off like,
oh,

329
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.520
just fucking sit there fucking scratching this skull.

330
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.800
The top of your head smells like hockey stuff.
I know it's gross.

331
00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:47.840
This has been a gross podcasts,
but I'm just saying

332
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.510
I don't get the fucking to pay at all.

333
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.330
I don't get hair plugs cause they look horrific.

334
00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.080
But they got this new way of doing it now where they vacuum the hair out of the

335
00:20:00.081 --> 00:20:04.940
back of your head and then they just parrot troop it on to the top of your head.

336
00:20:04.941 --> 00:20:07.910
And that's the first thing I've ever considered.

337
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.620
<v 0>Where I've just been like,
you know what?
When they do it that way,</v>

339
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.970
it looks natural.
But then they sent me a video of the,
uh,

340
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:22.220
the actual procedure dude.
And it's like right out of silence of the lambs.
It,

341
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:26.100
there's so much fucking blood you wouldn't believe it.

342
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.270
This is just been disgusting.
This has just been shit,

343
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.330
blood violence against women.

344
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.890
And then there was a slight fucking beastiality thing is I'm talking about my

345
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:42.270
tongue,
a dog's tongue going in and out,
just the way I said that,
whatever,

346
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.480
whatever.
I'm just getting out all the bad stuff.

347
00:20:45.481 --> 00:20:50.050
So two 2013 one did the three z can be the best fucking year ever for all of us.

348
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.940
You know,
that felt very cultish.
Um,

349
00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.070
the fuck was I just talking about

350
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.190
the hell was I talking?
I said,
I can't even remember.
My brain just goes forward.

351
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.630
That's it.
It's gone.
It's over.
There's nothing we can do.
What happened?
Ah,

352
00:21:11.631 --> 00:21:16.210
they just did just web Tommy.
Um,
anyway,

353
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:20.570
speaking of very cultish,
I was a,
I didn't watch any football yesterday,

354
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.690
so,
uh,
you know,
I didn't really have anything to talk about,

355
00:21:25.691 --> 00:21:30.520
so I figured I would watch a little bit of news.
So I went to a,
the CNN one.

356
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:31.810
I figured I'd do that one next week.

357
00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:36.040
I'll watch the Fox News just to keep it fair and balanced,
you know,

358
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.600
and uh,
they got this hilarious thing for Anderson Cooper.

359
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.680
They go,
Anderson Cooper is keeping them honest.

360
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.690
I didn't know what it means and he's got this fucking look on his face.

361
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.000
It's keeping who honest.

362
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.410
What does Anderson Cooper think he's doing with his little field trips over to

363
00:21:56.411 --> 00:22:01.000
like different parts of the world with his bulletproof vest on and his hair is

364
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:04.480
still perfect.
God,
I'm jealous of his fucking hair.

365
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.340
I would take his full head of hair,
all white.
I would take it.
I would take that.

366
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.700
I would take just that and leave the sides red.
I do it.

367
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.810
I'd walk on stage looking like Jay Leno.
Fuck Steve Martin Right now,
right?

368
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:28.290
They both have grey hair.
Let's see.

369
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.060
Uh,
you,
you,
you do the fucking math.
Anyways.

370
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.580
The fuck am I talking about here?
Did I lose this thought?
Oh yeah.

371
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.180
So Anderson Cooper's keeping them honest.
Right?
You gotta Watch,

372
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:46.440
I gotta send you the link to the fucking look on his goddamn face.

373
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.920
Like he really believes he's keeping people honest.

374
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.180
Who is he keeping honest?
Like he's invested,

375
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.450
let's say invest a major corporation.
Do they go,

376
00:22:57.451 --> 00:23:01.620
Oh fuck Anderson Cooper's here.
I mean,

377
00:23:01.621 --> 00:23:02.730
I don't know how tall the guy is.

378
00:23:02.731 --> 00:23:05.730
He looks like one of those five foot eight guys with small hands.

379
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.290
It doesn't even look like that,
you know,
five,

380
00:23:10.291 --> 00:23:14.430
eight little small hands.
So you know,
to make up for it,

381
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:18.630
God gives him a perfect head of hair.
You know,
had I been two inches smaller,

382
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.180
you know,
with the hands I had in sixth grade,

383
00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:25.970
he would have let me keep my hair.
He would have you,
he wouldn't let me do it.

384
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.440
That's how it works.
It's in the fine print of having a soul.
Um,
so anyways,

385
00:23:30.441 --> 00:23:31.880
they got Anderson Cooper there,
right?

386
00:23:31.881 --> 00:23:34.490
And he evidently he's keeping keeping them honest.

387
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.490
That's about as vague as you can get.
Oh Damn.

388
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.840
Keeping them honest.
Don't lie to me.

389
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.630
That's like when,
what the fuck was it there?

390
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.700
Five hour energy.

391
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:54.050
He had the little pink bottles and then they said a portion of the proceeds goes

392
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:58.670
to fight breast cancer.
Well,
what percentage?
We don't deal in percentages.

393
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:03.710
Portion
cut you in a little slice.
Um,

394
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.000
so anyways,
so I'm watching this shit on the F FLDS church.

395
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.590
I have no idea what it is.

396
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.630
It's yet another group of people who had the audacity to start their own church

397
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.120
and have somebody that they listened to blindly,
you know,
and uh,

398
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:24.910
evidently they were predicting that the end of the world was coming
and uh,

399
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.800
so they had their own grocery store in the center of town,

400
00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:32.570
this little small town and they don't fuck they fucking closed.

401
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.380
They closed the grocery store doubt.

402
00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.690
And then the authorities are going like the,

403
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.350
the report is going to the authorities,

404
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.040
the authorities going now is this a bad sign?
You think this is a bad sign?

405
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.090
And the guy's like,
yes,
we definitely think this is a bad sign.

406
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.830
We feel like it's suggesting that they feel the world is ending.

407
00:24:49.831 --> 00:24:52.170
So there's no need to buy groceries anymore.

408
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.180
Sorry about the coughing guys.
Um,

409
00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:05.090
first of all,
on two levels,
that story's fucking annoying.

410
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.710
First of all,
that you could be dumb enough to follow another fucking human being

411
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.410
that who's basically doing the ultimate dude.

412
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.160
I called it basically predicting,
not,
you know,

413
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:25.690
like what I'll predict that the Broncos,
and uh,

414
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.060
I was going to say the Greenbay packers,
but he was like,

415
00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:33.660
what about Seattle's defense?
But I don't like their quarterback,

416
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.220
so I'm going to say the fucking Green Bay packers will somehow be able to score

417
00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:41.130
enough fucking points against that amazing Seattle defense.

418
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.840
And it's the revenge factor.

419
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.530
Cause fuck the Seattle Seahawks and Pete Carroll

420
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.520
and he's not doing ric flair.
I just did ric flair.

421
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.390
He,
Carol's when they score a touchdown goes,

422
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.330
it's really long.
It's horrific.

423
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:09.530
So because they have one more victory in the ledger than they actually deserve.

424
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.270
I'm saying Greenbay goes in there,

425
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.960
whether it's in Seattle and they're artificially loud stadium,

426
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.570
you know,
with that 12th man,
the Douchey,

427
00:26:21.571 --> 00:26:26.400
his thing and football,
the 12th band,
they need us,

428
00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.900
you know,
they do everything but give their fans palm pumps anyways,

429
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.390
great fucking defense.

430
00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:38.250
So fucking great defense by the way that they made the 40 niners with that

431
00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:41.880
second year quarterback look like.
The 49 is what the second year quarterback,

432
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.720
unlike the Patriots'
Let some score 31 points.

433
00:26:45.721 --> 00:26:47.580
Am I still fucking bummed about that?
Yes I am.

434
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.870
Although I saw some shit yesterday what their pass rush,
you know,

435
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:57.270
then maybe we're seeing the future that would really help out our corners.
Um,

436
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.500
so that's what I'd call.
So anyways,
back to this fucking church.

437
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.140
So you're dumb enough as an adult to follow another fucking person that says

438
00:27:06.141 --> 00:27:07.280
they know what's going to happen.

439
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.160
But then what was bugging me too was this reporter,
he's walking around,

440
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.570
nobody wants to talk to him and he's sitting there harassing him and he's like,

441
00:27:16.571 --> 00:27:20.560
the ladies were were polite,
you know,
unlike the men.

442
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.970
And it's like,
no,
you're sexually attracted to females.

443
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:28.390
See coming at them with the different vibe you came at.
The guy's like a cunt.

444
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.820
And then also with guys is always like that,
hey,

445
00:27:30.821 --> 00:27:32.470
I'm going to punch you in the face vibe.

446
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.860
This guy sitting there talking about the difference between men and women,

447
00:27:35.861 --> 00:27:39.570
like an 80s comic or something.
Wait,

448
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:42.480
did I just do it too before I trashed him for doing it?
I don't fucking know,

449
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.130
but this is the thing,
this sitting there going like,
you know,

450
00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:52.131
watching what's going on with this church and I guess their leader is already in

451
00:27:53.731 --> 00:27:58.080
jail.
I don't know what he did.
I have no fucking idea.

452
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:03.140
But I got to up big sense that a lot of it had that he had the audacity to start

453
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:04.170
his own fucking church.

454
00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:07.530
Eventually you're just going to end in jail or they're going to burn you down

455
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.040
and then they go and brings up a conjures up images of Jim Jones and David

456
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:15.960
Koresh.
That's what I love about these things.

457
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.780
Why don't they ever bring up mainstream religion too?
Like my religion,

458
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:27.650
you know all the murder and crap in fucking child molestation and all the shit

459
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:30.420
that like my religion is horrific.

460
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.520
The inquisitions getting in bed with the Nazis.
I mean,

461
00:28:35.521 --> 00:28:36.540
just write down,

462
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:40.800
if you go right down the most Judas moments in history,

463
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.730
there's going to be a rep from my church sitting right there with his little red

464
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:48.540
hat on.
Or maybe the big white one,
the big steeple hat.

465
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.270
I Dunno.
I don't understand why they just don't leave these fucking people alone.

466
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.420
Just leave him alone.
If people want to start a fucking church,

467
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.560
let him start a church.
And if they want to think some regular guy is Jesus,

468
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:06.570
let him.
And if he tells them all to go drink a bunch of poison,
let them

469
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:14.620
what?
What?
What are you saving?
You know what I mean?

470
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.850
And you know something like our compassion in the long run is going to kill us.

471
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.470
All right?
We're,
we're fucking overpopulated.
All right?

472
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.190
And because we're so good at Madison,
the fucking week survive.

473
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.560
If you're fucking dumb enough to drink a fucking glass or ripple or whatever the

474
00:29:32.561 --> 00:29:33.430
fuck you drinking,

475
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:37.803
what,

476
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.070
because some guy told you that there's space ship coming.

477
00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.653
<v 3>Okay?</v>

478
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.940
<v 0>If you're fucking dumb enough to do that,
you shouldn't be here.</v>

479
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.520
Let's say now I don't have a right to say you shouldn't be here,
but like it's,

480
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.470
it's good for the herd that you exit as soon as possible.

481
00:29:57.471 --> 00:30:02.440
That's how I look at it.
You know,
polar ice caps are melting.

482
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.360
Everything's made out of corn.
Now,

483
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.740
would it really be that bad if a bunch of fucking people who are dressed like

484
00:30:09.741 --> 00:30:13.250
Quakers,
following a guy who says he's the Messiah,

485
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.610
if he tells you to fucking kill yourself,
if they just killed themselves,

486
00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:19.760
whether it be like you go in and then you save those people and then where do

487
00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:23.310
they go?
What?
All of a sudden they're smart.

488
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.440
Do you send them through some sort of don't believe another human being the next

489
00:30:28.441 --> 00:30:30.840
time they say that Jesus class,
they don't.

490
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.440
They just go in and save them and then they just let him out again to go out and

491
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:40.050
do the same shit all over again.
I've just let it,

492
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.630
it's like bankers Yak,

493
00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:45.690
like you're fucking outraged and then what do you do?

494
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.840
You get in the fucking houses back.
None of them go to jail.

495
00:30:48.841 --> 00:30:51.540
They get the houses back again.
To do the same bullshit all over again.

496
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.600
So you know what it is.
People without reading,

497
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:58.260
without even being remotely intelligent,
I have the whole world figured out.

498
00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.200
You got to match.
As much as I've been preaching on this podcast,
I,
I do realize

499
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.110
I'm going to cop myself.

500
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.770
I'm going to compliment myself for realizing that I'm a Douche.
Jesus Christ.

501
00:31:10.771 --> 00:31:12.870
What's with my ego today?
You know what it is.

502
00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:17.850
I need a boost after embarrassing myself or just not playing well yesterday on

503
00:31:17.851 --> 00:31:21.050
drums.
Like literally like in my head,

504
00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:26.051
I was to the point that if ever when like if I ever got called to do a fucking

505
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.920
drum and Gig that I could actually pull it off.

506
00:31:30.921 --> 00:31:32.390
Like that's where my fucking ego was.

507
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.270
<v 3>Okay.</v>

508
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.940
<v 0>I Dunno.
Anyways,
let's get on with the advertising for this week.
Everybody.</v>

509
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:41.590
We got some quickies here,
uh,
over the holidays.
Um,

510
00:31:41.591 --> 00:31:45.730
amazon.com everybody if you'd like to support this podcast,
um,

511
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.500
I gotta do is go to bill bird.com.

512
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.390
Click on the podcast page and then there's a link over to the right for Amazon.

513
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.020
Click on that brings you right to Amazon.
Everything's the exact same price,

514
00:31:56.021 --> 00:31:58.360
but if you buy something after he goes through my website,

515
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.590
percentage of the proceeds,
they kicked me something,
right?

516
00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.910
And then I fucking kick a portion of that to a,
for the wounded warriors project.

517
00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:11.320
It's been a great thing and I want to thank everybody for doing it this entire

518
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.890
year and last year it's been awesome.
And,
uh,

519
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.030
is there one other one?
I'm the fucking worst.
I never know.

520
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.550
amazon.com was there one other one?

521
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.260
I think I don't give a shit.

522
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.700
<v 3>Okay.</v>

523
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.533
<v 0>Was there one?</v>

524
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.880
It's the holidays.
What are you going to do anyways?
Let's plow ahead here.
Um,

525
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.250
what else did I want to talk about?
Oh,
I actually got a feeling that,
uh,

526
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:46.770
<v 7>now that the Broncos have home field advantage,
dude,
they're looking like that.</v>

527
00:32:46.771 --> 00:32:48.130
They could possibly do it.

528
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.480
<v 4>Okay.</v>

529
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:54.310
<v 7>You know,
I was hoping the giants were going to make the,
uh,
the playoffs because,</v>

530
00:32:54.311 --> 00:32:58.180
um,
I had this,
this football fantasy,

531
00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.990
not fantasy football.
It's a football fantasy.
All right?

532
00:33:01.991 --> 00:33:06.310
So don't get a fucking twisted.
I had this football fantasy that,
uh,

533
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:11.430
the Patriots somehow with their defense win the championship this year and Brady

534
00:33:11.951 --> 00:33:16.620
beats both manning brothers.
He Beats Peyton like he always does.

535
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.190
And then he beats fucking Eli for the first time,

536
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.240
even though he fucking should have beat him last year.
You have fucking model.

537
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.130
Sorry.
Um,

538
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:26.990
<v 4>yeah,</v>

539
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.810
<v 0>but the giants didn't make the playoffs,
so what are you going to fucking do?</v>

540
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:34.990
You know,
what are you gonna do it?
But I,
I don't,
um,
I dunno.

541
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.870
I liked the Gronk is back,
but I don't like our,
uh,

542
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.350
I just don't like our fucking defense,
you know?

543
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.130
I still think we're at least a year or two away.
I've said it every fucking week.

544
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.670
And uh,
you know,
when you play that fucking game,

545
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.270
we're going to score 35 points before you do.
It just doesn't work in January.

546
00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:55.540
There you go.
I've said my piece and speaking of Boston Sports,

547
00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:01.180
I'm really getting into the Celtics now.
This is how much I like punishment,

548
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:06.180
like right as is,
they're tapering down as they're spiraling down.
I actually,

549
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.033
um,

550
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.360
<v 4>okay.</v>

551
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.550
<v 0>You know what it is.
I like the building of the castle,</v>

552
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.580
not standing back looking at it like I like watching the Celtics right now cause

553
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:17.930
I like trying to figure out what their problem is.

554
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.060
And as far as I can tell is we have absolutely no defensive presence.

555
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.800
Nobody's afraid to go to the rack.
We got nobody.
You know,

556
00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:30.740
Garnette has fought enough wars for the love of God.

557
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:32.180
Can you get the guy some help?

558
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.670
We got absolutely spanked by the fucking clippers the other night.

559
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.890
I watched that whole God damn game.

560
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.310
I know a lot of people shut it off or whatever,
but uh,

561
00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.460
I'm really glad I didn't go to that game cause that would have been it really

562
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:47.294
annoying.

563
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:49.163
<v 4>MMM.</v>

564
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.190
<v 0>To listen to all those La fans fucking trash in the South Dixon and I would know</v>

565
00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:56.430
that,
well I can't say that they're right because they would just be going,

566
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.350
you know,
Celtics are bitches and that type.

567
00:34:58.351 --> 00:35:00.030
They wouldn't be like breaking down the game,

568
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.740
but that's not what they do out here.
They just say your bitches and then,

569
00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.370
you know,
I don't know what three people stomp on a father with his,

570
00:35:08.371 --> 00:35:11.280
with his two kids there.
That's what,
that's what La fans though.
So what they do,

571
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.280
but for some reason Philly fans keeps getting respect,

572
00:35:14.281 --> 00:35:17.040
like they're the craziest people ever.
Um,
anyways,

573
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.120
but like I was just watching that game and I was our record at that point.

574
00:35:23.761 --> 00:35:26.130
I became like 14 and 14 and I was like,

575
00:35:26.131 --> 00:35:31.131
that is the exact record that we should be because we are a middle of the pack

576
00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:33.630
team.
And um,

577
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.000
<v 4>I dunno,
went up to</v>

578
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.730
<v 7>golden state last I saw I was what was working that night.</v>

579
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.920
We were down by like 17.

580
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.320
It's a rough road trip for us,
but um,

581
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.050
I'm going to enjoy watching us try and put it back together and Danny Ainge did

582
00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:55.730
at one time.
I'm hoping he can do it again and uh,

583
00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.200
it's going to be fucking brutal.
But as long as the,
uh,
you know,

584
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:01.780
<v 3>yeah,</v>

585
00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.530
<v 7>as long as the Lakers don't win it,
I think I'm good.
I think I'm good.</v>

586
00:36:05.531 --> 00:36:09.520
I'm actually slowly becoming a Knicks fan because they're on TV all the fucking

587
00:36:09.521 --> 00:36:13.840
time.
So that Jr Smith Watch the replay of that game,

588
00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.330
hit those two ridiculous shots,
one to win it.

589
00:36:16.331 --> 00:36:20.770
And I can't remember who the fuck they beat cause I'm so not an NBA fan.
But um,

590
00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.350
Nick's can't beat the bulls though
so far.
They can't.
All right.
I'm in,

591
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.350
I'm in way over my head.

592
00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:28.990
I'm just starting to watch it because evidently thinks will be no fucking hockey

593
00:36:28.991 --> 00:36:30.640
this year.
You know,

594
00:36:30.641 --> 00:36:33.760
I got this great tradition out every year when the Bruins come to town and they

595
00:36:33.761 --> 00:36:36.550
play the kings,
I go there with a bunch of buddies of mine.

596
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:40.750
We just have a great time and an la king fans are cool.

597
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.930
They're great fence.
They're not decks or whatever,
you know.

598
00:36:43.931 --> 00:36:45.910
And I don't go there wearing all my Boston shit,

599
00:36:45.911 --> 00:36:48.460
just trying to be an obnoxious asset share on the Bruins or whatever.

600
00:36:48.461 --> 00:36:49.300
But I'm not a cunt.

601
00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.230
I would go there and congratulate the kings fans on their championship because

602
00:36:53.231 --> 00:36:55.630
of know they're good people.
I don't have a problem with them.

603
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.130
<v 3>Okay.</v>

604
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.960
<v 7>Um,
so anyway,
so let's,
let's get on with some,
um,</v>

605
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.510
some fucking questions for the week here.
Uh,
Bill Finland,
uh,

606
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.460
get your show to Finland asap.

607
00:37:07.461 --> 00:37:11.270
Could use some gloves here in this freezing country.
Sincerely,

608
00:37:11.271 --> 00:37:13.880
all the fins.
You know what sir?

609
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.640
Normally I would trash you for acting as though you speak for your entire

610
00:37:19.641 --> 00:37:21.010
country,
but,
uh,

611
00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.740
the fact that you're inviting me saying that everybody there wants to go.

612
00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:30.020
I'll take that.
I'll take that nice fucking blow to the ego in a good way.
Um,

613
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.180
I'm actually,
uh,

614
00:37:32.181 --> 00:37:37.181
I came up with a great idea for how I'm going to tour that part of the world,

615
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.790
um,
next year and I'm going to run it by my agent on that.

616
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.270
Literally on the second I got a great idea of great promotional way that I'm

617
00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:50.600
going to try and fucking do that.
And um,

618
00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:56.740
I definitely want to come over there again without a fucking doubt because I

619
00:37:56.741 --> 00:38:01.660
went to Anderson Cooper who was keeping everybody honest and I realize why I

620
00:38:01.661 --> 00:38:05.710
don't fucking watch the news.
It was just,
it's a,

621
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.370
what do we got here?
Here's some sort of the top fucking stories,

622
00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:12.640
but bus skids down in Bankman kills nine

623
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:18.590
so I put that on and it was a bunch of people on a bus coming back from Las

624
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.040
Vegas going all the way up to Vancouver.
You know what I mean?

625
00:38:22.041 --> 00:38:23.870
And that's one of those things right there where I just,

626
00:38:23.871 --> 00:38:27.260
you just makes you not believe in a God,
you know?

627
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:31.220
Or maybe God was like they've had enough,
but it's like,
isn't it enough?

628
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:32.970
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

629
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.890
<v 7>that you know,
you're obviously man,
what the fuck kind of money you make.</v>

630
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:39.550
And if you got to take a bus from Vancouver all the way down to fucking Vegas,

631
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.850
right?
You didn't win enough money to buy a fucking ticket to fly back.

632
00:38:44.851 --> 00:38:47.280
You get back on the God damn bus just sitting there.

633
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.140
Hundred bottles of beer on the lawn or bottles of beer going all the way fucking

634
00:38:52.141 --> 00:38:55.500
back with maybe with a bucket full of quarters that you wanted some slots isn't

635
00:38:55.501 --> 00:39:00.150
that enough?
You got to slide down a fucking embankment.
And that's the thing.

636
00:39:00.151 --> 00:39:02.220
It killed nine people.
They don't talk about all the other people.

637
00:39:02.221 --> 00:39:05.070
Probably had injuries that they're,
you know,
lifelong going to be nagging them.

638
00:39:05.071 --> 00:39:09.540
It's just brutal.
They had that.
They had the guy who said he's Jesus

639
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.980
dying.
Mom's youtube.
Goodbye.
Right?

640
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.300
I didn't even watch that one.

641
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.210
Five-Year-Old finds porn on Christmas gifts.

642
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.720
Dad Delivers Breech baby on side of road.
They go,

643
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:31.930
they always give you one to fucking,
you know,
for every 10 horrific ones,

644
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:37.170
listen to pilot explained stuck in the mud.
I had to watch that one.

645
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:43.030
Some southwest pilot was taxiing to go off to go take off and he just fucking

646
00:39:44.341 --> 00:39:49.341
drove off the runway and that now the FAA is going to investigate what happened.

647
00:39:49.381 --> 00:39:52.470
Isn't it obvious what happened?
He was texting,

648
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.840
you know who hasn't done that?
He was texting.

649
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:02.840
It's too early in the flight to talk your way into a fucking hand job.
You know?

650
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.550
That's the only other thing that could be distracting you to that point.

651
00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:11.290
How does that happen?
He played patty cake with the fucking copilot.

652
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.870
I want to hear that black box.

653
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.530
I bet the the engineer does it still three people up there.
When I was a kid,

654
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:19.000
there was this one guy back,

655
00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:22.280
they would just turn some knobs because the other guys just sat there with their

656
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:23.710
mustaches waiting to take off.

657
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.460
Did that other guy who turns the knobs as they're sitting there playing,
you know

658
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:33.320
Eddie and Johnny sit near a tree when they were fucking doing that shit.

659
00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:35.930
Is that a patty cake song?
I Dunno.
Um,

660
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.130
that's gotta be on the black box.
Whatever song they were singing,

661
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.630
whatever the fuck they were talking about.
And then the guy in the background,

662
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:47.510
guys,
guys,
guys,
guys,
guys.
And then they go into the mud.
Oh,

663
00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:51.300
maybe it was the guy who sits behind
guys,
guys,

664
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.560
here's my impression.

665
00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.220
This is fucking Michael Jackson meets and they're turning around and looking at

666
00:40:56.221 --> 00:40:57.054
it.

667
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.410
Is there anything more pathetic than the wheels on a plane?
You know what I mean?

668
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.410
You ever see like when somebody buys like a fucking brand new pickup,

669
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.580
but they get the most,

670
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.190
the bare bones version and they basically have like the pocius looking tires you

671
00:41:14.191 --> 00:41:16.530
ever,
they can't even fill up the wheel.
Well,

672
00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:20.760
you literally can see that the coils in the side of the engine,
the tires,

673
00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:25.410
so fucking small,
there's nothing more like that.
Then then the wheels on a plane,

674
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.080
they're just sad and pathetic.

675
00:41:28.081 --> 00:41:31.080
And I always wondered why they didn't get bigger rims.
Uh,
wait a minute,

676
00:41:31.081 --> 00:41:35.270
am I talking about a soul plane?
Right.
You know what?

677
00:41:35.271 --> 00:41:36.890
I think they had that right.
You know what?

678
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:39.320
Some nerds actually probably gonna write him actually though.

679
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:43.340
The weight of the rooms would actually,
you fuck the other vector?

680
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:48.260
Is that the right word?
Um,
all right,
let's get back to here.
Finland.

681
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.260
I'm definitely coming over there.
Hopefully in the next year.

682
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:52.910
My calendar is filling up.

683
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.170
I'm just waiting for the links so I can tell you guys where I'm coming.

684
00:41:57.171 --> 00:42:00.050
I guess it wouldn't harm if I could tell you guys what cities I'm going to,

685
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.560
would you like a teaser?
Um,
here's the deal.

686
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:06.700
I can tell you some that I'm definitely going to be at right now.
All right.

687
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:11.870
I'm going to be at flappers comedy club in Burbank,
California on January 10th.

688
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.650
I'm going to be at the republic in Hawaii.
Honolulu,

689
00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:20.570
Hawaii on January 26th I'm going to be at the Wilbur Theater in Boston,

690
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:25.550
Massachusetts.
February 21st and 22nd I can't give you dates here,

691
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.310
but just to perk your ears up in case you hear your city,

692
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:30.080
this is like school cancellations.

693
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:34.400
[inaudible] back in the day when you're waiting to hear your town and for all

694
00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:38.960
use all they use who don't live in a state or a part of the world.

695
00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.010
Whereas school would get cancelled because of snow.

696
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.410
We used to listen to it on the radio,
right,

697
00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:46.710
<v 3>okay.</v>

698
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.850
<v 7>Are or watch the news or something like that.</v>

699
00:42:48.851 --> 00:42:53.020
And there would be like the following schools have been canceled,

700
00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:54.770
Dota,
whatever,

701
00:42:54.771 --> 00:42:59.620
Snow fall and they will be like Winthrop north Redding,
Redding.

702
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.050
You'd just be sitting there,
fall river,
just waiting for your s,
you know,

703
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.080
and then they,
they get to whatever,
whatever your town began with,

704
00:43:08.081 --> 00:43:10.150
whatever letter and you just fucking sitting there.

705
00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:12.850
It was the greatest thing ever.
No school because of snow.

706
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.630
You didn't have to fake sick or anything.
So anyways,
here we go.

707
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.890
Here's the list of cities so far.
Then I'm going to be at starting in March.

708
00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.350
I don't,
I can't give you,
I guess I can give you dates.

709
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.610
Uh,
March 7th through the ninth,
I'll be in Madison,
Wisconsin,
Milwaukee,

710
00:43:29.611 --> 00:43:32.340
Wisconsin in grand rapids,
Michigan.

711
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.920
March 22nd 23rd,
I'll be in Indianapolis and then Minneapolis

712
00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.500
and April I'll be in Atlanta,
Tallahassee,

713
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.390
Miami Beach,
Austin,
Texas,
Dallas and Kansas City.

714
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:51.470
I haven't been there forever in VA and a May.

715
00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:55.950
I'll be in Las Vegas at the Mirage Red Bank,

716
00:43:55.951 --> 00:44:00.860
New Jersey,
Baltimore,
Maryland,
eastern,
wherever the fuck that is.

717
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:03.710
Atlantic city's that all jersey.
Uh,

718
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:08.270
I'll be in Chicago in June also in Pittsburgh.

719
00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:15.000
I'm going to be a bunch of places.
Hyannis Hampton,
Newport,
this is July Montreal.

720
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:20.190
Foxwoods in August
in November,
Philly,

721
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.220
New York City and Washington DC.

722
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.830
If your city was not called then you have school.
Um,
and that,

723
00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:30.780
that's it so far.
So somewhere in there.

724
00:44:30.781 --> 00:44:33.600
I'm going fucking slam a European trip in there and now it's all going to be

725
00:44:33.601 --> 00:44:35.520
good.
But back to the podcast,
everybody,
sorry.

726
00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:37.650
I feel like the funny hasn't been coming here for a few minutes.

727
00:44:37.651 --> 00:44:41.610
Let me see if I get back to it.
All right.
Self deprecating bill.
Hey Bill.

728
00:44:41.611 --> 00:44:43.770
I can't keep from hating myself.

729
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.370
I have like obsessive self hatred and no matter what I accomplished,

730
00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:51.780
some dark part of my brain is always going to shit on it.
Uh,

731
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:55.800
you think some insecurity would help push me to better myself,

732
00:44:55.801 --> 00:44:59.070
but this is too such a to such a severe degree.

733
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.540
I can hardly function because of the resulting anxiety and stress.

734
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.870
I have a feeling you can relate to an amount of this.
Yeah.

735
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.200
He really went out on a limb there,

736
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:15.520
<v 0>especially since you're also a musician and shit on your playing ability as much</v>

737
00:45:15.521 --> 00:45:16.480
as I do mine.

738
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:21.750
And was hoping you could offer some advice in how you try to remain positive if

739
00:45:22.301 --> 00:45:26.610
you fucking even do thanks.
Merry Christmas.
Um,
all right.

740
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:31.060
Merry Christmas to help.
We had a good Christmas.
Um,
well you've actually,

741
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:34.840
I think you've,
you've,
you've,

742
00:45:34.841 --> 00:45:37.260
you've gone over the toughest hurdle so far.
One of the,

743
00:45:37.261 --> 00:45:40.810
one of the hardest hurdles.
The first one is actually addressing

744
00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:45.070
that.
You know,
that you do that.

745
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.020
One of the hardest things to do is to stand outside yourself and sort of watch

746
00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:55.021
your thoughts and watch how your brain is functioning rather than just thinking

747
00:45:55.691 --> 00:45:56.290
a thought,

748
00:45:56.290 --> 00:46:01.290
taking it as law and then letting your body go into a state of anxiety and

749
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:05.860
stress and all this stuff that you're talking about.
Um,

750
00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:11.520
what I try to do to try to stave off those demons is I just,

751
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.640
I just try to,

752
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:14.960
<v 1>mmm.</v>

753
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.140
<v 0>Just analyze my thought process when I'm starting to think negative and</v>

754
00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:20.531
everything.

755
00:46:20.531 --> 00:46:25.531
I just kind of just almost take like a timeout and just literally be like,

756
00:46:25.811 --> 00:46:28.300
okay,
now if I actually

757
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:32.190
like take that that thought is law.

758
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:36.480
Like how is that going to make me feel and how is that going to help me this
day?

759
00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:40.620
Whatever this day is.
December 31st,
2012 is only going to happen once.

760
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.170
Is it going to be another one in the shit column?

761
00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:47.580
Or I can make it positive and then I just try and,
I don't know,
go to the gym,

762
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:53.520
go play drums,
do something fucking positive,
try new joke or something like that.

763
00:46:53.521 --> 00:46:58.290
But what I,
I try not to do is fucking,
I dunno,

764
00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:01.980
just let that thought grabbed me by the neck and just pull me down to the bottom

765
00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:05.190
of the lagoon.
It's really like a choice,
unless she has,
I guess,

766
00:47:05.191 --> 00:47:08.370
some sort of clinical depression where it's literally like a chemical at which

767
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:12.540
point I'm in way over my head and you should go see a doctor.
So I would,
um,

768
00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.490
<v 1>okay.</v>

769
00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:16.323
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

770
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:20.650
Did your parents suck where they assholes where they always shitting on

771
00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:24.100
everything you did or maybe they loved you,
but like they had a,

772
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:28.300
they had a fearful way of looking at the world and they always came up with

773
00:47:28.301 --> 00:47:32.080
something negative.
It's something like that,
but at some point you got to go,

774
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.760
you kind of got gotta turn the bus around.

775
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.983
<v 8>MMM.</v>

776
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.660
<v 0>I mean that,
that would just be my advice.
That's kind of how kind of,</v>

777
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:43.270
how it works for me.
But,
um,

778
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:45.700
<v 4>okay.</v>

779
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.533
<v 0>I Dunno,</v>

780
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.040
I feel like in the middle of the night I have my most negative thoughts and I'm

781
00:47:50.041 --> 00:47:54.820
just fucking tossing and turning or part of it.
And,

782
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:59.550
um,
Nia told me last night said,

783
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:03.060
you okay?
She worked.
We have goes,
are you okay?
And I said,
yeah,
why?

784
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:04.460
<v 4>Okay.</v>

785
00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.360
<v 0>She goes,
you were moaning,
moaning,</v>

786
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.690
like moaning to me is like,
like sexual.
And she's like,
no,

787
00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:19.520
not like that.
Like you were in pain.
So I dunno,
but then when I wake up,

788
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:25.820
I always,
I dunno,
I,
I,
I'm always in a positive mood when I wake up,
you know,

789
00:48:25.821 --> 00:48:28.730
cause I wake up with next to my girl,
I see her and then I see my dog.

790
00:48:28.731 --> 00:48:31.670
My dog wants to go out and I,
so I started off in a real positive thing,

791
00:48:31.671 --> 00:48:34.790
but there's something at night,
my demons come out at night.

792
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.220
I don't know what it is.
I have like fucked up dreams.

793
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.420
I always have dreams where I'm beating the shit out of the person,

794
00:48:41.421 --> 00:48:44.930
but I can't fucking get them to like,

795
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.430
just stay down.

796
00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:51.620
They just keep getting up or I'm throwing punches really fucking slow and they

797
00:48:51.621 --> 00:48:54.710
have a knife and they get to try and kill me,
but they can't,

798
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:58.160
they can't quite kill me and I can't quite knock 'em out.

799
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.603
<v 8>MMM.</v>

800
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.940
<v 0>I don't know.
And I don't know what any of that fucking means.</v>

801
00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:07.750
And I went to therapy and all that shit.
And uh,
after a while I just,
you know,

802
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.260
I was just like,
you know,
you can't shine shit.
What?

803
00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:17.050
I'm just wasting my money here.
Jesus,
that was brutal site.
Um,
all right,
bill,

804
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:21.280
I hope that helps you a little bit.
Uh,
I would read books about positive thought.

805
00:49:21.281 --> 00:49:22.630
I'd go to therapy.
I would,

806
00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:26.350
I would literally attack your depression like you had it.

807
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:27.940
Like somebody who has a weight problem,

808
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.120
starts going on a treadmill and starts eating.
Right.
I would literally,

809
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:34.760
rather than just sitting there filling the hopelessness of it,

810
00:49:34.761 --> 00:49:38.260
I go on the attack and um,

811
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.380
<v 4>yeah,</v>

812
00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.400
<v 0>I really hope you turn it around do because life doesn't give a fuck.</v>

813
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.620
It sucks.
Like it doesn't care if you have a bad life.
It's,
it's all on you.

814
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.300
You got to come up with a game plan and that can be overwhelming.
But like,

815
00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:57.590
just,
you know,
the whole fucking cliched one day at a time,

816
00:49:57.591 --> 00:50:00.200
but life doesn't give a fuck if you don't get the girl.

817
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.670
It doesn't give a fuck if you become homeless.
It's,
it's not,
you know,

818
00:50:04.671 --> 00:50:08.180
that whole Guardian Angel Horse Shit that this little Tinkerbell on your

819
00:50:08.181 --> 00:50:12.920
shoulder trying to guide you.
It's bullshit.
It's,
it's,
it's on you.

820
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.680
I know that that can be overwhelming,
but it's,

821
00:50:15.681 --> 00:50:18.710
it's a powerful way of looking at your life.

822
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:23.000
Like you have the control to make it good or bad,
you know?

823
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:27.950
And I'll be selling my books on tape.
Uh,
dental billion.

824
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.760
I recently,
I recently watched a talk show appearance.

825
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:35.540
You posted on your Twitter you mentioned?
Yeah,
I did the,
uh,

826
00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.500
the Willie Hunter show.

827
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:38.443
<v 8>MMM.</v>

828
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.290
<v 0>And I think that that's what I posted when that fucking Twat that I'd like to</v>

829
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:47.160
choke to death with a garden hose sent me that tweet.
Um,
yeah,

830
00:50:47.161 --> 00:50:48.470
it was on the Willie Hunter show.
And he said,

831
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:50.420
you mentioned you were a dental assistant.

832
00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:52.270
<v 8>MMM.</v>

833
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.860
<v 0>For your father.
Did you ever consider becoming a dentist?
Did you ever,</v>

834
00:50:55.930 --> 00:51:00.670
did your father ever have ambitions for you to become anything in particular?

835
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:06.340
Um,
no.
My Dad,
my parents were great.
Like they,

836
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.760
they wanted you to base,
they didn't force anything on you.

837
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.980
It was like whatever you wanted to do.

838
00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:13.923
<v 8>MMM.</v>

839
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:20.410
<v 0>They supported it 100% and I remember being working with my dad and in the</v>

840
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:24.800
dental office when I told him that I was going to become a comedian,

841
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:28.670
we were in like the break room and I remember I was sitting there like going

842
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:29.504
like,

843
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:34.930
how is this guy going to take this when he has such a classic,

844
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:36.310
<v 1>okay,</v>

845
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:37.960
<v 7>like stable job here.</v>

846
00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.820
You know that I'm going to tell him that I'm going to fucking

847
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.410
basically make a living,

848
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:52.430
try to make a living doing exactly what he's been yelling at me for for the last

849
00:51:52.951 --> 00:51:54.420
fucking 20 years of my life,

850
00:51:54.421 --> 00:51:59.421
which was fucking off and acting like an idiot and screwing around all the shit

851
00:51:59.681 --> 00:52:02.290
that you know,
when he would give me Christ,

852
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.870
check that box you're in a town clown do you would be giving me shit,

853
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:11.880
which I totally deserve because if you ever saw the grades I got in school,

854
00:52:11.881 --> 00:52:16.530
I mean they,
they,
they are,
they are horrific.
Fucking horrific.

855
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.810
The high water mark for me was like a c minus or a c like I was,

856
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.633
it was brutal.

857
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:24.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

858
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.040
<v 7>I went to it had to go to summer school every fucking year of high school except</v>

859
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.300
my sophomore year.

860
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:30.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

861
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.070
<v 7>Because my math teacher hooked me up in my senior year.
I should have gone.</v>

862
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:36.620
I just didn't give a fuck.
I was like,
what's the point?
You know what I mean?

863
00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.800
That's like you got the ball with 10 seconds left and you,

864
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:44.300
what are you going to do?
You just fucking,
you know,
you're down by 30.
Yeah.

865
00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:47.300
Just throw up a half court shot.
Did it go in?
Who gives a fuck?
It doesn't matter,

866
00:52:47.301 --> 00:52:48.890
you know?
Um,

867
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:50.890
<v 1>yeah,</v>

868
00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:53.680
<v 7>so no,
I mean for half a second.
You know what,
you know what I did like,</v>

869
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.580
I like the,
uh,
I like the pouring up models.

870
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:02.080
When I was in a,
when I was in the dental office,
that was my favorite thing.

871
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.180
I was in the back,
I was isolated.

872
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:07.930
I wasn't around anybody and it tapped into that little kid thing of playing in

873
00:53:07.931 --> 00:53:08.764
mud

874
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:15.400
and he used to pour up the models and they had this vibrating thing and you had

875
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:18.370
to tap on it to make sure you've got all the bubbles out.

876
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:22.370
And I prided myself on not yet

877
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.760
<v 0>being able,
you know,
of having it without no having no bubbles.</v>

878
00:53:26.761 --> 00:53:29.990
So if you've got bubbles,
if there was bubbles on the bottom,
basically,

879
00:53:29.991 --> 00:53:32.380
you know when they stick that pink shit in your mouth and they got to take a,

880
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.080
an impression of your teeth,

881
00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.130
then somebody's got to take that out of your mouth going in the back room and

882
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:38.640
then you got it.

883
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.930
You got to mix this powder with water up in those little green rubber balls.

884
00:53:42.931 --> 00:53:44.490
Jesus,
this is all coming back to me.

885
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:49.590
And then you poured it into the fucking impression you took and then there was

886
00:53:49.591 --> 00:53:49.890
this,

887
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:54.720
this thing that sounded exactly like your cell phone vibrating on a table and

888
00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:58.320
you just,
you just tapped it on that to get all the air bubbles out of it.

889
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:04.280
And if you didn't do it enough after one of the things set and you took it out,

890
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.680
um,
if the bubbles were at the bottom,

891
00:54:07.681 --> 00:54:09.670
that's where the teeth were the most crucial thing,

892
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:14.310
the exact fucking thing that trying to get a gauge on so they can,

893
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:18.480
you know,
whatever the hell they were trying to do,
make a bridge or something.
Um,

894
00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:20.550
the whole thing would be fucked.

895
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:26.300
And then you couldn't go and just rapport the model into that same mold because

896
00:54:26.671 --> 00:54:30.060
somehow like it had shrunk up a little bit and it wouldn't be accurate.

897
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:35.640
And my dad used to flip out.
He would,
he would take them off and be like,
Christ,

898
00:54:35.641 --> 00:54:36.474
there's bubbles,

899
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:44.820
you know?
And it was beyond your boss yelling at you.
It was also my dad.

900
00:54:44.821 --> 00:54:47.130
So I already had,
you know,

901
00:54:47.131 --> 00:54:52.131
I was going through my fucking teenage and early twenties when you're rebelling

902
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:53.650
the most against your fire.

903
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:56.370
Already had the live with the guy and then I was working with the most fucking

904
00:54:56.371 --> 00:55:01.110
hilarious and he used to give me shit like,
you know,

905
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:04.440
like I was his kid,
but we really have,

906
00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:08.730
we actually talked about how we had to tone that shit down because it didn't

907
00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:12.720
come off as professional in front of patients,
so whatever.
But um,

908
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.110
but that was the part I thought if I ever got into dentistry that I would,

909
00:55:16.111 --> 00:55:20.790
I would,
I would work in the lab.
I liked that part of it,
like,
um,

910
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.700
and not just pouring up the models like the actual,

911
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:28.770
I know there was a precision to it that I liked.
I didn't like to fight.

912
00:55:28.771 --> 00:55:29.880
I didn't like the,
uh,

913
00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:33.390
the front line shit going in the mouth with all that crap and looked at people's

914
00:55:33.391 --> 00:55:36.570
fucking horrific teeth,
just horrible fucking teeth.

915
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.940
All my jokes were about that shit when I first started.

916
00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:41.860
I told you guys that story,
right?

917
00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:45.670
I used to work totally clean when I first started stand up.

918
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.870
Um,
and not because I wanted to be this comedy purist.

919
00:55:49.871 --> 00:55:53.290
I just was afraid of offending somebody in the crowd,
getting heckled,

920
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.910
not having a comeback,

921
00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:58.660
losing my place in my act and then bombing horrifically.

922
00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:00.190
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

923
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:04.870
<v 0>And,
and just having my career end,
total fear,
catastrophizing,</v>

924
00:56:04.871 --> 00:56:08.080
like way of looking at it.
And um,

925
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.750
yeah.
Oh Jesus Christ.
That really just fucking brought me back to,

926
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:17.610
I was standing on stage at stick stitches.

927
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.270
Fucking somebody heckled me was that the vault and Boston.

928
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:23.680
So we had called me and I completely lost my fucking train of thought

929
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.820
<v 7>and I had nothing and I didn't.
And it took me like basically three seconds to,</v>

930
00:56:28.821 --> 00:56:33.280
to,
to re to remember what the fuck I was talking about.
And um,

931
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.810
it was the longest 30 seconds in my life and I didn't know enough to just say to

932
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:40.270
the crowd like,
what the fuck was I talking about?
Because they'll tell you,

933
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.460
they'll remember it.
They're not nervous,
they're listening.
They,

934
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:47.710
they're not having like this outer body experience.
Uh,
but anyways,

935
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.860
I remember people would come into the dental office and their teeth would just

936
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:54.790
be just,
just what an absolute fucking mess.

937
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.360
<v 0>And they can tell you right now,
I hate coming to the dentist.
It's like,</v>

938
00:56:59.361 --> 00:57:01.460
yeah dude,
I can smell it.
You don't have to smile.

939
00:57:01.461 --> 00:57:02.840
I can tell you don't like coming to dentist.

940
00:57:02.841 --> 00:57:04.310
You only like fucking brushing your teeth.

941
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

942
00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:08.160
<v 0>Oh,
just one guy said this,
one of the first jokes I did.
Oh,
that's right.</v>

943
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.960
So I would work totally fucking clean.
And then my last at my,
and you just,

944
00:57:12.961 --> 00:57:15.600
you know,
when I looked like a young Ron Howard,

945
00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:20.660
I look like Richie Cunningham and I was totally clean and I was clever and I had

946
00:57:20.941 --> 00:57:25.800
these perfect talk show monologue jokes and everyone was gone like,
oh dude,

947
00:57:25.801 --> 00:57:27.770
you're going to do the tonight show and this is going to be

948
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:31.620
<v 7>perfect than Blahblahblahblahblah.
And then the last joke in my act,</v>

949
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:37.840
I quoted this patient who kept having to get fillings and root canals and he,

950
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.360
and he said,
doc,
you know,
I don't understand what's going on.
I mean,

951
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:45.130
I brushed my teeth almost every day.
And then my,

952
00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:47.290
my snappy comeback to that,

953
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:50.770
that I thought of that later became the last joke of my act.
I said,
really deal,

954
00:57:50.771 --> 00:57:53.170
wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit.

955
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:56.830
And that's what I would close with after working totally clean.

956
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.170
I would say that disgusting lie.

957
00:57:59.171 --> 00:58:02.530
Do you wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit?

958
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:07.531
Having everybody in the crowd after looking at this fucking Norman Rockwell come

959
00:58:08.801 --> 00:58:09.634
to life,

960
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.930
fucking character wholesome is hell right.

961
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:19.950
And I really was back then as opposed to the piece of shit that I am now after

962
00:58:20.861 --> 00:58:24.070
20 years on the road that I became,
um,

963
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:25.820
<v 1>okay.</v>

964
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:29.840
<v 7>And I literally,
they had to conjure up pictures of somebody skipping,</v>

965
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:32.240
wiping their ass and just that hold and they would

966
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:36.460
<v 0>just literally recoil.
Then I would just be like,
you know,</v>

967
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:40.970
thanks a lot.
Good night everybody.
You were great.
And um,

968
00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:42.690
<v 1>okay.</v>

969
00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:45.240
<v 0>I had another horrible one that I did,
uh,
were,</v>

970
00:58:45.241 --> 00:58:48.690
I actually brought a prop on stage and if you'd like to see that,

971
00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:49.690
I tell the story,
the

972
00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:54.690
<v 7>Willie Hunter show and a willys an up and coming comic at the comedy store.</v>

973
00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.190
And he's the guy who threw the Hula Hoop,
took the hula hoop from that girl in.

974
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:04.090
Fucking threw it into the street.
I tell that story too.

975
00:59:04.091 --> 00:59:08.720
If you want to see that shit,
check out his shell.
I tweeted about it.
Anyway,

976
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.030
so let's plow ahead here.
Winding down here on the podcast.
Um,

977
00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:15.040
fight question bill.

978
00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:19.990
So we in this kid decided that we would have a little boxing match.
That's funny.

979
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:25.220
How,
how quickly before that went from the,
the,
the parameters that you guys said.

980
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.370
All right.
No real hidden here.
Just kind of body shots.

981
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:32.930
How quickly before it turned into just complete anger.
Anyways,

982
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:36.260
he said he didn't know that I hated him.
Ah,
dude,
you're evil.

983
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.510
You're a fucking evil dude.
So mean.

984
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.160
This kid decided that we'd have a little boxing match.

985
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.810
He didn't know that I hated him.
Fuck you dude.

986
00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.250
You want it to beat the shit out of this kid.
You talked him into it.

987
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:53.090
Just the fact that you said a little boxing match and you're trying to like tone

988
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:56.930
down.
You and this kid decided that you would have a boxing match,

989
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.140
a little boxing match.
He didn't know that I hated him,

990
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:03.320
so I was determined to rock his fucking dome.

991
01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:04.920
<v 3>Okay.</v>

992
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.150
<v 7>But we start fighting and he's kicking the shit out of me.
That's hilarious.</v>

993
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:09.961
He goes,

994
01:00:09.961 --> 01:00:14.961
I finally hit him right in his temple and his fat ass gets knocked the fuck out.

995
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

996
01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:17.381
<v 7>Um,</v>

997
01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:22.210
about a week later he found out that he broke his hand on my face.

998
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:27.870
So he tells all the bitches that he actually won because he broke because he

999
01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:31.600
broke his hand and couldn't punch that hard after he broke it.

1000
01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.940
Does that sound like bullshit to you?

1001
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.253
<v 8>MMM.</v>

1002
01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:42.260
<v 7>I don't know.
It kind of seems like you guys all,
you both got what you deserved.</v>

1003
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:49.160
You fucking hated them.
So you wanted to fight them.
Evidently he's a Douche.

1004
01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.053
<v 8>MMM.</v>

1005
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:57.000
<v 7>So he got knocked out and his hand got broken.
He fucked you up a little bit.</v>

1006
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:58.170
And then,
uh,

1007
01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:00.040
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1008
01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.370
<v 7>now he's walking around bragging about it.
But yeah,
it is bullshit.</v>

1009
01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.330
It is bullshit.
You won that fight.
You knocked him out.
You took what?

1010
01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:11.800
You took his fucking punches,
you know,
and then,
uh,

1011
01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.230
I just really like I was being an asshole there.

1012
01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.840
You weren't asking me if either one of you guys was the bigger con.

1013
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.180
You're just asking who won the fight.
You definitely won the fight.

1014
01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.880
He definitely won the fight and he's fat.
So you went in on two different levels.

1015
01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.950
So you,
as far as I see you,
when you got two belts,
you got the,
uh,

1016
01:01:29.951 --> 01:01:33.610
the fighting of the boxing belts and you got the,
I'm in better shape than you,

1017
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:39.040
so congratulations.
You know what she could do?
You could fight him again,

1018
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.620
although you would be risking losing,

1019
01:01:41.621 --> 01:01:44.980
cause it sounded like he was getting the best deal in the beginning.
But

1020
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.123
<v 8>you know,</v>

1021
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.890
<v 7>why don't you guys do that?
Why don't you have your fucking,
your trilogy,</v>

1022
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.540
maybe he wins the next one.

1023
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:56.840
Then you have the rubber match and then you put it on local cable access.

1024
01:01:56.841 --> 01:02:00.620
Paper view,
right?
You pet your charge a little bit of money.
No,

1025
01:02:00.621 --> 01:02:03.380
you charge tickets.
This is what you do.

1026
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:08.960
You got to become friends with that fat Douche.
All right,
and you do just,

1027
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:12.800
what boxes do you pretend?
You know,
like you have this animosity,

1028
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:17.250
like you don't have this deal.
Like there's not a big fucking,
I mean you,

1029
01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:20.190
you really do have the animosity but,
but there's a bunch of money

1030
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.830
<v 0>at stake.
So he talk a bunch of fucking Shit,</v>

1031
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.573
<v 4>right?</v>

1032
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:29.000
<v 0>So more people show up to the next one.
All right,</v>

1033
01:02:29.001 --> 01:02:33.770
and you take a dive and the next one you let the fat fuck beat Ya.
So now,

1034
01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:35.120
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1035
01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.270
<v 0>everybody's choosing and you say that he cheated and you say fuck you.</v>

1036
01:02:38.271 --> 01:02:40.610
And then you say,
I'd beat you the first time.
And he says,
fuck you.

1037
01:02:40.611 --> 01:02:45.020
I broke my hand.
I could have one.
You build up to all this big fucking hissy fit.

1038
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.860
Then you have the rubber match and all of you guys know that this one's real and

1039
01:02:51.081 --> 01:02:54.950
you charge everybody a dollar.
You fucking have it at the local rec place.

1040
01:02:54.951 --> 01:02:56.630
Do you guys even have rec rooms anymore?

1041
01:02:56.631 --> 01:03:00.380
You're too busy on your fucking smart phones playing video games.
It says,

1042
01:03:00.381 --> 01:03:02.000
is there a place where you hang out?

1043
01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.760
Then you got that kid in your grade who already has a mustache.

1044
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:11.740
He buys booze for everybody,
right?
You charge money for the booze.

1045
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:13.270
Maybe that's what you do.

1046
01:03:13.271 --> 01:03:16.810
Somehow you make a little bit of money out of it and then Al for the rest of the

1047
01:03:16.811 --> 01:03:19.750
time,
when you go back to your high school reunion,

1048
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.620
it's going to be this awesome thing that you did this fucking entertainment.

1049
01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.110
You know,
you might be slurring a little bit,

1050
01:03:26.111 --> 01:03:29.080
but I think that would be great to have your own fucking Thrilla in Manila.

1051
01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.730
Just my 2 cents.
All right,
here we go.
Hire a ref.

1052
01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:35.890
Maybe one of your friends works at Athlete's foot,

1053
01:03:35.891 --> 01:03:40.570
so you already has the fucking shirt.
You know?
See what I'm saying?

1054
01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:43.690
There's a whole wonderful world out there of entertainment.

1055
01:03:43.691 --> 01:03:45.610
If you guys get your faces out of your smartphone,

1056
01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.460
go back to do what we did when we were kids.

1057
01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.690
You didn't virtually punched somebody in the head.
You did it for real.
Um,

1058
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.020
you know,
I,
I got to go to a doctor.
I can't even laugh without coughing anymore.

1059
01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:02.520
Sound like a fucking minor.
All right?
Soon to be brother-in-law Douche.

1060
01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.770
Okay.
Here's the situation.

1061
01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.540
My wife has an older sister and she's been dating the same guy for nearly 20

1062
01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:11.374
years now.

1063
01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.660
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1064
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:14.130
<v 0>I was literally thinking about something else,</v>

1065
01:04:14.131 --> 01:04:16.650
so I don't even know what I just said.
I got to reread this.
Okay.

1066
01:04:16.651 --> 01:04:20.100
Here's the situation.
My wife as an oldest sister,

1067
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:25.020
and she's been dating the same guy for nearly 20 years.
All right.

1068
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.820
My wife has only eight,

1069
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:30.210
was only eight years old when this guy started to come around the house.

1070
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:33.810
So naturally she becomes close to him because she was always,

1071
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:37.860
she was always hanging around her sister and this guy is over for the next few

1072
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:42.840
years.
Okay,
I get it.
Um,
let's jump ahead now to where I come into the picture.

1073
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.310
When I start dating my wife,

1074
01:04:44.311 --> 01:04:47.820
we hung out with her sister and her fiance at the time a bunch of times,

1075
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:52.440
but this guy is a know it all and a materialistic prick.

1076
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:58.260
So I quickly knew me and this guy would never hang out other than at family

1077
01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:01.500
functions and get togethers,
which is totally fine.

1078
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.810
That's totally fine.
You got a good head on your shoulders.
That's exactly it.

1079
01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:10.980
All I gotta do is smile and wave with some eggnog in my hand once a fucking
year,

1080
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.600
maybe at a birthday or maybe a cookout and then that's it.
Um,

1081
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:21.390
and I suggest not getting drunk at those events because a,

1082
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.440
your real thoughts will probably come out,

1083
01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.750
at least in the car ride home when you sit in the,
I can drive,

1084
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.570
I could drive and then it's going to be all of that shit.
Whatever.

1085
01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:34.840
I didn't want to go anyways because he's a fucking digging.

1086
01:05:34.841 --> 01:05:37.090
You're gonna have that whole thing.
Anyways,
here we go.

1087
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:41.650
After a few years of dating,
we buy a house in or about to get married.

1088
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.800
Okay,
Bill,
sorry for the boring shit so far.
But here's,

1089
01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:46.210
here's where the story starts.

1090
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:51.460
Now it comes a time where you have to pick people to be in your wedding party.

1091
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:53.080
I have three brothers and thrill,

1092
01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:57.880
real three real close friends that I would consider brothers and I could only

1093
01:05:57.881 --> 01:06:02.290
pick five because that's the number that we had that we came to make things even

1094
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:06.340
out.
We are not rich,
so we couldn't afford a giant wedding.

1095
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:11.700
So it's pretty obvious that I have the slots filled and still have one close

1096
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:16.600
person left up.
We're here.
Comes to part with a douchebag.
Sister's boyfriend.

1097
01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.920
Yeah.
Boyfriends because they called off the wedding four years ago and got back

1098
01:06:20.921 --> 01:06:25.180
together.
Just recently engaged again this Christmas.
Um,

1099
01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:29.470
she makes a giant stink about not being,
oh,
he makes a giant what

1100
01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:31.311
this is.

1101
01:06:31.311 --> 01:06:35.540
The other guy makes a giant stink about not being asked to be the best man.

1102
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:39.560
Yeah,
I said the best man.
Yeah,
this guy's a dick.

1103
01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:41.750
This fucking cunt really expects me to,

1104
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.260
to put him as my best man at my wedding.

1105
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.710
I'd never even hung out with this moron in like four years.

1106
01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.790
And like I've mentioned,

1107
01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:54.500
these spots were already filled with friends being left out anyways.
Oh,

1108
01:06:54.501 --> 01:06:56.330
other people feel like they've been left on anyways,

1109
01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:01.460
while his side of the story is that he treated my wife like a sister even better

1110
01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:02.570
than his own sister,

1111
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:05.870
and he felt that my wife should have included him until the wedding party.

1112
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.030
Now to be fair to my wife,
dude,

1113
01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:11.300
I don't need to read the rest of this fucking goes on forever by the way.

1114
01:07:11.301 --> 01:07:12.410
It's like another to listen.

1115
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.050
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1116
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:18.580
<v 0>It's your wedding out of a courtesy to you.
I guess I got to read some of this.</v>

1117
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:24.050
I think this has to be a reason why this was sent to me and it's his fucking

1118
01:07:24.051 --> 01:07:27.350
long.
Do you guys want to hear the rest of it?
Come on.
You probably have stewed.

1119
01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.560
You want to hear the rest of this feed out?
Click off.
I don't give a fuck.

1120
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.950
All right.
Well the hell was I.

1121
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.500
I'm not to be fair to my wife,

1122
01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.910
she did tell me what he wanted her to do and she knew it wasn't going to happen.

1123
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:44.570
So obviously he was not going to be in the wedding party.
Instead,

1124
01:07:44.571 --> 01:07:47.750
we asked for him to be an usher.
That's hilarious.

1125
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:52.250
Is standing in the back of the church,
stupid,
whatever the fuck you call it.

1126
01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:56.720
When you're that guy that helps the old ladies to their seats and whatnot.
Dude,

1127
01:07:56.721 --> 01:08:00.860
I think that's even funnier than not having a minute.
Um,
so anyways,
well,

1128
01:08:00.861 --> 01:08:04.400
not only did he decline,
he also refused to go to the wedding entirely.

1129
01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:05.810
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1130
01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:08.240
<v 0>What a fucking bitch.</v>

1131
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:10.643
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1132
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.670
<v 0>You know what?
He's got that Colby gene.</v>

1133
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.550
Unless he's scoring 30 he doesn't want to be a part of it.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1134
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:18.321
Anyways,

1135
01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:22.980
I didn't give a fuck because the guy is to a conversation with a smelly yogurt

1136
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:25.740
gushing.
Okay.
All right.
I didn't want it.

1137
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.020
I didn't want anyone in my family or any of my friends.

1138
01:08:29.021 --> 01:08:32.450
Never know this guy exists.
Okay.
So basically you're like awesome wedding.

1139
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.990
Now I won't get into all the stupid shit this guy did over the next year,

1140
01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:38.150
but he started a bunch of bullshit in the family,

1141
01:08:38.151 --> 01:08:41.990
including two particular phone calls to my wife in which he spent two hours

1142
01:08:41.991 --> 01:08:46.290
screaming and belittling my wife about him not being in the way.

1143
01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:51.780
This guy's crazy mixed with a whole lot of other held in frustrations this guy

1144
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:57.980
had.
If you ever wonder,
wondering what my wife's sister does about all this,

1145
01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:02.540
the answer is nothing.
She's a jellyfish,
standing idly by or man,

1146
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.120
sad motherfuckers.
But anyways,

1147
01:09:05.121 --> 01:09:08.180
I was cool planning on never seeing this asshole again,

1148
01:09:08.181 --> 01:09:13.090
except maybe at the inevitable funeral or something like that,
so,

1149
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:17.080
well,
he just popped the question again to the jellyfish.
They're get.
Yeah.

1150
01:09:17.081 --> 01:09:20.650
He probably asked her to get married just so he could not invite you.

1151
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.210
He goes,
now this is the ball flicker of this email people.

1152
01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:27.560
I'm in the last paragraph,
by the way.

1153
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.680
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1154
01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:32.820
<v 0>The word is,
he's going to ask me to be his best man.
Oh,</v>

1155
01:09:32.821 --> 01:09:34.160
you went the other?

1156
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.260
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1157
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.330
<v 0>Oh my God.
Dude.</v>

1158
01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:41.480
You realize this psycho is probably getting married to this woman.

1159
01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:45.530
He doesn't even love.
He asked her.
He,
Oh my God,

1160
01:09:45.531 --> 01:09:47.510
this guy is a fucking sociopath.

1161
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.210
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1162
01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:53.160
<v 0>wow.
Wow.</v>

1163
01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:57.960
Just to rub it in my wife's face like he's the better person assumption,
dude.

1164
01:09:57.961 --> 01:10:02.140
Turn him down.
Just you.

1165
01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:04.360
You got to clear the fucking air.
Be like,
dude,
I don't,

1166
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:08.380
you're not my best man because I don't like you.
Anyway.
He goes,

1167
01:10:08.381 --> 01:10:12.220
it's bad enough that I wanted to capitate this dude already for the Shitty said

1168
01:10:12.221 --> 01:10:12.731
to my wife,

1169
01:10:12.731 --> 01:10:16.300
but how the fuck am I going to handle it when he asked me to be his best man?

1170
01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:17.920
Obviously I'm not going to do it,

1171
01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:22.770
but I'm just wondering how you would tell him to fuck himself in such a way that

1172
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.310
then it will bother him,

1173
01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:29.311
deepen his brain to the point where he can't sleep at night because of how badly

1174
01:10:29.891 --> 01:10:33.220
he was pumped.
This guy thinks his shit don't stink already,

1175
01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.410
so it's not as simple as,
no,
I won't be a best man and go fuck yourself.

1176
01:10:38.411 --> 01:10:40.270
He would win in my eyes if that happened.

1177
01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:44.530
I need some heavy duty ammo for this fucking flaming narcissist.

1178
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:49.810
All right,
dude,
this guy is drawing you in to a trap.

1179
01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.240
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1180
01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.270
<v 0>All right.
He's drawn you into a trap.</v>

1181
01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.510
Have you ever told your wife to be that you don't like the guy?

1182
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:04.200
Just say,
listen,
I respect the fact that what he is to you,

1183
01:11:04.201 --> 01:11:09.200
but I just don't get along with the guy.
Okay,
and I,
it's in,

1184
01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:10.560
it's your wedding.

1185
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:15.480
You have the right to pick the best man and the fact that the guy throws a

1186
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:20.481
fucking hissy fit that he's not the best man is beyond psychotic.

1187
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:27.030
It's beyond psychotic behavior.
Okay,

1188
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:32.570
and and just tell your wife that the reason why you're declining to be his best

1189
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:37.350
man is because you feel that it's not coming from the heart.

1190
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:43.100
He's actually using a major portion of his wedding as a way to try to get even

1191
01:11:45.331 --> 01:11:49.980
like tit for tat and try to make you look like a bad guy do this guy's just a

1192
01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:54.900
complete cycle.
All right?
You love this girl.

1193
01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:56.160
You want to get married to her.

1194
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:59.850
You guys have the right to pick who you want to pick and everybody should honor

1195
01:11:59.851 --> 01:12:03.450
that.
And the fact that this guy not only cannot handle it,

1196
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:07.960
he's been calling up in screaming
at,

1197
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:12.320
at your wife rather than you,
rather than being a man.

1198
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.060
I would just ask the guy to go out and have a drink

1199
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.630
and just sit the guy down and just say,
listen,

1200
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:24.770
you've been screaming at my wife for the last year.

1201
01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.390
Okay.
That alone,
I don't want to be your best man.

1202
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.200
I don't want to be your best man
because you yell at my wife.

1203
01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:42.550
That's why for me to be your best man would then be like me saying it's okay for

1204
01:12:42.551 --> 01:12:47.470
you to yell at my wife.
Okay?
You shouldn't have asked me to be your best man,

1205
01:12:47.471 --> 01:12:51.650
which you should have done is you should be a man and go apologize to my wife.
I,

1206
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:54.010
I would.
I would go some route like that,

1207
01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.260
but the worst thing that you can do is get drawn into this thing where now

1208
01:12:59.261 --> 01:13:02.710
you're trying to come at this guy like,
oh,
he's going to try and get me.

1209
01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:03.880
I'm going to try and get him.

1210
01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:09.130
This guy's going to win because he's drawn you into this fucking trans guys out

1211
01:13:09.131 --> 01:13:12.940
of his fucking mind.
You guys have a wedding.
You picked your best man.

1212
01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:16.660
He couldn't handle it.
He screamed at your wife.
That didn't work.

1213
01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.860
So now he's getting married and now he's asking you to be his best man.

1214
01:13:22.330 --> 01:13:27.140
I don't even think you talked to the guy.
Just talk to your wife.
Just be,
listen,

1215
01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:30.050
I don't know what this guy's deal is,
but he's,
he's,
he's freaking me out.

1216
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.200
This guy freaks me out.
I don't know what his deal is.
Okay.

1217
01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:36.120
I have a right to pick my best man.
I did.
Um,

1218
01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.550
this guy should have been a gentleman and it accepted it.
Instead,

1219
01:13:40.551 --> 01:13:44.090
he called up and berated you numerous times for a couple hours on the phone.

1220
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:48.350
I wanted to say something to him,
but I didn't want to disrupt the family.

1221
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:52.160
I was a gentlemen and now he's asking me to be his best man in to,

1222
01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:56.480
to just decline them.
Just say,
no,
I don't.
I,
I don't want to do it.

1223
01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:02.660
Just leave it at that and then let him pow.
Just let that guy keep pouting,

1224
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:08.500
but don't get drawn into the emotion of it and then think that you have to have

1225
01:14:08.501 --> 01:14:12.010
an epic.
No.
Just say no.
I don't want to do it.
All right.
Jesus Christ.

1226
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.580
<v 7>Hour and 14 minutes.
This is the longest fucking podcast ever.
Um,
all right.</v>

1227
01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:19.810
That's a podcast for this week.
Everybody.
Happy New Year.
Um,

1228
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.140
2013.

1229
01:14:21.141 --> 01:14:25.360
It's going to be better than ever if you make an effort,

1230
01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.040
if you make an effort to,
if I'm not even getting into this fucking horse shit,

1231
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:31.360
I don't even believe it myself.
All right?

1232
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:36.220
You are who you are fucking accepted and fucking settle in for another year of

1233
01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:39.190
this bullshit.
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1234
01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:43.600
I'll try to get the mold out of my goddamn system by next week.
All right.
Oh,

1235
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:47.950
rose bowls tomorrow,
so please do not sleep on next week's podcast.

1236
01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:49.360
We're going all out once again,

1237
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.470
and we have to try and top the previous fucking four years.
Four years.
All right.

1238
01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:54.310
Go Fuck Yourself.
