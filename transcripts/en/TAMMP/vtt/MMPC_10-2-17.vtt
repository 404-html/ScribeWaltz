00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.700
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:08.560
It's time for the Monday morning podcast farm by day,
October,

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.280
October 2nd oh my God.

4
00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:16.630
Get out your fucking Barracuda Dude.
It's the fucking fall.

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.020
So officially the fall,
isn't it lovely?

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.900
Honda's leaves turning different colors,

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.170
falling off the trees and crunching under your feet.

8
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:29.170
Halloween comes and then Thanksgiving and it'll be good.

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.030
75 80 degrees with whatever,

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.270
but the oceans rising,
but whatever's going very interesting.

11
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.610
It's gonna be very interesting.
False.
I feel coming up.
Oh,
do you feel it,

12
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:44.560
bill?
Was this your own idea?

13
00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:47.830
Did you stick your head out the window and assess it or did you listen to a

14
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.970
bunch of Shit on TV?
I ride.
She got me.
You got me.

15
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:56.020
But it is the fall,
the falls,
one of my favorite seasons,

16
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.160
what I loved about the fall was the beginning of the school year and I

17
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:04.330
absolutely loved school.
I just,
when I was a child,
I just,
I craved knowledge.

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
I don't know what it was like.

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.310
Of course the other kids wanted to go outside and play and gaging contests of

20
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:16.210
sport,
but not me.
No,
I just wanted to curl up in the corner.
Just couldn't just,

21
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.460
the mother just couldn't get me enough books.

22
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.970
I know that was obviously,
um,
it was obviously in a non truth.

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.000
None of that was true.
Uh,

24
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.610
what I liked about the fall was I got new clothes for school,
you know,

25
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.760
which back then was you got your hand me downs from your brother and you got a

26
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.850
new pair of sneakers.
All right.
And uh,

27
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:40.210
they were new until the first time it fucking rained or something happened and

28
00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:42.580
then they would just,
you know,
that was it.

29
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.750
And those were your sneakers for a year.
You're wore sneakers for a year.

30
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.750
Your mother bought him like a half size or a full size too big dependent.

31
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.290
We know.
She was trying to gauge,
you know,

32
00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:56.170
when your balls we're going to drop to considering how big your feet we're going

33
00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:00.610
to be.
Right.
It was one of those,
you know,

34
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.390
one of those things back then it was like nine grades all in one class,

35
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.770
not fuck a book.
Um,

36
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.850
I liked the new sneakers in the new clothes and whatever.

37
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:13.210
You hand me down shit that I got from my older brother.
And then,
uh,

38
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.510
and then it was football and then also it was starting to get cold so I didn't

39
00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:22.240
have to deal with any more.
Dude,
look out why your fucking legs are,

40
00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.770
I didn't have to deal with that with the summer.

41
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:25.750
I didn't have to deal with sunburns.
I liked it.

42
00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:30.670
I was more of a fucking winter guy.
Um,
but other than that,

43
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.510
everything else sucked by fucking arc.
180 days of school to go.

44
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.981
Can you believe that?

45
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:40.981
You used to think that that was hard and he actually used to fuck up in school

46
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.860
if you would like me.
I always look back.
It's just like,

47
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.170
why don't I just come home?
Why don't you just pay attention,

48
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:48.820
come home and just do my homework.

49
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.080
I could've gone to like a really good college like,
and,

50
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.090
and to me a good college is,
it has,
it has a sports program that I can follow.

51
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.900
It's one and you know,

52
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.100
they battled for fucking at least a win their conference.

53
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.130
You know what I mean?
I don't fucking,

54
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.990
I dunno,
I don't fucking like

55
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.690
these college you should go to where everybody is.

56
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.070
I don't know what it is like to take Vanderbilt and the SEC,
by the way.

57
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.160
Who played a hell of a fucking game this weekend,
right?

58
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.380
Scared the shit out of Florida.
Um,

59
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.910
I always thought that,
you know,

60
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.440
I wish I always assumed that that school sucked because their football team was

61
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.870
no good for so long.
Now they're actually halfway decent.

62
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:48.160
But I judge schools by how good their sports program is.

63
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.600
And you know,
there's a lot of people on real sports are one of those shows that,

64
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:52.901
you know,

65
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:55.930
everybody wears suits and for some reason they have a pen but they never really

66
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:58.930
writing,
you know,
those shows that take it really seriously in the like,

67
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:00.340
what does that say?
What are the civil,

68
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.360
the educational system that people judge a school by their sports programs?

69
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:10.810
Well,
no,
this you fucking pencil,
push and nerd.

70
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.030
There would be no campus without sports.
Okay.

71
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.720
How did that fill a stadium?

72
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.780
And that money goes right back into the school,
doesn't it?

73
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:26.200
God knows it's not paying the players.
All right.

74
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.780
And that's why when you go to the University of Michigan,

75
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:32.680
it's its own fucking city.
It's not because of the science department.

76
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.940
Oh,
the engineers that know how to build the buildings.

77
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.760
It's cause the big blue down the fucking street polo and they pulled in a

78
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.860
hundred,
400,
500,
10,000 people a Goddamn game.

79
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.280
That's what pays for it.
You know,
even if it's not all that money,

80
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:56.230
they level of attention.
And that makes people all around the world,
you know?

81
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.280
No.
That song hail to the victors,
valiant,

82
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:03.940
hail to the victors.
Fucking get on a raft,

83
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.200
get over here and go to that school.
Right.
Is that how it goes?

84
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.130
I Dunno.
Um,

85
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.570
I know what the fuck was I talking about?
Why I like the fall?
Yeah.
I just,

86
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:20.510
what fucked did I study?
So fucking stupid.

87
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:25.260
I can't believe.
I can't imagine if I actually understood calculus,
what my fa,

88
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.990
what my world would be like right now

89
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.720
by just took the time to fuck.
I mean,

90
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:33.150
it's not like they just dumped it all on you the first day.

91
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.660
I forget when I stopped paying attention somewhere around seventh grade,

92
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.900
I just was like,
Eh,
I'm just not into this.

93
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.170
MMM.
Oh my God.

94
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:50.970
I could have studied and then I can do one of those extra curricular things and

95
00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:53.690
got like a scholarship,
you know,

96
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.460
participated in a bunch of other shit.
I would have had that all fleshed out.

97
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:00.080
I see you're on the debating team.

98
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:03.950
You're on the swimming team and I'll let shit remember those fucking kids.

99
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.670
The kid next to his locker was like neat,
you know?

100
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.230
And it wasn't all dented and shit.

101
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.240
Fucking always had his homework or like sweaters,
you know,

102
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.390
you'd just be looking at him like kind of fine.
As fucked as this person is,

103
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.930
like my age.
And they have their shit that together.

104
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.800
Oh,
he's in a thousand papers falling out of my fucking,
there just was a mess.

105
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.530
And every year I'd be like,
Hey,
this is year I'm going to study,

106
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.520
I'm going to fuck in my drawn all over my books.

107
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.270
I'm going to pay attention,
I'm going to try to get all A's and B's.
That's all.

108
00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:39.840
That's all I wanted to do and I just,
I couldn't do it.

109
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.720
I put up a good fight through about,
I get to about September 10th

110
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.740
then I get like that first fucking c,
c,
c,

111
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.540
c.
What's that?
What's that a reference to?
Speaking of moving look movie lines.
Si,

112
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.190
SI,
Si.

113
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.420
Was it summer rentals for summer school there it was.

114
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.500
The Guy who's been on TV for 40 years but never does interviews.

115
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:12.200
So people kind of Mark Harmon,
is that his name?
Who was that guy like chainsaws,

116
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:16.110
some shit and of course they made the Latino girl pregnant cause you could still

117
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:19.590
do that back then.
You can't do that now.
You get called out on it.

118
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.810
They would never do that now.
Now they would make the white guy pregnant

119
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.220
to show that they're progressive.
That's how it would work.

120
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.653
You know what I mean?

121
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.590
There's nothing wrong with having a Latina woman be pregnant,

122
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:40.500
but when she's the only Latino in the fucking movie,

123
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.460
that's when it becomes a problem.
Oh.

124
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:47.070
So she's going to summer school and she's knocked up and she's dressed like

125
00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:50.550
fucking zebra man and heavy metal parking lot.

126
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.790
Do you know?
I'd never seen that.

127
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.790
I thought that was an entire fucking movie and ice for years.
I was like,

128
00:07:56.791 --> 00:08:00.150
I got to get around to watch and heavy metal parking lot.
I never fucking saw it.

129
00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:04.230
And finally somebody referenced it again.
Um,
oh,
I know why.

130
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.630
Dean del Ray from the let there be talk all things,
comedy network podcast.

131
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.270
He sent me a link and one of Judas Priest's guitarist,

132
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.680
uh,
who that those cake cake downing and Glen Tipton I think is Glen Tipton.

133
00:08:19.681 --> 00:08:22.320
He bought,
I hope I'm saying his name right.

134
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.710
He bought a fucking Porsche in 1985 or 86 he went to the factory when he was on

135
00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:31.260
tour and that's back when they made them.
Hey,
there was hand built.

136
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.400
None of this robot shit.

137
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.060
None of this outsourcing it to fucking whatever the fuck they do it now.
Um,

138
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.980
they were handbill okay.

139
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:44.580
By the same people that brought your audio tape

140
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.470
in World War One and World War Two.
All right.
It was fucking,

141
00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:52.200
they were hand fucking built.

142
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.930
It's right at the same people brought you October fest and the Holocaust,

143
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.170
you know what I mean?
They,
they,
they're all over the map over there.

144
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.780
That's why Germany is still such a scary country.

145
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:05.220
It's like what's going to happen over here?

146
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.720
Are we all gonna get drink beers and get shit faced or are you guys going to try

147
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.720
to take over the world again?
You know,

148
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.270
that's what's on their weather channel
as a monitor.

149
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.610
All the psychos over there.
What are the,
what is,

150
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.240
what is the general population planning right now or possibly a small group of

151
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:27.240
really motivated people within Deutschland.

152
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.480
So anyways,
I had never seen heavy metal parking lot.

153
00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:38.770
I thought it was a full movie.
So I sit down to watch it right out of the gate.

154
00:09:38.771 --> 00:09:39.251
I love it.

155
00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:43.870
Cause the concerts at the cap center and that's where I used to watch the,
uh,

156
00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:46.060
you know,
whenever the broad used to play,

157
00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:47.430
when they've gone out and play the capitols.

158
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:51.400
And they had rod language looked like my math teacher back in the day.

159
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.790
Man,
my math teacher was a dead fucking ringer.

160
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.380
Flunked his class two fucking years in a row.
It was two summers.

161
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:00.970
I'll never get back.
Actually my senior year,

162
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.160
I didn't fucking go to some schools like,
well,
what's the point?

163
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.150
I can't get into a school that has a good foot,
you know,

164
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.860
football program or basketball program.
They don't have no sports here,

165
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.460
so fuck it.
Uh,
anyways,

166
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.300
what the fuck am I talking about?
Yeah.
So I'm watching this thing.

167
00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:17.440
So they had the cap center,

168
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.500
which I never really saw what it looked like because they never really showed

169
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:22.630
the outside that I can remember there just be the birds that I,

170
00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:27.631
they would cap center Berry Peterson leading the league with 40 some goals,

171
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.130
a great year.
We had,
um,
and we traded in my belief.

172
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.840
Um,
so I got to watch this fucking thing and,
uh,
I've gotta be honest with you.

173
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.530
Like the memories that came flying back,
first of all,

174
00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:45.790
my first concert ever was Judas priest with doc and opening up.

175
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.400
Of course it was dark and they fucking open for everybody.

176
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.560
Day Open for everybody.

177
00:10:50.561 --> 00:10:55.561
And Tesla Open for fucking and Cinderella opened for fucking everybody.

178
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.833
<v 3>MMM.</v>

179
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.840
<v 1>That was my first on the Turbo Lover Tour.
Right.</v>

180
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.520
And I guess I found out all these years later that that Judas priest guide Glen

181
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.353
Tipton or whatever,

182
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.490
but a fucking Porsche that was a turbo and he loved it so much that he's
fucking,

183
00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:14.731
you know,

184
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:19.320
it was inspired to write a song and then a rob Halford took it in whatever

185
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:23.710
direction he wanted to take it in.
You know,
that we remember that song a Hob,

186
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.070
your turbo lava make no sense.
Right?

187
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.770
<v 4>You won't see me</v>

188
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.480
<v 1>then.
Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.310
<v 4>Uh,
Joe feel me.</v>

190
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.940
<v 1>Oh,
like crazy music.
Right.
Um,</v>

191
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.070
I saw them on that tour.
So anyway,

192
00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:48.670
so I watch that heavy metal parking lot and um,

193
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.030
I was fucking great.
That's exactly what I mean.

194
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.980
Whoever fucking film that I know I'm way,
way,
way past the whole.

195
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.350
Everybody knows that by now.
We have a film that thank,

196
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:02.870
thank you so much for filming that
I do.

197
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.960
The first time I ever saw anybody do blow,

198
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.850
I went to an ACDC concert and I remember I pulled up my big stupid red fucking

199
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.690
hair.
Right.
You know,
and I can't grow it long.

200
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:17.200
My hair just grew out so I,
I was like,
I missed it,
man.

201
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:19.360
I should've come up in the 70s I would have been fine.

202
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.990
We've been rocking that Bernie from room to 22 but you know,

203
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.630
everybody kind of had this shit,
you know,

204
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.760
I dunno what the fuck it was in the 80s wasn't short,
but it wasn't long.

205
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.510
It was right before the mullets feathered.
Everything was feathered.

206
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.570
Farrah Fawcett was so hot.
Even the guys tried to have their hair like curse.

207
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:40.420
Right.
That's what was going on.
And me,
I was just like,
you know,

208
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.130
I was a man without a splitter,
without a fucking country.
So I would pull up,

209
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.040
you know,
not a whisker on my face.

210
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:52.930
I have a fucking pull up my stupid fucking looking like I swear to God looking

211
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:56.190
like a giant Opie Taylor and uh,

212
00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.250
and I was totally into the music but I just look like a fucking freak,

213
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.200
you know,
I should have grown my,

214
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:04.510
I go actually I couldn't grow my house assessed should at least go on the

215
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:08.650
Malakai route and just been drunk enough and just got out of the car and

216
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:11.370
screamed Outlander and then everybody will left me on loan.

217
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.380
I remember I pulled up to the ACDC tig and this fucking guy was doing blow and

218
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:21.010
he had a Toyota pickup truck rusted out.

219
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.830
Of course back then everything fucking Rustin,

220
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.840
especially the Toyota hunters hunks of shit.
But the engines would never die.

221
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.030
Right.
You'd be part driving down the street.

222
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:29.950
You could literally see the fucking engine still working.

223
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.580
So it's guy gets out of the car

224
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.820
and I'm like looking at him like I know we like to same kind of music,

225
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:43.660
but we are not the same person.
I remember he was fucking,
yeah,

226
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:46.150
this blond hair look and he cut his own hair.

227
00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:48.670
It was like some like a fucked up page boy haircut

228
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.300
and like a perm all at the same time.

229
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.670
And like he turned around and through the line and then fucking came right up to

230
00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:02.440
my window as I pulled up looking like a fucking,
I don't know,

231
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.200
I felt like I was in one of those zoos where the animals aren't in a cage,

232
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.360
you know,
he just came up and he just was like,
eh.
And I was kind of like,
hey man,

233
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.580
fortunate I was with somebody else.

234
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.800
And I think that we were listening to who made,

235
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:18.940
who would a very respectable volume.
Um,
yeah,
that was the who made,

236
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:22.960
who went in loudness,
opened up a Japanese heavy metal band.

237
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.190
Um,
I dunno what the fuck I'm talking about here.
Let's,
let's,

238
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:31.030
let's get into the podcast.
I'm just sort of meandering here.
Um,

239
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.450
why don't we talk a little bit of NFL football.
We love,

240
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.340
we've got to talk college first.
All right.
So what I watched,
I watched,
uh,

241
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.350
I watched Texas tech against,
um,
Oklahoma state.

242
00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:48.970
What a fucking great game that was.
And what an atmosphere out there in Lubbock,

243
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:53.660
Texas.
I got to go to what Texas Tech Gay man.
So I was actually out there.

244
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.690
I was looking up theaters to see if they had a little s theater I could play

245
00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:00.800
maybe next year or whatever during football season.
You know,

246
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:02.810
anybody can go to Dallas.
Right.

247
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.510
I've already been to Texas A and M and I've been to the Texas longhorns.

248
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.800
The next big program is Texas Tech.
Right.

249
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.440
Of course they'll give you shit at Baylor.
Smu,

250
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:14.600
they never recovered from the fucking death penalty,

251
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.760
but what else they got out there?
I think that's it.
So,
um,

252
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.030
I was rooting for Texas tech cause I know I just,

253
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.430
just cause they were the underdog but was such a fucking great game.

254
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.410
And I was flipping back and forth,
you know,
my adopted college team,

255
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.330
Lsu fucking tigers,
you know,
we lost again,
but you know,

256
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:39.410
we lost it,
the Trojans.
So that's okay.
You know,
that's how I say it to people.

257
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:41.570
You know,
we lost this week to the Trojans.

258
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.320
I thought USC last two.
Uh,
all they did.

259
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:50.321
I was talking about the Troy Trojans from the very formidable sun belt

260
00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:51.494
conference.

261
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.720
I was embarrassed as a new Lsu fan.

262
00:15:56.721 --> 00:16:01.430
I became an Lsu fan about nine years ago and as a,
uh,

263
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.470
adopted team to see all those fucking people leave the fucking stadium emptied

264
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:11.270
out with eight minutes to go.
All right.
Granted they needed three scores,
but,
uh,

265
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.780
I,
I didn't like that at all.
I hate seeing that.

266
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.230
And then I was at that point just ruling that they came back and won just so all

267
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:21.410
those fucking cunts would have to lie on Monday and say that they,

268
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.760
they were part of the 40 people that still stuck around.
But,
um,

269
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:31.480
I'm trying to think what was worse watching Lsu lose to Troy or the Troy Trojans

270
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:36.560
helmets,
you know,
you know,
everything has to look like fucking,

271
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.291
I dunno,
you know,
that,

272
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:43.490
you know that on that Awful Candy and movie theaters that they only sell it at

273
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:46.700
movie theaters,
whatever those fucking things are.
I don't mean gummy bears.

274
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.410
Do you have a good friend of mine that loves gummy bears?
Guy Friend?
It just,

275
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:55.210
I dunno,
it just,
it almost fucks up our friendship,
you know,
like when,

276
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.750
when he's kind of bugging me,
whatever.

277
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:00.080
I just kind of think every once in a while it gets fucking guy likes gummy
bears.

278
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.410
I'll do what?
I love going to movies,
you know,
I fucking love going to movies.

279
00:17:06.411 --> 00:17:09.530
I take my kids,
you know,
get a box of gummy bears,

280
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.050
gummy bears.
Um,
yeah,

281
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:22.230
the fucking Oregon ducks.
All right.
Those greening yellow cons,

282
00:17:22.231 --> 00:17:23.660
they fucked it up for everybody.

283
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.200
They were the first ones to put the disco ball on their head and now everybody's

284
00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:31.370
doing it.
I'm calling it right now.
Those fucking things are going to look,

285
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.610
they're going to look fucking ridiculous in years to come.
People will be like,

286
00:17:34.611 --> 00:17:38.090
what in the Pfizer and electric is that thing like plugged in or some shit?

287
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.500
Some of them are cool.
I guess.
I don't know what,
but I,
I love how the MLB,

288
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:44.120
this year they went back to the,
uh,

289
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.230
like they went to like this non gloss matte color on the batting helmets.

290
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:52.590
They look fucking mean as hell,
man.
I'm mean as hell,
man.

291
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.840
Um,
so anyways,
that's what the fuck I watched and I'm done.

292
00:17:57.841 --> 00:17:59.250
I watch pro football today.

293
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.950
<v 6>Ooh,</v>

294
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.300
<v 1>JJ,
Jj,</v>

295
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.730
the New England patriots with their second loss of the year.
Um,

296
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.840
pardon me and joys that they lost twice because it keeps all the fucking pray.

297
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:16.730
It'd be nice to have a nice fucking anticipation free a season,

298
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.650
you know?
And when you're two and two,

299
00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:23.480
God knows nobody's fucking looking at you now.
Uh,
how about that defense?
Huh?

300
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.230
The fuck
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you right now,

301
00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:30.050
if you want to score 30 points,
you got to go to New England.

302
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.700
I'm trying to,
I should look this up like we gave up,

303
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.710
I think we gave up 75 points in the first two games and then we added another 30

304
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:44.130
today.
Is that what happened?
Let's look at the Patriots here.

305
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.660
Let's look at the sad,

306
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.130
sad tale and I can't figure out what the fuck is going on.

307
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.730
I mean how many yards have we given up this year on,

308
00:18:54.731 --> 00:18:58.930
on just like blown coverages that fucking fake screen pass.

309
00:18:58.931 --> 00:19:02.530
Like the entire defense on that side bites on it.

310
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.700
You know,
if you look around corners and our safety's,

311
00:19:06.701 --> 00:19:08.200
it's still butler Chung McCourty.

312
00:19:08.201 --> 00:19:10.150
Those guys have been playing together for years.

313
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.670
I don't know how long we've had the Gilmore Guy,
but I like that guy.

314
00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:14.560
That guy hits hard,
he knocked somebody out of the game,

315
00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:19.030
he had another good hit you a bullshit hands to the face and then a brutal one.

316
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.880
But a,
we shouldn't have been in that situation to begin with.
But,
um,

317
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.090
our offense is fine me course.

318
00:19:28.091 --> 00:19:31.360
I would love if our offensive line could give him a little Brady a little more

319
00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:36.280
time.
Um,
he's definitely taken too many hits,
but we're still scoring points.

320
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:41.410
But our defense,
Jesus Christ,
not really stopping the run,

321
00:19:41.411 --> 00:19:46.120
not really getting pressure on the quarterback blown fucking coverages.

322
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.050
But,
uh,
I just feel like the blown coverage,
is that something that,
you know,
Matt,

323
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:54.700
Patricia can work on,
right?
He can get those guys like three of the four of them.

324
00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:57.340
It's just like,
you guys want to fucking Superbowl last year.
I'm not,

325
00:19:57.341 --> 00:19:58.300
I don't know all the patriots,

326
00:19:58.301 --> 00:20:01.750
so I don't know when Gail Morgan on the fucking team.
Um.
All right,

327
00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:03.010
let's look at Patriot's here.

328
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.150
patriots.com I should have gone schedule,
right?

329
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:08.710
Is that what I should've done it.

330
00:20:08.711 --> 00:20:12.730
This is going to take for fucking ever patriots schedule.
All right,
here we go.

331
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.140
Patriot schedule.

332
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.090
They're going to go download this schedule when,
okay,

333
00:20:19.091 --> 00:20:23.680
so we let up 42 points the first week.
Then we were on the road,

334
00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.000
only led up 20.

335
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:30.810
Then we let up 33 and we let up 33 again.

336
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.340
Those are all at fucking up.
No,
two of those were home.
Three of those were home.

337
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.410
Jesus fucking Christ.
All right.
33 36 42 I think.
I Dunno,

338
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.250
I just glance at those numbers.
Wait,

339
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.710
(333) 034-0220 thank God for the 20.

340
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.290
All right.
42 and 20 is 62 so that's 31.

341
00:20:56.291 --> 00:21:00.430
So we're averaging like fucking,
I dunno,
30 I guess.

342
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:02.760
32 points a fucking game.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Todd,
right?
No,

343
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:07.300
you're not going to go far in the fucking playoffs.
Um,
by the way,

344
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.430
my fucking football pick came in.

345
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.980
I called it the fucking giants getting three against Tampa Bay.

346
00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.560
Dude,
I fucking called it.
I told you,

347
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:23.450
granted the giants didn't fucking win,
but they only lost by two.
Um,

348
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.520
and as a Patriot Fan,
I hate that the giants are owned fourth,

349
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.620
more so than I hate the fact that we're two and two,

350
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.340
because I wanted to play the giants again.
The Superbowl,
the fucking beat.

351
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:36.070
Those passed.
It's one time when you're [inaudible] we got nothing to lose.

352
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:39.700
The giants got everything to lose.
They got shit talking rights right now.

353
00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:42.910
You just got to say,
hey,
you guys fucking owners,
right?
By the way,

354
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:44.450
somebody tweet you like to do.
And what was the last,

355
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.490
have you guys even fucking beat us?
I went to a home game or an away game.

356
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:50.770
I'm sorry.
Giants.
We fucking beat u of a,
I dunno,

357
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.700
the last time we played you in the regular season in your fucking house,

358
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:59.580
you can't,
it's fucking guys bragging about preseason games.

359
00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:03.060
It's like,
dude,
you won two super bowls.
That's all you give a fuck about.
Um,

360
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.260
so anyways,
uh,
so that's my one picks.

361
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:10.350
So now I'm going to make another pick on Thursday.
All right.
That'd be,

362
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.830
that'd be Thursday.
I'm going to do my NFL pick of the week now.

363
00:22:13.831 --> 00:22:16.260
What's is what you have to thank for your fucking degenerate Gambler,

364
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.540
you know good.
And God damn well,

365
00:22:18.541 --> 00:22:22.290
I have just as much chance with the information that I'm using of picking a

366
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:27.030
winner as a housewife who doesn't watch a game.
Okay.
So this first week,

367
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.250
I'm not going to say it was dumb luck.

368
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.180
I was going on fucking how many points the giant scored against the eagles.

369
00:22:35.311 --> 00:22:37.590
I know the score and I'm late.
And then Eli Manning,

370
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.540
who's ripped my heart out twice,

371
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.930
showed it to me and then very politely aided and did get any blood on his

372
00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:47.820
Docker's right?
I was like,
there's no fucking way that these guys,

373
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.930
and I thought that they want to come away with a wind.
I did Buccaneers.
Look,

374
00:22:51.931 --> 00:22:56.670
Greg,
God bless him by the way.
Who the fuck is this?
Ron Funches guy on the,

375
00:22:56.671 --> 00:22:59.310
on the,
uh,
on,
uh,

376
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.530
Carolina fucking panthers.
Guy was killing us all day long.
I was,

377
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.190
I don't pray for injuries,
but when his leg cramped up,
I was like,
thank God.

378
00:23:08.191 --> 00:23:12.120
Then he came back out again,
caught another first down second.

379
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.420
We get that fucking guy out of here.
Um,

380
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.200
so anyways,
that's what I was basing it on.

381
00:23:19.201 --> 00:23:22.110
So I'm going to pick another one on Thursday and then you the degenerate
gambler.

382
00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:25.590
You gotta be wondering.
We'll all freckles.

383
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.570
Will he get lucky two weeks in a row?

384
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.270
Because now I'm in your head because I won last week.

385
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.770
This is like playing roulette,
like gone,
right?
The last time was black.

386
00:23:34.771 --> 00:23:36.660
Is it going to be another black or is it going to be a red?

387
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.230
Do I sit out this week?
See,
if it goes to blacks and row,

388
00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:44.520
then I know it's going to be red.
All right.
No,
it was red this week.

389
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:49.370
I'm a fucking goddamn ginger.
All right.
But with that guy,
fucking,

390
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:52.490
he didn't pay his taxes.
Always been on black.
Always been on red.

391
00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:01.340
Um,
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that might be the Photoshop of this week.

392
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.260
It's too fucking easy.
Right?
That's a movie poster right there.
Always bet on red.

393
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.150
I don't know who's playing next week.
So how about those fucking La Ramps,

394
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.260
not your same old rams.
Fucking win,

395
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.060
win and win and beat the Dallas fucking cowboys.
Jesus Christ.

396
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:24.300
They're going to have their fucking heads in a new south there.
Um,
all right,

397
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.480
well let's get down to it.
Oh,

398
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:29.780
Billy fucking booze bag is back.

399
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.270
I fell off the wagon.
I couldn't do it.
I'm fucking with you.

400
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:39.290
I'm still on the fucking wagon.
I went to Vegas and I passed that test.

401
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.370
I was at the,
uh,
the Monte Carlo,
not the race.

402
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.880
The fucking casino stayed over at the MGM Grand Cause they're doing some,

403
00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:51.850
uh,
construction,
I guess on the Monte Carlo.

404
00:24:51.851 --> 00:24:55.220
So they had me across the street and uh,

405
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.000
oh my God,
what a fucking,
no way.
There's,

406
00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.100
there's no better people watch it then when you go to Vegas,
Holy Shit.

407
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.530
I went down to the pool.
Yes.
I went down to the poor.

408
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.730
I was working with partner Nick.
He's an Italian guy.
He actually has pigments.

409
00:25:06.731 --> 00:25:08.480
So he wanted to go down the pools,
like had fucking,

410
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:09.800
I'm not going to stay in the room the whole time.

411
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.070
So I go down to the God damn pool dude.
And it was like,
right,
this is,

412
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:16.580
the sun had already started to go down.
It was on the other side of the casino.

413
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:18.350
So there really wasn't any sun on the water.

414
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:22.970
So there was maybe five or six young people there and everybody else was my

415
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:27.830
generation or older and Holy Shit,
I know this is a hacky topic.

416
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.180
I know this is,
but thank God I never got a tattoo.

417
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.430
Thank fucking Christ.

418
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:40.490
If you saw these fucking people and they're my age men,
49 years old,

419
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.660
no shirt on,

420
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:48.260
all these fucking chicks with their ankle sorority tattoos telling kids what to

421
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:52.470
do with tattoos,
you know what I mean?

422
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.140
And then that good debt,

423
00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:00.420
what kills me about the tattoo becoming mainstream was the incredible like lack

424
00:26:01.921 --> 00:26:06.420
of research that most people did.
Their total lack of respect

425
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.980
for the art form

426
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.300
and the complete lack of respect for themselves

427
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.430
to go out and try to actually find somebody good at it.

428
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.743
I gotta tell you,

429
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.080
I must have seen 500 fucking tattoos on about a hundred different people down

430
00:26:28.771 --> 00:26:31.320
there.
At the pool.
Everybody just tatted up.

431
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.690
Shit show man boobs are just pex sagging down.

432
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.090
You know,
women,
you always got to give a pass because they have,

433
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.800
they have to bear children.
All right,

434
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.880
but guys,
man,
there's no fucking reason.
You just keep doing the pushups.

435
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.680
Keep the chest high and tight.
What the fuck are you doing?

436
00:26:54.681 --> 00:26:56.420
Lay off the pizza and the boots.

437
00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.830
She's fucking guys just walking around out there,

438
00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:04.430
saggy chest and the fucking tribal band,
the tramp stamps.

439
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:10.280
It was sorority ankle tattoos.
Just fucking horrific.

440
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.340
I went down there and was just sitting there,

441
00:27:13.341 --> 00:27:16.280
just reminded of my own mortality going like,
Jesus Christ.

442
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.900
I really want to fucking act like I'm above these people,
but like,
you know,

443
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:26.540
smartest fucking thing I that I,
I didn't do was I never got a tattoo.

444
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.550
Jesus fucking Christ.
Thank Christ.
I never did it.
You know,

445
00:27:31.551 --> 00:27:35.540
I like it used to be back in the,
you know,
cause look at me.
I'm not a tattoo guy.

446
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.153
<v 3>All right,</v>

447
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.900
<v 1>tattoo,
they got to go back to bad asses.</v>

448
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.923
You know what I mean?

449
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:50.830
Guys in biker gangs or in prison or like chicks who not a shoot pool and wet

450
00:27:51.581 --> 00:27:52.430
leather pants.

451
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.523
<v 3>Right.</v>

452
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.730
<v 1>Hey Amanda,
my fucking mind.</v>

453
00:27:56.731 --> 00:28:01.731
So we went down there and we just looked at that fucking see a humanity and then

454
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:06.870
this guy just comes out just screaming about how he lost 20 grant and he had a

455
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:11.640
big grin on his face.
He goes,
throw me in the pool.
I can't swim.
Maybe I'll drown.

456
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.280
I just thought it's 20 grand.
I just saw it's 20 grand in there.

457
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.720
And I looked down,
it was like,
that fucking guy doesn't have 20 grand.

458
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.530
There's no fucking way he's got 20 grand.
And who fucker walks ease?

459
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:24.510
He's just acting like he's a big shot,
right?
Maybe dead.
I have no fucking idea.

460
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.810
So,
um,
and we went over,

461
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:32.730
we did the show and after the show we sat out by this giant air conditioning

462
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:36.690
duct behind a wall on a picnic table and smoke cigars.
And it was great.

463
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.900
And I didn't participate at all in the Vegas Shenanigans.

464
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.040
I knew enough when I walked through the lobby and I saw the people,

465
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.080
all the young people.
So this is their time.

466
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:50.310
Don't be the creepy guy hanging around,
ruining it,
get the fuck outta here.

467
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:54.240
So I went back over to the MGM,
walked back and a,

468
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:57.690
I got back probably about 1230 at night and that was that first wave of women

469
00:28:57.691 --> 00:29:01.920
that had had enough,
you know,
two out of three of them are walking barefoot,

470
00:29:01.921 --> 00:29:03.990
carrying their horse shoes,
right?

471
00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:07.740
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and they just had dirty feet just walking

472
00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:11.500
to the f with a giant fucking drink.

473
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:16.180
And uh,
I was glad that I stayed.
I did stay out of that and I didn't booze,

474
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.310
although I did smoke a fucking cigar and a kind of did it on an empty stomach

475
00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.930
and I got a minute,

476
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.500
I was a little fucking nauseous cause was this giant Cuban and the next day we

477
00:29:26.501 --> 00:29:30.700
took the helicopter out and back and on the way back there was like a 17 to 30

478
00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:34.600
knot wind dependent on what altitude we were until we really got down low flying

479
00:29:34.601 --> 00:29:35.320
over the 15.

480
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.110
It got down to like nine knots and we're kind of getting pushed around a little

481
00:29:38.111 --> 00:29:41.800
bit up there.
And there was a couple of times I was like,
oh my God,

482
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.040
feeling a little Nazi stuff here.
You know,

483
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.990
that's not what you want to see from your pilot asking for a puke bag.
I mean,

484
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:52.690
the most comforting thing he could say at that point,
you know,
it's all right.

485
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:54.400
It's all right.
I,
I drank last night,

486
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.750
so,
um,
anyways,
but I gotta tell you man,
flying out there,

487
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.230
taking the helicopter and going over the Moh Javvi desert.

488
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.993
<v 3>MMM.</v>

489
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.780
<v 1>Was it was,
it was fucking incredible.
The desert is so it's like beautiful,</v>

490
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:17.630
terrifying,
boiling,
hot and freezing all at the same time.

491
00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.960
It's just fucking a,
I swear to God,
I don't know why.

492
00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:23.060
You know what's something that people thought we faked the moon landing.

493
00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:25.220
This is probably where they went,
right?
The power just went out to the desert.

494
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.770
You know a lot of mountains though.
I don't think they faked it,
man.

495
00:30:30.771 --> 00:30:34.040
I think they going,
I think they got up there.
I have it gives a fuck.

496
00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:36.720
Maybe they didn't.
There's so much shit for me to fucking babble about.

497
00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:39.550
Did you guys wants to Formula One at all?
Huh?

498
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:43.750
Anybody see it in any way?
She ate it all.
Uh,

499
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:49.740
what do I have it here?
It gets to the fucking standings.

500
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.790
I know.
What's his face?
One from red bull.

501
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.980
Red Bull had to fucking cars and I can now,

502
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:57.610
I always want to say I always fuck up that guy's name.
The fuck is his name.

503
00:30:57.611 --> 00:31:01.540
Who wanted this?
Who won the race today?
The fuck's his name.

504
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.810
What is his name?
Max for staffing.

505
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.930
Once I think Sebastian Vettel.

506
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:15.200
I can't think for staffing cause that v like my brain can only handle one v word

507
00:31:15.751 --> 00:31:19.950
a minute or the same letter.
I'm telling you,
I have this,

508
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.450
I don't know what the fuck my deal is.
Um,

509
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:28.230
but this is the first race that I saw.
We're Lewis Hamilton or,

510
00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:31.920
or uh,
Valtteri Botox in the Mercedes teams.

511
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.200
One of either one of them.
If they,

512
00:31:34.201 --> 00:31:36.270
if they're in first fucking place going into the turn,

513
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:39.690
the Mercedes cars are just too goddamn good.
Maybe a Ferrari can run him down.

514
00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:43.620
I've never fucking seen it,
but red bull,
this was their day.

515
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.560
This was their track.
They were amazing.

516
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.820
Lewis Hamilton got into fucking the first,

517
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.130
it was the first person that came out in the lead.

518
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.640
I can't even talk this fucker podcasts.
I apologize.
Um,

519
00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:03.350
came on to the first turn in the lead and as far as my year and a half of

520
00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:05.510
watching the shit,
that means you're going to win the race,

521
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:10.850
especially if you're in a Mercedes and um,
for staff.

522
00:32:10.851 --> 00:32:15.170
And actually came right up on him and went right around them like it was
nothing.

523
00:32:15.171 --> 00:32:18.560
And then opened up like an eight,
nine second lead on them.
I have,

524
00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:23.570
I've never seen that.
I'm a Mercedes,
humbled like that by red bull.

525
00:32:23.571 --> 00:32:28.180
So congratulations.
Then Daniel Ricardo came in third place and,
uh,

526
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.090
Lewis Hamilton,
fucking steady,
steady Eddie there,

527
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.760
still got second place.
He's got 281 fucking point.

528
00:32:35.761 --> 00:32:38.120
Sebastian Vettel for whatever fucking reason.
Ferrari.

529
00:32:38.121 --> 00:32:41.810
I don't know what they're doing.
My daughter had her first cold man,

530
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:44.090
so I was kind of watching her.
So I missed the beginning.

531
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:47.690
All the sudden Kimmy raking it in at some going on with his turbo and he didn't

532
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:51.440
even fucking drive and Sebastian Vettel was way in the back,

533
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:53.360
so I'm going to guess,
uh,

534
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.590
either fucked up during the time trials and it got some sort of penalty or they

535
00:32:57.591 --> 00:32:58.970
had to switch out a gearbox.

536
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.950
There's some shit that puts you at the back of the race.

537
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:05.000
You're only allowed to use so many parts,
so many engines or something like that,

538
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.000
um,
throughout the season.
So he was all the way in the back.

539
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:12.060
He was able to work himself all the way up to fourth place.
Um,

540
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.590
which was really impressive.
Uh,
but now he is,
be as,

541
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.600
what does he got?
He's 34 fucking points.
I mean,

542
00:33:21.601 --> 00:33:24.960
I don't think that they'd make it up after that debacle in Singapore,

543
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.590
that absolute fucking three stooges fucking debacle.

544
00:33:28.591 --> 00:33:29.640
I don't think that they make it up,

545
00:33:29.641 --> 00:33:33.930
but it was very exciting as a new fan of Formula One to actually see somebody

546
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.590
enforced first place and get passed to actually see a Mercedes Benz in first

547
00:33:37.591 --> 00:33:39.960
place and get past it gave me hope.

548
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:44.140
That Formula One can be more like that.
Um,

549
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.860
the way moto GP is.
All right.
Um,
anyway,

550
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.180
so let's get to some of the reeds here for the week.
Uh,
some of the,

551
00:33:51.181 --> 00:33:56.010
actually some of the advertising here,
shall we,
uh,
have a popup?
Where is it?

552
00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:01.040
Ah,
look who's here?
Pro Flowers.
Oh No,
wait,

553
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.970
wait,
wait,
wait.
Did I cut that off?

554
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:10.310
This podcast?
It just fucking blows.
What am I doing today?
Oh,
look,
goes here.
Me.

555
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.040
Andy died.
Oh,
doto be Andy's beyond ease.
Bill can't fucking read to do,

556
00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:18.880
to do Mondays.
BMDS mass is starting to bleed,

557
00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:24.120
but thank God I got fucking silk down by my tank and my balls.

558
00:34:24.911 --> 00:34:28.450
Who fucking cares if I'm bleeding from the cheeses pill?
That's not,

559
00:34:28.451 --> 00:34:30.100
that's just disgusting.
You already know me.

560
00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:32.500
Undies makes the most comfortable underwear in the world.

561
00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.290
It fun to wear isn't your thing,
man.

562
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:39.190
We're excited to announce that me undies socks are finally here.

563
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.600
Be ready for work,
play and everything in between with the new me undies.
Socks.

564
00:34:43.601 --> 00:34:45.340
If you thought your balls felt good,

565

Basket squash got me there.
All right.

633
00:39:00.801 --> 00:39:04.510
Dollars Dollar Shave Club.
You Dude.
Uh,

634
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.180
what you might not know is that dollar shave club also has products for pretty

635
00:39:08.181 --> 00:39:12.530
much everything else you need in the bathroom.

Hair Gel,
lip balm,
herpes medicine,

637
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.050
everything at the store,
that crab comb at the store.

638
00:39:21.051 --> 00:39:24.350
There are too many options and you can't tell the difference between any of
them.

639
00:39:24.351 --> 00:39:29.000
If it's a brush or things for my taint,
why is it always go to the taint?

640
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.520
I Dunno.
Uh,
then if you have any questions,

641
00:39:31.521 --> 00:39:36.521
the clerk usually doesn't know the difference either or can't really help you

642
00:39:36.861 --> 00:39:41.861
sense they are not an expert on the products or maybe they just have one person

643
00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:45.860
working there.
Like my experience in fucking cvs and Dwayne Reed,

644
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.520
they run a skeleton shift in the middle of the fucking day.

There's something else.

649
00:40:01.041 --> 00:40:04.760
This is like the family feud named something you'd find in a bathroom.

650
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.450
Johnson family,
uh,
pube tremors,

651
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.220
show me puke trainers.
Now we'd be like the fourth answer.

652
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.220
Everybody claps,
you know,

653
00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:21.170
and as they go like the authority and the intelligence slowly starts to drop.

654
00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.260
You know,

655
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.580
maybe if they have an artist in the family that last family members are right,

656
00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:29.270
but when they get down to that last person,
who else do we fucking break?

657

You know?
Um,

Can I give you guys advice on a safety razor?
When you have a weighted handle?

675
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:41.480

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.600
Is that it?
Is that it for the reading?
Um,

713
00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.850
what else did I want to talk about that I handle everything I think I did.

714
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:04.340
By the way,
I'm going to be in a Saint Petersburg,

715
00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:09.020
Florida at the Mahaffey theater.
They added a late show this Friday night.

716
00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.200
It's going to be me,
uh,

717
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.910
Rosebowl Tailgate Legend,
Aka the,

718
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:21.320
uh,
the crown royal kid,
Joe Barton.
Nick.
That's his new nickname,

719
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.990
the crown royal kid.
He just got signed to a three year deal.
Um,

720
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.800
Paul [inaudible],
Paul Dude,
I called it Versie.
Whatever you do,

721
00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:34.830
do not bring up that as giants are o and four.
Okay.
He's very sensitive.

722
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.880
We're going to be down there.
Uh,

723
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.470
and Thursday night I'm going to the Patriots for Tampa game.

724
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:41.700
I'm going to be respectful.

725
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:44.220
I'm not wearing my patriots gear because I don't wanna listen to everybody

726
00:44:44.221 --> 00:44:47.610
giving me shit.
I don't need all that shit.
Even if we were undefeated,

727
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:50.490
I still wouldn't wear it.
I,
I've learned,
I just,
I just go there.

728
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.510
I silently route from my fucking team of Tampa wins.
I say congratulations.

729
00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:55.344
Who gives a fuck?

730
00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.390
This is the last NFL team that I need to see a home game of.

731
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.090
And then I'll have gone to all the baseball and all the,

732
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.320
all the football at a professional level.
And uh,

733
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.320
in my world of doing horrible in school and going to colleges,
uh,

734
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:13.550
numerous colleges during my college career,
none of which,
oh,

735
00:45:13.551 --> 00:45:18.120
I went to NC state for my first,
my freshman year.
Um,

736
00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.790
sort of what's in the off campus program.

737
00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:25.080
I literally fucking drove into the library and watch the classes on cassette

738
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:27.870
tape.
Like I had some sort of fucking terminal disease.

739
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.260
That was my first semester and second semester I had two classes,

740
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.550
both of which I flunked because by then I decided I didn't want to be in North

741
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.190
Carolina.
So I sorta went there.
Um,

742
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.470
this is back when NC state wolf pack had like a Chucky Brown and Charles,

743
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:44.940
I think it was Charles Shackleford,

744
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.030
I believe they still had grass seats in the end zone.

745
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:52.050
I went to a Carolina a state game there.

746
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.500
Then I went to a couple other schools,
uh,
ended up in Emerson.

747
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:01.110
Emerson,
I don't even know what to fucking mascot is.

748
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.230
I have no idea what it is a,
anyways,

749
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.460
it's like a final draft software with some shit.

750
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.980
The fuck am I talking about?
Yeah.

751
00:46:12.981 --> 00:46:16.200
So I'm going to be in a Saint Petersburg and then I'm going to own,
on Saturday,

752
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:19.800
we're going to the Florida gators for us.

753
00:46:19.801 --> 00:46:21.930
Lsu Mighty Lsu.

754
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.250
So I will be silent.
He rooting for,
I liked Florida too,

755
00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:27.600
but I'll be rooting for Lsu.
Man.

756
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:32.601
I can't fucking just cause they lost to the sunbelt Trojans the fuck.

757
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.080
Uh,
but I get to go to the legendary swamp and a,

758
00:46:37.081 --> 00:46:38.910
I actually love both those teams,
but a,

759
00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.920
I decided to hitch my wagon to Lsu so I can't just like fucking jump.
I will,
I,

760
00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:45.870
you know,
I'm not going to be a cunt on either one of those.

761
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:49.590
I'm just going to be happy to be at that legendary field.
Um,

762
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.950
the at the swamp and then also to be at the,
uh,

763
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.380
pirates of the Caribbean stadium stadium at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers planned.

764
00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.440
Um,
all right.
Lewis Hamilton on HBO.
Hey Bill.
Big Fan.

765
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.850
Just wanted to let you know that Lewis Hamilton is going to be featured on Hbo

766
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.450
Real Sports Tonight.
I got to watch that.
Uh,
if you miss it,
I'm sure you,
you can,

767
00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:14.970
uh,
I'm sure you can watch it later on.
Demand.
Keep doing your thing.

768
00:47:14.971 --> 00:47:17.970
Love F is for family and the podcast is a weekly ritual for me.

769
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:21.420
Best wishes to you and your growing family.
Oh,
thank you very much.

770
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:23.490
I'm going to try to check that out.
I saw,

771
00:47:23.491 --> 00:47:27.210
I follow Louis Hamilton on Twitter and I saw that he,
uh,

772
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.520
he had some announcement to make and it looked like he was wearing some moto GP

773
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:34.480
suit and he was walking to a,
towards a motorcycle.

774
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:38.530
Now there's no fucking way the Mercedes team is going to let them do that,
right?

775
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.100
I don't think so.
So I don't know what the announcement was made.

776
00:47:43.101 --> 00:47:46.690
We'd said he got another diamond stud for his other side.
It was,
knows,

777
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:50.710
I have no idea.
I don't pretend to live in that man.
Stratosphere.

778
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.420
I live in the troposphere.
He lives in the stratosphere.
Alright.

779
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.980
The Buccaneers logo,
everybody.
A bullet bill.

780
00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:04.000
Uh,
the original Buccaneers logo was taking from the school.

781
00:48:04.001 --> 00:48:07.120
I went to Beloit college.

782
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:12.150
They settled in court and Beloit one because the school has been around before

783
00:48:12.671 --> 00:48:14.410
the NFL.
Uh,

784
00:48:14.411 --> 00:48:19.411
the school is big in the liberal arts culture and the conversation of changing

785
00:48:19.451 --> 00:48:24.020
the mascot due to the barbaric history of the Buccaneers,
uh,

786
00:48:24.021 --> 00:48:27.850
the school actually has two mascots and official and unofficial.

787
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:33.270
Unofficial is a turtle and they're trying to see if they can make it the

788
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:38.140
official mascot over the buccaneer.
Good Lord.
I could,

789
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.760
I could give a fuck about it.

790
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:44.770
But how would you feel if the Patriots were to change to a pussy animal?

791
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.160
First of all,
I fucking love turtles.
If you don't like turtles,
man,
this,

792
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.600
there's something wrong with you.
They're awesome.
They don't bug anybody.

793
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:56.450
And if you think they're pussies,
go out and go get bit by one.
Um,

794
00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.870
I fucking love turtles.

795
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.740
I add one is a pet and I went to church and I came home and it drowned.

796
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.570
Name was Ralph and I buried it in the fucking woods.
I never got another one.

797
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.570
Uh,
thanks for bringing it up a bit.
Anyways,

798
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.580
some pussy animal because they're associated with white nationalists or
whatever.

799
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:20.290
Grotesques historical events that is beyond our control.
Um,

800
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.710
the funny thing about that is all the liberal white people that go along with

801
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:27.910
doing that shit do not want to give up their land or their flat screen TVs.

802
00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.540
I get,
you know,
so as a,
as a a halfassed,

803
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:35.860
you know,
gesture,
they're going to get rid of the mascot.

804
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:39.250
Like obviously I feel the Redskins.
I mean it's literally like a racial slur,

805
00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:44.080
so I get that one.
But,
uh,
this other shit,
I mean,
I dunno,

806
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.520
liberal people want to get rid of it,
but I feel that's kind of a way of,
uh,

807
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.810
getting away with being [inaudible] as you're kind of getting rid of the

808
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:57.190
evidence.
You know,
if they had the buccaneer on the side,
they'd be like,
well,

809
00:49:57.191 --> 00:49:58.840
who's that?
And be like,
Oh yeah,

810
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.110
that was a group of white people that came over here and just massacred a bunch

811
00:50:02.111 --> 00:50:04.600
of fucking people.
Just took a bunch of shit.
They were evil.

812
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.470
They were evil in for all I know.
Uh,
you are one of their descendants,

813
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.510
but if you just make it all go away and it's just a turtle.
I Dunno.

814
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.640
I think they give human beings too much credit.

815
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.690
Like you have to understand that we're kind of out of our fucking minds.
Um,

816
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:24.490
some something,
some of it has to do with power.
I don't know what it is,
but,

817
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:28.700
uh,
I dunno.
We get too
much power.
You,

818
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:31.920
we behave like those fucking chimpanzees when they go out and hunt the other

819
00:50:31.921 --> 00:50:36.490
monkeys.
You know what I mean?
I'll never fucking get over watching that.
I just,

820
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.350
it's the human,

821
00:50:37.351 --> 00:50:40.440
the way they get excited and the way they torture the other fucking monkey

822
00:50:40.441 --> 00:50:43.680
rather than just kill the fucking thing is a,

823
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.660
is a level of like sit down.
That's why I don't like cats.

824
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:52.590
I don't like how they just won't kill the mouse.
How the fucking things freaking,

825
00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:54.630
I just put it out of its fucking misery.
They want,

826
00:50:54.631 --> 00:50:55.650
still want to have fun with it.

827
00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.353
<v 3>MMM.</v>

828
00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.120
<v 1>Like if somebody said we're descendants of cats,
I'd be like,
yeah,</v>

829
00:51:01.121 --> 00:51:04.060
I fucking believe that.
Where are we sneaking up on each other?

830
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:08.620
Trying to stab one another,
you know?
Um,
anyways,

831
00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:13.800
I respect cat,
so,
you know,
I respect them all.
I'm just saying,
you know,

832
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.260
step behaviors is fucking weird.
Anyways,
he says,

833
00:51:18.261 --> 00:51:21.890
love the fuck out of the podcast and listening since 2011 and followed your

834
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:25.100
comedy since.
Why do I do this?
Uh,
thank you for all the labs.

835
00:51:25.101 --> 00:51:27.050
Hope your family's doing well and go fuck yourself.
Yeah,

836
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:31.460
my baby girl had a little bit of the sniffles do an a baby as a cold and it's

837
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:35.450
sneezes.
It's the funniest shit ever.
They don't cover their mouth and just,

838
00:51:35.451 --> 00:51:40.280
it's fucking unreal.
It's like poltergeist and uh,
what's that?
What's that?

839
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:44.720
Nickelodeon slimed.
Um,
so if you've got a baby,

840
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:48.470
uh,
somebody told me this is good advice was just to get like a,

841
00:51:48.471 --> 00:51:50.820
a face cloth and have it wet.
Just,
you know,

842
00:51:50.821 --> 00:51:53.720
dab at it so you don't make their nose all raw and all that stuff.

843
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.980
Obviously frequently rinse it out,
change it.
I know this is disgusting,

844
00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:00.920
but it was kind of what I was doing.
Um,

845
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:04.490
I feel like I gave her the cold cause I came back from Toronto and I felt like I

846
00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:09.491
had was fighting off something and I'm not going to not hug and kiss my daughter

847
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.010
is that my daughter.
Right.

848
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.490
So I was hanging out with her and uh,

849
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:19.910
Neil was out with some friends this weekend,
so it was kind of a,

850
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.210
I get to be the single dad and I got to tell you,
man,
I fucking loved it,

851
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:27.590
you know,
I dunno what these single parents are complaining about.

852
00:52:27.591 --> 00:52:30.770
I did it for about eight hours and I didn't have a problem at all.

853
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.030
No,
it was awesome.
She watched them,

854
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.000
the Formula One race with me and she watched the Patriots game.

855
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:40.970
I got a patriots one Z.
Um,

856
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.330
I think it said little but awesome or something like that.

857
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:46.280
Has the Patriot logo on it and whenever it's football Sunday.

858
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:49.400
And what's cool is Nia is not into sports and shit.

859
00:52:49.401 --> 00:52:51.200
So she didn't want her to have a bunch of sports shit,

860
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:54.440
but I just bought it anyways.
And uh,

861
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:59.120
she fought for like two seconds.
He's like,
all right,
if you're into that,
fine,

862
00:52:59.121 --> 00:53:03.770
she gets it,
she gets it.
So that's what it is.
Football Sunday,
I come home,

863
00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.830
she's got two different patriots onesies.

864
00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.800
I got to get her a Bruins one for the season coming up and all it's playoff

865
00:53:09.801 --> 00:53:14.360
baseball.
Joe Bucket,
his finest,
um,

866
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.660
efforts for families.
Joe Buck add his finest.

867
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:21.050
I'm looking forward to that.

868
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.420
Crossing my fingers for a Yankees.

869
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.440
Red Sox match up another classic series.
Who knows who wins this,
you know,

870
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:29.850
I don't know how many times we played this year,

871
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:34.200
but we were dead even if we played 18 times.
We went nine and nine

872
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:37.930
and I got it to be interesting,

873
00:53:37.931 --> 00:53:42.250
serious cause I haven't seen price be able to beat the fucking Yankees at least

874
00:53:42.251 --> 00:53:45.900
in the second half when I was paying attention.
So we'll see.
Uh,

875
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.740
how many home runs did judge end up with?

876
00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.690
I love all the people that have given him shit.

877
00:53:49.691 --> 00:53:54.520
I was so happy that he got fucking 50.
These fucking cops,
dude.
I'm telling you.

878
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:57.340
Did they say that the home run Derby fucks up your swing?

879
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:01.120
I was that what they say?
So what they say?
You know,
you're not a football scout,

880
00:54:01.121 --> 00:54:05.800
are you all right Aaron,
judge.
All fucking rise court is in session.

881
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:10.240
Have you reached a verdict?
We get it.
His last name's judge Aaron.

882
00:54:10.241 --> 00:54:14.830
Judge stats.
Here we go.
I know we've got 50.

883
00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.180
What did he finish with?

884
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.190
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

885
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:22.890
<v 1>Oh,
runs 50 fucking toe.
Holy Shit.</v>

886
00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.580
That is fucking amazing.
52 home runs.

887
00:54:27.581 --> 00:54:31.150
I don't know everybody give him shit about a strikeout.
Gives a fuck.

888
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:32.350
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

889
00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:36.050
<v 1>114 rbis.
Hundred 27 base on balls.</v>

890
00:54:36.051 --> 00:54:39.770
208 strikeouts.
52 home runs.

891
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.360
You had 542 at bats
and he had to,

892
00:54:44.361 --> 00:54:48.800
he still hit two 84 with two oh 208 strikeouts.
He's still at two 84.

893
00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.430
It's fucking amazing.
What a season graduations to him.
I hope he beat you.

894
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.880
I hope he be,
if we fucking,
you know,
and I'm gonna,
you know,

895
00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.090
I'm not one of those cats that can't recognize greatness.
That's fucking amazing.

896
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.860
All right,
dear Billy button nose.
Uh,

897
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:09.580
thought this was interesting and new French law says that photo's must come with

898
00:55:09.581 --> 00:55:13.100
a disclaimer
that they're photo shopped.

899
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.170
I love the French.
I fucking love the French.
You know what I mean?
You know why?

900
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.980
Cause they fucking go on around having threesomes and they're sick of being

901
00:55:21.981 --> 00:55:25.700
excited about bringing somebody else into their relationship and they don't look

902
00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:29.240
like the fucking picture.
You know what I mean?
I get it.
Anyways.

903
00:55:29.241 --> 00:55:34.241
It's being done to discourage unhealthy extreme thinness among people trying to

904
00:55:34.341 --> 00:55:39.341
emulate unrealistic body shapes that were faked with the computer program.

905
00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.050
All right,
so it was a little off the mark on that.
Um,

906
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.280
this could really change the landscape from models,
right?

907
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:51.230
There's a sports equivalent in there somewhere.
Uh,

908
00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:55.740
love you love Nia,
keep up the good work.
Um,
yeah,

909
00:55:55.741 --> 00:56:00.690
I mean I think that's probably,
that's not for adults.
That's for more.
Uh,

910
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:05.890
I think that's for kids.
Cause I noticed,
you know,

911
00:56:05.891 --> 00:56:08.210
when I went to Toronto I couldn't believe how good looking the people were.

912
00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:11.710
And I've just been going around in general just noticing how good looking people

913
00:56:11.711 --> 00:56:15.760
are.
And I was just like,
what the fuck is going on?
And what I,
I think it is,
it's,

914
00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:19.180
I think it's an a result of everybody being on social media and you post a

915
00:56:19.181 --> 00:56:21.580
picture yourself in,
you know,

916
00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:25.030
all this stuff that you didn't about yourself and then shit that you didn't even

917
00:56:25.031 --> 00:56:29.980
recognize that,
that evidently people,
other people notice in comments.

918
00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:31.270
<v 0>Okay.</v>

919
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:35.110
<v 1>You know,
hey dude,
you fucking nice new profile picture.
But I got us,</v>

920
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:39.530
I got to ask what's up with your right ear?

921
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:43.190
What's up with that shirt?
What's up at the blah,
blah,
blah,
you know,

922
00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:47.780
and then it's unreal.
And then you start getting like a fucking complex.

923
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.670
Um,
social media is

924
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.930
<v 0>okay</v>

925
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:55.140
<v 1>other than promoting.
Um,
but anyways,</v>

926
00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:57.720
I just feel like for me,
social media,

927
00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:01.530
I promote gigs and I go on and I try to make people laugh.
That's it.

928
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.070
But to actually go on there and look at comments,
it's just not a healthy thing.

929
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.270
I don't think it's healthy for anybody.

930
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:10.710
Even if you're the most beautiful fucking person in the world because you know,

931
00:57:10.711 --> 00:57:13.950
at some point you're going to start to go down the other side and then the

932
00:57:13.951 --> 00:57:16.830
comments,
hey,
you're still hot.

933
00:57:16.831 --> 00:57:20.910
But you starting to look starting to show your age there.
Lol.
Just kidding.

934
00:57:20.911 --> 00:57:23.520
You know,
I love you.
That's all.
Somebody who's got nothing,

935
00:57:23.521 --> 00:57:25.530
nothing but fucking complements,
needs to hear,

936
00:57:25.531 --> 00:57:29.610
and then it's just a downward spiral into fucking botox and all of that shit.

937
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:30.933
Um,

938
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.140
<v 0>yeah.</v>

939
00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:36.070
<v 1>If I could promote anything,
uh,
just fucking,</v>

940
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:40.930
just active goddamn age,
that's the best way to do it.
Just as,

941
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:44.320
as you're in your forties,
dress like you're in your forties,

942
00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.780
keep yourself in good fucking shape.

943
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:51.190
This is certain number you hit and the best she can be at that point is you look

944
00:57:51.191 --> 00:57:55.090
good for your age.
And if somebody says that to you,
it's a fucking compliment.

945
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.150
You got to be young.
You weren't cheated.
All right?

946
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:02.890
Stop trying to fucking hang on by your fingernails.

947
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:07.330
It's fucking over.
Let young people be young.

948
00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.400
Let them have this,

949
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:11.920
whatever the fuck it is they're doing with those God damn Djs.
I don't get it,

950
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.510
but it's their shit.

951
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:18.600
Let him have it stopped showing up with your botox face asking if anybody has

952
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:24.470
any Molly.
Okay,
you're creeping people out.
All right.

953
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:30.030
It's over.
Mike.
My public service announcement is over.
All right.
Apocalypse prep.

954
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:31.531
Hey,
Bill.
Recently,

955
00:58:31.531 --> 00:58:35.340
my girlfriend got mad that I don't have anything prepared in case of a hurricane

956
00:58:35.341 --> 00:58:39.270
or a massive flood.
I'm not naive,
but we live in Kansas City.

957
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.860
I told her that while I have a flashlight,
extra cases of water and a generator,

958
00:58:43.861 --> 00:58:46.680
not bad for a 25 year old homeowner,
that's pretty fucking great.

959
00:58:46.681 --> 00:58:49.930
And you own a home at 25.
Congratulations.
Um,

960
00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:53.580
I don't have a box titled Apocalypse Shit.

961
00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.760
She said,
I never think about the future.
Oh boy.
I told,

962
00:58:59.761 --> 00:59:02.760
you know.
Well,
you know,
at least she's not asking for a kid we made,

963
00:59:02.761 --> 00:59:04.710
I don't think about the future.
I bought a house.

964
00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:06.030
<v 0>Okay.</v>

965
00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.100
<v 1>You're dizzy.
Broad.
Uh,</v>

966
00:59:08.101 --> 00:59:12.720
I told her that a gas power generator is literally a symbol for the future.

967
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.690
Uh,
you talk about this stuff all the time,

968
00:59:15.691 --> 00:59:18.360
but if you actually got anything ready,
thanks.
Ps.

969
00:59:18.361 --> 00:59:22.060
Love the music and the throwbacks.
Uh,
well,
Andrew Feminist,

970
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:26.810
he's the one that picks out the music.
Um,
I,
I bought some shit.

971
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:31.840
I bought some bucket of fucking food that you know would last forever and like

972
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.850
the lid on the bucket,
um,

973
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.030
also doubled as a toilet seat and you could shit in the bucket.

974
00:59:38.031 --> 00:59:42.410
But then I don't know where your food went.
I went down the rabbit hole,
you know,

975
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:46.280
about 10 years ago,
thinking about,
you know,
uh,

976
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:51.080
going off the grid and fucking buying gold and silver coins and all of this
shit.

977
00:59:51.081 --> 00:59:54.290
And then I was just,
then I just went the other way and I was just like,
you know,

978
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:56.300
I don't think I want to survive the apocalypse.

979
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.020
I'm fine if I'm laying in the street,
you know what I mean?

980
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:05.010
Cause then I would just live this unbelievable quality life.

981
01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:08.640
And then once the apocalypse hit and everything sucked,

982
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.400
I wouldn't have to fucking live through it.
You know,
you're like,

983
01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:13.080
when I'll fucking player.

984
01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:14.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

985
01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.420
<v 1>Like a</v>

986
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:16.310
<v 0>okay.</v>

987
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:18.230
<v 1>Say Like Doc rivers,
like,
you know,</v>

988
01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:22.430
he won a championship with the Celtics and then they totally dismantled the
team.

989
01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:25.460
He's like,
dude,
I,
I'm too fucking old to go through a rebuilding year.

990
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:28.760
That's how I feel with like society.
Okay.
It's just been great.

991
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.930
Every fucking day of my life.
Okay.
Yeah.
Just,
you know.

992
01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:34.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

993
01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.540
<v 1>My fucking dresser drawer is full of championship rings.</v>

994
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.260
I got to live in this country looking at how I looked.
I fucking lucked out.

995
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

996
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.530
<v 1>I'm not going to fucking lie to you.
I lucked out.
So follow that shit goes away.</v>

997
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.090
You know what I mean?

998
01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:51.510
And everything just collapses and then fucking prisoners a car.

999
01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.370
I'm not going to fucking survive that.
So that'll be yet.
You know what I mean?

1000
01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.360
I'd fucking down a bottle of booze and then just turn the style.

1001
01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.370
I guess it's different now that I've got a family.
I Dunno.

1002
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.760
Maybe I'll buy a generator.
All right.
Movie Lines.

1003
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.590
Movie Lines.
I gave you one this week.
See She,
she uh,

1004
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.670
day Billy Bass drum.
Uh,

1005
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.060
this is the best line from a sub.
Can we,

1006
01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:22.890
can we talk bass drums here for a second?

1007
01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:28.490
Everybody I know has a different fucking way of tuning the Goddamn Bass Drum.

1008
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:30.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1009
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
<v 1>What is your,
what is the way that you do it?
Do you get a good sound out of it?</v>

1010
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:38.750
I just had somebody blew my fucking mind when I thought it was you just tuned

1011
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:40.770
the batter head.

1012
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:41.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1013
01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:45.070
<v 1>You know,
that was the one that I thought you put a little tension too.</v>

1014
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:50.200
And then I thought the other side,
you just fucking,
you know,
just

1015
01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:51.310
<v 0>okay.</v>

1016
01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:55.440
<v 1>You know,
tightened it past the wrinkle.
Alright.
Cause Hey,
you wanted to,</v>

1017
01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.740
you want to move that air,
right?
You also want to have,
I dunno,

1018
01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:02.790
fuck the fucking beat or have something to rebound off of.
And uh,

1019
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.860
then I met somebody and he fucking tells me the exact opposite thing.

1020
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.200
And then I met somebody this weekend and he goes back the other way.

1021
01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:12.370
I don't know what the fuck to do.
All I know is my bass drum tuning sucks.

1022
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:17.140
So,
um,
whatever,
I'm going to give it another shot.

1023
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:20.550
I'm just gonna you just have to have the balls to just,

1024
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.950
just keep on doing it and doing it back again.

1025
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.130
And then just dealing with whatever shit sound you come up with and each time

1026
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:29.490
hopefully getting it a little bit better.
But,
um,

1027
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.560
I'm always open to listen to people.

1028
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.593
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1029
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:37.250
<v 1>any ideas you have,
please let me know.
All right,
dear Billy Bass drum,</v>

1030
01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.960
this is the best line from a supporting character in a movie is from Wayne's

1031
01:02:41.961 --> 01:02:45.260
world too.
There's nothing vulgar so you can play it on air.

1032
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.360
Wayne and Garth had brought a roadie back from the UK to help put a concert put

1033
01:02:50.361 --> 01:02:55.100
on a concert while hanging out.
He tells them this crazy story,

1034
01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.570
rock and roll story about Ozzy,
Jeff Beck and Keith Richards.
Give it a listen.

1035
01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:00.650
All right,

1036
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:04.340
let's hope there's no fucking racial slurs in this like there was last week.

1037
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:06.740
Um,

1038
01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:08.640
<v 2>okay.</v>

1039
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.380
<v 1>Or some reason the link isn't working.</v>

1040
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1041
01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:16.630
<v 1>Oh,
why I want the link work.
Where is it?
Oh,</v>

1042
01:03:16.631 --> 01:03:18.310
you know what,
I,
I have to go over here.
Hang on,

1043
01:03:18.311 --> 01:03:22.180
I'll hit pause so you don't have to torture your way through this.
All right,

1044
01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:25.690
we're back.
Here we go.
Here it is air.
It is.
Come on

1045
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:29.220
<v 7>at three o'clock in the morning.</v>

1046
01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:34.350
Look you for 1000 Brown m and m's to fill up the glass so you wouldn't go on

1047
01:03:34.931 --> 01:03:35.764
stage.

1048
01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.700
<v 1>No one's going to be able to hear this dude.
Yeah,</v>

1049
01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:41.080
I don't know why it's super fucking quiet.
What's going on here?

1050
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1051
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:47.470
<v 1>I got all the volumes up.
Oh,
I know this thing.
And that's when he,</v>

1052
01:03:47.471 --> 01:03:50.380
in the end he said,
uh,
you know,
he goes into the store to go buy him.

1053
01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:54.940
He would need to buy chocolate m and m's to fill up into Ozzie's brandy glass.

1054
01:03:54.941 --> 01:03:59.020
And he goes there and,
and the,
the place was closed and they had some dog.

1055
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.050
You fights off the dog and then he had the murder,

1056
01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.460
the owners with their own shoes.
Right.
I think that's what it is.
I'm sorry dude.

1057
01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.340
I don't know if anybody can hear this.
Can you heron

1058
01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:14.740
<v 7>sweet the ship on the edge of town we got,</v>

1059
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.500
and it's just me and Keith and David Crosby branch it into this local sweet

1060
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.280
shop.
Well,
instead of a gun,

1061
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:30.690
they've got this bloody great big thing.
Well,

1062
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.880
I'll manage to take care of the choice to go with a channel,
but the shop phone,

1063
01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:40.600
her and his son,
that's a different story altogether.
All right.

1064
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:43.090
To beat them to death with the one shoe.

1065
01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.710
<v 1>There you go.
Nasty business,
isn't it?
I never watched it.</v>

1066
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.760
I know I never saw Wayne's world.
That was great when I started doing standup,

1067
01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.680
so I fucking missed out on it.
It was too busy trying to get on stage.
Oh,

1068
01:04:57.681 --> 01:04:58.101
by the way,

1069
01:04:58.101 --> 01:05:02.570
the ticket link for the all things comedy podcast festival is in Phoenix,

1070
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:05.630
is up@billboard.com for the first time ever.

1071
01:05:05.631 --> 01:05:10.631
I am going to do a live Monday morning podcast.

1072
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:13.280
Now the first thing is to be asking yourself as like,

1073
01:05:13.281 --> 01:05:18.250
you're going to have a guest?
No.
Are you going to address the no.

1074
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.020
I'm going to go out there.

1075
01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:22.330
I'm going to get a bed and I'm just going to lay down in it.

1076
01:05:22.331 --> 01:05:25.420
You guys are fucking sit there and watch it.
I don't know if it's going to work,

1077
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:28.840
but we'll see.
We'll see.
It's going to be more like a play.

1078
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:36.500
It's going to have headphones on.
I'm going to block out people laughing.
Um,

1079
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:38.140
I'm probably,
I have to react to the crowd,

1080
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:41.320
but I'm not going to be fucking going out there doing stand up or any of that.

1081
01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:44.160
I'm going to sit down and I'm just going to fucking do my part.
You again,

1082
01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:45.520
if you're just going to be able to watch it.

1083
01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.630
I got to have some sort of commemorative tee shirt or a poster or some shit,

1084
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:52.840
but that is going down in Phoenix,
Arizona fee.

1085
01:05:52.841 --> 01:05:56.290
I've never done the video thing I did at one time and it at the all things

1086
01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.960
comedy podcast I guess I did at one time,

1087
01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:03.520
but if you ever wanted to see what the fuck this shit looks like,
um,
who knows.

1088
01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:07.900
Maybe it won't work.
Like rap,
like rap live.
Remember when I'm in,
sorry,

1089
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:09.640
wrap with a live band.

1090
01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.750
I mean that when they tried to do that unplugged you only guy who ever pulled it

1091
01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:18.130
off was ll cool j.
He pulled it off.
Everybody else.
It just never,

1092
01:06:18.131 --> 01:06:23.090
it just didn't fucking work.
You got to add the guy on the turntables.
Um,

1093
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:26.950
I'm probably wrong about that but I just said it and I'm going to stick by it.

1094
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:31.000
All right.
Fat phobic.
Dear Billy Backbreaker,

1095
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:35.470
I'm a 28 year old white male living in Ohio.

1096
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:39.160
I had been single for nearly four years now.
Congratulations.

1097
01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.020
I consider myself to be an active guy.
Rock climbing,
going to the gym.

1098
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.980
Is this like your Tinder fucking bullshit and you're sending me,

1099
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:53.230
I like to rock climb,
go to the gym,
cycling,
et Cetera.
Anyways,

1100
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:58.240
I used to be overweight at 250 pounds and over the course of a year I was able

1101
01:06:58.241 --> 01:06:59.790
to get down to 172 pounds.

1102
01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:03.520
It maintain that due to the activeness and eating a plant based diet.

1103
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:08.170
Good for fucking you,
sir.
Making me fuck you're inspiring me.

1104
01:07:08.171 --> 01:07:12.430
Good for you man.
What a great thing you did.
My situation is this.

1105
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.480
I have some ladies that have expressed interest in me.
However,

1106
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:20.140
the majority of them are overweight and have no self control when it comes to

1107
01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:23.410
their diet and exercise.
I'm not attracted to bigger women,

1108
01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:28.411
which puts me in a difficult situation when they very openly flirt and invite me

1109
01:07:29.381 --> 01:07:31.750
out.
Why?
You're not attracted to them.

1110
01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:36.780
That's totally fine and it's totally fine to not be into overweight people.

1111
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.860
I don't know why.

1112
01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:42.520
You have to pretend that you're in the people that you're not into.

1113
01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:44.710
So the person,
you know,

1114
01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:48.280
eating the fucking Drake's cake can feel good about themselves.
What about you?

1115
01:07:48.281 --> 01:07:51.430
There's still a victim in there.
Okay.

1116
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:56.200
And considering being on a shape is curable for most people.

1117
01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:59.290
I'm not saying it's not a disease,
but for most people they do what you do.

1118
01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:02.950
Plant based Diet.
They get active and to fucking falls off.

1119
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:05.920
Plus considering you are a fatty,

1120
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.610
this is like an alcoholic.
You know who got sober,

1121
01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:11.050
you're going to go hang out with an alcoholic.

1122
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:14.440
I guarantee you'll become a fat fuck hanging out with them.
All right?

1123
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.160
And that way you're going to be,

1124
01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:19.520
you're going to be laying down and she tries to ride you on top.

1125
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:21.650
I hope you got enough to fucking still get it in there.

1126
01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.940
You to belly slapping together.
You don't have to be part of that,
do you?
Uh,

1127
01:08:25.941 --> 01:08:30.680
the ladies can turn down men,
no problem.
But when a man turns down a lady,

1128
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:34.100
some of the ladies I work with in their close friends,
I've known for years,

1129
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.920
some of the ladies I work with and are close friends I've known for years.
Well,

1130
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:38.330
why the fuck would you date them anyways?

1131
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.140
They know that I've been single for four years.
Honestly,

1132
01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:46.250
I am picky and I've also learned to be happy after multiple bad relationships.

1133
01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:48.830
Dude,
you are fucking crushing life right now.

1134
01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.160
Don't fuck it up by dating some fatty that you work with because society is

1135
01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:57.900
telling you that you're not progressive if you don't.
Anyway,

1136
01:08:57.901 --> 01:09:01.160
so when I deny a date request or don't flirt back with them,

1137
01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.830
they say that I'm fat phobic.

1138
01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.530
Is this what this has come to?
Um,

1139
01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:17.180
like if some fat fucking mantated Douche came walking up to them pressing his

1140
01:09:17.971 --> 01:09:20.550
dick up against,
I mean that's what the fuck they're doing to you

1141
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.290
sticking their fucking clam in your face.

1142
01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.630
Smelling like a Jim Dandy Sunday at friendlies.
Right?
They didn't,
what the fuck?

1143
01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.660
Fuck off.
I'm not fat phobic.

1144
01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:39.640
I just weighed 172 pounds and I know that I can get a better fucking cut of

1145
01:09:39.641 --> 01:09:42.420
meat.
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to go.

1146
01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:45.780
That means I'm just saying cause the Fed phobic piss me off.
All right,

1147
01:09:45.781 --> 01:09:50.570
you should respect everybody.
Just say,
listen.
Um,

1148
01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:55.290
I used to be fat like you and I started rock climbing.
Why don't you rock climb?

1149
01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:56.940
Okay.

1150
01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.910
Or at least maybe just stare at a bunch of rocks instead of eating rocky road

1151
01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:01.350
ice cream every fucking weekend.

1152
01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:06.240
Maybe I'll throw your bang every once in a while is dice clay says not troll a

1153
01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:08.400
bank.
Yeah.
Dude,
can I tell you something right now,

1154
01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:14.690
this fucking woman's movement thing is completely out of control.

1155
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.810
It's completely out of control.
They are not all of them,

1156
01:10:18.811 --> 01:10:22.530
but so many of them are everything that they're fucking preaching that they

1157
01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:27.500
don't want guys to do to them,
okay?
There,

1158
01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:32.570
you know you have the absolute 100% right to date.

1159
01:10:33.211 --> 01:10:34.890
Whoever the fuck you want to date.

1160
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:38.310
You have the right to be as shallow as you fucking want to be.

1161
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.830
You could date for looks for 10 fucking years if you want to before you want to

1162
01:10:43.831 --> 01:10:47.160
settle down and get serious.
You know,
and if you wait too long,

1163
01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:50.510
you're going to pay the price.
But it's your life.
The linen.
This is,

1164
01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.930
this is your fucking life,
dude.

1165
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:58.000
You're going to date some fucking fatty and you don't want to just so what the,

1166
01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:02.540
those constant work,
we'll look at you in a better way.
I,

1167
01:11:02.541 --> 01:11:06.110
I wouldn't do that.
Just be like,
yeah,
my dance card is full.

1168
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:11.300
All right,
this,
these are the measurements I like and I'm not ashamed of it.
Okay?

1169
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:15.360
That's what I find attractive
as do you,

1170
01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:18.420
can I tell you something?
All of those women at work,

1171
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:23.010
if they could be the size that you find attractive would be,

1172
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.000
you know what I mean?
And they ate their way into that position.

1173
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:30.090
It's their job to eat the way out.
The same way you did.

1174
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:32.910
So you had to get on a bike,
you had to climb a bunch of rocks,

1175
01:11:32.911 --> 01:11:37.500
you had to do all this shit.
Now you're,
you're in game shape,
right?

1176
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.120
You're fucking in Colby Bryan shape and there's showing up like shack and they

1177
01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:43.920
want to try to play their way into shape.

1178
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:49.800
Remember Colby stories give check shit for doing that.
Yeah.
Fuck that.
Anyways,

1179
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:52.080
he says,
I've never pointed out their weight,

1180
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.340
but when I have openly expressed interest in other women while talking to the

1181
01:11:56.341 --> 01:12:00.510
other guys at work,
that women start to shame me.
All right,
dude.
You know what?

1182
01:12:00.511 --> 01:12:05.330
I was on your side until you said shame.
What it,
what the fuck happened to him?

1183
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.260
What happened to people?
They shame you.

1184
01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:12.400
You just fucking laugh at them saying that.

1185
01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:16.200
Only like bones and twigs.
Uh,

1186
01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:19.470
I get along with everybody so I never strike back.

1187
01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:24.150
What's your problem with anything in fear that I might be taken to HR for God

1188
01:12:24.151 --> 01:12:25.380
knows what in days.

1189
01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:30.980
Also having denied some of the women they've gone as far as to not speak to me

1190
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:37.640
as much until other female core coworkers.
How horrible of a man I am.

1191
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:42.920
Leaving them to have bad attitudes against me just because I won't date them.
Uh,

1192
01:12:43.190 --> 01:12:46.340
do,
what do you look like,
Burt Reynolds?
What the fuck's going on here?
I would,
uh,

1193
01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.250
yeah.
Listen,
this is the deal.

1194
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.200
Women go to HR guys,
just laugh at it.
So just laugh at it,
dude.

1195
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:58.100
You know what I would do?
I would be overly friendly to the ones that hate me.

1196
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.220
You know,
morning.
So you look lovely today.

1197
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.460
Kill them with kindness.

1198
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:13.970
And then I would bring the most smoking hot fucking chick you could find to the

1199
01:13:14.191 --> 01:13:18.360
fucking Christmas party.
That's what you got to do anyways.
He says it's true.

1200
01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:22.470
I'm not attracted to big a women.
That's fine.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1201
01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:27.000
But women sit around all day talking about guys having to be this tall,

1202
01:13:27.001 --> 01:13:29.520
have this fair,
she'll hair,
wear these clothes.

1203
01:13:29.521 --> 01:13:33.270
But when a man has any sort of criteria,
we get shamed.
Dude,

1204
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:36.410
stop saying that.
Okay?

1205
01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:40.370
Being shamed is totally within your own power at the age that you're at.
Okay?

1206
01:13:40.371 --> 01:13:43.310
If you're a fucking teenager or younger,
I get it.
All right?

1207
01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.520
But at some point you gotta be comfortable with how you look.
Okay?

1208
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:50.330
You got to get comfortable with yourself and then someone can't shame you unless

1209
01:13:50.331 --> 01:13:54.980
you actually did something shameful.
Yeah.
If he kicked the puppy across the room,

1210
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.061
you know what I mean?

1211
01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:58.370
You don't want to be comfortable enough with yourself that you can handle the

1212
01:13:58.371 --> 01:14:02.390
criticism and have it not affect.
You should feel shame.
All right.
Anyways,

1213
01:14:02.391 --> 01:14:02.571
he goes,

1214
01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:05.660
I'm writing to hopefully get your take on the matter and hear what you would do

1215
01:14:05.661 --> 01:14:06.560
in this situation.

1216
01:14:06.561 --> 01:14:11.561
I will never see desiring of fit healthy person who about their body as a bad

1217
01:14:13.331 --> 01:14:14.350
thing.
No,
you shouldn't.

1218
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.740
And that's something that all people should aspire to be fit and in shape,

1219
01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.720
healthier than they were yesterday as much as you can.
I,
you know,

1220
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:24.070
obviously the aging process,

1221
01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:29.100
you're getting older every second one step closer to the grave.
Right.

1222
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:32.740
But,
you know,
in the meantime,
yeah.
Uh,
thanks for all the good laughs.

1223
01:14:32.741 --> 01:14:37.150
You and Nia are the friends.
I wish I had real life.
That's so nice.

1224
01:14:37.151 --> 01:14:40.610
Have a good day and go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
Dude.
It,
by the way,

1225
01:14:40.611 --> 01:14:45.190
that goes for women too,
goes for women too.
All right.
Um,

1226
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.410
yeah,
Dave,
what the fuck you want to date?
And if you want to be shallow,

1227
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:56.780
you know,
in dish date hot people that just do that.
See what that's like.

1228
01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:03.080
It's up to you.
I don't understand.
You know what I mean?
Like the,

1229
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:06.950
you know what you have at work,
dude,
you have a bunch of busy bodies,
you know,

1230
01:15:06.951 --> 01:15:10.130
and there's these people out there that want to be the person to say I age it is

1231
01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:13.310
this person to that person.
Um

1232
01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.040
Oh dude,
I swear to God man.
I swear to God,

1233
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:20.860
you find the hottest fucking check you can fucking find.

1234
01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:25.570
You could fucking fine.
Take it to the God damn Christmas party.
And by the way,

1235
01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:29.080
let her know what's up.
Let her know what's up.

1236
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:32.750
I would say I would fight,
I would tell some fucking,

1237
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:36.200
I would tell some hot chick that whole fucking story and you know,

1238
01:15:36.201 --> 01:15:37.460
hot chicks love being hot.

1239
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:40.490
Nothing that they would make them feel hotter than to go down there and have a

1240
01:15:40.491 --> 01:15:43.790
bunch of women look at her and just hate her because how fucking hot she is.

1241
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:47.630
There you go.
Find that check.
Maybe she's into sports too.

1242
01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.830
Next thing you know,
you guys are running the country,
not the country,

1243
01:15:51.831 --> 01:15:55.770
that company.
That's perfect.

1244
01:15:56.610 --> 01:16:00.680
Ah,
it's a fan of see,
but maybe you can make it happen,
sir.
Um,

1245
01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.600
good luck to you.
Good luck to you.
And that's it.
And by the way,

1246
01:16:05.601 --> 01:16:09.920
there's plenty of guys out there that like big women,
you know what I mean?

1247
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:11.903
That's plenty.

1248
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.970
It's up to you to be happy with your own fucking body.
All right up telling you,

1249
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:24.460
telling you just fucking have a salad,
have one fucking salad a day.

1250
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.750
Start fucking working out.
Read up as much as you can on nutrition.

1251
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:33.790
Try the best you can.
Eat the best food you can,
which is really difficult,

1252
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.650
you know,
so he could do then.
Other than that,

1253
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:43.390
leave people alone and let them date.
Who the fuck they want a date.
Um,

1254
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.160
all right,
that is the podcast for this week.
Go fuck yourselves.

1255
01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.210
And A,
I'll give you my fucking pick of the week on Thursday.
That's it.

1256
01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:56.410
When I'm in Tampa up,
up,
up,
up,
up our Thursday night football.
Oh God.

1257
01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:59.470
They're going to be wearing those ugly,
under rude fucking jerseys.

1258
01:16:59.471 --> 01:17:02.620
What do they call them?
The a full court press jerseys,

1259
01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:05.260
whatever the fuck they call them.
All right.
That's it.
Go fuck yourselves.

1260
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:07.540
All a check in on you on Thursday.
