00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.780
2016 what's going on when June two limos,

4
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.781
Yuma bell gill a shiver dre says what's on cat team who play?

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.700
I can't fucking say it anymore,
man.
I'm ready to come home.

6
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.440
I've had a great time over here.
Uh,
and uh,
you know,

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.630
but no matter how much of a good time you haven't,

8
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.740
at some point you miss you stuff.
You want to go home and see your dog,

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.780
you know,
you'd just like to fucking speak your own lane.

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.690
I'm so fucking sick of trying to speak this shit over here.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.160
I'm having a great time.
My French is better than it's ever been.
Uh,

12
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.710
but I am fucking,
you know,

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.210
the memes shows seafood play.
That means more of the same.

14
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.780
If you ever in a bar and you finally get your fucking out whatever you wanted,

15
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.230
you know what I mean?
You know?
Juva Dre,

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.750
my fucking Jack Daniels on ice or whatever,

17
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.140
when she get that shit out and they know what the fuck you saying when they come

18
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:16.830
back,
you know,
and they're like,
you know,
we miss you.

19
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:19.260
It was a little bit of a disability.
You just point your glass,

20
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:24.261
you go the memes shows CBRE play and they go and they walk away and they come

21
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.810
back and magically they give you another fucking uh,

22
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.630
and one of the glass or whatever the fuck you just ordered.
And um,

23
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.770
I also found out over here then I like green beans,

24
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.670
green beans.
It's like,
oh,
I whatever,
you know,

25
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.900
I forget what they call him over here.
Arrow.
God,
I can't even remember.

26
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.790
I fucking look at it and I can read it and I not to say,
you know,
uh,

27
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.440
you know,
Java Dre,
a salad area,
God spared bat,

28
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.760
whatever the fuck you say.
Right?

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.690
And all it is is green beans is a little bit of fucking this mustard dressing

30
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:04.560
they put on him and I got to tell you,
it's out of this fucking world.

31
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.820
So much shit over here that I don't like over in the states is really out of

32
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:14.070
this world over here.
And um,

33
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.430
and I've been eating like a fucking animal over here and I haven't really been

34
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:22.290
putting on the weight that I put on when I'm in the states because I don't know

35
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:27.120
what the fuck they do.
Even like the,
uh,
the chicken,
uh,

36
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.190
Tulay a
roti superbly.
See what Blair?

37
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.580
Right fucking rotisserie chicken over here.

38
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:39.930
I swear to God our chicken over there is on steroids.
I don't know what's going,

39
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.470
I don't know what the deal is.
Like we bought a full chicken and you know,

40
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.700
I'm not gonna lie to you.

41
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.840
I was a little buzzed and I can carve a chicken or a Turkey,

42
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.710
like nobody's fucking business.
Why?
Because I'm some sort of chef.
No,

43
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:55.080
cause I watched a youtube video that broke it down.

44
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.080
So I'm sitting there and looking at this chicken and like I said,

45
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.980
I was a couple of drinks and I couldn't

46
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 1>figure out where the breast meat was.</v>

47
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

48
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.640
<v 1>I couldn't tell really the top from the bottom of the thing because I'm so used</v>

49
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.970
to our Mark McGuire roid it up fucking chickens that you know,

50
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.160
it's puffing up like it's going to Gold's fucking over.
Right.

51
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.820
And uh,
yeah,
it's just,

52
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.250
it's like Dick Chicken over here looks like a fitness model right where ours

53
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.410
looks like.
Who's that guy in the Astros?

54
00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:30.880
It played third base that never got busted for fucking looking like,
uh,

55
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.110
the same body type is Robert Newhouse.
That's what I'm chicken looks like.

56
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.550
And um,

57
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.580
<v 2>okay.</v>

58
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.670
<v 1>Yeah,
the green beans are smaller and they're way more tastier.</v>

59
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.790
And I was over here going,
I fucking love green beans.
I didn't know that.

60
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.850
I think that the ones we have over where we're at,

61
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.280
they shit and I'm not trashing America.

62
00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:52.460
I'm not being one of these concept goes to another country and go,
oh my God,

63
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.150
everything they have over here,
it's fucking wonderful.
I'm not saying that,

64
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.490
let's say in that at all.
I'm just saying that,
uh,
yeah,

65
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.040
I'm actually talking to the rest of the world that makes fun of how fucking fat

66
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.490
Americans are.
Like date.
I Dunno.

67
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.000
I Dunno what happened,
but there's,

68
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:14.860
there's something wrong with that goddamn food.
Um,
having said that though,

69
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.990
I would rather look at a fat American then affect European because at least in

70
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:24.540
American it's some point in his life,
did a fucking pushup and as some sort of a,

71
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.960
some sort of shoulders in some arms and a little bit of jest on them.

72
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.570
These fucking fatties over here,
they're just,
they're like a,

73
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.210
they get like chick bodies.

74
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.530
Like they never did a pull up in their life or anything and then they just get

75
00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:46.940
fat and then they keep wearing the tight tee shirt,
you know?

76
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.640
<v 1>Like those gay guys do.
The gay guys who West Hollywood,</v>

78
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.640
I don't give a fuck what shape they're in.
They wear it tight shelf.

79
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.310
But the gay dudes in America at least,
at least have the decency dig,

80
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.670
still trying that go into the gym.
So they don't look that bad.

81
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.720
At least they got the guts,
some fucking guns on them.
You know,

82
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.410
they got some packs,
right.
Some older guy packs.

83
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.690
I mean I should talk right now.
That's what I look like.

84
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.220
I look like a fucking Tuesday afternoon stripper right now with my shirt off.

85
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.630
You know,
you could see how at one point maybe I used to dance on Saturday night,

86
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:29.190
but now I've had like two or three fucking kids out of wedlock too.

87
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:33.720
So it was a hard two or three,
right?
No fuckin alimony.

88
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.230
Even if I know who the fuck and father is,
he doesn't have any money.

89
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:41.190
You can't get blood from the stone.
That dude sitting in jail,
you know,

90
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:44.790
it's stupid.
He should be out driving a truck somewhere.
Right?

91
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.010
Why the fuck isn't my laptop charging?
Yeah.

92
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.200
That's another thing I'm fucking sick of.

93
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:53.870
I'm sick of this fucking whack of American electricity.
Have A,
Ah,

94
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.530
I'm just a fucking grouchy cut right now.
Um,

95
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 0>but having said all that,
you know,
we're still having a great time over here.</v>

96
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.240
I'm just a,
you don't even realize,

97
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:08.570
I haven't really been vacationing over here as much as I bet on like a seven day

98
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.430
bender.
It's like,
I gotta get,

99
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.060
I gotta stop.
Like at some point,
we finally just said like,
you know,

100
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:21.890
when we live at home,
you know,
we don't go out to a bar every night.
You just,

101
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.130
when you're on vacation,
you feel like,
oh,
I got to do something every night.

102
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:29.540
And one of those things you could do is actually relax and get a good night's

103
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:33.920
sleep,
you know,
and you would think,
you know,

104
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.260
being a cat,

105
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:41.000
those says how the fuck you say it kept to a cease,

106
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.320
I just did a youtube thing.
I said 16 first,

107
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.520
soon to be and a cat toy as Catera cata sets.

108
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.040
That's where it'd be on,
on Wednesday and Thursday.
Mcity as your Dick.

109
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.440
I don't fucking,
I just woke up.
Fuck you.
Um,

110
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.810
anyways,
uh,

111
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.020
you'd think being almost 47 years old that I would have learned that by now,

112
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.320
but I didn't,
you know,
and there's probably a lot of you looking down on me,

113
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.600
like I'm some sort of fucking asshole.

114
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.720
But now you never really learned that lesson either.

115
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.600
What happened to you is you got married and you had a fucking kid.

116
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.320
And from what I've heard from parents whose kids don't give a fuck about a

117
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.170
hangover.
So just because you don't want to deal with your kid,

118
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:26.750
you stopped drinking or maybe you love the thing,

119
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.800
right to the point where you don't want to be the drunk mom or dad.

120
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:34.280
But I swear to God,
you know,
parents,
anytime they get a chance for the most part,

121
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.170
they steal away a couple of minutes,

122
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.780
the grandparents come over and take the kids.

123
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.370
They're immediately in the liquor cabinet.
Right.
All right,
well there you go.

124
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.960
Sorry.
You know what?
This really is,

125
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:46.880
is me just feeling like I'm drinking too much.

126
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:49.670
So instead I got a fucking lash shouted at.

127
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:51.680
People never really said anything to me.

128
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.440
Maybe it just sitting there with a kid going,
hey bill,
you know,

129
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.970
just kind of enjoying the podcast.

130
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.510
There's no reason for you to be a cunt to me cause yeah,

131
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:03.260
you're a freckled Boosie back.
And you know what?
I'll take that.
I will take that.

132
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.030
You know what?
You're right.
And I apologize.

133
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.270
You see that trying to be more mature.
Um,

134
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.780
so anyways,
uh,
also,
you know what the thing is,

135
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.730
is yesterday I went to the French Open and that was like the big thing that I

136
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:24.720
wanted to do.
So I think mentally I kind of checked out like,
God,

137
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.430
I'm done.
I'm done.
I had the coolest Saul's.
I had the Baguettes,

138
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.090
I sat in the cafes and I fucking did whatever the fuck I did.

139
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.090
I went to the French Open,
you know,

140
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.970
I took my lady out on her birthday,

141
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.580
I got her a really nice gift.

142
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.580
I feel like I'm done like roll credits and uh,

143
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:51.190
I still got two days here before I fly back to three days for fly back.
And um,

144
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.160
but I don't want this,
this,
this is the calm before the storm,

145
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.380
you know,
rather than being depressed then it's almost over.

146
00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:01.840
I'm actually kind of excited cause I'm ready to go back,

147
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.610
but somewhere around two in the afternoon today it's going to hit me like,

148
00:09:06.611 --> 00:09:08.110
oh fuck,
you know,

149
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:12.490
I only got another two and a half days here and then the drink is going to start

150
00:09:12.491 --> 00:09:13.324
all over again.

151
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.840
And there is something about the fact that Jim Morrison died in this town,

152
00:09:16.841 --> 00:09:19.420
that you really feel like a pussy if you just fucking go home.

153
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.190
So when I'm saying to you is,

154
00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:24.520
I'm going to be fucking hammered until about Wednesday.
[inaudible]

155
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.090
um,
okay.

156
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.840
So this is the Monday morning podcast.
Uh,

157
00:09:31.841 --> 00:09:34.960
you know what I did the other night before I went to the,
the French Open,

158
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.990
I got my NHL feed to work and I watched game to have a Tampa Bay versus Chicago

159
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.780
and um,
what a fucking game,
what a series.

160
00:09:46.781 --> 00:09:51.370
I'm so psyched that I actually was able to see that because I'm fucking missing

161
00:09:51.371 --> 00:09:56.350
the calves Sacramento series,
as I called it last week.
The calves,
uh,

162
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.430
golden state series.
Um,

163
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.350
it looks like a classic.
I don't think the first game went into overtime,

164
00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:08.150
but I know that the,
uh,
the uh,

165
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:14.010
warriors one by two and then last night the Cavaliers won by two and overtime.

166
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.690
And I just saw the look on the Cavaliers faces,
like,
you know,

167
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.220
after they had won it,
like it was that combination of,

168
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.930
of happiness and anger lay just like,
all right,
these guys are fucking dialed in.

169
00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:31.460
This is going to be a hell of a series.

170
00:10:31.461 --> 00:10:34.130
And I did see something funny on the NBA website.

171
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.680
I'm talking about Steph Curry.

172
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.700
It says one bad night or something worse,

173
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.470
which is the classic symptom of all these different sports outlets that,

174
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.160
you know,
someone just can't have a bad game.
All of a sudden it's got to be a,

175
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.000
Oh my God,
it's the fucking sky falling.
Okay.
So

176
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.330
anyways,
um,
I watched the,
I watch game too,

177
00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:03.650
even though I know knew I had to be up by a,

178
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.240
had to be over at roll on Gals by fucking 11:00 AM so I had to be up at 10 in

179
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:14.250
the fucking hockey game.
Didn't come on until like fucking one in the morning.

180
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:17.200
So I was up till four in the morning watching that shit going.

181
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.060
I don't give a fuck.
I'm watching this shit.
And,
um,

182
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.850
first of all,
like an asshole.

183
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.910
I thought that I had to be over at the French Open at 11:00 AM cause I just

184
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:32.970
thought it was the men's finals and that was it.
And um,

185
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.651
by the way,

186
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:39.360
I'm sick of people giving me shit on Twitter for at the Stanley Cup finals my

187
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:41.400
whole life.
We call it the Stanley Cup finals.

188
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.840
It was the NBA finals and the Stanley Cup finals.
And people go,

189
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.830
there's not more than one final.
Well tell that to the fucking NBA.
All right?

190
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.810
I don't give a fuck.
You're fucking dramatic content.

191
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.710
I've watched all of them.
I've watched every Stanley Cup,
final or final,

192
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.560
whatever the fuck you want to call it,
since the fucking islanders.

193
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:07.360
Fourth Championship.
All right,

194
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:12.361
so you going back to 1983 of which 33 of them to go fuck yourself about whether

195
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:14.680
there's an s there or not.
I don't care.

196
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:17.470
And I also was calling it the Stanley Cup finals my whole fucking life.

197
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.690
And nobody ever gave me shit.
Once again,

198
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.110
maybe that's because now I just feel stupid and I'm lashing out at you.

199
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.360
Maybe you were just saying,
Hey,
bill,
not trying to be a dick,

200
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:28.480
but aids the Stanley Cup final.
That's how the NHL,

201
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:32.020
the League that you watched decides to call it,
whatever.

202
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.840
So I watched that shit,

203
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:37.790
the Stanley Cup final until uh,

204
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.310
4:00 AM cats and um,

205
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.390
<v 2>okay,</v>

206
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.760
<v 0>so we fucking get up out of bed</v>

207
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.123
<v 2>and uh,</v>

208
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.610
<v 0>we go over to the fucking subway
and not trying to figure it out.
We,</v>

209
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.340
we went into like the way you had to buy the a,

210
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:02.140
the tickets and it was really confusing,
super confusing.
There was all,
you know,

211
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.960
which,
how far into bout of Paris do you want to go?

212
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.720
There was like three different level of tickets to buy.

213
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.610
It was a complete fucking pain in the ass.
So we asked the lady in a,

214
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.870
behind the booth and she was a total content.
She was on the phone,

215
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.570
hated her fucking job,
was just an asshole.

216
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.140
This is nothing against French people are per regions because everybody's been

217
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.690
an absolute sweetheart to us over here.
Um,

218
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.070
and very patient as I try to speak French,
you know.
And,
um,

219
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:32.410
so we just said fuck it.
We got out and we got a cab.

220
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:33.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

221
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.840
<v 0>Yeah,
we cruised over and we get over there.
Right.</v>

222
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.350
And we just breezed through.
There's like no fucking line.

223
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.540
You know,
I walk into the gift shop,
there's nobody in there.

224
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.400
I'm looking around,
I'm like,
wow,
this is some really ugly merchandise.

225
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.770
And then I realized it's the last day of the tournament,

226
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:57.910
all the good shit is gone,
which struck me as funny,
but I still got a Mug,

227
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.140
a hat and a shirt and the beach towel.
It was a big,

228
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.700
that was a big bucket list thing for me.

229
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:06.910
I always wanted to go to this fucking thing.
So in Nia,

230
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:10.390
this is the funniest thing ever.
She was so fucking,

231
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.570
she was over it before we even got there.
She doesn't give a fuck.

232
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.460
She did just did not give a shit on any level.

233
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.410
And I was asking her
about something,

234
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:27.970
I forget what she said and I just could tell the way she said it.
Um,

235
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.810
I was like,
Oh hey,
check it out.
You know,
I,

236
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.810
I didn't think they had my size by one over the other side.
I finally showed,

237
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.560
they actually had my size and she just goes,
oh yeah,

238
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:44.170
I just started,
I just burst out laughing,
which made her laugh.

239
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:49.300
And I was like,
I,
I just said to,
I said,
look,
I know you don't want to be here.

240
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.520
I know that like how you're feeling right now is how I feel when I sit down.

241
00:14:54.521 --> 00:14:57.820
When you go to try something on at a fucking department store,

242
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.430
except this is going to take three fucking hours.
So I apologize.

243
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.370
You know,
let me go find you some booze,
right?

244
00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:11.371
So I got her some champagne and shit and she's just trashing me and trashing

245
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:16.010
like the people that are there and all the fucking thing,
you know,

246
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.420
and just making me laugh my ass off.
And she's trying to be a sweetheart.
Go.
No,

247
00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.600
no,
no.
I know this is a big thing for you.
I know you're,

248
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:27.740
you want to enjoy yourself here and then,
and how much,
just laugh,
go look at you.

249
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:30.590
You,
you want to just jump out of your own skin,
you sell,

250
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:33.500
don't want to fucking be here right now.
So,
um,

251
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.360
and all I'm doing is looking around going,
why isn't this barely anybody here?

252
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:40.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

253
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.020
<v 0>And then I thought,
I figured it out going,
oh,</v>

254
00:15:43.021 --> 00:15:45.270
I know why because there's only one match today.

255
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.250
Whereas before I've gone to these tennis tournaments and there's like,
you know,

256
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:55.040
this does the,
the semipro things going on on the,

257
00:15:55.041 --> 00:15:59.400
the satellite courts,
there's like,
you know,
four or five d,
You know,

258
00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:03.090
different matches going on to different venues.

259
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.270
Some people just have tickets for the first half of the day,

260
00:16:06.271 --> 00:16:08.450
some for the whole day,
some for the late ones.

261
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:10.380
So there's this whole overlap and crowd.

262
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.830
Then I realized that that's not what it was.

263
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:19.730
I realized that it was 11:00 AM and that the men's final did not start until

264
00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:26.421
3:00 PM and then what was actually happening at 12 noon was the final for the

265
00:16:29.761 --> 00:16:30.960
women's doubles.

266
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>

267
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.540
<v 0>Fucking class.</v>

268
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.230
And I realized at that point that not only was near going to be there for three

269
00:16:40.231 --> 00:16:43.590
hours of that she was going to be there for the three hours of the men final

270
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:48.630
men's final.
And,
uh,
and just the look on her fucking face.

271
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.420
I feel real bad.
I completely wore out,
um,

272
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.910
yesterday and uh,
so anyways,

273
00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.880
and I'm sitting there going like,
I fucking hate doubles tennis.

274
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.110
So now it's like I owe it all.
I'm sick.

275
00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:05.070
It's like we both could have still slept in because you sit sitting there like

276
00:17:05.071 --> 00:17:05.904
zombies,

277
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.730
cause I kind of kept her up cause I was cheering on the game and everything.

278
00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.650
And uh,
so we get over there and it's like,
well fuck can,

279
00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:17.700
we might as well going in and watch the women's doubles final.

280
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.160
And I went in there and this is the most fucked up thing to the,

281
00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:26.070
there was like fucking 70 people in the crowd

282
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.560
for a tennis major final.
And uh,

283
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.520
we went in there and I watched the fucking match and knee at some points.
Like,

284
00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:39.120
Oh,
I'm gonna go down and go get a go get whatever the fuck a glass of wine or

285
00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:41.010
something.
And she goes,
I need to walk around.

286
00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:44.010
I'm gonna Fall Asleep because you know,
we've been sleeping until like one.

287
00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:47.960
So we've just as it was still fucking jet lagged or whatever or whatever.

288
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.830
Cause we've been going out till four in morning,
who's getting no,

289
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.070
<v 1>so she had to walk around just so she wouldn't fall asleep.</v>

290
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:58.071
And I sat there and I watched the match and I totally fucking got into it and

291
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:01.710
there was one American plane,
Bethany help me say it right.

292
00:18:01.711 --> 00:18:05.790
Maddix sands and I was watching her during the warmups and I was like going,

293
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:06.960
she's fucking good man.

294
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.760
And a then on the other team they had this really tall woman who played up near

295
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:14.940
the net the whole time and she was a fucking beast.

296
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:20.390
She was the shit and right out of the gate it just looked like the team with the

297
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:23.430
American one,
it was going to lose.

298
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:27.870
They just seemed over matched and all that and they lost the first set.

299
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.490
And I'm thinking like,
you know,
selfishly I'm thinking like,
oh well,
you know,

300
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.850
they lose the first set.
This'll be over quick.
You know what I mean?

301
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:40.620
They dropped the second set and then we're on to the men's fail,
right?
And uh,

302
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.050
they fucking came back
one the second set,

303
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.480
and then the other girls,
women,
they fucking bear down.
Hang on a second.

304
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:53.040
I've got to blow my fucking nose.
Hold up

305
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.280
and magically on back two seconds later.
So the other women,

306
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.240
they just fucking immediately the third set,

307
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.250
they just do just fucking come out swinging.
And it just looks like,

308
00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:09.860
all right,
now they're going to take over.
They had to,

309
00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:12.750
they had a little fucking brain fart in the second set.

310
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.860
And Dude,
it was like a heavyweight fight.
Then all of a sudden

311
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.830
the other girls started coming back.

312
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:22.020
I really should have their fucking names to championship names.

313
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:26.310
It was a Lucie Safarova,

314
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.080
Sephora rover and Bethany Madec Sands.
And they just fucking hung.

315
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.430
They're hung in there.
The fucking broke them.

316
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.430
<v 0>And then they put the fucking hammered down and they ended up winning.</v>

317
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.170
And it was a fucking awesome game.

318
00:19:38.171 --> 00:19:41.980
And I swear to God there was 70 fucking people in the crowd.

319
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.040
I took a picture of it.
I'll try a fucking,

320
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.890
I'm not going to be able to upload it to like get back here cause I didn't get a

321
00:19:47.891 --> 00:19:51.850
cell phone plan because I always get a cell phone plan when I go overseas and

322
00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:55.510
they go,
yeah,
you have unlimited minutes and texting,

323
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.940
you'll get a bill for like 70 bucks.

324
00:19:57.941 --> 00:20:00.670
And then I'd come home and it's always like fucking $400.

325
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

326
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:02.220
<v 0>You know,</v>

327
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.400
you're always there for like 20 minutes and it says warning your router,

328
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.410
your fucking minutes for the day.
Um,

329
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:09.720
<v 2>okay.</v>

330
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.470
<v 0>And then what are you going to do?
What are you going to do it?</v>

331
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.170
You're not going to take calls or whatever.
So I just have not been on my phone.

332
00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:17.810
I just shut the fucking thing off.
So anyways,

333
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:19.520
<v 2>yeah.</v>

334
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.170
<v 0>So we watched that had a great time.</v>

335
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.860
And then we came out and we were walking around and,
um,

336
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.180
and I dunno,

337
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.540
I was fighting this feeling because I always wanted to go to the French Open.

338
00:20:31.541 --> 00:20:34.540
And there was something when I was at the French Open that was just fucking

339
00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.620
bugging me and I couldn't figure out what it was.
And I was like,

340
00:20:38.621 --> 00:20:41.110
in my jetlagged and my not join this,

341
00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:44.020
cause I know my wife is enjoying this and

342
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.470
<v 2>okay,</v>

343
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.170
<v 0>blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
whatever.
So</v>

344
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.460
we ended up going in to the men final,
right?
And,
uh,

345
00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.523
it was,
uh,

346
00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.100
Novak Djokovic against this guy who I never heard of.

347
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.530
Stan is SLAs while Rinca.
So I'm sitting there and I see that,

348
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.430
you know what's his face isn't in it.
Who's that fucking guy wins it every year.

349
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.580
Uh,
Raphael Nay down,
right?
They're fucking guy.

350
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.240
I Dunno.
He won nine of the last 10 of them.

351
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.310
It's insane.
He won in 2005,
six,

352
00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.980
seven,
eight one,
two,
three,
four rows.
Anyone,
one,
two,
three,

353
00:21:34.981 --> 00:21:39.540
four,
five in a row.
No one can ever get the sex
right.

354
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.960
Roger Federer won in 2009 fucking up his,
his,
uh,

355
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:48.610
his 10 year run.
Um,
but I mean that,
that's,

356
00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.100
that's one of the one of them.
To me,

357
00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:52.830
that's one of the greatest accomplishments in,
in modern day sports.

358
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.240
Fox One nine out of 10 championships at the pro level.

359
00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.690
You got to go back to the Boston Celtics when they played in the 1960s and at

360
00:22:00.691 --> 00:22:05.520
Ymc a league.
Right.
So anyways,

361
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.020
and I'm just looking at this other guy.
This Stan is loss while Rinko.

362
00:22:10.021 --> 00:22:14.090
He's like ranked eighth.
And I lean over to my wife going,
I've got near man.

363
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.780
There you go.
This guy's got to get his fucking ass kicked.
All right.
Hey Dallas,

364
00:22:18.781 --> 00:22:22.680
not in it.
I don't know shit about tennis.
Right.
I just watched the majors.
Um,

365
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.320
and I'm just like,
this guy's going to get his fucking ass kicked this,
this,

366
00:22:25.321 --> 00:22:29.160
don't worry.
This will be over.
You know,
he'll probably one in three sets,

367
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.890
maybe four.
And so she's like,
okay.
All right.

368
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.770
So I'm sitting there watching the fucking thing.
All right.

369
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.750
In a Djokovich when's the first set?

370
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.630
And then the second set comes.
But,

371
00:22:42.631 --> 00:22:47.340
but like he only broke what Rinko once and then the second set,

372
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.210
this will Rinca dude,
it's just fucking,
he's coming like a champ.

373
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:56.510
He breaks Djokovich twice and he ends up winning like he lost the first set,

374
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.020
six,
six,

375
00:22:58.021 --> 00:23:02.160
four and then he won the second set six,
four.

376
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.350
And when the,
um,

377
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.820
<v 2>okay,</v>

378
00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.000
<v 0>when the set was over,
when geographers are lost,
the second set,</v>

379
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:14.850
he fucking,
uh,
he slammed his racket down on,
on the clay.

380
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.160
Any bounced up and he caught it and then he slammed it two more fucking times

381
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.390
and it broke and the whole crowd started bullying.

382
00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:30.110
Right.
And,
and I,
that's when it hit me.

383
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.130
It's like that's what it is.
I don't like this fucking crowd.

384
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.130
I don't like the crowd that goes to tennis matches.

385
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.090
I don't like how they whistle when they get upset,
they hiss.

386
00:23:41.091 --> 00:23:46.050
And if you show any sort of fucking emotion that's like anger,
like a,

387
00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:48.720
in the first set,
I think a,
that while Rinca guy,

388
00:23:48.721 --> 00:23:52.770
he fucking slammed his racket down twice on the net.
They bull.

389
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

390
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.750
<v 0>You know,
cause it's supposed to be a gentleman's game.
Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

391
00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:00.470
You're rich.
Cons.
How did you guys get your money?
Being a gentlemen,

392
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.570
you fucking bootleggers.
Gimme a break.
We've got a clothing line.
He got crying.

393
00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:09.050
Children's so in the shit together and you're fucking sitting here now try to

394
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:11.540
tell people how to act like a fucking gentlemen.
All right,

395
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:14.690
this is me judging these fucking rich countries,
right?
So,

396
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.520
and I realized in that moment I was like,

397
00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:18.080
that's why I don't fucking like this shit.

398
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.770
This is why I can never quite totally get into fucking tennis is because

399
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:24.050
whenever I go to to a live event,

400
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:29.770
there's that element there and fucking grey poupon pretending to be something

401
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:36.200
that you're not.
You know what I mean?
Like every time you stock doesn't go down,

402
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:38.420
you don't throw a chalice across the fucking,

403
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.520
your manner is just screaming at your stockbroker.

404
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.200
Give me a fucking break and now you're mad at this guy and his little short

405
00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:48.440
shorts,
I love one.
We'll rank a slam the racket down.

406
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:50.150
I saw that he wasn't intimidated by,

407
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.320
I saw that it was fucking mad at himself and he wanted to fucking win.

408
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.560
I saw Djokovich after the first set,
when he won his first set,

409
00:24:57.561 --> 00:25:00.710
he turned around and looked as coach and he pumped his fist and I was thinking,

410
00:25:00.711 --> 00:25:05.390
this guy's dialed in and now there's something about tennis when you fucking

411
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.840
blow assent to have to start all over again.

412
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

413
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.680
<v 0>You know,
at Ground Zero and have to fight all of those fucking games again and,</v>

414
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.220
and block out the fact that,
dude,
I could just be one set away.
Instead,

415
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:23.630
I'm tired and we've been playing for a fucking hour and a half and we're still

416
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:27.800
tied.
And this is annoying.
Like these,
all of that,

417
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:32.420
like those moments where you're starting to give the match away and it's like,

418
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:34.400
do you have it in you to come back?

419
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:36.030
And then you watch and the other person going,

420
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.920
does this person have it in him to finish this other guy off?

421
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.360
And um,

422
00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:42.580
<v 2>yeah.</v>

423
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.960
<v 0>So anyways,
one Rinca ends up winning the third scent.</v>

424
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.200
So now he's up to the one and I'm like,
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck?

425
00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:51.820
And then joke of it's just digs in.

426
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.660
His fucking comes out and when's the first three games of the fourth set?

427
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.170
And I'm like,
yeah,
this guy's got these,
got the championship gene,

428
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.790
this is going to go five.
And then this one rink,

429
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:03.910
a guy is going to have to think like,
wow man,

430
00:26:03.911 --> 00:26:05.930
I had this guy in the ropes and I let him off and he's,

431
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.680
he going to have it in him to fucking come back.

432
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.710
So these guys are showing emotion and every time they show anger,

433
00:26:11.711 --> 00:26:14.950
these fucking rich blue blood cons are bullying them.

434
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.550
It's like you're watching two fucking warriors down here when you're born,

435
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.700
the some of the best part of the game,
they get mad cause they want to,

436
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:25.880
when you're [inaudible],
this is phenomenal tennis.

437
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.350
So Eddie's,
well anyways,
fucking Stanislaus.

438
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.170
Just fucking
all of a sudden,
okay,
he's serving.

439
00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:37.250
So then he wins.

440
00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:41.930
It's three one and then he breaks Djokovich three two and then he wins his neck

441
00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:46.200
servicing.
It's fucking three.
And I'm sitting there looking at,

442
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:48.790
nick ain't going like this might be over and forth.

443
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.000
This guy can fucking hang on and finish him off.

444
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:54.600
And then also you can finally go home and sleep.
And um,

445
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.670
<v 2>okay.</v>

446
00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.190
<v 0>That's what ended up happened.
Uh,
one weekend ended up coming back and it was,</v>

447
00:27:00.191 --> 00:27:02.790
it was a crazy thing because,
you know,
I don't watch a lot of tennis.

448
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.010
And so at first I was for Djokovich cause I knew that he had never won and he

449
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:09.810
was going to get the career Grand Slam,

450
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:13.650
which is basically winning on all three surfaces,
hardcore grass and clay.

451
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.400
And then this one rink a guy,
I don't,
I didn't think he'd have a one,
a major,

452
00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:20.340
which I still don't think he did.
I don't know shit about tennis obviously.

453
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:25.050
And uh,
so I was kind of rooting for him.
Plus there was a ton of Djokovich fans.

454
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.250
So immediately it's like,
Oh man,
this,
you know,
fuck these rich content.

455
00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:30.480
I want to see,
uh,
the Swiss,

456
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:33.840
the Swiss guy when just to watch all these people have to put their flags down.

457
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.420
Oh,
that was another thing too,
when people would yell out,
you know,

458
00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.290
<v 2>okay,</v>

459
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.950
<v 0>all these,
uh,
these,
uh,
what,
what,
what is,
what does Djokovich she's,</v>

460
00:27:44.951 --> 00:27:49.270
I'm Serbian or something.
And when they would yell out all their Serbian shit,

461
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.370
like every once in a while somebody English speaking person would go,
shut up.

462
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:55.420
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

463
00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.200
<v 0>It's an,
I'm sorry,
I'm not supposed to cheer.
That's another thing.</v>

464
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:00.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

465
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:01.810
<v 0>About certain these,</v>

466
00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:06.811
these fucking Hoity toity sports like golf and everything high very is to shut

467
00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:10.150
the fuck up.
Has to be perfectly quiet.

468
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.740
If anybody liked fucking shuffles in this seat and takes a picture,

469
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:19.920
is somebody going to Putt or fucking to the,
Oh,
he hit the tennis ball like the,

470
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:24.820
the,
the,
the athlete.
Go glares at him.
It's like,

471
00:28:24.821 --> 00:28:28.270
are you fucking kidding me?
You hear what people do?
See what people are doing.

472
00:28:28.271 --> 00:28:32.020
When somebody has taken a foul shot of fucking trying to kick a field goal,

473
00:28:32.021 --> 00:28:36.970
these goddamn golfers and tennis players,
they'd start fucking crying.
So,

474
00:28:36.971 --> 00:28:40.360
I don't know,
I'm not 100% sold on it,
but I will say it was,

475
00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.040
it was one of the great events that I've ever been to and I would definitely go

476
00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:49.900
to it again.
Um,
I wouldn't drag my wife to it.

477
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.660
Uh,
I've now been to three of the majors.

478
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.700
The only one left I have to go to is Wimbledon.

479
00:28:54.701 --> 00:28:56.470
So next time I go to England or something,

480
00:28:56.471 --> 00:28:59.240
I'll try to set it up around that and uh,

481
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:03.340
I'll go to that and I won't drag it to it.
It should be like,
no,
I want to go.

482
00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.620
I like it.
I like to dress up and it's like you don't like it.

483
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.113
Um,

484
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.240
<v 2>yeah.</v>

485
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.510
<v 0>So anyways,
that was a,
that was the experience.
And uh,</v>

486
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.670
<v 2>okay.</v>

487
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.240
<v 0>Another thing too,
when I got there,
you just can't believe I'm a fucking small.</v>

488
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:23.060
It is.
It's like this major,

489
00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:26.510
it's this big time championship and this,

490
00:29:26.511 --> 00:29:30.530
it's this little intimate thing.
Like I swear to God,

491
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.330
just go,
go on stub hub and get tickets.
Sit at the top of the stadium.

492
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.600
It'll still be way better than any seats you'll ever get at an NBA final or a

493
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.640
Stanley Cup final or anything for the money.

494
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.240
And you're not even going to be that far away and everybody has to be so fucking

495
00:29:47.241 --> 00:29:47.900
quiet.

496
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.370
You can actually hear him grunting and groaning like you sit in court side.
Um,

497
00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.000
and then the tennis court is just super fucking small.

498
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.533
<v 3>MMM.</v>

499
00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.390
<v 0>It really is one of the great,
you know,
if you're going to go to a championship,</v>

500
00:30:02.391 --> 00:30:06.050
things as far as like a sporting event that you can then you can go to was

501
00:30:06.051 --> 00:30:10.070
phenomenal.
And I absolutely,
uh,
you know,

502
00:30:10.071 --> 00:30:13.280
I've never seen tennis playing on clay before.
So that was totally cool.

503
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.500
And then I also remembered that fucking hilarious chapter in John Mcenroe's book

504
00:30:18.501 --> 00:30:22.340
where yeah,
he'd won Wimbleton,
he won the US Open,

505
00:30:22.341 --> 00:30:26.180
he won the Australian Open and he needed the career Grand Slam to win the French

506
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:31.100
Open.
And one year he actually hadn't won.
And he ended up fucking up any,
blew it.

507
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:35.750
And every time he goes there to commentate,
he thinks about it.
And,
um,

508
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.140
I told you that great thing that he said that when he was fucking up one year

509
00:30:39.141 --> 00:30:40.100
when he was fucking it up,

510
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.110
<v 3>okay.</v>

511
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.700
<v 0>He screamed at the top of his lungs.
I hate this country.
Um,</v>

512
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.210
which to me is one of the fucking great things every yelled out during a game.

513
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.520
And of course,
you know,
he got booed,

514
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:53.500
which probably made them play better in the next game,

515
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.810
which is why I love John Mcenroe.
So anyways,

516
00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:00.700
so that was my big sporting event thing that I did on this trip.
And uh,

517
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:05.390
now that it's fucking over,
um,
looking back,

518
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.550
I think I'm just going to have him,

519
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.833
<v 3>I dunno,</v>

520
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.630
<v 0>maybe more fun the next time I go to one.</v>

521
00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:17.240
And actually I still totally enjoyed it,
but I really got fucking annoyed

522
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.680
by them Bowen and when they showed any sort of emotion that wasn't gentlemanly

523
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:28.120
behavior,
I dunno that just fucking bug.
Maybe I'm an idiot.

524
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.960
I Dunno.
Anyways,
let's get Jesus Christ.

525
00:31:31.961 --> 00:31:35.350
I just rambled for 31 fucking minutes.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.230
I hate when they do this shit.
Uber is,
it is international.

565
00:33:59.231 --> 00:34:01.210
They have it here in France.
You're doing great.

566
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.600
They don't need to have me say that.
I take it,
I don't fucking take it.

567
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:05.620
I take cabs,

568
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.660
I take cabs because nobody who drives a cab knows who the fuck I am.
All right.

569
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.500
But those Uber guys,
you know,
they're always like,
yeah,
yeah,

570
00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:18.040
that guy from the thing and then you live here.
So I don't,

571
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.960
I like getting my friend.
I still take cabs not set,
but I love over,

572
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.610
oh,
I get jealous.
Whatever.

573
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:29.510
My wife fucking takes it cause it it fucking come stay awake quicker than a cab.

574
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.370
It's the fucking way to go.

575
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:33.163
<v 2>All right.</v>

576
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.820
<v 0>Unless you've been on,
I love the 80 [inaudible] then you got to,</v>

577
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.260
you got to weigh your options or maybe tell him you live on a different street

578
00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:42.330
and walk a block over.
All right?

579
00:34:42.331 --> 00:34:45.810
So of them have really interesting stories as to why they drive with Uber.

580
00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:50.220
What like cab drivers don't.
I used to be a doctor,
um,

581
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:55.080
in my country I was president.
Uh,
they love being their own boss.

582
00:34:55.081 --> 00:34:59.070
They earn great money.
It's easy to start.
You just need a car in a license.

583
00:34:59.071 --> 00:35:02.730
This is the part I love.
If I was,
uh,
you know,
I would,

584
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.020
I would definitely fucking do this.

585
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.490
I driving with Uber is great for anyone who needs flexibility,
mobility,
parents.

586
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.390
This is a really easy way to work around your family schedule students,

587
00:35:12.391 --> 00:35:14.670
you can make some extra money between classes.

588
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.940
Now's the prime time to cash and driving with Uber.

589
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.610
You'll thank me for telling you how to get paid every week.

590
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.450
I could be getting into your car when you drive with Uber.
Yeah,
I'm for my wife.

591
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.900
A call to action.
You got a car and a license.

592
00:35:27.901 --> 00:35:30.750
Put a both to work and start earning serious life changing money.

593
00:35:30.751 --> 00:35:33.660
Sign up with Uber.
Visit drive with uber.com.

594
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:38.520
That's drive with Uber U B E r.com with uber.com.

595
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.660
That is a fucking great way to make money.
You already got your car,

596
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.500
you making payments on it.
Why not make it fucking work for you.
There you go.

597
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.460
I totally understand it.
All right.
Dollar Shave club,
everybody.
All right.

598
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.250
People fed up who still had,

599
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:56.760
evidently I'm fed up who still hasn't joined dollar shave club.

600
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.790
There are some no,
I'm serious.

601
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:03.240
Their raises are amazing and it's more convenient and cost a fraction of the

602
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:07.380
price.
What's the issue?
Still don't get it.
Here's how the club works.

603
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:11.280
Go to dollar shave club.com and pick up one of the three great razors,

604
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.510
the two blade humble twin,
the four blade,
four x in this.

605
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.200
If you're a fucking Werewolf,
the six blade executive,

606
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.700
I guess that's what I use now.
I doubt,
uh,

607
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.740
you get your first box in about a week.

608
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:29.160
It includes a free handle in a sleeve of blade cartridges.

609
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.640
It's high quality stuff.
Got that weight to it.

610
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:37.620
Like the expensive ones I've used before.
Oh God,

611
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:40.890
this is making my teeth hurt.
My exec had six stainless.

612
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.170
I don't have a fucking exec.

613
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.310
I understand you sell it and I will help you fucking sell it and I understand.

614
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:51.370
It's great.
Stop saying I have it when I doubt.
All right.

615
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.650
Does the execs has six stainless steel blades in 90 degree pivot head and the

616
00:36:55.651 --> 00:37:00.540
aloes strip.
All right.
You'll never get a shave like this.
After that,

617
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.900
they tried to say,
I never got to shave like that.
I personally,

618
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:08.310
I think two blades is all you need.
One sucks.
Two is the perfect one.

619
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.180
Anytime you get three or more,
you even with my cute little button nose,

620
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:15.180
I've got a son adjust to my nose because it can't get fucking under there.

621
00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.150
All right,
you made me say that dollar shave club,

622
00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:20.610
they putting fucking words in my mouth.
All right.
After that,

623
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:25.410
they mail you for replacement blades every month or every other and you'll never

624
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:28.590
have to worry about it again.
That's it.
If you haven't joined,
you're missing out.

625
00:37:28.591 --> 00:37:32.540
Simple as that.
Try Dollar Shave club.com/bur bur.

626
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.560
That's dollar shave club.com/burr a father's day is around the corner and dollar

627
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.860
shave club makes a great,
great gift.
There you go.

628
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.800
I don't understand why they're to make me say I'm doing all this shit.

629
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.240
It's a fucking great product.
They totally rip you off at the drug store.

630
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.820
These fucking people got the same quality razors.

631
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.150
You sign up for this shit and they bring them to you in the,
and there you go.

632
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.630
You get,

633
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.220
you get that 20 minutes of your life back every fucking week or every month,

634
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:03.010
whatever the hell you did.
Why can't you just write copy like that?

635
00:38:03.011 --> 00:38:07.800
Why do you to sit there and say,
I have that shit.
I don't have that shit.
Oh God,

636
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:12.450
I'm going to cunty mood.
Huh?
All right.
Um,
all right.

637
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.770
Oh,
I saw this,
this fucking story.
It's really annoyed.
The shit out of me.

638
00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:20.430
Surprise,
surprise.
It said,
uh,

639
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.300
is this is this cute little fucking story and God knows the Internet either

640
00:38:24.301 --> 00:38:25.350
likes a,

641
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:30.180
we should burn this person at the stake story or this little cute s story.

642
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.040
Like,
you know,

643
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.640
I thought my life is over and then this kitten showed up and what happened next

644
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:40.960
will bring you tears of joy.
I've,
I refuse to,

645
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.020
this kittenish showed up.

646
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:49.380
I fucking refused to read any of those and I have never told any you guys,

647
00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:55.550
uh,
you know,
I just need you to just,
could you do me,
us?
Do me a favor,

648
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.240
please stop clicking on those.
You know what I mean?

649
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:03.050
I was sitting on a park bench in a wizard,

650
00:39:03.051 --> 00:39:07.580
walked up to me and what he had to say next will change your life.

651
00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.920
And then you get on there and it's,

652
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:13.910
it's like a quarter of the story and then you got to fucking figure out how to

653
00:39:13.911 --> 00:39:17.270
click.
It's just,
it's what does it click bait.
That's what they call it.
All right.

654
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.910
And I'll tell you,
I fucking was able to figure it out.

655
00:39:19.911 --> 00:39:22.730
After falling forward about 162 times,

656
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.610
I realized that all the stories sounded fake.

657
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:29.720
None of this shit was really inspiring.
I never cried.
I never laughed.

658
00:39:29.721 --> 00:39:33.750
I just got fucking annoyed and I had a bunch of pop up ads.
So,
um,

659
00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.230
I just,
I dunno,
you don't have to deal,
could continue to click on it.

660
00:39:39.231 --> 00:39:40.610
Pull the fuck am I to tell you what to do.

661
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.360
But I always laugh when I read those now and you wouldn't believe what happens

662
00:39:44.361 --> 00:39:44.860
next.

663
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.200
You won't believe what happens next is I scroll onto the next fucking story,

664
00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:52.370
a Douche.
Um,
by the way,
I love Facebook.

665
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:55.550
I absolutely love it.
And don't give a fuck if it makes me sound like an old man.

666
00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:59.270
I am an old man and I like how they have all these interesting stories picked

667
00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:03.380
out for me by some of the Douche on Facebook rather than having to try and find

668
00:40:03.381 --> 00:40:06.200
them myself.
So anyway,
so,
um,

669
00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:07.530
<v 2>okay.</v>

670
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:12.530
<v 0>Scrolling through the Facebook as US older people say and um,</v>

671
00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.790
there was just supposed to be this cute,
heartwarming fucking story.

672
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.560
It was about how people were delayed for six hours.

673
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:24.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

674
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:25.930
<v 0>In the airport,</v>

675
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.370
but through some unbelievable miracle,

676
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.840
the cast of the lion king and Aladdin was there at the airport.

677
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:39.070
Right.
And they're acting like this is some fucking amazing thing.
It's like,
no,

678
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:43.210
this is the cast of the traveling fucking show.
This is what these people do.

679
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.670
Cause after it's a hit on Broadway,

680
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.260
the people then want to make money and take it around the country for people who

681
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:51.930
don't have time,
the money.

682
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:53.410
<v 2>Okay.</v>

683
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.290
<v 0>Or whatever to fucking go to New York.</v>

684
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.410
No country can't go to New York and squeeze it to that theater.

685
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:03.100
So they have a couple of traveling shows.
So Lo and behold,

686
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:07.060
you imagine this,
you're at the fucking airport.

687
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.900
Your flight is delayed six hours.
And then for some reason,

688
00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:14.650
the fact that the cast of the lion king and Aladdin is there,

689
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:20.230
like this was supposed to be heartwarming,
that it made it like a better thing.

690
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:22.460
<v 2>Okay,</v>

691
00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.540
<v 0>this is what happened.
They started singing the fucking songs</v>

692
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.440
to a Latin or the lion king.

693
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.170
Just imagine you're sitting there stuck in a fucking,

694
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.360
and then all of a sudden some dude starts doing this.

695
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.010
Oh my God,
will you shut the,

696
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.750
<v 4>would you guys shut the fuck up?</v>

697
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:58.560
Shut the fuck up.

698
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.870
<v 0>Right?
Isn't that what you would say?</v>

699
00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:10.410
The last fucking thing I would need is I'm sitting there hating my fucking life

700
00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:11.750
is somebody go,

701
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.583
<v 4>wow,</v>

702
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.170
<v 3>okay.</v>

703
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:23.920
<v 0>You ever think that most people fucking hate Broadway shows?</v>

704
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:25.603
<v 3>All right.</v>

705
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.520
<v 0>I,
I don't,
you know,
there's a very,</v>

706
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:33.210
there's very few people that actually enjoy Broadway shows.
Okay.
It's children.

707
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.460
It's the gay community.

708
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.263
<v 3>MMM.</v>

709
00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.070
<v 0>Oh my God,
I can't say the next group because then I'll just get them.</v>

710
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.080
I'm just picturing,
you know,
and then,
I don't know.

711
00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.140
I don't,
I don't know.
It's fucking people or old people,

712
00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:58.120
you know what I mean?
Who went to,
who went to funny girl in Oklahoma?

713
00:42:58.121 --> 00:43:01.800
And they actually,
you know,
when movies back in the day when they're dead be,

714
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:05.200
you'll be watching a movie and all of a sudden the middle,
you have the dialogue.

715
00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:07.840
They would just break out and do a song and they would start dancing.

716
00:43:07.841 --> 00:43:12.040
It's like leftover Vaudevillian horse shit.
And,
uh,
you know,

717
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:16.300
this is like a kid's movie that you've turned into a fucking musical.

718
00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:20.680
So it sucks on two levels.
Now you've married two fucking things.

719
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.610
All right?
Very,
very rarely is a kid's movie like,
like a toy story is great.

720
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:26.223
<v 3>All right.</v>

721
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.640
<v 0>But I gotta be honest with you,
the whole fucking,
you know,</v>

722
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.600
like pretty much the rest of them,
like bugs bunny is funny.

723
00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.573
<v 3>You know what I mean?</v>

724
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.290
<v 0>Pinky and the brain.
It's funny.
Spongebob squarepants is fine.</v>

725
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:44.160
Sesame street is funny because they'd throw in jokes for adults,

726
00:43:44.161 --> 00:43:49.020
but a lot of them,
you know what I mean?
The care bears the fucking,
uh,

727
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.290
at a Munchie g or whatever the other ones are.
And then it's like munch Chichi.

728
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.690
Remember that?
Mon Chichi Munchie G.
Oh,
so soft and cuddly.
Mon Chichi.

729
00:43:57.691 --> 00:44:00.690
Munchie G it's a creepy monkey.
Right?

730
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.510
They would turn that into a fucking musical.

731
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.260
<v 3>Okay.</v>

732
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.220
<v 0>And then your girlfriend or your gay uncle or Yo,
you're fucking,</v>

733
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:13.120
you know the person who was in the sugar salt fucking problem.
Right?

734
00:44:13.121 --> 00:44:16.060
Some fatty will take you to the God damn thing and he got to sit there.

735
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.630
All right.
But at least you're prepared for it.
When you go to a Broadway show,

736
00:44:19.631 --> 00:44:24.520
the last fucking thing you need a,
I mean is,
oh my God.

737
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:30.160
And the only thing worse than those fucking people singing that horse shit would

738
00:44:30.161 --> 00:44:34.140
be the people standing around enjoying it.

739
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.820
The looks on their faces.
Oh my God.
Can you believe it?

740
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:41.250
They sang and luck angels.
Right.

741
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:43.570
<v 3>Okay.</v>

742
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.870
<v 0>They're not the first fucking horrible,
the whole fucking thing is horrible.</v>

743
00:44:46.871 --> 00:44:49.750
And it was probably written by some white dude in somewhere in Africa.

744
00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:51.860
It's probably really offensive that

745
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.083
<v 4>wow</v>

746
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.650
<v 0>fucking talk and lines and all that shit and turn into place into this magical</v>

747
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:01.550
mystery tour.
Right?
The same way when Aladdin came out,

748
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.030
people from the Middle East,
hey to dead horse shit as we ate it up.
Oh my God.

749
00:45:06.031 --> 00:45:09.780
Robin Williams rest his soul was fucking hilarious.
Is the Latin right?

750
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.540
As if flying on carpets coming out of tea kettles,

751
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.900
they didn't like that shitty that they didn't like 300.

752
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:17.610
They didn't like any of that fucking horse shit.

753
00:45:17.611 --> 00:45:20.190
Now you've got these kinds of singing at the airport for the love of God.

754
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.460
They should have made them go walk into that little fish tank where they make

755
00:45:23.461 --> 00:45:26.790
smokers go to go fucking sing in there.
Alright.

756
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.270
Jesus Christ.
I'm in a fucking goofy.
What'd you,
what'd you know?

757
00:45:30.271 --> 00:45:33.870
I'm on vacation right now and am gay,
Patti.
Um,

758
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:40.230
I hate that shit.
I gotta be honest with you.
I'm a bit of the Grinch.

759
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:41.783
<v 3>MMM.</v>

760
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.520
<v 0>I have major issues with a heartwarming stories.</v>

761
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.120
They never make me emotional.

762
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.050
They make me fucking angry like that singing there made me fucking angry.

763
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.210
<v 3>But,
uh,</v>

764
00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.970
<v 0>I'll tell you the things that make me actually get like emotional,</v>

765
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.970
where I almost started tearing up is,

766
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.153
<v 3>uh,</v>

767
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:11.470
<v 0>what I watched kids fighting on youtube and I'll see the kid,</v>

768
00:46:12.141 --> 00:46:16.270
that shit a lost all of a sudden flip out and beat the kid that,

769
00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:20.010
that should have beat him.
That actually will make me emotional.
Now,

770
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:21.650
I don't know what that says about me,

771
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:26.450
<v 3>but um,
you know,
I dunno,</v>

772
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.780
<v 0>whatever it,
maybe that's just not for me.
Oh my God.</v>

773
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:33.040
I've been into so many,

774
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:36.190
so many fucking airports and there's so much shit to annoy you.

775
00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:41.220
The last thing you need and out of all the fucking songs to break into,

776
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.610
you break into that fucking

777
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.730
that whatever the fuck that is like that helium balloon.
What does,

778
00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:52.730
what does that shit?
People you suck on like helium.

779
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.730
I mean that's like,
that was what was just happening.

780
00:46:57.731 --> 00:47:02.731
There was like 40 Yoko Ono's all at the same time in harmony singing some horror

781
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:05.560
like that.

782
00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.393
<v 4>No.</v>

783
00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:11.290
<v 0>Some shit that yoga would have screamed out while the Beatles were playing,</v>

784
00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:13.240
thinking that she was adding to the music.

785
00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.133
<v 3>All right.</v>

786
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.000
<v 0>I might get some complaints over that one.
You know,</v>

787
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.480
people like,
you know,
I always feel like

788
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.250
there's something sad about people who go to Broadway shows.

789
00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.010
That's not even true because what's his face?

790
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.100
The South Park guys did like the greatest one ever that I would have gone to,

791
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:38.080
but you know,
they was sold out for like nine years and at that point I just go,

792
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.160
I don't want to do this.

793
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.113
<v 2>You know what I mean?</v>

794
00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:46.950
<v 0>Are you guys like me?
Like I just like,
if there's a line,
I just,
I just say,
well,</v>

795
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:51.300
you know,
evidently I'm not going to have that experience.
That's how I just,

796
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:55.470
I don't feel like there's ever a reason to stand in a fucking line unless you

797
00:47:55.471 --> 00:47:59.210
were in a,
in a,
in a,
you know,
a labor camp.

798
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.570
Okay.
And the,
and the handed up slop,

799
00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.003
<v 2>right.</v>

800
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.420
<v 0>That was Kim who I'll stand in line to go see a fucking,</v>

801
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:12.410
a good showing a rock star or something like that.
But like if,

802
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.150
if there's like a fucking

803
00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:16.270
<v 2>okay.</v>

804
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:20.970
<v 0>You see how he just suddenly covered myself there.
If I fucking,</v>

805
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.900
I got to clarify this,
like,

806
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.760
<v 2>okay.</v>

807
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.520
<v 0>If they go,
oh my God,
this place has the best fucking burgers and I show up in,</v>

808
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:32.480
there's a line around the block.
I just go,
well,

809
00:48:32.481 --> 00:48:33.710
I guess I'm never going to have one.

810
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.120
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

811
00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.340
<v 0>that,
fuck.
What are we,
what are we in?</v>

812
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:40.290
Russia was standing a fucking bread line here.
I'm not doing that.
Okay.

813
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.090
Why don't you fucking assholes.

814
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.790
Get a bigger space and add some more fucking tables.

815
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.223
<v 2>Right.</v>

816
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:51.420
<v 0>Is that Ron did this whole thing just go off the fucking rails.
I don't even,</v>

817
00:48:51.421 --> 00:48:56.350
I don't even know.
All right,
let's get to some questions here for the week.
Um,

818
00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.651
did I get through everything?

819
00:48:57.651 --> 00:49:00.320
All I know is I'm really excited to get home and I'm home for like four days and

820
00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:02.160
I go back out on tour and uh,

821
00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:06.830
I am so Jones and to do fucking stand up,
um,

822
00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:07.880
<v 2>okay.</v>

823
00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.110
<v 0>I,</v>

824
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:13.110
I got this fucking Ms. Bruce Jenner idea that I want to do that has nothing.

825
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:15.760
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

826
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.191
<v 0>Actually,</v>

827
00:49:16.191 --> 00:49:19.640
I'm not making fun of what he did and what he did actually make me feel,

828
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.730
considering his accomplishments made me feel like less of a man.

829
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:28.300
So that's going to be my angle on the whole thing.
All right,

830
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.780
here we go.
Raging bull.
Dear Billy,
the raging bull.

831
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.160
Uh,
I don't know what that means.
Bullshit.

832
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.050
Or maybe I was once a financial banker.
Yes.

833
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.590
One of those rotten scoundrels at where a monkey suit and work like a tool

834
00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:44.600
alongside other corporate douche bags.

835
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:48.230
It took me a few years to actually see how shitty this industry really was

836
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.130
filled with Douchey.
Constant would do anything to get ahead.
I fucking hated it.

837
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:53.510
One day a work colleague,

838
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.830
colleague asked me to help him train for one of those white collar charity

839
00:49:57.831 --> 00:49:59.750
boxing events.
It basic,

840
00:49:59.751 --> 00:50:03.710
it's basically an event when a regular corporate dude laces up a pair of gloves.

841
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:06.120
Oh,
corporate dudes.
I've seen that.

842
00:50:06.121 --> 00:50:08.360
And they fight each other and they have to go out in a boxing ring.

843
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:13.250
All the raised money for some cutthroat charity.
I know,
right?
Um,

844
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:14.811
oh,
by the way,

845
00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:18.830
somebody gave me shit for reading that thing about the Red Cross going there,

846
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
there's a great organization and you totally classified them as being pieces of

847
00:50:24.801 --> 00:50:28.400
shit just because of one bad.
And it's like,
no,
I didn't.

848
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.290
I actually said that,

849
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:32.780
I don't know if part of this is because of what's going on down in Haiti,

850
00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:36.290
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And as I did that,
I remembered like,
wait a minute,

851
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:41.360
didn't they get shit for uh,
what they did during nine 11.

852
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.960
So actually wrote the guide Blatt back.
I was like,
no,
no,
I didn't.

853
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.830
I didn't trash it.
But by the way,
here's another article.
All right,

854
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:52.010
with your precious Red Cross.
Um,
anyways,
I,

855
00:50:52.011 --> 00:50:56.120
he said I've been competing since I was in college and it was more of a hobby

856
00:50:56.121 --> 00:50:59.660
than anything else.
So I agreed to help my coworker with some of his training.

857
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.320
After arriving at my coworkers boxing gym and watching some of the other

858
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:05.540
corporate monkeys hit the heavy bag and spar,

859
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.140
I really wanted to enter myself into this event.
Ah,
dude,

860
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:12.100
you're a real fucking ring.
Uh,

861
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.100
he said these corporate noodles couldn't punch themselves out of a wet paper
bag.

862
00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:19.880
And I thought how satisfying it would be to beat the living shit out of one of

863
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:24.470
these aspiring douchey banker cunts.
A dude,
come on man,
you can't do that.

864
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.760
Um,
although it would be kind of funny.
It body shuts funny.

865
00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:31.550
He can't hit him in the head.
Anyways,
he said,

866
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:33.560
I went over the idea with my boxing coach.

867
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:37.640
He really didn't approve of the notion of a trained fighter ripping up some

868
00:51:37.641 --> 00:51:42.260
regular Joe smoke.
Exactly.
He goes,
so unfortunately I didn't enter the event.

869
00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:42.801
To this day.

870
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:46.280
I still regret not having the chance to trash one of those corporate douche is

871
00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:48.770
in the ring.
It would have felt so sweet.
Right.

872
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:52.160
Question to you is if you had some sort of formal training and comp,

873
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.690
a combat sport and there was a chance for you to enter a celebrity boxing event,

874
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:01.970
uh,
would you love to,
who would you love to fight?
It could be another comedian,

875
00:52:01.971 --> 00:52:03.310
celebrity sports figure.

876
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.320
Anyone who would be across the ring from you to pummel a longterm update.

877
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:12.110
I have since left that soul sucking corporate gig to pursue a year of world

878
00:52:12.111 --> 00:52:16.660
travel yet with the blood money and competition of boxing.

879
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:19.210
I'm just fucking with you too.
God bless you.
Have a good time.
Uh,

880
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.470
seeing you live in Toronto,
Pittsburgh in Brisbane,
Australia,
uh,

881
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:27.260
keep kicking ass bill.
Um,
all right.

882
00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:29.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

883
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.870
<v 0>All right.
If I was formally trained in combat,</v>

884
00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.950
like there's no way I would fight someone else unless they were formally trained

885
00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:40.000
or if they were trying to hurt me.
Come on.
You can't fucking do that.

886
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:43.840
But I'm saying as how I'm not formally trained,

887
00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:51.360
who would I want to fight and I get to win the toughest fucking guy out there.

888
00:52:51.371 --> 00:52:54.190
So I look like a stud.
Um,

889
00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.410
there's really nobody I want to beat the shit out of.

890
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:58.833
<v 2>Is there,</v>

891
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.640
<v 0>I fight the cast of a Latin?
Nah,</v>

892
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.760
I wouldn't do that.
That's just a loose,
loose,

893
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:12.240
either you'd beat up a bunch of fucking Broadway singers or worse,

894
00:53:12.241 --> 00:53:15.000
you lose to them.
Um,

895
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.180
<v 2>okay.</v>

896
00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.040
<v 0>I'll tell you,
I,
let me tell you who I wouldn't fight.
Uh,</v>

897
00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:23.970
I wouldn't fight Joe Rogan.
There's a long list of people that I wouldn't fight,

898
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:26.760
uh,

899
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:29.780
<v 1>Mark Wahlberg.
I wouldn't fight him.</v>

900
00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:31.683
<v 3>MMM.</v>

901
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.901
<v 1>You know,
I love to,</v>

902
00:53:32.901 --> 00:53:35.810
was all the people listening right now going to write fucking kid dead guys.

903
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.280
This what'd you,
what'd Ya,
I don't think you would.
Um,

904
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.430
who else?
Ving Rhames I wouldn't fight.
Ving Rhames you know what it is?

905
00:53:46.431 --> 00:53:47.390
It's the people that,

906
00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:52.240
that like either in shape or they just have a certain fucking vibe about them.

907
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:56.390
Were you just like,
yeah,
it would fuck with that guy.
Uh,
there's a lot of people,

908
00:53:56.391 --> 00:54:00.530
I wouldn't fight 247 next weekend.
Most of Hollywood.

909
00:54:00.531 --> 00:54:04.470
I wouldn't fight most of Hollywood.
I would fucking lose too.
Uh,

910
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.610
I,
I,
you know,
I throw a fucking little girly jab and I would,
I would,

911
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:13.760
I would hang on in the crowd,
would boo like,
you know,

912
00:54:13.761 --> 00:54:15.320
when you get ripped off at a pay per view,

913
00:54:15.321 --> 00:54:19.760
like that's what my flight would look like.
Um,
no,
I was kidding who.

914
00:54:19.761 --> 00:54:23.440
I get her a couple times and then I would start spasming out and I'd fucking

915
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:27.290
just start doing the windmill punches before the person just sat in the pocket

916
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:30.230
and caught me with a good fucking,
I dunno,

917
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.740
left Hook and just drop me.
Sit right on the seat of my pants.
Make weird noises.

918
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:42.050
All right.
Uh,
girlfriend,
a whore.
Hey Nia.

919
00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:45.690
That's probably still sleeping.
All right.

920
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.530
I like to have her for these fucking things.
All right,
girlfriend.

921
00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:53.080
A whore in my walk of shame.

922
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.980
Hey Bill on 22 years old and I've been dating a lady for a few months now.

923
00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:03.850
Thanks in.
Been going great.
We click,
we clicked really well and she's beautiful.

924
00:55:03.851 --> 00:55:08.050
This is a funny,
all of these starts this way.
Everything's she,
she's beautiful.

925
00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:10.530
<v 2>Okay.</v>

926
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:15.180
<v 1>It says in elegant girls,
I think you meant to say it's all one word.</v>

927
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.380
I n e l.
E.

928
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:23.640
T inelegant and elegant girl.
I Dunno.

929
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.470
With a a great job.
Things were going great until recently.

930
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:32.640
She still lives at home and one night she asked me to come over for a late night

931
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:37.590
booty call.
Oh,
Jesus.
What's wrong with that dude?
Just girls a champ so far.

932
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:42.150
Of course I show up to a parent's house and get into bed with her.
Oh,

933
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:46.230
she lived at home with their parents.
Okay.
It's kind of weird.
As I laid down,

934
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:51.390
as I laid down,
I sat on a vibrating sex toy.

935
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:54.660
She was embarrassed and played it off like,
oh,

936
00:55:54.661 --> 00:55:57.870
I just found this recently when I was cleaning through my stuff,

937
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.250
I acted like I didn't care.
But in my head I was screaming,
what the fuck,

938
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:08.280
dude,
why are you acting like you didn't fucking rub one out like the day before?

939
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:13.380
Yeah,
but I use my hand.
I went all natural.
What are you looking at her like?

940
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:16.730
She's a fuck.
She's using p days here.
Um,
anyways,

941
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:21.390
we go at it and I spend the night at her place.
I love how you were like,

942
00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:21.931
what the fuck?

943
00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:25.790
But you still banged her classic guy moved to this chick's a fucking psycho.

944
00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:30.170
One of fuck.
Okay.
In the morning.

945
00:56:30.171 --> 00:56:34.010
It turns out she wasn't home alone.
Her Dad was home.

946
00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:38.420
And when I do the walk of shame and I do the walk of shame out of the House,

947
00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:38.871
Oh my God,

948
00:56:38.871 --> 00:56:43.871
the Dad's side saw you o m g on top of this weight on top of it.

949
00:56:45.801 --> 00:56:48.770
This was the first time meeting her dad.

950
00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.980
We didn't say a word to each other and he just gave me this death glare that

951
00:56:52.981 --> 00:56:56.390
screened this motherfucker.
Just Bang my daughter in my house.

952
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.553
Oh my God.

953
00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:04.370
Her Dad flipped his shit on her and once in a move out she asked me if it's cool

954
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:09.780
if she lives with the two guys from work.
I tell her I don't care.
But again,

955
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:12.990
I'm thinking,
uh,

956
00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.320
what in the actual fuck is going on here basically.

957
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:20.280
How do you think I should play this out?
Should I cut my losses and get out?

958
00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:24.060
I tried to stick it out.
I feel like those are some serious red flags,

959
00:57:24.061 --> 00:57:27.510
but I really liked this girl and until this point,
things were perfect.

960
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:32.150
Maybe the lovely Nia could help.
Yeah,
she needs to help.
I would say this.
Um,

961
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.170
uh,
yeah,
she could have been a little,

962
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:42.700
she could have handled that situation a little better.
Uh,

963
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.810
with her dad.
Uh,
Christ,
I don't think knee is up,
so

964
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:51.490
what do I do?
Do I disappoint you guys are dilemma.

965
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:53.650
Do I let my wife sleep on the vacation?

966
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:57.850
Let's go wake up my wife.
Hang on.

967
00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:00.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

968
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.420
<v 1>Bull Zuma.
Dom Nia,</v>

969
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:11.380
can you help me out with a question here?
Are you still sleeping?

970
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:13.883
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

971
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:16.940
<v 1>All right.
I'll give it to you real quick.</v>

972

973
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.930
<v 1>All right.
Here's the deal.
This kid's 22 weeks with this girl.</v>

974
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:27.270
She's fucking perfect.
Everything's wonder,

Everything's wonderful.

975
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:30.390
<v 2>All right.
Uh,</v>

976
00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:33.820
<v 1>so she calls him up one night for booty call.
He goes over there.</v>

977
00:58:33.821 --> 00:58:37.390
She's still living at home.
Is that hard of parents are at home?

978
00:58:37.391 --> 00:58:38.650
So he goes up there.
He goes like,

979
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.680
I get into the bed and me that we sit on one of the vibrating sex toys and he's,

980
00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:46.450
she tries to play it off like,
oh,

981
00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:51.451
that's just something I found what I was going through my stuff and he said he

982
00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:56.320
was,
he played it off.
I was like,
what the fuck?
He thought it was weird.
He's 22,

983
00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:59.680
so she fucking,
they bang,

984
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.440
he wakes up the next morning and it turns out her fucking dad is home,

985
00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.340
so he's got to do the walk of shame right past her dad.

986
00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.593
<v 2>Oh.</v>

987
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:13.470
<v 1>And the guy is just glaring at him.</v>

988
00:59:13.471 --> 00:59:17.370
Like if you just fucked my daughter in my own house,
get the fuck out of here.

989
00:59:17.371 --> 00:59:22.210
So he gets the fuck out of there.
Right.
And then,
uh,
like

990
00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:25.360
<v 0>the next day at work or something,
she goes,
yeah,
my dad's pissed at me.</v>

991
00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:29.470
He wants me to move out.
Do you mind if I move in with two guys from work?

992
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.720
And he's like,
part of them,
you know,
likes the girl.
And the other part is like,

993
00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:36.970
you know,
there,
there are too many red flags here.

994
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:46.220
<v 1>What's red flag about it?
Uh,
that I dunno.</v>

995
00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:50.900
They
do.
She got to turn towards the mic.

996
00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:55.890
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Shit.

997
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:01.550
Yeah.
Sorry,
I had the fucking recorder.
Yeah.
Um,

998
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:06.640
what's red flag about it?
Well,
first of all,
it's white girlfriend.

999
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:11.850
She's just said booty call earlier.
Right.
So if you're talking about boutique,

1000
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.170
it's,
it's the beginning of a relationship here.
And he's like,
do I pursue this?

1001
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.580
I want to ask her why she thought it was necessary to ask him permission about

1002
01:00:19.581 --> 01:00:23.480
where she wants to live.
Right.

1003
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.520
But obviously that's not the situation here.

1004
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.670
Move in with two guys that they work with.
And I mean,

1005
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.550
and that's a little fucking,
well,
what if,
okay,
let's flip the tables.

1006
01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:36.130
You and I just started looking up.
Hey,

1007
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.370
is it okay if I move in with these two chicks and we both work with,
oh,

1008
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:44.900
they all work together.
Yup.
What am I fucking Jack tripper.

1009
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:48.340
You're not gonna have a problem with that.
Boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop,
boop.

1010
01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.310
<v 0>I think you,
I think kids these days,</v>

1011
01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.690
<v 5>they,
uh,
they lived together,
males and females,</v>

1012
01:00:55.691 --> 01:00:58.800
and it's not like a big deal.
So,
um,

1013
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:03.820
now if I were her,
if I were like her mom,
I think it'd be a different story.
But,

1014
01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:08.530
um,
no,
I,
I don't understand.
Well,

1015
01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:12.460
because I had,
you know,
because I would just be like a mom about it,
you know?

1016
01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:15.910
But as,
as a guy who was just a hanging out with her.

1017
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:17.521
<v 0>Yeah,
but you just,</v>

1018
01:01:17.521 --> 01:01:22.521
she just fucking banged you when her dad was home and then made you just fucking

1019
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.710
doesn't even have the decency to be like,
Hey,
my dad's home,

1020
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.070
you might want to go out the fucking window and you walk by the dead.

1021
01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.040
Like he's like that.
He's done like what's,

1022
01:01:32.041 --> 01:01:35.070
what's he going to do having a relationship come over for fucking thanksgiving?

1023
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.620
Like his first fucking meeting is yet.
Yeah.

1024
01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.730
I fucking just railed your daughter right up above you.
Like if

1025
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:45.620
<v 5>he was,
if he was mature at all,
he would have been like,
oh good morning.
You know,</v>

1026
01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:49.050
my name is so and so and I just fucked your daughter.

1027
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.840
Well obviously you don't say that,
but what the fuck?

1028
01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:55.440
What are we reading all night?
No,
you say hi,
you know,

1029
01:01:55.441 --> 01:01:58.140
I'm friends with such and such and how are you,
you know,

1030
01:01:58.141 --> 01:01:59.170
you do the respect thing.

1031
01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.510
The respecting was to not say a fucking word to sit there and come down and be

1032
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.250
like,
hello,
how are you in?

1033
01:02:05.251 --> 01:02:09.840
And try to play it off like you didn't fuck is insulting that man's
intelligence.

1034
01:02:10.110 --> 01:02:13.470
Well,
it again anyway,
getting back to the,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Let's,
let's,

1035
01:02:13.471 --> 01:02:15.240
let's stay with that point there.
Okay.

1036
01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.420
There's no way out of that situation other than,
than what he did.

1037
01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:22.380
The most thing that he could have done was not saying anything because he's at

1038
01:02:22.381 --> 01:02:27.381
least as a man addressing the fact that he understands that what the fuck he

1039
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:30.330
did,
even though it wasn't on purpose,

1040
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:35.220
was ridiculously kind of fuck with this guy's head.

1041
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:36.450
I disagree.

1042
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:41.510
I think we should have done is been respectful and said,

1043
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:46.110
and like he saw him like you walked by his dad.
Yeah,
he was,
yeah.

1044
01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:50.000
He walked by and the guy in the guy's staring fucking daggers at.
Yeah.

1045
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:55.050
They didn't fucking 22 years old.
Oh,
I'm just,
I'm just saying,

1046
01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:59.970
I think it would have been better if he had a introduced himself because that's,

1047
01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:04.290
can you please do that to me?
I'll play this ad.
I'll respectable thing to do.

1048
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:07.370
I'll play the deck.
You don't just walk through somebody like,
uh,

1049
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.080
a grown person's house and not say anything.

1050
01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:14.100
That's something my parents would have about like,
you know,

1051
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:16.470
you don't just walk in my house and the,
you know what I mean?

1052
01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:18.790
Like almost saying what you're saying it,
but it has to,

1053
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:22.680
it can't be more than two words.
Like I would have just looked at him.

1054
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.290
I would have been,
I'm sorry,

1055
01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.740
but here's how we're talking about the red flag situation,
right?

1056
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.270
The red flag is that he's,
he's,

1057
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.300
this girl is sexual and so that to him as a red flag and you know what baby

1058
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:44.670
doll,
you need to fucking get over it.

1059
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.990
You know something.
I understand where you're going with this,

1060
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:53.210
where it's just like,
if a guy's is just like you do,
all right.

1061
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:56.280
Maybe she wasn't smart about putting away her vibrators.

1062
01:03:56.281 --> 01:04:00.150
Maybe she was thinking that you might be kind of like,
oh,
what is this?

1063
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:01.081
But you know,

1064
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:05.850
you're 22 you probably don't know how to use it or don't quite understand what

1065
01:04:05.851 --> 01:04:07.860
it's about.
He's 22 he doesn't need it.

1066
01:04:07.861 --> 01:04:11.120
It's Dick is standing at attention when he fucking wakes up in the morning for

1067
01:04:11.121 --> 01:04:15.540
him.
I don't mean for him.
I meant for like they could,

1068
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.990
he could use it on her.
Like that's what I meant the fuck.

1069
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:24.270
Do you think I meant you said he doesn't need it as if I'm saying that she
would,

1070
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:28.000
you know what I'm saying?
Like he doesn't need it to pleasure her.
Jesus Christ.

1071
01:04:28.001 --> 01:04:32.400
Let me,
there's from what I was saying,
okay,

1072
01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:36.990
but there's other,
there's other ways that 22,
I know,
Bill,

1073
01:04:36.991 --> 01:04:39.120
I'm saying that that's fucking,

1074
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.080
you can have like a nice strong dick that goes all night,

1075
01:04:43.081 --> 01:04:46.230
but you can also use a vibrator as well.
Like,
you know this,

1076
01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:51.060
don't make me explain this to you.
You know what I'm talking about.
I do.
Okay.

1077
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.300
All right.
Thank you for giving me credit.
Um,

1078
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:59.870
listen to you.
I don't have a,
I agree with,
you know,

1079
01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.240
whatever.
All right.
He's,
he's not ready for it.
It's fine.

1080
01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.980
The point is that he,
it's fine.

1081
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.750
Maybe one day he will be.
Um,
but the fact that it's seeds us was like,
oh my God,

1082
01:05:12.751 --> 01:05:17.310
this is a sexual girl and she doesn't really give a fuck who knows it.
Right.

1083
01:05:17.311 --> 01:05:18.090
Whether it's me who

1084
01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:20.490
<v 1>came over for a booty call because I'm like,
Whoa,</v>

1085
01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:25.700
what's this vibrator doing here?
Or you know,
her dad.
So she was,

1086
01:05:25.701 --> 01:05:28.900
you took it now?
No,
I'm just trying to think how you miss took that.

1087
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:31.220
Like when I said his dick stands up when he wakes up,

1088
01:05:31.221 --> 01:05:34.590
like he needs to use her vibration because dick go up like,

1089
01:05:34.591 --> 01:05:38.740
and it doesn't even make any sense to me.
I,
I didn't think it made sense either,

1090
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:43.140
but it was obviously,
yeah,
I was looking at it like it was like the stunt Dick.

1091
01:05:43.141 --> 01:05:47.370
Like that's what like when you know those old guys in the steak houses who have

1092
01:05:47.371 --> 01:05:49.080
like the fucking chicks half their age,

1093
01:05:49.081 --> 01:05:54.081
like they show up with like a bag of like fucking Viagra and like the vibrator

1094
01:05:55.321 --> 01:05:59.340
because you know,
to keep her interested as they're waiting for the blue pill.

1095
01:05:59.341 --> 01:06:02.490
That to kick in.
That's how I was looking at it.

1096
01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.960
Jesus Christ as fucking clarify this shit.
So anyways,
my,

1097
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.640
my thing is Sonya is,

1098
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.843
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1099
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.880
<v 1>like just the situation that she put herself in and put him in where he then has</v>

1100
01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:17.810
to walk by the dad.

1101
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:21.600
I mean the whole fucking thing is just taken on water right now.
No,

1102
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:26.480
it's this very messy.
It's,
it's,
it's a very messy situation for sure.

1103
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.120
So there might be a lack of maturity on her side.

1104
01:06:29.121 --> 01:06:31.400
The wish these ready to like man,
if they're,
yeah,

1105
01:06:31.401 --> 01:06:34.510
they're both 22 I think that goes without saying,
but yes.
Okay.

1106
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.920
Just won't give them this girl any sort of criticism here and yet,
listen,
I said,

1107
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:41.630
I just said they're both,
they're both 42 we've already,

1108
01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.100
she's already shit all over this guy.

1109
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:45.800
I'm just saying like how am I shitting all over the guy?

1110
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:51.470
I'm just saying it's too early to get involved in this fucking argument.
Let's,

1111
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:54.350
let's just,
let's just plow ahead.
Let's just plow ahead here.

1112
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:59.410
What is the point that you are trying to get me to address here is that is maybe

1113
01:06:59.481 --> 01:07:01.040
she's not ready to be in a fucking,

1114
01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:06.020
she just got kicked out of our house for fucking another guy in the house.

1115
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.550
Yeah.
Okay.
That's,
you know,
that's not a very stable situation.
Again,
involved in,

1116
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.720
first of all,
you're 22 years old so you're still picking in the first round.

1117
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:18.530
It's not like the guy's 42 when he's single and he's going to take what's out

1118
01:07:18.531 --> 01:07:21.730
there.
There's a whole bunch of fucking,
you know this,
this is,

1119
01:07:21.731 --> 01:07:24.830
this is like you hit the NBA draft lottery.

1120
01:07:24.831 --> 01:07:27.320
You get like the first fucking pick in the draft here.

1121
01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:32.530
You're going to go with the fucking a woman who just got kicked out of our house

1122
01:07:32.901 --> 01:07:36.110
for fucking you while her dad was still home.

1123
01:07:36.111 --> 01:07:40.160
When you walked by Your Dad.
All the vibrators,
shit in anything out.

1124
01:07:40.161 --> 01:07:43.190
Who gives a fuck about all of that?
The fuck that part there.

1125
01:07:43.191 --> 01:07:47.660
I'm saying does he really need to hitch his wagon to that?

1126
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.760
So he's asking if he should like pursue a relationship because we're really

1127
01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:53.663
cause everything else,

1128
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.310
everything else other than her fucking two doors down from the dad and then

1129
01:07:58.311 --> 01:08:03.000
having him walk by the dad.
I mean,
there are some things in the,

1130
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:07.010
that right in the beginning,
despite of how nice you are and everything,

1131
01:08:07.011 --> 01:08:11.200
there are some things that make you kind of go like,
Hey,
you know what?
You know,

1132
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:15.900
relationships are hard either when you're with the right,
you know?

1133
01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:16.763
Geez.

1134
01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.013

I know you're the professional comedian than relationship.
Why am I here then?

1140
01:08:40.291 --> 01:08:42.960
You know?
No,
you were trashing the guy so bad.

1141
01:08:42.961 --> 01:08:47.310
I thought that that was another part of the trashing who we're just not a,

1142
01:08:47.311 --> 01:08:51.840
we're not,

she's the girl for you.

1144
01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.793
<v 1>How about that?</v>

1145
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.520
<v 0>There we go.
That's that.
That was a sofa.
Hey,
I did that whole thing to leave out.</v>

1146
01:09:03.521 --> 01:09:06.350
Why?
I don't think so.
Yeah,
I know why.
Cause he's,

1147
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:10.160
he cause cause he's not mature enough to handle a fucking blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1148
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.460
You there?
Obviously they're both of them.
If you are,

1149
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:15.680
don't you know I like about me walking away.

1150
01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:19.470
Should your voice is fading away in the background.
I got to go downstairs.

1151
01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.900
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
We're the,

1152
01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:29.520
questions are no,
that's it.
All right.
All right.

1153
01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:34.110
<v 0>And your little attic loft here.
Don't set up too quickly.</v>

1154
01:09:34.111 --> 01:09:38.820
You'll hit your head on the beam again.
No,

Jesus.
Of,
why am I done?

1155
01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:42.123
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1156
01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:47.770
<v 0>we got a little tree for department here.
Um,
all right,</v>

1157
01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:52.700
here we go.
Well that was a fucking waste of God.
Damn.

1158
01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:53.531
I thought,

1159
01:09:53.531 --> 01:09:55.690
I thought she was finally going to agree with me just one of these times.

1160
01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.550
I want her to fucking agree with me.
She just wants do it.

1161
01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:02.080
She just will not do it.
All right.
Um,
AH,
fuck.

1162
01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:05.260
This thing's going to take forever to load this fucking slow ass internet here.

1163
01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.360
Let's uh,
I got to read a couple of more advertising in.

1164
01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.580
I'll blow through these last couple of questions.
All right.

1173
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:40.210
They email you a list of clothes,
they recommend sending you a,

1174
01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.390
they recommend sending you,

A better wardrobe.
Then he could ever pick out yourself in minutes.

1178
01:10:54.191 --> 01:10:56.560
So maybe you could pick out of just to go to wardrobe,

1179
01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.770
but if someone else is going to fucking do it,
why do you need to do it?

1219
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:35.760
This guy's not pulling any punches here to give you a small sample of her.

1220
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.230
I'll elaborate a bit.
All right,
so you can get a small sample.

1221
01:13:40.231 --> 01:13:44.070
You're going to elaborate this guys just fucking,
he he's,
he's,

1222
01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:48.510
he's young in Yangon.
He's zigging and zagging.
Uh,
she's a narcissist.

1223
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:53.490
Nina Yang.
It was bad.
She's a narcissist to her very core in straight up stupid.

1224
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:59.040
She sounds like she's hot.
She's abusive to my dad.

1225
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:00.390
Oh,
she's definitely good looking.

1226
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:05.440
Even though he has cut his Roman half to accommodate her moving into a small

1227
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:06.210
apartment.

1228
01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:10.410
She hurls insults at him and when she doesn't get her way and talk shit under a

1229
01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:12.310
breath,
um,

1230
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:17.110
when she hurls insults at him when she doesn't get away and talk shit under a

1231
01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:20.860
breath so we can't hear it.
But I can and it's fucking infuriating.

1232
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:22.900
My Dad is a really,

1233
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:27.400
is really is a good man who has worked as a teacher for nearly 30 years and I

1234
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:28.690
respect the hell out of him.

1235
01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:33.970
It kills me to see or treat him like yesterday's dog shit also.

1236
01:14:33.971 --> 01:14:37.630
She's a massive whore.
Jesus' body.

1237
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:41.440
This is your sister since I almost,
no,

1238
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:47.390
I,
I almost know that she sucks Dick for weed.

1239
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.100
All right dude.
This is getting sad here.
Truly.

1240
01:14:51.101 --> 01:14:54.940
She is one of the most ugly and insensitive people that could ever exist.

1241
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:58.210
In addition to that,
she loves to talk about how good she looks.

1242
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.450
She's lost a lot of weight and while I was supportive at first,

1243
01:15:01.451 --> 01:15:02.470
she rapidly became,

1244
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.180
began to make fun of me and made me feel bad about my body to proper self up.

1245
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:12.640
Dude,
this is like a reality show.
This is sad on so many different levels.

1246
01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:17.420
Uh,
fun fact.
She starved herself,
became a believer.

1247
01:15:17.421 --> 01:15:21.070
Mick took weight loss pills and never worked out.

1248
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:23.390
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1249
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:25.040
<v 0>So what the fuck is that bitch?</v>

1250
01:15:25.041 --> 01:15:28.160
The right to say anything to anyone about how they look.
All right dude.

1251
01:15:28.161 --> 01:15:30.530
You get a lot of anger towards your sister.
You established this.

1252
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.870
Now I need your help with your unique attitude of take.
No Shit Dude.

1253
01:15:35.871 --> 01:15:39.500
I take plenty of shit.
How do you handle,
it's easy to do not take any shit.

1254
01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:44.000
Was was a fucking individual on a podcast,
not talking to anybody.

1255
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:47.990
How do you handle someone like that?
I'm sure you've met hundreds like her.

1256
01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:52.070
What can you say?
What can you do to rein in this psycho bitch?

1257
01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.750
She abuses my dad.

1258
01:15:53.751 --> 01:15:56.660
She treats my little brother and I like total shit and she doesn't do anything

1259
01:15:56.661 --> 01:15:59.840
to keep the place clean.
So that usually falls on my dad and I.

1260
01:15:59.841 --> 01:16:03.530
All she does is use people and when they aren't useful anymore she discards them

1261
01:16:03.531 --> 01:16:07.040
like trash.
She's truly someone I've grown to despise and resent.

1262
01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:11.390
I try and keep her out of my mind as much as possible to keep my own sanity.

1263
01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:13.250
Uh,
I would have disowned her,

1264
01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:16.160
but since she lives with me it's makes it difficult.

1265
01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.640
I feel bad for my dad because he has to watch my sister and I argue,

1266
01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.810
I always have my dad's back and yell at her when she said some of our usual crap

1267
01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.650
that doesn't really do it anymore.
But that doesn't really do it anymore.

1268
01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.350
I'm not someone who has problems with a lot of people.

1269
01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:36.380
Most of the people I've met who know her or have told me similar horror stories.

1270
01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:40.370
If you can't think of anything to suggest,
I gladly accepted.

1271
01:16:40.371 --> 01:16:43.670
If you just bashed her on the podcast,
it won't solve anything,

1272
01:16:43.671 --> 01:16:45.500
but it will give me something to smile about.

1273
01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:49.130
What I see that dumb bitch come hopping into the living room and acting like

1274
01:16:49.131 --> 01:16:51.440
your shit doesn't stink.
Thanks for hearing me out.

1275
01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:55.710
Bill all the best to Unia and Cleo.
All right.
Um,

1276
01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:01.730
well you are living in some cramped quarters,

1277
01:17:01.731 --> 01:17:05.420
so that's definitely going to make you guys not like each other.
Um,

1278
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:10.520
it doesn't seem like your dad calls her out on her behavior.

1279
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:13.370
<v 1>So,
um,</v>

1280
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:18.110
I would say I would start working on my own life,

1281
01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:21.880
which is I would make enough money to move out and I,
it's a,

1282
01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:25.880
she's truly as horrible as you're saying.
I would,
uh,

1283
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:30.910
try to just see her on Thanksgiving and Christmas and um,

1284
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.411
you know,

1285
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:36.890
that stuff about her being the limit can starving yourself and taking weight

1286
01:17:36.891 --> 01:17:41.570
loss pills.
Um,
it's definitely

1287
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.930
probably should be addressed at some point.
Understatement.

1288
01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.320
Oh look who's back with Gruesbeck.
Oh,
Cutie Pie.
Um,

1289
01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:54.100
I'm kind of glad you didn't see all this.

1290
01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:57.820
This guy just said a bunch of horrible stuff about a sister that she's a whore.

1291
01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.930
Well,
and she also seems like a,
a complete sociopath,

1292
01:18:01.931 --> 01:18:04.270
but she just kind of uses people and when she can't,

1293
01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.940
she's got a lot of shit going on it sounds like.

1294
01:18:07.090 --> 01:18:08.900
But this is also just like a mess,

1295
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:13.930
but it's also if she has an eating disorder that's awful.
That's it.
That's it.

1296
01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.600
It's like a mental illness.
Maybe she's just dizzy.

1297
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:23.880
No,
sorry.
Am I fucking,
Nah,
somebody started asking.

1298
01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:30.890
<v 5>That's hardcore cause like if you,
if it's like really,</v>

1299
01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.660
<v 1>I knew a girl who was bulimic but she was a really nice person.</v>

1300
01:18:33.661 --> 01:18:35.310
She wasn't walking around with treating people like shit.

1301
01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:36.440
So I think that this girl had a,

1302
01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.340
<v 5>everybody,
not everyone's gonna like go about it the same.</v>

1303
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:41.680
<v 1>That's what I'm saying.
So maybe if she has like a full belly,</v>

1304
01:18:41.681 --> 01:18:42.640
she'd still be a cut.

1305
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:48.050
<v 5>That is very true.
Or is she?
Yeah.
Or She's like,
I'm a fucking,</v>

1306
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.913
just a mess.

1307
01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:53.690
This is kind of like when people have addicts or whatever as the blanks and they

1308
01:18:53.691 --> 01:18:57.380
feel like everyone is sort of like tiptoeing around them and they're like,

1309
01:18:57.381 --> 01:19:01.160
this person is a fucking jerk and an asshole.
Why are we,
you know,

1310
01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:02.570
and I'm doing all the right things.

1311
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:07.240
Like I don't understand why they are being tiptoed around and that's,

1312
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:08.150
it's not fair.

1313
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:11.930
<v 1>Yeah.
I think all three of them,
her,
her little brother and her dad</v>

1314
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:16.130
should,
uh,
say like,
listen,

1315
01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:20.940
if you don't stop acting the way you're acting,
you got to move out.
Right.

1316
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.520
Basically it,
and then when she's,
you know,
stomps around like some fucking,

1317
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:27.500
you know,
Clydesdale,

1318
01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:30.980
I wonder if they ever had any like good times together either than when they

1319
01:19:30.981 --> 01:19:32.090
were like six or something.

1320
01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:37.091
Like have they ever like gone out to eat and I have no idea what's going on with

1321
01:19:37.701 --> 01:19:40.400
you.
Like why are you so angry all the time?
Or as like,

1322
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.270
her behavior's so bad that you don't even want to be in the same room where

1323
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.530
there,
but I heard what you said that he should move out.

1324
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:50.170
That's basically the best solution.
I think it's just good.

1325
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.630
I think she's watching too many of those fucking shows where,
you know,

1326
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.350
she thinks she's got to have some fucking certain kinds of shoes and that type

1327
01:19:57.351 --> 01:20:02.030
of shit.
Or Dad's a teacher,
they're living in this small ass apartment and,
uh,

1328
01:20:02.031 --> 01:20:05.240
I think she wants the finer things in life and she's going to get it however she

1329
01:20:05.241 --> 01:20:07.300
needs to get it.
So right now she's like,
all right,

1330
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:12.250
I want to get all skinny and I'm going to fucking Bang my way to some weed,

1331
01:20:12.251 --> 01:20:16.090
the nice car.
And I think you've got a full on sociopath on your hands.

1332
01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:19.600
That's what I think.
And uh,
I think you guys need to gang up against her,

1333
01:20:19.601 --> 01:20:22.300
telling him fucking get her shit together that she has to move out.

1334
01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:24.580
And if your dad is,

1335
01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.480
can't get past the fact that that's the apple of our eye and he doesn't want to

1336
01:20:28.481 --> 01:20:31.210
do anything,
then you got to choose yourself and I would move the fuck out.

1337
01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:36.670
That's it.
All right.
Awful laugh.
Oh my God.
And he'll,
we,

1338
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:40.570
why are you saying that she's a sociopath?
I'm just curious.
Um,

1339
01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.290
because she treats her dad's like,
Shit.
She fucking,
uh,
uses.

1340
01:20:44.650 --> 01:20:46.230
This is his description.
Wow.

1341
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.050
She uses people and when she can't get anything from them,

1342
01:20:50.051 --> 01:20:52.900
she completely discard them,
which means she has no use for them,

1343
01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:57.380
but they're like,
they're like a light bulb that burned out.
All right.

1344
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:59.200
I understand what this card means.

1345
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.320
<v 5>Sorry,
I just fed.</v>

1346
01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:07.860
<v 1>Geez.
All right.
You know what?
I deserve that.
Alright.
Awful laugh.</v>

1347
01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:13.600
Hey,
Mister Bill,
birth canal.
They always did.

1348
01:21:13.601 --> 01:21:18.180
They try to come up with clever ways to,
uh,
with my name.
I say,
hey,

1349
01:21:18.181 --> 01:21:22.490
build ginger.
Had men said a gingerbread man.
That's good.
It's decent,
right?

1350
01:21:22.491 --> 01:21:23.940
That's all right.
Okay.
All right.

1351
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:26.610
I need the brilliant wisdom that only a middle aged,

1352
01:21:26.611 --> 01:21:29.190
balding redhead could give you.
That this is how they do it.

1353
01:21:29.191 --> 01:21:32.010
They compliment and they slapped me around a little bit.
Uh,

1354
01:21:32.011 --> 01:21:37.011
I'm dating a lady who couldn't win a Hooters model contest.

1355
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:38.610
Wow.

1356
01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.080
<v 5>She can win a Hooters model contest.</v>

1357
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.590
Why that girl in a Paris and put her on the runway at Chanel?

1358
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:46.763
<v 1>Sorry</v>

1359
01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:51.130
<v 5>guys.
Hey,
what do you guys hate it when we say you're pretty?
No,
no.</v>

1360
01:21:51.131 --> 01:21:51.970
It's not that.

1361
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.290
It's this thing that is supposed to be like this fucking ultimate compliment.

1362
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:59.290
Then she can win a modeling contest at Hooters.

1363
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.840
I'm any other woman who was,

1364
01:22:01.841 --> 01:22:06.400
and this is nothing against Hooter's actually because I have all the alligator

1365
01:22:06.401 --> 01:22:08.080
arm at shit on odors,

1366
01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:13.060
but I'm saying like it's just funny to me what men or young guys consider a

1367
01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:16.240
compliment.
She could win a full game.
Hooters Ma,

1368
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:20.980
I'm sorry if there's any girl that work at Hooters.

1369
01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.500
I fucking love Hooters and the girls are super smooth dough like Hooters and

1370
01:22:24.501 --> 01:22:27.610
it's all fake.
It's suited.
You're insulted by it.
I'm not.
It's,

1371
01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:32.310
I think it's funny the way he described her as saying she could win a Hooters.

1372
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.810
My,
there's something really funny about that.

1373
01:22:34.811 --> 01:22:36.640
There was something funny about that,
but I'll tell you this stuff

1374
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.130
<v 1>you're thinking about.
You got to go on the road with me though,
Nigga.
Okay.</v>

1375
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.200
You got to go on the road.
You've got to understand,

1376
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:46.320
you know when you live in the middle of fucking nowhere,

1377
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.660
you know and you get big deals.

1378
01:22:48.661 --> 01:22:52.720
You go down to the fucking cracker barrel and you and you get down,
you get,

1379
01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:56.640
you get down to one little golf pig and that means you're a genius

1380
01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:58.860
<v 5>that's out there.
Nia out there.</v>

1381
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:04.390
I'm being classes by laughing at that description because he can't just say she

1382
01:23:04.391 --> 01:23:08.110
died.
This girl is really beautiful because he goes on.
I'm actually funny,

1383
01:23:08.111 --> 01:23:11.830
intelligent level headed and as a smoker that's,
those are wonderful things,

1384
01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:14.950
but like the Hooters model contest,
first of all,

1385
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:17.630
I didn't know that they had model contests.

1386
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:23.310
Let's you mean that she could get a job at Hooters because I'm going to kind of

1387
01:23:23.311 --> 01:23:27.100
get a word in there.
I was actually,
I was being a dick.
Oh,

1388
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:28.420
I'm joking around.

1389
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.260
I love cracker barrel and I love when I fucking get down to the one little golf

1390
01:23:32.261 --> 01:23:35.650
spike.
It makes me feel like I am intelligent.
They've got that little game.

1391
01:23:35.651 --> 01:23:38.500
If you haven't been to cracker barrel and a million,

1392
01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.790
you shouldn't cause they said that racist shit a long time ago and I portray our

1393
01:23:42.791 --> 01:23:45.230
relationship every time I go there and get their rigs.

1394
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.090
All right.
She's funny,

1395
01:23:49.210 --> 01:23:54.210
intelligent level headed and as a smoking hot body m an epic chest we meet with,

1396
01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:57.070
that's where the quitters part comes in.

1397
01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:01.690
She's got a great pocket wreck and that motor is a model.
God.
All right.

1398
01:24:01.691 --> 01:24:04.360
I'm sorry.
What should shooter you said the Applebee's fucking

1399
01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.440
like a bring chicken.

1400
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.680
Incredibly subpar login restaurant chain with the most basic and require realize

1401
01:24:16.061 --> 01:24:19.470
what a snob you sound like to be sitting here in Paris.
Shit.
Nine hoarders.

1402
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:26.710
Mama's l.
Absolutely.
I love it.
I love their popcorn shrimp.

1403
01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:32.120
You see down here.
Don't ever forget that.
Don't ever fucking forget that.

1404
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:37.330
I don't give a fuck where you're at or what you're doing at the end of the day.

1405
01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.170
You like Hooters,
lemon popcorn,
shrimp,
lemon popcorn,
shrimp,

1406
01:24:41.171 --> 01:24:45.220
the lemon pepper wings and the Buffalo Popcorn shrimp.
That shit is amazing.

1407
01:24:45.221 --> 01:24:47.860
And they have really big drinks.
It could be a little stronger though,

1408
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:52.300
at least in the Hollywood one.
But uh,
no I don't.
I really don't have a problem.

1409
01:24:52.330 --> 01:24:54.280
I just saw the final 10 years of your life.

1410
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.340
You've just an absolute lush sitting next to a pool.

1411
01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.650
Why isn't this fucking it?
Bigger eating fucking lemon chicken waste.

1412
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:07.930
I would never have a Martini at Hooters.
I mean Margarita,
maybe

1413
01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:13.690
that's a kind of place you get a fireball shot.
You know what,
Nia,

1414
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:19.130
you really suck gross right now.
This is my fault anyway.

1415
01:25:19.131 --> 01:25:22.630
Let's don't it my fault.
Oh,
there are lots of personality.
Shut up.

1416
01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:25.420
I'm reading this.
Why would I complain you as well?

1417
01:25:25.421 --> 01:25:29.380
Because you're a guy and say you have to complain about something because

1418
01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:34.810
I feel like putting a bullet in my head,
it sounds like

1419
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.030
when we were at dinner at Hooters,

1420
01:25:40.031 --> 01:25:43.450
I assume she lasts as loud and as awful as she can.

1421
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.940
I can see all the shot tables in my peripheral vision and hear the baby's nearby

1422
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:51.940
began to violently weep.
Okay,
now you're being hyperbolic.
Uh,
when,

1423
01:25:51.941 --> 01:25:52.930
whenever she labs,

1424
01:25:52.931 --> 01:25:56.830
I do my best to stare at her rack and appreciate her until the storm is over.

1425
01:25:56.831 --> 01:25:57.820
This is actually kind of funny.

1426
01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:02.200
This girl has practically wife material with every lap.
I lose the will to live.

1427
01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:06.020
I'm a 26 year old male with options,
right?

1428
01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.490
<v 1>You know what?
He's such an asshole.
You just shit all over the gun.
This is good.</v>

1429
01:26:11.491 --> 01:26:15.690
You bounce it out.
Nothing.
That guy said,
that whole fucking hyperbole thing.

1430
01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:19.440
If some woman wrote that like a coyote and trash compactor and like the baby's

1431
01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:22.560
crying around there,
you would have laughed.
Oh my God,
this girl is hilarious.

1432
01:26:22.561 --> 01:26:26.760
But if a guy does it there,
there are a fucking asshole.
Let me finish this out.

1433
01:26:26.761 --> 01:26:29.830
I got your buddy.
Here we go.
This girl is practically wife,

1434
01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:32.010
26 year old male with options.

1435
01:26:32.011 --> 01:26:36.420
He does have options and what's Facebook now the world is his option.
Oh,

1436
01:26:36.421 --> 01:26:40.440
grandpa.
Uh,
I'm sorry.
What is it?
Instagram.

1437
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:45.660
Is it a meme?
Is that how you meet somebody?
No
Pussy meme.

1438
01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.820
But realistically,
I don't know if I have the potential to top this girl.

1439
01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.550
Uh,
do you sell yourself short?
What do I do?

1440
01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:58.300
Do I suck it up and look past it or do I put on a,

1441
01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.980
or do I put on the breakup suit and dump her moments before leaping out of the

1442
01:27:01.981 --> 01:27:05.460
car?
Your advice and possibly the lovely Nias would be wonderful.

1443
01:27:05.461 --> 01:27:07.530
As calls you the lovely Nia and you're shitting on him.

1444
01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:11.750
I'm sure I speak for many when I say Yah.
Okay.

1445
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:15.480
Sincerely possible suicide victim.
All right dude,

1446
01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:19.110
you don't love this girl enough to look past or laugh cause I really think if

1447
01:27:19.111 --> 01:27:23.760
you really loved her,
the fact that she had that crazy laugh,
you would,

1448
01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:28.290
they would actually,
in some weird way you find it adorable.
Uh,

1449
01:27:28.291 --> 01:27:30.750
I think she's just tired.
I think she's hot.

1450
01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.150
I think you have a little bit of low self esteem where you see,

1451
01:27:33.151 --> 01:27:35.580
you're looking at your age,
like what you,
what are you,

1452
01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:38.670
what are you going to fucking eggs and you,
you don't,
all right.
You're a guy.

1453
01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:43.530
You're young forever.
You know your biological clock isn't ticking.
You know,

1454
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:48.570
I just say this shit just to get you going.
All right.
Yeah.
26 year old like,
yeah,

1455
01:27:48.571 --> 01:27:52.740
you got all the options in the world.
She's fucking smoking hard,
right?

1456
01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.840
Banger one more time and then fucking dumper.
Right.
Sorry.

1457
01:27:57.841 --> 01:27:59.700
I'm fucking with him.
Just,
just get out of it.

1458
01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:03.060
Just get out of the relationship and uh,
and that's the thing though,

1459
01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:07.870
but don't tell her why.
Don't say because you're fucking laugh.

1460
01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.800
Well she can't do any of our laugh Nia.
I know.

1461
01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:16.380
<v 5>No bad.
Actually it's,
you go man for them both because like I'm trying to,</v>

1462
01:28:16.381 --> 01:28:19.770
I was just trying to put myself in the situation like I,
you know,

1463
01:28:19.771 --> 01:28:24.771
being crazy about you and if you'd just had like the worst laugh like yeah,

1464
01:28:24.811 --> 01:28:26.790
like who do we know?

1465
01:28:26.791 --> 01:28:30.810
Somebody that has a lap like that that's like kind of like has like a honking

1466
01:28:30.811 --> 01:28:33.450
and they'll laugh and it's,
and it's funny,

1467
01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:38.130
but I'm sure the first time the person he's with heard it,
she was like,

1468
01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.590
Whoa,
okay.

1469
01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:44.280
But the thing is a person who laughs like that other,

1470
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:47.490
you laugh at them for their laugh,
they laugh even more.

1471
01:28:47.491 --> 01:28:50.570
Everybody laughs at them and it becomes like a,
like that girl,

1472
01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.830
<v 1>if you love them,
you love them.
Oh my God,
I want to</v>

1473
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.330
<v 5>really that bad.
Like is it,</v>

1474
01:28:57.990 --> 01:29:00.730
<v 1>which,
I'm not going to say the name,
I'm not going to say the name,</v>

1475
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.530
but I used to have somebody,
a one of my agents,

1476
01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.910
that's what I was just talking about.

1477
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:09.240
One of my agents that I loved him to death and actually loved his laugh,

1478
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:13.710
especially because you could hear it and when he was in the crowd and I knew

1479
01:29:13.711 --> 01:29:17.960
that he thought the joke was funny and he had seen a bunch of comedy.

1480
01:29:17.961 --> 01:29:22.010
So to really get him to laugh was an amazing thing here.
Right now.

1481
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:27.870
I remember being onstage at Caroline's and I'm killing for a half an hour.

1482
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:30.630
And I,
and I knew he was in the crowd,
but I'm not thinking that.

1483
01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.910
I'm just thinking of doing my shit.
And about a half hour in,

1484
01:29:32.911 --> 01:29:36.510
I tried this new bit and I ripped this thing in a fucking killed in the middle

1485
01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:40.940
of that.
I hear in the back of the club,
you just hear
the hog.
Yeah.
But I have,

1486
01:29:40.941 --> 01:29:45.750
I'm not even doing the thing.
Yeah.
And uh,
yeah.

1487
01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:49.290
And He,
and he hated his laugh too.
He hated his laugh and he's just like,
I know.

1488
01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:53.900
That's how I left on flower,
blah,
blah,
uh,
fucking sweet out of a gun.

1489
01:29:54.370 --> 01:29:56.940
Great.
We're talking about a leg is dead.

1490
01:29:59.630 --> 01:30:03.680
Uh,
I got a to spark your stuff is this internet here stinks and this is going to

1491
01:30:03.681 --> 01:30:08.250
take me forever to upload this.
Did I really go an hour and a half?

1492
01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:13.100
Fuck,
uh,
really quickly near,
sorry.
Sorry for the,
uh,

1493
01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:16.350
getting you there too early to the tennis match.

1494
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:20.790
You're hung in there like a fucking champ.
Did you talk about that?
Yeah,

1495
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.130
I basically said that I had a great fucking time,
but,

1496
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.500
but the crowd is not my crowd.

1497
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:32.670
I mean,
let's kill,
let's kill the hood.
The hood is crowd.
Isn't your crowd either?

1498
01:30:32.671 --> 01:30:37.010
Nia?
I love the Hooters.
The restaurant.
All right.

1499
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.820
I like the Hooters restaurant.

1500
01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.970
It's a weird one because you've got all this shit and then you got the rogue

1501
01:30:44.971 --> 01:30:49.110
person that's like,
come on Casey.
Like we,
when we are Australia,

1502
01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.680
you'd have people get mad.
They get mad at somebody,
yell,

1503
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:54.510
scream out because it's like they have to concentrate.

1504
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:57.290
Can I give you what to do that on the golf field?

1505
01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:01.440
I feel like it's a similar thing,
right?
Literally what I just said.
Okay.

1506
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:04.560
It's a golf course.
Yeah.
So it's weird,

1507
01:31:04.830 --> 01:31:08.370
but there's this aggression to it as well.
It's a golf course,
not a golf field.

1508
01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:13.830
Did I say for Garfield Golf Stadium when you were at the golf arena?
All right.

1509
01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:16.440
I am,
I have to wrap this up because this thing's going to take forever to load.

1510
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:20.160
All right?
Okay.
All right.
That's just once again,

1511
01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:23.490
thank you for everybody for listening.
Thanks for writing in all of that shit.

1512
01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.600
I got the,
uh,
I got my tour coming up.
Um,
when I get back,

1513
01:31:27.601 --> 01:31:32.330
I can't wait to do stand up.
Um,
I miss it,
man.

1514
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:36.630
I fucking miss it.
Um,
let me read off the dates here.
Uh,

1515
01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:41.200
I will be in Portland,
Oregon.
Fucking love that.

1516
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:48.300
I never even heard that Portland,
Oregon.
There you haven't been,

1517
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:52.830
you haven't been to Portland.
No.
I would love to know.

1518
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:55.490
I've spent enough time with you.
I've spent enough time with him.

1519
01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.620
[inaudible] Portland,
Oregon.
This,
listen,

1520
01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.350
I'm telling you some of the best fucking food,
Portland and Seattle.

1521
01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:06.790
Unbelievably beautiful.
Fucking awesome.
Oh,
cool.
As people.

1522
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:09.820
It's fucking unbelievable.
Sacramento,
California.

1523
01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.510
I'm going next June 19th,
the capitol.
June 19th.

1524
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:16.900
I don't know shit about Sacramento other than I used to say in this horrific

1525
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:21.010
comedy club condo across from the punchline out there.

1526
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:24.220
And the only thing I could do is walk to this dirty Mcdonald's where there was

1527
01:32:24.221 --> 01:32:24.941

1532
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:49.420

I'm in San Jose.

1533
01:32:49.421 --> 01:32:52.390
I've been there a bunch of times.
I love that fucking town.
Fresno.

1534
01:32:52.391 --> 01:32:54.400
Never been to Fresno.
One of the thing I've seen,

1535
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:58.120
there's about gang activity and they have,
uh,

If not,

1537
01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:03.610

Uh,

I don't know why.

1539
01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.780

Wasn't that Brewster Baker?
Kenny Rogers.

1540
01:33:13.781 --> 01:33:18.650
That's why Bruce to Baker.

Nope.
Okay.

1541
01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:24.160
Then I'm in Las Vegas on the 26th,
the Mirage,
and then I'm in Tucson,

1542
01:33:24.161 --> 01:33:28.980

And uh,

1543
01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.430
Arlene Schnitzer,
the Arlene Schnitzer concert hall.
Who is that?

1544
01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:35.230
Somebody who died but accomplished,

1545
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.760
accomplished enough in life.

1546
01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:43.090
Sorry.

1547
01:33:43.090 --> 01:33:46.670
That we went on and how you are and you turned to mean you're like a woman and

1548
01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:51.280

Oh,

We'll,

1549
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:55.170

Okay.
That sounds good.
No,

I,
okay.

1550
01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.730
Clico was that what it is?
It's CLICO.
Yeah,
she wanted,

1551
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.110
my wife is such a drunk.
She wanted to say,

1552
01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.350
she wanted to take a tour of how they make champagne.

1553
01:34:06.250 --> 01:34:10.960
So we get an we fucking drive out to the countryside and uh,

1554
01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.110
went to this really cool ass town.
I forget what it was called.

1555
01:34:14.111 --> 01:34:18.070
And we took a tour of this thing and,
uh,
I hate champagne.

1556
01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.980
Gives me a brutal hangover.
I don't like sweet shit.
Right?
Um,

1557
01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:27.300
so they used to have these minds where they dug for chalk and you went down like

1558
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.480
these are shut up.
They went down these 80 fucking I do,
I get through.

1559
01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:39.010
This is such a cool fucking story.
I'll tell it on Thursday.
Anyways,

1560
01:34:39.011 --> 01:34:39.970
long story short,

1561
01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.040
a guy actually came up with the shit and then he died at 27,
and then,

1562
01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:49.150
uh,
she was the love of his life.
[inaudible] vote means the widow.

1563
01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.770
And that was the last name.

1564
01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:54.640
She kept the last name of her husband that died and she took over this
champagne,

1565
01:34:54.641 --> 01:34:59.000
but she fucking perfected it and took it to the next level and an event in a way

1566
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:03.200
to get that sediment out of it to make it clear as shit.
Um,

1567
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:06.260
and she kinda did some fucking scumbag shit though,

1568
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:10.130
that all great companies have to do if they're going to go internationally.

1569
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:15.110
When Napoleon lost to the Russians,
okay.

1570
01:35:15.230 --> 01:35:19.160
French guy,
they lost to the Russians and the Russians wanted to celebrate.

1571
01:35:19.161 --> 01:35:22.340
She fucking sent them over champagne to the,

1572
01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:25.470
to the people that fucking just beat her called countries.

1573
01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:29.560
And it's fucking horrific.
But I'll tell you right now.
Yeah.

1574
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:33.940
But you know every God,
yeah,
she has,

1575
01:35:33.941 --> 01:35:37.250
she behaved like a bank does.
They got money on both horses.
Whoever wins,

1576
01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:42.050
they still,
and like don king,
but at a fucking corporate level.
All right,

1577
01:35:42.051 --> 01:35:44.900
I'm done.
Go Fuck Yourself.
So I'll talk to you on Thursday.
I'll check in.
No,

1578
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:45.270
and yeah.
