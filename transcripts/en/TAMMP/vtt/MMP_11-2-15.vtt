00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.500
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:06.230
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.370
November 2nd,
2015 oh my God.

4
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:17.020
It's no fair.
You know,
the greatest holiday of the year for me

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.500
is what?
Thanksgiving.
I like it.
It's family.
You get to eat.
What about flag day?

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.850
That's a good one,
isn't it?
Why don't you go underground support that indie band,

7
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.800
right?
They could do that.
Labor days.
Another good one.

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.100
<v 1>A blueberry pancake day or whatever the fuck it was that time when I was in</v>

10
00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:43.030
Atlanta,
I would tell you guys that story.
I wanted to do morning TV,

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.250
the worst fucking thing a comedian can ever do.

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.300
It doesn't sell one fucking ticket.
You know,

13
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:53.710
watch his morning TV.
Fucking a stay at home moms.

14
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.480
You know,
you know those in,
in the,
in those awful stay at home moms.

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.990
Oh cool.
Stay at home.
Mom probably pops in a good movie or some shit like that.

16
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:03.651
But those,
you know,

17
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:08.651
those ones that talk to kids like they're fucking morons and they do it.

18
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.930
Like,
you know it's bad enough when the kids really little,

19
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.050
but when they're like six years old and they're still going like

20
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.560
they do that fucking up and down talking with like their eyes really fucking

21
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.940
open eyebrows way up.
Huh?

22
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.803
<v 2>Woo.</v>

23
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.510
<v 1>You just want to fucking slap him in the back of the head like what are you</v>

24
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:34.020
doing and do me a favor.
Don't talk to my dog like that.

25
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:36.240
Cause you're going to freak her out and she's going to go for your throat.

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.630
All she's going to hear is heightened excitement and she's going to be thinking

27
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.120
someone's going to beat the shit out of her again like [inaudible] or whoever

28
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:45.480
the fuck did it to her before I got her.
Isn't that right?

29
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:49.220
Cleal Huh?
She's over there already sleeping.

30
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.150
There's fucking dog slept for Aki.
Diem hours last night.
Right?

31
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.900
Right next to me.
By the way,
I hadn't seen her in like two weeks.

32
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.520
So I was watching the Casey met game and I actually fell asleep before the end

33
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.640
of it.
I was so fucking tired.
And then of course,

34
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.480
I wake up afterwards and I see Casey celebrating.
By the way,

35
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:12.050
congratulations to Kansas City,
my condolence to mets fans,
uh,

36
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.650
just to fucking great teams.
And it was so great to see,
you know,

37
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.260
not to see Yankees,
red sox car knows giants,

38
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:22.760
the fucking people who have been in it.
It's nice to see new blood.
Um,

39
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.620
so anyways,
I'm sitting in,

40
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.630
I'm trying to fucking see the highlight and I'm just sitting there and my dog

41
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:34.080
likes this.
My dog is a master like Cutler.

42
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.570
The thing is all away,

43
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.970
like legs tucked underneath and it's fucking guts.

44
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:43.740
It's head right on my chest,
right with its muzzle,

45
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.700
almost like just like staring at me and it's snoring.

46
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.980
So I don't want to wake the thing up.

47
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.250
And I'm sitting there and the remotes on the other side of my fucking dog and

48
00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:54.750
I'm like,
I can't wait this thing up.

49
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.860
And I'm sitting there waiting for a fucking highlight.
And they got this guy

50
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.510
who's just standing there going on and on and on and on and on and on and on

51
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.080
about the fucking game about what happened and blah,
blah,
blah.
It's like,

52
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.350
show a fucking highlight.
You jerk off.
What are you,

53
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.460
the president given some fucking state of the union thing.

54
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.330
So many fucking ESPN shows now.
I've just too fucking people sitting there,

55
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:27.100
standing there,
walking around,
talk and talk and talk it to death.
Fucking chin.

56
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:32.050
I want to see highlights.
Show him all fucking day long.
I will sit.

57
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:33.730
I used to watch sports center back when I had the time.

58
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.930
I'd watch it like three times in a fucking row.
I didn't give a shit.
Same jokes,

59
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:40.000
same fucking clips,
all of that.
I loved it.

60
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.220
These fucking idiots sitting there talking and talking and talking.
I wouldn't,

61
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.650
I should talk,
right?
I do a fucking podcast by myself.
Um,

62
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.060
so then I turned the fucking channel.
I'm like,
all right.

63
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.910
They got like 50 to ESPN.
So I go up to ESPN two.

64
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.140
There's two other jerk off sitting there talking,
talking,
talking,
talking,

65
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.300
talking.
And they show in the scores and all of this type of shit.

66
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:00.880
And for the life of me,
I haven't seen it.
I heard what happened.

67
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.310
I heard they let the,
let the pitcher stay in and then he walked the fucking guy.

68
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.310
Then there was a double blah blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

69
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.260
And then there was a play at third and the fucking guy,
you know,

70
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.930
they looked at each other then right.

71
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:16.000
Throws the ball and the guy who fucking takes off,

72
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:19.090
it's a close play at the plate.
The throws little.
I've yet to see it.

73
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.470
I think it's worth.
Um,
so anyways,

74
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:27.760
so I don't really know.
Uh,
I don't know what happened.

75
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.570
All of that that I know is cause actually not cause the ESPN.

76
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:34.240
It's cause I talked to Paul version of this morning,
who by the way,

77
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.330
is really excited that the mets lost,

78
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.420
I've found during the series that he fucking,
he hates the mets.

79
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:43.960
He hates the mets fans.
Don't let them say anything differently.

80
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.630
Don't let them try to be a class act.
I'm telling you,

81
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.090
they'll run the running joke on the tour was a Paul Versey wants no joy in

82
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:57.940
queens
cause we were all sitting there like,
I'm a fucking,
you know,

83
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:01.510
red sox fan.
I shouldn't like any team from New York,
but I don't give a fuck.

84
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:05.820
Right.
It's a mess.
You know,
they haven't won it since 86.
Fuck it.

85
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.390
I don't care if they win it.
Um,
so I want,
I wanted to see,

86
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:14.640
I basically,
I wanted to see a seven game series is what I wanted to see.
And uh,

87
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.223
put first,

88
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.750
very silently rooting very hard against the mets and he wouldn't admit it and he

89
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:25.990
just,
no,
no,
no,
no,
I don't,
I don't care.
You know,
I just want,

90
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.700
I just want to see a good series and that he would get,

91
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.480
he would get just a little too excited when Casey would be coming back.
So,
um,

92
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.250
and he was,
I'm just sitting here fucking babbling.
Uh,

93
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.880
I did Miss Halloween this year was the first time I have not been at my house

94
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.890
during Halloween.
Um,

95
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.590
which I'm actually happy about it cause I told you where I live,

96
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:47.260
I live in this weird area where it's like if you go a little,

97
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.970
if you go to the right,
it gets really nice.
If you go to the left,

98
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:55.780
there's like a check cashing place,
like a block away,
you know what I mean?

99
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.920
And I'm sort of in the middle.

100
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.420
So during Halloween I get everything from little snot nose rich kids too.

101
00:06:01.421 --> 00:06:05.640
Like what I had like a year ago where this fucking like,

102
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.810
I dunno,
37 year old dude showed it.
He looked like a fucking homeless Jim Croce.

103
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.640
He just fucking showed up,
right.
Big fucking mustache,
Tom Selleck style.

104
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.060
And it was just standing there and I'm just opening the door.

105
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

106
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.020
<v 1>Oh I know.
I,</v>

107
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.340
he had some kids with them and they all left and he had a bag too and he held

108
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.450
the bag out and I just went really?
And he just goes,
yes,

109
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.220
I go really?
Or something like that.
Seriously.
It just goes yes.

110
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.200
And I just fucking gave,
what was I going to do?
That was Joe Good in Chicago.

111
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:41.900
It's like I got to give it to him.
He knows where the fuck I live.
Right.

112
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.500
That's the thing.
He can't fuck people over on Halloween.
They know what you live.

113
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.620
<v 3>Okay.</v>

114
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.160
<v 1>Did they get to do something?
They're going to walk down your fucking thing.</v>

115
00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:53.430
They're going to fucking punch your mailbox and pulled a little flag off of it.

116
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.050
You know,
Yank some fucking,
I dunno,
plant out of the ground,

117
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.190
which I don't give a shit.
Right.
If it's not fucking making me any food,

118
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:05.230
what do I need it for?
Well,
because they exhale oxygen.

119
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.020
We get it.
So anyways,
um,

120
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.950
<v 3>okay.</v>

121
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.870
<v 1>Dude,
I,
I've completely shot from that tour.
I'm so fucking exhausted.</v>

122
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.400
Um,
and it isn't from the shows.
The shows were great.

123
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.690
The people were great,
the venues were great,
but,
um,

124
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.680
my fucking drink every single night for fucking two weeks.
And um,

125
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.560
<v 3>yeah,</v>

126
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.860
<v 1>every night I was like,
yeah,
I can't do what I can't do it.
And that was the joke.</v>

127
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.600
The joke started to become before we shelf,
we would just be going like,

128
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.330
all right man,
tonight we're just going home,
going home early,

129
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.170
which is fucking getting eight hours work out.
Right.

130
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.610
Maybe find a spa,
we'll take a steam,
have a nice fucking healthy breakfasts.

131
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:57.890
Everybody's nodding.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

132
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.200
And then fucking somebody finishes their set and they just got the devil in

133
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:04.250
their eye when they come off.

134
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.650
And then they would look at me and I would just start laughing.

135
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:10.340
And the next thing you know,
we go out again.
So we're in Chicago.

136
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:15.341
My Pie dog town Chicago is

137
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.580
a badge of mustaches.
Chicago is actually,
I didn't see a lot of them.

138
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.230
Michigan Avenue with all those shops.

139
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.400
20 Harry Carey restaurants,

140
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.110
which was the original.
Um,
so anyways,

141
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.930
we ended up going out one night.

142
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.053
<v 3>MMM.</v>

143
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.720
<v 1>I'm trying to,
I'm trying to piece this together.</v>

144
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.350
This is the drunkest I've been in like fucking 10 years.
We went out to this,

145
00:08:49.351 --> 00:08:50.184
this,

146
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.900
this bar called the Liar's club and it was like a bar that basically a bunch of

147
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.760
hung out at and we fucking get in there and I don't plan on doing any fucking

148
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:04.290
damage whatsoever.
Right.
Friend of mine lives in town,
she's a photographer.

149
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.490
She came down to take some pictures,
right?
She brings her crew of people.

150
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:11.820
We go out and just fucking get into the bar

151
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.240
and I dunno,
I dunno what happened.
They fucking go,

152
00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:20.710
what kind of music do you like?
And I said,
why like eight and Sagel.

153
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.060
How about ACDC?
Right.
And they just played like all this shit.

154
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:28.740
You never fucking here all this shit.
You're never here.
Everybody was playing.

155
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:31.200
She shook me all night.
Although somebody did play,
you shook me all night long.

156
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.370
Uh,
they played like kicked in the teeth,

157
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.320
down payment,
blues,
um,

158
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.410
houses on fire.
They point shit off.

159
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.280
Powerage flick of the switch,
you know,

160
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:51.450
side to a highway to hell dude.
And me and Bart,
nick,

161
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.420
we're going fucking nuts.

162
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.870
Like for Czi was an angel that night.
He barely dragged.

163
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:01.530
He just said he wanted to go home.
He was just sitting there and like,

164
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:06.330
at one point barnick you know who's like the size of like fucking Cam Neely,

165
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:09.270
right?
He's fucking doing the Angus,
you know,

166
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:11.220
Chuck Berry thing going across the bar.

167
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:16.221
People go and fucking nuts and everybody just kept buying shots and like an

168
00:10:16.321 --> 00:10:17.910
asshole.
I just kept doing them.

169
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.990
I think I threw down like nine or 10 shots while I was drinking whiskey.

170
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:26.490
So I was like chasing whiskey shots with whiskey and um,

171
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.311
you know,

172
00:10:28.311 --> 00:10:31.790
you wouldn't think that you could go out on a dance floor and dance to a AC DC.

173
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:32.960
But God dammit,
I did it.
Yeah.

174
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:42.280
Oh,
and did I pay for it?
I fucking paid for it.
And then I,
I,
you know,

175
00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:45.520
by the end of the night,
I,
I vaguely remember leaving the bar.

176
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.470
It might've been the best night of the fucking tour.
We had so much fucking fun.

177
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:55.090
Versus he actually said,
like,
he was saying that because he wasn't even drinking.

178
00:10:55.091 --> 00:10:56.020
He was going like,

179
00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.820
I actually wasn't join you and bart nick putting on a clinic on how to have fun

180
00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:04.190
in a bar.
He was like,
dude,
you guys will go and I don't even remember this.

181
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:06.730
She goes,
you guys were like headbanging.
He's like,

182
00:11:06.731 --> 00:11:10.030
burn your air drumming on the bar.
And then next thing you know,

183
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.980
me and [inaudible] both out on the dance floor dancing to ACDC,

184
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.130
<v 4>right?</v>

185
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.640
<v 1>This stupid disco ball going around us.
It was like if it was a movie,</v>

186
00:11:21.641 --> 00:11:23.700
it would have been like a verse.
He was saying.

187
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:27.630
It would have been like the montage scene of when me and Joe becomes best

188
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:32.200
friends before,
like we fucking a
for something.

189
00:11:32.201 --> 00:11:35.740
Whatever it happens,
sends it,
you know,
what do you remember the naked gun?

190
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.480
You remember the naked gun when,
uh,

191
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.210
Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley or doing all this shit,

192
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:45.330
running down the beach,
coming out of platoon,
laughing their asses off.

193
00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:49.280
It was basically that.
It was that,
that's what we did.
And the next day,

194
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.100
like I fucking woke up,
you know,

195
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.720
still in my clothes,

196
00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.360
in my bed and like I had all these plans.

197
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.240
I'm in Chicago,
I'm in one of the greatest cities in the country.

198
00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:06.320
And I had all these plans of what I was going to do at,
I swear to God,

199
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.710
like I couldn't get out of bed.

200
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.890
I couldn't get out of bed till like fucking three in the afternoon.
I was like,

201
00:12:10.891 --> 00:12:14.340
what?
I'm a fucking idiot.
And then at five o'clock I went down,

202
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.250
I went downstairs and,
uh,
I tried to get something to eat and I was no wait.

203
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.480
And he came up to my room
for his,

204
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.240
he came up to my room and we would just sit and have fucking watching TV.

205
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.650
And he was just laughing at how fucking just beat up Ho us,

206
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.940
you know,
of course he felt great because he was a fucking angel at night.
And I,

207
00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:39.480
um,
we ended up watching something on TV,

208
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.730
one of the sickest stories ever.
And we're like,
dude,

209
00:12:41.731 --> 00:12:46.260
this has to be a fucking movie.
And,
uh,
of course in the end they,
they,

210
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.740
they said that they were going to turn into movie was basically about this guy,

211
00:12:49.741 --> 00:12:53.730
right?
It was this fucking show about serial killers.

212
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.180
So of course we're going to watch it all right?

213
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.900
And I'm sitting there eating a fucking burger,
you know,
just trying to,
you know,

214
00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:03.990
Greece always fucking offsets the fucking alcohol.
It's awful.

215
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.350
I'm out of shape again guys.
Just one I'm trying to say.
Um,

216
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.150
so we'll watching this thing about fucking serial killers and the whole time

217
00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:13.050
that talking about this,

218
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.640
this drug dealer kid and well like kind of fucked is this getting,

219
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.360
they keep showing this serial killer guy.

220
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.680
It's like does in the show in the drug dealer,
older,

221
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.450
you know,
and not in jail and all that shit going,
what the fuck happened?

222
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.560
You know,
just the way they put it together,
it was a riveting,
you know,

223
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.670
like what the fuck is going on here?

224
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:37.620
So basically what happened was there was this kid,
right?
He played football,

225
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.160
they called them the assassin because every game he ever played,

226
00:13:41.161 --> 00:13:44.010
he took somebody out,
right?
Was it the assassin?

227
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.290
Was that Jack Tatum check Tatum and I forget what it was,

228
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:52.110
something like assassin.
So

229
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:58.650
he fucking uh,
and just movie star good looks all right.

230
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.850
And he's The star of the football team and the lady sitting there interviewing

231
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:05.940
them going as he's walking through round is high school going like,
so you were,

232
00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:10.260
uh,
you were basically a legend here.
And he goes,
yeah,
I was,

233
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.710
he wasn't being arrogant.
He said,
yeah,
he goes,
they retired my jersey,

234
00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:17.130
they had like pictures of me up on the wall and all that,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

235
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.740
All the women loved him.
I mean,
this guy was just like,
it was,
he,

236
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.040
he looked like a movie star in his life was a movie.

237
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.840
So he's Big Achilles heel was,

238
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.070
he didn't have money and he wanted to keep up with the rich kids.

239
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.970
So he started dealing drugs and he ended up being really good at it.

240
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.370
And by the time he was like 20 years old,

241
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.920
this fucking guy was making like $1 million a year.
Crushing it.
Right?

242
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.080
He's got a fake,
you know,

243
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.130
wall in his walk walking closet where he's got another room where he's keeping

244
00:14:50.131 --> 00:14:50.964
all the money in a,

245
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.910
he's thrown all these fucking crazy parties and it almost seemed like this

246
00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.170
American greed type story as opposed to this serial killer thing.

247
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:03.650
And they keep going back to this serial kill,
a fucking piece of shit.

248
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:08.420
Who's killing these girls?
These teenage girls?
So long story short,

249
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.760
he's laying in bed one night and he's just thinking,

250
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:13.910
I got to get out of this life.
I'm so sick of looking over my shoulder.

251
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.820
I can't do this anymore.
How am I going to get out of his butt?

252
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.870
He's addicted to the money.

253
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:20.060
He's addicted to the life and all of that type of stuff.

254
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.690
And he has this rattling on the door and I'm thinking,
oh fuck,

255
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:27.770
it's the serial killer.
And he obviously fought the guy in one.

256
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.150
What the fuck happens,
right?

257
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.360
All of a sudden the door fucking blasts open and all these fucking was,

258
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.910
is it the ATF that shows up when you get busted as a drug dealer now?

259
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:40.190
Who was that?
Alcohol.
Tobacco,
firearms.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

260
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:44.240
So anyways,
they fucking come.
FDA Food,
Drug Administration,

261
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.920
the uh,
transit Chicago Transit Authority.
I don't what the fuck it is.

262
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:50.180
Whatever the fuck that thing is.

263
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:54.470
They come fucking blast and through the door run up,
you know,

264
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:58.210
a bunch of guys with the fucking minor helmets on with the fucking ooze east

265
00:15:58.211 --> 00:16:02.210
from a Steven Seagal movie.
Go get on a graph.
You fucking look at me,

266
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.410
upload your fucking head off.

267
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.680
And the whole thing was over and he disgraced his family name and they never

268
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:09.351
said it,

269
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:12.590
but I imagine they probably took his fucking pictures down off of the high

270
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:15.740
school and all of that type of shit,
you know,
did some Oj Shit,
right?

271
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.500
Take all his trophies and all that fucking shit.
So it's over.
Right.

272
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.550
So then he's sitting in jail,
um,

273
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.900
and they tried to get him to flip and this is kids,

274
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:31.190
just some fucking kid from the suburbs,
right?
So I'm thinking,
well,
he's out.

275
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.540
He must eradicate somebody out so he doesn't rat anybody out.

276
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.620
He's like,
I'm not telling on anybody.
So then they're like,
I will fuck you.

277
00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:43.190
So now you're not going to help us out.
We're going to fucking give you,
you know,

278
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.460
the full extent of the law.
We're going to prosecute you.

279
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:50.420
So they gave him 10 years,
the guy gets 10 years.

280
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.940
He's in like a minimum security cause you know,

281
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.000
he didn't really have any violent past or anything.

282
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:58.700
He was just getting people addicted to drugs.
That's all he was doing.

283
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.950
So his dad is devastated and all that shit and he goes to jail.

284
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.950
And uh,
meanwhile the serial killer guys out there killing these girls.

285
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.220
So I'm thinking,
what the fuck went in?
They keep going to commercial meat.

286
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.690
He looked and he said to go and how to fuck?

287
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:16.490
Are they going to tie this fucking thing together?

288
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.330
So long story short,
um,

289
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.490
they ended up catching the serial killer guy.
Uh,
I forget how we fucked up,

290
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:28.640
but they ended up catching him in one of those things where you seem like

291
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:31.910
relieved and all of that type of shit.
And uh,

292
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.940
but he had this thing where he wouldn't admit to all of them.

293
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.940
And if he came at him,
he would just clam up and wouldn't say shit.

294
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:41.840
So he ends up going to jail for like either one or two murders for life.

295
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:43.340
He's never fucking getting out.

296
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.210
So meanwhile there's all these parents whose daughters were killed by this guy

297
00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:49.950
and they don't know where they are and all,
they just wanted us to body,

298
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.090
they want fucking closure.

299
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.240
And these parents are just tortured by this fucking thing.
All right?

300
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.750
So they're trying to figure out,
because he won't talk to them,

301
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.230
he won't tell him anything,
and he's also in denial and he keeps going like,

302
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:03.330
actually I didn't kill him and blah blah blah blah blah.

303
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:06.570
And then one day be like,
oh,
I did and I blacked out.
I don't remember.

304
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:09.540
Like the guy was,
he's a fucking creepy God damn mess.
Right?

305
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.530
So they ended up coming up with this idea that they need a charismatic person to

306
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:21.480
talk to this,
to befriend this serial killer,
gained the guys trust.

307
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:24.150
And maybe he'll tell them where like the bodies are and that type of shit.

308
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.470
So they go to this fucking dude,
Captain America,
you know,

309
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.490
the football player,

310
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:33.660
the movie star looking guy who fucked his whole life up cause he got involved in

311
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:35.010
drugs,
right?

312
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:40.350
And they approach him to go from his minimum security to go into a maximum

313
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:44.760
security prison with his murderers,
rapists,
animals,
fucking maniacs.
Right.

314
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.540
And um,
you know,
to go in there and they said,
if you give,

315
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.910
if you get this information out,

316
00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:53.880
we'll take your sentence and we'll just wipe out.

317
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:56.580
The rest of it will set you free.
He'd already done like three,
four years.

318
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.860
So meanwhile,
Captain America's Dad had a series of strokes,

319
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.410
you know,
and was basically gonna die and he had to go see him.
I mean,

320
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:10.890
it's like a fucking movie.
So he goes,
all right,
fuck it.
I'll,
I'll do it,

321
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.250
but I want it in writing that you're definitely going to let me go.
So they say,

322
00:19:14.251 --> 00:19:18.180
yeah,
so they go out,
right?
He goes,
they go,
here's the deal.

323
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:23.580
We don't want you to approach him for at least six months because he's very

324
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:26.820
cagey in,
if you fucking,
you know,
come out the guy the wrong way.

325
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:30.810
He just fucking walls himself off and that's it.
All right,

326
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.590
so this kid comes wall,
he goes,
then he goes,
fine,
cool.
And he walks in there,

327
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.880
he's like,
I don't have six months.

328
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:39.330
By Dad's going to die within the first two months.
Two,
I'm sorry,

329
00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:44.190
first two hours he goes into the fucking jail
and he fucking,

330
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.053
uh,

331
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:50.090
on purpose accidentally bumps into the guy and then he immediately apologizes.

332
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:53.150
He goes,
Oh,
I'm sorry about that buddy.
I didn't see it standing there.
Hey,

333
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.200
he goes,
I'm new here.
Do you know where the library is?

334
00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.600
And the guy tells him where the library is.
And he goes,
thanks man.
Uh,
you know,

335
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:03.070
and he said something to the effect of a,
yeah,
you're a good guide.

336
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.040
Gives him a little slap on the shoulder.
That's it.

337
00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.030
It goes to the fucking library.
And they set it up where his fucking,

338
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.410
his cell was right across the hall from the other guy.

339
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.900
And he says to them,
he goes,
hey man,
he runs into him again.
Hey,
wait,

340
00:20:16.901 --> 00:20:19.710
he stay in Blah Blah.
It goes on.
It's crazy,
man.
You were right across.

341
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.440
And he said,
it's good to be with a good guy like you,
blah,
blah,
blah,

342
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.760
right across from each other.
And he goes,
uh,

343
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.600
so then fucking the serial killer guy one day he goes,
hey,

344
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:32.610
you want to get lunch with me and my friends?

345
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:36.510
And at this point me and [inaudible] were fucking laughing our balls off going

346
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:39.710
like this kind of social shit happens in prison.
Okay,

347
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.390
y'all are some friends of mine,
uh,

348
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.820
going to have some other murderers and serial killers.
We're going to get some,

349
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:47.330
uh,
maybe get some,
uh,
you know,

350
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.890
[inaudible] a fucking rapper or something.
You want to come down,

351
00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.830
just kind of hang out,
meet you down the commissary.

352
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.670
You always think it's all just getting shanked and try not to get raped,
right?

353
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.050
So he goes,
yeah,
cool.
So long story,
he gains this guy's fucking confidence.

354
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.600
And one time he actually goes in and he sees the guy,

355
00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:08.020
he's got a map with all these red dots on it and all that shit and he's trying

356
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:09.160
to get to it and blah,
blah blah.

357
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.520
So the guy starts opening up any finally ends up telling him this fucking

358
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:17.260
stories,
um,
of all the women that he killed and all of that shit.

359
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.090
And uh,
in sort of kind of mentioned the,

360
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:27.091
gave him like sort of enough information about where the bodies were and the

361
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:32.200
captain America guy kind of fucked up because once he got the information,

362
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:37.201
he thought he had enough information to find all the bodies and get himself out

363
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:41.680
of prison and he just couldn't have all,
wait,
I forgot the best part.
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.950
It's gonna be like a Tarantino movie.
Now we're going to jump backwards.

365
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.760
Another way he gained the guy's confidence was one day they was sitting in the

366
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:50.830
TV room watching TV.

367
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.700
He sit next to this guy and this big fucking giant dude just gets up and turns

368
00:21:57.011 --> 00:22:00.670
the channel
without talking to anybody.

369
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:02.650
And as he turns to channel the serial killer,

370
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:06.100
who was unlike a meek little guy and he just kind of went,

371
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.400
he just sort of said out loud to nobody was like,
Hey,

372
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:14.401
I was watching that like powerlessly really fucking weird psycho thing.

373
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.840
And the fucking captain America Dude walked up to the big dude and knocked him

374
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:22.540
out,
just beat the guy's ass,

375
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:26.380
hit him with an upper cut fucking forearm shiver and just sent this guy flying

376
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:30.760
through some chairs and then they stuck them in the hall.
That's what happened.

377
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.060
And then when he fucking comes out,
tell me,
it doesn't sound like a fucking,

378
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.760
I almost don't even believe it.
So that's when he gained the guy's conference.

379
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:41.080
That's when the dude told him.
And his second,
he tells him this dude,

380
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.950
Captain America couldn't hold it in anymore.
And he goes to do you know what?

381
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:48.010
You're a sick fucking piece of shit,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And flipped out on him.

382
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.150
And then the God,
the CEO kill just backed up and he goes,
he goes,
who sent you?

383
00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:54.730
And he goes,
so and so sent you,
right?
And he named the prosecutor,

384
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:57.850
and then he just fucking disappeared and the map disappeared too.

385
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.740
So then it's like they didn't get the map.
So there was a thing,

386
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:05.560
we don't know where the fucking bodies still are,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

387
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.900
But you got him to admit to these fucking murderers.

388
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.100
So we know that the women are least dead.
The blobby basically in the end,

389
00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:14.000
he did enough where he got out.
Um,

390
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.630
and the whole time we were watching this fucking thing,
we would just go like,

391
00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:21.040
this is a,
this is a fucking movie.

392
00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:23.110
And I guarantee you when they do the fucking movie,

393
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.860
they don't even need to add any mustard to it.
But I guarantee you in the movie,

394
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.620
he won't flip out in the end,
you know,
or free flips out.
But then he somehow,

395
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.020
and then that'll be the last little kick kickup like,
oh no,

396
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:36.490
they didn't find the map in the movie.

397
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:40.330
He'll find the map and then the parents will actually get closure button real

398
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:44.890
life.
You know,
it's not a fucking moving in suck spot.
Isn't that unbelievable?

399
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.960
That like,
uh,
it's so fucking nuts.
Like,

400
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:51.610
at one point they were visiting his old house and he showed,
he goes,
yeah,

401
00:23:51.611 --> 00:23:54.620
he used to live here.
I used to live here and all these cars.

402
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:57.890
I threw like a fucking 20 kegger here one night and he goes up into the room and

403
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:02.180
he shows the secret place where his safe is.
Um,

404
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.310
and you know,
when it was Fort Knox fucking things,
it's just,
I dunno man,

405
00:24:07.311 --> 00:24:11.030
it was fucking,
uh,
an incredible story.
Whatever,
whatever.

406
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:13.520
I know half of them fucking glorifying God damn drug dealer.
Right?

407
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.150
Isn't that what I'm doing?
Um,
and then in the end,

408
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.820
I know you guys wanted a happy ending.

409
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:21.740
There wasn't a happy ending because he fucking,

410
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:24.320
he kind of screwed it up in the end,
but they still let him go though.

411
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.280
Just sort of odd.
Right.
You know what,

412
00:24:29.281 --> 00:24:31.700
this is weird and uncomfortable to watch it this point,
you know,

413
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.430
all these videos they show where there's cops beating up black dudes and all

414
00:24:35.431 --> 00:24:36.510
that type of stuff.
You know,

415
00:24:36.511 --> 00:24:39.330
it's really weird is to watch white kids fucking with cops.

416
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.990
Like I saw one kid was doing this thing where he was drinking a beer where you

417
00:24:42.991 --> 00:24:46.530
weren't supposed to drink a beer.
He did like a magic trick and the cop was,

418
00:24:46.531 --> 00:24:48.600
you can't drink here.
He keeps fucking drink,
keeps drinking.

419
00:24:48.601 --> 00:24:51.690
Then he ends up putting it in the bag and then the fucking bottle disappears.

420
00:24:51.691 --> 00:24:54.540
He was like a magician and it's just like,
you know,

421
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.220
that may be missed the Chappelle show,

422
00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.350
cause he would have done a sketch about that.

423
00:24:58.351 --> 00:25:00.990
And then when it showed the black guy trying to do the same thing where he would

424
00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:04.620
get like a third into the trick and the fucking bottle would be smashed over his

425
00:25:04.621 --> 00:25:08.240
head.
Um,
I dunno.

426
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:12.660
And I usually don't go for that whole fucking,
you know,
if this person does this,

427
00:25:12.661 --> 00:25:15.930
but if that person does that,
I mean,
after seeing some of those videos,

428
00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:20.520
and I'm not saying all cops are bad,
you know,
it's like comedians.

429
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:26.640
You know,
that we're not all hacks.
We don't all have lamp shades on our heads.

430
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.100
We're not all on offstage and have to be the center of attention.
However,

431
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.850
when people think that about it,
I don't about comics,

432
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.440
I don't sit there scratching my head head wondering where that stereotype came

433
00:25:40.441 --> 00:25:44.310
from.
You know what I mean?
That's my only thing with groups of people is like,

434
00:25:44.311 --> 00:25:46.850
you know,
when you're talking about the stereotype,
gee,
people,

435
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.740
it would really help someone who's not in your stereotype.
If you,

436
00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:54.360
if you at least acknowledged where it came from.
Like me,
German,

437
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:57.180
German,
Irish.
So I get Nazi alcoholic,

438
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.990
a fucking lunatic,
right?
Or whatever,

439
00:26:00.991 --> 00:26:05.790
whatever all of it is potato eat and jackass.
Um,

440
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.170
mass murder in psycho.
Now do I like hearing that shit?
I mean,

441
00:26:10.171 --> 00:26:13.160
I guess I don't give a fuck,
but you know,
I,
you know,

442
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.750
it's easy for me to say I don't give a fuck cause it doesn't affect my life.

443
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:19.170
I don't walk into a job interview and they go look at this fucking Nazi Red Eddy

444
00:26:19.171 --> 00:26:24.120
current.
We're not hiring you.
I guess then it would bug me more.
All right.

445
00:26:24.121 --> 00:26:26.640
You know what?
Fuck that whole point.
Fuck that whole point.

446
00:26:26.641 --> 00:26:29.740
I guess I need to listen to people,
but at some point,
you know what I mean?

447
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.920
It was like we have to like nine 11 when they were doing like at the airport

448
00:26:32.921 --> 00:26:35.560
where they were like anybody even remotely look Middle Eastern,

449
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.650
they would just fucking,
you know,
giving him the fucking,
uh,

450
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.340
they giving him the business and then people were getting mad and it's just
like,

451
00:26:42.341 --> 00:26:44.650
are you even going to address?

452
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:46.060
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

453
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.320
<v 1>what the fuck happened?</v>

454
00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.540
You're going to act like you don't know where this is coming from.

455
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.570
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

456
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:56.290
<v 1>3000 people just fucking died.
That was a joke.
I was doing my act.
I was like,</v>

457
00:26:56.291 --> 00:26:56.681
you know what?

458
00:26:56.681 --> 00:27:01.360
In fucking 18 redheads flew to fucking bill planes into the World Trade Center

459
00:27:01.361 --> 00:27:03.850
and knock them down and I went to the airport.
Yeah.

460
00:27:03.851 --> 00:27:06.570
I wouldn't like be and Frist every time,
but I wouldn't be sitting there going,

461
00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.500
I know where it's coming from and at some level,

462
00:27:11.501 --> 00:27:14.770
as much as it would be fucking annoying me that those airport comes with

463
00:27:14.771 --> 00:27:16.960
treating me like that just because of the way that I looked.

464
00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.890
At some point I would address the 18 redheads that fucked it up for me.

465
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:25.030
Fucked it up for me.
Right.
Does that make any sense?
Probably does it.
All right,

466

469
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.800
Why are you torturing yourself with a gross old blade week after week?

470
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:44.140
Probably cause you don't want to shell out 20 bucks for a pack of new ones.

471
00:27:44.141 --> 00:27:44.980
That would be our guests.

You know,

481
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.570

482
00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:20.530
high,
I should say.

495
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.870
nothing dripping down on her fucking thighs.

496
00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:11.590
They also make them for a bunch of guys.
If you go to their websites,

497
00:29:11.591 --> 00:29:15.720
you can look,
oh yeah,

Often under where it gets shipped.

498
00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:20.350
Bulls now it treats them equal.
Yay.
All right,

499
00:29:20.351 --> 00:29:20.921
me undies.

500
00:29:20.921 --> 00:29:24.670
We all know how sexy confidence can be and that confidence comes from being

501
00:29:24.671 --> 00:29:25.504
comfortable.

502
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.830
But how great can you feel if your underwear is wrinkling and writing up?

503
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.060
Yank me undies gets it.

504
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.560
And that's why they've created the world's most comfortable underwear for

505
00:29:35.561 --> 00:29:37.990
regular people.
Cause you know people in the Illuminati,

506
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.190
their balls must just be hovering right for a daily of confidence.

507
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.550
No modal is pronounced modal.

508
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.920
I don't understand why every week,

509
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.400
why they won't fucking show me where the accent is.

510
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.520
[inaudible] put in quotes all lower case m o h Dash Dal modal.

511
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.700
So I'm going to say me undies is made from modal a fairy test twice as soft as

512
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:07.000
cotton.
That's twice as soft as whatever underwear you're wearing right now.

513
00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:10.120
Unless you're in the Illuminati sitting there with you,
goat head,

514
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.810
getting blown by someone wearing a fucking badger costume.

515
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.450
That's the great thing about being an Illuminati,
right?

516
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.490
Every six weeks it's Halloween.

517
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.930
When you meet under that mountain me and he says tons of colors and styles and

518
00:30:22.931 --> 00:30:25.150
the only place to get matching pairs for men and women,

519
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.070
they even release a new design every month.

520
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.090
I wear whatever free pair they give me and my balls have never complained,

521
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.930
never complained.
Plus we all know that paying for shipping sucks so me,

522
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:36.490
and he says,
remove that from the equation.

523
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.250
All orders in the U S and Canada ship for free.

524
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.240
Me undies even has a money back guarantee.
If you know love your first pair,

525
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.010
you get to keep it for free.

526
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:49.780
You literally have nothing to lose other than the free time you'd spent,

527
00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:52.600
you know,
ordering the shit.
There's always something that loose.

528
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.980
Come on me on this.
You know,
I know it.
Don't play dumb with us.
All right?

529
00:30:56.981 --> 00:30:59.560
To sweeten the deals,

532
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.090

534
00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:15.250

What am I got left here?
All right,

535
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:19.270
we're going to do two and two.
All right.
There's the first two.
All right,

536
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.850
let's get back to why did you conk out on me?

537
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.340
Why did the Internet conk out on me?
How dare you?
How dare you?

538
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.410
Um,
and now this won't move.
Why wouldn't you move?

539
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.440
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.
This is how you drag something.
All right,

540
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.670
what do I want to talk about?
Okay.
Or The Bruins.
Hey,
are we go bro,
it's,

541
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.620
here we go.
Bob.
Bob's six O in one.

542
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.490
There's six [inaudible] one.
Basically,
you know what happened?

543
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.240
Not only did they start to get to know each other as players,

544
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.660
I stopped watching them and ever since I haven't been watching,

545
00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:59.020
they've been winning.
Um,
we've gone six oh one one.

546
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.660
The only blemish is when we played the Philadelphia of fly.

547
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:05.770
Yeah.

548
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:10.770
They came back in fucking tied it up and then they closed Zuru one fucking

549
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:12.190
overtime.
But other than that,

550
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:17.191
six Oh one one which you look at that and all dawn Sweeney who I was,

551
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.600
I said at the beginning of the year,
I'm like,
this guy,

552
00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:22.570
the moves this fucking guy made.
All right,

553
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.640
this guy is either going to be

554
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:31.170
the next bill Belicheck or he's going to be fucking run out of town because this

555
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:36.180
guy went all in.
Um,
I,
I,

556
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.830
it's just every fucking thing seems to be falling in place.

557
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:39.920
I know it's really early.

558
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.610
It would be ridiculous for me to get overly excited about this because when they

559
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:48.200
are over all in three,
I didn't freak out.
You know,
I was like,

560
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:49.310
they look in competitive,

561
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:52.760
they just keep fucking up a little bit about halfway through the game.

562
00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:55.220
Then it became the third period now that kind of nailing it down.

563
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.460
So hopefully this is what they're going to be doing.
Um,

564
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.500
but now you know what,
maybe he's more like the Theo Epstein.
I have no idea.

565
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.190
All I know is that we're competitive.
And I was sitting there and looking like,

566
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.420
we're,
we're,
we are,

567
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.400
we're going to lose to the fucking Canadians every game again this year.
And,
uh,

568
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.960
all of a sudden now,
you know,
who knows?
Who knows?
We'll see what happens,
right?

569
00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.080
Lou Cheech got his first goal for the fucking kings.

570
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.990
Still bugs me to see him in that uniform.
Um,
but we got a,

571
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:31.970
we got the Dallas Stars tomorrow night.
Dallas stars,

572
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:35.060
Jamie,
Ben,
Tyler Sagan,
Patrick's shap dude.

573
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:40.061
How many fucking like former Bruins and certainly Blackhawks a plane on number

574
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:44.640
one lines around the fucking league.
Look,
oh,

575
00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.880
look at fucking Winnipeg with Blake.
We

576
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.270
right Blake Wheeler up there in Winnipeg.
We've got Tyler Sagan and fucking,
uh,

577
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.240
Dallas.
I guess Lou isn't playing on the number one line.
Izzy.
No,

578
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:01.010
I don't think he is,
but you know what?

579
00:34:01.011 --> 00:34:04.370
That's the greatest thing about going to daily face off my favorite fucking

580
00:34:04.371 --> 00:34:06.920
website.
Now.
You know,
and they don't,

581
00:34:06.921 --> 00:34:10.880
they don't pay me to advertise for the love of fucking Christ.
Bill.

582
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.310
Can you learn how to drag a God damn window here?
All right.
And they also had,

583
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.190
I didn't realize that fucking Dallas.
Oh,

584
00:34:17.191 --> 00:34:21.860
says Jason spits up from fucking Ottawa is this second line center.
Who Knew?

585
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:23.810
Who knew that?
I didn't know that.

586
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:28.370
Did you know that they one fucking team was I just talking about,

587
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:30.340
do you remember all the kinks?

588
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.940
The Los Angeles Kings Cla cuts.
Where the fuck Outta here we go.

589
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.820
Line combinations.
He is.
He's firstline.

590
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:44.600
Left wing with Jeff Canada and Tyler to Foley.
Oh,

591
00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:49.010
they broke up that seventies.
Like who would have thought they got COPD guitars?

592
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:51.380
The center on the second one right now you're like Jesus Bill,

593
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:55.790
how much hockey are you watching?
I'm not,
I'm not.
I go,
Gee,

594
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:57.560
I just go to daily face off and you look,

595
00:34:57.561 --> 00:35:00.590
you click on line combinations and you can do it.
Jesus.

596
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:05.480
How fucking deeper they their first lines.
Lucita Carter and to Foley.

597
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:10.550
This second line is Pearson,
Copa and Dustin Brown.

598
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.420
Nobody watched the king.
I actually liked the kinks.
Um,

599
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:17.230
unfucking believable,

600
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.770
do anything that makes me happy about seeing the king's is loaded is it makes
me,

601
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.150
it gives me hope that the Canadians will not win a cup again this year even

602
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:30.400
though they're playing fucking great.
Um,
but anyways,

603
00:35:30.401 --> 00:35:34.430
so get the fucking pro it came right back around

604
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.700
and hung in there and I got all those games tapes,

605
00:35:37.701 --> 00:35:40.590
so I got to watch him and I'm ridiculously excited to watch

606
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.930
the Dallas Stars game because,
uh,
they're fucking,
uh,
you know,

607
00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.030
they're one of the best teams.
All of a sudden.

608
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.650
I've always been a fan of green and white Kumanti.
I'm a Celtics fan.
Right.
Um,

609
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.970
so anyways,
let me,
uh,
let me plow ahead here.

610
00:35:55.971 --> 00:35:59.820
Another great thing that I did while I was out in Chicago is I went to arguably

611
00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:03.750
the greatest drum shop in the country,
uh,
fixed drum shop.

612
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.610
And um,

613
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.500
it is just basically giant.

614
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:15.420
It's a combination drum shop and like studio space.

615
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.690
And I lost track.
I think there's like four floors to it.

616
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.890
And it almost looked like what it used to be is you know like the one of those

617
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:27.240
places you just storage space,
you know all those things are really weird.

618
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:31.080
Like the way they set them up and as those narrow hallways and you walk down

619
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:32.820
them,
there's all of that type of stuff.

620
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:37.470
So he kept all the rooms and he just sort of combined rooms and put in windows

621
00:36:37.471 --> 00:36:42.471
so you could see through and he has like just this symbol room we just had like

622
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:44.970
fucking any,
he has like total anal,

623
00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:48.690
like he has every fucking high hat you could think of and he has them in

624
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:52.200
alphabetical order.
So I don't know all the drum names,

625
00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:55.890
but he starts with like DW and then it ends with Yamaha.

626
00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.160
Every fucking kind you could possibly ever fucking want the remote,

627
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.620
the remote cabled ones,
everyone you can think of.

628
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.610
He had this dww pedal that I had never even fucking seen before.

629
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.530
They look like a piece of jewelry,

630
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.400
but I in glass he had another area where it was just all a all acoustic drums.

631
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.180
Then he had this whole area that was all a electronic drums

632
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.160
he had upstairs.
He had these two monster fucking kits,

633
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:31.290
like a Terry Terry Bozzio type shit.

634
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.180
I went over there with a friend of mine.

635
00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:38.160
He let her play on and let me play on it.
It was just,
it was fucking insane,

636
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.950
was fucking insane.
And um,
and I went into one of his drum rooms.

637
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.420
It's nice and clean.
The drums were all tuned up.
They sounded fucking great.

638
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.770
And what killed me is I could have been going down there every fucking day

639
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:58.190
playing drums when I was in Chicago instead of being laid up fucking hell.

640
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.290
I go,
I got so drunk at the Liar's club with,

641
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:07.560
and if you think I'm not going back there again and doing nine shots and
dancing,

642
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:10.010
the ACDC,
it's over.
Like I tell you right now,

643
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.600
fixed drum shop and fucking lives club.
I'm,

644
00:38:12.601 --> 00:38:15.720
I'm hitting those every time I go to town.
Um,

645
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.670
all little next time I'm going to bring the lovely Nia,
you know,
uh,
Chicago is a,

646
00:38:20.671 --> 00:38:22.630
um,
that's a,

647
00:38:22.631 --> 00:38:26.550
see I got all kinds of family out there and you know,
one of the big things,

648
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:30.990
all the men on both sides of my families would always take their wives down to

649
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:35.710
Michigan Avenue,
buy shoes or whatever,
like throughout all of the last century.

650
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.760
So,
uh,
that's something that I have to do at some point.
I gotta take,

651
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.510
I gotta take me it down there and buy or something.
But um,

652
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.840
I could not have had a better time than I have to tell you right now.

653
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:49.600
If you were fucking drummer,
I don't give a fuck where you live.

654
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.770
If you're anywhere,
they're in the Midwest.
If you're in fucking de Moines,

655
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.650
I don't want to hear your bitching about the fucking,
the ride.

656
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.440
Like if you're going to make a major purchase,

657
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.490
if you're going to go buy a bunch of new symbols and all of that type of shit,

658
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:07.710
I'm telling you,
getting your fucking car drive to Chicago,
go to Vicks.

659
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.830
And I'm telling you,
the guy,

660
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:13.831
he has everything he had Zildjian had Sabian it pastes pipe pasty.

661
00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:16.480
Pasty.
Why we say that?
Mine only had fucking,

662
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:21.250
he had an all every fucking high had just,
it was insane.

663
00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.210
It was fucking,
it was actually like,
and he was going over,

664
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:28.090
he had a percussion room.
He was,

665
00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:32.110
he was going over the whole fucking thing.
It was like,

666
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.050
it was like sensory overload.
I almost had to try to be like,

667
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.960
he had like a whole fucking all,
all these snares.

668
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.880
This whole room was just all snare drums.

669
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.660
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of fucking it.

670
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.750
The amount of money this guy has invested in just the functions to be carrying

671
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.850
that,
that amount of inventory and other cool thing he had,

672
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:55.060
he had a whole tabletop,
this giant table,

673
00:39:55.061 --> 00:39:59.470
almost like an island that you'd have in like a big kitchen.
The whole,

674
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.830
the whole tabletop.
The surface was made out of that material.

675
00:40:02.831 --> 00:40:04.060
That's a practice pad.

676
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.920
So like literally like 20 drummers could stand around it and I'll be just trying

677
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:10.960
out sticks.
And that was a course in the stick from,

678
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.190
I can't even like the whole fucking thing was just,

679
00:40:15.191 --> 00:40:16.440
it was just from top to bottom.

680
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.470
It was mostly the same fucking place I've ever been to.
And I was just like,

681
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:23.620
hey man,
I wanted to play,
you know,
if I want to,
how much do you for studio time,

682
00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:27.580
he's like,
Hey,
like 15 bucks for an hour.
I can go play in a kit,

683
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.520
you know,
while I'm on the fucking road.

684
00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:32.140
That would have been the greatest thing ever.
So that's,

685
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:37.000
that's my one regret is that I didn't do that three days in a row and get three

686
00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:40.390
hours better on drums or who's kidding who I probably had gone there for too.

687
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.980
You gotta you gotta do at least two,
right?

688
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.860
The first hours practicing all the shit you suck at.

689
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.130
And then the second hour is just playing into all your favorite songs.

690
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.370
Fantasizing that you're in the bed.
I don't think that's weird.

691
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.450
I think that's normal for me to do.
Pushing 50 years of age.

692
00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.930
So anyway,
so I got the big Philly Gig,

693
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.460
the big Philly gig coming up this weekend and a Friday night.

694
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:12.040
And um,
I was going to be me,
Paul Versey and Joe Matter Reece,

695
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.420
Joe Matter,
Reese Philly native and um,
we're going to be coming in there.

696
00:41:16.421 --> 00:41:21.421
So I've been asking the good people of Philly where I should go to get my

697
00:41:21.881 --> 00:41:26.540
fucking cheese steak,
you know,
cause tourists like me,
uh,

698
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.050
go down to genomes and the other fucking place,
whatever they are.

699
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:33.220
So I've been getting all these ideas from people and the overwhelming winner.

700
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.090
All right,
this is like an election.

701
00:41:36.091 --> 00:41:38.860
So you get to know who's winning and if you guys think I'm making a mistake,

702
00:41:38.861 --> 00:41:40.110
he got to send me a tweet.

703
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:45.580
The overwhelming winner as far as,
um,

704
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.760
not going to those two places is,

705
00:41:47.761 --> 00:41:52.760
is John's roast pork and Philly nine.
All right?

706
00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:55.710
Now everybody you'd fill either went like nuts,
like yes,

707
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.950
I should say people from Philly listening to this either went like psych,

708
00:42:01.951 --> 00:42:04.620
then I'm going there or then I'm going to get a bunch.
Dot.

709
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.140
I'll fucking go there and play soccer.
So overrated.

710
00:42:08.141 --> 00:42:12.000
I went dead and we fucking dry.
So John's roast pork,
Philly.

711
00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.700
I mean that sounds delicious.
So I think that that's where I'm going to go.

712
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.600
That's where I'm going to go after the show.
I'm going to go over there.

713
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:25.070
I'm going to stand in fucking line.
As of right now,
unless somebody tells me,

714
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:29.300
unless enough people tell me differently,
that's where the fuck I'm going.
Um,

715
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:33.480
that's where the after party is going to be.

716
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:36.450
I'm going to go out and get a fucking cheese steak and you know what?

717
00:42:36.451 --> 00:42:40.260
I can't fucking wait.
I can't fucking wait.
That's going to be great.

718
00:42:40.261 --> 00:42:44.820
I just fast forward in my life.
Um,
so anyways,

719
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.460
but like I said,
I'm going to try to be a good boy here.

720
00:42:47.461 --> 00:42:51.270
This whole week I'm going to be working out and doing all that type of shit.

721
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:52.560
I got to get my ass back in shape.

722
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.980
I put it on probably like seven or eight pounds over two weeks,

723
00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.560
maybe not that much of weight.
It just feels like I did.

724
00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.920
But you know what I'm going to while I'm in town and for a good four or five

725
00:43:01.921 --> 00:43:05.280
days before I have to go back out again and I'm just going to eat perfectly and

726
00:43:05.281 --> 00:43:09.440
work out this what the fuck I'm going to do.
That's one I'm going do.
And uh,

727
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:13.890
I think just from just literally not drinking at this point,
uh,

728
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.860
that alone will be enough for me to drop a couple this week.

729
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.590
So if I drop a good for,
you know,
three,
four before I do,
uh,
uh,

730
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:26.550
Madison Square Garden when I should be happy.
Right.
Um,
all right,

731
00:43:26.551 --> 00:43:29.430
so there you go.
So that's the,
uh,
oh.

732
00:43:29.431 --> 00:43:31.890
Did anybody see that fucking giant saints game?

733
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.220
Did you see the giant Saints Games when I was fucking insane games ever seen in

734
00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:38.760
my life?
One quarterback throws for seven drew Brees,

735
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.710
Eli throws for fucking six.
Did you just fucking,
you want to see it?

736
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.950
You don't want,
every time I watched the giant says something that reminds me,

737
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:50.700
not every time,
but a lot of times it reminds me of losing Superbowls to them.

738
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:55.180
That fucking drive that they had the football gods love Eli.

739
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.010
I don't ever want to see that guy again in the playoffs.

740
00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:03.810
He fucking comes down the field,
right?
Dead.
They're threatened.

741
00:44:03.811 --> 00:44:08.030
They're down by what were they down?
But they have down by 14 at that.
Yeah.
Okay.

742
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.000
It's like 42 28 nobody had even attempted a fucking field goal at that point.

743
00:44:13.001 --> 00:44:16.210
I believe so.
Probably hadn't punted either.

744
00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:22.030
So they fucking,
uh,
whatever they call a pass play,
he drops back to pass.

745
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:26.530
Somebody comes right up the middle fucking drills a guy,
he fumbles the ball.

746
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.500
Saints recover.
There's like 13 minutes left at 12 left.

747
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.300
It's not the nail in the coffin,

748
00:44:33.301 --> 00:44:38.301
but like if the saints drive down and fucking score a touchdown or even kick a

749
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:39.690
fucking field goal,

750
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.560
the three scores up with probably nine minutes left.

751
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.340
They are ridiculously comfortable at that point.
All right.

752
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.420
The defense would probably be the little deflated because they sense it to,

753
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.380
the saints will be on their toes,
you know,
healthy.
That's just a game changer.

754
00:44:55.381 --> 00:45:00.180
Right?
Football,
gods step in
football,

755
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:04.470
gods step in once again.
And they called some ticky tack Horse Shit.

756
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:09.720
Fucking a defensive holding right on the saints,

757
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.860
which gives the fucking uh,

758
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.750
giants the ball back and keeps the drive going.

759
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.180
Gives them like a fucking first down.

760
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.330
They get all the way down to the end there on the goal line.

761
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.240
Eli goes back to pass here,

762
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:27.150
comes to fucking rush and he's rolling out and they should have sacked them,

763
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:29.640
but they didn't.
These rolling out and I know it's going to happen.

764
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.820
He's going to throw the ball and somehow it's going to land in some giant,

765
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.890
giant hands.
So he throws the ball back across his body running right,

766
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:41.340
throws it back,
left with barely anything on it.

767
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:45.360
Classic Brett Farve six interception,

768
00:45:45.361 --> 00:45:50.220
game throw throws the fucking thing.
It's going to be a pick.

769
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.480
But the guy in the sates,
ms times is jump,

770
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.550
gets hit by another St,

771
00:45:56.551 --> 00:46:01.551
lands on his fucking head and gets a concussion and this fucking duck just lands

772
00:46:01.861 --> 00:46:06.840
into the hands of a giant for a touchdown.
I've never seen a guy,

773
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.100
the the horse shoe that is up to this guy's fucking ass.
I just,
I do like that.

774
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.220
I was like that.
That right there.
If we played them again,

775
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.700
that's how we will lose,
will lose to them just like that.

776
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.890
Exactly.
To a fucking T.
I don't know what it is.
He hated.

777
00:46:22.891 --> 00:46:25.980
That guy has the fucking magic and there's nothing too,

778
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:30.060
now that I'm saying this and being a whiny cunt fucking Patriot fan,

779
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:35.220
that guy also made some some fucking sick ass throws.
He's definitely,
I'm,
I'm,

780
00:46:35.221 --> 00:46:37.770
I'm not sure where to go.
I fucking love him.
I think he's the shit,

781
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:42.771
but I've never seen a guy fuck up so many times and in and does not pay the

782
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:44.640
price for it.

783
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.080
Maybe I need to watch your more or maybe I'm still just so fucking rattled from

784
00:46:49.081 --> 00:46:53.490
those two fucking,
oh my God.
We love when we were undefeated,
when he threw,

785
00:46:53.491 --> 00:46:56.760
he threw a pick to a Sunday Samuel and hit him in both hands.

786
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.280
The guy just drops it.
Then he throws behind his fucking receiver.

787
00:47:02.281 --> 00:47:06.660
The guy reaches back over the Patriot guys arm and catches it with his hand in

788
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:09.270
his helmet.
Fucking,
I mean,

789
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:12.420
just anybody else said be an incomplete pass.

790
00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:17.190
You fucked up as a quarterback or it would be,
it'd be a pick.
I'm telling you,

791
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:21.120
I,
I've,
I've never fucking seen it.
It's just,
it's insane.

792
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.400
I never want to see that guy.

793
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.700
If we played the giants and the Superbowl this year,
I'm telling you right now,

794
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:27.690
I'm not going to watch it.

795
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.720
Or I'll watch the first three quarters and then I'm just walking away and I'm

796
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:36.520
going to stand outside my party and just waiting for the screams of agony.

797
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.310
I know it's going to happen.
When that happens,
I'm just going to fucking,

798
00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.770
I'm just going to walk away when to walk away.

799
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:47.490
I'm not going to watch ESPN for like a month.
The I,
you know,

800
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:49.660
I might even take a month off from my podcast.

801
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.620
I didn't even want to fucking see it.
I'm telling you this guy,
he sold his soul.

802
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.110
Something happened.
Isn't that right?
Cleo?
Give me,

803
00:47:56.111 --> 00:47:59.110
I can only have buddy get up on the couch.

804
00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.190
What did he say to him?
What'd he say?

805
00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:05.653
I want to hear it.

806
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.790
You never do the fucking moment.
I give you that hug.
She does this thing.
Come up.

807
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:17.380
She gave her a hug.
She goes,
you stink buddy.

808
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:20.980
You know that I'm going to give you a bass.
You want a bath?

809
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.390
Now there's the look.
Why don't dogs like get baths?
You know what I mean?

810
00:48:25.391 --> 00:48:28.840
They hate the process,
but then afterwards they fucking freak out.

811
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.620
I can't tell if it's because they feel good to,
they just psyched that it's over.

812
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:36.190
But it's almost like watching a junkie.
Just keep using rather than just going,

813
00:48:36.191 --> 00:48:37.930
if you just go through a little bit of misery,

814
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:42.400
you know you're going to be all right,
huh?
Wow.

815
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.650
All right,
let's read some letters.
Clearly you want to chime in on some of these?

816
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.620
All right.
Cross country lady.
Um,

817
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.150
and it may can get knee up here.
She hasn't done the podcast in a minute.

818
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:59.920
Hang on one second.
Hold on.
Well,
no such luck.
I thought she was downstairs.

819
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:04.570
Where is she clear?
All right.
Cross country lady a bill.

820
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:08.020
I'm a 25 year old girl.
You're a woman,

821
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:10.610
you're a lady.
Um,

822
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:15.130
pretty responsible and competent and don't wind like some broads over there.

823
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.610
I'm not one of those girls who can say they know how to change a tire,

824
00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:22.660
but I've done enough that I think I could if I had to.
Yeah,
he can change a tire.

825
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.450
You got to change the time,
but she didn't.

826
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:29.170
Nobody can change a fucking tire with the factory Jack that the Jack handle it.

827
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:32.080
They give you,
you can't get enough fucking talk unless you just some fucking,

828
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.330
he got those Popeye forearms,

829
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.290
which you really need is you just need a little piece of pipe and you can stick

830
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:42.310
over.
You know,
you loosen the lug swell,

831
00:49:42.311 --> 00:49:45.790
it's still on the ground.
Denny's.
You go to jack it up,

832
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:49.210
you sticky spare underneath the tire and then eat the fucking frame in case it

833
00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:52.120
comes crashing down.
That's supposed to save you,
but the fucking thing,

834
00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:56.020
so God damned small now it doesn't matter.
All right?
You take the fucker off.

835
00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:58.420
She put the new one on.
All right.

836
00:49:58.421 --> 00:50:01.270
You put all the fucking lugs on that.

837
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:04.330
You put in your pocket or in a place he didn't,
none of them rolled away.

838
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:07.870
And then you lower the car back down and then you tighten and you go,

839
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:12.160
it's easiest fucking thing ever.
Right.
All right.
That's the attitude,
right?

840
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:15.370
A on us,
somewhat related,
but unrelated note,

841
00:50:15.371 --> 00:50:20.371
I'm looking to drive across the country now moving to Los Angeles from Rhode

842
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:22.570
Island.
My parents are cool and trust me,

843
00:50:22.571 --> 00:50:27.570
but they have their concerns about me driving by myself.
Yeah,
absolutely.
You've,

844
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.140
you've seen this great country from all your touring.

845
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.610
I suspect early on in your comedy career there was more driving than flying.

846
00:50:34.611 --> 00:50:39.050
Absolutely.
There was a,
do you have any advice or warnings against me doing so?

847
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.770
I would take a week or so and pick out some different stops.

848
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.070
I drive a 2003 black Volvo station wagon.
It's ready to go.
So my,

849
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.970
what are your thoughts?
Uh,
ps,
thanks for checking in on us on Thursday.

850
00:50:52.971 --> 00:50:57.140
It really means a lot.
Um,
all right.
What would my advice be?
Uh,

851
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:58.130
my advice,

852
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:04.370
my advice would actually be to maybe do it with somebody else just because,

853
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:09.320
um,
especially depends on where you're staying.
You know,

854
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.300
as a woman going out there by yourself,
I would definitely stay at nice hotels,

855
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:20.000
enough underground parking,
uh,
you know,
just really well lit places.

856
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.050
Don't do what I did where I'd fuck it.

857
00:51:22.051 --> 00:51:25.710
I drove across country in about two and a half days,
one time for my team,

858
00:51:25.711 --> 00:51:26.780
my big square,

859
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:31.640
1990s TV in the back and I would just pull up to shitty hotels and I would just

860
00:51:31.641 --> 00:51:36.641
sleep in the car cause I didn't want to drag all my shit out of the car into the

861
00:51:37.221 --> 00:51:40.730
thing.
So I just slept there.
Like what fucking idiot?

862
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.360
Someone who sort of broke the window.
By the time I figured up,

863
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:46.670
realize what was going on,
my throat would have been slipped,
so I would,

864
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.340
I would do it with somebody else.
Um,
if you're going to go during the wintertime,

865
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.840
you want to get south as quick as you can.
Um,

866
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:58.750
maybe go across the 48.
Nina,
you want to come on the podcast?
Oh,

867
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.700
you eat breakfast.
Can you say hello to everybody?
All right.

868
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:06.493
Um,

869
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:12.050
so I would maybe do the 40 as opposed to the 70.
Um,

870
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.960
70 is beautiful when you drive across.
Uh,
I believe that I won.
It goes,

871
00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.350
they'll actually go south of Pittsburgh.
But you go through,
um,

872
00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:26.150
like I actually,
my favorite part of the 70s actually when you first pick it up,

873
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.860
I set the 15,
the 15 goes up and meets the 70 from the west.
Well,

874
00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.710
why don't you take a fucking map out going through Utah.

875
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:39.000
Um,
wait,
I got to reread it.
You in Los Angeles?
Yeah.

876
00:52:39.001 --> 00:52:42.680
So if you take the 70 across,
going through Utah,

877
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:44.540
going through Vegas,

878
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:50.130
going through the rocky mountains is amazing tunnel that you drive through.
Um,

879
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.490
as you get out towards grand junction and all of that,

880
00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.670
I will tell you what is a motherfucker is after a,
I mean,

881
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:57.490
you got to do the thing where you,
you're,

882
00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:03.410
you go through St Louis.
You know,
when you see the arch,
that's the shit.

883
00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.180
Um,
and it's cool,
right?
Until you get to Kansas City,
stop at Kansas City,

884
00:53:08.181 --> 00:53:12.860
get yourself some barbecue and then just fucking settle in because Kansas is a

885
00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:15.440
motherfucker.
Um,

886
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:20.030
that's a motherfucker trying to get through that thing.
Uh,
although,
you know,

887
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:23.420
if the Jayhawks have a game,
I'd stop baby.
I,
yeah,

888
00:53:23.421 --> 00:53:27.190
if he figured out shit that you want to do the way you could have a great time,

889
00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:31.060
but I gotta be honest with you,
a few of my sister or my,
my daughter or whatever,

890
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:33.930
I would not want you doing it by yourself.
Um,

891
00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.220
but if you are going to do it by yourself,

892
00:53:36.221 --> 00:53:40.600
just make sure you stay in safe places.
Keep your head on a fucking swivel.

893
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.070
And I would also,
uh,
the second you get tired,

894
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:50.290
pull over.
I mean,
get to your destination.
Don't do the dumb shit that I did.

895
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:53.290
Well,
you're almost like hallucinating.
I got a buddy of mine,

896
00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:56.290
a comedian told me his story.
He's the one that cured me of it.

897
00:53:56.291 --> 00:53:58.970
He was fucking driving to the airport,
nod,

898
00:53:58.971 --> 00:54:03.460
nod like early in the morning and next thing he wrote,
he woke up,

899
00:54:03.461 --> 00:54:04.870
he was laying in a field,

900
00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:10.890
he got thrown from the fucking car and somehow just landed in the field and was

901
00:54:10.901 --> 00:54:14.830
okay.
And uh,
he wasn't wearing a seatbelt obviously,

902
00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:19.700
by the way.
Did you guys see that kid out here in Los Angeles?
It's a poor kid.

903
00:54:19.701 --> 00:54:24.280
Like 20 years old was driving lost control of his car.
The thing was rolling.

904
00:54:24.281 --> 00:54:29.260
He got rejected out of the car and you know those signs on the freeway that the

905
00:54:29.261 --> 00:54:33.250
trucks,
that 18 wheelers can drive underneath without hitting.
He went up,

906
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.930
he hit that thing and landed.
You know,

907
00:54:34.931 --> 00:54:38.740
sometimes they have like a little walkway up there.
His body landed up there.

908
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.640
Um,
so I would say be careful.
Definitely be careful.
Um,

909
00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:50.950
what the fuck is all the rest of the questions here
for this week?

910
00:54:50.951 --> 00:54:55.810
That's what I would say.
Oh,
look who's here.
It's decided to show up.

911
00:54:55.811 --> 00:54:58.990
Cleo for the love of fucking Christ.
Are you going to do that every,
every week?

912
00:54:58.991 --> 00:55:03.040
I can't get to the podcast without the thing you just love on plugging.
Shit.

913
00:55:03.041 --> 00:55:07.690
Don't yet.
All right.
Come in.
And he helped me with these last few,
uh,

914
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:12.330
these last few questions.
I don't know what just happened to him.

915
00:55:12.331 --> 00:55:16.360
I had a bunch of questions and they all went away.
It live or ease content?

916
00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:18.370
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

917
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:22.660
<v 1>Oh,
I don't even know when that one was from.
All right.
Here we go.
Royals.</v>

918
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.700
You don't want to talk sports to you.
Can you grab another microphone though?

919
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.550
Yeah.
Hang on.
Let's see here.

920
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:36.220
You can plug it in here.
Can you grab a microphone and I'll plug it in?

921
00:55:36.221 --> 00:55:39.640
I think it's somewhere in my bag.
Either that,
yeah,

922
00:55:39.641 --> 00:55:44.500
we'll probably have to share one.
Sorry.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Hang on.

923
00:55:44.501 --> 00:55:47.870
Hang on.
Sorry.
Plugging in.
Plugging in.

924
00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:56.250
All right.
What the magic of the pause button.
Here we go.
All right.
Yeah,

925
00:55:56.390 --> 00:56:00.020
we're going to talk sports with you.
Oh,
Goodie.
The royals.
Where are they from?

926
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:04.280
Cincinnati.
Nope.
Wait,
good guests.

927
00:56:04.281 --> 00:56:06.980
So it's one of those cities,

928
00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:12.870
one of those be so called b-level cities.
I don't know.
Wait,
wait.

929
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:18.020
Uh,
no,
no.
I don't know.
They have great barbecue,
Kansas City Ram,

930
00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.670
Billy Bass.
I know you're touring and you didn't get to see much baseball,

931
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:24.180
but I just want to say how much

932
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:27.750
<v 5>I like Harold Reynolds.
You know how Ron and joy,</v>

933
00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.200
it's a huge difference having a guy who can explain baseball.

934
00:56:31.201 --> 00:56:34.350
I know baseball but uh,
it's the insight you want to hear.

935
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:38.070
This was a great world series.
Don't know what the ratings were,

936
00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.170
but this was the best baseball I've seen in a while.

937
00:56:40.171 --> 00:56:43.770
Despite the fact that the mets were lucky to be there based on their record and

938
00:56:43.771 --> 00:56:46.190
slow start to the season of what the fuck does that mean?

939
00:56:46.191 --> 00:56:49.400
What do mean lucky to be there?
You don't get lucky getting in the world series.

940
00:56:49.401 --> 00:56:52.920
You won the game.
She had to win.
The royals played really excited.

941
00:56:52.921 --> 00:56:56.040
Baseball hits are more fun than home runs any day.

942
00:56:56.041 --> 00:56:58.910
Thanks for the podcast already.
Cause he's just saying he likes Harold Reynolds.

943
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.340
That's really not a question.
Um,
no.
I was like,
you know,

944
00:57:02.341 --> 00:57:06.150
it was really cool was of course you know this to see George Brett excited like

945
00:57:06.151 --> 00:57:07.860
a fan when he saw them all run out,

946
00:57:07.861 --> 00:57:12.660
you know the Great George Brett last go came the closest to hitting 400.
Okay.

947
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:16.290
You had 400,
like through August almost.
He ended up with at three 90.

948
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.580
I'm all right.
How old were you drama.
Here we go.
Nina,
you are home for Halloween.

949
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:25.740
Yes.
I was uh,
Bill
really bringing it this week.

950
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.940
You got to really bring it.
You didn't get any breakfast.
Yes,
I was.

951
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.890
Halloween is a date in October.
Yes it is.
All right,
Bill,

952
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.090
I'll cut right to the chase.

953
00:57:36.091 --> 00:57:39.390
I was at a Halloween party and naturally tons of girls were dressed scantily

954
00:57:39.391 --> 00:57:40.224
clad.

955
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:44.520
My girlfriend's costume though a though a bit revealing was extremely tasteful

956
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:45.750
compared to other brands.

957
00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:50.430
So I see this dude taking pictures of girls asses and just being a creep about

958
00:57:50.431 --> 00:57:53.580
it.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.
So I look at him as if to say,

959
00:57:53.581 --> 00:57:56.820
what the fuck are you doing?
He just walked away a couple minutes later.

960
00:57:56.821 --> 00:58:01.620
I see him snapping a picture that was framing my girlfriend's tits,
lb.
It,

961
00:58:01.621 --> 00:58:05.720
they were covered and not hanging out.
It was a creek still a creep move.
Yeah.

962
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:09.810
So I stepped in front of him and confronted him.
Yup.
He said it's a party.

963
00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.910
Everyone's,
everyone takes pictures.

964
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:15.780
A couple people looked at me funny like I was an over protective Douche.

965
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:20.880
What's nothing is I opened my mouth before it even involved my girlfriend.

966
00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.870
Did I do something wrong?
Of course not.

967
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:27.690
Well and that's the thing about it.

968
00:58:27.691 --> 00:58:32.610
It's like I feel like it's women can say over and over again,

969
00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:35.330
don't take pictures of me,
you know,
stop leering at me.

970
00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:38.370
Stop being a fucking disgusting,
perverted creep.

971
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.660
But it's going to take guys like you and other guys to say to other guys like

972
00:58:42.661 --> 00:58:43.321
that's not cool.

973
00:58:43.321 --> 00:58:46.260
That's not taking pictures of these girls unless they were like posing for

974
00:58:46.261 --> 00:58:50.490
pictures for you.
Right.
I think I just of my girlfriend don't do that.

975
00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:53.190
I don't care if it's a party.
I don't care.
That happens to me.

976
00:58:53.191 --> 00:58:57.180
One time I went to some bar or club or something and I was dancing with my

977
00:58:57.181 --> 00:59:01.500
girlfriends and this dude came and was like trying to video the entire thing of

978
00:59:01.501 --> 00:59:03.060
us dancing together and I was like,

979
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:05.580
I just stopped and I put my hand in front of his face and I was like,

980
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:08.200
don't do that.
He was like,
Ooh,
fruity know about my,

981
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.830
everyone's just like taking pictures.
It's cool,
it's cool.
I said,
no,

982
00:59:10.831 --> 00:59:13.260
it's not cool.
You're not allowed to take pictures of me.

983
00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:14.640
Stop taking pictures of me.

984
00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:17.820
And then finally he just kind of like turned away and I'm sure he'd go when your

985
00:59:17.821 --> 00:59:20.450
own problem.
And he actually is a lot,
but you still just tell him,

986
00:59:20.451 --> 00:59:23.670
even though he allowed,
he's allowed you if you want,
you're in public,

987
00:59:23.671 --> 00:59:27.660
you're considered in public and it's,
it's on you,
but it doesn't make it okay.

988
00:59:27.661 --> 00:59:30.580
It's the new cell phone Aaronia it,
it's,
it's,
it's,

989
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:35.040
there's no rule that says you're allowed to just take me out.
There's no rules.

990
00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:39.320
Say we can't,
do we need to talk about,
sorry,

991
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:42.320
I knocked the plug out.
We're back here.
Here's the thing,

992
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:46.010
like with cell phones now,
like all of that type,

993
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:47.720
so you can tell somebody not to do it,

994
00:59:47.721 --> 00:59:51.950
but they can't be prosecuted or anything for doing it.
Once you're out in public,

995
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:56.180
uh,
you're considered in public and people can take pictures of you.

996
00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:57.830
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

997
00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.380
<v 5>Like the Paparazzi,
they just follow famous people around.</v>

998
01:00:00.381 --> 01:00:02.000
They take fucking pictures of him,
everything.

999
01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:07.180
They can't go like into their house or go onto their property.

1000
01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:10.280
Then they're considered trespassing.
But the second you walk out there,

1001
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.050
we as my question,
yeah.
I don't think,

1002
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:15.260
obviously I don't think that someone should fucking take pictures.

1003
01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:19.130
That's definitely creepy.
But as far as the leering thing goes,

1004
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.120
do you think women have any responsibility as far as if you're going to go out

1005
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:26.180
there and dress suggestively aren't,

1006
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.460
do they have any responsibility?

1007
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.960
I think that if you go out and you're dressed in a revealing way,

1008
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.380
I think yes,
of course.
Naturally people are going to look at you,

1009
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:45.220
but it doesn't give anybody the right to say nasty things to you or to touch you

1010
01:00:46.491 --> 01:00:49.100
or to think that they just have,
I'm not talking about touching.

1011
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:54.200
I'm just saying somebody staring at you.
See I knew you were going to get mad.
No,

1012
01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:56.120
I knew you were gonna get mad.
I'm just saying like it's,

1013
01:00:56.121 --> 01:01:00.710
it's like you do if you don't want that to happen to you.

1014
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.520
Right.
And this is Kinda what,
whenever the fuck I want to wear,

1015
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.780
that's the bottom line.
I can walk down the street,
make wearing a fucking suit,

1016
01:01:08.781 --> 01:01:11.630
made out a dollar bills and then when I get hit over the head and mugged,

1017
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:14.140
I'm going to be like,
I should be allowed to blah blah blah.

1018
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.710
There's like the way nobody who wished the world could be and the way it really

1019
01:01:18.711 --> 01:01:19.544
is.
I agree.

1020
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:23.480
But I don't think that anyone should feel like they have access to you on those

1021
01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:27.470
levels just because of what you're wearing.
It's still not right.
Absolutely.

1022
01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:30.770
It's not right.
But my fucking name,
the same thing.
I know,
but my thing is,

1023
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:35.780
is you know that there's creeps out there,
you know,
that does animals out there.

1024
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:40.310
Why would you put yourself in the crosshairs of them?
Because I,
well,

1025
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:41.930
because it's not about them.

1026
01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.650
It's about what has about you or the personal you hair.
Yeah.

1027
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.490
And so if I want to go out and wear something sexy cause I'm feeling myself,

1028
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:51.050
then I'll go out and wear something sexy.

1029
01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:54.260
And I would expect that people would look at me.
Sure.

1030
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.220
But what I expect them to start like taking pictures and shit.
Nah,

1031
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.120
I'm not saying pictures.

1032
01:01:59.121 --> 01:02:03.500
I'm saying the leering thing like as a guy at all,

1033
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:07.640
you're going to get looks on the guy's side of it is when a woman shows up with

1034
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:12.020
their tits hanging out.
Okay.
And you look at her tits and then she gets mad.

1035
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:15.440
We're always like,
well fucking put them away.
And then it's always like,

1036
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:20.030
well I should have a right to have my tits out there,
my tits,
you know?

1037
01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:23.240
And then we get yelled at like where these fucking lunatics.

1038
01:02:23.241 --> 01:02:27.740
And it's almost like,
like that input in policing that's like entrapment.
Well,

1039
01:02:27.741 --> 01:02:30.860
I think there's,
well first of all,
no one's fucking thinking about you.
All right.

1040
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:35.850
You're not fucking Marion Barry.
This is an entrapment.
Okay.
So yes,
look,

1041
01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.250
not the ceviche manning their leg the entire time.

1042
01:02:40.251 --> 01:02:44.210
It's like I start feeling fucking creeped out and weirded out and unsafe.

1043
01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.670
So have your look and keep it moving.
Okay.
So that's definitely fair.

1044
01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.720
Have your look and keep it moving.
I love it.
That's the rule.

1045
01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.920
So let me ask you this,

1046
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:56.140
but don't try to invade my space and try to get into my head and all that kind

1047
01:02:56.141 --> 01:02:59.690
of shit.
Like don't do that.
Have your look.
Keep it moving.
All right,

1048
01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.300
here's my question for you.
What's the difference?

1049
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:05.380
What's the time we will put a shot clock on this.
You know,

1050
01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.730
in the NBA he got a 24 second shot clock.

1051
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:10.620
The difference between having your look and lyric,

1052
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.840
how many seconds before you're a shot clock violation.

1053
01:03:14.841 --> 01:03:19.070
He had turned over the ball.
Um,
I think anything beyond,

1054
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:20.940
<v 3>okay,</v>

1055
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.560
<v 5>five seconds.
Five seconds is a great look.
Yeah,</v>

1056
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:29.750
five seconds.
Should do it.
The old up and down.
Hmm.
Nice.

1057
01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:32.930
Maybe a little smile.
Keep it moving.
All right.

1058
01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.760
Now that I took less than five seconds to even describe all that.
Well,

1059
01:03:35.761 --> 01:03:39.720
so I think five.
You want to have five seconds.
I'll show you five seconds.

1060
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:44.550
He's looking in one,
two,
three,
four,

1061
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.150
five.
So someone can look at you that long.
Yeah,
that's good.
That's all right.

1062
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:51.930
Yeah,
that's fine.
That's fine.
You're a hard shit.
All right.
Five seconds.

1063
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:55.650
Any ladies out there if you want to,
you want to add some time to that?

1064
01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.400
You want to shave some off there?
That is the kind of thing that the guys though,

1065
01:03:59.460 --> 01:03:59.971
cause listen,

1066
01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:04.230
sometimes you know what's the worst thing is when you're not a fucking pervert,

1067
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:07.830
but the woman's gorgeous and she's wearing something so revealing and then she

1068
01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:10.770
comes at you like you're a fucking creep and you just like,

1069
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.240
you're wearing a cat soup.

1070
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:13.580
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1071
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.460
<v 5>Like what am I supposed,
I'm not supposed to fucking look.</v>

1072
01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.613
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1073
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.600
<v 5>That's all right.
That sounds,
yeah,
you can.
I,</v>

1074
01:04:22.601 --> 01:04:27.560
it's like I keep saying look and keep it moving,
but that's it.

1075
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:31.570
I know what I have to be this whole fucking thing where you're like staring and

1076
01:04:31.571 --> 01:04:35.380
panting and by staring you're trying to get my attention so that I react.

1077
01:04:35.381 --> 01:04:39.310
It's like if you're going to stare then I catch you staring.
Just sorry.

1078
01:04:39.311 --> 01:04:42.880
It's for stair and you just,
you,
you look beautiful.
Thank you.
Moving on.

1079
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:46.700
There you go.
And then what if he tries to talk to you?
I mean he,
you know,

1080
01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.250
what's he supposed to do?
You'll look good.
He wants to fucking,
uh,
you know,

1081
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:56.260
thank you.
Keep it moving.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

1082
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:59.530
you can't,
well what if he wants to a sheet?
It what if,
what if?

1083
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.390
What if you were single?
I mean you have one.
Well,

1084
01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:08.110
it depends.
If I'm interested in like continuing the conversation or whatever,

1085
01:05:08.111 --> 01:05:10.150
then yes,
let's continue the conversation.

1086
01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.150
But in all aspects you got to like wait for like the opening to appear.

1087
01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:18.400
You can't just force the opening.
That sounds gross.
Yeah.

1088
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:25.500
Don't know.
We're like door to door salesman,
single guys.
We just,

1089
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:29.830
we have to like fucking just knock on the door.
Yeah.
Are you doing I'll pill.

1090
01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.860
I really like to have some effects.
Okay,
thank you.
How are you doing?

1091
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:37.770
Yeah,
and that's the thing about it.
It's like guys,
act like,
you know,

1092
01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.700
it's not like the fucking end of the world.
Like,
you know,

1093
01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:43.190
10 seconds later you're talking,
I'm looking at somebody else.

1094
01:05:43.191 --> 01:05:46.280
So what is the big deal about moving on?

1095
01:05:46.281 --> 01:05:51.200
If there's not like the person's saying in your music fucking break,

1096
01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:54.800
why can't I can't get mad at end of this five second look,
keep it moving.

1097
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:58.340
If I give me a look like I want to keep talking,
these are really basic ideas,

1098
01:05:58.341 --> 01:06:01.250
you know what I mean?
It is.
It's really,
it's really basic.
It's all right,

1099
01:06:01.251 --> 01:06:04.020
but what was the talk to you that they'll continue talking to you.
Oh,

1100
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:07.340
thank you so much.
Old are,
are you here with a friend or not?
Boom.

1101
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.781
Let me ask you this.

1102
01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:12.200
Have you ever been out with a front who's wearing something so revealing and

1103
01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:14.540
they're getting so much of that attention?
They're complaining about it.

1104
01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:15.950
Have you ever said to him like,
well,

1105
01:06:15.951 --> 01:06:18.970
maybe you should've put the girls away a little more.
You know,

1106
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:21.640
maybe you should have brought the garage door down a little bit more.
No,

1107
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:26.330
you've never said that.
No,
I've never said that to any of my girlfriends.

1108
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:28.880
Have you ever thought it even felt it?
No.

1109
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:33.920
You've never had a roommate or a girlfriend just show up and be like,
oh my God,

1110
01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:37.610
her who ha is almost peaking out from underneath that dress.

1111
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.800
This is what I'll tell you.
It's gonna be a rough one.
Like,

1112
01:06:39.801 --> 01:06:40.790
you know all of these dogs.

1113
01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:43.220
You never think that I had to be honest with you though.

1114
01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:48.221
I don't think that most of my girlfriend's dress revealingly okay.

1115
01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:49.964
So have you seen,

1116
01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.970
have you seen somebody that you don't know show up at a club.
Okay.
With like,

1117
01:06:55.971 --> 01:06:59.510
you know,
body paint on and a pair of pastries and just go like,

1118
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:04.940
am I at carnival?
Like what is she going,
you know what I'm talking about?

1119
01:07:04.941 --> 01:07:09.590
I'm just asking do women also look at the woman yes.
And look at her and be like,

1120
01:07:09.591 --> 01:07:14.000
what is that idiot doing?
Um,
yeah,
probably.

1121
01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.100
I think that's a yes,

1122
01:07:16.101 --> 01:07:19.250
but for some reason you're not going to give it to me cause I'm a guy.
Well No,

1123
01:07:19.251 --> 01:07:20.210
I don't think that's it.

1124
01:07:20.211 --> 01:07:23.570
I think there's definitely been times where you're just like,
really girl.
Really?

1125
01:07:23.571 --> 01:07:28.240
Okay.
All right.
And that's,
that's,
that's about it from my girl.

1126
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.610
Really.
Okay.
Okay.
That's fine.
Okay.
That's not a good answer.

1127
01:07:31.611 --> 01:07:34.670
Like if I see a girl wearing shorts that are like,

1128
01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.730
like denim shorts that are basically fitting you like underwear.

1129
01:07:37.731 --> 01:07:42.260
I feel like that's a little extra to have your ass hanging out.

1130
01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:44.660
But if a girl wants that walk around with her ass hanging out,
I,

1131
01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:47.540
it's like I'm not,
it doesn't trip me out.

1132
01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:51.580
But I do personally feel like it's a little bit much.
And why is that?

1133
01:07:51.581 --> 01:07:55.240
And I'm also getting older so I'm getting a little bit more conservative cause I

1134
01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:59.720
don't need to see your ass cheeks or I don't need to see that.
Yeah,
there's not,

1135
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:04.130
a lot of times I will contribute,
it's not bore me.

1136
01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.590
It's not even necessarily for guys.
It's for her.

1137
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:10.760
So despite how I might do this,
by the way,

1138
01:08:10.761 --> 01:08:13.220
I might feel about how she's dressed.

1139
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:17.300
That is her decision be dressed,
how she's dressed and guess what?

1140
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.660
It doesn't ruin my whole day and it doesn't send me into this tailspin of like,

1141
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.840
oh my God,
I don't understand.
He's girls are walking around half naked and no,

1142
01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:28.400
I'm not supposed to look like Wham,
wham,
five seconds.

1143
01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.810
<v 1>Keep it moving.
No boy,
here's my thing.</v>

1144
01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:35.820
Do you understand how fucking ridiculous it is to walk down the street with your

1145
01:08:35.821 --> 01:08:38.220
ass hanging out?
I do understand how ridiculous.

1146
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.240
I do think it's ridiculous and I think it's too much,
but again,

1147
01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:47.000
it's not my fucking thing to get upset about what somebody else is doing.

1148
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.360
You know?
It's funny,

1149
01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.620
it's not my business when I drive down the street being it asthma and if a woman

1150
01:08:52.621 --> 01:08:56.340
has her ass hanging out,
I'm just like,
I got like a free show.
Yes,
exactly.

1151
01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:57.780
There's that classic thing.

1152
01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:02.660
There's that classic thing where like cow guys can't do that.

1153
01:09:02.661 --> 01:09:05.700
There's nothing we could do like physically like that that makes you guys almost

1154
01:09:05.701 --> 01:09:07.710
crash.
Your car is a hacky joke,

1155
01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:10.590
but if you're walking down the street with a half our nutbag hanging out,

1156
01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:11.424
you'd be like,

1157
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.313
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1158
01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:18.200
cause that's not random.
I know we're animal sex.

1159
01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:20.570
Say a woman's ass can be sexy.
Her breasts,

1160
01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:24.400
her legs or whole body is just like curvy and delicious and the whole bit,

1161
01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:29.180
it's like a bag hanging out,
discuss thing and you want to call the police.

1162
01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:35.030
If it was a car,
like the woman's like a Lamborghini or a Ferrari or a Porsche.

1163
01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:36.690
When we're looking at pictures,

1164
01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:40.610
do you know like have you ever heard of a woman like going into a place and

1165
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:44.120
exposing her genitals to like a room full of men running out?

1166
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:45.610
<v 1>As creepy as that is,</v>

1167
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:51.730
I flashers are the funniest fucking thing ever.
To me.
The fact that the,

1168
01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.420
you know the classic one with the fucking wingtip shoes,

1169
01:09:55.450 --> 01:10:00.450
the dark socks and just the raincoat on and you just throw open your fucking

1170
01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:06.020
coat is showing your flacid Dick or whatever to me and then people are

1171
01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:11.870
horrified.
Like the reaction that you get dramatic.
It's fucking,

1172
01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:14.680
that's the funny thing about it is that the,

1173
01:10:14.681 --> 01:10:17.920
you would think that you did doing something cause in the end you wanted to get

1174
01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:22.270
a positive reaction but to fucking throw it open and people were literally

1175
01:10:22.271 --> 01:10:26.260
repulse.
Like when you do that,
looking at your naked body,

1176
01:10:26.261 --> 01:10:29.800
the fact that they get off on that is fucking hilarious to me.

1177
01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.330
It's so gross.
It's just a dick.

1178
01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:40.320
It's just that there's a dick outside,
you know,
wants to be free now.

1179
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:44.320
Now it doesn't,
it doesn't want to be pray.
It doesn't need to be free.

1180
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:48.510
Keep it tucks away and your little underpants,
you know,

1181
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.760
I can understand most fetishes that was at the,
for the life of me,

1182
01:10:51.761 --> 01:10:53.860
I don't get what,
what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1183
01:10:53.861 --> 01:10:57.600
And then you do that and then what you jerk off to the screams still ringing.

1184
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.460
<v 5>I Dunno.
It's just,
I don't even know if they do it when I was on,</v>

1185
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:07.880
I don't think that they do it.
Like,
I think Hollywood

1186
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.590
<v 1>made it be the raincoat because they couldn't show a dick on film for whatever</v>

1187
01:11:11.591 --> 01:11:13.590
reason.
So they just had the guy go like that.

1188
01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:16.270
So it would block all of it and you just see his naked legs and you would eat.

1189
01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.830
It was understood that he was naked.
But I think really it's,
for the most part,

1190
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.610
it's probably sweatpants and they'd probably yank 'em down and then they have it

1191
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:24.444
right underneath there.

1192
01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:29.190
<v 5>Can they go?
All right.
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

1193
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.020
I remember being in a New York City subway car and this guy started masturbating

1194
01:11:36.021 --> 01:11:39.320
in front of me and I ran out and I was pretty much in tears.

1195
01:11:39.321 --> 01:11:44.030
It was so upsetting and it was just so,
it's like it's violating,
you know,

1196
01:11:44.031 --> 01:11:46.940
to someone staring at you and just being like,
why are you laughing?

1197
01:11:46.941 --> 01:11:50.420
It's not funny.
It was really upsetting.

1198
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:51.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1199
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:54.310
<v 5>See you don't fucking get it.
I know.</v>

1200
01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.750
I figure you should have laughed at him and pointed right at is well,
yeah,

1201
01:11:57.751 --> 01:11:59.290
you gotta go exactly what he wanted.

1202
01:11:59.291 --> 01:12:02.320
He wanted to like me to keep like watching it and like,
no,

1203
01:12:02.321 --> 01:12:06.410
he wanted you to be fucking shocked.
I would,
I don't know either way either.

1204
01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:11.200
Either way was just horrifying.
And it felt like,
it felt terrible.
It was like,

1205
01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:16.000
it was,
it was,
uh,
a real violation of me,
you know,

1206
01:12:16.001 --> 01:12:20.570
like you can't just like see a stranger and just started jerking off.
What the,

1207
01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:25.150
take a mental picture,
keep it moving,
get home,
and then rub one out.
Right.

1208
01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.790
Gentlemen for your dirty studio.
Roach infested apartment.

1209
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.340
<v 1>Well,
why just cause he jerks off from the train.</v>

1210
01:12:31.341 --> 01:12:33.260
Doesn't mean it can't be successful.
Nine to five.

1211
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.580
<v 5>I don't really care about his,
his success.</v>

1212
01:12:35.581 --> 01:12:38.820
If he feels the need to jerk off and maybe he's one of those guys,
he's like,

1213
01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.780
we're not a success

1214
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:45.050
<v 1>failure.
I got to think afterwards,
after you had done doing it,</v>

1215
01:12:45.051 --> 01:12:47.510
that gets some point when he'd come home and you're brushing your teeth and you

1216
01:12:47.511 --> 01:12:50.420
look yourself in the mirror,
you gotta be like,
Wow,
I'm that guy.
I'm that guy.

1217
01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:52.190
The jerks off to people on the trade.

1218
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:54.430
I'm sure they hate themselves and they should

1219
01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.580
look at Clio half on the bed,
half off.
And I'm sitting over here like,

1220
01:13:01.581 --> 01:13:04.670
what do you want?
What do you want from me?
All right.
Halloween drama.
Okay.
Yeah.

1221
01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:06.710
So getting back to that thing,
he didn't do something wrong.

1222
01:13:06.711 --> 01:13:07.850
They have the guy's a fucking creep.

1223
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.261
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1224
01:13:08.261 --> 01:13:12.040
you should definitely like interject when shit like that is going on and let

1225
01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:13.330
other men know.
That's not cool.

1226
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:17.720
<v 1>Alright.
Hologram comedians a breaking bad bill.</v>

1227
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:20.000
Have you heard the comedy club in New York?

1228
01:13:20.001 --> 01:13:23.120
Might Showcase Carlin and prior holograms.

1229
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:29.090
Uh,
okay.
I mean I don't,
I don't get that.
That's fucking weird.

1230
01:13:29.091 --> 01:13:31.670
That's like a live week to me.
Why?

1231
01:13:31.671 --> 01:13:34.490
I don't understand the point of it's so stupid.

1232
01:13:34.491 --> 01:13:37.610
Just go home and go home and what it's going to be material you've already seen.

1233
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.510
So all you gotta do is you just go home and you just put in the DVD.

1234
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:46.280
I would like to have been there for that Tupac Hologram at Coachella a couple of

1235
01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.210
years ago.
That would have been interesting.
Only because you know,

1236
01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.320
<v 5>you're probably like on a ton of drugs at Coachella and stuff like that.</v>

1237
01:13:53.321 --> 01:13:57.570
So you're just like,
like there are all these videos of people like recording it,

1238
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.820
you know on their phone and you hear people in the background going,

1239
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.490
I knew it and people would be like,
I told you,

1240
01:14:02.491 --> 01:14:05.000
I told him like he was actually alive.
And then they're like,
oh no,
no,

1241
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:06.970
<v 1>it isn't all,
you know what I don't like about it.</v>

1242
01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:10.750
What I don't like about it is to pop.
Didn't agree to do the,

1243
01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.210
he didn't agree on the money.
Who owns the rights to his likeness?
Mom Probably.

1244
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:19.990
And she probably gave it the,
okay,
can I tell you?
So really,

1245
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:22.600
what does that the afterschool special version of entertainment,

1246
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:26.380
I'll tell you right now,
I bet I'm going right now in,
in,
in the future.

1247
01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:31.150
In the future,
I bet all dead celebrities like,

1248
01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:36.040
like fucking scumbag people in this business will own their likeness.

1249
01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:41.041
They'll somehow trick the fucking next to f whoever into fucking selling the

1250
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:42.761
rights to them.

1251
01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:45.820
And they'll still have these people touring and they'll put together like these,

1252
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:50.770
these hologram fantasy teams and Pete and they'll make money off of these people

1253
01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:52.840
and their loved ones won't get any of the cash.

1254
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:56.500
That's what I'm guessing that's going to be the lawsuit and the next 20 years

1255
01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:02.010
that a dead fucking George Carlin went on tour and grows $20 million of

1256
01:15:03.141 --> 01:15:07.660
something like that and none of his next to Ken got any money and then some

1257
01:15:07.661 --> 01:15:11.770
fucking little piece of shit.
We'll have no comment.
Yeah.

1258
01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:16.610
You don't think so.
That's what I think about that.
That doesn't happen clean.

1259
01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.330
Of course it will.
There are they already fucking,
they'd been used.

1260
01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.340
They started using them in and commercials.

1261
01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:25.240
They had like a dead John Wayne selling like fucking an Xbox or something.

1262
01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:29.180
It's fucking ridiculous.
All right.
Cross country onto them.
Here we go.

1263
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:33.340
Cross country.
Oh,
I already did that one.
Oh,
this lady said really quickly,
uh,

1264
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.250
she was saying she's 25 year old girl and she's uh,

1265
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.110
going to be moving across the country.
She's driving La to a Los Angeles.

1266
01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.910
She's driving the car by herself.

1267
01:15:42.911 --> 01:15:46.240
Obviously get the whole fucking thing to be careful.
Yeah,
right.

1268
01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:49.330
That's what I was saying.
I said she should do it with somebody else.

1269
01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.280
I'm going to tell me I should be.
It shouldn't be able to handle it.
She'll be,

1270
01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:55.780
she'll be all right.
Just be careful.
Yeah.

1271
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:59.890
Does it make sure that car is running perfectly and you know,

1272
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:03.970
make sure you don't stop at any sketchy fucking motels and always makes me think

1273
01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:08.920
of your man about,
um,
murderers.
Buffet.
What did you call it?

1274
01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:13.560
Serial killer.
Busted her killer buffet.

They just locked down.
Well,

1275
01:16:13.561 --> 01:16:16.690

Kill a buffet.

1276
01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:19.900
I'm killing this guy and killing that guy.
That one's all right.
Yeah.

1277
01:16:19.901 --> 01:16:23.580
You stayed in the fucking hotel from a no country for old men.
All right.

1278
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:26.290
Legal Zoom.
Everybody got to do a couple of,

I was so happy and within 24 fucking hours,

1286
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:58.840
That's what you're saying.

I'm going to have dogs.

1289
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:07.510
I'm up dogs and I'm going to go down to a massage parlor ever day.

1290
01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:10.250
Get one rubbed out and I'm going to be good for the rest of the day.

Tell my jokes.
That's it.</v>

1292

1293
01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.070

1294
01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:27.290
you'd dump?
Baller,
oatmeals and all meals at sugar corn smacks.

1295
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:32.120
Now it's steel cutting for Nola that hasn't dried banana and if for some fucking

1296
01:17:32.121 --> 01:17:36.410
reason.
All right,
legal zoom.
You don't like bananas?
I don't like the texture.

1297
01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.610
I hate when you say that.
It's always a food that I like and then you'd go,

1298
01:17:40.611 --> 01:17:42.650
why don't you like it?
Did the,
I don't like the texture.

1299
01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:47.480
That's a narcissist that I can't even not like a certain food and get offended

1300
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:50.810
by it.
Like what do you care?
No,
no words.

1301
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:54.620
I know like I don't like always me.
Why Bill?
I like texture.

1302
01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:58.490
I'm says that it's a legitimate thing.
I don't like the texture of banana.

1303
01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:03.350
It feels weird in my mouth.
It's not so fun to fucking piece of food.
Okay.

1304
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:07.340
Texture can refer to things that aren't just like furniture,
furniture.

1305
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:14.960
I just hated it.
They don't like the texture like you some food critic.

1306
01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.940
Just be happy.
God made it and eat it.

1307
01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:21.810
Good legal zone to say that.
Say that Sunday,

1308

Yeah.

Thankfully.
By the way,
can you work in the banana thing?

1310

I didn't like the texture.

I like how you shout into a microphone,

1359
01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:36.610
which is designed to project your voice.
So I know,
I know.
I actually,
I pulled my,

1360
01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:39.550
my head away.
I'm a master at using the microphone.

1361
01:21:39.551 --> 01:21:43.510
If you actually took the time to watch one of my sets one time.
Oh please.

1362
01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:47.890
And you watch TV,
you watch the ebb and flow of the,
I bring that crowd up.

1363
01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:52.200
I pushed him away.
Yeah,
it's a real journey.

1364
01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:55.270
It is that you take my Dick Jokes,
have three acts to them.

1365
01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:57.990
You know what,
Nia,

1366
01:21:57.990 --> 01:22:02.230
I was so excited to see you and I still am and for you to sit here coming back

1367
01:22:02.231 --> 01:22:06.220
and yet I'm not.
I'm not feeling the love from you.
You still look cute.

1368
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:10.510
That notion.
No thank you.
No,
I'm excited to have you back.

1369
01:22:10.511 --> 01:22:12.970

That's great.
That's your home.

1370
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.730
You sound like you're reading a statement from look for an incorporation.

1371

We are excited to have him back.
I was gone for two weeks,

1373
01:22:25.151 --> 01:22:26.740
at this time.
Right,
exactly.

1374
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:30.250
You'll get that goddamn dog that thinks slept eight hours last night.

1375
01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.300
I literally walked around the block,
even food and it is just out like a light.

1376
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:38.980
It's like now people,
it's,
it's on his dog bed.
Three quarter of his dog.

1377
01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.140
His body is on the dog bed and then like it's head and neck is off.
Okay.

1378
01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:47.850
Looks like it passed out.
He's like,
it's fading.
All right.

1379
01:22:47.851 --> 01:22:52.200
That's the podcast for this week.
Thank you everybody for listening and uh,

1381
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:59.820
I love cheese steak.
I don't like,
I felt like you were leering at it.

1382
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.950
Just look at the sandwich and keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

1383
01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:04.320
I love cheese steaks.

1384
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:07.510
It's my favorite in the whole world is a Philly cheese steak.

1385
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:11.260
Do you have to say Philly cheese steak or can you just say cheese steak when

1386
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:14.360
you're in Philly cheesesteak.
But everywhere else they've built,

1387
01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:18.700
when you're in fucking France,
you just ordered onion soup,

1388
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:23.170
you know,
go.
Okay,
can I get French onion soup?
They're like,
well,
you're in France,

1389
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.020
you fucking idiot.
So everything here is going to be French onion soup.

1390
01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:30.930
I guess that's true.
Okay.
Um,

1391
01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.010
everyone's telling me to go to John's roast pork in it.

1392
01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:38.610
Doesn't that just sound good?
The name?
Oh,
it's a,
it's a place to eat.
Yeah,

1393
01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.690
because one of the two.
What are the two touristy places?

1394
01:23:40.691 --> 01:23:44.790
It's Geno's and what else?
Oh,
I forget.

1395
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:49.750
Gino and a Rabinowitz's.
Yup.
Chinos.

1396
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:56.650
Oh wait,
Phil too.
They're right next to each other,
right?
Yeah.
Hang on.

1397
01:23:56.651 --> 01:23:57.484
Hang on

1398
01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:02.920
Geno's steaks and uh,

1399
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:04.600
and then the other one,

1400
01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.450
I don't know how to look it up and I can't do it with one fucking aunt evil.

1401
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:10.840
But even those were good last time in version went though.
We,
we got,

1402
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:13.720
we both got stood in line.
He stood in one.
I stood in the other,

1403
01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:18.310
we got one of each,
cut them in half and then,
oh did like a,
I'd say stats.
Yeah.

1404
01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.380
Alright.
Top 10 spots.
They are you,

1405
01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:23.080
are you willing to reveal which one you liked better?

1406
01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.030
Um,
all pats.
All right,

1407
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:31.260
so one of them had a better cheese.
I can never remember this ship.

1408
01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:36.070
Do you get or I liked the bread.
Better Whiz.
I don't like Wiz.
I like real cheese.

1409
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:39.570
Me Too.
I like the real cheese.
The cop fucking good.
Those look,

1410
01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.620
and this is thanks to you guys.
Go on.
Understand stand out here.

1411
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:43.690
They just don't have good delis.
They can't make good,

1412
01:24:43.691 --> 01:24:47.380
it's the dry air or something that can make good bread.
The sandwiches,

1413
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.730
the pizza is fucked up.
Got Up as Shami place.

1414
01:24:52.570 --> 01:24:55.930
That's supposed to be really good.
And downtown La.
I forget the name of it.

1415
01:24:55.931 --> 01:24:59.170
They talked about it on that show.
The comedians.
Oh,

1416
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:02.770

Show that I absolutely loved it.

1417
01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:05.920
