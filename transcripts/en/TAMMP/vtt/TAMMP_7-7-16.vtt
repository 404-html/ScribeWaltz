1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.430
Hey going on.
It's bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:06.740
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:11.480
And I am just checking in on you.
My voice is still fucked up.

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.010
I got two more records people episode nine and number 10,
we're just broke.

5
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:17.420
Number 10,
we're almost done,

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.010
which means all freckles is going to do be doing a bunch of spots around loss of

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.620
Congolese getting ready for my European tour.
Tor,
Tor.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.910
Tor.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Which starts off in Dublin,
Ireland,

9
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.570
Dublin,
Ireland and a,
you know what's funny is I tried to uh,
on,

10
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.940
on July 31st it starts off and I tried to get a,
you know,

11
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.260
get a direct flight to the Emerald Aisle and the uh,

12
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.530
at this point because waited so long to get the fucking tickets,
um,

13
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.150
you know,
which is a whole other story in itself,
you know what I mean?

14
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.390
Cause I'm going to take a vacation with my wife afterwards and she was trying to

15
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:58.470
figure out where the fuck we were going to go.
And I was like,
lady,
Yep.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.740
You better fucking figure out a place soon cause this is going to cost me a

17
00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:07.540
fortune there.
Um,
so,
uh,

18
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.190
it turns out the out of lax,
the only two airlines,

19
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:16.300
it was air Lingus and um,
uh,

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.740
what the fuck is it?
Oh Jesus,
I already forgot the name of the,

21
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.810
what the hell is an Ethiopian airlines

22
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.800
figured that one out.

23
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.030
I don't want to fly Ethiopian Airlines unless I'm going to like,
you know,

24
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.320
Ethiopia,
Aer Lingus,
the Irish one.
You know,

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.320
is that weird?
Like if I'm going to go to the Middle East,
I want to fly,

26
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.210
uh,
that whatever United Arab Emirates.

27
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.640
I don't,

28
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.690
it's just weird superstition that I have like the people at Ethiopian Airlines

29
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:56.620
don't care because they're flying to Ireland.
Does that make any sense?

30
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.240
It doesn't,
that's just how scary flying us.
Like if I'm going to Poland,

31
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.650
I want a couple of Polish guy flying it despite all the jokes about them.

32
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.850
Hey,
how many Polish guys is it take to fly a plane?
A fucking,

33
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:14.080
hopefully two of them,
you know,
that studied

34
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.410
all this shit they needed to know.
So aer Lingus was more expensive,
and I said,

35
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.520
well fuck it.
I'm going to take the,

36
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.920
I don't even know if that's the Irish one for some reason.

37
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:27.700
I think that's the one with the four leaf clover.
Oh,
is it?

38
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.290
They've got a Leprechaun on the fucking tail fin.
Let me look this up.

39
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.360
Aer Lingus Lattie every Irish guy's giving me shit about my bad accident.

40
00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:42.130
Like I give a fuck.
All right.
Aer Lingus images.
Yeah,

41
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:44.830
there it is.
Oh,
it's a three leaf clover.

42
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:48.550
I've put another fucking leaf on there yet.
Cuts.
Make me feel a little better.

43
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.670
Oh,
Jesus.
Is that the best plane they got?
Oh boy.

44
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.510
That looks like just some shit from the early seventies.
All right,

45
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.010
let's look at Ethiopia.

46
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.760
Where Ethiopian Airlines,

47
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.170
there's no food on this plane.
Sorry.

48
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.510
Ethiopian Airlines.

49
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.200
Let's see what we got here.
What do we got here?

50
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.060
<v 0>I'm not gonna lie to you.
Both of these planes still look these,</v>

52
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.030
neither one of these,
uh,
very,
uh,
uh,
look at the stewardesses.

53
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.700
They look pretty fucked.
They didn't have any stewards for the Irish ones.

54
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.180
They probably all hammered.
Could I have any more stereotypes in this?

55
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.383
<v 1>MMM.</v>

56
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.940
<v 0>All right.
They both have professional whose kid?
No,</v>

57
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.970
you don't what it is once you travel outside of your own country.

58
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.000
You know what I mean?
I fly American Airlines,
I fly United,

59
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.640
I fly shit that I've heard of.
I've always done that.

60
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:45.850
Except early on in my career when I used to fly like fucking,

61
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.340
what the fuck was that one?
It was air something or other.
I felt fluid.

62
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.900
Ata.
I mean,
you flew on that fucking airlines.
They,

63
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.890
it was like,
like the cabin to the stuffed of cockpit was open.

64
00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:03.590
They were up there playing like connect four and shit.
It was,
it was really bad.

65
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.240
I have to,
I'll tell you it was bad,
you know?
Um,
no,
it was,
it was just like,

66
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.100
it was still weird to sing.

67
00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:15.101
You'd been in an in an airport and just feeling like you were in America and

68
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:18.860
then you'd get on a ta and you will literally felt like you were leaving a war

69
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:21.860
torn country.
Like you just look around like,

70
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.810
what a fuck all these extras come from.

71
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:28.730
Am I am I gonna my in some fucking a George Clooney movie that's some important

72
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:33.320
George,
one of those selling arms for some shit,
you know,

73
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.530
a very important story that needed to be tell w told we are filmmakers and this

74
00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:43.450
is what we do.
You know George,

75
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:47.080
they said this script was floating around Hollywood for a while.
Well you know,

76
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:51.730
I'm good.
Look at it and I said I'm going to do it.
So it got made.
Um Oh,

77
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:56.290
I got a call out fucking Michael Rappaport.
Okay,
okay.

78
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:59.260
And you know you would think that I'm going to call him out for the fact that

79
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:02.320
his resting face,
you never heard of resting bitch face.

80
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.340
You don't want his face looks like it looks like you remember that face Danny

81
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.380
Ainge would make after he got called for a foul.

82
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.380
That's what his resting face looks like.
All right.

83
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.520
Now I love this man except what he talks sports.

84
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.940
I've never seen somebody hate on Boston sports the way he does.
Right?

85
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.540
So he wrote some more bullshit about Boston sports.

86
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:25.210
So I call him up breaking his balls going through,
you know,

87
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:29.200
what you wrote is in true laughing.
We have a great fucking time.

88
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.740
He goes on the Internet like some real housewife whore who were right and you

89
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:39.930
know what he said?
He said,
wow,
bill Burgess called me up like,
uh,

90
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.970
threatening big Blahblahblah and all this fucking a,

91
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.810
he's a,
he's tweeting like some Instagram whore that's just trying to get fucking

92
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.550
followers.
I don't understand Michael.
Somebody send you into this clip right now.

93
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.150
I even told them how fucking bitchy he was being above Boston sports.

94
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.010
My Q,
I guess he was freaking out that uh,

95
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.000
that the Celtics might get Kevin Durant,
which um,

96
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.300
you know,
who's getting it with the whole free agency game.

97
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:13.430
This is how it works as a fan,

98
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.900
everybody doesn't like it unless the free agent comes to their team.

99
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.390
That's basically it.
But at the end of the day,

100
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.990
even when they do come to the a team in the back of your head,
you know,

101
00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:25.830
it's bullshit,

102
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.523
<v 2>right?</v>

103
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.570
<v 0>I mean,
what happened?
Yo,
you're,
you're getting fucked over by your team.</v>

104
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:33.220
You want to go make some more money,
fine.

105
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.360
But I'm talking to when you were an elite fucking player and you go to pile on

106
00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:41.080
another fucking team.
And I'm talking as a Celtics fan when we did that.

107
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:42.130
And what was it?
Oh wait.

108
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.980
<v 0>The only thing that made a decent was that the Lakers had a bunch of free
agents.</v>

110
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.560
So we met in the finals and it was sort of,

111
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.700
it was like the 80s in that those two teams were in the finals back to back

112
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:58.250
years.
But I mean it was,
it was bullshit.

113
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.690
Like I don't look at the Oh eight Celtics,
like it was a blur.

114
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.400
We went from last place to first place,

115
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:07.610
we won the fucking thing and then we played them again next year in the finals

116
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.740
and the referee is called 9,000 files on us and like 15 on the fucking Lakers.

117
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:16.320
And for some reason that was considered a good game.
Seven,
I don't know.
Uh,

118
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.910
but that's the NBA,
you know,
every once in a while they have a mobbed up ref,

119
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.800
you know,
Patrick Ewing goes to the Knicks.
Yeah.

120
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.920
You know,
it's a business.
Um,

121
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.100
but I think,
cause I,

122
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.890
when I look at the NFL where they got the parody there and uh,
all of a sudden,

123
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:40.940
you know,
the Seahawks out of fucking nowhere can win one,
you know,

124
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.460
fucking Patriot stunk for fucking ever.
All of a sudden we got good,
you go up,

125
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:48.800
you go down these guys when those guys,
you know,

126
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:53.480
it's nice and fucking everybody kind of has a chance now and that's been great.

127
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:56.600
Their ratings are better than ever as far as I know.
And I think the,

128
00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:01.601
the route that the NBA is going is they create these super teams and people hate

129
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.840
them so much that they watch rooting for them to loose.

130
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.970
And um,
I dunno,
I liked it better.
I mean back in the day,
like I said,

131
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:15.380
there was free agency in that type of shit,
but it wasn't just the way it is now.

132
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:19.860
The amount of times where people pull the old Johnny Damon where you've,

133
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.060
well I guess Damon one with the red sox and then like the next year or whatever,

134
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:26.930
he goes to the fucking Yankees.
It's just like what Jesus Christ.
Can you,

135
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.140
can you ease your way around the fact that it's just a business and it's all

136
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:34.850
about money,
you know?
Um,
I dunno,

137
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.410
I actually don't know how Kevin Durant really helps the warriors in a way.

138
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:40.611
You know,

139
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:45.611
they had their two guys that were the guys and then he's coming in and in a lot

140
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:48.980
of ways he's at least number two,

141
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.530
depending on what you think about the fucking,

142
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.340
the fucking honor roll student there.
Um,

143
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.990
I dunno,
I know people say they just want to win,

144
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.990
but I think egos get hurt when you know,
you,

145
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:08.820
you used to get 25 points a game and now you're down to like 21 or 19.

146
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.830
I Dunno,
we'll see what the fuck happens.
But,
uh,
uh,
sucked.

147
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.100
I was really hoping he was going to stay in Oklahoma.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

148
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.980
I was hoping that,
uh,
you know,

149
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.500
after last year where they were up three games to one,

150
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.260
that they were going in the off season and be like,

151
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:28.470
you know what the fuck happened?
We don't know how.
We don't know how to win.

152
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.930
We don't know how to close somebody out.

153
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.550
And what I loved about watching the warriors come back against Oklahoma as much

154
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:39.780
as I was Rooney for Oklahoma,
and she got to watch a championship team

155
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.350
like w w what the warriors did,

156
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.740
being down three games to one coming back in that series was,

157
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.530
it was fucking hilarious to me.
Like watching them,
it was like,

158
00:09:50.531 --> 00:09:51.570
you remember the horror movie?

159
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:55.200
Like they never changed their pace when they went down,
they didn't panic.

160
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.600
They just kept coming.
You know,

161
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.610
it was like those old school monster movies from the 80s where the fucking Jason

162
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.050
Guy,
right is just walking and the victim is running away.

163
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.290
He's the victim's running,
the monsters walking,

164
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:12.650
but the person running keeps looking over their shoulder.

165
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:15.090
So they keep tripping over logs and shit.
Right?

166
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:18.600
So eventually the fucking dude with the hatchet walks him down and puts him out

167
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:19.920
of their misery.
That's what,

168
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.240
that's what fucking the warriors did to Oklahoma.

169
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.710
Oh Geez.
I'm searching it.
Was that too sophisticated for you?
You know,

170
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:29.730
I got to tell you,

171
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.270
watching the warriors coming back against Oklahoma was like watching Friday the

172
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:40.560
13th part three,
the Oh Geez.
Um,

173
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.700
so I've seen a bunch of teams do that be better than the other team.

174
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:49.920
They just didn't know how to fucking win.
And then what happens is,

175
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.220
as a sports fan,
you get to watch them learn how to win.

176
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.840
You get to watch him.
Sure as hell.
Fuck a tape.
That's what you get to watch.

177
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.540
Unless the best guy goes,
you know what?

178
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:05.541
I don't feel like learning that's going to go join the team that came back and

179
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:10.230
kicked our ass.
I mean,
can you imagine if movies were like that?

180
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

181
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.580
<v 0>All right.
This is like the nerd getting beat up by the bully.
You know,</v>

182
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.730
there's like five nerds getting beat up by these five bullies,
right?

183
00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:21.010
It's five on five.
Right.

184
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.080
And then the third act is not the fucking nerds figure out how to beat down the

185
00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:26.914
bullies.

186
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.120
One of the nerds joins the other bullies and then helps them go back and beat up

187
00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:32.080
all his friends.

188
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:33.920
<v 3>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.670
<v 0>I mean,
granted,
I guess I'd kind of be funny if you're a sick fuck like me,</v>

190
00:11:37.671 --> 00:11:40.640
but at the end of the day that that kind of movie is that,

191
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.341
well,

192
00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:46.520
maybe act two was that he goes to fucking golden state and then act three is he

193
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:49.490
comes back and he has one of those Lebron James type movies.

194
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.980
I don't fucking know.
All I know is that a,
you know,

195
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.960
I kind of got back into the NBA this year.

196
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:59.020
I started watching the Celtics and that type of shit and that was a great

197
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:01.360
rivalry out west and now it's no more.

198
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.110
<v 3>Okay.</v>

199
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:07.880
<v 0>Did you hear what she barked back?
Oh,
it's a great Boston named dude.</v>

200
00:12:07.881 --> 00:12:12.881
Fucking Chow's Buckley said fucking Kevin Durant's it cheetah

201
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.530
not shaking like Tom Brady.
That was bullshit.
Cheek like Kevin Durant.

202
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.800
He's not on our team,
so I'll hold them to the fizz feet to the fire.

203
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.360
<v 1>Um,
uh,</v>

204
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.170
<v 0>not cheating like Jim or say
he said that.
Yeah,</v>

205
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.870
he's trying to cheat his way to a championship.
He used the wrong word,

206
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:41.800
but I understand what he's saying.
He's just,
he's just a fucking,
yeah,
he just,

207
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:42.970
he left the nerd table.

208
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.180
He CA's go on to the bully table and then he's gonna come back and beat up the

209
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:50.650
nurse.
It'd be like,
well,
look and make,
I'm a tough guy over here.
Um,

210
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.820
isn't it amazing how much taller Kevin Durant's than me and I'm still giving him

211
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:55.121
shit.

212
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:58.930
That's the wonderful thing about podcasting is you can fucking talk shit within

213
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:02.730
the safety of your own living room.
All right,
whatever.

214
00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:04.620
I'm going to get off this fucking topic,
but,
uh,

215
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.680
I did in fact to confirm Michael Rappaport real housewife tweet,

216
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.850
by the way,
is there anyone,

217
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.240
can somebody please Photoshop him into one of those real housewife fucking

218
00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:16.074
thinks.

219
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.420
We had a great conversation laughing our balls off when we came to an agreement

220
00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:24.530
in the end of it and that Danny Ainge looking,

221
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.540
motherfucker goes on the Internet and he tweets 180 letters or less about me.

222
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.110
By the way,
I have to apologize for,
I love Michael Rep before I,
you know,

223
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.150
<v 3>okay.</v>

224
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.961
<v 0>Every time I see him,</v>

225
00:13:38.961 --> 00:13:41.620
I always feel like this is the last time I'm ever going to see him.
You know?

226
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.300
There's just something about him.
Even though he's younger than me,

227
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.860
he just moves around like he's in his eighties I think he has that disease.

228
00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:51.890
You know that disease Brad Pitt had in that movie where he was like a fucking

229
00:13:51.891 --> 00:13:56.210
old baby.
Whenever the fuck happened.
I don't know if that's what he wrote.

230
00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:00.590
He reminded no,
I was just a fable.
Right.
What was it called?

231
00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:03.320
A fairy tale.
Whatever.
He fucking,
he's like that,
you know?

232
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.440
You know like when a fucking eight year old looks like this 70 whatever that

233
00:14:06.441 --> 00:14:07.940
disease is called.
[inaudible]

234
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.133
<v 1>MMM.</v>

235
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.520
<v 0>I was going to see George Michael.
That's not,</v>

236
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:16.990
that wasn't the guy who was the guy who played on Ohio state going to Portland.

237
00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:21.520
That port pastored the micro fractures in his feet like he's playing in China

238
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:24.320
now.
I can't remember.

239
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.800
All I'm thinking is haven Moses and I know he played for the Broncos in the 70s

240
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.550
I want to say his name was George wasn't there.
Okay.
We got to look this up now.

241
00:14:34.551 --> 00:14:36.680
How State Ohio,

242
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.520
how state,
uh,
Portland

243
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.780
micro fracture.
Mike not microbrewery.
Get the fuck audio microphones.

244
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.820
Microbreweries are the worst sort of thing.
All right.
What's his name?

245
00:14:55.821 --> 00:14:57.950
What's his name?
Greg [inaudible].

246
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.310
Michael Rappaport has Greg Oden Disease

247
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.300
Eight.
Does it like Greg Oden?

248
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:12.620
He got paid a ton of fucking money and he didn't follow through if we get paid

249
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.580
the,
the,
the,
uh,
national,
uh,

250
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.860
podcasting association drafted him,

251
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:23.150
number one to come on to end the podcasting world to talk about sports,

252
00:15:23.151 --> 00:15:27.740
thinking that he was going to be unfair now thinking that he was going to be

253
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:31.730
biased and fair.
I can't even fucking talk this morning.
Oh my God,

254
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.540
I can't wait to do his podcast again.
You know?

255
00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.800
Who's kidding?
Who were both a couple of real housewives?
You know what I mean?

256
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.980
I think I'm slightly better looking than him though.
Slightly,
you know,

257
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.660
and a little more mobile,
you know,
I think I bring a lot more to a team.

258
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.340
I'm like spike hour,
right?
Utility player him.
I don't know what he is.

259
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:56.000
He's like a fucking Rappaport's,
like a fucking,
you know,

260
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.550
he's like dead d h You know,
his career's over,
you know,

261
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:04.070
he can't touch his toes,
so they can't have him play first base.

262
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:08.300
He just sits on the bench seat and sunflower seeds gets up three,

263
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.790
four times a game.
Squinting into the fucking Sun.

264
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.630
He just sneaks through the fences,
grounds out and do a double play.

265
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:17.390
Kills the rally,
you know.
But he's got such a big contract,

266
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:18.260
they can't get rid of him.

267
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:21.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

268
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.450
<v 0>He's like Greg Luzinski if you went on a diet,
although,
no,</v>

269
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.270
no disrespect to Greg Lissitzky.
All right.

270
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:29.420
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here.
Oh,
Formula One.
Right.

271
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.840
I needed to apologize.
Um,
because when I was say,

272
00:16:34.841 --> 00:16:38.690
when I watched the Austrian Grand Prix that it was like fucking days a thought,

273
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.370
and I said,
Lewis Hamilton was like the Tom Cruise,
the upstart.

274
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.350
I add a completely wrong,

275
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.030
and I want to thank everybody on Twitter that set me straight so eloquently.
Hey,

276
00:16:49.031 --> 00:16:53.750
fuck stick.
Um,
I guess Lewis Hamilton,
he's been,

277
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.690
he's,
he's won it three times.

278
00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.920
He's a 31 fucking years old and he's already won the a for me one championship

279
00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:04.300
three times.
He won it in 2008,

280
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.520
2014 and 2015 Nico Rosberg has never won.

281
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.200
So the reality is is that Nico was the Tom Cruise,
right?

282
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.730
And Lewis Hamilton is the val Kilmer.
He's the ice man.
That's right.

283
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.400
Ice Man.
I am dangerous.

284
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:26.540
And then Lewis Hamilton clicks his teeth together for no fucking reason,
right?

285
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.420
They're all sweaty and shit.
I Dunno.

286
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.960
All I know is the British Grand Prix is a,

287
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.910
is this fucking,
uh,
is this Sunday and that dude toto,

288
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.280
I swear to God,
that's his fucking nickname.

289
00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:46.390
All I want to do when I wake up in the morning is not see the team crash.

290
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.520
Um,
sat down with them.
It was just like,
listen,

291
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:56.250
all right,
right stuff.
Fucking drive in and do each other,

292
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:59.750
mate.
Whatever the fuck he said.
I don't know where he's from.
I think he's just,

293
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.520
I think he is from Austria.
Who knows,

294
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:05.190
I'm new to this sport and I just like throwing up shit as fact.

295
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.900
You know what I mean?
And why would I,

296
00:18:06.901 --> 00:18:11.520
why would I actually waste the time to read up on this sport when I can just

297
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:15.150
make big fucking statements and people on Twitter will correct me anyways,

298
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.230
you know,
then I don't have to look it up.
All I gotta do is just scroll,
you know,

299
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.650
so why these kids are so fucking dumb today.
You know,

300
00:18:23.651 --> 00:18:27.580
they don't read books the way I used to,
you know,
three hours in,

301
00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:31.210
I'm 17 pages in my fucking a DDS off the fucking charts,
right?

302
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.680
Sitting there reading about Tom Sawyer.
You don't think about,
I don't know what,

303
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.050
you know the Queen Mary God knows whatever was said in that fucking book that

304
00:18:41.051 --> 00:18:43.510
made me think of something else.
Apples.

305
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.420
How's this some sort of arsenic in there?

306
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.590
And how many apples would you have to do eat to actually poison yourself?

307
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.760
You know,
eat so many fucking apples.
What do you think?

308
00:18:54.761 --> 00:18:58.510
There's arsenic assumption of,
you know,
the apple,
some sort of poison,

309
00:18:58.511 --> 00:19:01.020
I can't remember what.
But if you eat enough of them right,
you'd actually die.

310
00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:04.600
And that somebody would actually get to say eulogy.
You know,

311
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.770
an apple a day
does in fact keep the doctor away.
But uh,

312
00:19:09.771 --> 00:19:13.760
you know,
eat 42 of them,
you're gonna fucking die.
But you know what?

313
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:17.220
He died the fruit.
Um,

314
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.800
anyways,
let's,
let's read some of the fucking horse shit here for this week.

315
00:19:21.801 --> 00:19:25.460
Let's read some of the advertising.
Shall We?
Is this,

316
00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:29.930
it is just a simple safe.
What does that sound like?
Bad food.

317
00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.090
All right.
No,
it isn't simple.
Safe.
All right.
Helux he licks your unique.

318
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.830
You don't waste.
You don't walk like everyone else.
Talk like everyone else.
Talk.

319
00:19:39.831 --> 00:19:44.690
Walk,
shoot,
shed.
That sounded like the one that Marine Corps.

320
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.350
I'm going to teach you how to walk.
Talk.
[inaudible] cool.

321
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.960
All right.
You're,
you're unique.
Everybody.
You don't walk like everyone else.

322
00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:56.810
Talk like everyone else or sweet like everyone else.

323
00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.260
So why is your mattress you're so,

324
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:03.860
why is your mattresses so why is your mattress

325
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:10.040
Jedi?
You spell mattress.
Well how do you spell mistress?

326
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.360
So why is your mattress one size fits all?
Gee,
I don't know.

327
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:22.050
I don't know cause you fucking cause it fits because it truly customized

328
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:27.250
mattress will cost you a five or 10,000 bucks.
Ah,
that's the reason.

329
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.960
Who the fuck has the money to do that?
They should get audited immediately.

330
00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.950
Do you know I was watching one of those beret Jackson's one time and they had

331
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:39.670
one of those doughs GM that Pereda prod progress.

332
00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.250
Fucking elephant van there.

333
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.930
Somebody spent four point $1 million on that fucking thing.
I was excited.

334
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:48.790
They got a good deal.
You know what I mean?

335
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.980
That guy either needs to get audited or he has his wife bound and gagged and a

336
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:57.580
fucking closet.
How you pull the,
hey,
hey honey,

337
00:20:57.581 --> 00:21:02.500
look what I spent $4 million on a giant fucking toaster that you can drive.

338
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.510
What do you mean?
Why did I do that?
Rp Koa I liked.

339
00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:12.360
I thought it was a good tee off.
Fuck you lady.
Right?

340
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.850
What are these things called?
Gm Parade.

341
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.190
This is still the advertiser Pereda progress.

342
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.950
I used to know what these things were called Pereda progress image,

343
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.930
the GM future line of look,
that fucking thing up.
I mean,
granted,

344
00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:29.070
it's kind of cool,
but it is.

345
00:21:29.071 --> 00:21:34.071
It's like an easy bake oven that you can drive and somebody paid four point $1

346
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.800
million for that fucking thing,
you know?
And all I said,

347
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.190
all I could think was what was he doing in 2008 when they fucking economy

348
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:44.910
crashed other than doing fucking cartwheels out the back door of whatever

349
00:21:44.911 --> 00:21:49.020
fucking bank he worked at.
Oh bill is that social commentary?

350
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.280
You freckled can't just shut up and read the advertising.
All right,
here we go.

351
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.960
Hell looks everybody.
Helix.

352
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.470

They're sleep like anyone else.
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

355
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.320
Because they truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks.

356
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.680
And how many starving children could that feed?

357
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.200
40 50 million for only half a cent today.

358
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.530
Somehow you can give somebody three square meals.

359
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.990
Oh an Ethiopian Airlines.
All right,
for cus your five to 10,000 bucks until now.

360
00:22:27.991 --> 00:22:32.520
So go to x stuck sleep.com.

362
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:41.330
proprietary algorithms they've developed it.

363
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.600
Doesn't that sound like a bunch of bullshit?
Jmu Wham,

364
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:49.290
proprietary analytic algorithms?
I can't say it,
so it must be good.

365
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.520
Uh,

366
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:55.830
biomechanics experts.

367
00:22:55.831 --> 00:22:59.040

their reality show.
Okay.
And what's great about our country's,

425
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.060
everybody truly does get a chance.
I'm like your countries.

426
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.930
I have no fucking idea what's going on over there.
Evidently England,
uh,

427
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:51.870
decided to not be part of the European Union.
Is that what happened?

428
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.110
I love how like as an American,
I'm supposed to know this shit,

429
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.100
a union that I'm not into.
I understand what's going on over there.

430
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.830
The banks are sewing up all your fucking countries.

431
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.180
It's like when you fucking buy a a,
a Co op,
you know,

432
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.230
versus the condo.
You buy a condo.
The person next to you.

433
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:13.440
It can be a fucking junkie who gives a shit.
You still got your condo.

434
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:18.180
But if you're in a co op playoffs,
if you're in a Co op,

435
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.210
this is the deal.
What you're,
you're not buying an apartment.

436
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.120
What you're doing is you're buying shares in the building,

437
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.580
but now you're tied in with the whole building.

438
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:30.960
So basically if your neighbor's enough of your neighbors go bankrupt and the

439
00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:32.640
whole,
the whole building goes under,

440
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.650
you lose your shares and you either have to move out of your apartment or you go

441
00:27:37.651 --> 00:27:41.250
back to renting it and you're like,
wait a minute,
I thought I bought it.
No,
no,

442
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:43.980
no sir.
You bought shares in the building.

443
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:50.130
You paid your way.
But these other cons didn't.
And because they didn't,

444
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.740
you go down to the bottom of the lagoon with them.

445
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.380
That to me is what the European Union is,
right?
And that's what banks want.
Right?

446
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:02.430
And they just fucking bankrupt him.
And,
uh,
I dunno what the fuck they do.

447
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.840
They play that little fucking game.

448
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:06.500
They buy low and then they fucking go high and I'll fuck,

449
00:28:06.501 --> 00:28:09.390
could they pull the money out and everybody falls in their fucking ass and then

450
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:13.680
they got another castle.
You know?
I think that that's how the economy works,

451
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.390
right?
And it's all run by shape shifters.
Okay.

452
00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.620
Just shit like that.
You know what I mean?

453
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.820
Especially when I'm in London and those stupid fucking critics show up

454
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.130
it fucking guys,
critics of the fucking worse.
There's nothing you can do.

455
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.670
There's no show that you can have that they're not going to rip the shit out of

456
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:39.270
it.
And it just fucking hilarious to me.
It's like I don't need critics.
All right.

457
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:44.190
If I wanted to feel bad about having a good show,
I just call my mom.
Oh,

458
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:47.640
fucking need you to be doing her job.
All right.
Whatever.
All right.

459
00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:52.560
July 31st everybody.
Dublin,
Ireland.
All right.

460
00:28:52.561 --> 00:28:56.940
Then August 1st I'm in Belfast.
I've never been there.
Belfast,
Ireland.

461
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.710
The fuck is his Belfast UK.
All right.
It's Ireland.

462
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.170
I think it's about time England got the fuck out of there.
Um,

463
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.060
can you imagine saying that as American seriously?
You know,

464
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.890
is we're putting up cheesecake factories in the Middle East.
All right.

465
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.860
August 1st,
Belfast UK.

466
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:22.830
Um,
August 2nd,
I'm in Galway,
Ireland,
uh,

467
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.570
which is way out on the west coast and evidently the closest airport is like a

468
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.540
fucking hour away from it.
So I don't understand what this is.
This is seems like,

469
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:35.820
should I ruin it?
And it actually fucking Google some pictures of it.
Galway,

470
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.990
Ireland.
Let's see,
we got here.
Okay.
Oh

471
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.790
my God.
Jesus cry.
I know it.
I know.
This is going to be one of these fucking,
uh,

472
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:52.580
which is a warlock,
one of those fucking movies type cities.
Harry Potter.

473
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:56.810
Look at this fucking place.
Oh my God.

474
00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.430
I'm only spending a day there.

475
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.313
<v 3>Okay.</v>

476
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.160
<v 0>Wow.
Look at the fucking castles.</v>

477
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:07.120
Holy Shit.

478
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:09.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

479
00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.560
<v 0>I'm going to drive in there,
do the show,</v>

480
00:30:11.561 --> 00:30:15.070
and then I got to drive right back so I can make my flight.

481
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.080
What the fuck am I going?

482
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.623
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

483
00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.940
<v 0>Did I fuck it up?
What am I going next?
All right,
I'll go to a all,</v>

484
00:30:22.941 --> 00:30:27.320
then I fly to a Bristol,
England,

485
00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.850
and then Manchester,
England.
The,
a sober,

486
00:30:31.851 --> 00:30:36.410
sophisticated Manchester.
I'm thinking that's going to be a nice mellow crowd

487
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.310
fucking loaded takes.
Um,
that's what I'm anticipating.
A Manchester.
I,

488
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.760
I'm anticipating they're going to be a bunch of fucking lunatic switches.

489
00:30:46.761 --> 00:30:51.650
A which is fine by me.
I um,
I grew up Massachusetts,
you know,

490
00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:57.620
London,
England,
August 5th and August six with the country critics.
Uh,

491
00:30:57.621 --> 00:31:02.540
August 7th,
I'll be in Amsterdam and then August 8th,

492
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.940
I will be in Edinburgh,
uh,
for two shows.

493
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.930
All right.
So we got a late show too.
Okay.
Um,

494
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.070
then I got a couple of days off,
well,

495
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.040
be hanging out with other orange headed conflict myself.
And then August 11th,
um,

496
00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:24.020
in Germany,
Cologne,
Germany,
bodywash,
Germany.

497
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.150
Then August 12th,
I'm in Antwerp,
Belgium.
Oh look at this.

498
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:33.500
August 27,
I'm in Reno,
Reno,
Nevada,

499
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:35.810
Reno,
Nevada.

500
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:40.870
And at that point we will be only a couple of months away from that fucking

501
00:31:42.321 --> 00:31:45.170
kitchen TV square headed,
fucking safe,

502
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:52.550
crazy eyes smiling psycho from becoming the next fucking president of the United

503
00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.780
States.
Oh,
that's going to be a rough one.

504
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.810
Watching all these ladies saying how fucking,

505
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.850
what an important date is for women.

506
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.370
I guess it will be because a woman to be elected president,

507
00:32:02.371 --> 00:32:06.570
this is just my prediction here.
All right.
But,
uh,
Jesus Christ couldn't,

508
00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:09.960
we have gotten one that didn't have 58 pending fucking felonies.

509
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:15.300
That's not a red flag to anybody,
you know,

510
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.750
I dunno.
What are you going to do?
Those are our choices.
I don't know why

511
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.750
a fucking maniac who,
uh,
you know,
it doesn't know how to use email properly.

512
00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:31.110
You know,
sending out secrets to a French.

513
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.990
Um,
and that's some fucking guy who's a,
I dunno,

514
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.920
who really should just be a carnival barker.

515
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.300
I feel like Trump should just standing next to some impossible game to when

516
00:32:41.301 --> 00:32:44.070
talking about how it's the greatest game ever.
You know,

517
00:32:44.071 --> 00:32:47.210
who's he hits on underage chicks.
Um,
I don't know.
That's just,
just,

518
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:49.360
just the opinions of somebody who,
uh,

519
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.150
can't pronounce words while he reads out loud.
What he say,
what he say they cleo.

520
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.940
That's the,
uh,
that's the podcast here for this,
uh,
this Thursday afternoon.

521
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.193
<v 4>MMM.</v>

522
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.400
<v 0>Could sell.
Oh,
I,
you know what?
Somebody please send me a fucking,</v>

523
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:11.500
whatever you call a Photoshop picture of fucking Rappaport's face on Danny
Ainge,

524
00:33:11.501 --> 00:33:14.850
his body when he played for the Celtics.
I really want to see that to it.

525
00:33:14.851 --> 00:33:18.130
You can do whatever the fuck you want to do with my head.
You know,

526
00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.560
I don't give a fuck.
That's it.
All right.
I got to go hit the elliptical.

527
00:33:23.561 --> 00:33:26.710
So I'm not a fucking fat fuck at the end of this writing season here.

528
00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:32.170
Congratulations to Kevin Durant.
Um,
on your next,
uh,

529
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.610
on your,
on your first championship ring.
You know,

530
00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.440
I want to put together a standup tour like that.
You know what I mean?

531
00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.560
I want to join like the,
uh,

532
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:45.940
like if Louis C CK and Dave ship Dave Chappelle would doing like a stand up
tour,

533
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:51.460
I'd somehow like,
I know know,
I don't know.
I do like their neck standup specials.

534
00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:56.170
I'll splice part of my hour in there.
Get credit.

535
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.440
Uh,
all right,
that's it.
Um,
you guys have a great weekend.
Your conscience

536
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.680
<v 5>and I'll,
I'll talk to you on Monday.</v>

537
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:09.250
Enjoy the music and another half hour of Monday morning podcast back from

538
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:10.424
yesteryear.

539
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:49.803
<v 6>Z.</v>

540
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:03.250
Let's see

541
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.513

542

<v 5>Wait,</v>

543
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.523
<v 7>Jeez.</v>

544
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.540
<v 8>Hey,
what's going on?
And uh,</v>

545
00:35:23.541 --> 00:35:27.120
this is the Monday morning podcast that I'm actually doing from my home home

546
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.820
phone rather than my cell phone.

547
00:35:29.821 --> 00:35:34.650
I finally figured out how to call him this,
this,
this,
this,
my space.

548
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.970
A fucking Jesus Christ.

549
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.580
I'm having one of those weeks.
All right.
I just talk.

550
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:44.910
I just babbled for 12 minutes and decided that I didn't like it and I have to

551
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:49.050
fucking start all over again.
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.

552
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.610
Do you think I want to do this?
I don't want to fucking do this.
You know,

553
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.380
sometimes in life you got to do what you got.
Yeah.

554
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:59.040
You'd only you just fucking podcast man.

555
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.740
How long these things take?
Some weeks I get on here,
you know,
I just babbled.

556
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:08.130
It's just,
it's fucking gold.
Just half hour just running my God damn mouth.

557
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:11.610
I don't even have to think.
And then there's other times it's,
it's just,

558
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.610
it's like shoveling wet snow.
And you know what,

559
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.460
I'm fucking stick in this one out because I'm not going to start over again.

560
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:21.540
Eight sometimes.
You know what?
Sometimes you just not that funny.
You fucking,

561
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.970
mine's broken up or whatever.
I don't know.

562
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:28.140
Let's just get down to goddamn brass tacks here and I'll let you know what I got

563
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:32.640
going on.
All right.
My name is bill bar.
This is my myspace page.

564
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:37.620
This is my Monday morning podcast.
I do one of these every God damn week.
Okay.

565
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:42.010
It's try to give people a nice laugh to start off to fucking weeks and uh,

566
00:36:42.011 --> 00:36:43.440
and we start off in a good mood.

567
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.340
And then I ended up getting frustrated with my own ineptness and then I ended up

568
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:52.040
just fucking,
I dunno,
ended up snapping and I say fuck a lot.
All right.

569
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:56.910
And uh,
okay,
let's get on with people asked me questions,
I answer them.

570
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.250
Look at me.
I'm just,
you know,
I'm just blowing through this.

571
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.810
Just blowing through the explanations.
I usually take my time and explain this.

572
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.890
You know what this is like.

573
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.460
You ever like break your arm or something and you go to school.

574
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:12.120
The next day instance,
the first kid goes,
hey man,
what happened to your arm?

575
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:16.680
Right?
And you give them every last fucking detail.
Okay?

576
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:21.300
But then by the time you've told the fucking story,
it said like the 12th person.

577
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.080
By the time the 13th person comes up to you,
you're like,
I fucking fell down.

578
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.570
All right.
What the fuck you think happened?
You know,

579
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.870
that's the mindset I'm in right now as I do this podcast.

580
00:37:30.871 --> 00:37:35.871
After just blow in 12 minutes of arise and call him on my home phone.

581
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.050
Um,
all right,
here we go.
Let's get down with this shit here.
Let's get,

582
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.900
get on with it.

583
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.900
I put up a new video because I am desperately trying to get myself to become

584
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.730
part of the new millennium.
It's right underneath the podcast.
If you look there,

585
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:55.380
you'll see a very blurry,
very blurry me and a Winnipeg jets shirt,
by the way,

586
00:37:55.381 --> 00:37:58.430
cause I'm old school,
old school hooky.
Um,

587
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.260
let's meet at the punchline in Atlanta and before you watch the video,

588
00:38:01.261 --> 00:38:04.470
I just want to give you a little backstory.
What happened.
Uh,
I was actually,

589
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:09.180
it was Thursday night and a couple of weeks ago and it's one of my favorite

590
00:38:09.181 --> 00:38:12.690
clubs now.
It's just having one of these awesome sets where I was,
uh,

591
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.800
I was really open and free and everything was just flowing as opposed to this

592
00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:20.820
podcast,
which feels very arduous,
very work like that.

593
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:21.900
I used that word correctly.

594
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:26.250
Want to fuck is quest love wearing those fucking lime green pants?

595
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.170
I just realized that,
um,
anyways,
I was having one of these,
um,

596
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.431
one of these just,
you know,

597
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:35.980
really open just great sets and I was about 12 minutes in and everybody was

598
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:38.710
laughing.
Everybody's having a good time.
I was having a good time,

599
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:43.300
but for some reason there was this lady in the crowd and it wasn't enough that

600
00:38:43.301 --> 00:38:45.220
she felt my jokes were funny.

601
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.610
She was somehow agreeing with the things that I was saying on stage.

602
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.330
So rather than laughing at the end of every joke,

603
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.650
you know,
when the punchline came out,
instead of laughing,

604
00:38:56.651 --> 00:39:01.450
she would just yell out Sankyo after every joke,

605
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.430
you know,

606
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.220
the rest of the crowd was booby laughing and then I would just hear this woman's

607
00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:08.620
voiceover,
everybody thank Yo.

608
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.790
So this video picks up about 12 minutes into my set.

609
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:18.160
She's already,
I'll tag yo like fucking 12 times.
And I feel it annoying.

610
00:39:18.161 --> 00:39:21.010
That is with me saying that to you.
Just imagine being on stage,

611
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.900
trying to keep the crowd,

612
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.740
trying to keep the fucking plates spinning and somebody keeps yelling that shit

613
00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:31.450
out.
So she yells it out for I guess basically the sixth time.

614
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:35.230
And that's when I finally snapped.
I snapped in a good way.

615
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:38.890
I was proud of myself where I didn't shop her head off and be overly mean.

616
00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.940
It's kind of mean,
but it was definitely funny.
And,
um,

617
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.870
I just want to let you guys know I'm,

618
00:39:44.871 --> 00:39:48.410
I'm going to start taping all my sets because,
uh,
you know,

619
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.700
I riff a lot and I end up,
you know,

620
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:55.180
missing a lot of good lines that I could keep in my act and also random shit

621
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:59.360
happens and I'm going to start posting some of the random shit that,
that,
uh,

622
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.510
happens up here.
Um,
unless people really start to enjoy these.

623
00:40:04.511 --> 00:40:07.390
And then they come out to my shows and then they deliberately tried to yell out

624
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:09.640
something,
which is always the risk of it.

625
00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:12.520
But basically I like doing this kind of thing because I want to give you guys

626
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:16.240
some new,
some new laughs without having to burn any material.

627
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:19.150
You know what I mean?
I mean,
I'm not Trent Reznor here.

628
00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:22.660
I can't just give away my new hour for free,
you know,

629
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.630
like he can,
I'm jealous and musicians,
right?

630
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:28.510
They can just fucking put the goddamn music out for free now.

631
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:33.340
And then everybody comes to their shows and when they know all the words,

632
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:37.690
they get to sing along.
So it's different than he can go,
you know,

633
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:40.570
we're going to break it down in Detroit,
can break it down here.
Right.

634
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:43.600
And then he'd been in,
he slows the fucking song down and then everybody go,

635
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:46.640
whatever.
It brings the music level down and everybody thinks along,

636
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:47.830
you can't do that with jokes.

637
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.880
Maybe if I started singing my jokes and then I'll do that.

638
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:56.650
I'll come with a fucking Ukulele on stage,
you know,

639
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.160
if I could fucking sing.
That's why guitar x blow up,

640
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:02.980
man telling you fucking telling you.

641
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.490
I heard about some kid in Massachusetts.
He's the kid.
Uh,

642
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:10.420
he's been putting funny songs up on Youtube for the last year and he just sold

643
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:14.620
out the comedy connection.
It's like 17 fucking years old,
you know,
long.

644
00:41:14.621 --> 00:41:18.100
It took me to sell out to common connection,
15 fucking years telling jokes.

645
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.500
You know why?
Because I don't sing.
I would just sing my God damn jokes.

646
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:28.390
What's the deal with labs?
Everybody,

647
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.920
if I would just do that,
I would just do that.
I don't know you,

648
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.460
I dunno what would happen.
You know,
something you always want to think,
you know.

649
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.680
I just did that.
Then I'd be here.
You'd ever think of all the failed guitar acts?

650
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.460
You know the ones that you guys don't see?
You just see the successful ones.

651
00:41:46.461 --> 00:41:50.180
You know the ones with their half hour specials,
the ones selling out theaters.

652
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.350
All right.
You don't see the ones that opened for me when I go to Portland,

653
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:58.640
Oregon,
or at least when I did back in the day,
way back in the day,

654
00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.540
10 years ago,
he's played a club called Harvey's.
Oh,
I remember.
It was,

655
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:04.760
the walls were green and the guy used to,

656
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.820
he used to give the whole show away,

657
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:13.310
which basically he would have telemarketers call people up and just be like,
Hey,

658
00:42:13.311 --> 00:42:14.144
guess what?

659
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.410
You've won tickets to what you want for free tickets to a comedy show.

660
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.040
And the people would be like,
Holy Shit,
how the fuck did I win?

661
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:26.270
Knows I didn't even enter the contest,
you know?
Well,

662
00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:31.070
you won them because a comedy was not selling well 10 years ago.

663
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.470
So these,
to give them,
basically they've given away the show.

664
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.780
He'd walk into this fucking place.
It'd be a Tuesday,
you know,
I'd come Mosey and,

665
00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:40.910
and I'm thinking,
I'll write the Tuesday.
It'll be half full.

666
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:44.000
Knows who the fuck I am.
I lean on the mic stand,
I'll riff.

667
00:42:44.001 --> 00:42:44.900
I'll gets the new jokes.

668
00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.140
And you would walk in there and you would think that Springsteen was going to

669
00:42:48.141 --> 00:42:48.830
come on.

670
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:53.830
It was jam packed 400 fucking drunk ass people who didn't know me and did not

671
00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:57.950
give a shit whether the show was good or not really,

672
00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.220
because they already felt like they had,
they had already want,

673
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:04.100
they got free tickets.
So you would go up there and it would just be,

674
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:08.370
it'd be a fucking zoo who would be an absolute zoo and a,

675
00:43:08.371 --> 00:43:11.870
a lot of lumberjack that,
that was the vibe I got.
You know,

676
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:15.440
Oregon has a lot of trees and he'd be down there in Portland and you'd be

677
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:20.180
thinking,
all right,
it's very crunchy,
very sort of progressive.
But,

678
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:22.430
uh,
you know,
those cops don't come out to shows.

679
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.940
The lumberjacks would come out and they'd be screaming and yelling and eaten

680
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:30.800
burgers that would have fried eggs on the top of them.
And,
uh,

681
00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:33.500
and it sucked.
And I don't even know why I'm talking about that.

682
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.520
I already forgot I spaced halfway through that fucking story because,
um,

683
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.690
cause that's the mindset I'm in this week.
I,
you know what it is,

684
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.820
I got a zillion fucking things I got to take care of because I'm on my way to

685
00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:48.770
Pittsburgh this week and I'm flying in a day early,
uh,
to do,
um,

686
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.890
I'm doing a lot of radio this week cause I'm going to try to sell that fucking

687
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:56.750
place out.
I want to be on our wd VIII with Randy Bowman this week.

688
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.530
Um,
and if I had any fucking brains,

689
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:02.450
I would have looked that up and giving you the,
I don't know,

690
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:07.080
it's 100 points something.
I think if you live in Pittsburgh,

691
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.860
you can listen to me and I'll be honest.
Say you listened to me in the morning,

692
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.020
Wednesday morning,
Thursday morning and Friday morning,

693
00:44:12.021 --> 00:44:13.190
and then he'd come out on the weekend,

694
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.810
he check out my show just for the love of God.
Just come up to my goddamn shit.

695
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.930
Okay.
I don't know.
Fucking,
I don't want to tell you.
Um,
please,

696
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:22.120
I don't want to stand there alone.
I can't,

697
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.760
that that mall is the most depressing fucking mall in America for those of you

698
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:30.250
who've never been to it,
that Pittsburgh Improv is an a mall called the stack.

699
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.170
Um,
why do they call it the stacks?
Basically?

700
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.620
Because I guess the mall used to be a steel mill.

701
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.391
Okay.

702
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:44.040
When we used to have industry and this country before they started telling us

703
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:47.490
that everything was too expensive to make in this country.
So they had the,

704
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:52.050
you know,
ship it to a third world country and have some eight year old kid,

705
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.660
kid make fucking spittoons or whatever the fuck it is.

706
00:44:54.661 --> 00:44:58.560
You make a goddamn steel steel mill,
right.
Rather than being like,

707
00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:02.910
now all Americans are involved with unions and they want health insurance and

708
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:05.880
they want to get paid for their work.
They,
they,
they just,

709
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:08.730
they just fucking picked up and left.
But this is what they did.

710
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:13.050
They knocked down the factory,
but they,
uh,

711
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:17.340
they kept the stacks.
Just to remind you that,

712
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:20.100
that people,
uh,
you know,
there's this reminded me,

713
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:26.730
might even be a poltergeist.
You know,
you move the headstones,

714
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.140
but she's had moved the bodies.

715
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.860
That's what they did at that mall.
They moved the factory,

716
00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:36.720
but they left the smokestacks.

717
00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:43.040
That's what they did to remind you that hardworking Americans used to have jobs

718
00:45:43.561 --> 00:45:48.561
there and they could support their families and they made shit out of steel that

719
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:52.950
other Americans would then buy.
Okay?

720
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:57.300
And the dollar was worth something,
but they got rid of all that.

721
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.360
They shipped it somewhere else.
And in it's wake,

722
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:05.570
they left fucking cheesecake factory's lucky jeans and the fucking cold stone

723
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:07.044
creamery.

724
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.110
But in tribute to all those people that they fucked over,
they left the chimneys.

725
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.573
Isn't that nice?

726
00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.350
A little nod to the past and now they're fucking kids.

727
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:21.810
What are they doing?
What are they,
where do they work

728
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.440
given notice that when you meet people and they come up to you,

729
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.810
you ask him what the fuck they do.
You don't even get to kitty.

730
00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.920
You don't even know what it is.
What do you do?

731
00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:35.460
I worked in a steel mill.
Okay.
You work in a mill,
the steel there,

732
00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:38.610
and you work there.
So you work with steel in a mill.
I get that.

733
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.480
I understand what that job is.
What do you do?
I'm the Milkman.
Okay.
You're a man.

734
00:46:43.481 --> 00:46:48.060
There's milk and you fucking deliver it,
man.
You're the Milkman.
I get it.

735
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.523
I fucking get it.

736
00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.920
You realize how many jobs there are that people actually understand what the

737
00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:57.420
fuck it is you do now.
There's very few left.
I'm a mail man.
I'm a man.

738
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.170
I delivered mail.
I'm the fucking mailman back then.
They was simple,

739
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.050
simple fucking names.
All right.

740
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.380
I'm a silver Smith.
All right?
Smith meaning,
uh,

741
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.620
like to,
to hit with a hammer,
like smile and I'll do it with silver.

742
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.000
A fucking silver Smith.
All right.
There wasn't any,
the A,

743
00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:22.830
I'm the regional director of the fucking,
you know,
so I can't even,

744
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:27.060
I can't even give you an example of somebody's job.
I'm trying to think of the,

745
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.260
all these computer.

746
00:47:28.261 --> 00:47:32.770
I sit in a cubicle and make somebody else's dream happen.

747
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.220
I'm telling you right now,
man,
it's just sitting in a fucking cubicle.

748
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:41.230
Just do something rebellious today.
Just take one of the screws out of your fake.

749
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.730
I don't really have an office wall that they put in front of you to make you

750
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:47.350
feel like you have half an office.

751
00:47:47.351 --> 00:47:51.750
But the reality is they don't want you looking at other people.
You know,

752
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.400
I think I've talked about this before.
You guys ever see that movie,

753
00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:57.820
the apartment starring a Jack Lemmon.

754
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.100
If you see the beginning of that movie,

755
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:04.300
that's what the cubicle area used to look like.
You still had a sea of people,

756
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:05.741
you know,

757
00:48:05.741 --> 00:48:09.970
slugging away looking like a bunch of goddamn salmon swimming upstream with

758
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:11.470
fucking typewriters in front of them.

759
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.430
But they didn't have walls around them like they were on punishment.
You know,

760
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.790
you could look at the person next to you shoot the shit,

761
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.960
but then somewhere along the line they let us know that they're fucking talking.

762
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.010
We can't have them looking at themselves.

763
00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.870
They're literally treating you like children
and said,
I don't know.

764
00:48:28.871 --> 00:48:31.990
It's just fucking,
it just blows my mind.
You know what I mean?
I,
I,
I,

765
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:37.300
I'd rather sell drugs.
All right.
Um,
so anyways,
this is the,
yeah,

766
00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:41.060
this is the Monday morning podcast and a,
if people send me questions,

767
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:45.340
if you knew to my page,
if you haven't defected to fucking Facebook,

768
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.820
like the fact that you are,
you know what I mean?

769
00:48:48.821 --> 00:48:50.890
I love all these people go on to Facebook now.
Like,

770
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:56.400
like the same herd of assholes that went from Friendster to my space.

771
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:01.930
Isn't,
isn't gonna,
you know,
they're not going to eventually end up over there.

772
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:06.460
Like there's not going to be a bunch of spam about ringtones and a bunch of

773
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:09.640
whores with the butt cracks and that titties hanging out,
you know,

774
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:15.160
sending you generic emails trying to make it seem like they didn't send it to

775
00:49:15.161 --> 00:49:16.120
everybody else,

776
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:20.320
but you realize that they did because rather than calling you by your name,

777
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:24.010
it just says,
Hey,
you love your page

778
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:26.261
by the way,

779
00:49:26.261 --> 00:49:30.960
I'm the fucking Nokia phone whore or the month or whatever the hell they,

780
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.590
you know,
all the stupid beauty contest things that they go to when,
um,

781
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.290
I'm sticking it out here,
man.
All right.

782
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.900
And all you guys who all going over to Facebook,
you know,
what you liked,

783
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:43.900
you liked that.
You ever see that movie the titanic,
when as those guys,

784
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.080
you know who fucking jumped in into the RAF's all by themselves,

785
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.840
they'll Celsus sons of bitches who were actually smart,

786
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:54.160
who listened to that voice that says,
I need to fucking survive.
Well,

787
00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:57.010
maybe they are smart.
Then maybe they realize that my space,

788
00:49:57.011 --> 00:50:00.100
maybe my space is a sinking ship.
You know?

789
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:02.501
I don't know.

790
00:50:02.501 --> 00:50:05.860
That'd be actually kind of funny now because they've already made their money

791
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:08.830
off it.
Rupert Murdoch already brought about this thing.
You mean $1 billion?

792
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:13.180
Every fucking content.
Um,
alright,

793
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.710
I answer questions here.
I'm really just babbling here.
Um,

794
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.270
I answered questions here every week.
People send me questions.
Um,

795
00:50:22.271 --> 00:50:26.370
I try to answer them to the best of my ability.
And uh,
here we go here,

796
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.950
there the podcast.
So the week,
um,
oh,
and by the way,

797
00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:31.820
when you watch my video,

798
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:34.310
could you please send me a comment if you like it or whatever.

799
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:36.110
Cause that's like a new thing that I really want to start doing.

800
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:41.090
Just putting some random moments up there like that.
Um,
so,
so let me,
let me know.

801
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:43.910
Let me know what you think.
Okay.
Question number one.
Hey Bill,

802
00:50:43.911 --> 00:50:46.910
which one was better?
Mike Richters insane.

803
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:49.960
Safe Against Pawel Bureau.

804
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.940
That's how you saying Pablo Obra never know what to say.

805
00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.400
These Russian guys names.
It's insane.

806
00:50:55.401 --> 00:51:00.401
Save against his penalty shot or Patrick wa Mike Vernon going at its center

807
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:05.160
rice.
I'm definitely gonna say Mike Richter,
just because,
uh,
that was,

808
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.950
that was one of the best years ever in hockey.

809
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:12.020
That was like 2004 when the red sox finally wanted to watch the rangers finally

810
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:16.280
when the cup and everybody go crazy.
That was just an amazing moment.
And,
uh,

811
00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:21.080
the Patrick,
while Mike Berning thin,
you know,
I don't know,
was it,
you know,

812
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:25.250
it was a great fight.
It's great to see Patrick while loose,
but you know,

813
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.340
that owns for the Stanley Cup.

814
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:33.140
And I remember watching that 1994 and watching the rangers went in.

815
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:37.880
I remember thinking clearly that's what it's going to be like when the red sox,

816
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:42.140
if they ever get their heads out of their asses and they finally fucking win
one,

817
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.530
that that's going to be what it's like.
So,
uh,

818
00:51:45.531 --> 00:51:49.490
I was living vicariously and for some reason I didn't hate the Rangers for the

819
00:51:49.491 --> 00:51:53.930
simple fact that I was not old enough when the rangers last time,

820
00:51:53.931 --> 00:51:57.050
the Rangers Bruins rivalry was great,
which was back in the 70s.

821
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:58.810
I was still just a,

822
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:04.150
just a little lad with a big Motha fucking red hair looking like that dude Jody

823
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.650
on a family affair.
All right.

824
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.920
And that's why I became a comedian because that's who the fuck I look like.

825
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:14.750
And I got the shit kicked out of me.
Um,
all right,
question number two,
Bill.

826
00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:19.580
How the hell does Paris Hilton keep getting movie roles?
Well,

827
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:24.770
I actually thought about this one and I think the reason that she keeps getting

828
00:52:24.771 --> 00:52:29.510
movie roles is because,
uh,
not to be crude,

829
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:33.680
but,
uh,
she's not afraid to show the clamp,
you know?

830
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:38.000
And uh,
I think,
uh,

831
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:41.780
you know,
I think that's how,
that's how you got to do it sometimes as a woman,

832
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.930
you gotta you gotta just every once in a while you just got to take your pussy

833
00:52:44.931 --> 00:52:48.500
up,
you know,
and,
uh,
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

834
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:52.520
Sharon Stone did it.
Sharon Stone was,
you know,

835
00:52:52.521 --> 00:52:57.170
meandering around all these fucking B movies.
She,
you know,

836
00:52:57.171 --> 00:53:00.440
she had it halfway decent role in some sort of Schwartz and angle movie,

837
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:04.730
but it wasn't until she showed the clam that people's,
you know,

838
00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.880
sat up and took notice.
Next thing you know,

839
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:11.150
she's in that movie casino and delivered one of the best performances.

840
00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.320
I thought she,
she,
she was,
she nominated for an Oscar.
She should've won,

841
00:53:14.321 --> 00:53:15.154
won that year.

842
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:19.220
But that's when showing the clam kind of harder because all the other women

843
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:21.350
resented her.
You know what I mean?

844
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:25.100
They thought that she was a whore rather than she did what she had to do.

845
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:29.580
And I don't understand what women get upset
when they're like,

846
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:34.800
you know,
you're treating me like a a,
you know,

847
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:38.340
like a sexual object and it's like you are a sexual object.

848
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.090
You know what I mean?
That's like you.
I'm like,

849
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:46.260
oh you're just fucking using me because I can pick up heavy shit.

850
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:50.940
I can't pick up.
I mean,
not extra heavy shit but heavier shit.

851
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.910
Cause I'm a guy,
you know,

852
00:53:53.911 --> 00:53:57.000
that's where Hillary Clinton fucked up her campaign.

853
00:53:57.001 --> 00:54:00.930
When she fucking put on the pants suit,
you know,

854
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.830
she should have sex that up a little vamped it up.

855
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:09.030
God gave you Teddy's use them show low cleavage.

856
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.330
You know what I mean?
That's what she should've done.
And people,
you know,

857
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:15.510
if you think that's still on,
it's stupid.
You know,

858
00:54:15.511 --> 00:54:18.600
guys don't get elected because of their brains.

859
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:23.820
Bill Clinton got elected because he played the saxophone on fucking Arsenio
Hall.

860
00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.790
And when our CTO came in to do the black handshake,

861
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:30.360
somehow Bill Clinton was able to do it without fucking breaking his wrist.

862
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:34.260
And I think that right there was,
when was,
when was the turning of it?

863
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.250
What else did he do?
He just sat there smiling with his mouth open,

864
00:54:38.251 --> 00:54:41.700
going change America wants change.
He didn't say anything.

865
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.590
He played the fucking saxophone.
So if you're a woman,
you know,

866
00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.130
show little titty share a little tinny,
that's all.
That's all I can tell you.

867
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.650
Oh God,
I'm so ignorant.
All right.
Uh,
question number three.
Uh,
Bill.

868
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:00.180
Uh,
but,
but I put down what the fuck is this one?
Um,
all right,

869
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:03.330
thanks for answering my questions or this is an up and coming comedian and I

870
00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:08.331
competed in a funniest person contest in a city that I will not,

871
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:12.420
I'm not going to name cause I don't get this person in trouble just in case one

872
00:55:12.421 --> 00:55:15.750
of my 14 listeners is the club owner of that.
Anyways,

873
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:19.560
the owner said that he would not hire any of the comedians to work for any of

874
00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:21.360
the clubs because we were too vulgar.

875
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.290
The crazy thing is I noticed that it was an older crowd,

876
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:29.640
but I was being stubborn and decided to do my normal routine,

877
00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:32.610
which is some dirty jokes.
And your opinion,

878
00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:37.611
do you think you're selling out if you adjust your comedic style to get into the

879
00:55:37.951 --> 00:55:42.150
big corporate clubs?
Um,
okay.

880
00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:46.980
Um,
all right.
I know what you're saying here.
I've done the same thing.
Um,

881
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:51.600
I've looked out in the crowd going,
okay,
this is what I want to talk about.

882
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.920
You look at them,
you judge them and you go,
well,
I'm going to be eating my balls,

883
00:55:55.921 --> 00:56:00.450
at least 40% of my set if I stick with what I want to do.

884
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.840
And um,
yeah,

885
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:08.790
when you want 100% adjust your act,
you yeah.
You definitely,

886
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:13.590
yeah.
You feel dirty,
you know,
not,
not them,
not to use a pun there,
but yeah.

887
00:56:13.591 --> 00:56:16.470
You don't feel good.
But,
uh,

888
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:20.430
it isn't 100% selling out if,
you know,
I don't know.

889
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:23.770
It's one of those weird things where it's your own judgment call.

890
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.610
You know what I mean?
Because I used to do those Naca things for the,

891
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:32.070
for those of you who aren't comedians here,
they have these things every year.
Um,

892
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.720
these,
these national showcases for college gigs.

893
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:39.580
And when I used to showcase for them,
I would go up and I would just do my act,

894
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.100
you know?
And I remember one year,

895
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.570
something that was going on in my act was the first time I got,
you know,

896
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:49.240
an HIV test.
And I was talking about the fear of it,
which is,

897
00:56:49.241 --> 00:56:52.630
and it's really not a joke that you want to do when a college showcase.

898
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:57.550
He just want to do you're happy shit.
And I did.
And I was like,
fuck dead man,

899
00:56:57.551 --> 00:57:01.360
I'm fucking selling out.
So I went up there and I did my shit.

900
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.230
And you know what?
I got zero schools and I just got people,

901
00:57:05.231 --> 00:57:08.590
they kept coming up to me going,
we think you're hilarious.
You know,

902
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:12.280
they kept getting the whole world,
who was up to me,
I book you,

903
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.560
but I can't because of blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

904
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.250
And what I learned was sometimes you gotta play the game a little bit.

905
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:22.960
So what I would then do was I would go up,
after that,

906
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:27.610
I would go up and do a squeaky clean set.
Then I would book the colleges.

907
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.020
And then when I went to the colleges,

908
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:33.250
I would actually then do my act and then do the shit that I wanted to talk
about.

909
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:36.540
So in a weird way,
I actually want,

910
00:57:36.541 --> 00:57:40.030
cause I got the money and I still got to do what I wanted to do.

911
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.160
And I got people to hear the material,

912
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.730
more people to hear the material that I wanted them to hear.

913
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.990
I just had to be a,
I had wore myself out,
you know,

914
00:57:49.991 --> 00:57:54.180
I had to put on a Tuxedo for like fucking five,
six minutes cheesy.

915
00:57:54.181 --> 00:57:58.900
You just brought up a really bad fucking memory.
Um,
no,
but dude,
I would say,

916
00:57:58.901 --> 00:58:01.420
you know,
on your way up.
Yeah.
Nobody wants,
you know,

917
00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:04.210
a lot of headliners don't want to go on in front of a guy who kills.

918
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:07.310
And they also don't want to go on in front of a guy who's,
you know,
if you,

919
00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:12.340
if you're being a little dirty,
that gives them an excuse to kind of be like,

920
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:15.970
not just say that I can't follow this guy.
There'll be like,
oh,

921
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:20.440
he's just being dirty.
So,
uh,
yeah,
play the game a little bit.
You know,

922
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:23.470
you play the game a little bit and then it is people get to know who you are.

923
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:28.150
You get way more leeway and uh,
eventually,
uh,
you get to,

924
00:58:28.151 --> 00:58:29.560
do you think,
you know what I mean?

925
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:32.710
It's one of those things you gotta be like a tree,
you know,
bend but don't break.

926
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.940
You know,
I dunno,
do whatever the fuck you want to do,
but you know,
uh,

927
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:40.180
I don't know.
That's my 2 cents.
I don't fucking know.

928
00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:41.810
I have no confidence in my God damn opinion,

929
00:58:41.811 --> 00:58:44.290
so I don't even know why you people ask me questions.
All right.

930
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:45.640
Question number four.
Ah,
Bill,

931
00:58:45.641 --> 00:58:49.450
have you been approached about doing any shows since your skits on Chappelle?

932
00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:54.850
Um,
yeah,
catch one every year and I try to get them on TV.
But um,

933
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.390
for those of you who always asked me,
how come you don't have your own TV show?

934
00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.370
Um,
because it's really hard.
It's all I can tell you.

935
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.360
Okay.
It's very hard to get a show on TV because believe it or not,

936
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:12.100
a lot of people want to get a show on television because you can make a lot of

937
00:59:12.101 --> 00:59:16.420
money.
So A,
I keep getting closer.
Keep getting closer.

938
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:20.530
I'm a bell.
What do you think about Shaq's rap about Colby?

939
00:59:20.531 --> 00:59:24.470
Who was the d bag and this never ending saga?

940
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.440
I think Shaq was just fucking around.
I thought he was joking,

941
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:31.820
but he wasn't joking,
but he was joking.
You know what I mean?
I mean,

942
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.120
if somebody gets arrested for a potential rape and they bring my name up during

943
00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:40.580
it,
you know,
um,

944
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:43.720
I think I have the license to give him shit for a while.

945
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:49.390
And if I'm in a club and I want to fucking make fun of them a little bit.

946
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:53.090
Yeah,
I dunno.
I just looked at Chuck's face.

947
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:57.540
I thought he was clearly joking around and it was so over the top.
Colby,
how,

948
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.570
how's my ass taste?
I mean,
I don't know.

949
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.650
How does it take check?
I don't know.

950
01:00:03.651 --> 01:00:06.640
Like you've been running full court for the last 15 years where the disgusting

951
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.750
question.
All right.
Uh,
number five.

952
01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:11.690
We got a lot of questions this week and we try to blow through them.
Um,

953
01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:16.370
well went to the Tempe Improv,
saw this comic.
He was good,

954
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:19.070
but the opening act was killing it.
He was so funny.

955
01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.670
Do you ever get worried or stressed that your openers going to be more funny

956
01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:27.110
than you?
Um,
is there any sort of process you go through picking your opener?

957
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:31.580
Am I worried about them being more funny?
Uh,
well,
no,
no,
I'm not.

958
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.330
They're fucking middle acts for a reason.
All right.

959
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.880
If you can't follow a Middle Act,
then you're,
you're not a headliner.

960
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:40.510
I've definitely had some funny guys on in front of me.
Um,

961
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:43.010
but I think that's a good thing.
You know what I mean?

962
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.070
You don't want to be sparring with somebody who sucks because then you're going

963
01:00:47.071 --> 01:00:52.010
to end up sucking.
So I believe in going out with a hit man,
you know,

964
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.100
bringing in a middle act that's,
you know,
funny and an original.

965
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.540
And that's my process to picking an opener.
I use Joe to Rosa,

966
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:02.720
Kevin Shay.
I'm going to be using this guy,

967
01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:07.370
Todd wrecks up in San Francisco.
These guys,
Todd wrecks,
you know in particular,

968
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.750
no disrespect to those other two cops,
but he really fucking kills.

969
01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:14.270
So I'll have my work cut out for me that week.
But uh,
yeah,

970
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.200
I don't want to be that guy.

971
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:18.200
I don't want to have some guy who just goes up there with like a lampshade on

972
01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:22.000
his head and stinks.
While these are a lot of questions here is,

973
01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:24.980
is podcasts getting too long?
All right.
Uh,
it'd be like,

974
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.670
got a question for you podcasts.
Do you ever get a chance to meet George Carlin?

975
01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:33.650
Um,
unfortunately,
no,
I didn't.
I was supposed to meet him.

976
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.460
Um,
when was it?
February or March,
right before he did his specialty.

977
01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:42.530
He's supposed to be doing the comedy and Magic Club down on her most of the

978
01:01:42.531 --> 01:01:46.310
beach.
And I had just done a spot down there and they said,
hey,

979
01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:47.480
he's coming in you whatever.

980
01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.470
On a Wednesday or a Tuesday if you can come down and watch the show and you can

981
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:56.150
meet him afterwards and it was going to be a dream come true.
But,

982
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.790
um,
he ended up getting sick.

983
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:03.110
Obviously his health was failing and uh,
he ended up canceling,

984
01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:07.490
so I never got a chance to meet him.
But I did get a chance to see him and

985
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:12.890
he absolutely blew me away.
And it was actually with a long time.

986
01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:15.950
I was like 20 years ago before I was even doing comedy and a,

987
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:18.680
I did at least get the same cause I never got to see prior.

988
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.100
So at least I can say that I saw him and I'm with him.

989
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:27.870
Passing is really making me want to go see Don Rickles because,
uh,
you know,

990
01:02:27.871 --> 01:02:31.320
that guy's in his eighties and he's still fucking hilarious and a,
I don't know.

991
01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.770
He should,
you know,
the comedian,
I think anybody likes comedy,

992
01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:38.310
he should see those guys.
So,
no,
I did not get a chance to meet him,

993
01:02:38.311 --> 01:02:42.650
but I did get to see him in person and obviously he's,
you can see on my page.

994
01:02:42.651 --> 01:02:47.460
He was a huge influence on me,
obviously.
Um,
all right.

995
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.530
All right.
What are we doing here?

996
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.570
Two more questions and then I'm gonna wrap this fucking thing up.
Number seven,

997
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:54.270
Bill.
Um,
do you,
okay,
I got,

998
01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:57.630
she got a fucking asked advice here on dating.

999
01:02:57.631 --> 01:03:01.470
Do you know I'm fucking not married at 40 and somebody is asking me advice on

1000
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:04.470
relationships.
Okay,
you really need to consider your sources here.

1001
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:09.510
Um,
all right.
That's like,
why don't you go ask somebody on heroin?

1002
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:13.860
Do you think math is bad?
You know,
pain.
And if you like doing it,

1003
01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:16.110
you should fucking do it.
All right,
here we go.
Well,

1004
01:03:16.111 --> 01:03:20.760
do you think a person deserves more than one date to determine if there was

1005
01:03:20.761 --> 01:03:25.650
chemistry?
I recently went out on a date with a guy.
Turns out he wasn't my type.

1006
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.560
Well,
there's your answer right there.
But he had a nice personality,

1007
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.970
but I feel you should know you should feel something immediately.

1008
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:35.640
You're answering your questions.
Uh,

1009
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:39.210
it's not like he was my friend to begin with or will be my friend

1010
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:45.570
that'll have time to grow on me.
I feel very mean and superficial.
Oh,
whoa.

1011
01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:48.660
Okay.
There you go.
Right there.
There's your first mistake with dating.

1012
01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:53.400
When you date,
you have to be unbelievably selfish,
unbelievably selfish,

1013
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.780
or you're not going to get what you want.

1014
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:59.010
And it's not even being selfish because if you settle for something that you

1015
01:03:59.011 --> 01:04:02.100
don't want,
you're not going to be happy.
Okay?

1016
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:04.020
And then you're going to make the other person miserable.

1017
01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:08.100
And that's not fair to the other person.
So fuck that guy.
All right.

1018
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:11.880
Fuck him in his nice personality.
Hook them up with another one of your friends.

1019
01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:14.640
Say,
Hey,
I met a guy that I'm not into,
but he has a nice personality.

1020
01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:18.210
You know what I mean?
That's like a,

1021
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:20.750
that's like watching a TV show that you don't enjoy,

1022
01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:23.970
but you really liked the look of it.
The end of it.

1023
01:04:23.971 --> 01:04:27.360
You don't like the fucking show.
So how long are you going to be interested?

1024
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.950
You know?
You know,
I don't know.
It's like friends.

1025
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:34.770
I used to watch friends when I lived in New York City.
I was like,
God,

1026
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.830
look at that apartment,
which had a fucking huge apartment like that,

1027
01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.130
but I hated the fucking show.
So at the end of the day,
I didn't watch the show.

1028
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.760
How long can you look at the couch?
All right,
question number.
Hey,

1029
01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:49.530
this is the final question now bill,
why a while?
This is a cheesy question.

1030
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.800
I'm a chef,
so I always ask,
um,
and I,

1031
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:57.960
so I always ask and I think the answer says a lot.

1032
01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:02.620
What is your favorite food?
Slash?
Restaurant?
Ah,

1033
01:05:02.621 --> 01:05:04.790
what does my favorite food?
I like steak.
Um,

1034
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:10.350
and I really liked that steak and shake,
you know,
uh,
it's got two things.

1035
01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:15.060
I really enjoy.
Red Meat and a shakes.
No.

1036
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:18.010
Um,
I'm really,
I don't know.
I liked everything.
I would say Italian.

1037
01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:22.000
I think Italians make the best food hands down and uh,

1038
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.200
it's absolutely delish and um,
you know,

1039
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:28.180
the olive oil and just,
you know,

1040
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:30.520
you know what I love about Italians who really know how to cook.

1041
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:35.470
They know how to add stuff.
Like they don't like,

1042
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:40.000
I like explain it like whatever they add enhances the dish.

1043
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.640
It doesn't overpower it.
You know what I mean?

1044
01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:48.100
Like take like the art of making pizza somewhere along the line.

1045
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.400
The cheese on the pizza rather than enhancing the taste of the sauce.

1046
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:59.260
The cheese became the focal point.
Okay.

1047
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.660
I can't explain it.
Like it became the lead in the movie when it was actually,

1048
01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:08.170
you know the,
the the guy who had two lines in the movie,
it's like,
Oh look,

1049
01:06:08.171 --> 01:06:11.860
pizza hut.
They got it all over.
They got it in the cross.
They got it everywhere.

1050
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:15.950
You're just seen a big brick of cheese and it tastes like fucking shit and you

1051
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:19.240
can't move your bowels afterwards.
That I like Italian food.

1052
01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:22.480
I like the olive oil that they cook with.
I just,
you know,
it's very clean.

1053
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.190
You know,
you drink that,
you know,
it's sip a wine.
As long as you don't eat like,

1054
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:29.590
like you're going to the fucking all of garden.
You just feel great.

1055
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.540
You take your time.
It's a whole thing.

1056
01:06:32.350 --> 01:06:36.940
That's what I like about Italian food and restaurants,
like the whole thing,

1057
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:41.680
the lighting,
the ambiance,
everything.
Um,
so anyways,

1058
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:46.750
with that,
my uh,
my favorite restaurant when I was in New York was a,

1059
01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:50.260
I used to really,
I liked the lupa.
That was my favorite one,

1060
01:06:50.261 --> 01:06:54.340
the Mario Batali one and out here in la,
one of the best ones I went to,

1061
01:06:54.341 --> 01:06:58.330
I haven't been to a lot out here.
I went to a Mozart,
which is a,

1062
01:06:58.331 --> 01:07:01.060
another Mario Batali one,
but I'm,

1063
01:07:01.070 --> 01:07:03.530
I'm sort of like a hacky restaurant guy worth,

1064
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.570
they have a show on the food network.
I ended up going to it like,

1065
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:11.770
you know that you don't have blonde guy who wears the sunglasses backwards on

1066
01:07:11.771 --> 01:07:15.460
his head.
He's actually a favorite chef of Joe to Rosa's,

1067
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:17.470
I forget his fucking name,

1068
01:07:17.471 --> 01:07:19.930
but he just goes around the diners and that type of shit.

1069
01:07:19.931 --> 01:07:24.931
And I hated his restaurant in Sacramento and it was one of the worst fucking

1070
01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:29.950
things I ever went to.
He actually had,
I think I talked about it,
he had,

1071
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:35.110
he had the Sushi roll that had pork and French fries in it with some sort of

1072
01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:39.280
barbecue sauce and it wasn't rice.
I don't know what it was.

1073
01:07:39.281 --> 01:07:40.690
It was some sort of pasty thing.

1074
01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:44.860
It was absolutely fucking disgusting and it's in Sacramento,
don't go to it.

1075
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:49.610
And uh,
they go,
that's the end of the fucking podcast questions.
Um,

1076
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.320
um,
I think that's it.
I think that's it for the week.
Also,

1077
01:07:53.321 --> 01:07:56.440
I trashed best buy last week said I wasn't going to go there anymore because

1078
01:07:56.441 --> 01:07:59.470
they had that 15% restocking fee.

1079
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.450
Somebody sent me an email about that,

1080
01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:04.360
that if you buy something there and you don't like it and you bring it back,

1081
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:09.100
they still charge you 15% of it to just stick it back on the shelf.

1082
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:14.080
So some best buy person wrote,
why work at best buy and trust me,
it's necessary.

1083
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.840
They do it mainly on computers because when we sell one,

1084
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.310
we only make about 20 bucks in profit.
Really?

1085
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.580
Is that how you keep that big store open?

1086
01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:28.370
You make $20 on each laptop?

1087
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.630
I don't buy that and when someone decides to return it,

1088
01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:36.170
if we have to sell it for below cost,
no you don't.

1089
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.430
I've never gone into best buy and seen a TV or anything that says uh,

1090
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.210
everything there is full price.
What are you talking about?

1091
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.520
I don't know.
I'm going to give you the better for the dental.

1092
01:08:50.521 --> 01:08:53.480
I'm not going to give you the benefit of the doubt because best buy my Sanshou

1093
01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.220
Sir who wrote this fucking thing,

1094
01:08:55.221 --> 01:08:59.240
but you worked for an evil fucking place that put mom and pop fucking places out

1095
01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:02.870
of business.
Okay.
Back in the day when you return something,

1096
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:03.950
they just returned it.

1097
01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:06.800
They put it back in the fucking box and they stuck it on the shelf.

1098
01:09:06.801 --> 01:09:09.170
They didn't charge a 15% okay.

1099
01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:12.350
That's one of those exploiting new revenue streams,

1100
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.910
new way to come up with extra money to fuck the customer.
I firmly believe that.

1101
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.520
I've been in best buy,
I've shopped in best buy,

1102
01:09:19.521 --> 01:09:23.870
I've never seen any use cds and he used computers.
Everything is brand new.

1103
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:26.960
Okay,
so maybe you got to clarify that.

1104
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:31.240
Is there some sort of off the rack best buy thing down the street?
Uh,

1105
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:35.020
best buy part too.
I have no idea.
But,
uh,

1106
01:09:35.021 --> 01:09:38.270
I'm still saying fuck best buy.
So why don't you write me a followup?
Okay.

1107
01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.710
I know it was a bit of a cunt there,

1108
01:09:39.711 --> 01:09:42.830
so explain it further because I don't get it.
So anyways,

1109
01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.270
that's the podcast for the week.

1110
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.420
Thanks to everybody who sent me in all the God damn questions.
