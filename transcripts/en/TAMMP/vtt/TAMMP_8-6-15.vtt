00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.800
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and it's the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:08.530
Monday morning podcast.
Just before Friday.

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.023
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.833
<v 1>it's going on.</v>

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.660
I'm going to get complaints from my neighbors cause I got the fucking door open.

6
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:20.750
I don't give a shit cause it's hot today.
Oh,
it's Aha.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.680
I'll tell you it's a hot one,
you know.
Um,
it's fucking hot as shit.

8
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:27.580
But I live in California and I'm not running the fucking AC.
I'm,

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.630
I'm doing my plot.
You know,
I'm doing my part for the fishy,

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.070
for the water that we steal or whatever.
Uh,
you know,

11
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.050
I'm fucking,
you know,
I'm doing what I can,
but saw it as a,

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.820
that that's all you can do.
It's all you can tell.
You know,

13
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:45.760
you just do what she can.
Okay.

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.570
Just hope that the people at the top that don't give a fuck about anybody but

15
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:55.330
themselves in their bulls.
We'll,
we'll maybe let something trickled down to you.

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.050
That's right to you will.
Um,
yeah,
I've been,
uh,

17
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.810
I'm trying to do my part,
you know,

18
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:05.630
I was really fucking into that shit for a while.
Then I just like,
you know what?

19
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.240
Nobody else gives a fuck.
I'm not trying.
And then,
then I've Kinda,

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.720
I fucking grown up and I got out of it.
I've sworn off bottled water.

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.220
I'm not doing any more.
I walk around like,
like a fucking adult toddler.

22
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.540
I got a giant fucking thermos and I fill that thing up before I leave.

23
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.660
And then I just go out and,
uh,
I'm going to take that thing on the road.
Me,

24
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.380
I'm going to sip from it though.
There's no way I'm going to sit,
you know,

25
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:30.320
drink from it when I'm on stage,
when I do my shows,

26
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.230
because it's got like this red dog dick tip,

27
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.300
not get heckled enough as it is,
but uh,
you know,

28
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:42.320
you see that shit enough bottled water is used every year and thrown out to go

29
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.380
around the whole fucking world or something.
I think that's just our country.

30
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:47.330
I don't know what this Hippie told me.

31
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.110
It wasn't even a hippy with something on the discovery channel.
And um,

32
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.950
so I'm trying not to do that and then I'm taking quicker showers,

33
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.560
basically hosed myself down like a dog.
And then I shut off the water than I did.

34
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.640
I sold myself up.
Relaxed ladies,
try it out.

35
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:06.590
Try to compose yourself here and then when I'm done doing that,

36
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:09.610
then I just rinse myself off and itself cause I'm sick of people.
Yeah,

37
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.960
<v 3>you'll actually,</v>

38
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.920
you take a bell could use Liz would are there any for you if you stay in it up,

39
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.760
<v 1>it's like,
dude,
a bath.</v>

40
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.310
You're laying in your own filth.
You know what I mean?
It's fucking gross.

41
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.330
Unless you're a hot broad,
but some fucking bubble shit going on.

42
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:32.190
You're in there reading your little fucking book about the prince that's going

43
00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:36.610
to touch the lady's clam after they kiss the horse with the frog there.
Right.

44
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.610
Then it's just gross.
You're just a,
you're a fucking animal.

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.430
<v 1>You know it's clean water until you get in it.
Then you're just sitting there.</v>

47
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.980
There's a lot of shit with that.
You know,
people watch,
you know,

48
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.620
wash your hands after you take it pissed.
It's like,

49
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.920
why don't you fucking wash your hands before you do it?
Okay.

50
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:56.800
You're not opening doors with your Dick,
are you?

51
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.230
Unless you like Lenny Kravitz,

52
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.100
you squatted down during your solo and your fucking Dick came out of fucking

53
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.020
awesome.
Is that big?

54
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:08.470
Shout out to Lenny Kravitz having a great fucking rock and roll moment.

55
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.130
He fucking was doing a show I think over in Sweden and he's wearing leather

56
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.030
pants cause he's a fucking rock star and he squats down during the solo in his

57
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.380
fucking Dick flopped out.

58
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.180
And according to my wife who told me,
right,
I don't give a fuck.

59
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.200
I go fuck up.
My wife looks at Lenny's Dick.
Why wouldn't you if you're abroad,

60
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.470
why wouldn't ya?
Um,
you know,

61
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:40.390
a fucking a one of those fucking pop stars.
Clams came out.
You'd think,

62
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.590
I'm not looking.
Remember when Beyonce fell down the stairs,

63
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.870
you remember that you were waiting for a teddy that come out.

64
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.860
You weren't concerned about whether she got concussed.
Where are you?

65
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.490
You were waiting for an iconic teddy to flop out.

66
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.700
It has not happened as far as I know,
since Janet Jackson,

67
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.220
there was all that skanky wardrobe malfunction and that it was like,

68
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.240
you forgot that you weren't wearing panties and fucking Brittany would get out

69
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.270
and show her fucking clam.
You know what I mean?

70
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:13.960
That Tallahassee fucking Twat that she has.
I mean,
that's not sexy.

71
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.550
She's one of those dirty feet chicks.

72
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.780
He's one of those chicks walking in the fucking liquor store without fucking

73
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:23.530
sandals on.
And that's a mother too.
And I know I'm being harsh.

74
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.490
I know I'm judging her,
but you know,
ladies,
if you,

75
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.560
if you have filthy feet,
got dirty feet,

76
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:33.430
let's try to keep the titties and the sports bra this summer.
All right?
However,

77
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.000
if you clean,
you know,
and you roll down a flight of stairs,
by all means,
let it,

78
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.590
let them come up.
You know,
give somebody a show.

79
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.940
That's all I'm saying.
You know,
I'm trying to bring people together here.

80
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.043
So anyways,

81
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.100
his fucking Dick flopped out in the middle of his fucking solo in front of a

82
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:51.851
crowd of people.

83
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:56.440
He's Planning Guitar Solo as a rock star wearing leather pants.

84
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.440
And his dick flops out.
I mean,
come on.
How do you,

85
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:04.330
how does it get better than that?
As a man?
How can you be crushing it any harder?

86
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.920
I'll tell you are how you actually have a fucking you dick pierced.

87
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.760
You know what I mean?
That makes it even better.
Which evidently he did.

88
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:17.761
This guy's Dick was actually weighted down and it still flopped up number on

89
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.660
last Monday when I was talking about how dicks around in the fucking locker room

90
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:25.060
while they're out at a Lenny Kravitz concept too.

91
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.360
So if he easily offended,

92
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.620
if you don't got the quick twitch and you can't move your head out of the way

93
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.220
quickly,
you might not want to go for those front row seats.
You know?

94
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.560
I don't know what I'm talking about.
I don't talking about,

95
00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:41.500
I'm talking about Lenny's Dick coming out good for him.

96
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.710
And you know when anybody's offended by that fuck that they took 20 years for

97
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.860
that guy.
He's been around since 1988 what am I talking about?

98
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.430
This guy's been around for 27 years without incident,

99
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.470
I think once every three decades.
If you,
Dick Flops out during the performance,

100
00:05:56.471 --> 00:06:01.020
what do you,
what are you going to do?
It's bound to happen,
right?

101
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.810
You know,
somebody is going to,
oh,
I have what it happened over in Europe.

102
00:06:06.811 --> 00:06:10.200
They don't give a shit,
right.
Probably happens to them all the time.

103
00:06:10.201 --> 00:06:12.180
That fucking James is so tight over there.

104
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.830
All those tight as Jane's wherein fucking people over there in Europe.

105
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.150
I don't know what the deal is.
I think after World War Two,

106
00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:23.470
if your pants were too saggy,

107
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:27.820
someone would come by and just snatch them like a pair of warmup.
Fucking sweaty.

108
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.920
You know,
those guys were in the NBA,
right?
Some tearaways.

109
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.050
So the people over there in Europe,
you know,

110
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.740
their grandparents came back and they had to wear a tidy fucking jeans

111
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.520
and then their kids did it.

112
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:44.790
And now that kids kids do it and they're just walking around with those tight

113
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:49.690
fucking jeans
all up on the nuts.
Um,

114
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.800
I know what I'm talking about.
I actually got the fucking,
um,

115
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.580
so I got the door open here.
I've got a screen door for my,
from my office here.

116
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.650
Um,
underrated the fucking screen door.
It's a Goddamn game changer,
you know,

117
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.240
tell us a very white trash,
which is what I am,
you know,
white trash.

118
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.000
I'm a trashy sort of individual.
Um,
uh,
just killing it right now.

119
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:13.301
But,
uh,

120
00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:18.160
I just got to watch about this Dick Carson really loud because of my fucking

121
00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:20.850
neighbors.
What are they going to do?

122
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.030
It's a great thing about order order and a house owning a house.
It's like,

123
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:26.950
what are you going to,
I own the house.
What are you gonna do?

124
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.030
You're going to call the landlord.
That's me.
All right.

125
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.070
I know what some of you guys are saying.
Oh No,

126
00:07:33.071 --> 00:07:36.270
the bank is because you still owe them money.
No,
I don't.
Yeah.
Cons.

127
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.000
I fucking pay this thing off.
I own it.

128
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.340
This is my fucking hunk of shit.

129
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.320
Gradually fixing this fucking God damn house,
man.

130
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.500
I swear to God,
it's,
it's,
it's haunted with repairs every fucking time.
I think.

131
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:56.410
I think I'm,
I'm turning the corner.
You know,

132
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.860
I'm getting around the corner and something good's going to happen.

133
00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:03.310
Something else fucking happens in,
uh,
AH,
Christ.

134
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:07.120
I got fucking termites in my garage.
I got this other fucking,

135
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.120
I didn't want to talk about it,
you know,
but I got a screen door.
Okay.

136
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:13.540
Last month I did not have a screen door.
I'm not going negative here.

137
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.020
I'm going to stay positive.
So anyways,
I uh,

138
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.530
<v 0>yeah.</v>

139
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.970
<v 1>Uh,

You know,

142
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.830
We finished it and we had to do a couple of other things.

Oh,

166
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:05.550
we got to talk about the Tom Brady emails.

167
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.510
Did you guys read the fucking Tom Brady emails?
Did you,

168
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.220
did you sit down,
you know,
put on a nice comfortable sweater.

169
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.450
You know when that fits halfway over your hands and you picked up your coffee

170
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:23.200
mug with both fucking hands and just settle down to read the gossip?
Yeah.

171
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.560
<v 1>Well,
if you did,</v>

172
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.770
you've lost all respect with me and tell your father that he didn't raise a man.

173
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.770
I didn't read a model.

174
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.510
What kind of a fucking mad sits down and reads leaked emails of another man.

175
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.373
What are you doing?

176
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.213
<v 0>Huh?</v>

177
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.210
<v 1>Wait.
What?
What the how fucking pathetic is your God damn life.</v>

178
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.380
How jealous are you a Tom Brady that you're going to get in there and see him

179
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:54.490
talking,
talking to GSL about the fucking dog food he's got to go get.

180
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.620
You know what I mean?
Grow the fuck up.

181
00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:58.150
What'd you want somebody doing that to you?

182
00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.400
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.480
<v 1>Unbelievable.
How the fuck did he get air pressure?
Now we're reading his emails.</v>

184
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.260
What are we going to do next?
Give out the guy's social security number.

185
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.490
I can't wait for this whole fucking thing to turn around.
All right,

186
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:15.510
this guy's getting burned at the fucking steak and eventually there's going to

187
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:19.500
be nothing left to burn and then the media is slowly going to come around like,

188
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:23.760
Whoa,
we're referring to Tom Brady.
Skip Bayless is already doing it.

189
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:24.690
Skip Bayless,

190
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.890
who's never made a good point in his life somehow was on ESPN.

191
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.080
Skip Bayless,

192
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.650
who literally does is show where if one guy says you need air to breathe,

193
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.950
he will argue the other side just to keep some sort of,

194
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.360
just to keep the plates spinning,
just to keep the excitement going.

195
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.400
Skip Bayless,

196
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.170
how that guy is in hosting the family feud or,
or wheel of fortune.

197
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

198
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.420
<v 1>You know why that one where you punched the thing when it pops up,</v>

199
00:11:54.421 --> 00:11:57.870
whatever the card sharks as what he looks like he should be doing.

200
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.080
Even he knows even he knows that there's something rotten out there in

201
00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:07.950
Indianapolis.
There's something going on there in Baltimore too.

202
00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:12.040
Horrific fucking cities.
Absolutely horrific cities.

203
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.100
Baltimore,
you know your city's fucked up when they make the wire there.
Right?

204
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.030
That's a done deal.
I don't even need to talk any more about that city.

205
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.463
You know what I mean?

206
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.010
And then out in Indianapolis or what do they have in Indianapolis?

207
00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:30.090
They got the apple is 500 and a giant Klan rally every year.

208
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.010
You know
Jesus Christ.
You want to read some interesting,

209
00:12:35.011 --> 00:12:36.960
why don't you read about somebody who plays for the Pacers.

210
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:41.810
<v 0>Okay?</v>

211
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.770
<v 1>You're dead center in one of the widest fucking states ever with one of the</v>

212
00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:49.010
highest clan fucking memberships.
Dude,
Indiana.

213
00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:50.900
That is a place as a fucking white guy,

214
00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:55.790
if you want to be a complete fucking maniac and not be held accountable,

215
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.510
that's what I've learned.
Gemara say,
my hat is off to you.

216
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.340
My hat is off to you.
You pick the city,
man,
he picked this fucking state.

217
00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:07.910
They would.
If you're going to conduct yourself the way you conduct yourself,

218
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.650
okay?
And I tell you right now,

219
00:13:09.651 --> 00:13:12.230
I know you got a walk in closet bigger than my house,
full.

220
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.070
All kinds of habit dash Regan shiny fucking shoes and pocket squares.

221
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.120
But you're not fooling this balding redhead.
Oh No,
you are not,
sir.

222
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:25.310
I know who you are.
You know,
why?
Cause I used to drink and Chelsea,

223
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:27.440
Massachusetts,
I met guys like you.

224
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.860
Oh,
gives a fuck.
Football season is upon us.
It's August.

225
00:13:34.861 --> 00:13:39.480
Everybody Bump Toto Bodo put it up,
put in a battery,

226
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.900
<v 0>suck my fucking Dick.</v>

227
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.870
<v 1>It's here.
It's beginning.</v>

228
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.050
And God bless all those football fans that are such maniacs,

229
00:13:51.051 --> 00:13:55.340
like especially Steeler fans who are out there fucking at the Steelers training

230
00:13:55.341 --> 00:14:00.140
camp bugging,
you know Randy Bauman,
you know,

231
00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:04.970
on Wd v e and Pittsburgh.
All right.
Oh by the way,
by the way,

232
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.180
Pittsburgh people you might want to watch after his for family,

233
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.170
you might want to watch F is for family.
You might recognize something.

234
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.460
There's a little teaser.
You might recognize something on that show.

235
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.760
I gave a little nod to fucking steel town there,

236
00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:23.860
which has now become computer town down there at the stacks.

237
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.780
Let's go down at forever 21.
Um,
anyways,

238
00:14:29.781 --> 00:14:33.110
what am I talking about here?
Yeah,
so football season's coming up.
Um,

239
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:39.190
I actually went to a party recently and it was this couple that Nia and I know

240
00:14:39.891 --> 00:14:42.830
and they're a,
they're moving back to New York.
You know,
they,
uh,

241
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.860
one of them got this awesome acting gig and all that.
Just fuck it.
Oh,
by the way.

242
00:14:45.861 --> 00:14:49.610
And they got the cutest fucking kid ever,
right?
Little redheaded boy.

243
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.390
And His dad is a drummer and his mother is a singer.
So he's got,
you know,

244
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.010
he's got the gift and he fucking loves drums,
right?

245
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:00.020
So he's fucking Waylon on these drums.

246
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:04.730
He's like two years old Whalen on these drums.
And uh,
I don't,

247
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.810
I don't know what the next thing,
you know,

248
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:10.190
I'm fucking sitting there with my iPhone and I'm showing him Moby Dick,

249
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.821
the fucking a,

250
00:15:11.821 --> 00:15:14.540
that didn't sound good at toddler and then Dick in the same sentence.
No,

251
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:19.310
it didn't.
The song,
a led Zeppelin Song,

252
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:23.360
the Moby Dick,
the drum solo,
and uh,
the one for Royal Albert Hall,

253
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.970
when he's on that maple kit and I showed on,

254
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.980
the first thing I did was I showed him the clip of Keith Carlock that my wife

255
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:35.330
took when we saw steely Dan and he kept going,
play it again,

256
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.650
play it again,
play it again.

257
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.030
And then when Keith would be going completely nuts on the drums,
you know,

258
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:43.220
like the third time he just looked two years old,

259
00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:46.310
just looked up to me and he just goes,
wow.

260
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.110
Where you would say,
wow,
you know,
the whole thing was great.

261
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:54.530
But when he built it up to like the,
the,
the peak,
this kid was going nuts.

262
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.820
So my guy you liked and we watched it like eight times in a row,

263
00:15:57.821 --> 00:15:59.270
he kept going play it again,
play it again.

264
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.760
Riveted like most kids is sitting there watching uh,

265
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:05.270
the tumbleweeds or whatever the cuff fuck you call those things.

266
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.600
All those things that didn't talk and everybody thought it made your kid weird.

267
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.540
There was a blue one and a red one,
not the M and.
M's,

268
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.300
they look like a Barbara Papa's,

269
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.110
but they were more like robotic teletubbies.
Yeah.
We got like,

270
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.570
I worked it out teletubbies.
So anyways,
uh,

271
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.460
he's fucking riveted to that.
So I go,

272
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.520
I'm going to show you this John Barnum thing.
And uh,

273
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.140
he just fucking got just totally enamored with it.

274
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.420
Um,
it was fucking awesome.
It was awesome.
Cause I know that kid,

275
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:41.570
that kid's going to be a great drummer.
So,
uh,
actually before they leave,

276
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:44.180
I'm going to try to find,
you can find it anymore.
They don't even make DVDs.

277
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:49.010
I got to get them a DVD copy of that so they can pop that in.
You know,

278
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.560
how cool is it to have a kid like that?
That's babysitting.

279
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.700
You fucking put in led Zeppelin and the kids loving it at two years old as

280
00:16:55.701 --> 00:16:59.120
opposed to some fucking kitty shit that's just playing one of those songs that

281
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:01.340
slowly drives you mad.
Right?

282
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.050
This is the song that does and that's why you got to get them into sesame

283
00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:10.400
street.
Right?
Sesame street has all one,
all that fucking subtle humor for adults.

284
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.420
They actually realized that there was going to be a parent around,

285
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:18.710
but somewhere along the line that fucking art has really dropped off.

286
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:20.030
They do it with movies though,

287
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.370
one of those toy story movies and that type of ship.

288
00:17:23.371 --> 00:17:27.080
But when they just make something just straight up for kids,
um,

289
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:32.470
like literally the drugs you have to do to be on to somehow fucking get through

290
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:36.830
it and knowing full well the kid wants to,
you know,
you can get through it once,

291
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:41.180
but knowing that the kid wants to see it again,
I mean,
Jesus Christ.
Oh Jesus.

292
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:45.710
All right,
let's do a,
let's do a little bit of advertising here for this week.
Uh,

293
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.730

It's weird.
It's weird.
It's almost a,

294
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.770
it was like,
I need to read these a little straighter.

295
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.270

298
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:06.114

299
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.620

332
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.130
this is the way to do it.
Come home.
You throw the shit in the pot,
it's done.

333
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:10.890
You eat it.
Stare at the TV,
you're not off,

334
00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:12.450
and you go right back to work the next day.

335
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.690
Next thing you know the hot broad down the hall,
you want a bank.
So I said,

336
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:19.980
what are you doing?
It's something that the shame of your mother's desk.
No Bitch,

337
00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.990
I got it
right and shelter,
you get apps too.

338
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.400
They'll take the elevator right down to the fucking,
what do you call it?

339
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:30.930
The fucking you collected there.

340
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.200
We'll start at the start at the top floor.

341
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.050
If you want to get more blow jobs guys,
I'm telling you,

342
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:43.320
you got to get abs because what happens is they'll kiss on those two,

343
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:46.260
which is the two easiest ones to get.
But then if it starts smoothing out,

344
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:49.640
they can't get up that hill.
They can't get over the hill.
He his stomach,

345
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:53.960
he got to flatten that fucker up,
you know?
Then they go down and flow number two,

346
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:57.020
floor number three and then they spend the night and those,
those two long ones,

347
00:20:57.021 --> 00:21:01.760
that's like the slide,
you know
right into the power switch.

348
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.530
Ah,
God pill really has it come to that?

349
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.720
What it is it come to that.
It's always been there.

350
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.530
I've always been a dick joke comic.
All right.
So speaking of that,

351
00:21:12.531 --> 00:21:14.810
how you guys doing on your diet?
How are you guys doing?

352
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.110
Get Your beach body by September.
Just like me with global warming,

353
00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.990
you can walk around shirtless until October.
It's phenomenal.

354
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.680
Walk around shirtless,
you know,
go up and hug a walrus.

355
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.160
That for some reason is in your backyard.
Now who knows?
Why is it there?

356
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.263
I don't know.

357
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:34.520
Did you check out the new iPhone seven [inaudible] I should talk.
I get to six.

358
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.640
Um,
anyways,
so,
uh,

359
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:42.650
this week I need to get down to a buck 74.
As of this morning,
I was one 75.2,

360
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.670
but having a rough week,
you know,
I even played hockey this weekend.
I'm still,

361
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.930
I'm thinking I'm starting.

362
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.260
My Body's getting used to not Busan and me eating well,

363
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.380
which is scary because that means if I stopped doing this and I go back to the

364
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:58.940
toxic,
Shit's going to be a problem.
Like the other night,
uh,
a buddy of mine,

365
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.990
um,
he,
he was every Tuesday night,
right?

366
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.680
He makes some food and he's got this,
uh,
you know,

367
00:22:06.681 --> 00:22:10.050
he makes the move and pictures there.
He makes the talkies.
So he,

368
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.390
he has like his son comes over and uh,
you know,
when he shows,
you know,

369
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.410
a bunch of his friends,

370
00:22:15.411 --> 00:22:18.620
I come over a couple of other people and they fucking screen movies or whatever.

371
00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:21.500
So I went over there and he had burgers and fries and I'm going,
Oh shit,

372
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.980
I didn't eat dinner.
And I was like fuck it.
So I grabbed the Turkey Burger,

373
00:22:24.981 --> 00:22:28.130
I had French fries and onion rings.
Not too many,

374
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:31.460
but I had him and then I was thinking,
well I'm playing hockey later,

375
00:22:31.461 --> 00:22:32.810
I'll fucking burn this off.

376
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.230
And all I did was I went out and hockey and I literally felt like I ate one of

377
00:22:36.231 --> 00:22:41.231
my skates and we played at this new fucking place that has was the rink was the

378
00:22:42.531 --> 00:22:47.330
size of like Olympic level ice like the European iceman.
I fucking loved it.

379
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.560
I loved it cause I was actually able to stick handle for a good second and a

380
00:22:51.561 --> 00:22:54.350
half before somebody took it away from me.
Cause those smaller rinks,

381
00:22:54.351 --> 00:22:58.250
people are just on top of you.
So I liked it and,
and everybody else was like,

382
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:02.460
oh my good.
It was so fucking tired.
It's like really I wasn't,
you know,

383
00:23:02.461 --> 00:23:05.370
some about not handling the puck and just gliding around,
you know,

384
00:23:05.371 --> 00:23:09.330
you really keep your wind.
Um,
I was bad.

385
00:23:09.331 --> 00:23:14.070
I went out my first shift,
they went out and I fucking skated at my,
my own guy,

386
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.560
you know,
made a move right over the blue line.

387
00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:19.710
And I just looked at him as he came right at me and he was looking down at the

388
00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:24.030
puck and we fucking slammed into each other like a couple of toddlers.
Um,

389
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.590
and of course everyone's like,
hey,
you know,

390
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.570
just embarrassing myself but I'm,
I'm on,

391
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.550
I'm not out there to get better at hockey.
Who's kidding?
Who?

392
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:37.120
I'm out there like a total la fucking plastic phony.

393
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:41.440
I'm out there to burn calories.
So anyways,
I'm one 75.2,

394
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.350
so I'm going to hit it hard the next couple of days,

395
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:48.950
get myself down one 74 and then Dan,
it gets exciting.

396
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.180
Then it gets excited cause my fight and weights about one 71,
one 72,

397
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:56.270
although there's pooch,
you know,
I'm trying to up the fucking protein,

398
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.220
you know what I mean?
Um,

399
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.680
and I've been doing this workout that Burt fucking cry.

400
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:08.060
Bert Kreischer tweeted to me,
um,
I think it was from men's health magazine.

401
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:10.820
It was like improving your grip strength and I'm telling you dude,

402
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.340
I've done a lot of different shit and it's like,
yeah,
whatever,

403
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:16.780
whatever this shit fucking works.
Um,
I'm going to,
uh,

404
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.540
I'm going to read we it retweeted or whatever.
Um,

405
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.970
basically to improve your grip strength,
which helps you,

406
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:27.530
I guess lift heavier shit.
I don't know what,

407
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:30.110
I'm just trying to be able to do more pull ups,
this fucking thing.

408
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:33.920
It's really cool.
So the first thing you do is you hang from the Ia,

409
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:37.640
you hang from the,
your chin up bar in the pullup position.

410
00:24:37.641 --> 00:24:41.210
You try to do it two sets for a minute straight,
whatever.

411
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:44.330
If you can only do 10 seconds next time,
try 15,
you work your way up.

412
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.640
So once you do that,
which I've been able to do,

413
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.750
then you do it where you hanging from for a minute,

414
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.400
one hand on the pull up bar,

415
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:56.780
the other one you hang a rag or a towel over the,
uh,

416
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.660
the chin up bar and then you help at one hand is holding the towel.

417
00:24:59.661 --> 00:25:03.650
The other one's holding the,
uh,
the pull up bar.
So most of your,

418
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.880
most of your,
um,
strength is coming from the thing.

419
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.620
Obviously the hand holding the uh,

420
00:25:09.621 --> 00:25:14.621
the pull up bar and you get to the point where you can do that for a minute with

421
00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:18.440
each hand.
Right?
So I got to that point.
So now I'm to the next one.
This one,

422
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:23.441
now you just hang from the fucking pull up bar by one arm for a minute and I'll

423
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:26.780
see how that goes.
Hopefully I don't pull my arm out on my socket,

424
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:30.040
but I've noticed that,
you know,
climbing the rope,
the peg board,

425
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.070
all of that type of shit is getting a,
it's getting easier.
Also,
you know,

426
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.910
I'm shaving down the fucking ham,
so,
uh,
I dunno.

427
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.710
That's what the fuck I've been doing oatmeal every fucking day,
guys,
oatmeal,

428
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:43.544
banana,

429
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.760
and I'm doing a little bit less oatmeal and I'm scrambling to fucking eggs with

430
00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:49.340
nothing on them for the protein or whatever.

431
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:51.980
And I got to tell you is bland as that is when I'm done eating it,

432
00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:53.990
I feel like I could run through a fucking wall though.

433
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.300
My wife's been doing this thing where she makes oatmeal,

434
00:25:56.301 --> 00:25:58.850
then she puts some peanut butter in there and then some berries.

435
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:04.400
And I'm telling you,
dude,
you fucking eat like that.
You feel like a superhero.

436
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.760
And then of course you go to pick up a box if you my age than you,
you know,

437
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.970
you feel like it's 600 years old,
but when you walk over to the box,

438
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:16.220
you feel phenomenal.
Um,
so anyways,
oh,
so as I was mentioned,

439
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:20.110
so I went to that party,
right.
I'm all over the map has always,
um,

440
00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:22.160
with the couple that was,
you know,

441
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:26.300
is moving away with the fucking soon to be rock stars Sun,
right?

442
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.080
Um,
anyways,
uh,

443
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:35.750
I met somebody over there that was a big time Auburn Fan.
And,

444
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:38.800
uh,
he was just going off talking about,
you know,

445
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.250
are they really got a shot this year,
you know,

446
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:42.500
being good and all that type of shit.
And uh,

447
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.010
he me where there was an Auburn bar and um,
I dunno man,

448
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:50.640
I know I'm an Lsu guy,
but I think Auburn's my second team in the SCC,

449
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.730
I just like both those teams because they have a huge rivalry with Alabama.

450
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:57.060
I know everybody in the SCC AIDS Alabama.
I didn't even hate Alabama.
They just,

451
00:26:57.061 --> 00:27:00.890
just fun to root against them.
My,
come on man,
I'm a fucking,
uh,

452
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.970
what do you call it?
A carpet bagger or whatever.

453
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.360
I'm not from the south would have fucked do I get off picking a team?
Right.

454
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.250
If I was like a,
a typical Yankee Fan,
I go down there and I'd be like,

455
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.110
oh look it a little bit about,
you know,
cause they don't like a challenge,

456
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.630
you know what I mean?
A mets fan,
right?
Mets fan would come down,
they'd be like,

457
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:21.720
Fuck Alabama.
Um,
so what,
I'm a red sox fan,

458
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:26.520
so I always fuck the people that are on top,
which is hilarious at this point.

459
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:29.020
The amount of money that was a red sox fan,
a red sox spent.

460
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.150
I know I'm a total hypocrite,

461
00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:34.440
but it's just fun to root against Alabama because Alabama is supposed to win.

462
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.460
So let's gets boring after awhile.
Um,

463
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.870
although I am psyched that um,
that saving was able to,
uh,

464
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.110
bring the program back cause it was once bear Bryant went away.

465
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:49.290
That was a rough number of years.
You know,
it's funny.

466
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:52.140
Do you know how I always remember Nick Saban's name?
Cause I always forget it.

467
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.880
I always remember when I was at the Lsu game and the whole student section,

468
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.790
they would chant,
fuck you say then fuck you Saban and I,

469
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.590
for some reason that just stuck with me.
So whenever I'm,

470
00:28:05.591 --> 00:28:06.840
I'm coming up to his name,

471
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.800
I start slowing down the sentence and then I hear that students section chanting

472
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:13.740
that,
how fucking weird is that?
Well,
whatever,
I'm a weird guy.

473
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.270
What do you want from me?
Um,
all right,
so we're coming up on 28 minutes here.

474
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.230
I'm finally getting my Internet fixed today,
man.
Um,

475
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.460
I went on this website that somebody told me about to see what,

476
00:28:25.461 --> 00:28:26.400
what I was getting.

477
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.940
If you get in like 40 to 60 megabytes per minute download,

478
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:35.850
like that's like the bare minimum,
I guess even that kind of sucks.

479
00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:41.370
I don't know shit about this.
I was getting 0.3.
I haven't had like dial up.

480
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.720
I just had regular old fucking Internet.
I didn't realize it.

481
00:28:45.721 --> 00:28:47.910
So uploading these podcasts has been taken forever.

482
00:28:47.911 --> 00:28:52.860
So now I said fuck this and um,
I just got the,

483
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:54.480
I went to a different company.

484
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:58.010
Now I'm going to get 300 megabytes of fucking minute.
I want to like that,

485
00:28:58.011 --> 00:29:01.140
that fucking Internet you get at the hotel.
Whenever I record one at the hotel,

486
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:05.610
I go to upload it and just goes fucking way done.
My heart.
What does it do,

487
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:09.450
Bill fucking gun,
right?
I do it here.

488
00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:14.250
I'm sitting around for like four hours screaming at my computer.
Ooh,
fuck it.

489
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:18.510
Hey computers like a goddamn baby.
All right.
So anyways,
that is the,
uh,

490
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:21.540
the Thursday afternoon podcast.
Hope you guys having a good week.
If you're not,

491
00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.440
it's already Thursday.
You probably listened to this on the ride home.

492
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.220
You only got one more day.
Fuck it.
Right.
Have a good time this weekend.

493
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.710
Summer's almost over and joy it.
Have a good weekend.
You cunt.

494
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.630
And I will talk to you on Monday and Monday.
I have a,
uh,

495
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.940
I have a big announcement that I'm not going to be able to do on the podcast

496
00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:42.890
because I have to wait until nine o'clock at night,

497
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.370
I think east coast time,
which would be 6:00 PM my time.

498
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.810
If you follow me on Twitter,
I have a,
a huge gig coming up.

499
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.790
Um,
and tickets will be going on sale and uh,

500
00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.460
I gotta get my ass,
forget about physically in shape.

501
00:29:58.461 --> 00:30:02.030
I've got to get my ass in shape,
uh,
comedically for this,
for this,
uh,

502
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.750
for this Gig.
So whatever.
That's the,
uh,
that's the Thursday afternoon podcast.

503
00:30:05.751 --> 00:30:08.860
Just chicken in and you'd go fuck yourselves.
Nonaka fucking sets.
Thursday.

504
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.450
You have a nice weekend.
You cuts.
I'll talk to you later.

505
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:32.783
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

506
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:02.240
<v 1>Advice.
Spill.
How's it going?
I hope that wherever you're read,
everything</v>

507
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.520
<v 4>thing is going swell.
Lol.
All right.</v>

508
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.980
It's kind of a question about a relationship.
Here's my story.
I'm 19 years old,

509
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:15.170
19 year old female who's been dating a 2021 year old male and we've been

510
00:31:15.171 --> 00:31:17.420
together almost five years old,

511
00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:20.690
g five fucking years.

512
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:26.870
And she writes fucking ridiculous.
Uh,
fucking ridiculous.
I know.

513
00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:29.990
And our relationship has had its ups and downs,
like any relationship,

514
00:31:29.991 --> 00:31:34.790
but lately I feel like I can't stand them anymore.
Yeah,

515
00:31:34.791 --> 00:31:38.690
that's understandable.
You've been dating.
I'm like half of your fucking life.
Um,

516
00:31:38.691 --> 00:31:41.270
I don't know what's wrong with me or maybe it's him.

517
00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.050
I don't know what's going on.
I have no fucking clue.

518
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:50.000
But he seems to have a really big problem with wheat.
If he isn't high,

519
00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.110
he can't think about anything else but getting high.
Oh God.
Here we go.

520
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:58.580
His goal in life is to get high as a fucking kite and giggle.

521
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:03.800
That's a peaceful,
nice fucking goal.
Uh,
she writes,
what the fuck?

522
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.800
I don't want to be dating a weakling who needs a drug,

523
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.420
like who leads a drug like that.

524
00:32:08.421 --> 00:32:11.660
I want a man and I don't know how to tell him that.

525
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.130
Every time I tell him I have a problem,
uh,
with the weed,

526
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.730
we get into a huge argument and I ended up being the bitch.

527
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.630
I just want them to care about me more than he cares about his weed and it's

528
00:32:25.851 --> 00:32:27.020
hurting us financially.

529
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:33.010
We both only make 300 bucks a week and he's spending 75% of his check on weed,

530
00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:37.970
cigarettes and gas.
I am the breadwinner.
I don't want to be the breadwinner.

531
00:32:37.971 --> 00:32:41.650
I'm so tired of taking care of his dumb ass.
Um,

532
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.730
he doesn't even seem like he's willing to change even a little bit.
What do I do?

533
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.170
I know I probably sound like a complete prude,
but I'm not at all.
Well,
anyways,

534
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.860
uh,
I really hope you read this and can give me some good advice.
All right,

535
00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.580
ma'am,
you are dating a fucking loser.

536
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.300
Yeah.
You're dating a loser,
so yeah,
you gotta you gotta get out of it.
I mean,

537
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.490
the only red flag in there is when you said,

538
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:11.840
I just want him to care about me more than he cares about his weed.

539
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.220
Now
the only question I have there is,
well,

540
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:18.920
what if he was really into playing guitar?
Would you then be like,

541
00:33:18.921 --> 00:33:23.120
I just want him to care more about me that he does about his guitar playing?

542
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.730
Because then you know,

543
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.320
that's actually a red flag with you because you could be one of those awful

544
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:31.040
people,

545
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.920
like one of the worst relationships you can seriously be and is when you're

546
00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:36.780
dating somebody who,
uh,

547
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:42.010
find your passion to be a threat and then they systematically,

548
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.970
like they try to mind fuck you out of basically either your dream in life all

549
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:53.150
the way down to just a simple hobby that you have just because it steals focus

550
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.420
from you paying attention to them,
which I don't think you are in this.

551
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.230
I think you sound very rational.
You actually said,
I don't know if it's me,

552
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:04.970
so I don't think you are being like that.
So I have to side with you 100% here.

553
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.520
All right,
let's fill this,
first of all,

554
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:09.170
we'll start with your relationship and just,

555
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:14.030
just completely ignore the fact that he's 21 year,

556
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:17.450
19 you've been together for five years,
which means when you got together,

557
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.520
you were 14,
he was 16,

558
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.120
which means at some point he was 18 and you are under 18.

559
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.900
So there was some sort of statutory rape going on there,
right?

560
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:32.600
Uh,
we'll ignore all of that and just get to the fact like,
you know,

561
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.761
I've been,

562
00:34:34.761 --> 00:34:37.760
a lot of my listeners would probably think that I was going to trash you for you

563
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:41.600
saying that I,
I am the,
I'm the breadwinner.
I don't want to be the breadwinner,

564
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:46.760
you know,
and I,
and I would go out typical fucking broads,
you know,

565
00:34:46.761 --> 00:34:50.000
they all talk about how they want to be the independent God damn woman and Yada,

566
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:53.900
Yada,
Yada,
and all of a sudden they got to take care of some fucking sponge.

567
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.480
Welcome to my goddamn world.
I'm not,
I don't feel that's that,

568
00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:02.170
that you're like that.
I know what you see a date and a fucking loser.
You're,

569
00:35:02.171 --> 00:35:06.200
you're dating a future,
uh,
subject on cops.
It seems,

570
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.880
you know,
you,
the way you describe him,
it's his,
he shirtless to,

571
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.650
this guy's a fucking loser.
He makes 300 bucks a week.

572
00:35:15.651 --> 00:35:20.300
I'm not judging that aspect of it,
but he spends 75% of it on weed,

573
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.050
cigarettes and gas.
You know,

574
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.220
right now I'm picturing that guy that,
uh,

575
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.200
Matthew mcconaughey played in dazed and confused,

576
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:34.190
just hanging around the high school,
like where the party's at,
man,
you know,

577
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:38.640
with his cool car.
Um,
yeah.
Got To get out of the relationship,

578
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.790
you know,
and there's nothing wrong as a female if,
if,

579
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.550
you know,
I'm not saying that you go out and just be a fucking gold digger,

580
00:35:47.551 --> 00:35:51.150
but she wants you man to be able to provide.
That's what the fuck we do.

581
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.720
We provide,
we don't provide,
we're useless.

582
00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.420
We don't have a womb right now.
Seriously,
but fucking useless.

583
00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:05.400
So I,
uh,
I get it.
Yeah,
you got,
you got to break up with this guy.

584
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.790
You mean,
how many times can you already,

585
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:11.520
it seems like you're approaching this guy on egg shells.

586
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.190
You know how it'd be really nice if you,
you know,

587
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.570
she's just stop being a fucking loser.
You'd been,

588
00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.230
you're not even saying that you're being a nice person.

589
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:20.610
So if I had to give you any advice,

590
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.020
I would say you need to get out of that relationship and considering you've been

591
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:28.710
in it since you're 14,
I think a,

592
00:36:28.711 --> 00:36:33.570
you might be a little codependent and I think you need to to break up with this

593
00:36:33.571 --> 00:36:36.090
guy.
Figure out who the fuck you are,

594
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.040
which will involve you staying single for a significant period of time.

595
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:46.260
And uh,
it,
just know that you know,
breakups are painful.

596
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:51.950
Just prepare yourself for that so you don't go running back to this fucking

597
00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:56.100
loser and waste another five years of your fucking life.

598
00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.240
Cause you don't want to go through six weeks of pain.
Just,
you know,

599
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.630
as they said and platoon take the pain.
All right?

600
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:07.350
Just get out of the fucking relationship and just,
just tell yourself,

601
00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:10.530
this is going to suck for six weeks.
I'm going to wake up crying.

602
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.510
I'm going to feel lost.

603
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:17.460
I'm going to be wondering what did I used to do with all my free time before I

604
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:18.480
was with this person?

605
00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:23.481
You can have that bizarre feeling where now you're looking back on somebody who

606
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:27.140
was a huge party of life and now they're becoming a stranger.

607
00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:31.470
So then it just becomes this weird episode.
Like what was that?
Who was that?

608
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.640
What the fuck was that my life that just went into that fucking room for five

609
00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:39.720
years?
It's really buzz.
Just prepare yourself that that's going to happen,

610
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.870
but every day it gets a little bit fucking easier.

611
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.660
And then one day you're gonna wake up.
You're not going to give a shit.

612
00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:48.360
The Sun's going to be shining.
And uh,

613
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:51.570
and then just enjoy being single.

614
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:55.950
Your only fucking 19 years old is no fucking reason to be in a relationship

615
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:59.320
that's serious for that fucking long with the fucking loser.

616
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:04.290
So get out of it,
get through the pain.
And then after six weeks,

617
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:08.610
you know,
just hang out with your friends,
have a good fucking time,

618
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:09.990
but do not get into another relationship.

619
00:38:09.991 --> 00:38:12.480
I wouldn't get into another relationship for like a year,

620
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.780
just be single for at least a fucking year and feel how awesome that is to just

621
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:21.390
be single,
to wake up,
you know,

622
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.030
feel good about yourself,

623
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:27.990
but then not have to worry that someone else's a Douche.
So that drags down.

624
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:31.920
You're feeling good about yourself quotient and just fucking be single.

625
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.890
All right.
They go,
I said the same thing 90 times in a fucking roll.
I realize it.

626
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.500
And a what do we got a little over an hour ago?

627
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.130
<v 0>Yeah.
So good luck to your head.</v>

628
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:06.400
Sort

629
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.840
<v 4>of his bucket situation.
This guy got herself into,
um,
all right,</v>

630
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.080
well my girlfriend is 10 years older than me.
Oh Jesus.
She has two kids

631
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.880
and has been married and divorced twice.

632
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.150
Dude,
what the fuck?

633
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.440
I'm 26 j says Christ college graduate.

634
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.880
Has any of this made any sense to any of you?
Would anybody else be out there?

635
00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.010
26 college fucking graduate.

636
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.090
Have a girlfriend 10 years older than you with two kids who's been married and

637
00:39:41.091 --> 00:39:45.170
divorced twice.
Good God man.
He goes,

638
00:39:45.171 --> 00:39:47.450
I consider myself somewhat intelligent.

639
00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.710
I'm sure you are,
but not in this area.
Um,
by that I mean,

640
00:39:54.711 --> 00:39:57.710
you should have no problem understanding this email.
Well,
yeah,

641
00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.900
I know everybody trashes me.
I know,
I know.

642
00:39:59.901 --> 00:40:04.520
I'm the worst when it comes to reading this shit.
So anyways,
here we go.
He says,

643
00:40:04.521 --> 00:40:09.521
four weeks ago I found text messages to some dude on my girlfriend's phone that

644
00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:15.971
although innocent enough made it clear that whoever she was texting was on more

645
00:40:16.401 --> 00:40:20.330
familiar grounds than just some work colleague or a friend,

646
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.980
Jesus Christ.
Dude,
is that going to be a happy ending here?

647
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.280
I confronted her about it and it predictably led to a lot of finger pointing.

648
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.630
We went back and forth and uh,
and uh,

649
00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:37.550
for a few days and aired out our grievances,
but it seemed agreeable.

650
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:42.560
Now he bakes,
I guess point number two,
two oh two more weeks passed by.

651
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.060
And Lo and behold,

652
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.070
I find more text messages from the same fucking guy.

653
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.100
At first I tell myself,
okay,

654
00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.950
maybe she can't break things off with this dude so quickly,
Jesus Christ,
who,

655
00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:00.170
you know,
sometimes liberal thought is a,
is a great thing.
Like,

656
00:41:00.171 --> 00:41:04.640
let's have a fair fucking trial for somebody before we hang them from the

657
00:41:04.641 --> 00:41:07.670
nearest tree.
But then there's times it's fucking stupid.

658
00:41:07.671 --> 00:41:11.240
This is just liberal thought to the,
I mean,

659
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:15.500
how much of a benefit of the doubt can you give somebody,
you know?
So he goes,

660
00:41:15.501 --> 00:41:19.310
so I confront her about it and this leads to another round of finger pointing.

661
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.630
At which point she tells me to pack my shit and leave.

662
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.380
I'll do it.
I'm going to tell you right now before I read the rest of it.

663
00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:31.070
That's fucking great.
You didn't have to do any dirty work.
You're out.

664
00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.400
You're fucking up.
So anyways,
he goes,

665
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:38.870
were separated for a week when she asked me to come back and move in.
Dude,

666
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:44.330
this chick is a fucking psycho.
Here we go.
We talk about our future together,

667
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.340
how,
sorry she is to have done that to me,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

668
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:50.510
For Fuck Sakes.

669
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:54.350
We even talking about getting married when things finally fucking evened out.

670
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.380
I was full of piss and vinegar and felt vindicated,

671
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:02.060
vindicated that I was the one wronged in the whole situation and she was

672
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:07.061
actually making good by taking responsibility for what she had done through

673
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:10.360
taking responsibility would have been fucking after.

674
00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.720
Do the second you see those weird texts?
Just get,
I'm telling you right now,

675
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:17.990
just get out of the relationship.
There isn't,
oh sorry.

676
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.210
Sorry about that.
Didn't know that.
That's it.
It's over.
It's fucking over.

677
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.790
Um,
but whatever.
You're 26 I guess you still haven't learned.

678
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:31.550
I was dumb in my 20 self.
Here we go.

679
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:35.960
Let's read the rest of this all was well and good until she didn't come home

680
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:37.970
this Thursday night,
November 11th.

681
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.410
She came in Friday morning with no explanation,
no apology,
no nothing.

682
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.140
She asked me to give her some more time,

683
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:48.800
but I decided to cut bait and just get the fuck out of this situation.

684
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.070
Hang on a second everybody.
Sorry.

685
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.420
I had to give him a little applause break there.

686
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:58.310
Of course now I'm wracked with guilt of leaving the woman I loved and lived with

687
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:02.390
for the past five fucking year.
You got what?
They're,
when you were 21,
dude,

688
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.250
she was 31.
Wait,
let's do the math.
She was 31.
You were 21.

689
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.830
She was already married twice.
All right.

690
00:43:09.831 --> 00:43:11.870
This chick's is psycho and you know what that means?

691
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:14.510
She's fucking great and bed you at 21.

692
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.920
She fucking devastated you with fucking her pussy,
right?

693
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:23.270
Best blowjob.
You have a had.
Isn't that what happened?
And next thing you know,

694
00:43:23.271 --> 00:43:27.560
you have to fucking too young and dumb me to give you fell for

695
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.170
Jesus Christ.
He stayed there for five fucking years.
So anyway,

696
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:34.640
I guess just Schick still calling him.

697
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:36.710
Tell him she still wants to get back together.

698
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.970
I feel like every time I sat up and do what I think is best for me,

699
00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:45.290
she wants me back.
And every time what I do,
what's best for us as a couple,

700
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:49.730
she uses that as an opportunity to fuck with me all over again.
Yes.
Yes,

701
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.320
you're absolutely right.
Listen to your gut.
This guy,
see,

702
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.770
he knows the fucking answers.
He's,
he's listening to his gut.
Good fucking man.

703
00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.600
Um,
is this,

704
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.040
is it just that chicks can handle a guy that is emotionally invested or do I

705
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:12.041
just happen to be dealing with one of those sociopath's that doesn't give a fuck

706
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.860
what she does so long as it suits her in the moment.
Yes.

707
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.860
This plenty of fucking good women.
It was not plenty of good ones.

708
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:21.380
There's good women out there.
All right.
Just like good.

709
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.280
A good man's hard to find this.
Finding a good woman's also difficult.
All right.

710
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:29.420
But no,
you happen to be dealing with an absolute fucking sociopath.
All right.

711
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.670
She had a fucked up childhood happened to her.
She got touched.

712
00:44:32.671 --> 00:44:35.910
Her fucking dad took off.
I don't know.
Or She just got the fucking,

713
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.940
she got one of those bad brains,
you know.
Ivy,

714
00:44:39.941 --> 00:44:42.300
can you tell you guys my theory on that?
The a brain,

715
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:46.890
the bee brain and the sea brain,
the brain is the genius to be brain is the uh,

716
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.290
oh,
he's a good fucking shit.
You know?

717
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.800
Fitzy and then the sea brain is your fucking mouth breathing moron.

718
00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.710
All right.
And when it comes to being a sociopath,

719
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:03.570
that's like just a,
that's just like getting an option on the car.

720
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.110
All brains come with that option.
It's all available like satellite radio,

721
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.590
you know,
you get satellite radio in a fucking Bentley.

722
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:13.680
You can also get it my fucking Prius.
All right,

723
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.910
so did that make any fucking sense?
You got a sociopath with the fucking,

724
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.790
she could even have the a brain.

725
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.070
That's the sad thing about having a fucked up childhood.

726
00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.710
She could actually be a fucking genius,
but she's got the sociopath shit.

727
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:31.350
So tell her to go call fucking doctor drew.
All right?

728
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.180
And you get the fuck out of the relationship.
So anyways,
he say,

729
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.110
I'd imagine you'd agree that I did the right thing.
Uh,

730
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.680
but always helps to get a little bit of press,
better perspective on it.
Dude,

731
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.740
I totally understand.
You've been in a five year relationship,

732
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.750
you're emotionally invested in this shit.

733
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.030
So you know what the right thing to do is,

734
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.550
but your emotions keep fucking with you.
All right?

735
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.360
So what you got to know is just look,

736
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.860
going through a breakup is painful.
All right?

737
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.190
It's not going to not be painful,
but just because it's painful,

738
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.290
it doesn't mean that it's not the right thing to do.

739
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:12.330
You are 100 fucking percent doing the right fucking thing.

740
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.160
You're 26 year old years old.
You're in the prime of your fucking life.
All right?

741
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.430
Get out of that situation.
Okay?
She's 10 years older than you.

742
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:24.990
By the time you're 29,
she's going to be hit and fucking menopause.
All right?

743
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.600
Or something like that.
Whatever.
Sliding into it.

744
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:29.490
I have no fucking idea what she's going to be doing.

745
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.810
She's going to be wearing those mom jeans at that point if she's not already,

746
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:39.390
which I don't think she is.
She's probably that fucking,
you know that,

747
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:43.950
uh,
that anorexic cougar look,
you know,
well,

748
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:47.370
they got a varicose vein in between their fucking,
you can see their breastplate.

749
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.020
Uh,
Jesus Christ.
He'll stay on topic.
Yeah.
So to just get out of that,

750
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.960
hang out with you fucking Fellas,
you know,
hang on your buddies.

751
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.980
Go out and fucking have some beers.
Join a gym,
get fucking shredded.

752
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.900
Go out.
Start Talking Shit when you're ready.
But don't go back to that man.

753
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:05.850
You dodged a fucking bullet.

754
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.530
The fact that you were with her for five years and you didn't knock her up and

755
00:47:10.531 --> 00:47:14.460
you got out of it,
and even after five years,
you're only 26 years old,

756
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:17.670
you made the best fucking move you're going to make.
All right.

757
00:47:17.671 --> 00:47:19.020
And now this is what you need to do.

758
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:20.610
You've been in a relationship for five years.

759
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.550
You need to be single for at least a fucking year and a half.

760
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.030
And I don't mean just be single and fucking booze.

761
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.750
Figure out what the fuck you for.
All right?
And when you meet a girl,

762
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.820
if she doesn't have it,
just walk a banger in leaf.
You know,

763
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.970
there's nothing wrong with having a good fucking time,

764
00:47:39.971 --> 00:47:44.971
but do not get sucked into another fucking relationship because you're going to,

765
00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:49.450
cause you're going to have to go through this shit again.
You know,

766
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.150
we just sit there and you know what's fucking wrong,

767
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:54.790
but you don't want to go through the fucking pain of it and you keep coming
back.

768
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:58.000
It's a fucking nightmare.
It's a fucking nightmare.
Good for you,
sir.

769
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:00.250
I'm fucking proud of you.
He did the right thing.

770
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:03.250
You SORTA fucking wavering cause you're going through the motions.

771
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:06.400
You're only 26 she got with her when you were 21 is probably your first major

772
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:07.240
fucking break up.

773
00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:11.320
So it's acceptable that you fucked up and went back that second time.

774
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:13.060
But do not go back again.

775
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.430
And if any of your fucking friends are listening to this,

776
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:17.050
don't let them do that shit.
All right.

777
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.230
It's time to a bucket bar stool and stop it.

778
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.920
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

779
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:48.710
<v 4>to Yankee pictures in 1973 I never heard of this traded their wives and kids,</v>

780
00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.800
they just switched off families.
And this is the story.

781
00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.840
According to the Daily News,
1973,
um,
Fort Lauderdale,
Florida.

782
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:05.160
March,
March,
March 5th Yankee Pitcher,

783
00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.850
they call by their last names here because I guess you know,

784
00:49:08.851 --> 00:49:12.300
people know who the fuck they were checking.
K.
I.
E.
K.
I,
c.

785
00:49:12.301 --> 00:49:17.301
H and Maryland disclosed today that they had an exchange families several months

786
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.200
ago.
Peterson moving in with Susan Keck.

787
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:26.580
Rich enter two daughters and Keck rich moving in with Maryland.

788
00:49:26.581 --> 00:49:28.620
Peterson enter two sons.

789
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:34.290
The pictures in separate talks said they decided to reveal the arrangement

790
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.490
because too many people knew about it.
Evidently everybody in baseball,

791
00:49:38.491 --> 00:49:43.491
I mean you can't really keep a story like that quiet I guess all around the

792
00:49:43.531 --> 00:49:46.230
fucking spring training.
Everybody was talking about the shit.

793
00:49:46.231 --> 00:49:49.650
So they finally just went public with it.
So,
um,

794
00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:54.660
they thought it was time to clear the air and the 31 year old Peterson confided

795
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.960
that they hope that you won't make anything sorted out of this according to

796
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:02.460
Kekich.
I'm sure I'm saying that wrong.

797
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:06.630
Unless people know the full details that could turn out to be a nasty type
thing.

798
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.900
Don't say this was wiped swapping wife swapping because it wasn't,

799
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:16.620
we didn't swap wives.
We swapped lives.
Ah,

800
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:21.270
Jesus Christ.
Look at this guy fucking sprinkling a bunch of sugar over it.
Um,

801
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:26.250
I guess technically he is right dude.
How fucked up or their children

802
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:30.860
jacket.
You Dad just taps out.
Yeah,
I'm Outta here.

803
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.460
I don't want to be with your mom anymore.
And you know,
you know my best buddy,

804
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.670
he was always over here drinking beers.
Yeah,
he's going to be a dad now.

805
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.700
He's going to be banging your mom when you hear that Mona just,
no,

806
00:50:40.701 --> 00:50:44.890
that's not me doing that work or right kids and uh,
I'm Outta here.

807
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.580
Uh,
Duh.
I'm going to go fuck his wife and go raise his children.

808
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.830
Okay.
How does that sit with you?
Jesus Christ.

809
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.420
You want to talk about if they had daughters,

810
00:50:56.421 --> 00:51:00.370
you want to talk about the easiest chicks to lose your fucking virginity to the,

811
00:51:00.371 --> 00:51:03.290
there you go.
Right there.
There they are.

812
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.080
One I'm up fellas.
All right.

813
00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:10.430
New Jersey where the forehead resided for four years requires simply that the

814
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:14.630
parties proved separation for a year in order to file for divorce.

815
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.320
It's a no fault rule,
meaning no grounds are required.

816
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:24.190
You know what's amazing about this fucking story is how like that you could

817
00:51:24.801 --> 00:51:29.510
actually keep something like this quiet for a,
for a couple of months.

818
00:51:29.511 --> 00:51:33.740
Because if you ever tried to do any bullshit like this,
uh,

819
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:35.690
today,
I mean Jesus Christ,

820
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:40.430
three different 24 hour sports networks and ESPN alone.
The first is network.

821
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.890
I mean,
then you got TMZ would jump up that would just TMC late night talk shows.

822
00:51:45.891 --> 00:51:50.040
They got like 58 of them now.
Oh my God,

823
00:51:50.041 --> 00:51:51.000
it'd be over manager.

824
00:51:51.001 --> 00:51:55.470
Ralph Houk said it was a situation that he could live with a,

825
00:51:55.471 --> 00:51:59.400
that it would not rip apart his team and that it still had its best chance of

826
00:51:59.401 --> 00:52:01.650
winning a pennant since 1964.

827
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:06.360
I always like Ralph Elk fucking kept it positive.
Uh,
just for the record,

828
00:52:06.361 --> 00:52:09.300
they went 80 and 80 to two games of under 500.

829
00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:14.070
Jesus fucking Christ.
Jesus Christ.

830
00:52:14.071 --> 00:52:16.700
How the fuck he is the top that obscure staff

831
00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:22.380
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

832
00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:44.230
<v 4>that's plow ahead.
Oh,
by the way,
I've really pissed off a lot of potheads.</v>

833
00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.180
Evidently on my podcast.
They think that I,

834
00:52:46.181 --> 00:52:50.800
I am against smoking weed and then I'm trashing that whole fucking lifestyle.

835
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:56.170
Why don't you guys go take another head off your fucking blunt and fucking
relax.

836
00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:59.740
All right.
Just because I,
I trashed that guy

837
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:06.460
who was a pot smoker.
I wasn't saying that weed was a bad thing.
All right.

838
00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.280
At this point with those vaporizers that they have,

839
00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:14.730
it's probably fucking 10 times healthier than sitting around drinking a six

840
00:53:15.371 --> 00:53:20.350
pack.
I don't have a fucking problem.
I wasn't talking about smoking weed.

841
00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.080
I was,
I wasn't,
I was making fun of a loser.

842
00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:27.970
I was telling that woman that she was dating a fucking loser.
All right.
As a man,

843
00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:32.000
your job is to go out and fucking provide,
you know,

844
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:36.620
and when somebody breaks into your house not to shit yourself and to grab the

845
00:53:36.621 --> 00:53:40.010
nearest blunt object and fucking go brave harder on him,

846
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.480
that's what you're supposed to do.
You know me,
I would shit myself,

847
00:53:44.481 --> 00:53:49.400
lock myself in the bathroom and called nine one one of course,
but I can provide,

848
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:54.140
goddammit.
It's when I got a fifth fucking pit bull for,
um,

849
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:58.490
speaking of that,
I watched no country for old men again,
man,

850
00:53:58.491 --> 00:54:00.560
what a fucking awesome movie that is.

851
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:04.160
That is just absolutely phenomenal fucking movie.

852
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.310
It actually made me sad that we were in final descent.

853
00:54:07.311 --> 00:54:10.420
That's how good that goddamn movie is.
Um,
but anyways,

854
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:14.600
so I just know that potheads I'm not making fun.
You know,

855
00:54:14.601 --> 00:54:18.800
if I make fun of some guy who's a booze bag,
booze bag,

856
00:54:18.801 --> 00:54:21.830
fucking losers sitting around drinking bear all day on the couch,

857
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:26.120
that doesn't mean that I don't think that anybody should drink.

858
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.393
All right.

859
00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:28.620
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

860
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:32.500
<v 4>So fucking relax.
Jesus Christ.</v>

861
00:54:32.501 --> 00:54:35.520
I thought you got mellow when you smoke weed.
Um,

862
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:37.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

863
00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:40.070
<v 4>Anyways,
let's plow ahead.
Hey Paul,</v>

864
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:43.890
can you guys basically just admit that you want weed to be free just so you can

865
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:47.110
just sit around,
smoke it,
and not have to worry about anybody hassle and yeah.

866
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.360
You know,
to use a classic Hippie word,

867
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.810
why can't you just admit that and stopped telling me about,
you know,

868
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:59.330
how the fucking declaration of independence was written on hemp and all,

869
00:54:59.331 --> 00:55:03.460
all these,
you know,
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

870
00:55:03.461 --> 00:55:07.110
she can make a potted plant out of a 40 and an empty 40 ounce.

871
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:10.020
I'm not going to sit there and act like I don't wish that I,

872
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:12.870
I want to drink in public.
Right?
Dude,

873
00:55:12.871 --> 00:55:15.790
my brain shut down seven minutes ago.
I don't even,

874
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.300
what the fuck I'm talking about?
I need to start reading again.

875
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.840
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
