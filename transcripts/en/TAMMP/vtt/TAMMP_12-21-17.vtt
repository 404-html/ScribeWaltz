00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.320
Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning now?
It isn't.

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.310
Oh God damn it.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.
Just before Friday.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.050
Monday morning podcast and um,
dre,

4
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:19.330
big of checking in on you.
Ooh,

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.490
Jess.
Like the freckled cantar yeah.

6
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.190
Do they have Christmas music and other countries?

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.750
Is it strictly an American thing?
I can't imagine.

8
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:35.430
You're an England and they give a shit.

9
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
<v 1>About Ben Crosby go on where the trees are glistening and chill.</v>

11
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.570
Dread lists him.

12
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.980
They don't even have like enough fields over there for sleigh bells to go

13
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:53.920
through.
Right.
There's no fucking room over there in England.

14
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:55.150
It's all been developed.

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.150
<v 1>That's why we ended up coming over here.
Was it because of religious differences?</v>

17
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.040
There was too much urban sprawl over the,
I even back in the 16 hundreds.

18
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.650
<v 1>That's why people's teeth in England is so God damn crooked.</v>

20
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
It's not because they don't take care of the teeth are all mashed together.

21
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.523
<v 2>I'm sorry.</v>

22
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.030
<v 1>I had no intention of getting on this podcast and insulting.</v>

23
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.790
<v 2>MMM.</v>

24
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.530
<v 1>The great state of England.
You know,
there's a lot of great states out there,</v>

25
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.320
right?
Rhode Island,
Connecticut in England,

26
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.070
England is an incredible state.
It's about the size of New Jersey.

27
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.730
You got to admit,
man,
for such a small country,
they've,
you know,
they definitely,

28
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.920
definitely let themselves be known around the world for better or for worse,

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.820
depending on what side or the queen you're sitting on.

30
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.343
<v 2>MMM.</v>

31
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.810
<v 1>Why would I,
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm talking about?
You know what?</v>

32
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:53.540
I don't give a shit cause technically I'm on vacation.

33
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.880
<v 1>Um,
I don't even feel that.</v>

35
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.370
I don't even feel like I need to be making an effort at this point.

36
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.593
<v 2>MMM.</v>

37
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.020
<v 1>Who knows.
I'll probably lose another fucking advertising.
Oh,
we trying to sell a,</v>

38
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.950
we're trying to sell pencils over and you'd the United Kingdom,

39
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:14.340
but we just felt some of your,
some of your statements.

40
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.480
<v 1>So you just went beyond comedy and just can't get into a area that we didn't</v>

42
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:23.270
feel was inclusive.

43
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.750
<v 1>And those people,
everything's a question.</v>

45
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.510
They're like literally taking the piss out of you were saying,
you know,

46
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:31.490
I just felt like you're not,

47
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.940
we just feel like you're not doing the job we need to be done.

48
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.350
That needs to be done

49
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.850
and that you're going to be unemployed during the holidays.

50
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.440
That would be best for us.

51
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.783
<v 0>Okay.</v>

52
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.940
<v 1>The ultimate passive aggressiveness is you walk around and you don't have the</v>

53
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:59.070
common decency just to just be stand there flat footed,

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.820
be the client that you are.
Instead you do everything with questions.

55
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.370
So that's when I stole your password for your bank account

56
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.990
and depleted all your savings.
So I'm sorry,

57
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.480
I'm writing this from the Cayman Islands.
MMM.

58
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.260
Anyways,
I'm bad.
I'm bad back in Boston baby.

59
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.390
A lot of bees there.
Lottery Sean,
the racial past blue rebel.

60
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.850
I'm a Cajun man.

61
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.350
Adam Sandler weekend update back in the day when I was young.
Um,

62
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.300
I'm back here in Boston and uh,

63
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.840
this is my first Christmas is a dead,
it's pretty exciting.

64
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.070
I made a promise to myself that I was not going to flip out.

65
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.540
<v 1>At all.
That I was just going to be,</v>

67
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:01.070
I was going to be as rosy as my daughter's cheeks are right now because she's

68
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:03.540
teething.
Um,

69
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.900
and I was able to do that until I picked up the rental car.

70
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.160
I lost my shit twice,
maybe three times.

71
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.410
I vaguely remember taking my hat off and throwing it as hard as I can down at

72
00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:23.840
the empty passenger seat,
you know,

73
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.720
like it was the end of the game and there was a terrible call.

74
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.970
Like somebody scored a touchdown and they said,
oh wait,

75
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.360
you didn't make a football move and now I gotta be on the road during the

76
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:36.620
playoffs.
Play off.
All right,
here's what happened.

77
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.930
Um,
we had a very early flight and,
uh,

78
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.560
and this is the first time I was flying.
No,
no second time.

79
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.540
Second time flying with my wife and daughter.

80
00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:50.930
But the first time he did my Kiddo was so young,
you know what I mean?

81
00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:55.490
It was like bringing a loaf of bread with you.
You know,

82
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.690
she was really into being held back then and snuggled and all that type of
stuff.

83
00:04:59.691 --> 00:05:04.691
Well now my kids mobile go in mole by all right.

84
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.450
I believe she's what they call cruising at this point,
which means she,

85
00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:13.451
she can pull herself up on a table and then walk side decided to like all kinds

86
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:17.520
of stuff like that.
Although yesterday she actually let go of a table,

87
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:20.850
turned around and then reached for something else.

88
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:23.850
Now she's never done that before.
What she would do,
it'd be like,
wow,

89
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:28.590
that's way over there.
I'm not going to go down,
sit on my butt,

90
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.820
crawl half a step and then pull myself back up again.
This is the first time,

91
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.470
you know,
she did sort of a wrestling move,
like coming off the rope,

92
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.630
spinning around.
She did everything but a flying kick.

93
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:43.890
So my days are numbered as far as
you know,

94
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:47.790
being able to stick her in a general area and turning my back and expecting her

95
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:52.740
to still be there.
Um,
so now,
yeah,
she wants to move around.

96
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:56.700
I got to tell you something.
She was an absolute angel on the plane.

97
00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.810
Oh wait,
am I hearing other shit here?

98
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.720
What the fuck has that been going on?
The whole podcast.
Sorry,

99
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:09.200
I have my headphones on.
What fucking advertiser.

100
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.610
Oh,
that's right,
that's right.
I was on Google plus.
Well,

101
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:15.860
I'm sorry for the Guy Mumbling in the background.

102
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.430
<v 0>Okay.</v>

103
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.950
<v 1>It wasn't some crazy relative.</v>

104
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.860
<v 0>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.120
<v 1>This is some old guy talking about how the u s and the Chai Chinese China need</v>

106
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:27.110
to communicate.

107
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.640
<v 0>Oh,
is that what we need to do?</v>

108
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.830
<v 1>Why don't we all just fucking leave each other alone?
How about that?</v>

109
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.210
How about we stay over here?
You stay over there.
You shoot your missiles.

110
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:38.931
That yourself.

111
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:42.260
We'll fucking throw our shit ourselves if we feel like we want to kill somebody.

112
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:43.094
Why don't we just do that?

113
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.690
Why does it everybody in the world just grow the Fuck Up,
Huh?

114
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.193
<v 0>Okay.</v>

115
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.710
<v 1>All of this bullshit about fucking going to war and all of that crap.</v>

116
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.000
It's just a bunch of rich people at the top throwing temper tantrums because

117
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.540
they want some sort of oil or they want some sort of land.

118
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:06.560
They want some soda water outlet or they don't feel that you're praying to the

119
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:09.950
right fucking person or they don't like your form of government.

120
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:14.920
Who gives a fuck?
You know,
you think I like all of my neighbors.

121
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.370
I don't dislike any of my neighbors.
But you know,
in the past

122
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.770
I haven't liked my neighbor's music.
I,
when I lived in New York,

123
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.690
I didn't like the smell of their food.

124
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.020
I didn't like listening to them arguing or fucking,
or what,

125
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.900
you know what you do in New York City.
But did I ever go,

126
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.170
did I go on the fucking warpath

127
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.000
did I?
Did I fucking,
you know,

128
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.870
sucker punched somebody as they came walking out of the apartment though?
I did.

129
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:49.040
You know why?
Because I'm a fucking adult.
All right.

130
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.230
And I think a tight time that Democrats are public gets to the Pentagon and

131
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:57.200
everyone around her fucking just grow up.

132
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.490
<v 0>Yes.</v>

133
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.170
<v 1>Just fucking grow up already.
I gotta be honest.
You,</v>

134
00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:04.210
I cannot believe that war is still illegal.

135
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.120
The risk of sounding like the fucking tree hugger.

136
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.770
I can't believe that that it's a a,
it's still illegal.
You know what this is,

137
00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:14.320
this is my simple theory that I worked out by myself.

138
00:08:14.321 --> 00:08:17.230
So there was no one there to argue with me.
So it completely makes sense.

139
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.060
I definitely believe that you have to be a little sick.

140
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

141
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.610
<v 1>To want to lead a nation.</v>

142
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.550
<v 0>Um,
so</v>

143
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.260
<v 1>I think that yeah,</v>

144
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.450
got a lot of fucking complete lunatics in power and they,

145
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.660
they make those choices like a,

146
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.900
like what's his face,
Martin Sheen in the dead zone.
The birds are away,

147
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.270
gentleman,
the birds are away.
Right.

148
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.230
<v 0>Okay.</v>

149
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.000
<v 1>That's Kinda how I look at,
uh,</v>

150
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.500
<v 0>okay.</v>

151
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.770
<v 1>Most of these fucking people that run corporations and all of type of shit.</v>

152
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.993
<v 2>Uh,</v>

153
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.930
<v 1>and I dunno what happened.
This all just got depressing,</v>

154
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.120
which is why I don't watch the fucking news.

155
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.740
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.380
<v 1>Fill this plenty of water.
There's plenty of food.</v>

157
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.670
There's plenty of room for everybody.
If everybody would just fucking relax,

158
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:13.391
you know,

159
00:09:13.391 --> 00:09:17.440
and quit peeking over your fence to see what other people have and just be happy

160
00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:18.760
with what the fuck you have.

161
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.480
We can have a nice Jane farmer's market every Sunday.
Okay.

162
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.500
Oh,
you got a barrel oil?
Oh yeah,
we got a box of snickers bars.

163
00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:34.060
How about that?
We'll do a little fucking change here.
Um,
anyways,

164
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.120
so I'm flying on the God damn five.
I'm sorry for the fucking audio.

165
00:09:37.121 --> 00:09:38.590
I don't have time to change that shit.

166
00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:40.740
I apologize for the Guy Mumbling in the background.

167
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.863
<v 2>Uh,</v>

168
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.810
<v 1>it's sort of my,
my tribute to dark side of the moon.
You know,</v>

169
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:47.130
that guy's mumbling,
all that shit.

170
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.710
There really is no dark side of the moon and it's all dark.

171
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.873
<v 2>MMM.</v>

172
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.000
<v 1>So we did great on the plane.
Everybody was loving my daughter over there,</v>

173
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.420
you know,
she was just peeking over the seats,
waving at everybody.

174
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.310
Flight attendants were carrying her,
walking up and down the aisle.
It was great.

175
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.530
Um,
by the end,
she had everybody loving her just smiling and waving.

176
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:13.290
I'm going to try that on a flight.
I'm going to start peaking over the seat,

177
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:18.000
just smiling and waving at people like fucking lunatic.
Oh my God.

178
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.060
I was sick.
Fucking song is in my head.

179
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.120
I know the daughter has this little little car that when you fucking turn it on,

180
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.610
how's it [inaudible] and I love driving on the road to,

181
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.080
to be,
be grabbing all the,
around that town waving to all.

182
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:41.340
I meet smiling,
waving B,
B

183
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.370
over and over again.
So anyways,

184
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:49.650
I did great on the flight.
I mean,
you know,

185
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:53.580
I made a promise that I wasn't going to flip out this whole,
this whole trip.

186
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.103
Wow.

187
00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.310
I would say I was able to do it until the rental car.
Right.

188
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.310
All right.
All right.
We're going to eat.
Okay.
Text me when you're done.

189
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.020
Just stay here working during my vacation.
Thanks for coming in and helping out.

190
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.360
Definitely when you're done.
Okay.

191
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.713
<v 2>MMM.</v>

192
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.100
<v 1>So anyways,
I,
I,</v>

193
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:21.130
we go to get off the plane and it's the usual battle between a man and a woman.

194
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.050
The guy's thinking,
okay,
we checked bags.
We also have to pick up a rental car.

195
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:28.570
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

196
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.820
<v 1>It's going to be all these fucking people there.
All right.</v>

197
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.430
He's going to be a bunch of people traveling.

198
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:38.180
It's going to take forever to get the bags.
Why don't I,

199
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.710
while you guys wait to get the bags,
I'll get on the fucking bus,

200
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.060
the rental car bus and I will go over

201
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.053
<v 2>okay.</v>

202
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.140
<v 1>To pick up the fucking rental car,</v>

203
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.980
you know,
and my

204
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.790
<v 2>wife is a Homerun,
right?
Always was a woman by the way.</v>

205
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:01.830
She did not transition just to be progressive and give all you the information.

206
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:03.933
MMM.

207
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.210
<v 1>She's a woman.
So she wants to be social.</v>

208
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.640
<v 3>Oh,
I thought we could all go over there together.</v>

209
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.970
Why this is me imitating you right now.

210
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.950
I thought we could all go there together.
She just gave me the finger.

211
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.720
<v 1>Uh,
and I'm like,
honey,</v>

212
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.200
we have three check packs.
I didn't want to check a bag.
I was going to travel.

213
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.170
Oh,
good kids.
Kids screaming in there.
Um,

214
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.840
I didn't want to check it back.
I was just going to pack like,

215
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.920
I was going to go do a funny bone asub shit.
Right?
A couple pairs of pants,

216
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:48.640
a couple of headliners,
shirts,
sweatpants and a t shirt.
Right.

217
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:51.460
But she's just saying,
what if,
what if we go out to eat?

218
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.300
What if we get some Christmas gifts to,
we need space.

219
00:12:55.301 --> 00:13:00.250
Just could you just please beg a giant bag.

220
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.300
So I took out my fucking bag that,
you know,

221
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.590
I don't even use the last time I went to Europe because I finally learned how to

222
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:09.490
fucking pack.

223
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.010
So we had three of those fucking things.
So I'm like honey,

224
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.820
we're going to get off the plane first cause we're riding up front like fancy

225
00:13:20.821 --> 00:13:21.654
people.

226
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.340
We're going to stand down there for a good 1520 minutes while the rest of the

227
00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:27.420
people file down.

228
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.470
And then we'll stand there for another five minutes before the bell turns on.

229
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.130
And then after the belt turns on and everybody's excited,

230
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.000
it's just going to shut off.
And then everybody's going to be like,
what the fuck?

231
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.410
And then another belt two belts over is going to turn on.
Okay.

232
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.310
And some smarty pants is going to figure out that that's actually where our

233
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:49.144
flight,
it's,

234
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.400
except he's not going to tell anybody cause he's a selfish cunt and he's going

235
00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:54.340
to stand over there.

236
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:58.030
And then gradually people will start noticing faces from their flight,

237
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.280
two belts over,
getting bags,

238
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:04.090
not telling everybody so they can get out in the taxi line before anybody else.

239
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.700
Then there's going to be a stampede of fucking people.

240
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.620
This is basically what's going to happen.

241
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:11.110
And this is the reason why I don't check a bag.

242
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.113
<v 2>Okay.</v>

243
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.650
<v 1>But in loyalty and dedication to you
in our little family unit,</v>

244
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.630
I chose to do that.
So all of this shit's going to be going down.
All right?

245
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:28.770
As we stand there going,
what the fuck's going on?
Meanwhile,

246
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.730
I could be over there getting the car.
All right?

247
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.180
And then I could get the car and just as the belt starts,

248
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.780
I could already be driving back smiling,
waving bee beep.

249
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.750
Right?
I like picking up my car to,

250
00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:48.480
to be be,
um,

251
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.553
<v 2>yeah,</v>

252
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.400
<v 1>so much to my,
she goes</v>

253
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.740
<v 2>all,
okay.
And I'm like,
yes.
Right.</v>

254
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.390
<v 1>So I dunno if you guys have ever been to Boston,</v>

255
00:15:01.391 --> 00:15:05.140
but I don't know what this fucking city has against signage.

256
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.740
They have plenty of signs,
but none really tell you where to go.

257
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.200
They're all sort of vague and there's arrows pointing you in the general

258
00:15:14.201 --> 00:15:18.820
direction.
And then at the last second,
the place you want to be after,

259
00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:21.400
you want to make the turn right behind that road.

260
00:15:21.401 --> 00:15:23.890
As you're driving 40 miles an hour will be assigned,

261
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.380
pointing at the road that you're currently passing

262
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.060
with whatever it is that you're looking for in the smallest print

263
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.720
<v 2>ever.
So</v>

264
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.850
<v 1>I get on the bus,
I walk out the buses right there.
I'm like,
Bam,</v>

265
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.003
<v 2>all right,</v>

266
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.080
<v 1>I have my fucking,
you know,</v>

267
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.400
I got my confirmation number and everything.
I see some dad coming out his,

268
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:52.810
his family all gets on the bus.
He has to carry on.
It's in a child seat.

269
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.820
Whereas the wife,
she's with the kids,
she carried the kids on,

270
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.840
you know the ones that can walk with their own power and they go and sit down.

271
00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:06.841
So this poor bastard runs back to the curb to get the child seat.

272
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.590
All these fucking assholes on the bus just staring at the guy.

273
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.250
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

274
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.840
<v 1>it's like people,
we're all in the same team here.
We can't go until this guy,</v>

275
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:21.290
this poor bastard.
It gets all this shit on the bus.
How about you help out?
Right.

276
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.310
Everybody's standing there,
so the guy comes fucking running over.

277
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.210
It's got this stupid chair,
the child seat things.

278
00:16:28.211 --> 00:16:30.020
So I just reached out and he hands it to me.

279
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.773
<v 2>Right?</v>

280
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.040
<v 1>And he's just fucking,
I don't even think he said thank you.
He fucking runs back.</v>

281
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.790
I put the chair up where it needs to go.
He shows up with the other two bags.

282
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:44.690
I help him up with one blahblahblahblahblah and he sets everything down and I'm

283
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:48.890
waiting for a big,
hey man,
thanks a lot.
You know,
little dad,
fist bump,

284
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.940
he doesn't say anything.
He just looks at his wife and smiles and goes,

285
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:56.720
they're all on and then walks back to where his wife and kids are.

286
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.790
And all I'm thinking is,
what a fucking,
where's my pat on the back?

287
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.350
I didn't have to do that.
It didn't say a fucking word.

288
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.300
So then immediately in my head I'm like,
oh,

289
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.880
this of he's got a fucking management position,
doesn't,

290
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.780
he's got an expense account.
You know,

291
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.220
like you'd be on the fucking rental car bus.
I was just like,
you know what?

292
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:19.910
Fuck this guy.
This guy is somebody's boss and he's a Douche.

293
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.170
I shouldn't have done that.
Right?

294
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.843
<v 2>Whatever.</v>

295
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.880
<v 1>So the bus is pulling up,</v>

296
00:17:24.881 --> 00:17:27.940
it's fucking jam packed with people and I'm doing a fucking head count,
right?

297
00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:31.810
We go by the Blue Line,
a third of the bus gets off and all,

298
00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:33.100
I'm thinking it's a fuck.

299
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.670
I recently just switched over to hertz because budget has their head up their

300
00:17:36.671 --> 00:17:37.504
ass.

301
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.303
<v 2>So</v>

302
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.910
<v 1>all I'm thinking is I got to get off this fucking bus and I got to be part of</v>

303
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:48.200
that first third so I'm not standing in the line because my wife is probably,

304
00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.840
God knows now that I'm over here,
it's probably getting the bags and she's

305
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.280
<v 4>be like,
see,
it wasn't the [inaudible].
See I was actually right.</v>

306
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.520
See?

307
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.463
<v 1>So anyways,</v>

308
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:00.900
<v 0>okay,</v>

309
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.770
<v 1>the bus doors open.
I'm the second person off the bus.</v>

310
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.070
It's one of those buses that's dragging another bus.
That's how big it is.

311
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.070
And I shamelessly,

312
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.180
with my backpack sprint past everybody,

313
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.200
sprint 49 years old.
Alright,

314
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.400
sprinting.

315
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.660
<v 5>But it ended at dead,
dead,
dead,
dead,
dead,
dead.</v>

316
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.840
The De de,
De,
De,
De,
de,
de

317
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.100
<v 1>fucking running NFL films could have filmed this and showed it and fucking slow</v>

318
00:18:32.621 --> 00:18:33.210
motion,
right?
Yeah.

319
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.280
<v 5>Barnett Barnett,
Barnett matter,</v>

320
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.770
<v 1>fucking run by everybody.
I'm the first person in,</v>

321
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.710
there's one person in line and hurts and he's already being helped and I fucking

322
00:18:44.711 --> 00:18:49.480
run
all the way up and I'm right fucking there and wouldn't,

323
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:51.580
you know,
I couldn't believe it.

324
00:18:51.581 --> 00:18:56.050
There was some other lady up there and she just goes,
hello sir,
welcome to hurts.

325
00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.980
Can I help you out?
I'm like,
Oh my God,
this is so much better than budget.

326
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.590
Okay.
I got my fucking reservation number ready cause I know,

327
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.520
I know they're not going to have my car ready because this is everything.

328
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.750
It's going,
it's going too good.
So she goes,

329
00:19:13.751 --> 00:19:16.890
what's the last name?
And I go birth.
She goes,
bar.

330
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.360
Oh I have your reservation reservation right here.
I'm like,

331
00:19:19.361 --> 00:19:23.640
you gotta be kidding me.
I go,
is it an SUV?

332
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.820
It's an SUV.
Do you got a kid seat?
We got a kid.

333
00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:30.540
See you've got one of those little,
Sadie's save fucky Fucka

334
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.170
passes.
So I can go through the God damn title.
Yes we do.
Bang,
Bang,

335
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:41.460
bub.
Right?
Smiling,
waving.
She's great.
I get it.
I go,

336
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:45.090
you gotta be shitting me.
So I fucking walk out.
I make a right

337
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.300
space.
Number nine,
10 bear.
She is,
I throw my bags in the back,

338
00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:54.990
I fucking get in the car.
Now I'm trying to figure out how to get out.

339
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:57.330
There's like 50 signs that say ag,
the exit.

340
00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:00.570
I'm driving in a fucking circle trying to get out of there and I start to start

341
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:05.260
losing my shit a little bit.
Does every time I go to rent a car,

342
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.180
I always have to double back because everything says exit.

343
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.490
Every aisle says exit and then you realize,
oh,
that's for me.

344
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:15.950
If I just pulled out here,
it's so fucking stupid.

345
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.400
So I pull up and as you know,
I do the whole thing.
Hey,
thank you very much,

346
00:20:22.401 --> 00:20:24.990
Yada Yada Yada.
We'll see later and then it rises on pulling out and go,

347
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:28.500
wait a minute,
is there a child seat in this thing?
I turned around,

348
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:29.490
there's no child seat.

349
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:30.720
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

350
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.350
<v 1>I just talked to the lady
the fucking way</v>

351
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.590
and she told me there was going to be one in there like an asshole.

352
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:46.150
I took her fucking word for it.
I took a fucking word for that.

353
00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:47.800
These God damn people,

354
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:51.970
we're going to put a car seat and then they don't have it and I'm driving out

355
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.210
now.

356
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.610
I pull over and now there's somebody behind me beeping because I'm the captain

357
00:20:55.611 --> 00:20:57.850
now who's like looking back in disbelief.

358
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.250
I shut off the car.
I opened the back end.
That's right.

359
00:21:02.251 --> 00:21:04.350
And then I got back in to see that there was no car seats,

360
00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:08.240
so I'm starting to lose my shit.
This guy behind me beeps the horn.
Yeah.

361
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.000
I'm trying not to get mad and I'm like fucking cock suckers to lose my mind.

362
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:15.570
Now I got to somehow figure out how to go back in.

363
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.043
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

364
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.490
<v 1>So driving around and my brain's going,
don't call your wife right now.</v>

365
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:26.170
Don't call your wife.
So what do I do?
Call my wife.

366
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.700
She picks up the phone.
I go near these fucking assholes.

367
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:33.370
So I've got to put a car seat in there.
She goes,
oh,
well we're here,

368
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.340
we have the bags.
But they didn't,

369
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.790
they lost my mom's bag and all of a sudden it's turning into planes,

370
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:42.850
trains and automobiles.
This nice smooth trip.

371
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.370
My kid was great,

372
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.350
my wife agreed that I could break off and actually efficiently get the car while

373
00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:54.340
they wait for the bags.
They had my reservation,
they had every,

374
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.930
all the Cutera mall that I needed in the car.
And I was like,
I knew it.

375
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.770
I knew it was going to say.
And I just,
I somehow I went off on millennials,

376
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.940
like they're running hurts.

377
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.360
Like it's not a bunch of people from my generation and older.

378
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

379
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.300
<v 1>And I fucking threw my hat down screaming at the top of my lungs.</v>

380
00:22:11.301 --> 00:22:13.670
Every curse word I could possibly muster up.

381
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

382
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.040
<v 1>Going these God damn fucking millennials,</v>

383
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.950
they can't fucking do anything right.

384
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.250
Because they spend their entire life looking at a fucking screen.

385
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.300
They can't solve any problems.
Cause anytime they have a problem,

386
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.111
they either call,

387
00:22:28.111 --> 00:22:32.310
their parents are fucking Uber and somebody shows up and pulls him out.
You know,

388
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.760
like a fucking helicopter pilot in Vietnam.

389
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.253
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

390
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.130
<v 1>Just comes chopper and in and lifts him up out of their fucking problems.</v>

391
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.070
So I fucking drive back

392
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.440
and I fucking pull in and as I come walking around,

393
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:55.710
getting ready for a battle,
this fucking hurt guy from parts comes walking out.

394
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.790
He goes,
hey,
how are you?
I go,
yeah,
I was supposed to have a child seat.

395
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.400
I don't have one.
He goes,
well,
I can help you out with that.

396
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.583
<v 0>Okay,</v>

397
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.820
<v 1>I would.
He'd was so nicely to fuse all my anger.</v>

398
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:09.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

399
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.450
<v 1>So he walks around the back,
he goes,
all right,
there's a child seats.</v>

400
00:23:12.451 --> 00:23:15.480
Which one do you want?
How old she?
She goes,
which one do you want?
I go,

401
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:17.520
the one that's going to not make my kid die.

402
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.250
I was still a little angry and he kind of gave me a look like,
Ooh,

403
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.720
I was a little harsh.
So he goes,
I met,
how old is your kid?
I'm like,
11 months.

404
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.250
And he goes,
all right,
we got to,

405
00:23:26.251 --> 00:23:29.370
we got a black one and we've got like a pinkish one a,
is it a boy or girl?

406
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.370
It's a girl.
He goes,
I,
we'll get the pink one.
And then he literally,

407
00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:33.810
this is a guy in his sixties he goes,

408
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.170
not to say they did anything wrong if you have a boy.
I said,
dude,

409
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:39.720
you don't have to do that progressive shit with me any left.

410
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:41.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

411
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.960
<v 1>You know,
like,
it's fine</v>

412
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.020
not to say if he wanted to raise your kid gender neutral oak,

413
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.740
your kid was already transitioning and 11 months,
you know,

414
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:53.870
started doing all that shit,
covering his tracks,

415
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:58.610
like he was fucking running for office.
So I'm like,
Oh my God,
this guy is great.

416
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.600
As always,
I flipped out.
I'm a fucking asshole.
I should've looked.

417
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.880
All I had to do is look,
and if I looked,

418
00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:07.640
I could have just met this guy would have been fine,
right?

419
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.590
So he gives me the seat and I go,
all right,
how do I get this in there?
He goes,

420
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.700
AH,
legally

421
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:20.060
I'm not allowed to put that seed in or tell you how to do it for legal purposes.

422
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.060
Any promptly turns and walks away

423
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:30.060
and he's walking away.
I'm like,
so that's it.
You just get to walk away.

424
00:24:30.061 --> 00:24:33.660
And he doesn't say a fucking word guy.
Smiley.
Just,

425
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.090
I know we heard me just turned and walked away and that was it.

426
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.143
<v 0>Okay.</v>

427
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.100
<v 1>And I was like,
oh,</v>

428
00:24:39.101 --> 00:24:43.060
so this is why the child seat wasn't in there because they're not going to put

429
00:24:43.061 --> 00:24:46.390
it in there,
even though they know how to put it in there,

430
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.760
but they don't want to have the liability.

431
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.790
So of course now I go to put the fucking thing in there.

432
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.900
I figured out how to Hook it in and this thing has enough goddamned slack on it.

433
00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:00.460
It's like a fucking,
you ever see those youtube videos where they start,

434
00:25:00.461 --> 00:25:03.640
you know they're filming some kid that they're pulling down the street and like

435
00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:08.641
a fucking wagon or I dunno what a boogie board or resigns skis with roller

436
00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:11.530
skates.
That's how this thing is flying around.
I was just like,
fuck it.

437
00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:16.090
We'll figure it out.
So I head back to United.

438
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.970
Oh,
here's another great thing about Logan Airport.

439
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.710
This is how bad signages in Boston when you pull into Logan Airport,

440
00:25:23.711 --> 00:25:26.620
just to give you a heads up,
if you drive back with the fucking rental car,

441
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.080
you're gonna drive into the airport.

442
00:25:29.081 --> 00:25:34.081
There's going to be a giant fucking sign with every air carrier that they have

443
00:25:34.361 --> 00:25:35.200
there at the airport.

444
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.390
It'll say letter a United fucking air,

445
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.460
uh,
air fucking Brazil,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

446
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:50.110
Be Delta,
American Airlines,
Air Ethiopia,
Yada,
Yada,

447
00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:54.670
Yada.
All A,
B,
c,
d,
right?
You have to drive by,

448
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.830
sift through every fucking airline there is.
Okay.

449
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.430
As you drive and by 30 miles an hour with somebody beeping behind you.

450
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:08.170
If you're lucky,
you find your airline.
And then for the love of God,

451
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.530
memorize the letter.
Because after that,

452
00:26:11.531 --> 00:26:16.360
they're not listing any more fucking airlines.
It's just going to say B,

453
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:21.250
c,
d,
that's our a,
B,
c,
d,
e.
And you got to remember what the fuck was mine.

454
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.840
Well,
where I was picking up the rental car.

455
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.480
<v 0>Okay?</v>

456
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.220
<v 1>I was already past that sign.</v>

457
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.490
So now I'm like,
what the fuck?
So I have to call Nia

458
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.120
as I already went by a,
I'm like Nia.

459
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:40.470
<v 0>Okay,</v>

460
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.570
<v 1>what,
what terminal you?
And she asks him,</v>

461
00:26:42.571 --> 00:26:46.200
he be right as I'm driving by beat and I fucking have to do this hard,
right.

462
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.970
I go in there and it right as I pull in,
I see on the,
um,

463
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.410
you know,
the exit where you turn in,
there's a sign that says be in the lists.

464
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:57.600
All of them,
all the airlines,
super small.

465
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:01.380
But this is the greatest thing about Boston.
It's not before you get to the turn,

466
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.150
it's right after it.

467
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.810
They're the fucking worst out here.
So we pull in,

468
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.810
<v 2>okay.</v>

469
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:10.860
<v 1>And uh,
you know,</v>

470
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:14.040
and of course it takes me another three phone calls once I'm in B to figure out

471
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:15.300
where the hell my wife is.

472
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:17.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

473
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.020
<v 1>We then fill up the fucking car.</v>

474
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

475
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:20.690
<v 1>You know,</v>

476
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:25.190
there's not enough fucking room because they gave us like a midsize SUV.

477
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.210
I mean,
actually,
thank God my mother in law has a bag.

478
00:27:29.211 --> 00:27:32.330
Didn't come because we wouldn't have had the fucking room.
Anyways,

479
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.810
they ended up being on the next flight.
She got us.
Thank God for that.
So,

480
00:27:35.811 --> 00:27:37.910
but now I'm thinking like a,
when we go back to the airport,

481
00:27:37.911 --> 00:27:40.580
I have to put somebody in a fucking cab with their bag.

482
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.580
<v 2>Um,
and then</v>

483
00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.940
<v 1>I get on.
So I've already lost my shit.
I lost it twice.</v>

484
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.780
<v 2>All right.
Once calling up the,</v>

485
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.670
<v 1>I guess that's once and then I lost my shit yelling about millennials for</v>

486
00:27:56.671 --> 00:27:59.940
whatever reason,
as if they're already running hearts.

487
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:04.560
My apologies to millennials.
Okay.
You guys,
she just like hipsters.
Okay.

488
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.920
You're getting way more shit than you deserve.
You're not all

489
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:11.250
<v 2>bad.
All right,
so</v>

490
00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.700
<v 1>I fucking,
and then I yelled at the,
I yelled at the fucking</v>

491
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.920
<v 2>car seat guy.</v>

492
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.210
<v 1>You know who now I don't believe his mood.
I think it was all just a tactic.
Hey,</v>

493
00:28:24.211 --> 00:28:28.800
how are you?
Absolutely.
Here's your kid.
Seek,
go fuck yourself.
That was his vibe.

494
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.590
Um,
legally go fuck yourself.
So,
uh,
anyway,

495
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.770
I,
um,
I finally find where my wife is.

496
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.680
We bring all the bags out,
we stick everything in,

497
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.120
and then I go to get on the Ted Williams tunnel,
which really is,

498
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.760
it really should have been
in an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard.

499
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:57.090
If they reboot the dukes of hazard as it rebooting every fucking show.

500
00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.293
<v 2>MMM.</v>

501
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.000
<v 1>The amount of a fuck over that.
The big dig was</v>

502
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.830
the fucking Ted Williams tunnel starts off.
It's four lanes across like,
wow,

503
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.140
this is great.
Then it goes down to three.

504
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.280
Then it goes down to two who builds a fucking two laned fucking

505
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.283
<v 2>tunnel</v>

506
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.270
<v 1>in the last 2030 years?
Who the fuck has done that?</v>

507
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.520
Like the entire big dig is,

508
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.250
it's like two fucking lanes that goes down to one lane or it's three down at the

509
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:32.370
whole fucking thing.
It's just everybody merging underground.

510
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.870
It is an absolutely fucking hellish traffic

511
00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.330
and all I could picture was all the people that scammed it.

512
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.100
Living in giant houses with their own fucking helicopter flying over all of it.

513
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:52.210
Not giving a shit,
which I'm sure is not true,
but in my head,
that all make sense.

514
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.520
So I ended up missing my turn when I came out of the tunnel because,
uh,
you know,

515
00:29:57.521 --> 00:29:59.500
I'm in the tunnel,
my gps didn't work.

516
00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.530
And so you actually get on the mass pike and their signage is so bad.

517
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.400
There's actually an exit.

518
00:30:07.401 --> 00:30:11.720
You can get off work with all this signage on how to make a u turn to drive back

519
00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:16.410
to the fucking exit that they know that you missed.
But this,

520
00:30:16.411 --> 00:30:18.840
but they pocketed all the money for all this signage.

521
00:30:18.841 --> 00:30:23.040
They should've fucking had to just have one fucking sign,

522
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.290
which is the u turn to send you back in,

523
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.220
which is why everybody in Boston is so God damn funny because they do shit like

524
00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:37.210
that,
laugh about it and pocket the money and then everybody else is having an

525
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:38.710
absolute shit fit,

526
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.640
flipping out saying hilarious stuff about millennials or God knows what.

527
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.780
Um,
I think I finally figured it out where they go.

528
00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:49.690
Why are there so many fucking funny comedians that come out of Boston?

529
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.150
I would say because of the lack of signage,

530
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.320
it just keeps you in this
planes,

531
00:30:57.321 --> 00:31:01.310
trains and automobile mode 12 months out of the fucking year.

532
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.050
Everybody in Boston,
you know how they,
you know,
they know how to get to work,

533
00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.020
not because of the signs,
because they memorized it.

534
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.380
Everybody's going on fucking memory out here.

535
00:31:12.381 --> 00:31:14.360
It's certainly not the fucking signs.
All right.

536
00:31:14.361 --> 00:31:18.050
I think I've made my goddamn point.
Let me do a little La,
a little reading here.

537
00:31:18.051 --> 00:31:22.430
But anyways,
we're here at the hotel.
Everything's good.

538
00:31:22.431 --> 00:31:24.080
I actually worked out yesterday.

539
00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.820
I'm going to try to stay on my diet and like pick my spots where I'm going to be

540
00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:32.900
a,
or I'm going to be eaten bad,
but um,

541
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.990
whatever.
I don't have anything planned.

542
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.360
I just want to hang with family and friends.
It's going to be great.

543
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:41.990
And you know what's awesome about having the kid is there's no,

544
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.380
no one gives a shit about you anymore.
It's perfect.

545
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.850
You kid is the star of the show.
He just come walk in and hey bill.
Hey,

546
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:53.660
doing great.
They look at my kid.
Is My kid cute?
Oh my God,
look at those cheeks.

547
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.603
It's over.

548
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.780
You just get to stand in the background sipping a drink.

549
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.550
Hello.
By the way,
you know my wife's giving me pressure.
She's like,
pill.

550
00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:06.330
You're going to stay sober this whole fucking trip.

551
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.350
I can't go down to the hotel bar.

552
00:32:08.351 --> 00:32:11.170
I'm and I'll go down the hotel bar and I'll just get a little stuck in a fucking

553
00:32:11.171 --> 00:32:15.520
the
maybe call it a fucking soda or some shit.
What?

554
00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.850
What is that fucking drink that people order?

555
00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:20.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

556
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.510
<v 1>Can I get a,
a,
a club soda and a line.
There you go.</v>

557
00:32:22.511 --> 00:32:23.830
I'm getting it done and get it done.
Okay.

558
00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:28.810
Draftkings everybody fantasy football season is coming to a close.

559
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.210
It's time for the Tony Awards.

560
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:34.840
Everyone and the sadness is really starting to set in.

561
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.650
Um,
how about just the football season is ending a,

562
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.780
there's word for your suffering season.
Itis.

563
00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.090
But while your season long league might be done,

564
00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.010
it's not too late to draft a new team and win money doing it with one week

565
00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:54.970
fantasy football at draftkings.
At draftkings.

566
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:56.710
There are so many ways to play.

567
00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.570
Choose from public contests with huge cash prizes or private contests where you

568
00:33:01.571 --> 00:33:04.210
can compete against your friends there.

569
00:33:04.211 --> 00:33:08.500
Even they even got beginner and casual contest where you play against people of

570
00:33:08.501 --> 00:33:12.230
a similar skill level.
The best part,
you don't have to it.

571
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:16.870
I'm actually going to do this because I am ashamed at how few people's names I

572
00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:20.480
know in the league.
I just wish I could order all the,

573
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.750
a complete set of football cards for the season.

574
00:33:22.751 --> 00:33:25.180
I can look at him like flashcards when I did as a kid,

575
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:29.470
but my last time I tried to collect football cards and the two thousands it was

576
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:33.100
only adults doing it,
so they would deliberately trying to make them rare.

577
00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:34.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

578
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.000
<v 1>Anyways,
uh,</v>

579
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:40.330
the best part is you get to draft a new team each week and drafting a team is

580
00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:45.190
arguably the best part of fantasy aside from winning cache.
That is just,

581
00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.580
that is,
okay.
Sorry.
Just as Travis from Los Angeles,

582
00:33:48.581 --> 00:33:53.581
he turned a $300 entry into 1000 bucks about Gary from Houston who turned his $3

583
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.220
entry into 50 grant.
Dody you must have had a fucking 10 team.

584
00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:03.640
Huge cash prizes and bragging rights away.
Only at draftkings.

585
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.480
Why the fuck do I get credit for that?
If there's no god damn link,

586
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:12.530
I was going to go there.
Click on the microphone and add my name bar.

587
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.720
They don't even tell me to do that.
Maybe only got half the copy.
I don't know.

588
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.260
So that's it.
People,
that's all I got.
I got one read.

589
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.720
You know
I'm down to like one advertiser now.

590
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.860
Whatever I ever did this to make money I did to make my type my gigs to make

591
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:33.770
money,
so whatever,
whatever the fuck.
I'm not changing my style.
Okay.

592
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.780
These people don't like me fucking bringing up the clan every once in a while

593
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:43.730
during a fucking read.
What am I supposed to do?
Am I supposed to be like,

594
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:49.280
like that time rush decided to jump on the hip hop wagon and make a fucking rap

595
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:53.090
song?
Is that what I'm supposed to do?
How did that work out for those guys?

596
00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.190
You know,
somebody was trying to tell me that Neil pure,

597
00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.670
the reason that he retires because his body hurts so much from all those years

598
00:35:00.671 --> 00:35:04.850
of playing and that actually really made me sad.

599
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:06.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

600
00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:07.830
<v 1>And I was thinking like,
man,
that guy,
that guy,</v>

601
00:35:07.831 --> 00:35:11.970
what he needs to do is just get a fucking really good,
yeah,

602
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.750
he must have one though.
I don't know.
You got to get a jet.

603
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:19.130
I level misuse.

604
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.480
<v 0>Okay.</v>

605
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.730
<v 1>I swear to God like,</v>

606
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.900
<v 0>okay.</v>

607
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.960
<v 1>The woman that I go to right now is working on my calves,</v>

608
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.710
which had been glued up for like almost 50 years at this point.

609
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:33.460
I don't know what she's doing,
but she just takes like two fingers.
Right?

610
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.000
And it just fucking presses against my calves.
I,

611
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.280
it feels like I have a ball of Hornets.

612
00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:39.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

613
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.770
<v 1>In my fucking cat.
I wish you guys could see me in this thing.</v>

614
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:48.320
I'm just coming up off the table like a fucking mirror.
Mere a mirror.

615
00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.710
Did imagine a mere cat that's bald.
Screaming in pain.

616
00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.420
I just go,
I'll be like,
ah,
fucking Cock sucker

617
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.200
and I'm not an athlete.
We all know this.

618
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.140
<v 0>Okay,</v>

619
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.340
<v 1>I do stand up comedy.</v>

620
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:10.080
I can't have now I get why professional athletes like every week this sitting in

621
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:10.950
a tub of ice,

622
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:15.130
they're always getting fucking massage and all of that because their bodies is

623
00:36:15.131 --> 00:36:18.240
so god damn fucked up.
I feel like my body was like

624
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:24.350
how bad it got was PR,
which is why I have all of these injuries out of nowhere,

625
00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.180
you know,
and I'm now down to one injury,
my fucking rotator cuff,

626
00:36:29.181 --> 00:36:34.181
which I can't seem to get it to heal because I don't have the fucking patients.

627
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.870
And I miss playing drums too much and I just start,

628
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.410
I sit down and play and then I do something else to fuck it up again.

629
00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:44.540
I'm such an idiot.
Um,

630
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:46.170
<v 0>yeah.</v>

631
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.150
<v 1>But anyways,
I dunno.</v>

632
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.250
Maybe cause I'm a fan or whatever.

633
00:36:51.251 --> 00:36:54.670
I just hope that he finds a really good fucking,
like a Jedi level miss,

634
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:59.710
Miss Susur in a good chiropractor and he takes a couple of years off and then he

635
00:36:59.711 --> 00:37:04.650
comes back.
Uh,
but a bad,
a bad bear bag and a Dan.
Um,
anyways,

636
00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:09.400
speaking of music,
a,
uh,
a good friend of mine,
you know,

637
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.670
is there anything your friend ever a better friend than when they tell you about

638
00:37:12.671 --> 00:37:15.010
a new fucking band that you end up loving?
Um,

639
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.870
I don't know what the name of the drummer is.

640
00:37:16.871 --> 00:37:20.620
I don't know if the name of the band is the name of the guy who's actually the

641
00:37:20.621 --> 00:37:25.060
drummer.
I don't know.
But this band or this guy,
uh,

642
00:37:25.061 --> 00:37:30.061
Yussef Kamaal and the name of the album is black focus and it's spelled y u.

643
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.520
S.
S.
E.
F.
Kemal is k.
A.
M.
A.
L.

644
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:41.320
All right,
dude,
I got to tell you the drumming,

645
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.220
the music first of all and the band is incredible,

646
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.780
but the drumming on this album,

647
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.870
the best way to describe it would be like if you could somehow merge.

648
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:54.400
<v 0>Okay.</v>

649
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.910
<v 1>Like a quest love type of player with Tony Williams.</v>

650
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.313
<v 0>MMM.</v>

651
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.860
<v 1>It's like that.
Breakbeat fucking</v>

652
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.250
<v 0>okay.</v>

653
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.370
<v 1>James Brown quest love type drumming.</v>

654
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.843
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

655
00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.480
<v 1>Uh,</v>

656
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.480
with like that Tony Williams vibe even has like the black dot heads on his toms.

657
00:38:17.741 --> 00:38:21.380
It has a little bit of that sound.
It's fucking incredible.

658
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:27.270
Um,
and there's,
you got to listen to the album isn't enough.
Um,

659
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.870
I actually tweeted out a link to one to like the band playing live and the

660
00:38:31.871 --> 00:38:36.280
person,
thank God filming it was for once just on drummer from the side.

661
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.770
And this guy is like,

662
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:44.070
he's one of those guys that it's just like he's playing from is his spirit.

663
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.820
You know,
he's like in a trance when he's fucking playing these unbelievable.

664
00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.420
And uh,
I went online to see if they were going to be in the states.

665
00:38:51.421 --> 00:38:54.630
They seem to be over in Europe right now,
but uh,

666
00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:57.870
I will cancel a fucking Gig to go see that band.
That's how good they are.

667
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.540
You said [inaudible] the name of the album is black focused.

668
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.790
Check it out if you get a chance.
Uh,
what are we up to here?
Oh,
39 minutes.

669
00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:07.920
So I'll look at that.
It's Christmas.
I'm giving you some extra time here.
Uh,

670
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:12.090
Brian's,
by the way,
runs by the way,
got a two game win streak,
I believe.

671
00:39:12.091 --> 00:39:13.950
And there's six and three in the month of December.

672
00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:16.770
I finally have a chance to at least watch some of the highlights have been so

673
00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:21.771
busy and a happy 20th birthday that we McAvoy who had his first Gordie Howe hack

674
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:26.040
trick the other night.
And for those you don't watch hockey.

675
00:39:26.041 --> 00:39:30.180
A Gordie Howe hat trick is a goal and an assist and a fight.

676
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:31.860
He had his first fight.

677
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.833
<v 2>MMM.</v>

678
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.430
<v 1>I would love to interview somebody.</v>

679
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:37.403
<v 2>MMM.</v>

680
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.650
<v 1>Like a Charlie McAvoy where he's not a goon,</v>

681
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:45.210
but like I would love to interview them as far as like,

682
00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:47.730
cause he came up playing hockey.

683
00:39:47.731 --> 00:39:49.770
I don't think he played in any league where you could fight.

684
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.960
So this was his first and he came right straight from bu last year in like march

685
00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.470
or April and had an immediate impact.
Um,
so I think I'm,

686
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.990
I'm wondering if this was his first hockey fight period and like what is going

687
00:40:03.991 --> 00:40:07.350
through your head when you go to drop the gloves?
Like,

688
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.490
and you're fighting on in any each.
I love,
I mean,

689
00:40:11.491 --> 00:40:15.540
fighting somebody alone is brutal now because someone's going to have their cell

690
00:40:15.541 --> 00:40:16.141
phone camera,

691
00:40:16.141 --> 00:40:19.440
but to actually do it on television and it takes a lot of fucking balls.

692
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.123
<v 2>MMM.</v>

693
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:26.010
<v 1>I always wondered like what's going through their head and fighting on skates.</v>

694
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.730
It's the only way to learn how to do it is to do it.
It's like stand up comedy.

695
00:40:29.731 --> 00:40:33.210
Like you could stand in your room and fucking rehearse in front of a mirror,

696
00:40:33.211 --> 00:40:36.100
but it's,
it's all out the window.
The second you get on stage,

697
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:40.480
it's like guitar where you could practice,
you know,

698
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.470
and rehearse with the band and all of that shit.

699
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.020
Even then you're just going to be that extra level of nervousness because now

700
00:40:45.021 --> 00:40:45.980
people are watching you.

701
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.723
<v 2>MMM.</v>

702
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.150
<v 1>That's my favorite thing about all of that stuff.
Like</v>

703
00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:53.423
<v 2>mmm.</v>

704
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.080
<v 1>Doing any sort of acting in front of a crowd and all of that is just our plain,</v>

705
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.930
you know,
rehearsing with the band and then playing in front of them.

706
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:07.180
I always loved that the rush of,
you know,

707
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:11.710
when you look at each other before you start,
is that like,
oh,
here it is.

708
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:17.020
All of that work.
Now here it is,
is we're going to pull this off.

709
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.300
Are we going to shit the bed or whatever?

710
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.090
And there's always that part that's the difficult part.

711
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:24.160
And you know where you got like a lot of lines or like this,

712
00:41:24.161 --> 00:41:25.300
some sort of drum fill.

713
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.780
And when you get on the other side of it and you hopefully pulled it off,

714
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:32.380
you're like,
oh,
it's all downhill.
And then you relax and then you fuck up.

715
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.210
I don't mean relaxed in a good way.
I should probably say loose focus.
Um,

716
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.080
it,
by the way,
that's something that I've been working on,
um,
with my,

717
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.560
my drumming is,
my teacher has been telling me forever.
He,

718
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:54.610
he's just basically to sum up what he says is 15 minutes a day of focused

719
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.000
practice.
See if I remember this,

720
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:03.950
15 minutes a day of focused practice is better than four hours of add plank,

721
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:08.550
which is what I would do.
Good Times,
bad times for a minute.
Oh,
uh,

722
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.080
s a tower power at Squibb cakes.
So we work on that for fucking two minutes.

723
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.200
Let me do this,
and blah,
blah,
blah.
And you just all over the fucking map.

724
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:20.240
It'd be literally like if you were trying to learn to speak another language and

725
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.300
rather than just trying to learn a phrase or two a day and then sticking with

726
00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:26.871
that for a week,

727
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:31.220
so it becomes part of something that you could just pull up immediately as you

728
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:36.221
think you would try to learn like 50 words a day and then the next day do 50

729
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:37.574
different words.

730
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.373
<v 2>MMM.</v>

731
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.800
<v 1>So I've really been working on,
on that and um,</v>

732
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:51.150
and all I've been doing is just like a doubles working on just a double stroke

733
00:42:52.421 --> 00:42:53.770
roll with accents.

734
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.250
And I've been working on that since fucking November and all of a sudden

735
00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.260
something clicked and
I,

736
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.330
I'm
finally so fucking excited that,
uh,

737
00:43:07.331 --> 00:43:12.140
that I've been able to do that.
So,
so if you're out there,

738
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.120
man,
woman,
transgendered,
person,
whatever drummer you are,

739
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.210
uh,
you know,

740
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.410
most creative people have massive levels of fucking add.

741
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.470
Um,
and it's not because you're stupid,
it's not because you lack focus.
He's just,

742
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:34.160
you have a very creative brain and you think of something which makes you think

743
00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:37.040
of the next idea and the next idea and the next idea.

744
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.020
And practicing is not creating.
It's working on an idea that you have,

745
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.320
if that makes sense.
If you just work on that.

746
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.720
And I in my 15 minutes,
like I'll be playing doubles,
right?

747
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.460
And then all of a sudden it'd be like,
oh,

748
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:55.940
let's throw some paradiddles and a big bill bill back to the doubles.

749
00:43:55.941 --> 00:43:59.990
He just had to keep like hitting the reset button.

750
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.970
And,
um,
that alone,

751
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.880
like I had to practice out of focus as fucked up as that sounds.
But you know,

752
00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:13.110
if you work on it a little bit every day,
um,
you know,

753
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:17.800
cause I figure if I could fucking do it to my lack of musical ability,

754
00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:19.660
if musicians who listened to this,

755
00:44:19.661 --> 00:44:24.100
if you actually fucking try that on any instrument or whatever I'm telling you,

756
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:28.510
um,
you'll start to see results.

757
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.700
It's fucking awesome that you can apply the plank.
It's fucking amazing.

758
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:35.840
So anyways,
um,
the Celtics were the Bra,

759
00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.310
a bronze today have Winnipeg,

760
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:43.311
and then on Saturday they have the red wings and then the Celtics have the bowls

761
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:46.980
that night.
All right.
It back in the day before I was a dad,

762
00:44:46.981 --> 00:44:50.520
I would have gone to both games a little Bingo,
Bangor.

763
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.790
And I carry my buzz from the Bruins game writing to the Celtics.

764
00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.580
<v 2>Um,
but,
uh,</v>

765
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.500
<v 1>I'm a dad now,
so I can't fucking do that.
So,
which means I'll watch the game,</v>

766
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:03.850
but I am going,
I'm going to the Celtics bowls.
I am doing that.

767
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.443
<v 2>MMM.</v>

768
00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.340
<v 1>Taking a couple of family members there for a,</v>

769
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:12.950
a little Christmas celebration there.
I know it's just the bowls,

770
00:45:12.951 --> 00:45:15.650
but the next time they play is on Christmas Day and that's not going to work
out.

771
00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:20.330
All right.
My stomach's growling here.
I got to go get somebody.
All right.
Uh,

772
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:25.210
merry Christmas to everybody.
Happy Hanukkah.
Happy Kwanzaa.
Happy.
Uh,

773
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.940
I don't celebrate the holidays to you.
Whatever it is.
Hey,
you made it.

774
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:33.710
You made it through 2017,
2018 is going to be even better for you.
All right?
Uh,

775
00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.910
go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.
You can't.

776
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.240
And I will talk to you on Monday,

777
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:43.250
hopefully about another Patriot victory over the buffalo bills.
All right.

778
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.273
See you.

779
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:57.703
<v 6>Okay,</v>

780
00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:01.993
<v 7>sweet.</v>

781
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.843
<v 8>Yes.</v>

782
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:00.850
<v 7>Going</v>

783
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.320
<v 3>on.
It's Belper and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

784
00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:08.610
December 21st,
2000.
[inaudible] what's going on?

785
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:13.390
How the hell are you?
How are you last week?
Did you miss me?
Um,

786
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.240
I actually was,
what's surprising?
Monday emails.

787
00:47:15.241 --> 00:47:18.720
I got what people like doing what happens?
You'll fucking die.

788
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.750
She's making sure you're all right.
You know,

789
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:27.300
fucking Brittany Murphy died,
you know?
Did you die?

790
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.450
I felt really bad about that.
You know,
even though I never saw any of her movies,

791
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:34.840
but you know,
if I felt as bad as you feel when somebody you don't know dies,

792
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.200
you know,
I hate when people try to get,
like,

793
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.950
when they get overly sad about somebody famous dying because you know,

794
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:45.940
you never met him and then they try to use it as an excuse to get out of
working.

795
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.530
No,
you don't understand.
I used to watch clueless with my mother.

796
00:47:50.531 --> 00:47:55.480
We watched it like every day.
I just,
I can't function right now.
Shut up.

797
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.680
You fucking Lazy Twat go in there and do your end of the year.

798
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.520
Bullshit so we can get on with the fucking Christmas party.

799
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:10.600
You know,
you didn't know her.
Okay.
You didn't know her.

800
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.430
I didn't know it.
Nobody knows her.
Well,
people know are,
but nobody we know.

801
00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:20.040
You fucking idiot.
Just do your fucking job.
Um hmm.

802
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.660
Wow.
Little intense there.
Basically.

803
00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:26.860
I didn't do a special last week because,
um,

804
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:31.630
I was under the weather and you can tell I'm still getting over it.
I have the,

805
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:34.090
uh,
and I think I have the swine flu.

806
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.340
You know,
a little of that little that going on.
I didn't say to Christmas cookie.

807
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.020
I made a Christmas cookie.
Did you make a Christmas cookie of fucking him fag?

808
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:47.860
Yes I did.

809
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.140
I keep the holiday traditions alive in my house.
You know,

810
00:48:53.141 --> 00:48:55.210
I don't go home for the holidays anymore.
And you know what?

811
00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:56.740
I bet a lot of you are wishing you don't.

812
00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.840
If you're stuck in an airport and if you are,

813
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.800
I feel for you because I've been there and what you're going through right now

814
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:07.330
is the exact fucking reason that I don't go home for the holidays other than the

815
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:12.280
fact I had to get on with my life here.
Um,
is I'm telling you,

816
00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:17.281
I know you go anywhere where it even remotes remotely has a snowflake and the

817
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:19.000
day you're going to travel,

818
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.010
God knows there's going to be four inches of fucking snow and the weathermen are

819
00:49:24.011 --> 00:49:28.420
going to act like it's going to be 40 feet of snow.
You know,

820
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.140
that's one thing I,

821
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:34.140
I've noticed in my lifetime where somehow weather has become like an action

822
00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:41.200
movie,
you know,
and the cats,
my girlfriend leaving,
closing this squeaky door,

823
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:46.480
no concern for the recording.
Um,

824
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.020
you know,
brunch.
So he could the guy,
they're going to do what they want to do,

825
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.430
you know?
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,
but back in the day,

826
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:58.090
there was four inches of snow.
That was it.
It was,

827
00:49:58.091 --> 00:50:03.050
it's going to snow on Thursday.
It wasn't like,
oh my God,

828
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.210
it's nothing new.
They always fucking scare the shit out of old people,
right?

829
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:10.090
And they fucking,
you know,
those idiots.

830
00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.710
It's like four inches of snow and people going down to the supermarket like

831
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:19.210
buying provisions,
you know,
gun powder and bread and shit.
It's like,

832
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:23.620
it's four inches of fucking snow.
You know,

833
00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:26.890
what is the worst case scenario?
A scenario,
right?
What,
what is it?

834
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.570
Four inches of snow,
even for a little old lady is up to your ankles,

835
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:38.270
okay?
If you have a problem,
people can get to you.
You know,

836
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.550
even if there was a foot of snow,
which is a lot of fucking snow,
okay?

837
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.490
And let's just say you didn't have any food,

838
00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:52.220
you can still just take a handful of fucking snow,
stick it in the glass,

839
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:53.420
let it melt,

840
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.560
and then let it cool down so you don't get a fucking snow cone headache.

841
00:50:57.561 --> 00:51:01.370
And then you have water and you can live for a long time on just water.

842
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:05.150
It's only a foot of snow.
These fucking assholes.

843
00:51:05.151 --> 00:51:08.230
They scare the shit out of people.
So,
uh,

844
00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:11.390
I don't know what this has to do with people being stranding and stranded in an

845
00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:14.870
airport.
All I can say is I'm so site,
I'm not one of those people.

846
00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:20.180
Um,
but anyways,
getting back to me,
um,

847
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.730
last week I did my,
uh,
my latest standup special,
uh,

848
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.030
let it go and I did it at the a,
the Fillmore in San Francisco,

849
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:32.120
the original Fillmore.
And right now you should be going,
well,

850
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:35.510
what do you mean he original film?
What does that me,
uh,

851
00:51:35.511 --> 00:51:38.480
I thought that that was the Fillmore west,
but evidently it isn't.

852
00:51:38.481 --> 00:51:42.290
It's the Fillmore auditorium where I think they were there from like,
I dunno,

853
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:47.291
65 to 68 and then 68 they moved down to market street and that became the

854
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:48.440
Fillmore West.

855
00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:51.470
That's where as Zeppelin and I think the WHO and all those guys played.

856
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.580
So it was a little disappointed when I played the Fillmore and realized that

857
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:57.320
when I went into the green room bathroom,

858
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:00.620
I wasn't actually urinating in a place where John Bonham took a shit.

859
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.060
I was a little disappointed with that.
But,
um,

860
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.010
my girlfriend is wearing some sort of fervor vest.

861
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:15.860
What is that?
What Old Lady died?

862
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.400
And then you bought that?
Is that like a state jury?
Except it's a vest.

863
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:25.220
Does that make any sense?
You're your little Cruella Deville Ensemble.

864
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.300
You're dressed very sensibly.
I can see why he put it on.

865
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.780
Then you put it on the little first thing to add a little little edge to you.

866
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:38.360
So people be like,
you know,
you didn't want to be plain Jane during the holidays.

867
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.900
No,
I hate those fucking shoes with a passion.

868
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.830
If you always,
if you ever,
if you are those shoes on the first date,

869
00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:53.700
there never would have met a second day.
Rarely yet you think you think of that.

870
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:57.320
Those things are fucking,
she's got these Bruce shut up.

871
00:52:57.321 --> 00:53:01.400
She's got these Bruce Lee Karate fucking flats.

872
00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:07.810
They're horrible.
They're ballet flats.
Well,

873
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.720
what did that prove?

874
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:18.380
All right,
get out of here.
Um,
it doesn't,

875
00:53:18.381 --> 00:53:20.930
everybody just happened.
You know,
you girlfriend has that pair of shoes.

876
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:25.000
You just fucking hate her comfortable shoes.
These are thought I like,

877
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:30.050
they're comfortable,
you know,
I swear to God she left.

878
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:35.060
You know,
it's fucking unbelievable is,
you know what's funny is when you hook up,

879
00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:39.490
you have a hook up with a short girl,
you know,
and you see her in a car,

880
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:43.840
you see her in the club,
right?
And your dad sin,

881
00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:48.250
right.
Don't worry,
I'm going to get to Jersey shore.
Uh,

882
00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.460
and you got like the fall.
Let's talk about that right now.

883
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.390
Let's talk about that little sneaky girl.
Okay,

884
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.070
let's just,

885
00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:01.480
let's just say she didn't have fucking triple f titties.

886
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:05.860
Let's just say she didn't have those and she was more proportioned.
Um,

887
00:54:05.861 --> 00:54:08.560
I'm actually convinced that she actually doesn't have a torso.

888
00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:13.350
She just has ass and titties and the ass or is at the same level as,

889
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:17.050
as her titties.
Um,
whenever you don't,
the short girls,

890
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.340
and they were like those four inch fucking heels and it just makes them,

891
00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:25.640
their legs look unbelievable.
And,
you know,
I swear to God,

892
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.310
you have to bang them in those shoes because when they,

893
00:54:28.311 --> 00:54:31.880
you get them out of the shoes,
you just,
it's like

894
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.230
they become like this little dwarf all of a sudden,

895
00:54:36.231 --> 00:54:39.410
and they're walking around and they have that little thong on and you just,

896
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.070
it just,
it's fucking weird,
you know?

897
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:45.740
So what I'm saying is,
is,
you know,

898
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:49.310
you meet a girl and you'd go out with them and what are they dress up and then

899
00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:51.650
they're looking at their shoes.
Okay.
And then like,

900
00:54:51.651 --> 00:54:55.030
which shoes am I going to wear?
I got to look sexy,
but I,

901
00:54:55.031 --> 00:54:59.180
I can't make it look like,
you know,
every time I see a dick,

902
00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:03.290
I'm diving on it like a war hero of dives on a fucking live grenade.
You know,

903
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.320
I,
ah,

904
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.300
that's a fucking great image.
Just dive in on a fucking cock.

905
00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:18.800
Oh,
you filthy horse.
So they leave those shoes,
they leave those,

906
00:55:18.801 --> 00:55:23.290
I'm getting over my boyfriend shoes at home.
Right.
Um,

907
00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:28.050
that Kim could,
they leave those at home and that,
but they definitely,

908
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.160
you know,
they definitely sex the fucking thing.
I'm so whatever.

909
00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.990
Then they get you,
you know,
you fall for him,
whatever.

910
00:55:32.991 --> 00:55:36.710
Then you were in a relationship and then there's that one fucking day where they

911
00:55:36.711 --> 00:55:41.450
feel comfortable enough to wear their little comfortable shoes and they're just,

912
00:55:41.451 --> 00:55:41.960
you know,

913
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.960
toes and fucking and heal are just on the same logistic flats.

914
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:52.721
They were their fucking flats and that little stretch pants and all of a sudden

915
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:57.710
it's like you're walking around with like this soccer mom and it's like,

916
00:55:57.711 --> 00:56:02.210
what happened to the fucking Hottie,
you know,
that I saw at work,

917
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.200
right.
And it work.
Listen to me,
I sound like Seinfeld

918
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.540
<v 9>deal with your comfortable shoes.</v>

919
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.140
Why aren't you,

920
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.710
<v 3>um,
yeah,
so those are hers.</v>

921
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.280
She wears ballet flats and I swear to God,
you know,

922
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.260
I know I bring up the leg sweep a lot,
but every time I see him I just,
you know,

923
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:28.510
you ever been like in a store with your girlfriend and she's just annoying you

924
00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:31.360
and you just start having this like this fantasy of like,

925
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:36.550
what if I just walked away,
right?
Like,

926
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:39.400
seriously.
What if I just walked away?

927
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:43.320
Like for good,
like if it was,
what are we,

928
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:47.530
what it was that easy to get out of a fucking relationship,
you know,

929
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:52.270
there wasn't a talk that wasn't like the whole,
yeah.
You know,
I'm just not you.

930
00:56:52.271 --> 00:56:55.880
It's me.
I'm just,
I'm not happy.
I'm not happy.
And,
uh,

931
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.460
it's not fair for you,

932
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:01.360
for me to still be in this thing when you should be out there and you should be

933
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:03.730
with a guy who,
who,
you know,

934
00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:07.090
is going to give you all those emotional things that I can't,

935
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:11.440
and I don't know why it is,
but I need to go figure it out.
And,
um,

936
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:14.260
just very painful for me to do.

937
00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:19.410
I have a lot of guilt and a law even feeling this way,

938
00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.920
uh,
for the last three minutes.
You know,
you can't,
you can never say like,

939
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:26.980
I probably since the second date,
but you know,
you were fucking me.
Good.

940
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:31.780
So I stuck around and here it is eight months later and uh,

941
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:36.460
I've always hated this couch,
so
sorry,
going to take a drink there.

942
00:57:36.461 --> 00:57:38.890
You don't want to be great for you did.
You're just,
you just fucking walk away.

943
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.950
I've always been envious of those people who like abandoned their families.

944
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.470
Not that they do that,
that's like a terrible thing to do,

945
00:57:44.471 --> 00:57:48.790
but like I want to feel that euphoria at some point in my life.

946
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:53.740
Can you imagine how fucking unhappy you are as a man?

947
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:59.310
That you have a wife and children and you are so miserable that you're actually

948
00:58:02.561 --> 00:58:07.120
contemplating just walking away from it all,
you know?
Okay,

949
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:10.630
but it's like a fantasy.
You're not going to,
y'all got can.
I got kids.

950
00:58:10.631 --> 00:58:13.630
I can't fucking do that.
I can't be that fucking piece of shit.

951
00:58:13.631 --> 00:58:16.900
Like in a blues song,
he'd go out to get cigarettes and he never come back again.

952
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:20.620
But the guys who actually fucking do it,
I know there's a loneliness.

953
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:21.700
I know there's a guilt,

954
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:27.480
but that feeling right as you're standing in the doorway to your kitchen on the

955
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:30.880
way to your back door,
you know,

956
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:35.410
and she's just sitting there giving you shit or whatever the fuck it is that

957
00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.360
she's just,
she's eaten that English muffin.

958
00:58:37.361 --> 00:58:41.920
The way she eats it and the side of her fucking temples are going in and out and

959
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:45.940
you just can't stand it.
She's doing that thing the way she cleared her throat.

960
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:51.710
Right?
And you're like,
just going like,
hey honey,
I'm,

961
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.010
I'm going to go return this video.
Okay.

962
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.950
[inaudible] hey man,
me.

963
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.880
And you're like,
absolutely.
You know,

964
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.670
and then you get in the car,

965
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:14.260
you already got your fucking bag of clothes in there or some shit.

966
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:20.130
I mean,
it's your drive it out the door.
I mean,
you just must be doing like,

967
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:23.170
what song do you fucking listen to?
What is the soundtrack?

968
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.690
Has Anybody ever abandoned a family?
Any listeners?

969
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:31.720
What Song were you listening to on your iPod when you turn the fucking corner?

970
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:33.710
You know,

971
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:37.190
you got to feel like Tim Robbins when he comes up out of that fucking sewer

972
00:59:37.191 --> 00:59:38.810
water.
You know,

973
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.960
and I'm sure you have your fantasy that you're going to be sitting there on a

974
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:45.590
beach building a boat,
you know,

975
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:50.120
with some Tan tidied Hati that you met on fucking Facebook.
Right?

976
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:53.240
And just when you think she's going to find you and you're going to have to pay

977
00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:55.010
child support,
you look up,
who is it?

978
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:59.990
It's fucking Morgan Freeman and a little reservoir dogs sue with a fucking bing

979
00:59:59.991 --> 01:00:04.430
Crosby hat.
Right?
I know that's what you fantasize about.

980
01:00:04.431 --> 01:00:07.190
But then he ended up in a fucking motel six.
We won't go there,

981
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:11.690
but I would love to feel that fucking that euphoria.

982
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:14.503
You know,

983
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:18.770
I felt that a few times when I've skipped school that will be driving on the way

984
01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:20.900
to school and all of a sudden I just think,
you know what?

985
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:25.220
I don't feel like going today.
And I would keep going and just with ag,

986
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:29.000
no power whatsoever that I could control my emotions.

987
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:32.540
I would just break into an ear to ear grin and I would,

988
01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:37.310
I have just got to go to a fucking movie,
you know,
I did.
I used to it by myself.

989
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:41.720
I'd skip school by myself.
I came in with the fuck I do,
I drive around.

990
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.570
I would drive out to fucking,
uh,

991
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.250
I go look at the fuck and this is what a nerd I was.

992
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.780
I go out and I go look at Sullivan Stadium with a patriots used to play.

993
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.870
I just go look at it,
you know,
go out,

994
01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.560
go get a fucking breakfast at like the,

995
01:00:57.561 --> 01:01:01.130
I hop just thinking I'd be in math class right now.

996
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:07.450
I mean pancakes and I should be listening to some guy talking about first

997
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:11.490
outside,
inside.
Last,
right.
I even,

998
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:14.270
how the fuck I got on this subject when you're talking about shoes,

999
01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:17.240
we were talking about shoe.
So anyways,
you probably wondering,
Bill,

1000
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:21.170
how did the taping go?
Well if he can't hear the fucking joy in my voice,

1001
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:26.660
I can't help you.
It was awesome.
The first show when fucking great.

1002
01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:28.550
And then the second show was just,

1003
01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:32.390
it was over the top and I'm like I said,

1004
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:36.440
it was at the Fillmore,
absolutely legendary place.
They had all these,

1005
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:41.030
they have all the posters from all the bands that have played there.
You know,

1006
01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.330
recently they have that room and then they have the classic room where they had

1007
01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:49.331
literally had posters like a pink Floyd poster that said it said from England,

1008
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:52.820
Pink Floyd.
It just gave me chills to read it.

1009
01:01:52.821 --> 01:01:56.900
Like they were like pink Floyd was that knew that they needed some sweet,

1010
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.360
they needed like a hook to get people to go see him.

1011
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.710
And the hook was that they were from England,
you know,
cause the whole,
you know,

1012
01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:08.090
the Beatles,
the rolling stones at that point.
And I think,
I think the,

1013
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:10.670
who had already been here at by that point,
I dunno why,
but like,
you know,

1014
01:02:10.671 --> 01:02:14.690
the whole British invasion that happened.
So they had to s you know,

1015
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:19.350
pink fucking Floyd from England and from England guys,

1016
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:22.470
I think you ought to give him a chance.
They called Pink Floyd.
I know.

1017
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:23.430
It's a weird name.

1018
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.820
They had all those kinds of posts as they had a poster there for Lenny Bruce.

1019
01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:31.420
I found out he did his last performances were right there.
And um,

1020
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:37.590
it just gave me goosebumps and uh,
it was great.
The first show,

1021
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.940
the first show went great.

1022
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:43.530
I was sweating a little bit because I had taken this fucking dayquil and the

1023
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:47.160
combination of that and the spotlight.
So it got to the point about,
you know,

1024
01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:51.750
two thirds of the way through my set,
you know,
you know,

1025
01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:56.670
I had to fucking towel myself off like I was playing racket ball.
So,

1026
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:59.860
uh,
yeah,
anything past that I'm not going to use that,
you know,

1027
01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.670
I'm not going to be able to,
cause the second one went,
went off without a hitch.

1028
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:06.120
I didn't take any cold medication and I just,
you know,

1029
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:07.770
I already knew I had a great taping.

1030
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.820
And then so then the second one I just went off and a,

1031
01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:16.050
I literally felt like I was standing in a comedy club and I was going through 10

1032
01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:20.310
to 15 minute chunks where I wasn't even aware.

1033
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.390
I wasn't even thinking that I was taping a special,
you know,

1034
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.530
I definitely knew I was,
but I w I wasn't like thinking about that.

1035
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:31.650
There were cameras there.
I was just focusing on what I was saying.

1036
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.190
I kind of learned this trick out of trick my head in to doing that,

1037
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.100
which is basically I improv a little bit upfront,

1038
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:41.700
which saps me into the presence,
the presence,
you know,

1039
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.860
as opposed to me and in robot mode.
So when,
anyways,
it was fucking unbelievable.

1040
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:51.540
They made me a poster so my poster was actually going to be hanging there.

1041
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.120
I don't know how long they'll hang it there because uh,
you know,

1042
01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:58.290
it's one of those deals they revolve them around and who the fuck am I?

1043
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:02.070
But for a moment it's going to be hang in there.
Um,

1044
01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:03.880
and uh,
I dunno,

1045
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.260
my parents came out and they stuck out all my friends and family and this,

1046
01:04:07.261 --> 01:04:10.570
this VIP,
um,
you know,
like,

1047
01:04:10.571 --> 01:04:12.570
like you don't like the old guys on the muppets.

1048
01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.000
It was something like that in the back of the room and the whole time we're just

1049
01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:15.834
sticking there.

1050
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.580
Like Bill Graham probably stood there the first time he watched Jimmy Hendrix.

1051
01:04:19.581 --> 01:04:24.120
It was,
it was fucking unbelievable.
It was unbelievable.
And,

1052
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:28.950
um,
I actually,
I don't know.
I was,

1053
01:04:28.951 --> 01:04:33.630
I was be on site at the end of it and,
uh,
and then the second and ended,

1054
01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.030
I finally fucking relaxed a little bit.

1055
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:39.510
And then that's when the sickness that had been trying to get me just completely

1056
01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:42.390
took over.
But I didn't give a fuck at that point.

1057
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:45.990
And I battled it with some alcohol,
but whatever.

1058
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:50.590
I want to thank everybody who came out to,
uh,
my,

1059
01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.440
my tapings.
It was,
it's something that I will never ever forget,
um,

1060
01:04:55.500 --> 01:05:00.500
to perform in a venue that legendary was very humbling and I'm so psyched that I

1061
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:03.480
had,
um,
I dunno,
I want to say,

1062
01:05:03.481 --> 01:05:07.140
I think I had the best performance I've had for a TV taping up to this point in

1063
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:11.310
my career.
And,
uh,
it was awesome.
And I want to thank everybody who went,

1064
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:16.670
including this guy who sent me an email after the,

1065
01:05:16.801 --> 01:05:21.370
uh,
after the taping a under the title of lack luster.

1066
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.590
And this guy has earned douche bag of the week.
Yes.
Everybody,

1067
01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.030
um,
this is one of these things where you just can't please everybody.

1068
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.720
And you know what kind of a content we would send somebody an email like this,

1069
01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.460
you know,
lack luster.
This is the beauty of the Internet that I,

1070
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:45.640
that I really find.
I think the Internet is fucking hilarious.

1071
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.780
How just any random shithead,
you know,

1072
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.380
I don't know if it's just me cause I pretty much read all my emails,
but like,

1073
01:05:53.381 --> 01:05:55.810
you know,
if you've got something bad to tell me,
there's,
you know,

1074
01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:59.650
you got a 90% chance,
I'm going to fucking read it.
Um,

1075
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.870
I just think that's funny because back in the day,
you know,

1076
01:06:01.871 --> 01:06:03.820
I used to watch TV and I'd be watching people go,

1077
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:06.760
this guy's and fucking funny and there's this guy sucks.

1078
01:06:06.761 --> 01:06:09.100
Why does he keep doing movies?
But I,

1079
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:12.040
but it was just to the TV or to the guy sitting next to me.

1080
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:15.730
I couldn't actually get it to the person.
So,
uh,
you know,

1081
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.230
how about that for technology?
So this is what the guy writes.
He writes belt.

1082
01:06:20.231 --> 01:06:24.400
To be honest,
I was disappointed at your film.
More show.
Um,

1083
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.190
I am a big fan,
but I am also a realist.

1084
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.950
I don't even know what that means.

1085
01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:34.000
I guess that means he was expecting something big but I didn't deliver and I

1086
01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:37.810
have to be honest with you,
bill,
you didn't deliver.
I mean what a cunt,
right?

1087
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:40.330
He goes,
first off,
I was very disappointing,

1088
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:45.340
very disappointed at the recording of audience,
applause and laughter.

1089
01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.620
I thought it was the opening guys last bit.
I was the asshole that booed.

1090
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.470
Laughter and applause tracks are weak.

1091
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:57.580
What he's saying is right before they brought me on the opening act said,

1092
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.360
okay,
we need you guys to do us a favor.
Okay,

1093
01:07:01.361 --> 01:07:04.810
I'm going to count to three and a.
When I count to three,

1094
01:07:04.811 --> 01:07:06.340
I want you guys just everybody laugh.

1095
01:07:06.341 --> 01:07:09.490
Like you just heard something that was kind of funny and they one,
two,

1096
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:13.240
three in the crowds.
Like Ah,
whatever.
Right.
And then,
okay,
that was great.

1097
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.021
That was great.
All right.

1098
01:07:14.021 --> 01:07:16.950
Now this time I want you to laugh a little bit more like it like deck deck.

1099
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.460
That was that was really funny and they laugh a little bit louder and then they

1100
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:22.241
go,
okay,
that was great.

1101
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:26.290
Now the third time I want you guys to laugh like this is the funniest thing

1102
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:29.980
you've ever heard.
One,
two,
three and everybody,
why breeze going near?
It's crazy.

1103
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.790
So this guy booze and he says,
you know,

1104
01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.620
audience applause,
tracks and laughter a week.
You know,

1105
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:45.070
sir,
this is why you are a Douche bag of the week because what you did was you

1106
01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:50.071
assumed that we were recording those in an effort just in case I bombed that.

1107
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:52.331
We were good.

1108
01:07:52.331 --> 01:07:57.331
Then going to use those to drop in laughter but we were actually doing sir was

1109
01:07:58.721 --> 01:08:03.721
we were testing the levels of the audience and we wanted to make sure that we

1110
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:09.790
were going to be able to capture anything that the audience did that if they

1111
01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:13.480
found something mildly funny that the mix would be up enough where they would

1112
01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:18.481
pick it up but they wouldn't be up so much debt if people went crazy.

1113
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.220
What happens is as if oh fit like overloads.

1114
01:08:22.221 --> 01:08:23.540
I don't know what the technical thing is.

1115
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:27.200
The microphone shuts off basically when it red lines,

1116
01:08:27.201 --> 01:08:30.440
it's almost like a car or something.
Like it seizes up.
It just stops.

1117
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.520
So what you have to do before you go out there and she have to make sure that

1118
01:08:34.521 --> 01:08:38.090
you have your mix at the right level and you do it with every crowd.

1119
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:40.850
Cause every crowd is different.
It's a different group of people.

1120
01:08:40.851 --> 01:08:41.960
There's a different energy.

1121
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:47.060
And what you're trying to do is you got to capture that live sound of the room.

1122
01:08:47.061 --> 01:08:48.680
So what we were doing there,
sir,

1123
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:53.150
was we were basically doing an audience,
um,

1124
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.890
like a sound check.
Like,
you know,
when the artist comes out,

1125
01:08:57.891 --> 01:09:01.670
he's like [inaudible] test one,
two,
hey,

1126
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.240
hey Yo,
you know,
I'll let shit that they do.

1127
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:09.080
And what you're supposed to do is also be,
you know,
bringing your voice out loud,

1128
01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:12.020
going away from the Mike Elizabeth,
there's a way to do it or whatever.

1129
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:16.250
They were basically doing that for you because they had already done a sound

1130
01:09:16.251 --> 01:09:20.210
check for me.
So that's what they were doing.
You fucking moron.

1131
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:24.500
All right.
And I understand that you're not in this business,

1132
01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:27.440
so you should know what that is.
But you know,

1133
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:30.040
there was plenty of people standing around from the crew that you could have

1134
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:33.800
asked before you left before you went on Facebook and fucking trash me.

1135
01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:38.150
Like,
um,
like,
um,
I'm trying to get,
you know,

1136
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:42.410
that would be almost like,
like I lip sync to my act that,

1137
01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.570
so that's not what was happening,
sir.
All right.

1138
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:49.410
You fucking douchebag cheesy.
I maybe,
maybe it's on us.
Next special.

1139
01:09:49.411 --> 01:09:51.860
I'm going to make sure the opener says,
look,
and we're not going to use these.

1140
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:55.640
What we're doing is we're basically doing a soundcheck and plus if this guy had

1141
01:09:55.641 --> 01:09:56.331
half a brain,

1142
01:09:56.331 --> 01:09:59.990
he would have listened to the laughter because most people were not laughing.

1143
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.980
What they would do was they would go,
Ooh,
you know,

1144
01:10:03.981 --> 01:10:08.660
and the funniest thing ever there was screaming so it didn't,

1145
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.420
the audio wouldn't have sounded like I told a joke or what.

1146
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:15.920
It sounded like some drunk jumped up on stage and was about to take his dick
out.

1147
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.300
That's what the crowd's son likes.

1148
01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:22.220
I always actually backstage laughing when I was listening to it.
Um,

1149
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:26.180
so there you go,
sir.
That's,
that's what was going on.

1150
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:28.990
And then he also goes on to say that he just recently hit,

1151
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:33.980
he saw my last show at the punchline and that he was disappointed that when he

1152
01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:37.400
went to go to the DVD recording that he barely heard any new material.

1153
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:42.170
So he was basically mad that he saw me getting ready for my special.

1154
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.870
And then when he went to go see my special,

1155
01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:48.110
that the jokes that I was working on during the night that he saw me,

1156
01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:49.850
we're the same jokes.

1157
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:54.710
This guy is such a fucking moron on so many levels.

1158
01:10:54.711 --> 01:10:59.180
It's like you can't go out and wing a special,
sir.
You can't do it.

1159
01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:00.440
Comics have tried it.

1160
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:05.090
I've seen comics go out with a legal pad and some ideas written down there and

1161
01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:07.550
you'll have moments where you're riffing and it's going great,

1162
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:11.460
but there's a reason why you don't do that.
All right?

1163
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:15.840
You've got to have the act okay to Improv.

1164
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.950
Even like these fucking Improv people who are in these improv groups and they

1165
01:11:19.951 --> 01:11:22.260
try to act like the whole fucking thing they do.
Well,

1166
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:26.040
it's all off the top of their head.
The fucking audience suggest Shit,
you know?

1167
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:29.820
And it's really just off the top of your head the first fucking time you do it

1168
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.280
because the more you do those here,

1169
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:32.940
cause I used to watch us in Prague group every week,

1170
01:11:32.941 --> 01:11:35.010
they used to come down to the laugh factory.
The first time I saw I was like,

1171
01:11:35.011 --> 01:11:36.030
wow man,
that's fucking amazing.

1172
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.940
But you start watching it after awhile and you're like,

1173
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:42.360
oh that guy always does this.
This person always does that.

1174
01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.520
And you know,
and then there's also repeat suggestions.

1175
01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:50.700
Give me a job and it's a job you've heard before.
You know,

1176
01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:53.550
I'm not shitting on those guys,
but you know,
it's one of those deals.

1177
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:56.520
So that's the deal,
sir.

1178
01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:01.140
That's why you heard the same material and that's why you heard,
uh,

1179
01:12:01.141 --> 01:12:05.430
and that's why we were doing the applause tracks.
Okay.
So I am not a,

1180
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.270
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you do.
But you know,

1181
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.230
it's really fucking annoying that you deci that,
you know,

1182
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:16.410
to have to read a fucking email like that and one of the best nights of my

1183
01:12:16.411 --> 01:12:19.530
fucking career to have put,
I mean that's,
that's power for the fucking course.

1184
01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:22.230
What are you going to do?
You know,
what are you going to fucking do?

1185
01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:25.080
So there you go.
This douche bag of the week.
I'm trying to do more of these,
uh,

1186
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.040
my old little standards here,
whatever you want to call them,

1187
01:12:28.041 --> 01:12:31.770
a different topics here because somebody actually sent me an email telling any

1188
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:35.190
know you'd never do again to your topics anymore.
And uh,

1189
01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:39.120
I think the person was right.
So I'm trying to,
uh,
to get back to that shit.

1190
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.270
So,
uh,
let's read a couple more emails here.

1191
01:12:42.271 --> 01:12:45.000
This one's going to be a little bit short because I haven't done any fucking

1192
01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:49.230
Christmas shopping because I've been getting ready to do my special,

1193
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:53.880
um,
anyways,
uh,
built.
Now here's why.

1194
01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.330
This is an email that I got from somebody and this really amaze me.

1195
01:12:57.510 --> 01:13:02.510
This minds set amazes me and I understand that I am not a doctor and then I am

1196
01:13:03.271 --> 01:13:06.900
not a scientist.
So,
uh,

1197
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:11.640
I really can't medically defend my positioning other than I just think I'm right

1198
01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:15.150
on this one.
All right.
Um,

1199
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.930
all right,
bill,
I don't know if you will actually do a subject for this,

1200
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:23.931
but I've gotten a ton into a ton of arguments with friends slash strangers about

1201
01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:31.670
how now it's being said that homosexuals are born homosexuals.

1202
01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:35.040
They're saying it's like a gene.
Personally,

1203
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:37.530
I think it's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.

1204
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.140
And to me it seems like a big excuse.

1205
01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:43.830
So the world will leave the gay community alone.

1206
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.450
I didn't know the world was,
was bugging them.
Um,

1207
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.210
I've been leaving the gay community alone my entire life.
Oh,
that's not true.

1208
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:58.710
I left.
It's a lot of homophobic shit when I was younger,
you know.
All right.

1209
01:13:58.711 --> 01:14:03.600
Hang on a second.
Fuck.

1210
01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:08.700
Anyways.
Personally,
if you want a dick in your ass,

1211
01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:13.120
by all means get her done.
There is a major red flag.

1212
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:20.730
<v 8>Ah,</v>

1213
01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.490
<v 3>people are still saying that.
You know,
you got to dream in life.</v>

1214
01:14:25.491 --> 01:14:30.260
Keep on trucking.
Oh whoop.
There it is.
Um,

1215
01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.890
just think it's a choice anyways.

1216
01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:38.740
I just think it's a choice.
And you choose to be a flamer.
Um,

1217
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:42.590
if you want to get tactical,
then how dumb would it be to say,
yeah,
dude,

1218
01:14:42.591 --> 01:14:47.420
fucking Michael Jordan had a gene in his body and he was born out of the vantage

1219
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.260
to be a basketball player.
I think it's absolute bullshit.

1220
01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:54.230
And if you a gay who gives a fuck about what the world thinks,

1221
01:14:54.231 --> 01:14:56.420
just do what you want and screw everybody.
Right.

1222
01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:01.770
And they're also saying being gay is the new black,
uh,
who,

1223
01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.850
who are these people who are saying this?
Are they saying this on TV?

1224
01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.330
That sounds like a fashion show.
Okay.
Uh,

1225
01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:13.400
next up gay is the new black.
Oh yeah.
Mother fuckers.

1226
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.240
Uh,
I'm sorry,

1227
01:15:15.241 --> 01:15:19.380
but comparing homosexuals to African Americans seems like the biggest slap in

1228
01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:20.970
the face to the black community.

1229
01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:24.600
These guys are really big on saying community and giving back handed compliment.

1230
01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:29.700
Um,
anyway,
I'm a moron.
And if you,
uh,
what's your opinion on the subject?

1231
01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.410
Uh,
yeah,
I would agree with you.

1232
01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.870
You are a moron and a no.

1233
01:15:34.871 --> 01:15:37.300
I think gay people are born that way and yes,

1234
01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:40.720
I think Michael Jordan was Michael Jordan was born with a gift.

1235
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:45.320
Do you think you can just practice?
You know,

1236
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.620
no matter how proud Howard I practiced to fucking,

1237
01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:52.070
I could never take off from the fire line dunk a basketball.

1238
01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.900
I could never change the game.
He changed the fucking game.
He was born.

1239
01:15:56.930 --> 01:16:01.370
He was born with a gift.
Yes he was.
Um,

1240
01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.290
I don't think that that's a,
that's a a,

1241
01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.720
that's a good example though.

1242
01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:10.240
Cause you're talking about something more like that was a gift.

1243
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:14.710
What you should have used it as an example.
That's like saying you were,
you came,

1244
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:18.040
you were born just to like pussy.
You know,

1245
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.260
what was the big turning point in your life,
sir?

1246
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.260
Where there was a dick on the table and a vagina.

1247
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:28.290
Do you remember like what was it that made you finally make the decision that

1248
01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:32.640
you are going to like women think about it.

1249
01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.270
They never really was a choice was there,
you just did.

1250
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.530
It was just natural within you and someone could have made you aware of fucking

1251
01:16:40.531 --> 01:16:44.580
dress.
You know,
your whole fucking child did.

1252
01:16:44.581 --> 01:16:49.500
You'd still want to bank j Lo because that's how you're wired.
All right?
So

1253
01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:54.750
you know,
get your head out of your ass.
You fucking moron.
You're a moron.

1254
01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.780
You're a moron.
All right.

1255
01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:00.740
I actually went back and forth text messaging and then he brought up the Bible.

1256
01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:04.880
How it says that the fucking Bible you just said,
you know,
God Damn Bible,

1257
01:17:04.881 --> 01:17:09.530
I swear to God,
I can't,
I can't get over how stupid most are.

1258
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:14.531
Who read the fucking Bible where they're reading this stuff and it's supposed to

1259
01:17:14.571 --> 01:17:17.690
make them this,
this,
this more,
uh,

1260
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:22.160
I don't know what holier person and all it does is it just creates this fucking

1261
01:17:22.161 --> 01:17:26.360
resentment to other people and everything they think they fucking end up doing

1262
01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.670
is like,
they just are lashing out at other people.
And it's just like,

1263
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:36.020
how do they not see the fucking irony in that?
It doesn't even make any sense.

1264
01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:40.790
And how do you not understand that God didn't write that Book and God wasn't

1265
01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:45.660
yelling down from,
you know,
you know,

1266
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.630
he wasn't doing that.
All right.
The 10 Commandments,
first of all,

1267
01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:54.670
are came from people.
All right?
This is ridiculous.

1268
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:59.480
I'm saying this like I know this for a fact,
but
I dunno.
I think,

1269
01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:03.980
I think all of that.
I think morality,
unless you're born is sociopath.

1270
01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:07.370
Morality is within you.

1271
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:11.630
And I think your feelings have a higher power and afterlife,

1272
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.160
all of that are within you.

1273
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:17.960
And that natural feeling of when you do something good,
you feel good.

1274
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:22.430
And when you do something bad,
you feel bad.
Is

1275
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:26.690
that to me is the higher power.

1276
01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.830
I don't need to go into a frigging church or any of that.
Okay.

1277
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.950
I believe in all that meditating,
I believe in a lot of stuff,

1278
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:37.790
but I also believe that the same way you guys could be going like,
dude,

1279
01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:41.180
what is this based in?
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
That's,

1280
01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.210
but neither have the people in the church.
They don't know either.

1281
01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:47.030
They've never died.
They don't know what the fuck.
It's all fucking guests,

1282
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:51.650
but all I know
is that,
you know,

1283
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.710
I'm not going to walk around and starting to fucking hate people because some

1284
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:59.600
fucking book that some guy wrote,
you know,
thousands of years.
It's stupid.

1285
01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:03.410
It's fucking stupid.
All right?
You don't know what you're talking about,
sir.

1286
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.080
The same way you naturally like,
okay,
if,

1287
01:19:07.081 --> 01:19:10.550
if being gay was a choice than being heterosexual would be a choice.

1288
01:19:10.551 --> 01:19:13.910
And at some point in your life,
you got to tell me when you made that choice,

1289
01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.530
when you were sitting there,
you know,

1290
01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:20.180
when you were looking at Tommy and you were looking at Stephanie and you're
like,

1291
01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:24.920
ah,
how am I going to play this?
How am I gonna fucking play this?
You know,

1292
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.960
think about it.
There's that time when you're a little kid,
whereas a boy,

1293
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:33.070
girls are gross.
You're like guy that grows,
Eh,

1294
01:19:33.071 --> 01:19:36.650
and they touch you and then you got fucking germs and then you fucking wipe it

1295
01:19:36.651 --> 01:19:40.190
off.
You try to touch somebody else with it.
Remember that,
that dumb shit.

1296
01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.820
But during that point because you're finding them repulsive.

1297
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:46.070
You're not looking at your best buddy going,
oh,

1298
01:19:46.071 --> 01:19:50.090
what I love to get him in the tree fort.
You know,
you just go play football.

1299
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.820
Then gradually get a little bit older,
right?

1300
01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:55.100
The girls get a little more physically attractive.

1301
01:19:55.101 --> 01:19:59.750
He started looking at their fucking clams and then you're in there and you spend

1302
01:19:59.751 --> 01:20:02.900
the rest of your life chasing it and it's totally,

1303
01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:08.100
completely 100% natural and that's,

1304
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.790
you just flipped around.
That's what gay guys do.
The same fucking thing.

1305
01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:15.780
It's not a cheap just born that way.
He stopped being a fucking hateful cunt.

1306
01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:21.810
All right,
there we go.
Ah,
that was very,
we are the world,

1307
01:20:21.811 --> 01:20:26.760
isn't it?
Look at me being all fucking accepting of people.
I don't hate like,

1308
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:28.100
like people like that.
Like if a,

1309
01:20:28.101 --> 01:20:32.340
if a gay guy fucking is in front of me and he doesn't pull all the way out in

1310
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:36.930
the fucking intersection,
you know,
so I can make the light too,

1311
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.930
you know?
That's when I hate the guy,
you know,

1312
01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:44.580
fucking Paul all the way out day.
You fucking Cock sucker

1313
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:52.110
when it has to do with his driver,
not with his sexual preference.
All right,

1314
01:20:52.111 --> 01:20:56.970
let's plow ahead here.
All right,
broads,
this is the next topic.
Uh,

1315
01:20:56.971 --> 01:20:58.410
I need to,
um,

1316
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.610
include myself into the manipulative discussion by mentioning,

1317
01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.880
I think he's talking about women here mentioning the occurrences of female

1318
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:10.881
friends who seem to think you should do what a boyfriend would do even though

1319
01:21:11.010 --> 01:21:13.800
you're not and never will be their boyfriend.

1320
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.530
My story is this.

1321
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:21.830
I recently reconnected with the girl on Facebook that I basically just knew I

1322
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:26.640
knew of in high school and maybe had three conversations with in the whole four

1323
01:21:26.641 --> 01:21:30.330
year run.
All right.
He recently connected with her.
In other words,

1324
01:21:30.331 --> 01:21:32.160
he wanted to bang her back in the day,

1325
01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:36.210
but he either felt he was too much of a loser.
Yeah,

1326
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:40.140
I recently reconnected.
You,
you'll seek her out.
What do what she's doing?

1327
01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:44.100
Cause she still looked good.
God Damn even better.
She's 28.

1328
01:21:44.101 --> 01:21:47.460
She probably knows how to suck a dick now.
I think I'm going to reconnect.

1329
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:50.850
Good move,
sir.
Good move.
Um,

1330
01:21:50.851 --> 01:21:55.470
she likes cool music and I like cool music so we could connect on various videos

1331
01:21:55.471 --> 01:21:59.640
we posted,
etc. Working your way in virally.
I like this.

1332
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.650
She was coming to New York where I live perfect from our hometown for

1333
01:22:04.651 --> 01:22:08.550
Thanksgiving since her brother lives in Brooklyn.
Um,

1334
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:10.320
now I was friends with her brother,

1335
01:22:10.321 --> 01:22:13.320
so I thought it would be cool to hang out with them at a bar.

1336
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:14.370
Now it's getting a little weird.

1337
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:17.860
You're friends with her brother and he's trying to bang her sister.
Um,

1338
01:22:17.970 --> 01:22:19.470
I'm really super imposing my thoughts.

1339
01:22:19.471 --> 01:22:23.190
Why don't I shut the fuck up and just read this?
Okay.
Here we go.
Um,

1340
01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.240
everything went fine.

1341
01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:29.160
We had our drinks caught up on what we could catch up on and I thought that,
um,

1342
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:33.960
I thought should,
should be at,
besides email,

1343
01:22:33.961 --> 01:22:37.230
left out some words and I thought that should,

1344
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:40.501
I don't know,

1345
01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:45.210
some bullshit Facebook where it however some band is playing in New York and she

1346
01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:49.710
wants to go.
I think the band is fine,
but I'm not a real big fan.
All right.

1347
01:22:49.711 --> 01:22:53.370
I know.
I just couldn't read that last,
the previous sentence.

1348
01:22:53.371 --> 01:22:57.360
So basically she wants to go see a band that he's not really into.
Um,

1349
01:22:57.361 --> 01:23:01.050
she seems to have her to heads that since I happen to live in New York,

1350
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:04.170
and I guess she has no one else to go see the bandwidth,

1351
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:07.960
that I should automatically want to go with her to see a band.

1352
01:23:07.961 --> 01:23:12.280
I don't want to see with someone who was a friend and only the loosest of terms

1353
01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.020
I said I would pass.

1354
01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:18.400
And then that produced a flurry of passive aggressive emails,

1355
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:23.410
the intent of which makes me feel like I rejected her,
of course,
that,

1356
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:28.090
uh,
wasn't it,
but also what would it matter?
I barely know her.

1357
01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:29.800
Any reasonable person,

1358
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:34.150
which should suggest the idea and if the idea isn't accepted,
would move on,

1359
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.060
but she can't pat possibly go by herself.

1360
01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:39.760
So she's trying to manipulate me with self pity.

1361
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.810
She just doesn't want to be alone.
She doesn't want to be alone.

1362
01:23:43.811 --> 01:23:47.290
My company or someone else's would make no difference.
So I finally,

1363
01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:52.720
so I find it all very insulting to my intelligence that she's trying to make me

1364
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:56.440
think this is a connection only we share.
Um,

1365
01:23:56.530 --> 01:24:01.210
I made it clear I'm not going to the show anyways.

1366
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:04.570
I've shared this with my friends and apparently that is widespread.

1367
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:07.180
I just find it as getting out of control when a fee,

1368
01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:12.260
when a female in our lives that is not in our family expects to be treated with

1369
01:24:12.611 --> 01:24:17.611
the same considerations as a romantic connection in which we obviously have to

1370
01:24:18.071 --> 01:24:21.220
do shit.
We really don't want to do.
All right.

1371
01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:26.740
Okay.
I see what you're saying here,
but I think,
um,

1372
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.600
part of her probably wants to hook up with you.

1373
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:35.980
So that's probably why she was feeling rejected a little bit.

1374
01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:40.780
Um,
but what I would do in that thing,
but now,
you know,

1375
01:24:40.781 --> 01:24:44.890
I'm really not feeling that,
but listen,
I know this cool bar,
you know,

1376
01:24:44.891 --> 01:24:48.490
up to street,
maybe we could go do this,
blah,
blah blah.
See how that feels.
Uh,
uh,

1377
01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:52.500
I dunno.
Maybe it did that.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
But yeah,
that would be annoying.

1378
01:24:52.730 --> 01:24:55.390
You know,
if she wanted to go fucking see it.
I Dunno.
I Dunno how to,

1379
01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:58.630
I don't know how to,
uh,
how to answer this one here.

1380
01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:04.000
They come out of a fucking
missed the boat on this one.

1381
01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:08.260
Dude,
you shouldn't have to go to,
you know,
look at,
you know what you got to do.

1382
01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:08.651
I'll tell you,

1383
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:13.510
if you guys want to see a great example of how to fucking handle women,

1384
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:17.320
I swear to God,
watch the Jersey Shore.
Okay.

1385
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:18.910
I know you're rolling your eyes right now.

1386
01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:21.520
And as much as people are laughing at that kid who was like,
you know,

1387
01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:25.660
it takes me 25 minutes to do my hair.
Oh my God.
I said not to touch it.

1388
01:25:25.661 --> 01:25:29.160
And then you'd touched it.
Oh that fucking dude who,

1389
01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.700
who has the Travis Barker Cadillac Tattoo.
Um,

1390
01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:39.040
that fucking dude,
if you watch the episode was snuck,
gets blasted in the face.

1391
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:44.670
That dude understands exactly how to hook up with women and how not to get into

1392
01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:52.210
a fucking relationship.
And then also how not to give a fuck if they get mad.

1393
01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.640
He,
I'm telling you like I'm looking at that guy going,

1394
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:58.840
this fucking guy possesses the knowledge of women.

1395
01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.520
Then I,
it took me 41 years to figure out,
and he knows that 20,

1396
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:07.670
and he's in his peak physical condition.
This guy's a fucking kids.
My hero,

1397
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:12.320
when that dude,
uh,
uh,
the situation,
I was going to say,

1398
01:26:12.321 --> 01:26:16.400
the suggestion when he fucking comes back with the two girls,
right?

1399
01:26:16.401 --> 01:26:20.060
And one of them's a mass and the other one's hot and he's a fucking wing man for

1400
01:26:20.061 --> 01:26:22.310
him.
And he's hanging in there and he's hanging in there.

1401
01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.070
And then it gets to the point where the other,

1402
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.670
where the situation's not gonna hook up,
hey taps out.
And he said,
he goes,
look,

1403
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:31.010
you know the deal.
You meet him,
you bring him back,
give him a drink,

1404
01:26:31.011 --> 01:26:34.520
get him in the hot tub and then hook up with them.
You know,
that's the deal.

1405
01:26:34.521 --> 01:26:38.270
If you can't fucking do it,
I'm out.
And he just was totally fucking,

1406
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:42.980
I'm telling you,
he has,
he has it down.
So what you gotta do on this girls,

1407
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:46.280
something like that is it's the girls coming around,
she's saying,

1408
01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:50.660
I want to go see this band.
Just don't ever get upset.
It just be a little,

1409
01:26:50.661 --> 01:26:51.910
I'm not,
I'm not fucking intuit.

1410
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.630
And then walk away and don't even let it like consume your life to the point we

1411
01:26:56.631 --> 01:27:01.160
actually go out and you talk to your friends about it because you just wasted

1412
01:27:01.161 --> 01:27:05.780
energy should be out there talking to some other girl.
Hey,
go fuck that girl,

1413
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:10.460
fuck her and fuck her fucking concert.
You did the right God damn thing.
Um,

1414
01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:13.910
by the way,
let me get to the questions for this week because somebody,

1415
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:16.490
I might as well do that because this will actually make it flow a little more

1416
01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:18.740
cause somebody,
uh,
um,

1417
01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:22.100
somebody says,
okay,
bill,

1418
01:27:22.101 --> 01:27:26.540
I want to know your thoughts on the prick that deck Snookie at the end of last

1419
01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.340
week's episode.
But uh,

1420
01:27:28.341 --> 01:27:33.341
I also have to get your take on Mike Aka the situation and his buddies attempts

1421
01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:37.580
to get laid hilarious.
Uh,

1422
01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:43.790
dude,
his buddy is getting all the fucking ass on the planet.
Mike the situation.

1423
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:47.840
I Dunno.
He,
he,
he's not a closer,

1424
01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.300
he's really good at getting the appointments,

1425
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:55.100
but he's not a fucking closer and uh,

1426
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:59.990
he's,
he's like,
he wants to be the other dude,
but he's not the other dude.

1427
01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:02.060
He's got it down.
Have you,

1428
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:04.070
every time it goes out of the club he's making out with some girl.

1429
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:06.740
He's grabbing her fucking titties,
that bringing girls back.

1430
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:09.410
They see them on the street.
The Guy,
I'm telling you,
the guy is a fucking,

1431
01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:14.840
you know,
I had fun.
I don't even think I have gained like that now.

1432
01:28:14.841 --> 01:28:17.450
Even if I could go back when all this shit I know now from went back,

1433
01:28:17.451 --> 01:28:21.170
I wouldn't be as good.
That fucking kid.
He's the shit that kids is.
Shit,
Mike,

1434
01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:26.120
this situation,
this situation,
Mike,
is,
you can't close the fucking deal.

1435
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.800
And as far as the dude who punched deck,
sneaky,
uh,
that was,
it was brutal.
I know.

1436
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:35.610
I made fun of that girl with the leg sweep.
She fell down.
She was like,
oh my God.

1437
01:28:35.611 --> 01:28:39.320
And it was funny that girl Snooky was like,
was sobbing.

1438
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:44.810
I felt horrible.
I felt really bad for her and that guy is a fucking animal who,

1439
01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.410
um,
they should treat them like a pit bull.
They should,
you know,

1440
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.110
get bold bites somebody to take them down the fucking street and they put him

1441
01:28:51.111 --> 01:28:53.120
out of his misery.
That's what they should do with that guy.

1442
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:56.630
And they should take them.
They should literally take them to an animal shelter,

1443
01:28:56.631 --> 01:29:00.560
to not even a place for humans and just,
you know,
lay him on the table,

1444
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.570
have a muzzle on his face.
I like how he tried to s,
I forget the guy's name,

1445
01:29:06.571 --> 01:29:11.160
but like say whatever his name is,
Mike Johnson or something.
He's like,
you know,

1446
01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:12.420
that's not the way I was raised.

1447
01:29:12.421 --> 01:29:16.650
What you saw in that video is not the real Mike Johnson.
Yeah,
it is.
It is.

1448
01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:21.480
That is you,
that is you.
That is you and you're drunk.
I'm sorry.

1449
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:24.870
That's you.
That's a,
that's a part of you.
You fucking asshole.

1450
01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.140
I liked those people.
They try to blame the alcohol.
Like,

1451
01:29:28.141 --> 01:29:32.440
if they say something racist or they fucking blast some girl in the face and the

1452
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:35.730
tribe,
that's not the real me.
You know,
I got this problem,

1453
01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.810
I drink alcohol and I become this different Perth.
Fuck you now.
Your doubt,

1454
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.440
your doubt.
You know,

1455
01:29:43.441 --> 01:29:45.720
a drunk man's words are a sober man's thoughts.

1456
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.590
It's one of the greatest fucking quotes ever.
You don't become somebody else.

1457
01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.550
You know,
maybe your,
your,
your,
you have a shorter fucking temper,

1458
01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:58.410
but there's no fucking way that guys never punched a girl in the face ever.

1459
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:03.930
He wasn't even that drunk.
It wasn't like he was falling down drunk.

1460
01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.880
I think when she called him ugly,
I think that really touched in on some,
uh,

1461
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.120
childhood shit because the dude is ugly and you know,

1462
01:30:12.121 --> 01:30:15.780
he lifted a bunch of weights trying to be like,
no,
don't look at the face.

1463
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:19.560
Look down here.
This looks good.
Right?
I think she tapped in on some shit.

1464
01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.133
Um,

1465
01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:26.310
but that was the classic situation of a woman just not feeling like she's ever

1466
01:30:26.311 --> 01:30:30.630
going to get hit because I would never stand up on a bar stool.

1467
01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:33.390
And we talk about a horrible way to begin to fight.

1468
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:36.900
I'm going to stand up on a bar stool with my feet,
you know,
instead of,
you know,

1469
01:30:36.901 --> 01:30:38.550
that little things.
So your feet don't dangle,

1470
01:30:38.551 --> 01:30:39.800
you know that part of the bar stool.
He,

1471
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:44.460
she was standing on that and then she leans over and I'm gonna lead with my
chin.

1472
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.870
Hey,
you ugly motherfucker,
you know,

1473
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.660
ah,
terrible move on her part.
He just fucking,

1474
01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:57.660
it was a straight left fire.
If I remember correctly,

1475
01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:02.010
you guys ever watched when we were kings and Ali was hitting a George Foreman

1476
01:31:02.011 --> 01:31:05.070
with the straight right.
The one punchy wasn't ready for it.

1477
01:31:05.071 --> 01:31:09.150
He was doing it as a southpaw.
Oh Man.
He,
uh,
that was,

1478
01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:12.720
that was like a loose,
some fillings that was like blunt.

1479
01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:16.380
I thought it was horrible.
I didn't think it was funny at all.
And uh,

1480
01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:20.880
that guy should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and uh,

1481
01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:22.770
he shouldn't put the guy down,
but you know what she's doing,

1482
01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:24.630
he should have them out in the backyard.
You know,

1483
01:31:24.631 --> 01:31:27.750
like you deal with those dogs where you have him on that wire and you have the

1484
01:31:27.751 --> 01:31:31.710
leash attached to it,
you know,
and then ugly girls,
I'm not ugly girls.

1485
01:31:31.711 --> 01:31:33.000
Girls should be yelling over the fence,

1486
01:31:33.001 --> 01:31:35.060
telling them how they are ugly and you imagine your mother fucker.

1487
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:36.810
Then as he runs the lease,

1488
01:31:36.811 --> 01:31:40.320
just fucking yanks his neck and his feet go flying out from underneath him.

1489
01:31:41.010 --> 01:31:45.900
He should do that for a month.
Um,
yeah,
so there you go.
All right,
next question.

1490
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:50.310
Uh,
Bill,
I just started listening to your podcast and it was one,
oh,

1491
01:31:50.311 --> 01:31:51.210
this is a great question.

1492
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:55.080
I was wondering if you ever look at a funeral procession.

1493
01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.910
If you ever look at funeral processions.
Um,

1494
01:31:57.930 --> 01:32:02.930
I try and catch someone in the cars that don't care about the dead guy in front

1495
01:32:03.221 --> 01:32:07.320
of them,
in the hearse and notice that the car,
uh,

1496
01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:09.760
and try to notice that car full of people laughing.

1497
01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:14.710
Do you ever do this and when are you coming back to the Boston area?
Uh,

1498
01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:17.740
well,
I'm just booking my 2010 now,
so I'll be coming back next year.

1499
01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:21.790
At some point.
I'm absolutely,
I always do that.
There's always a,

1500
01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.050
um,
what is that

1501
01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.600
morbid curiosity to try to figure out which car has the people who were directly

1502
01:32:33.101 --> 01:32:36.120
related who gives a fuck the most?
Yeah.

1503
01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.540
And as a funeral procession goes down and down and down and down,

1504
01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.140
it starts becoming third cousins.

1505
01:32:41.141 --> 01:32:44.050
As someone who worked with the guide back in the 60s.
Yeah.

1506
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.420
By the time he gets to the back,
yeah,

1507
01:32:46.421 --> 01:32:49.840
there's like people watching DVDs in the head rests,
you know,

1508
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.710
drinking Margaritas.
I definitely do that shit.
Um,

1509
01:32:53.711 --> 01:32:56.290
and I'm glad you asked that question cause I really thought I was the only

1510
01:32:56.291 --> 01:33:00.700
fucking person who does it.
Um,
all right,
I got to wrap up this podcast here.

1511
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.850
It's going to be a little quick.
People just,
no,
it isn't 46 minutes in.

1512
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.410
Look at me.
Look at fucking me.
Let me read a couple of things here.
Here's a quiz.

1513
01:33:08.411 --> 01:33:11.920
A quote I read,
somebody sent to me about the press.

1514
01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:17.320
Listen to this shit is a little conspiracy kind of shit.
Uh,
John Swinton,

1515
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:19.510
the former chief of staff for the New York Times,

1516
01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:24.010
was asked to give a toast to the independent press before the New York Press

1517
01:33:24.011 --> 01:33:25.680
Club.
Um,

1518
01:33:25.710 --> 01:33:29.680
it is obvious that he believed that the comps concept of an independent press

1519
01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:34.950
was a farce that he no longer wished to be a party to the following is reported

1520
01:33:34.991 --> 01:33:38.770
to be a quote from is monumentally revealing toast.

1521
01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:44.470
Um,
all right,
so this is basically a reported quote.
No one can even confirm this.

1522
01:33:44.471 --> 01:33:47.920
Got To love the Internet.
This is what the guy says about the independent press.

1523
01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:52.840
Uh,
there is no such thing at this date,
uh,
of the world's history in America,

1524
01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:56.890
uh,
of an independent press.
You know it and I know it.

1525
01:33:56.910 --> 01:34:00.550
There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions.
And if you did,

1526
01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:03.700
you know beforehand that it would never appear in print.

1527
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:07.810
I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the Pie.
Out of the paper.

1528
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:13.350
Others of you are paid similar salaries of similar things for similar things.

1529
01:34:14.050 --> 01:34:16.990
And any of you who would be so foolish as to write your armies.

1530
01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:22.010
Honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job.
If I was,
if,

1531
01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.950
if I allowed my honest opinions to peer in one issue of the paper before 24

1532
01:34:26.951 --> 01:34:28.930
hours,
my occupation would be gone.

1533
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:33.880
The business of journalism is to destroy the truth,
to lie outright,
to pervert,

1534
01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:37.930
to vilify to Fawn,
and at the feet of mammon.

1535
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:42.490
I don't know what the fuck that means and to sell this country and his race for

1536
01:34:42.491 --> 01:34:45.610
his daily bread.
You know,
at nine,
no,
it what folly.

1537
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:48.460
This is toasting to an into print independent press.

1538
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:52.480
We are the tools and vassal of rich people are rich men.

1539
01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.990
You know,
if that was supposed to say vessel behind the scenes,

1540
01:34:55.991 --> 01:34:59.450
we are jumping jacks.
They pull the strings and we dance our talents.

1541
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:03.950
Our possibilities in our lives are all the property of other men.

1542
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:07.640
We are intellectual prostitutes.
You know?

1543
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:11.210
Can't you just see Michael Douglas giving that speech in one final effort to win

1544
01:35:11.211 --> 01:35:15.740
an Oscar in some melodramatic movie that Oprah would fucking recommend?

1545
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.220
You have to see this movie.
It's so important.
Excuse me,

1546
01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.500
I'm going to eat another glazed pork chop.
Um,

1547
01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.480
all right.
That might that I think that might be the podcast this week.

1548
01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.310
I'm trying to get to one other thing here.
Once again,

1549
01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:31.730
I want to thank everybody who came out to my special.
I'm so fucking proud of it.

1550
01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:36.940
Um,
I really,
really think I got a good one.
And um,

1551
01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:41.150
I'm trying to chill out.
I'm chilling out.

1552
01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.050
I'm actually taking a vacation here until January 15th.

1553
01:35:45.051 --> 01:35:48.500
That's how fucking lawn and I'm off.
I went to Stubhub,

1554
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:52.820
I got my rose bowl tickets,
me and Joe Barton Nica going again this year.

1555
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:56.690
I got a little place out here where I know I can get a couple of,
you know,

1556
01:35:56.691 --> 01:36:00.860
what's a couple of Stowe geese of the,
uh,

1557
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:04.190
Desi Arnaz variety,
if you know what I mean.

1558
01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:08.990
And uh,
you know the ducks first,
the bucks,

1559
01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:10.130
we're going to go see that shit.

1560
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:12.980
I'm actually toying with maybe going to the bcs game,

1561
01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:17.180
but they want so much fucking money,
but a,
it's right up the fucking street.

1562
01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:20.060
How do you not go?
So a,
you should be asking yourself,
Bill,

1563
01:36:20.061 --> 01:36:22.760
what are you gonna be doing during the break?
Absolutely fucking nothing.

1564
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:28.460
Can I get over this cough?
I'm going to try to work out a little bit.
And,
uh,

1565
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:34.220
I've been playing my guitar.
I have a new guitar hero,
uh,
Duane Allman,

1566
01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:35.540
you know,

1567
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.330
I used to listen to the almond brothers and shit when it came on the radio when

1568
01:36:38.331 --> 01:36:40.160
I used to work in a warehouse is back in the day,

1569
01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.770
but I didn't have an appreciation to what I was listening to.

1570
01:36:42.771 --> 01:36:46.160
And Duane Allman and Dickey Betts,
it become,
uh,

1571
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
like I am downloading everything they've ever been on and uh,

1572
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.280
and have now totally fascinated with the fact that Duane Allman used to sounds

1573
01:36:57.801 --> 01:37:01.970
that he would just show up at studios and play on other people's albums and not

1574
01:37:01.971 --> 01:37:06.410
even be credited.
So they were actually saying like,
you don't even really know,

1575
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:10.850
you know,
how much work that the guy did.
I don't know.

1576
01:37:10.851 --> 01:37:13.040
He just fucking seem like he loved playing.
You know,

1577
01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:15.080
what's amazing about Duane Allman?
He should look at the guy,

1578
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:17.900
he looks like he's fucking 37 years old.

1579
01:37:18.650 --> 01:37:22.490
I don't know what it was about people back in the day.
They just looked old,

1580
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.390
you know,
I mean it probably doesn't dude.

1581
01:37:26.391 --> 01:37:30.830
That's the guy from truth and salvage company.
That's the fucking beard mustache.

1582
01:37:30.831 --> 01:37:33.110
She has,
I was saying,
you lyses s grant,

1583
01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.840
it's via Duane Allman.

1584
01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:39.590
It's that fucking Elvis Presley mutton shopped thing.

1585
01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.880
And right as it goes to your Chin where it'd be this big Grizzly Adam Beard,

1586
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:48.920
you just hook it right up.
It makes a u turn right around your mouth.
Like it's,

1587
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:52.430
it's then going to go around and go back up.
You same cheekbone,
but it doesn't,

1588
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:55.710
it goes,
it's like almost like it pulls into the station,

1589
01:37:55.711 --> 01:37:57.690
underneath your nose and then goes right back up.

1590
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.600
He goes right up to your other ear.
Um,

1591
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:03.690
I was with someone yesterday.
I went to go,

1592
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:06.480
I went to go buy that live at the Fillmore east album,
uh,

1593
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:11.040
on record and uh,
and I was going to look at,
look at that guy.

1594
01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:13.230
That's Duane Allman Nigga.
How old do you think he is?
And he's like,
I don't know,

1595
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:16.200
mid thirties.
So I'm like,
the guy died it fucking 24.

1596
01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:19.470
I think maybe it was almost 25.
But uh,
anyways,

1597
01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.320
there's a clip actually on youtube if you want to see it.

1598
01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:23.940
Look up the Allman brothers,

1599
01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:28.320
I can't remember the uh Oh wait a minute.

1600
01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:32.630
Hang on a second.
I got to get you,
I got to get you this.
There's one with they,

1601
01:38:32.631 --> 01:38:37.631
they play on the tonight show where it's still Johnny Carson and you want to

1602
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:40.170
talk about an unbelievable musicians first of all,

1603
01:38:40.171 --> 01:38:43.380
the tonight show band with doc savage sins in,
in all of those guys.

1604
01:38:43.410 --> 01:38:48.030
Unbelievable players.
So they come out and the Allman brothers play one of their,

1605
01:38:48.031 --> 01:38:50.280
you know,
they have blues rock things.

1606
01:38:50.281 --> 01:38:53.620
Absolutely rip it up and then you know,
they didn't,

1607
01:38:53.621 --> 01:38:56.550
they play for like five minutes and then when they're done John,
he's like,

1608
01:38:56.551 --> 01:38:57.330
all right,
we're going to do something.

1609
01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:59.700
A little different docs going to come out and play with the band.

1610
01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:03.360
Then they did like this tribute to Charley Parker,
like this jazz thing.

1611
01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.510
And they just,
they were right there with doc and all those,

1612
01:39:06.511 --> 01:39:09.180
all the fucking tonight show guys.
It was,
it was unbelievable.

1613
01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:14.250
So I'm just look up the Allman brothers tonight show.
Fuck.

1614
01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.113
Sorry.

1615
01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:20.820
But if you're not into that and you want to watch bill Graham yell at somebody,

1616
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:26.040
I got to bring this up for you.
I'm sorry man.
Hang on a second.
It's a,

1617
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:28.020
you just search,
uh,

1618
01:39:28.450 --> 01:39:33.330
Fillmore last days.

1619
01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:38.190
Let me see if I can find it.
Here you go.
Oh yeah.
All right.

1620
01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:42.660
Just search Phil.
The last days,

1621
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:47.220
search this and me and my girlfriend always make fun of how like hippies talked

1622
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:52.530
in the 60s the way they said,
man,
they say it was almost like m y a n like,

1623
01:39:52.531 --> 01:39:56.400
Hey Nian.
Then I try and get hassled me in.

1624
01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.370
So basically this,
this fucking video,

1625
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:02.790
it's Bill Graham getting ready to do the last show at the Fillmore West,

1626
01:40:02.791 --> 01:40:04.200
the one down on market street.

1627
01:40:05.010 --> 01:40:10.010
And he decided that he was going to have all just San Francisco bands and a,

1628
01:40:10.111 --> 01:40:11.460
so this guy comes in,

1629
01:40:11.461 --> 01:40:16.461
he's a member of this band that doesn't get to be put on the bill and he's upset

1630
01:40:17.101 --> 01:40:18.270
with Bill Graham and he's,

1631
01:40:18.271 --> 01:40:23.271
he's trying to get on the fucking show and Bill Graham won't put them on and

1632
01:40:24.481 --> 01:40:27.300
they ended up having this fucking argument.
Let me see if I can get to it here.

1633
01:40:27.450 --> 01:40:31.570
Of course they're not going to show it.
And he's just like,
you know,
man,

1634
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:34.650
it's like I can dig at me.
And it's just like,
you know,
I mean,

1635
01:40:34.651 --> 01:40:39.440
we're selling more tickets than they are man.
And he's just like,
you know,
I mean,

1636
01:40:39.441 --> 01:40:41.160
it's just like far out man.

1637
01:40:41.250 --> 01:40:44.640
And it ends up escalating to the point.

1638
01:40:45.150 --> 01:40:47.580
And Bill Graham's being like totally legitimate.
He goes,
well,

1639
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:51.000
you should just respect that.
I'm being honest with you,
man to man.

1640
01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:56.120
And it escalates to the point Bill Graham is not budging and this guy has no

1641
01:40:56.591 --> 01:40:59.620
other argument and he makes the worst fucking decision he can make,

1642
01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:02.470
which is basically tells bill Graham to go fuck himself.

1643
01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:05.920
Not knowing that Bill Graham evidently had a big time temper,

1644
01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:10.060
had fought in Korea,
and as an absolute psycho,
um,

1645
01:41:10.061 --> 01:41:14.470
if you just want to watch bill Graham chase a hippy out of the Fillmore West,

1646
01:41:14.471 --> 01:41:18.910
you got to watch this thing.
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,
it's a little bit long.

1647
01:41:18.911 --> 01:41:22.060
If you're not into the beginning,
just skip to it.
You'll see it's a guy comes in,

1648
01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:26.650
he's wearing like the rob Helford leather hat.
Uh,
but anyways,
that is it.

1649
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:30.490
That's the podcast for this week.
Merry Christmas to everybody.
Happy Kwanzaa.

1650
01:41:30.491 --> 01:41:34.990
Happy Hanukkah.

1652
01:41:37.151 --> 01:41:38.890
I will talk to you next Monday.

1653
01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.070

thanks to the crew.

1654
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:46.960
Thanks to Molly at the punchline.

everybody,
my management,
parents and everything.

1657
01:41:52.331 --> 01:41:54.160
I feel like I'm accepting an Oscar,

1658
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:57.280
but I feel like I won one because it went that great.
So that's it.

1659
01:41:57.281 --> 01:42:00.160
Everybody have a great week and I will talk to you next Monday,
