00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.753
Hmm.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.410
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
Is Bill burn his time for the Thursday afternoon?</v>

3
00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:07.600
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.990
<v 2>Ah,</v>

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.850
<v 1>just checking in on you.</v>

6
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.220
Just seeing how your weeks go and how things are shaking out.
Jesus Christ.

7
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.440
If I get one more fucking tweak on pill,

8
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:28.940
what do you think of the Kyrie Irving for fucking Isaiah Thomas Trade?

9
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.101
What do I think?

10
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:35.390
I think Danny Ainge is known what the fuck he's doing up until now.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.040
I think it's the trickle down effect of the Kevin Durant trade where you for

12
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:43.880
some reason can just not have enough fucking stars regardless of what your

13
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:47.930
players are doing.
Do you think that gave up too much?

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.370
Only time will tell.
Only time will tell.
I would tell.

15
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:56.150
I would say that I love,
uh,
Isaiah Thomas.

16
00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:00.140
And what sucks about that trade was he was on his way to being like the fucking

17
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.100
big Papi of,
um,
of the Celtics.

18
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.430
Like he was going to have a frigging street named after him the way he was
going.

19
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.350
So it's a,
it's a real shame and a,
it was a,

20
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.710
just a great dude.
And,
uh,
I,
you know,

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.090
I don't know,
I just thought he was a,
he fit in real well with our city.

22
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.770
You know,
he was on his way to being a great Celtic I thought.
And um,

23
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.970
we gave a bunch of fucking people to get another guy who basically does the

24
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:32.300
exact same thing,
has the same amount of stuff.
I don't know.

25
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:36.110
He's a little bit bigger.
I don't know who the fuck knows.

26
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:41.111
All I know is the team that Isaiah succeeded with last year no longer exists

27
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:44.060
here.
So,
you know,
I don't know what the F I don't fucking know.

28
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.170
I hate all of this shit.

29
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:50.171
They gave up a first read Goodie from issue and the silver league,

30
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.050
like how the fuck you get into the NBA to that level or any sport you,

31
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.190
you need to get a fucking life when you start knowing what people fucking make

32
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.270
and all of that shit.
Like I don't,
I,
that's when I tap out.
It's just like,
oh,

33
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:07.310
we traded that guy for that guy.
We'll see what happens.

34
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.070
When does the season start in a couple of months.
Yeah.

35
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:14.720
I fucking think about it then either it's going to work or it's not going to

36
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:19.190
work.
Um,
there was a couple of Celtics fencing,
fucking so stupid.

37
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:21.980
They burned their Isaiah Thomas Jerseys.

38
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.290
Like he left the Celtics,
like he was doing some sort of free agent.
Fuck,

39
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:30.470
he got traded,
you'd dump fucks.
Um,

40
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.430
then of course everybody on Twitter tweets it to me and acts like this is every

41
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:38.870
Celtic fan and it isn't,
it isn't this always these fucking morons,

42
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.120
which is why I have been saying,

43
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.803
<v 0>you know,</v>

44
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.990
<v 1>I would fucking,
I'm telling you right now,</v>

45
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:49.030
this fucking Mayweather McGregor fight,

46
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.610
if he ever wanted to solve the population problem,

47
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:55.210
the amount of mouth breathers that are showing up.
Okay.

48
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.560
You send a fucking signal through the fucking bought whoever orders the fight
it,

49
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.394
you're done.

50
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.590
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.251
<v 1>Something happens.</v>

52
00:03:02.251 --> 00:03:05.440
You know when they used to play in those old spy movies where they would play

53
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.780
that really high pitched fucking noise and people just grab their ears like,

54
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.930
and then they would die.
Yeah.
Do some star Trek Shit.

55
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.733
<v 0>MMM.</v>

56
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.510
<v 1>That's going to go down is one of the biggest fucking rip offs of all fucking</v>

57
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:21.950
time.
Mayweather,
Mcgregor.

58
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.113
<v 0>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.660
<v 1>that's my prediction.
And if it doesn't,</v>

60
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.120
I'll just say I was wrong and then I'll order the fight,

61
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:32.320
but there is no fucking way I'm going to sit there on Saturday night and watch a

62
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:37.321
guy who used to fucking box 1520 fucking years ago fight a guy who fucking

63
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:43.570
retired two years ago who's in his forties and everybody's asking,
acting like,

64
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.110
oh,
there's this to abuse first fucking law.
The guy's in his forties,

65
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.670
he's been retired for two years.

66
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.730
You remember when Jordan came back on the fucking wizards

67
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.980
taking two,
three fucking years off.
You know,
that was basketball.

68
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:02.710
Forget about boxing.
This is like the dumbest thing ever.

69
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.940
You know what it really is?
It's a bunch of fucking losers that want the,

70
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:07.420
you know,

71
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.960
the are unhappy with their own lives that want to see a guy that's been shooting

72
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:14.980
his mouth off saying is life is fucking great and they want to see him get

73
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.820
knocked on his ass and I'm so sick of people go,
it just spectacle.
It.

74
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:22.390
Just practical.
I'm just,
I'm tuning in for this spectacle.

75
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.630
Why are you using that word spectacle?
You fucking moron.

76
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:30.190
Because everybody on an in sports has been saying this since the amount of

77
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:34.450
fucking mouth breathing dopes that I've known,
you know,
and I'm one of them.

78
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.040
I've never heard him use the expression spectacle in my life.
Now it's like,
yeah,

79
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.220
just watch.
I'm watching it for the spectacle.
It's a spectacle.
A sport.

80
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.210
What does that mean exactly?
A spectacle.
You mean?

81
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.180
Is that like a fancy word for,
it's a fucking rip off.

82
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.570
These are the same people that would have paid fucking $60,
you know,

83
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:00.390
the equivalent of $60 30 fucking years ago,

84
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:04.080
40 years ago to watch lie ll Zeto fight fucking Muhammad Ali,

85
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:08.610
which actually happened if he never looked it up.
Alright,
spectacle.

86
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.050
Let's look up the definition of spectacle spectacle number one.
Uh,

87
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.600
something to stare at.
Number two,
a paper view.

88
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:20.520
Rip off now a visually striking performance or display.

89
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

90
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.750
<v 1>And invent or seen.
Regarded in terms of its visual impact.</v>

91
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.380
I Dunno,
I dunno what's going on with sports right now or that,

92
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.400
that fucking league where they just take three people who used to be superstars

93
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:39.900
and played three other people that used to be superstars and a,

94
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:41.660
what do you get out of watching that half court,

95
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:46.410
a basketball confirmation that yes,
we are all going to die.
A slow death.

96
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.250
I'm sorry,
I'm really just being a scrooge.
Enjoy your fucking fight.

97
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.390
I will not be watching it.

98
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:57.710
I'm going to get out on the highway and drive like 80 miles an hour out here in

99
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.630
la,
you know,

100
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.500
and enjoy this city at the population that should be during that fucking fight.

101
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.560
There's so many more constructive things that I can fucking do.

102
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.080
<v 0>And um,</v>

103
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.190
<v 1>this,
you know what it is?</v>

104
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.220
Is it just doing this clearly for the fucking money and uh,

105
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.630
that's it.
So,
you know,
in a way it's,

106
00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:21.230
I'm actually happy for him because they both get in their brains knocked out and

107
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.560
every fucking fight and God knows what's what their quality of life will be in

108
00:06:25.561 --> 00:06:28.920
their fifties so good for them.
Go out and get your fucking money.

109
00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:31.260
But I've given may whether it,
at least,
I dunno,

110
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.560
but his last seven fights times 6,420 bucks,

111
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.320
that he should return at least a portion of it.

112
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.500
He hasn't knocked any a buddy outs and said,
was it Ricky Hatton?

113
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.200
He fights fucking packy out 10 years after he should have the guy shows up with

114
00:06:46.201 --> 00:06:47.580
the fucking injured shoulder.
He,

115
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:51.660
his singing voice is gone and he just fucking at it.
It's just,
I don't know.

116
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.580
All right.
I've,
I've said my piece.
You guys enjoy the fucking fight and uh,
you,

117
00:06:55.581 --> 00:07:00.250
you text me your oh shits and whatnot.
Um,
afterwards,

118
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.430
first he was saying that pill.
It's a spectacle.
It's a spectacle.
It's like,
dude,

119
00:07:05.431 --> 00:07:08.220
I've known you for 10 years.
You've never said that word.

120
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.880
Um,
like they're above it.
Like they're above it.
I'm just watching her.
I,
you know,

121
00:07:14.881 --> 00:07:19.260
I know it's bullshit.
I know.
It's like,
no,
dude,
you can't look away.

122
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.970
That's what's your fucking problem is people who are getting it just because all

123
00:07:23.971 --> 00:07:25.770
we get is going to be so fucking ridiculous.

124
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.240
I this same fucking cons in front of you causing a traffic jam.

125
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.500
Because somebody is changing their tire on the side of the fucking road because

126
00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:37.860
they can't look away and they will write behind all those other costs,

127
00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:41.370
screaming at him,
go,
go,
go,
go drive.
And then the second they come up to it,

128
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.140
they're sitting there fucking rubber neck.

129
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.410
<v 0>All right there.
I'm telling you,</v>

130
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.170
<v 1>you know what the human population is like,</v>

131
00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:51.930
the human population is like a fucking a,

132
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.710
<v 0>okay.</v>

133
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.180
<v 1>You know,
you know those fucking movies that Hollywood always makes,</v>

134
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.620
you know with a white person goes into like the fucking inner city and then goes

135
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:07.420
in and turns everybody's fucking life around and everybody becomes successful in

136
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:12.160
all of those.
Nobody fucks it up.
Right.
That's what the world population is like.

137
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:14.140
It's like that teacher is running shit,

138
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.863
<v 0>you know,</v>

139
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.580
<v 1>can't make the cuts that he needs to make to get down to the fucking real NFL</v>

140
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:26.480
roster.
Does it make any fucking sense?

141
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.160
I'm just saying that it's just too big a heart.

142
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:30.560
I hate those fucking feels fucking movies by the way.

143
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

144
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.940
<v 1>You know,</v>

145
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.780
with a white person goes into the area with his no white people and then save

146
00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:40.470
shit and they never addressed the fact that white people caused the situation.

147
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.980
You know,
and then we turn ourselves into the hero

148
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.080
so then white people can go see the movie.
It'd be like,
damn,

149
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:52.200
that's the white person I be in that scenario.
Well Buddy,

150
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:53.580
you could go fucking do it.

151
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.510
There's plenty of schools that need fucking hero white guy to go down to to try

152
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.710
to help out.
You know what it is right now.

153
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:04.230
I'm fucking on a rant right now just because I fucking,

154
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.030
you know Neil Neil loves those God damn award shows and all of these fucking

155
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:13.230
liberal constant go up on there and they talk about dolphins,
you know,

156
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:14.100
and they blog will blend.

157
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.340
They use their celebrity as a shine a light on it before they go back to their

158
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:21.900
fucking gated community.
It's like,
why don't you get your hands dirty,
you know,

159
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.950
get your hands dirty or shut the fuck up and you're fucking Louis Vuitton

160
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.500
Tuxedo.
Whatever the hell it is you're doing.
Why am I in such a mood?

161
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.190
You know what it is.
I didn't sleep well last night.
And,
uh,
these fucking,

162
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.570
I dunno why this army of bugs bit the shit out of my left ankle.

163
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.300
Um,
and it's on fire and off.
It was a spider.
I don't know what the hell it was,

164
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:49.640
but my whole fucking foot turn red,
you know,

165
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.670
and it's something back in the day before I had a kid,

166
00:09:52.671 --> 00:09:56.270
my wife would help me out with,
but now we have a kid.
So,
you know,

167
00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:59.570
I've gone down on the depth chart,
something like,
Dan,

168
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.840
let's have a look at my fucking foot.
She's like,
Jesus Christ,
I got,

169
00:10:02.841 --> 00:10:05.690
do we have anything for that?
And she's like,
yeah,
I think we do.

170
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

171
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.230
<v 1>That's it.
I'm like,
ah.
Do you know what it is?
Uh,</v>

172
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.340
some aloe fucken Moose,

173
00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:17.360
you can put some Mousse on it.
I Dunno.

174
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.670
So I had been dealing with,
she claims that,
you know,
as you know,

175
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.970
the doctor that she isn't claims that it's getting better.
I Dunno.

176
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.610
All I know is a,
you know,

177
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:32.070
I'm talking to you guys with a really fucking itchy foot,

178
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.900
so maybe that's what it is.
Um,
oh man,
that's going to be fucking exciting.

179
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:39.540
I'm going to actually get to experience what people experience who don't give a

180
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.320
shit about sports on the super bowl.
You get to fucking cruise around the city,

181
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.680
get a bunch of errands done,
you know,

182
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.430
ride a bicycle right down the middle of the street.
Yeah,

183
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.070
this is a bad podcast,
everybody,
if you're not reefing not really aware of it.

184
00:10:56.071 --> 00:11:00.900
At this point,
I started off negative and I wasn't even more negative.
Um,

185
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.490
is anybody else sick of that fucking guy in the Lakers,
dad already?
Jesus Christ.

186
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:08.120
It's like he made it to the NBA.
You're going to get your money.
All right,

187
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.900
enough with the fucking carnival barking.

188
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.520
I would make Michael Jordan cry if I played him one on one.

189
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.910
Was that the weirdest interview?
I just saw a clip of it.

190
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.640
Jimmy Kimmel is literally talking over the guy who,

191
00:11:21.641 --> 00:11:24.870
who's actually going to go into the NBA to talk to the guy who never made it to

192
00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:26.130
the NBA,
who's sitting there.

193
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:28.320
He's talking about how he's going to beat Michael Jordan.

194
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.800
And the other is sitting there like a scolded child that looked like a fucking

195
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:35.050
parents teacher meeting.
[inaudible] um,

196
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.950
tell me that isn't a 30 for 30.

197
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.880
And when he goes to finally make his break from his overbearing father,

198
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.780
um,
all right,
there's another negative thing.
All right,
where else?

199
00:11:47.781 --> 00:11:52.220
Where else can we go with negativity?
You got anything positive to say?
Ah,
yes.

200
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:57.250
I finally have committed to not drinking after false advertising of Billy.

201
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:02.920
No fun months ago.
I can only go three,
four days.

202
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:07.480
I have now put together a run of seven days of come back up from triple.

203
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.430
I'm want a little bit of a heat hitting streak right now and I've gone seven

204
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:16.940
days.
And,
um,
I love it in the morning,

205
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.660
not drinking in the morning is the greatest at night.
It's been,
uh,

206
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.780
it's been a little bit of a,
uh,
you know,

207
00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:26.450
it's a fucking habit I have to break,
but I think,
you know,

208
00:12:26.451 --> 00:12:29.990
once I get up to like seven to 10 days,
then I'm like,
it literally go for a year.

209
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.800
It's weird.
It's just getting to that,
you know,

210
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.400
starting to drop some weight.
I've been jumping on the ellipticals,

211
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.050
uh,

212
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:44.050
I've been fucking working out my a rotator cup feels a little bit better and a,

213
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.810
what I do at night is I just got to go play drums and then I go do a standup set

214
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.320
that a couple of sets last night played some fucking trumps.
And uh,
you know,

215
00:12:51.321 --> 00:12:54.650
it's weird above playing drums or an instrument is the more you learn,

216
00:12:54.651 --> 00:12:59.180
the more you realize you suck.
And it's just really frustrating.
You know,

217
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.360
it's almost like he's just learn everything you can to learn,
stop learning,

218
00:13:02.361 --> 00:13:05.480
get all that shit down.
Considering I'm never going to play in a band.

219
00:13:05.481 --> 00:13:06.950
I'm not going to pursue this professionally.

220
00:13:06.951 --> 00:13:08.750
Then I could actually sit behind a kit and be like,

221
00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:12.890
happy with what I'm fucking doing.
I have learned to tune up a snare.

222
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.710
I can get it sound really good,
but my bass drum sounds like shit,

223
00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:18.920
there's always something.
So he's fucking something.

224
00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:21.380
Let's read some advertising here.
Maybe if I read advertising,

225
00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:25.390
this will get me out of this negative four tech that I've fucking gone into.
Um,

226
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.120
Jesus in 13 and a half minutes.

227
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.430
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

228
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.220
<v 4>just negative.
You know what's funny is what I should really be,</v>

229
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.750
I should really be rooting for this McGregor Mayweather fight to be a great

230
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.910
thing.
Cause then I can,
I can rent it and then,

231
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.860
and I'll get to watch something interesting,

232
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.630
but I'm s I so want to be right about this,
you know,

233
00:13:47.631 --> 00:13:50.840
you're not going to get me right.
I'm the Guy Walking,
you know,

234
00:13:50.841 --> 00:13:52.250
driving by who wants to look,

235
00:13:52.251 --> 00:13:56.300
but I'm not going to look to prove some sort of point that nobody in front of me

236
00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:58.400
behind me or next to me is going to give a shit about,

237
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.100
<v 1>that's basically what I'm doing with this.
Um,</v>

238
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.100
<v 4>anyways,
prediction on the fight.
Yes.
Uh,
I to say Mcgregor's not going to be,</v>

239
00:14:08.101 --> 00:14:09.810
and you know,
I don't know.
It's two years ago.

240
00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:12.750
If he's anything like he used to be Mcgregor's not gonna be able to lay a

241
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:13.710
fucking hand on him.

242
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.890
Why anybody would think that McGregor could lay a fucking glove on Mayweather

243
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:23.860
whether fucking beyond me,
unless they,

244
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.640
unless he got really old in the last two years.

245
00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:29.230
And let's it's Jordan from the bowls to the wizards.
And if,

246
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:32.640
if it's that type of leap,
yes,
Mcgregor has a fucking shot,

247
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.720
but then who gives a shit?
He beats up a fucking guy,
you know,

248
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.250
two years after he retired,

249
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.700
<v 1>you know,
imagine not going to the gym for two years.
Okay.
Then fucking check.</v>

250
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.450
You know,
race and somebody down the street for a fucking mile.

251
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.040
<v 4>Me undies are,
but it'll doe doe beyond ease beyond these.</v>

252
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.540
<v 1>Oh,
bill is a negative con.
Oh dude too.</v>

253
00:14:54.541 --> 00:14:59.540
To be on the shut 'em up if you want.
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.320
A youtube can look good in your underwear and be comfortable.
Right?

255
00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:04.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

256
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.360
<v 1>No,
you want to look good in your underwear.

Legal Zoom,
everybody.</v>

297

It's national.
Make a will month at legal zoom,

298
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.160
and that means it's time to take control of your family and assets.

299
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:23.580
Preparing your family's future is the most important thing you'll do this
summer.

300
00:17:23.581 --> 00:17:28.560
It's the most in fucking thing you could ever do.
All right?
All the time.

301
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:30.090
People die in car accidents.

302
00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:34.170
They drop a heart attacks a fucking piano falls and that God damn had all these

303
00:17:34.171 --> 00:17:35.004
young guys.

304
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:38.550
Their wife fucking nags him to death through an early fucking grave and they do

305
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:41.220
not have a will or a trust or any of that shit.

306
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.190
And then all the fucking evil people show up.

307
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.143
<v 0>Hm,</v>

308
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.550
<v 1>let's start claiming that they were your best friend and they tried to take all</v>

309
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:52.050
your shit and,
and the money away from your kids.
You have to fucking do it.

310
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.830
It's something that guys don't like to do,
dealing with their own mortality,

311
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.650
which is probably why I'm not going to watch Mayweather come in.

312
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.210
The fact that I could actually watch a guy who does not box for a fucking
living,

313
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.530
possibly beat the best boxer of all time.
All that's going to mean is that,
yeah,

314
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:10.290
Bill,
everybody dies.
I don't need to watch that.

315
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.970
I don't need to watch the big three,

316
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.990
the big three coming out there and they're fucking walkers playing each other

317
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:17.250
and nobody can dunk anymore.

318
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.370
I'm sure somebody can dunk their fucking nine feet tall,
but I'm just saying,

319
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.720
all right,
men do not like to deal with that shit.
All right?
But,

320
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.110
uh,
this is,
you got to fame.
You got a fair way,
man.

321
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.860
You got to fucking deal with this stuff.
All right,

That's the guy I did all of this shit.

334
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.170
Okay?
And I didn't want to do it cause I didn't want to deal with me,

335
00:19:14.171 --> 00:19:16.710
Diane and all of this shit.
What do you want to do when you died?

336
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.180
You want to be cremated,
put in the ground and all this shit.
I got to tell you,

337
00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:23.260
when I was done with it,
it was like a weight was off my shoulders and my chest.

338
00:19:23.261 --> 00:19:26.190
I mean,
because every time I'd get on a flight,
you know,

339
00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:28.360
I'd always think of this fucking thing goes down right now.

340
00:19:28.361 --> 00:19:30.670
What's going to happen to my wife and kid?
You know what I mean?

That's legalzoom.com/prepare all right,

344
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.290
now it's time to talk about my real feelings about them.
Mayweather,

345
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:55.580
Mcgregor fight.
I am curious.
I do want to watch,

346
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.030
but I've just been burned too many fucking times.

347
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.570
So what I'm doing is I'm letting you guys take the beach.
All right?

348
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.480
And if you tweet at me all my God,
that was fucking amazing.

349
00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:10.010
[inaudible] going to lie to me.

350
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:13.130
I'll go on the internet and if everybody said that was amazing and it was worth

351
00:20:13.131 --> 00:20:17.360
the fucking money,
I will then rent the fight.
That's what I'm doing from now on.

352
00:20:17.361 --> 00:20:20.600
Cause I've just,
I've just been burned too many fucking times.
Um,

353
00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:24.110
I think it will be devastating for boxing if Mayweather loses,

354
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.640
even though he's been retired for two fucking years.
Um,

355
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.180
basically it's all about the first couple of rounds.

356
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.860
If Mcgregor's going to do it,
if he doesn't do it within fucking three rounds,

357
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.790
he's fucked.
That's it.
Okay.
There's my brilliant insight.

358
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.410
I know what everybody else knows.

359
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.780
I have to watch too many McGregor's fights any imminent.

360
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.290
When he would fight Nate,
he get into the fourth round and he would be winded.

361
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:53.410
So they fight five minute rounds.
So I didn't,
I don't know.

362
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.310
I think even though they only fight what,

363
00:20:57.311 --> 00:21:00.490
how many [inaudible] how many minutes or there's a three minute rounds,
right?

364
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.930
So logically you'd be the,
well,
five minutes in then,

365
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:08.500
then that's the equivalent to go in five rounds.
I mean,
three rounds,

366
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.530
five minute rounds in the fucking UFC.
Jesus Christ belt.
But here's the thing,

367
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:14.140
he's going to be using different muscles.
You know,

368
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.760
he's going to waste a lot of fucking energy trying to hit somebody that nobody

369
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:20.950
could fucking hit.
And um,

370
00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.160
I dunno,
I dunno what it is,
but they're both brilliant fucking fighters,
stip,

371
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:31.130
both amazing.
And,
uh,
they're also,
you know,
they're as good at selling a fight,

372
00:21:31.131 --> 00:21:34.580
which is why everybody's showing up in all of that shit because too big shit

373
00:21:34.581 --> 00:21:36.260
talkers,
you know,

374
00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.410
there's nothing people like better than seeing a shit talker lose and one of

375
00:21:39.411 --> 00:21:41.810
them's going to lose.
So I guess that's why everybody's going to watch,

376
00:21:41.811 --> 00:21:44.040
but I cannot fucking resist.

377
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.083
<v 0>Okay.</v>

378
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:46.571
<v 1>D,
uh,</v>

379
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:51.070
the euphoria of not doing what everybody else is doing and getting to do other

380
00:21:51.071 --> 00:21:51.904
shit.

381
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.270
It's something I learned when I would watch the super bowl and I would just take

382
00:21:55.271 --> 00:22:00.190
the fucking thing
and just do other shit for the first 90 minutes of the game.

383
00:22:00.191 --> 00:22:04.600
So I can fast forward through all of the commercials and the absolutely fucking

384
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:09.100
horrific halftime show and the opening ceremonies and all of that other
bullshit.

385
00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:10.750
And I could just watch the Goddamn game.

386
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:13.240
I remember when I would drive around and go,
you know,

387
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.420
<v 0>okay,</v>

388
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.810
<v 1>get something to eat or some shit and they'd just be nobody on the fucking road.</v>

389
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:24.090
And you just get to experience what you city was like back before there were

390
00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:28.890
automobiles sub,
you're in a car and there's paved roads.

391
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.070
I Dunno,
there's this sort of a,
uh,

392
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:37.310
I kind of understand a little bit like why people don't watch sports.

393
00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.990
I actually get it now like the amount of free time and if you like,

394
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.020
but the thing is is you've got to fill that free time up.

395
00:22:46.021 --> 00:22:47.640
It was like some healthy shit.
Oh,

396
00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:50.610
this is like a nice ying and Yang total negative.
Now I'm going to go positive.

397
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.540
Just imagine.

398
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

399
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.900
<v 1>First of all,
a the food you wouldn't eat.
All right?</v>

400
00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.440
All the extra time you'd have to work out.
You know,

401
00:23:00.441 --> 00:23:02.930
if you always wanted to learn how to play guitar and learn how to speak a

402
00:23:02.931 --> 00:23:07.310
language,
the amount of time you spend,
you know,

403
00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.240
I can't say wasting your time because you enjoy it.
I fucking enjoy it.
Right.

404
00:23:11.241 --> 00:23:14.840
If you're a sports fan,
but just think of everything that you could accomplish.

405
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.790
I remember like one of the first times the NFL went on strike in my life

406
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.930
and they went in and when it would come back,
you know,

407
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:27.540
they showed a couple people on the news and I don't know if they were lying or

408
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:29.880
whatever.
They were just like,
yeah man,
you know,
I'm Kinda,

409
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:35.690
it was Kinda cool to have like Saturday and Sunday in the fall to myself.

410
00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:39.150
I can hang out with my kids.
I can go do some shit.

411
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.470
I just don't give a fuck anymore.
Um,

412
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.780
<v 0>okay.</v>

413
00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.090
<v 1>I don't know.
This weird part of me.</v>

414
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.890
<v 0>I can't stop watching it then.
This is part of me that I wish I,</v>

415
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.100
I wish I could do it.
But then you just fill it up with something else dumb.

416
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.630
Then it become one of those what comic con people

417
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.030
<v 1>that knows the actor's name that crunched down in that r two d two fucking
thing.</v>

418
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.780
That little fucking trash compactor that he was riding around in.

419
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.750
I Dunno.
Do you know what all of this shit,
it's,
it's bigger than me.

420
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.410
I have no idea what any of these fucking shit means.
Enjoy.
You got damn fight.

421
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:17.980
Don't let's do a crabby freckled bald cont like me telling you that it's a

422
00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:22.060
fucking rip off you go enjoy your goddamn spectacle.
Yeah.
You deserve it.

423
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.070
It's a spectacle.
Donald Trump isn't enough of a fucking spectacle.

424
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.450
That's not enough for you,
Jesus Christ.

425
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.860
Do you know I don't even,
I don't even fuck that.
That's something like,

426
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.890
I pay attention to that.
I don't pay attention to that.

427
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:45.980
The way somebody does who doesn't give a fuck about sports pays attention to it.

428
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.510
Um,

429
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.220
the fact that our president tweets and reads is his Twitter account.

430
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.400
It's just,
I don't,
I don't even know like,

431
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.580
<v 0>okay.</v>

432
00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.200
<v 1>It's like,
dude,
you were above that.</v>

433
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:01.403
<v 0>You're above it.</v>

434
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.100
<v 1>Fucking respond.
I don't,
you don't meet people shit on me.
I don't even,
I feel,</v>

435
00:25:06.101 --> 00:25:08.590
I don't even need to respond to people shitting on me.
I,
first of all,

436
00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:11.560
I feel it's par for the course.
Not Everybody's going to like you.

437
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.610
The fact that this fucking guy's got to go on and responsive.
What are you doing?

438
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.210
But then again,
he did win it.
He won that.
He won the whole fucking,

439
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.760
I love people who think he's dumb.

440
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.400
It's like if he's that fucking stupid.

441
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:29.320
How did all those smart people lose to them?

442
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.100
That was like back in the day when that the woman Jessica Simpson,

443
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:37.640
when she would be like chicken of the sea.
Is that like chicken or is it tuna?

444
00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.323
<v 0>Okay.</v>

445
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.240
<v 1>Which to be honest,
looking back was a legit question.</v>

446
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.400
I mean it is a food and he wrote chicken on it.

447
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:49.590
That's like chicken fried steak for years though.
So is it chicken is at stake.

448
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:50.550
What the fuck is it?

449
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.740
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

450
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.450
<v 1>Hey,
take a ride in my truck car.
What the fuck is it?</v>

451
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.560
Why would you call it something else when it says,
um,

452
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.970
everybody thought she was dumb.
It's like,
yeah.
Yeah.
She's a fucking moron with,

453
00:26:05.971 --> 00:26:09.840
with hit albums in our own TV shows.
Like,
I would love to be that stupid.

454
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:11.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

455
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:16.030
<v 1>You know she married Nicholas Shea.
He's a good looking fella,
right guys.</v>

456
00:26:16.031 --> 00:26:19.810
Guys in a boy band.
He plays golf on the fucking weekend.
She was crushing it.

457
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.130
Date and Tony Romo.
Robo Robo.

458
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:29.630
Did she marry him?
I don't know.
I feel bad for a one day.
Like,

459
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.000
I think it was her.
She,
her little dog,
you know,

460
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.380
like last seen in the mouth of a coyote.
It's like,
yeah,
it's fucking dead.

461
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

462
00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.270
<v 1>What do you think the coyotes have like some sort of terrorist group and they're</v>

463
00:26:42.271 --> 00:26:46.020
going to fucking you UB duck your dog and change it's fucking mindset.

464
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.410
It's going to be like the patty Hearst to fucking chihuahuas.
No,
it's,
it's,

465
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:50.244
it's dead.

466
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.690
That's why you got to get a big dog out here.

467
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.170
You got to have a big dog that liked the other coyotes or like,
you know what,

468
00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:02.340
it's not fucking worth it.
You know what I mean?
Like for dogs out here,

469
00:27:02.341 --> 00:27:05.340
this is like going to fucking Rikers island.
All right,

470
00:27:05.341 --> 00:27:09.660
well you need a big need to be a big fucking muscular goddamn dog.

471
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:13.800
You need to be more of a fucking problem.
Then these little fellas out here,

472
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:16.950
these little dogs like,
I dunno what people do,

473
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:20.100
like they fucking leave him in their backyards and shit and they just,

474
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:24.740
they just did gone.
They're gone.
It's like,

475
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.480
it's like literally like one of those creepy fucking movies.

476
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.790
You know where they would,
you know,

477
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.300
the people would go to an island and they were just living with some sort of

478
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:38.301
dragon or some sort of gorilla and they would just sacrifice somebody like King

479
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.640
Kong and that type of shits of this fucking thing,
but leave him alone.

480
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.040
That's such a weird beginning,
Huh?
To the King Kong movie,

481
00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:51.280
that poor woman's like tied up with those fucking vines and I just don't get

482
00:27:51.281 --> 00:27:55.510
like,
okay,
you got a 60 foot God damn gorilla.

483
00:27:55.511 --> 00:27:57.190
He's going to eat that fucking won

484
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.630
one person and they'd be like filled up.
That's going to be like Doritos,
right?

485
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.710
Well not Doritos because we're mostly fucking,
you know,
protein and shit.

486
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.130
We're kind of a protein snack.

487
00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:13.180
We right till that's like Kymab and like a Clif bar.

488
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.390
Goddamn 60 foot is going to eat one clif bar every couple of months and then be

489
00:28:19.391 --> 00:28:23.650
fine.
First of all,
I didn't think gorillas,
I thought they were vegetarians,

490
00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.710
right?
I thought they sat around just fucking eating.

491
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.830
I don't know what the hell they,

492
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.250
there's always some fucking person got to go try and live with them and get a

493
00:28:33.251 --> 00:28:34.990
little closer and a little closer

494
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.110
and then eventually get the shit kicked out of them

495
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.480
by the God damn gorilla.
I gotta tell you,
man,

496
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:49.280
the amount of shit that a gorilla we'll put up with it because it's as big as it

497
00:28:49.281 --> 00:28:50.114
is.

498
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.800
I wonder if a gorilla has ever fought like a tiger and for that we need to go to

499
00:28:58.801 --> 00:28:59.634
Asia.

500
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:05.280
You know you want to talk about spectacles where you have a boxer against an MMA

501
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:09.180
guy,
like agents.
I'm telling you,
if you want to go see any,

502
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:12.690
anytime you start looking at like this versus this,
this versus that,

503
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.430
you will find black and white footage where they put a fucking bear and a tiger

504
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.170
in the same cage to see what our line,

505
00:29:20.171 --> 00:29:24.460
we're against the tire just to see what the fuck would happen.
Um,

506
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.010
they did it.

507
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.440
<v 0>That's their thing</v>

508
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.910
<v 1>where we experimented with human beings.
They experimented with animals.</v>

509
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.200
It seems I don't fuck why,
what am I even talking?
But you know,

510
00:29:36.201 --> 00:29:39.680
this is one of these podcasts where it just started off on the wrong foot head.

511
00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:43.660
Now I'm just desperately trying fill the last 18 seconds of this thing so I can

512
00:29:43.661 --> 00:29:48.661
get up to fucking my contractually obligated 30 minutes.

513
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:52.330
How about those red sox aren't taking two out of three at a Teray.

514
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.940
Terry Francona is fucking a team there.
The Cleveland Indians,

515
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:04.480
um,
piling up the fucking numbers there.
I haven't been keeping up on what the,

516
00:30:04.481 --> 00:30:05.470
uh,
the Yankees are doing.

517
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:07.680
So why don't I try to end this thing on something positive?

518
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:12.160
You guys enjoy your fight,
your sports spectacle.
This,
uh,
this weekend,

519
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:15.670
I hope you don't get fucked over.
And I'm,
I'm being honest.
You know something.

520
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:18.370
I'm going to be a bigger man here rather than being the guy that said,

521
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:19.090
I told you so.

522
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.420
I hope on Monday you guys can all come back and I can read a bunch of fucking

523
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:26.500
letters of like,
Bill,
you negative cont you've never been wrong.

524
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.010
More wrong in your freckled pathetic life.
And a,

525
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:32.860
I really hope that you guys are able to send those to me.
I hope you make it.

526
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.510
Hope you get your money's worth.
Um,
like I said,

527
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:42.190
I will not be watching the fucking thing.
Um,
I'm too God damn stubborn.

528
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.480
All right.
I,
you know something,
I'm actually,
this is,
this is actually for me,

529
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.660
this pay per view is about being able to walk away because I've jumped on the

530
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:55.540
fucking,
you know,
the UFC has done that to me.

531
00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:58.240
You have [inaudible] I've ordered the fucking shit and then find out somebody

532
00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:01.420
tested positive for steroids.
You know,

533
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.550
UFC is also doing that shit now.

534
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.360
Now that they got bought out by other fucking people,
you know,

535
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:09.610
and Dana White's like the figurehead.
No.
However,
the,

536
00:31:09.611 --> 00:31:12.220
how the fuck it works that doing that shit.
Now we're like,

537
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:14.440
every three pounds is a new way class.

538
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.080
So now they have all these air quote champions.

539
00:31:17.081 --> 00:31:19.300
So then everything's a fucking championship fight.

540
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:23.770
That's like what fucking killed boxing aside from the fact that they had like 50

541
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:27.010
different goddamn leagues or whatever,

542
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.870
the WBA,
the WBC,
the IBF,

543
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:34.810
they was like three heavyweight champions all at the same time.

544
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:39.340
And then somebody had to try to come in and unify the titles.
Um,

545
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.620
yeah.
And like then,
like every,

546
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:44.380
like eight pounds became like a fucking weight class or whatever.

547
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.570
I only know it was,
everything was like a title fight and they were,

548
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.950
they weren't as good.
So I hope to,
UFC doesn't go that route because,
um,

549
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.270
what was great when they had the monopoly was a,
the best fought,

550
00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:57.470
the best soil.
Hope that continues.
Um,

551
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.750
I apologize for this podcast everybody.

552
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:04.390
I don't know why I'm shitting on everything.
That's just fun.

553
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.710
Simple God damn fun in this miserable world.
Why would I do that?
All right,

554
00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:10.390
come on bill.
Pull it out of the mud.

555
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.980
This fight is going to be the greatest spectacle of all time.

556
00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:19.690
If you do not put $60 down on that,
you are going to miss out,
right?

557
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.810
There you go.
That was positive.
What do you want from me?
I tried,

558
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:30.880
I tried.
I got an Itchy foot and my fucking body is like reacting to the fact,

559
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.640
you know,
if anyone else is,
um,
a couple of my friends,
uh,

560
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.800
became parents,
right?
So what I always do,

561
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.240
my gift that I do is I go out and I buy a nice,
cute,

562
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.630
cool pair of fucking sneakers,
right?

563
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.360
Little Jordans will uptown's whatever the fuck you want,
right?

564
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.390
That's what I get for the kid.
Okay.

565
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:58.280
And then I get to sick bottles of fucking booze for the parents.
You know,

566
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.710
because here's the deal.
Everybody's,

567
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.050
I think I already told you the day everybody's going to go out and go buy a

568
00:33:03.051 --> 00:33:05.720
stuffed fucking animal,
this fucking thing.

569
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:07.670
And it's just going to be this thing that the parents,

570
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800
the kid can't fucking use it.

571
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:14.030
It's a baby to Goddamn blob that you carry around for fucking three months.

572
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.730
All right.
And then when we finally can move around,

573
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.960
it Wa it doesn't give a shit about toys.
All right?

574
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.130
It likes extension cords.
It likes pots and pans.

575
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.750
It likes you just any fucking thing that it shouldn't be touching.

576
00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:34.010
That's what it wants.
And he could give a fuck about the Goddamn toys.

577
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.650
Buying a toy for a baby is the biggest,

578
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.920
it's a bigger waste of money than buying this Conor McGregor Mayweather fight

579
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:48.500
this weekend.
I just can't get out of it.
People.
Um,

580
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.980
I feel like the libertarian this weekend,
you know,

581
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:56.420
is actually addressing the problem with a Democrat and the Republican would back

582
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:59.300
one of the two candidates and act like it's going to change your life and that

583
00:33:59.301 --> 00:34:00.740
this was going to be a good thing for you.

584
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:05.070
And I'm the fucking the fucking Green party guy going,
hey man,
he's bankers.

585
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.670
<v 5>You over me and everybody's bought and paid for me.</v>

586
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:11.883
<v 1>MMM.</v>

587
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.280
<v 5>You want a Brussels sprout and of account of sandwich man.</v>

588
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:17.843
Um,

589
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.260
<v 1>but the parents,
everybody fee immediately,
immediately.</v>

590
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.160
Now that you have a kid like you,

591
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.000
you go down on the depth chart and nobody gives a shit about you.

592
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.980
Everybody cares about the kid.
Right?
Which is great.
That's the way it should be.

593
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:36.120
But if you actually do something for the parents,
okay.

594
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.360
And actually acknowledged that they are individuals with hopes and dreams that

595
00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:46.980
have now been dashed because all of their focus is now going on the baby,

596
00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:48.120
which is the way it should be.

597
00:34:48.121 --> 00:34:53.040
But every once in a while you've got to throw him a fucking needle ginger snap

598
00:34:53.041 --> 00:34:56.190
there.
Right.
So that's what I do.
I go out,

599
00:34:56.191 --> 00:35:01.191
I buy a sick ass bottle of booze and a nice bottle for the guy in a fucking nice

600
00:35:01.321 --> 00:35:06.270
bottle of Rozay for the lady.
And then I just get the kid a pair of shoes,

601
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.231
sneakers,

602
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:10.890
cool sneakers for when the kids walk in and they can actually use those things,

603
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.600
you know,
as opposed to some stupid fucking thing.

604
00:35:15.601 --> 00:35:18.180
You know that they're supposed to reach up and grab whatever the fuck it is.

605
00:35:18.181 --> 00:35:20.670
That's what I do.
Okay,
there you go.

606
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.920
Anyways,
fucking,
I got like the hiccups,

607
00:35:25.921 --> 00:35:28.560
my foot itches and I'm off the sauce.

608
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.640
I'm off to sauce and I'm going back to Boston this week and I'm staying off the

609
00:35:32.641 --> 00:35:37.630
sauce.
I had been working out and I'm staying off the fucking sauce.
Um,

610
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:41.760
I already,
I already had the conversations in my head.
I'm not fucking doing it.

611
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:45.030
I'm going to go on a nice,
nice run here.

612
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.340
I am a committed to it.
I'm dropping some fucking pounds.
So that's it.
Um,

613
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.530
enjoy your guys' fight this weekend.
I hope you get your money's worth.

614
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:58.430
I've said that 50 times trying to make up for the fucking previous negative 30

615
00:35:58.711 --> 00:36:03.090
minutes.
Uh,
that's the podcast for this Thursday afternoon.
Have a great weekend.

616
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:03.871
You constant joy.

617
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:08.490
This music and then we got to throw back podcasts.

618
00:36:08.491 --> 00:36:12.120
Mothers' Thursday,
I dunno,
from last year,
the year before,

619
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:13.710
maybe a couple of weeks ago.
Who knows.
All right,

620
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.443
<v 6>I'll see you later.</v>

621
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.390
<v 8>Watching the whites of your eyes to the</v>

622
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.173
world.

623
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.750
He's been reading some
thing.

624
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.960
How much you change all the money

625
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.640
back those days.
Yep.

626
00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.260
<v 6>All right.
Girlfriend in fantasy league.</v>

627
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:02.520
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

628
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.650
<v 6>Hey Bill,
love the podcast.
I'll put up the,
thank you.</v>

629
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.050
I've been in a fantasy football league for 10 years.

630
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.820
It was started by one of my best friends and has been the same 12 guys for a

631
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.010
decade.
I don't even know how bands had put,
uh,

632
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.320
I don't even know bands that have been together that long.

633
00:38:16.321 --> 00:38:20.310
So this year my buddy who started the league decided to boot out to lifelong

634
00:38:20.311 --> 00:38:22.320
members in favor of his girlfriend

635
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.470
<v 8>and the girlfriend</v>

636
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.130
<v 6>of a friend of ours.</v>

637
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.760
<v 8>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait.</v>

638
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.710
<v 6>Sit.
Those other two guys who got booted,
did they anything,</v>

639
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:37.950
<v 3>okay.</v>

640
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.580
<v 6>Um,
if he was going to add the ladies,
why did those other two guys have to leave?</v>

641
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

642
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:47.410
<v 6>Wow.
All right.
Okay.
Well I'm sucked into this story.</v>

643
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:52.090
He said I immediately called Bullshit and said point blank to his face and she

644
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:55.810
wasn't sucking your Dick then she wouldn't be in the league.
Uh,
dude,

645
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.730
that right there is a game changer.
You can't say,
what if he marries this woman?

646
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.780
Always.
There's a roofie guys.

647
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.950
Always be careful what you say about the woman you're guy is with.

648
00:39:07.951 --> 00:39:10.950
Cause you never fucking know.
You never know.

649
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:13.890
And I'm sure there's some listeners that have stories and if you'd like to

650
00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:16.890
contribute them to the podcast where uh,

651
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.710
you know it's even fucking worse is when

652
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.640
your buddy,
he says fucked up shit about the girl.

653
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.320
You know about what a horse she is in bed and she's fucking his brains out,

654
00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:30.240
but blah,
blah blah,
blah,

655
00:39:30.241 --> 00:39:35.241
Blah and tells you all these these details and then the jackass ends up falling

656
00:39:36.281 --> 00:39:39.700
for and then he has to fucking break up with you because he's not going to break

657
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:44.370
up with her because every time he looks at you he thinks out.
You know,
he,

658
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.560
he knows how this girl,
my future wife's sucks my Dick,
you know.

659
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.440
Anyways,
plowing ahead.

660
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.230
He's trying to defend this decision by saying she at least knows a little about

661
00:39:56.231 --> 00:39:59.050
sports.
So this is awful.

662
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

663
00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.830
<v 6>This guy wasn't raised right,
man.
This is just,
this is fucking terrible.</v>

664
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.450
You said the fact of the matter is that she is from New York and knows who the

665
00:40:08.451 --> 00:40:12.800
jets are.
That's the extent of her football knowledge.
He thinks I'm overreacting,

666
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.030
not overreacting.

667
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.610
<v 3>Okay.</v>

668
00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.050
<v 6>He didn't ask anybody else.</v>

669
00:40:18.051 --> 00:40:23.030
You've had 12 for the last 10 years and he just removed two of the original band

670
00:40:23.031 --> 00:40:23.864
members,

671
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.910
so this isn't even funny.
This is,
this is really upsetting to me.

672
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.920
He thinks I'm overreacting,
but I think of it the same scenario.
If you had,

673
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.210
if you have one night a year to have a guy's night with your buddies and then he

674
00:40:39.211 --> 00:40:39.871
gets to the bar,

675
00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:44.070
you see that your friend has invited his girlfriend to guys night.
Exactly.

676
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.000
Even told me that she,
she's the one who asked if she could join,

677
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.140
which obviously to me means he had no intentions of inviting her,

678
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.820
but when he was backed into the corner,

679
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.870
his ball shot up into his throat and he couldn't say no.
Exactly.

680
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.780
It's not just a fantasy league,

681
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.380
but a clear indication that she's going to slowly start chipping away at

682
00:41:04.381 --> 00:41:07.530
everything else in the rest of his life.
Exactly.
In summation,

683
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.890
his girlfriend wanted in and he crumbled and said,
yes.

684
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.920
Am I reading too much into this?
Am I overreacting?

685
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:17.040
I'd like to know because he's getting pissed at me for being pissed at him.

686
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:21.330
Absolutely not,
sir.
Everything that I was going to tell you,
you already know.

687
00:41:21.331 --> 00:41:25.230
And you wrote in this email,
okay?
You ran down the mats,

688
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.130
you went off the little fucking springboard.
Do you hit the fucking hobby horse?

689
00:41:29.131 --> 00:41:33.030
You dead.
Your little fucking Mary Lou Leighton Flip and you stuck the landing.

690
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:37.460
You get a perfect 10 on that one,
sir.
You are 100% right.

691
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.050
You know what you want.
My move would be,
I would start my own fantasy league.

692
00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.450
All right?
And I would invite everybody else in that fucking leak.
Well,

693
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:51.950
I wouldn't do that cause now that's,
that's a chick move.
Make people decide,

694
00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.900
oh,
this is what I,
I wouldn't be as harsh with him and just be like,
no.

695
00:41:57.901 --> 00:42:00.270
Do what you did was absolute bullshit.
And I guarantee you,

696
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.180
I would tell them that she's going to start chipping away with you and your
life.

697
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.850
Your balls are up in your throat.
Um,

698
00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:11.820
but that's going to end your friendship with them.
But here's the deal,
dude.

699
00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.980
There are other fantasy football leagues.

700
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.253
<v 8>Did join.</v>

701
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.340
<v 6>All right.
And uh,
that,
that's one of those ugly things about</v>

702
00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.120
that chapter of guys lives after,
um,
college.

703
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:29.501
You know,

704
00:42:29.501 --> 00:42:32.980
when you went to grade school together or you met them and call up guys in

705
00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:35.830
college or whatever,
but you guys have this unbelievable bond,

706
00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.290
like you went to fucking war together.

707
00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.043
<v 8>MMM.</v>

708
00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.620
<v 6>If one of your friends is a pussy,</v>

709
00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.740
you know,
he has,
um,

710
00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.510
he has a chance of meeting somebody who's going to splinter that group.
You know,

711
00:42:52.511 --> 00:42:53.860
and this isn't an anti woman thing,

712
00:42:53.861 --> 00:42:58.540
this is more like an anti pussy guy kind of thing where raw,
you know,

713
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:03.100
there are controlling,
suffocating people on both sides.
Men and women.

714
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.900
And I know that there's women listening and they've,

715
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.550
one of their best girlfriend started dating some fucking overbearing,

716
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.610
insecure Douche bag guy.

717
00:43:12.611 --> 00:43:15.910
And the first thing they do is they cut them off from their friends and then

718
00:43:15.911 --> 00:43:18.700
it's the coworkers,
then the friends and then their family,

719
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.820
they stick them under a fucking
little glass or something.
So,

720
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.200
uh,
yeah,
you know what dude?
You're the worst.

721
00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:32.650
The sad thing is,
is you're going to lose a couple of friends.

722
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.550
Sometimes that happens and a,
you just have to be content about it.
And

723
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:38.771
you know,

724
00:43:38.771 --> 00:43:43.420
and I think it's really important for men and women to have men only and women

725
00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:48.421
only social events that they can go to once a week or a couple of times a month

726
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.790
and just hang out with the fellows and hang out with the ladies.
It just,

727
00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.780
whatever.
I think it's really,
really healthy.

728
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.210
It's gives you something to look forward to.

729
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:06.820
It gives you a place where you could just vent about your anything you fucking

730
00:44:06.821 --> 00:44:11.110
want.
And in a group of people,
that 100% is going to understand it.

731
00:44:11.111 --> 00:44:14.230
You don't have to worry about hurting anybody's feelings or offending on
anybody.

732
00:44:14.231 --> 00:44:16.600
I think it's true.
It's really,
really fucking healthy.

733
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.360
And this guy's fucking with that.
And uh,
and he didn't put it to a vote.

734
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.920
What is he?
The Grand Poobah this shit.
I Dunno.

735
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.080
There's so many ways you can go with that to spending,

736
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.150
depending on how much you want to stir up the pot.

737
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.580
You guys should put it to the vote.
This,
it'd be great.
Put it to a vote.
Do it.

738
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.540
Have this be like you're Arab spring,

739
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.860
but with a fantasy football league and just fault that cunt out and then you

740
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:48.410
become the dictator and you move into the palace.
How about that?
What happened?

741
00:44:48.411 --> 00:44:50.760
Dude,
you're 100% right.
I would just,

742
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:52.920
I would choose my words a little more carefully.

743
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.730
Don't say that you didn't have the balls.
Just say,
listen,

744
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.530
this was something that we did together for 12 years and

745
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.483
<v 7>uh,</v>

746
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.500
<v 6>I'm really disappointed and shocked that you made this big a move and remove two</v>

747
00:45:08.571 --> 00:45:12.500
other members and didn't include anybody else.
It,

748
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.820
I don't think that it was done right and I think we should put this to a vote.

749
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.200
That's what we should do.
And if he gets mad and he starts yelling,

750
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.070
don't lose your cool.

751
00:45:22.071 --> 00:45:26.270
Just keep stating your opinion calmly and you know,

752
00:45:26.271 --> 00:45:28.370
if he's going to be a bitch about it,
let it be a bitch about it.

753
00:45:28.371 --> 00:45:30.650
And I would actually,
for your own health,

754
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.770
did she already thinks she knows is the jet she's gonna be like,
wait a minute.

755
00:45:35.771 --> 00:45:36.140
Who is this

756
00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.960
<v 4>fat?
I have my God,
I don't know anything.
She's</v>

757
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.083
<v 6>try to do that.</v>

758
00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.730
You know that thing where women try to act like they're dumb because they think

759
00:45:42.731 --> 00:45:47.460
it's cute.
You know what I would do,
sir?

760
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:52.160
I would just plant your losses just fucking with,
I don't know.

761
00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:52.951
The more I think about it,

762
00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:55.530
the more noise I'm getting to just ruined my fucking day and I'm not even in it.

763
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.550
I don't even like fantasy football.

764
00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.123
<v 7>Cool.</v>

765
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:42.460
<v 4>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast.</v>

766
00:46:42.461 --> 00:46:46.680
So Monday,
August 24th,
2009.

767
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.060
How the hell are you,
uh,
another week going by.
I got a big week coming up here.

768
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:51.841
Really excited.

769
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:56.841
I'm actually going to Sweden this week and I really wanted to read a lot about

770
00:46:59.671 --> 00:47:03.960
Sweden.
I want him to know a couple of the phrases,
you know,

771
00:47:03.961 --> 00:47:05.910
the ones that you need to know.
Uh,

772
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.070
something about where can I get something to eat?

773
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:11.850
How to say thank you and how to say,
dude,
do me a favor.

774
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:14.070
Why don't you get the fuck away from me?
You know,

775
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.610
cause you're kind of freaking me out.
I mean,
you need,

776
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:24.150
you need to know how to say that in every language and your real,

777
00:47:24.151 --> 00:47:28.950
that's the one that you really need to memorize.
Okay?
So you can,

778
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:33.320
it was some feeling,
you know what I mean?
You can't be like,
ah Dude,

779
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:38.600
get the fuck me away.
You know,
you,

780
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.800
you gotta you gotta you just gotta come.
I dude,
get the fuck away from me.

781
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:45.280
I'm serious.
I'm not kidding.
Get the fuck away from it.
He got to,

782
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:48.980
you'd have to know how to say that.
And I have no idea.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

783
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.480
All I know about Sweden is that fucking puppet on a,
the muppet show.

784
00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.070
Remember that one?

785
00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:58.070
<v 10>Borghi [inaudible] Borg who are Geeky dish mortgage ED board</v>

786
00:47:58.610 --> 00:47:59.520
<v 4>workbook.</v>

787
00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.760
<v 10>Here we have to heat ish.
Muti</v>

788
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.530
<v 4>remember that.
That's all I know.
You know,
is it Sweden?</v>

789
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:09.910
The one where they cross country ski to school.
I know Hitler.

790
00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:13.690
You still look at it across the waters.
Start jerking off,

791
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.780
wishing he was blond and blue eyed.
You know

792
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.980
the fucking poor bastard.
Not only did he not,
well,

793
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:25.180
not only was he not blonde and blue eyed,
he couldn't even get a chance.
He just,

794
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:27.580
he couldn't,
his girlfriend wasn't even blonde and blue eyed.

795
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:31.510
You know what I mean?
I'm going to put this out here at LACC.

796
00:48:31.511 --> 00:48:34.380
I know there's been a ton of shit out there on Hitler.
Um,

797
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.660
I'm going to put this out here.
This is a theory that I have.

798
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:41.200
I think Hitler had no game with women.
You know,

799
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.720
women don't like angry guys.
Psychos do psychos,
like hangry guys.
You know,

800
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.370
I was actually talking to this bird last night and she was saying how,

801
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.790
I don't know what the fuck her boyfriend does buy it.
Ah,

802
00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.710
she was saying up until this point,
like the guy she's dating now,

803
00:48:56.711 --> 00:49:01.711
this is the first time she's a not dated someone who's a musician and she was

804
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:05.490
just high.
And I just always like musicians.
The Oh,

805
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:09.040
the passion they have on stage and they're crazy.
And your guy,
your guy.

806
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.100
And I was really sitting there listening to her.
She described dating musician.

807
00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:15.220
I realized that at,
for a female,
that's the,

808
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.890
that's the female equivalent of a dating.

809
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:22.030
A stripper is if you date a musician,
it's the same fucking thing.
You know,

810
00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.220
they're on stage,
they're sweaty,
they're on drugs,

811
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.850
they're bad with money.
And in the end you have to take care of them.

812
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.120
You got ended up being a fucking parent.
Wow.
That's really fucking came together,

813
00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:38.710
doesn't it?
Jesus Christ.
It's not bad.
It's not bad.
Right?
Cleo,

814
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.920
look at Jesus Christ.
Um,
anyways,
uh,
let's plow ahead here.
We've got it.

815
00:49:43.921 --> 00:49:46.480
We've got a lot of shit.
So anyways,
I had this,
this,
this great week.

816
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.140
I did this benefit.
How funny is this?
Cause,
uh,

817
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.890
if you guys listened to my podcast last week,

818
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:55.210
I had that incident with that woman from the humane society,
right?

819
00:49:55.211 --> 00:49:57.850
So this week talk about irony.

820
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:02.940
I actually had a gig where I was doing a benefit for a four rescue dogs and it

821
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:07.930
was kind of the usual thing where I'm sitting in my head going,
fuck,

822
00:50:07.931 --> 00:50:12.130
I hate doing benefits.
I can't stand to a benefit.
My Act,
I don't want it.

823
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.430
I don't have any jokes that do well at benefits.
I just don't,

824
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:16.301
there's always like,

825
00:50:16.301 --> 00:50:20.980
they always put me on and there's a bunch of Nice comics in front of me or even

826
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:22.780
if they're not nice,
that be a nice,

827
00:50:22.781 --> 00:50:26.860
and then I go up there and I try to be nice and you guys all know I'm a cunt.

828
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.270
So,
you know,
you can't,

829
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.980
I can't get that conti tone out of my voice and I just always end up feeling

830
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:38.480
crass and ignorant.
I just,
I hate doing them.
Right.

831
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.280
But fortunately,
this was actually a great gig.
And the,
uh,

832
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:47.600
the dude host and the show,
you know,
he was bringing up all these,
uh,

833
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:53.030
the celebrity people.
And,
uh,
I don't know if I should tell this story,

834
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:56.900
but I'm gonna just cause I don't think that many people listen to this podcast.

835
00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:00.710
One of the people who went up there was a,

836
00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:06.050
was Priscilla Presley,
you know,
uh,
Elvis's girlfriend,

837
00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.270
wife or whatever and all that type of stuff.
So she's up there talking about how,

838
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:15.680
uh,
some ridiculous amount of puppies every year get killed,

839
00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.210
you know,

840
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:21.890
at shelters and get put down like over a million puppies every year above and

841
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:24.620
says really serious moment.
And you know,
she was dressed,

842
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:26.840
she looked beautiful and everything.
And,
uh,

843
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:33.320
I'm standing back there with another couple of people and,

844
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:38.100
uh,
Geez,
I really shouldn't tell this story because it involves other people.

845
00:51:38.101 --> 00:51:42.240
Okay,
fuck it.
This is what comics do in that situation as everyone else.

846
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.440
All you normal people who can get married and fucking have emotions and shit.

847
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:51.690
You know,
when you get all welled up as this icon is talking about dead puppies,

848
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:56.430
uh,
we were in the back going,
hey dude,

849
00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.950
she sucked to Elvis's Dick

850
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.580
<v 1>that started it.
And then what happens with comedians?</v>

851
00:52:07.581 --> 00:52:09.290
And then everybody has to top it.

852
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:13.640
So I'm not going to say where it went from there,
but believe me,

853
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:17.120
20 seconds into that conversation,
I could barely stand up.

854
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.860
So we're crying,
laughing as everyone else.
I can't even say in the room.

855
00:52:21.861 --> 00:52:24.620
It was outside in the parking lot.
It's a long fucking story

856
00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:29.410
<v 4>and uh,
but whatever.
And ended up being this awesome fucking Gig.
And uh,</v>

857
00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.100
cause the guy who hosted the show,
he did a real solid,
he went up there,

858
00:52:33.101 --> 00:52:33.880
first of all,

859
00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:38.350
he's the guy who's got to switch it over from people talking about dead puppies

860
00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:42.430
to a,
you know,
hey,
you know what's up with a,
you know,

861
00:52:42.431 --> 00:52:44.470
what's up with these fucking hybrids,
you know,

862
00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.720
and you just feel like this asshole.
He had to do that.
All right.

863
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.640
And not only does he do it,

864
00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:56.890
he drops the f bomb in his first sentence,

865
00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:58.570
which is just,

866
00:52:58.571 --> 00:53:02.620
I can't even tell you what a classy thing that is to do as a comedian because it

867
00:53:02.621 --> 00:53:06.130
just totally,
it just breaks down.
It just,

868
00:53:06.131 --> 00:53:10.720
it just blows the thing wide open.
And He,
and he really has to take the,

869
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:14.860
uh,
just that reaction from people.
I can't,

870
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.940
it's like a kick to the chest.
I can't explain it,
but,
and he totally took it.

871
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:20.790
And I remember standing,
I was standing offstage going,

872
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.650
you don't want a fucking great guy.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

873
00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:26.340
that's like a guy who you look at you like that guy,

874
00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:29.100
he wouldn't rat on you if the cops were looking for you.

875
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:30.720
He wouldn't cock block you.

876
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:33.960
He wouldn't steal your joke just to fucking total stand up,
dude.

877
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.320
Do you know what I mean?
And I already loved the guy,
but as always,

878
00:53:37.321 --> 00:53:41.580
I never named names on this fucking thing.
All right.
So,
uh,
so anyway,

879
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:45.240
so that's what we're doing.
So I ended up going up last and um,

880
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:46.861
they just,

881
00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:50.700
they were a great crowd and I made fun of people who say I rescued a dog and

882
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:52.140
they rolled with everything.

883
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:56.640
I did all my stuff about having a pimple and I just had a great time and I was

884
00:53:56.641 --> 00:53:57.570
like,
isn't this great?

885
00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:02.550
This really makes up for that fucking Twat the week before being such a fucking

886
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:06.810
Twat.
Right?
So I get off stage and people coming out to you,
oh my God,

887
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:09.810
it's so funny.
We were dying laughing,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

888
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.320
Why are you 17 years in your career and you're still playing parking lots?

889
00:54:13.321 --> 00:54:16.230
Who Cares?
You're hilarious.
I'm having a great time.
Right?

890
00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:21.260
And then all of a sudden this fucking chick comes up,
right?
She's got her,

891
00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.850
first of all,
she's got her hair in a ponytail in the front part,

892
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:27.030
look like Cameron Diaz,
his hair,
when she put the ges,

893
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.660
Ben Stiller's Jizz in her hair.
That's what she looked like.

894
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.330
And she comes up to me and I was talking about,
you know,

895
00:54:33.331 --> 00:54:35.400
having a pit bull and how everybody crosses the street.

896
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.550
When I come up the street and she just goes like,
yeah,
you know,

897
00:54:38.551 --> 00:54:40.680
I thought already thought you were funny,
but I have to admit I'm really,

898
00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:41.700
I'm really scared.

899
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.430
I'm really scared of pit bulls and we start having this conversation.

900
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.940
And I was just like,
wow,
you know,
I've had one now,
you know,
four months.

901
00:54:47.941 --> 00:54:50.910
I really think it comes down to the owner,
you know,

902
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.640
and basically the dog's background,
she goes,
yeah,
but you know,

903
00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:57.210
you never really hear about a poodle mauling somebody to death.

904
00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.480
You never hear that on the news.
It's like,
yeah,
because they can't,

905
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.693
okay.

906
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.250
That's the difference between owning a pit bull and owning a poodle,
you know,

907
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.420
is stick to capability of the animal that you have.
Therefore,

908
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.370
if you're a bad owner,

909
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:18.150
your fuck ups get magnified tenfold.

910
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:23.160
And rather than some mailman wrapping some gauze around his ankle,
you know,

911
00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:27.480
they're trying to reattach his fucking juggler.
So,
I mean,
I'm real,

912
00:55:27.481 --> 00:55:31.620
I really believe that.
You know what I mean?
Like,
I mean,
this is,
but granted,

913
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.740
I don't know shit.
Okay.
And I've only owned this thing for fucking four months,

914
00:55:34.741 --> 00:55:39.630
so I have no idea.
But that's what my gut is telling me.
Um,

915
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.390
but people have like this thing now.
I think they just,

916
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.140
they just have this thing and they just snap one day they just snap like they're

917
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:48.720
fucking crazy.
And uh,
I dunno,

918
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.050
maybe I'm blinded by the love I have for this fucking dog,

919
00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:55.140
but I don't believe it.
So we just keep going back and forth and she goes,
I go,

920
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:59.550
no,
it's a pit bull has the ability to mall somebody to death.

921
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.570
Okay.
A poodle is thinking the same shit.
A pit bull is thinking,

922
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.090
I'm going to rip your fucking face off.
It just can't do it.

923
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:10.830
But when it's going at your ankle,
it's trying to maul you to death.
It is.

924
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:15.140
It just can't.
First of all,
it's fucking Afro gets in the way,
you know,
you know,

925
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.360
like when you're fighting your little brother and you just stick your hand on

926
00:56:17.361 --> 00:56:20.550
your,
on his forehead and he's swinging and wind.
That's what happens to a poodle.

927
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.830
You know,
if they come in with the crown of their head,

928
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.930
which if they played in the NFL,
they get fined for it.
All right?

929
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:27.040
Nobody ever talks about that.

930
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:31.000
How fucking dirty those goddamn poodles are always coming in leading with their

931
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:35.790
fucking heads.
Right?
But what happens,
that little poofy thing in,

932
00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:38.230
in and on the top gets in the way.
It's a little cushion.

933
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.680
So you kind of feel that first.
Yeah.
Ooh,
is that a Koozie?
Oh no,

934
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:45.550
that's a poodle trying to mommy to death.
And then you just boot it,
right?

935
00:56:45.551 --> 00:56:50.500
And it's little fucking pathetic excuse for a chest and then it's over.
You know?

936
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:51.251
Isn't that funny?

937
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:53.380
When you kick a little dog off you when they're trying to bite ya,

938
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.660
and then they do that shit where they still want to be tough,

939
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:59.080
but they're sort of walking away is,
is still growing,
you know?

940
00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:00.970
But they don't totally commit to walking away,

941
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:03.250
but they also don't totally commit to attacking you again.

942
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.490
And then you just look at it.
I'm like,
yeah,
that's what I thought.
You know?

943
00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.860
That's what I thought couldn't take it.
Could you?
So anyways,

944
00:57:09.861 --> 00:57:12.910
so we're going back and forth.
So I'm not agreeing with this woman.

945
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.060
She's not making any good points.
And then right in the middle of it,

946
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:18.910
she just goes,
yeah,
well,
I'm,
I'm actually,
I'm an animal expert.

947
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.890
I'm an animal expert.
Like,
you know,
I don't know where she just says that.
I go,

948
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:27.010
you're an animal expert.
She goes,
yeah.
And then she just goes,
whatever.

949
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:31.990
And then she walks away.
This is that a benefit.
Okay.

950
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:35.380
I just donated my time for fucking free.
Okay.

951
00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:39.100
I had to figure out how to do well standing in a parking lot.

952
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:43.420
Okay.
I went through all of that bullshit,
you know,

953
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:45.700
me and all my friends had to go on after people,
you know,

954
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:50.380
talking about dead puppies and then this fucking twat comes up and hits me with

955
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:54.820
that.
And it was,
uh,
here's something for you guys.
Okay.

956
00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.310
Anytime anybody has to break out credits

957
00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.690
to support their argument,
they,
they lost the argument.

958
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:07.130
Okay.
Who the fuck says that?
First of all,
I'm,
I'm an,
I'm actually,

959
00:58:07.131 --> 00:58:11.500
I'm an expert on animals.
Really?
Really?

960
00:58:11.501 --> 00:58:15.490
And you're afraid of dogs.
You know he's a fucking expert on animals.

961
00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:18.580
Is that God damn Cesar Milan,
the dog whisperer.

962
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:22.030
He's not afraid of fucking dogs.
He'll walk into a whole bunch of them.

963
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:27.180
That 42 of them that some old lady adopted and they turned themselves into a

964
00:58:27.221 --> 00:58:30.070
fucking wild pack.
He walks into the middle of them and goes,

965
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.170
and everybody shuts the fuck up.

966
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:36.100
That guy's an expert and I have never heard him once say,
I am an expert.

967
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:41.050
He's never said that shit.
Okay,
I got to tell you this right now.

968
00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:44.830
If I was an expert on animals and I was debating with a moron like me,

969
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:47.020
I would never have to bring out that credit.

970
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:50.650
What I would be doing was just throwing out all my expert knowledge.

971
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.510
First of all,
what I would do,
I was,

972
00:58:52.511 --> 00:58:56.800
I would feign stupidity and let me Wade right into the fucking,
you know,

973
00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.740
you know that shit where you think the water is only two feet deep and all of a

974
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:02.590
sudden it just drops off a hundred feet.
That's what the fuck I would do.

975
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.080
I let you come walking in with all your,
Ooh,

976
00:59:05.081 --> 00:59:07.660
I watch discovery channel for 15 minutes.
Bullshit.

977
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:12.700
And then I'd hit you over the head with such fucking knowledge about pit bulls

978
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:17.020
and dogs that,
that,
that you would come up with the conclusion of God,
damn,

979
00:59:17.021 --> 00:59:18.460
this person's a fucking expert.

980
00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:24.470
But if you're standing there with your fucking just in hair and you don't make

981
00:59:24.471 --> 00:59:26.030
one point and then you just go,

982
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:29.360
I'm an expert and animal expert and then you go whatever,

983
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:32.000
like a fucking seventh grade eight and you walk away.
You know what?

984
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.510
I'm a little biased here,
but I'm going to claim victory on that one.

985
00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:41.190
Whatever.
Look at how I did it.
Who gives a fuck?
You know,

986
00:59:41.191 --> 00:59:43.250
what the fuck is it about me?
I don't understand.

987
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.350
I really don't understand you fucking Twat.

988
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.680
I did the exact fucking thing that you guys are trying to do here.

989
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:52.640
Try to get people to fucking rescue dogs.
Okay.

990
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:57.080
And I did it and I got the biggest psycho of them all.
I went for the pit bull.

991
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:57.690
Okay?

992
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:02.480
Anybody can go down and rescue a fucking Chihuahua and go take them down to Taco

993
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.090
Bell and laugh with your friends as you dress him up in a little fucking midget

994
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:08.510
fur coat,
you know,
and you get the same fucking credit I do.

995
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:14.300
Fucking animal expert.
Go Fuck yourself about that.

996
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.340
Go Fuck yourself and go rinse out your hair.
All right.
So anyways,

997
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.630
let's plow ahead here.
Um,
Oh,
before we get going here,

998
01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:29.840
this is something I guess I remember last week when I basically grovelled for

999
01:00:29.841 --> 01:00:33.290
you people to come to Ontario,
the Improv in Ontario.

1000
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.300
I jinxed it.
Okay.
I literally did that,
that you know,

1001
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.590
begging you guys to come out.

1002
01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:44.120
Like I was doing a fucking telethon and then what happens?
Like two days later,

1003
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:47.270
my guy calls me,
oh,
we got to move the date distinct came in,

1004
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:51.650
you got to do this day.
But bubba,
so now the Ontario Improv Gig is off.

1005
01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.900
It's not totally off.
It is being rescheduled.
Um,

1006
01:00:56.901 --> 01:01:00.350
I'm actually doing a college gig.
It's a long,

1007
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.120
long fucking story,

1008
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.500
but I apologize because I got probably a half a dozen dozen emails,

1009
01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:09.950
which is a lot for me of people telling me.
I went out and I bought tickets.

1010
01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:12.470
So psyched to see us a site.
You're going to be in California.

1011
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:15.770
I'm here to support your bill,
you know,
Yo,

1012
01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:19.520
your rang the bell and I answered the call.
Okay.

1013
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:22.760
And what do I get for it?
I get a fucking slap in the face.

1014
01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:25.850
I apologize to all you guys went out and bought tickets.
I feel like an asshole.

1015
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:27.620
And,
um,

1016
01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.700
I don't know what to tell you because I'm going to be ringing the bell again

1017
01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:36.410
when that fucking thing comes around because I don't know.
Southern California,

1018
01:01:36.411 --> 01:01:38.390
this is like the fucking matrix out here.

1019
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.790
I don't even if that's the right analogy,
I don't know what it is.
It's kind of,

1020
01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:41.624
you know,

1021
01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:45.230
I've got to get on one of those Latino stations out here that'll get a white guy

1022
01:01:45.231 --> 01:01:48.560
on there,
learned some Spanish or some shit.

1023
01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:52.940
I gotta do something because it ain't happening for me out here.
Um,
anyways,

1024
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:57.620
let's plow ahead here.
Uh,
all right,
here's a story that somebody sent me.

1025
01:01:57.621 --> 01:02:01.610
Here's the story that somebody sent me that I found interesting.

1026
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:06.470
I really thought it interesting.
Um,
there's,
you know,

1027
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.850
you got these bloggers here on the,
uh,
you know,
bloggers.
Sure.

1028
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:12.800
We all do.
Hell,

1029
01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.670
I even blog for a while till I found out that my space owned them and can do

1030
01:02:16.671 --> 01:02:21.470
whatever the fuck they wanted to with them.
Um,
but anyways,
you know,

1031
01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:23.550
these bloggers,
they,
they make fun of what celebrities,

1032
01:02:23.551 --> 01:02:26.670
where they say a bunch of stuff.
They draw cum on their face.

1033
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:30.180
They do all that hilarious shit or whatever.

1034
01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:35.210
So evidently one of them at something called I think skanks of New York and I

1035
01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.700
fucking know what it was.
But uh,

1036
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:42.990
they basically trashed this supermodel.

1037
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:47.460
I can't call her a supermodel cause I'd never heard of her.
Her name is Liz Kula.

1038
01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:51.390
Cohen Cohen,
less cool,
less Schoola

1039
01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:54.840
to Lib quietly.

1040
01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:59.540
It's like me trying to say that rapper's name and I already forgot how to say it

1041
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.860
quietly.
I don't give a fuck what I'm telling you that right now.

1042
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:05.260
You guys send me all that hip hop shit and uh,
I'm really liking that,

1043
01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:09.600
that most deaf Alma from 1999 was that the one black on both sides?

1044
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:13.170
I don't know.
I've actually listened to two of the tracks on it.

1045
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.130
And at first it was beyond me.
Yeah,
it was,

1046
01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:20.130
it was beyond what my year's could fucking handle.

1047
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:24.000
And now I have slowly caught up and now I'm really starting to love it and I

1048
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.290
only downloaded two of the songs.

1049
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:29.280
Now I'm going to go back and download the rest of the fucking album,
uh,
legally,

1050
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:34.470
by the way.
So anyways,
uh,
this list Cooler Cohen who,
uh,

1051
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.080
does not look like a supermodel,
I gotta be honest with you.
She looks like,
um,

1052
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:45.540
some hot mom who settled for less and is now sitting there going,
you know what?

1053
01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:46.680
I could've been a model,

1054
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:51.240
but instead I married the Douche bag and accounting and I have two kids and I'm

1055
01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:53.460
in a culdesac and it's not exciting.

1056
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:58.590
We have macaroni and cheese with toast every Wednesday.

1057
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.150
I just don't like my life
and you know,
you know where it goes from there.

1058
01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.350
Then she ends up,
you know,

1059
01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.240
she ends up blowing that guy who hangs out in the fucking local borrower has the

1060
01:04:09.241 --> 01:04:12.300
cool car,
goes right back to high school.
You know what I mean?

1061
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:16.260
She just looks for the biggest swinging dick she can find within our area.

1062
01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.680
You know?
And then that that's what she looks like to me.

1063
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.260
I wonder if she's going to fuck.
Well I,
she can't fucking out me.

1064
01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.540
She knows who the fuck I am.
The Monday morning podcast.
Cunty all right.

1065
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.060
Uh,
so this is what happens is a vogue cover girl has one,

1066
01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:34.710
a precedent setting court battle to unmask an anonymous blogger who called her a

1067
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:39.660
skank on the Internet.
I mean,
they basically paraphrase what,
uh,

1068
01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:41.460
what the person said.
They basically would have to say,

1069
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:45.720
I would have to say the first place award for this Skanky hissed in New York

1070
01:04:45.721 --> 01:04:49.470
City would have to go to lists.
Schoola Genteel Cohen,

1071
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:55.050
the blogger anonymous wrote in one posting the blog since remove,

1072
01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:55.771
since removed,

1073
01:04:55.771 --> 01:05:00.771
ridiculed the former Australian vogue cover girl as a 40 something who may have

1074
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:05.580
been hot 10 years ago when she was actually a 36.

1075
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:07.650
So evidently,

1076
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:10.740
I guess they'd been going off on her for awhile and she got tired of it.

1077
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:14.930
So she went to Google and she sued to have the A,

1078
01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.440
she wanted to know who this person was,
who was trashing her.

1079
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.190
So somebody sent me an email and was like,
can you believe this?

1080
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:24.700
Fucking so and so.
Doesn't this come with being famous?

1081
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:28.100
Why don't you go cry with all your money and blah,
blah.

1082
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.250
The usual shit that they say about celebrity.

1083
01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:34.570
And I have to be honest with you guys,
I,
I can see both sides of this story.

1084
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:36.700
Okay.
First and foremost,

1085
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:42.150
the fact that she was able to get Google to cave in and to,

1086
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:47.110
uh,
give her the name of the blogger is kind of a dangerous thing.

1087
01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:49.660
Where when cases like this happen,
you know,

1088
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:53.980
it's this little fucking whatever case,
a bunch of people,
you know,

1089
01:05:53.981 --> 01:05:55.030
you open that door,

1090
01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:00.180
fucking run through the door and a piggy back on that case.

1091
01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:05.080
And then all of a sudden there'll be laws where you can censor what people write

1092
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:09.760
and you can sue people.
Um,
so,

1093
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:14.290
cause I mean the Internet right now is like the fucking wild west back in the

1094
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:17.170
day.
Do you ever think about that shit?
There was no banks,

1095
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.180
there was no fucking credit cards.
You know,
there was no mortgage.

1096
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.440
You just chopped down some trees with your friends and your built a square with

1097
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:31.330
a roof on it.
You know,
shooting Indians,
there was,
you know,

1098
01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:35.920
hang 'em,
high fucking frontier,
Justice,
rape,

1099
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:37.270
pillage,
all that type of shit.

1100
01:06:37.271 --> 01:06:40.930
That's what the Internet is basically like right now.

1101
01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:42.370
And they're essentially,

1102
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:46.000
I think with stuff like this will eventually whittle it down.

1103
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.080
Um,
and you know,
it's Kinda hard to,
you know,

1104
01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:53.680
some of the stuff and obviously it's horrible pornography on it,
you know,

1105
01:06:53.681 --> 01:06:56.590
I'm not really into that shit.
I wish I could stop fucking watching it.

1106
01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.050
I wish someone would actually helped me to stop watching it by censoring it.

1107
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.980
What a fucking pathetic loser I am.
But anyways,
um,

1108
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.540
but then you can go too far with the shit because I was seeing you guys and let

1109
01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:12.750
famous picture that iconic photo that,
that,

1110
01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:16.200
that guy who stood in front of the tank and Tiananmen Square,
uh,

1111
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:18.400
back in 1990 or 89 or nine,

1112
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.400
I think it was 89 if you can believe it was 20 fucking years ago that happened.

1113
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:25.060
Most Chinese young people in their twenties,

1114
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:28.120
if you show them that photo,
they don't even know what it is,

1115
01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:32.530
what it refers to cause they basically over there with their fucking police

1116
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:37.531
state is they just erase the whole existence like in a style and ask kind of

1117
01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:43.960
way.
We're back in the day,
I don't know.
It's George.
Um,
George Yosef.

1118
01:07:43.961 --> 01:07:47.710
Stalin would,
uh,
you know,

1119
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:50.140
he's a paranoid psycho and when he would offer you,

1120
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.760
not only would he have you killed,

1121
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:56.620
he would have some dude like a ratio out of all photos,
like heat your,

1122
01:07:56.621 --> 01:07:59.380
your existence.
You didn't even exist.

1123
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.190
There was no like documentation of it.
And that's,
you know,

1124
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:07.540
that's the other end of this little cases like this that,
uh,

1125
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:12.550
that make them scary.
But having said that on the other side,
just as a performer,

1126
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:16.970
um,
I actually,
that,
that piece of Shit,

1127
01:08:16.971 --> 01:08:20.450
little fucking rat got dragged out into the sunlight.
Okay.

1128
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.440
Because even at the pathetic level that I'm on,

1129
01:08:23.441 --> 01:08:26.300
and you can't believe how bad you get fucking trash to the point.

1130
01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:30.560
I never read any reviews.
I don't read,
I don't read anything.

1131
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:35.060
I never watched any clips of mine on the Internet.
I never do any of that shit,

1132
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.610
uh,
because people just,

1133
01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:40.400
they just write the most horrific shit that they can about you.

1134
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.420
And it would be hypocritical of me because I'm a comedian and look at me,

1135
01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:48.140
I trashed people all the time,
so I can't get mad at it,
but I got to admit,
dude,

1136
01:08:48.141 --> 01:08:52.760
I don't want to read it.
Um,
so,

1137
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:57.680
but this,
she's just a fucking model.
You know what I mean?
And,

1138
01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:01.190
um,
I dunno,
there's just like a point where you,
you know,

1139
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:03.650
you're in the public eye and someone can trash you,
but you know,

1140
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:06.920
they start writing shit that if you actually had it in a newspaper,

1141
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:11.690
you'd get sued for slander.
You know what I mean?

1142
01:09:11.691 --> 01:09:15.950
To suggest that she's 40 years old when she's only 36 might not seem like a big

1143
01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.650
deal to me or anybody else.
But that's a huge fucking thing.

1144
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:21.800
And the modeling industry,
and not only that,

1145
01:09:21.801 --> 01:09:23.210
I gotta tell you these fucking industry people,

1146
01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:25.820
they don't know shit about the Internet.
They don't know how to control it.

1147
01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:28.330
They're trying to figure it out.
And all it takes is one,
right

1148
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.510
<v 1>Douche bag with enough fucking people behind them.
And they're like,
oh,</v>

1149
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:34.010
this is what everybody's thinking.

1150
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.400
So does fucking Twat is writing this stuff about her and she's actually

1151
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:45.950
potentially fucking with her ability to get gigs.

1152
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:50.540
So,
I'm not saying that the person shouldn't be able to do that,

1153
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:54.020
but if you're going to do something that at somebody,
at least,
you know,

1154
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.510
have the balls to put your name out there.
You know?

1155
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:00.201
And that's what I like,

1156
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:02.750
because now this person's going to get dragged out there and hopefully people

1157
01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:06.080
will know who the fuck she is and she'll get to see what it feels like because

1158
01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:08.930
then people are going to be going off on her.
You know?

1159
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:11.510
Cause actually it turned out that it was,
it was one of this,
this uh,

1160
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:15.110
this model's friends,
which I think is fucking hilarious.

1161
01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.730
You know how awful and awkward,
you know,
does she feel right now?

1162
01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:24.140
You know what the worst thing is,
is I bet she cried.
I'm so sorry.

1163
01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:28.550
I just that going through some things and you're just so beautiful and I don't

1164
01:10:28.551 --> 01:10:31.780
know.
I am so embarrassed now.

1165
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:34.820
They just fucking cry their way out of that shit.
Well,

1166
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:36.110
I think that works with guys.

1167
01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:40.490
It doesn't work with women because they cause this fucking supermodel chick.

1168
01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:44.370
She probably does that shit too.
Oh,
sorry.
I do coke.

1169
01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:46.190
It keeps the Sketti.
I didn't want to,

1170
01:10:46.191 --> 01:10:49.760
I look cut belly fill the fucking the Katy shot,
you know,

1171
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.270
so that shit doesn't work on her.
You know what I mean?

1172
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.430
That'd be like trying to use the force against Yoda.

1173
01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:56.860
He knows what the fuck you doing.

1174
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.320
So I think it's great.

1175
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:05.700
I hope she just fucking stairs at and when this blubbering fucking coward,

1176
01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:07.163
you know

1177
01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.800
<v 4>cow or did I really just use that fucking word?
Whatever.
The fucking little,</v>

1178
01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:15.810
you know what this,
the difference between what I do,
because look at me.

1179
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:19.110
I'm going off on this girl right now,
but you know,
I don't fucking know her.

1180
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:23.550
All right.
This,
I'm going to justify my boat.
I am so full of Shit,
right.

1181
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.950
This is how I'm going to justify me.
I don't know her.

1182
01:11:25.951 --> 01:11:30.300
And also my name is on this podcast,
so no need to sue me.

1183
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:33.450
You know who the fuck I am and then I got shit on the Internet that she could

1184
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:38.230
then go comment on,
you know?
Right.
All right.

1185
01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.680
Better than that fucking piece of shit.
I don't think I am.

1186
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:45.900
I think get Jesus Christ.
I think I'm the same person.
Um,
all right.

1187
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.630
So if that made any sense.
I think it's scary that,
that,

1188
01:11:48.631 --> 01:11:53.040
that this case could actually start a opening a door for some major censorship

1189
01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:56.700
in the future.
And,
but then on the other side,
I love that,
uh,

1190
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:59.430
somebody who was talking shit got caught for it.

1191
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.460
I really liked that and I just wish I could have had a video of that girl trying

1192
01:12:04.651 --> 01:12:08.520
to fight the injunction or whatever the hell the legal term is,

1193
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.380
realizing that Google was going to give up her name and just her freaking the

1194
01:12:13.381 --> 01:12:16.500
fuck out,
realizing,
you know,

1195
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.920
trying to get off that track when you know it's headed right towards a brick

1196
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:21.000
wall and she can't.

1197
01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:26.330
And then that fucking moment when she realizes that our friend knows that she's

1198
01:12:26.521 --> 01:12:29.760
the fucking Twat who's been writing all that shit about her.

1199
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:34.560
And then she sits there going,
what do I do?
What do I do?
Do I call her?

1200
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:40.170
What do I say?
And as she's trying to work all of that bullshit out,

1201
01:12:40.171 --> 01:12:44.310
her home phone rings and who's on the caller id?

1202
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:47.880
But this chick who she called a fucking Skank,
you know what?

1203
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:50.670
I bet our friend of this does fucking list.

1204
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:54.870
Kula Cohen was actually talking to the girl looking for some comfort.

1205
01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:58.350
They're writing all these horrible things about me.

1206
01:12:58.351 --> 01:13:02.730
Why do people write the thing?
And that fucking Twat kept a straight face going.

1207
01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:03.750
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1208
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.670
And then like silently getting like some joy out of the fact that she's

1209
01:13:08.671 --> 01:13:13.050
torturing her and she probably,
you know,
as she comforted her,

1210
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:16.080
tried to figure out what part of it hurt her most.

1211
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:20.280
I know it's just terrible that she called you as gangs.

1212
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:25.260
I think that's way worse than questioning if you're 40 years old,

1213
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.650
don't you?
Or do you think the age thing hurts more?
They're,
they're there,

1214
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.610
you know,
and basically figuring out how to attack her even more.

1215
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.410
I love that she got caught.
I love it.
That's fucking great.

1216
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.650
All right,
let's move on.
I this,
this is basically,

1217
01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:44.430
and I went on a couple of these,
these bloggers sites,
um,
and I got to met.
Dude,
I,

1218
01:13:44.431 --> 01:13:48.840
I've gone on these,
these,
um,
some of these blogger things,
uh,

1219
01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.730
actually has bullshit.
I have in my,
uh,
my girlfriend looks at some of them.

1220
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.520
She's into that guy,
uh,
uh,
Perez Hilton,

1221
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.490
and he's a dude who draws the ges on people's face.
And I got it.

1222
01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.500
That's just fucking funny.
Alright.
It's childish.
It's,

1223
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.360
it's,
it's not mature.
It's everything that makes something fucking hilarious.

1224
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:14.830
And,
uh,
and you know who the guy is,
you know his name,

1225
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:17.230
you know he's out there.
There's pictures of him on the Internet,

1226
01:14:17.231 --> 01:14:20.260
so people trash and back.
I think it's a little tit for tat there,

1227
01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:23.440
but if you're going to write all that bullshit and go under anonymous,
I dunno.
I,

1228
01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.860
I think there's a all right,

1229
01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:28.150
but why don't you say the same thing 58 fucking times?
We got it.
All right.

1230
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:29.140
So anyways,
so I went on one of these,

1231
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:32.140
these blogger things and this is the type of shit that people,
right.

1232
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:37.060
Um,
they were going off on Ringo Starr.
There was basically,

1233
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:40.600
why is Ringo Starr such a jerk?
And I just,

1234
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.040
I already love where this is the jumping off point of this,
you know,

1235
01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.410
none of these people I've ever met him.

1236
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.500
I thought somebody would have met him in an airport and they asked him,

1237
01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:51.730
they said,
hey,
uh,
hey Ringo,
uh,
can you sign,
uh,

1238
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.630
can you sign my fucking tee shirt and can you also answer me why you've been

1239
01:14:55.631 --> 01:14:58.120
wearing the same earring for the last 40 years?

1240
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:03.810
That long one that's hanging down like Kurt Russel in big trouble in little

1241
01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:08.710
China.
Okay.
That look was out in the 80s,

1242
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:11.110
that fucking long dangling earring.

1243
01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.590
You look the bad guy in some fucking a Mel Gibson movie,

1244
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.480
or at least you have the jewelry of the bad guy.
All right?
Uh,
Sony was,

1245
01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:19.930
it says a Beatles member.

1246
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.580
Ringo Starr posted a video to today to his fans telling him that he will no

1247
01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:29.581
longer be accepting any fan mail after October 20th because he has too much to

1248
01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:33.160
do.
Uh,
and then it says what?

1249
01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:35.080
Like counting your piles of money,

1250
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:40.590
sliding down a solid gold waterslide making origami hunting.

1251
01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:42.790
What the fuck that is?
Or if I even said that,
right,

1252
01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:46.580
origami out of hundred dollar bills.
And then it says,
Huh,

1253
01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.370
here's the video fucking Moron people,
right?

1254
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:56.170
Like,
because he's rich and famous,
like he's got nothing better to do.

1255
01:15:56.171 --> 01:15:58.480
And just to Kinda,
I mean,
the guy's like 70 years old,

1256
01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:02.740
maybe his fucking wrist hurts from writing back to people.

1257
01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.290
Okay.
Maybe,
you know,

1258
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:09.790
he's sick and he knows he's going to die and he wants to go fucking drive a

1259
01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:11.220
Harley Davidson across the county.

1260
01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:14.950
You have no fucking idea what's going on in this guy's life.
So somebody writes,

1261
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.230
I've lost all respect for this man.

1262
01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.530
How rude and disrespectful to all his fans.

1263
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:24.880
He should be kissing the fans ass since,
uh,
acids.

1264
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:29.650
Since us fans are the ones who made him who he is today.
I,

1265
01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:34.651
there's nothing I fucking hate more than when fans take credit for the fucking

1266
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.870
unbelievable talent of a fucking,

1267
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:40.180
of ring of a star like that.

1268
01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:45.070
Really the fans made the Beatles the greatest fucking band ever.

1269
01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.230
You know,
like,

1270
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:51.760
like any of the fans could fucking ignore what a juggernaut that band,
well,

1271
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:55.330
oh yeah,
sergeant pepper's.
Yeah.
Fuck that.
That had nothing to do with anything.

1272
01:16:55.331 --> 01:16:59.230
If it wasn't for those fans screaming at their shows,

1273
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:03.760
you know that's,
you don't make them who they are.

1274
01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.080
They make who they are.

1275
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:09.230
It's not like they're sitting there and then you guys all walk up to them go,

1276
01:17:09.231 --> 01:17:11.810
hey,
you want to be famous?
Get up on stage,

1277
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.960
play whatever you want and we're going to scream and go nuts.
No,

1278
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:18.710
they have to fucking go into bars and they have to get booed and they have to

1279
01:17:18.711 --> 01:17:19.850
have shit thrown at them.

1280
01:17:19.851 --> 01:17:22.640
That whole blues brothers scene with a beer bottles get thrown at you or

1281
01:17:22.641 --> 01:17:26.720
whatever.
You got to go through fucking 20 years of that shit.
Actually,

1282
01:17:26.721 --> 01:17:28.940
those cuts they made when they were like 25 whatever,

1283
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:32.030
10 15 fucking years of that crap.
All right.

1284
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.460
Do you have to have the balls to walk away from the safe life of,

1285
01:17:37.461 --> 01:17:40.580
of going to college and getting a fucking job and no one,

1286
01:17:40.581 --> 01:17:44.000
you're going to have a paycheck.
You have to step off into the fucking abyss.

1287
01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:49.160
Knowing that 99.9% of you never even make enough to get out of that stinky,

1288
01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:53.290
sweaty fucking van that you're driving around in you gotta,

1289
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:54.620
you gotta you basically,

1290
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:59.750
you take your life savings and you bet on the fucking 90 to one dog,
you know,

1291
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.250
that's what the fuck you do.
All right?
And then you have to come with,

1292
01:18:03.251 --> 01:18:06.890
you have to create something that's so fucking great that that amount of people

1293
01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.440
will pay attention to it.
All right?

1294
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.340
You fucking arrogant assholes.
This guy is probably,
they see,

1295
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:18.020
this guy's probably been answering fan mail and signing autographs for half a

1296
01:18:18.021 --> 01:18:21.170
fucking century.
He wants to put the pen down.

1297
01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.280
Can he do that in his seventies?
You fucking twats.

1298
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.790
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1299
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:30.270
<v 4>Jesus Christ.
And having said all that,</v>

1300
01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:34.160
I will be signing my DVDs and kissing babies after all of my shows.

1301
01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:42.000
Ah,
you know what?
I would love to get to that level where I could just be like,

1302
01:18:42.001 --> 01:18:46.350
yeah,
listen,
yeah,
I'm not interacting with you motherfuckers anymore.
You know,

1303
01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.760
and I'm so fucking,
it's almost like he can live off the interest.
You know,

1304
01:18:50.761 --> 01:18:52.950
when you have so much money,
you could live off the interest of your money.

1305
01:18:52.951 --> 01:18:57.090
He can live off the interest of the fan base that he has.

1306
01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.830
And no matter how much it drops off because he's not going to sell,
you know,

1307
01:19:01.831 --> 01:19:06.480
sign eight by tens from that fucking Bangladesh concert he did with George

1308
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.200
Harrison.
You know?
That's another reason why I wouldn't want to be him.

1309
01:19:10.201 --> 01:19:12.900
Sign a fucking autographs.
You know what I mean?

1310
01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:17.100
It's really depressing to look at a headshot of myself 10 years ago.

1311
01:19:17.101 --> 01:19:21.870
Forget about one 40 fucking years ago.
You know what I mean?
You know,

1312
01:19:21.871 --> 01:19:26.090
no one ever comes up with a headshot of Ringo fucking 70 years old putting Ben

1313
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:29.130
gay on his fucking Bass Drum foot.
You know,

1314
01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.170
they always got on when he's young and in his prime.

1315
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.650
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1316
01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:35.600
<v 4>he probably sits day like,
what's the matter mate?
You don't like me now?</v>

1317
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1318
01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:40.120
<v 4>How about when I'm all wrinkled up or a terrible fucking does that Ringo?</v>

1319
01:19:40.121 --> 01:19:43.360
Who the fuck was that?
I don't know who that was.
All I know is that was horrible.

1320
01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.870
And if you had a fucking shred of self esteem,

1321
01:19:46.871 --> 01:19:49.510
you'd fucking stop this podcast right now.
All right,

1322
01:19:49.511 --> 01:19:53.710
let's get on to some are videos here.
Um,
this is in a funny youtube video.

1323
01:19:53.711 --> 01:19:57.220
This is a fucking amazing video.
Okay.
And I guys,

1324
01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:02.020
I want you guys right now to take out a pen if you're in your cubicle slide over

1325
01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:06.460
your little yellow sticky things because this is a long link and this is a guy

1326
01:20:06.461 --> 01:20:11.461
who basically explains the banking crisis and how we're moving into like the

1327
01:20:12.361 --> 01:20:16.470
little robot age where uh,
you know,

1328
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.510
some of the stuff that they're coming up with like their,

1329
01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:20.880
they can like grow an ear in a petri dish.

1330
01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:25.881
Now they're talking about some lady who had like an eye cancer of her esophagus

1331
01:20:26.581 --> 01:20:30.450
and they scraped off from some cells from her esophagus,

1332
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:34.020
put it in a dish and they grew her a new fucking esophagus.

1333
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:40.570
And then it goes all into like if you're into the bionic man and hybrid cars in

1334
01:20:41.061 --> 01:20:45.830
Cyborgs,
it's,
they got a fucking clip on this thing.
This is the trailer for it,

1335
01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.520
where this showing this robot that basically looks like a turtle with midget

1336
01:20:51.741 --> 01:20:52.820
giraffe legs,

1337
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:58.240
a turtle on stilts,

1338
01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:02.230
like deer legs and it is running sort of trotting along.

1339
01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:07.060
And this scientists walks up and just fucking gives it a front kick as hard as

1340
01:21:07.061 --> 01:21:08.890
you possibly could to the side,

1341
01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.200
which would have tipped over any other robot.
And this thing just sort does,

1342
01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:16.600
just goes with it like a living,
breathing thing.
Like whoa.

1343
01:21:16.601 --> 01:21:20.020
Kind of like goes to the side.
Like you know,
like when a running back is,

1344
01:21:20.021 --> 01:21:23.770
is doing the sweep and that guy dies and he hits him in his hip and it just

1345
01:21:23.771 --> 01:21:25.210
knocked some five feet sideways.

1346
01:21:25.211 --> 01:21:27.790
But he's able to regain his balance and continue moving forward.

1347
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:29.920
That's what the fuck this robot thing does.

1348
01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:35.110
So this dude starts with the banks and he ends with these robots and he starts

1349
01:21:35.111 --> 01:21:39.430
talking about how all the different versions of man have overlapped each other

1350
01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:43.660
like uh,
uh,
like neanderthals,

1351
01:21:43.661 --> 01:21:45.770
Homo sapiens and that type of whatever they,
they,

1352
01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:50.780
they at one point we both exist existed on the earth at the same time before

1353
01:21:51.851 --> 01:21:52.900
homo sapiens took over.

1354
01:21:52.901 --> 01:21:57.070
I know I'm using the wrong fucking CROMAC domes Nariana falls or whatever they

1355
01:21:57.071 --> 01:21:58.390
overlapped and that type of shit.

1356
01:21:58.390 --> 01:22:03.390
So with this guy is trying to suggest is that the half robot and person is going

1357
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:09.700
to overlap the 100% human thing?
It is.
It's the fucking shit.

1358
01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.320
And it's not boring either guys.
Actually he keeps it funny.
So here is the link.

1359
01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.260
Okay.
Would that really long trailer,
I wanted to do that.

1360
01:22:17.261 --> 01:22:19.630
So you guys have time to jot this down cause you really should watch it.

1361
01:22:19.631 --> 01:22:20.620
It's fucking fascinating.

1362
01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:26.040
It's www.tedlikethenametedted.com/talks/one_and Rica has e n r I Q,

1363
01:22:37.121 --> 01:22:41.830
u e z underscore shares,
s h a.

1364
01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:46.240
R.
E s underscores underscore mind boggling.

1365
01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:50.770
Underscore,
knew half of you don't even give a fuck at this point.
I know,

1366
01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.570
but some of you do underscore science.
Dot.
H t m l.

1367
01:22:56.410 --> 01:23:01.330
All right.
And if he got lost in all that,
just go to ted.com and just,
you know,

1368
01:23:01.331 --> 01:23:03.910
go around the web.
So that's what I gave you was a direct link,

1369
01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:06.880
but you can go around the website.
I'm sure he can find it because it's a,

1370
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.230
you know,
as dumb as I sounded the other day.

1371
01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:16.570
Jesus Christ.
Nia.
Um,
sorry.

1372
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:21.310
What,
what you're looking good.
You're looking really good.

1373
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:29.380
All right,
well I didn't know you were in the room.
Okay.
Anyways,
uh,

1374
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:36.610
so anyways,
um,
what you mean what's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

1375
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.650
I'm doing a podcast here.

1376
01:23:38.651 --> 01:23:42.550
I you just see the red light on outside the fucking bedroom door that said on

1377
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:46.180
air.
I love what you just laugh at me when I do these.
See,

1378
01:23:46.181 --> 01:23:48.280
she has the advantage of seeing how crazy I look.

1379
01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:52.150
I'm basically sitting here on my boxers,
my t shirt,
and my little headphones,

1380
01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:53.950
like I'm doing some sort of pirate radio.

1381
01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:59.490
And she literally walks in as unlike a ted underscore slash backspace.

1382
01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:04.630
What's going on with the world?
underscore.com?
Hotmail.

1383
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:07.810
You're really dating a fucking loser.
How does that feel?

1384
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:15.870
<v 11>They wouldn't let him do this number.
Maybe it's certain things.
They fight that.</v>

1385
01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:17.230
Yeah.

1386
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:22.870
<v 4>Hi,
this is,
this thing is for me to trash people not to get trashed.</v>

1387
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:27.400
Why don't you fucking get Outta here?
Get outta here.
All right.
Thank you.

1388
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:31.070
I want a sweetheart now.
Beat it.
All right.

1389
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:37.450
All right,
let's,
let's fucking get this.
Uh,
let's get this back together here.

1390
01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:42.610
All right.
She's stumbling out of the room laughing at me.
See,
you hear that.

1391
01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:47.440
You're laughing.
All right.
Uh,
here's a,
here's a really good email that I got.
Um,

1392
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:51.370
somebody said,
Bill,
if you're looking for a sport,
a new sport,

1393
01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.450
I'm gradually getting back into baseball by the way.
Uh,

1394
01:24:54.451 --> 01:24:56.550
I got to support my red sox because,
uh,

1395
01:24:57.050 --> 01:25:01.780
there are they going through the dog days right now.
All right.
And,

1396
01:25:01.781 --> 01:25:06.160
uh,
you know,
be one thing at the red sox were doing good and I was just like,

1397
01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:09.490
all right,
I,
I need to take a break from baseball,
you know,

1398
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:12.460
then I could actually do it.
But the fact that they're not doing well right now,

1399
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.510
now,
now you know,
this is when the real fans show who the fuck they are.
So I'm,

1400
01:25:17.511 --> 01:25:18.344
I'm coming back,

1401
01:25:18.850 --> 01:25:22.140
I'm gradually coming back with this guy was giving me a suggestion on a sports

1402
01:25:22.141 --> 01:25:24.520
that I should watch.
It said,
Bill,
if you're looking for a sport,

1403
01:25:24.521 --> 01:25:26.710
you really need to delve into MMA,

1404
01:25:26.711 --> 01:25:29.920
UFC and make an effort to become a serious fan.

1405
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:34.390
I really got into it for a while and,
uh,
um,
I still really like it.
I just,

1406
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.350
I get busy and on the road and I try to,
um,

1407
01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.680
I mean my favorite reality show is the ultimate fighter.
You know what I mean?

1408
01:25:41.681 --> 01:25:44.860
Every other fucking show you make a bad sloppy Joe,

1409
01:25:44.861 --> 01:25:47.920
when you get kicked off the show and this one,
you get your fucking ass.

1410
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:51.700
You literally get beaten off the shelf.
So I really enjoy that.
But anyways,
um,

1411
01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:56.230
said,
I know you're a casual fan,
but the sport really is exciting,

1412
01:25:56.231 --> 01:25:57.070
highly technical,

1413
01:25:57.071 --> 01:26:01.390
and it satisfies a primal urge with mem to compete and beat on one another.

1414
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:06.680
But it's in a somewhat state,
uh,
safe and sanctioned environment.

1415
01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.880
I know that 50 to 75% of the fans are meatheads and strippers.

1416
01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.030
And while that's annoying,

1417
01:26:14.031 --> 01:26:19.030
you just have to block that out and focus on the sport itself.
It,
it,

1418
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:23.450
uh,
it really is the future because it's so natural and basic and doesn't require

1419
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:27.550
any super fluid.
I don't want to say it.
So how do you say that?
Nea.
Sup.

1420
01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.060
So peripheral lists.

1421
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:34.150
There's no fucking I in that he wrote super and then f you.

1422
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:39.140
F L U.
O.
U.
S.
Super.
Huh.
Oh,
good.

1423
01:26:39.141 --> 01:26:41.060
You're dumb too.
Let's have a dumb kid

1424
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:47.630
and then we'll be those parents who show up when they're going.
Yeah.

1425
01:26:47.631 --> 01:26:51.680
Basically your kids are more on,
no,
is it my kid's smart.

1426
01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.280
All right.
Anyways,

1427
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:59.900
it says that it really is the future because it's so natural and basically and

1428
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:02.300
basic.
It doesn't require any,
oh my God,

1429
01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:05.360
I thought I went past the sentence where this word is and I'm back to it again.

1430
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:08.450
And he's super superfluous.
Rules and equipment.

1431
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:11.450
It's just man verse man with nothing but physical fighting skills,

1432
01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:16.460
strategic acumen.
I is this guy trying to fuck me up and courage.
Beautiful.

1433
01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:18.680
All right guys,
you find a new thing that you can do to me.

1434
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:24.140
Send emails with big words that I can't pronounce,
pronounce.

1435
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:27.080
I'm just as just fucking unraveling.
All right,

1436
01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:29.170
let's get to the fucking youtube videos.
Um,

1437
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:34.070
this is a great quick youtube video that will give you a laugh.
Uh,

1438
01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:37.280
it's called a girl gets answer very wrong.

1439
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.640
Please watch this girl gets answered very wrong.

1440
01:27:40.641 --> 01:27:44.090
That's what you search on Youtube.
Um,
this next one,

1441
01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.410
somebody sent me this and I actually,

1442
01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:48.830
I can't believe I forgot about this one cause I stumbled upon this one before.

1443
01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:51.640
These ones are fucking hilarious.
Um,

1444
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:56.770
there's one called Eddie van Halen shreds and there's another one Santana

1445
01:27:56.871 --> 01:28:01.190
shreds.
And basically what it is is,
you know,
there's a bunch of,
you know,

1446
01:28:01.191 --> 01:28:02.570
musicians go on,
you know,

1447
01:28:02.571 --> 01:28:06.920
up and coming guitarists and they watch all these great guitar gods and they

1448
01:28:06.921 --> 01:28:10.460
watched the eclipse and then they rate them.
You know,
that sucks.

1449
01:28:10.461 --> 01:28:12.830
I give dead five or 10 stars or whatever.

1450
01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.530
But there's certain guys I get a van Halen.
He's just the shit.

1451
01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.820
You just can't fuck with them.
So what this guy does,
he actually plays,

1452
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.490
he plays guitar,
he gets rid of the audio,

1453
01:28:22.491 --> 01:28:25.310
he keeps the clip of Eddie van Halen and concert.

1454
01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.540
And then he plays the worst fucking guitar ever underneath it.

1455
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:34.870
But he does it perfectly where if Eddie's fingers are moving up the neck,

1456
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:39.320
the guy moves up the neck playing horrifically.

1457
01:28:39.321 --> 01:28:43.070
So it really sounds like Eddie is playing the guitar horribly,

1458
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:48.050
but he puts it under Eddie van Halen shred.
So all these guys,
you know,

1459
01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.100
they want to see any shred and then they just get this horrific video that not

1460
01:28:52.101 --> 01:28:54.770
only is not Eddie shredding,
but it makes them look like an asshole.

1461
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:58.400
And then people get all mad,
dude,
you should just kill yourself.

1462
01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:02.100
We'd fucking loser that.
He's a god.
Why would you do that?
You know,

1463
01:29:02.101 --> 01:29:05.280
it's usual shit.
You annoy somebody.
That's funny.
Um,
here's another one.

1464
01:29:05.281 --> 01:29:06.114
Another one,

1465
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:11.010
funny used car ad ad is spelled a d not a d.
D.

1466
01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.960
Um,
now this is another good one.
Harrison Ford,
my wife,

1467
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:18.120
my family compilation.

1468

1469
01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.620
<v 4>Then here's another one.
This is an Arnold Schwarzenegger one.
That's great.</v>

1470
01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:28.030
It's called Arnold.
Arnold is funny.
Um,

1471
01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:31.120
and here's the last one.
I saved the best one for last.

1472
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:34.750
This guy has some sort of speech impediment.
He gets blocked.

1473
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:41.290
I can't,
I don't know.
I've never even heard of it.
It's called Tono.
Tonow,

O.
T.
O.
N.
O.
And A.

1475
01:29:45.101 --> 01:29:47.410
I'm actually going to call in the opie and Anthony Show,

1476
01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.340
or if you're an opiate Anthony Fan,
can you please tell them to watch this video?

1477
01:29:51.341 --> 01:29:56.230
Because this is just right up there fucking alley.
Um,

1478
01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.360
this is one of those videos that I wish I could,

1479
01:29:58.570 --> 01:30:01.600
I could see Jim Norton Watch for the first fucking time.

1480
01:30:03.130 --> 01:30:07.690
Just just to hear what the fuck he would say.

England or whatever,
Sweden and shit who listen to this thing.

1485
01:30:16.771 --> 01:30:19.680
Check out the opening Anthony show on a online,

1486
01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.350
I think it's [inaudible] dot com I don't eat well.
You know,

1487
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:24.660
wouldn't it be great if I had the fucking thing?
Just just look for them.

1488
01:30:24.661 --> 01:30:27.270
They're fucking hilarious.
And they got clips.
They have clips up on Youtube.

1489
01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:31.560
Opie and Anthony Show.
They're hilarious.
Look,
look for the baby bird.

1490
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:35.580
That's a nice simple one to get you in into the show.
All right,
questions.

1491
01:30:35.581 --> 01:30:37.770
These are the questions that I'm going to wrap this up.
Question Bill,

1492
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:41.310
where was your first Gig?
My first stand up.
These are all going to stand up.

1493
01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:44.220
Questions a where it was my first standup Gig.

1494
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:48.600
I played Nick's comedy stop in Boston,
Massachusetts on Warrington Street.

1495
01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:54.180
I was in a competition called a fine Boston's funniest college student.

1496
01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:59.310
And every night,
each college had a different night and I went on,

1497
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:03.450
I went up on my night and I did okay.
I didn't do great,

1498
01:31:03.451 --> 01:31:08.070
but I did okay.
And uh,
and that's it.
That's basically the story.

1499
01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:11.280
Cause I know I've told it a million fucking times,
but I was at Nick's comedy.

1500
01:31:11.281 --> 01:31:12.114
Stop.
Yeah.

1501
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:14.063
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1502
01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:19.240
<v 4>Hang on,
I just got a note.
All right.
Ah,</v>

1503
01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:23.250
Jesus Christ.
All right,
let's move on here.
This is what I sorry guys,

1504
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:24.450
I'm really killing them.
I'm out of here.
Phil,

1505
01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.360
did you have to play coffee shops and bars before you could get up,

1506
01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.960
get to the comedy clubs?
Uh,
yes,
yes I did.

1507
01:31:30.961 --> 01:31:32.970
It's always been a grind to become a comedian.
I know you,

1508
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:36.060
comedians nowadays have it way worse where we didn't have bringer shows.

1509
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.760
Some of these dudes what they have to do here in La,
in New York,

1510
01:31:38.761 --> 01:31:41.340
God bless a man cause it was not that fucking difficult.

1511
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.110
It just keeps getting harder.
But uh,
the cream will rise to the top.
Um,

1512
01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:49.650
did I have to play coffee shops?
Yes.
Coffee,
coffee shops,
bars.

1513
01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:55.170
Um,
I know I've told that story where I played the second story clear,

1514
01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:56.100
laid out,
Cleo,

1515
01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.310
<v 0>lay down,
lay down.
Um,</v>

1516
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.420
<v 4>I know I played that.
Uh,
I told that story where I actually did a Gig at a,</v>

1517
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:10.430
at a two story bar where I was performing on the second floor of this bar that

1518
01:32:13.841 --> 01:32:18.430
had screens for windows and right across the street was a carnival and you know

1519
01:32:18.431 --> 01:32:21.790
that ride with at Viking ship just rocks back and forth.

1520
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:26.630
It literally looked like a cock going into you don't like them.

1521
01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:30.730
They do that horrific porno shot where they do the underneath shot of doggy

1522
01:32:30.731 --> 01:32:32.020
style.
That's what it looked like.

1523
01:32:32.021 --> 01:32:37.021
And it was coming right to the window and I was bombing so hard that all I could

1524
01:32:38.561 --> 01:32:43.060
hear was the people screaming on that ride.
All right,
there you go.

1525
01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.150
There's one for you.
And you know it was great.
Was the guy who hosted the show,

1526
01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:48.820
he actually had a lazy eye and you know,

1527
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:53.500
he was really self conscious about it and he went on stage first and he was

1528
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:57.910
bombing and these two people are sitting in the front row and they just didn't

1529
01:32:57.911 --> 01:33:02.140
give a fuck.
This guy just goes,
dude.
And he pointed right at his face.
He goes,

1530
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:07.240
the fuck is wrong with your eye.
And it literally just,

1531
01:33:07.241 --> 01:33:12.160
it was really painful to watch.
I mean,
that guy's lazy.
I was part of the problem,

1532
01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:16.810
part of the low self esteem that made him become a comedian.

1533
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:19.270
Okay.
And then he's like,
I'm going to become a comedian.

1534
01:33:19.271 --> 01:33:20.260
I'm going to get on stage.

1535
01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:24.370
People going to like me and everything's going to end this guy just fucking Bam.

1536
01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.050
And a,
and the dude had nothing.
He was just like,
I can't,

1537
01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.280
I can't believe you just said that.
I said it was bad.

1538
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.610
And then I went on after that and I somehow had even a,

1539
01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:37.840
I had worse moments than that.
Jesus,
he's a lot of bad stories this week.
Alright.

1540
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:40.240
Uh,
Bill,
when did you first open?

1541
01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.050
When did I first move up to the opening spot?
Um,

1542
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:47.770
well I was getting through college,
so my first year was kind of a wash 92.

1543
01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:51.400
I started in March of [inaudible] 92 and I only probably only going to stage a

1544
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.370
half dozen times,
maybe eight times 12 at the most.

1545
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:59.680
And it probably was by mid,

1546
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:05.380
mid 93.
WBCN used to have this,

1547
01:34:05.381 --> 01:34:08.920
this thing called the comedy riot.
And I want it,
you know,

1548
01:34:08.921 --> 01:34:12.870
as for the up and coming guy.
And after I won that,
um,

1549
01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:17.050
I remember that was the first time I got a real spot on a Tuesday night show on

1550
01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:20.530
Jim law.
Let us show,
I got a spot.
Um,

1551
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:25.240
and I remember I was all fucking nervous light cause it wasn't an open mic show.

1552
01:34:25.241 --> 01:34:28.960
I was like,
Oh fuck,
you know,
when I'm going to open up on an open mic show,

1553
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.350
they know I'm an open miker but now they're expecting a professional.

1554
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:37.030
I was fucking unbelievably nervous.
And uh,
that was a huge,

1555
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:41.870
huge fucking night for me when I,
you know,
just doing a spot on a Tuesday.
It's,

1556
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:45.820
it's like that incremental shit.
That's why I flipped out when I was saying,

1557
01:34:45.821 --> 01:34:48.760
you know,
when they say,
oh the fans made Ringo Starr's,
you have no idea.

1558
01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:54.210
Like incrementally the baby steps that you take to get to a higher fucking level

1559
01:34:55.451 --> 01:35:00.200
and how huge little things like that.
Like the first time I got $5 gas money,

1560
01:35:01.010 --> 01:35:04.670
you have to doing it for a year and a half.
I actually got,
you know,

1561
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:08.720
a piece of paper that used to represent gold that really has no fucking value,

1562
01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:10.460
but I didn't know that then.
So I was like,

1563
01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:15.440
I can actually go out with this $5 and get the number three at subway.

1564
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:19.250
This is fucking awesome.
And you know,

1565
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:22.070
I love doing standup so much that I,
I,
you know,

1566
01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:27.130
I would drive to Maine from Boston for free just to get stage time and we'd be

1567
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:28.670
driving all the way back,

1568
01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:31.940
almost falling asleep at the wheel to go to work at eight o'clock in the fucking

1569
01:35:31.941 --> 01:35:33.320
morning to go unload trucks.

1570
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.610
And a was just loving life and a,
it's one of the greatest things about,
you know,

1571
01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:42.020
doing this job as I fucking love it.
So anyways,
um,

1572
01:35:42.021 --> 01:35:45.770
next one is the worth of your career starting.

1573
01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.610
Can you guys hear that fucking weed wacker?
I apologize.
Um,

1574
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:54.350
is the worth of your career starting to weigh out the 20 years struggle of

1575
01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:58.910
making it to the top?
Uh,
well dude,
I haven't made it to the top,
but yeah,
dude,

1576
01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:03.830
um,
it was worth it.
Uh,
the day I got five bucks,

1577
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:07.910
the day I started doing it,
it was with the first fucking day when I drove home,

1578
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:09.250
excited that I actually got,

1579
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:14.270
had the balls to get onstage and I drove home and I was listening to doctor,

1580
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:17.060
not doctor.
I was listening to kickstart my heart.

1581
01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.940
What a child of the 80s,

1582
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:25.390
screaming the song fucking ridiculously pumped up in my little piece of shit

1583
01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:28.460
truck driving home.
I couldn't believe it.

1584
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:31.280
I've failed at everything else and I always thought I was,
you know,

1585
01:36:31.281 --> 01:36:33.710
I always said I was going to do this and I was going to do that and I never

1586
01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:34.520
followed through.

1587
01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.720
And I finally followed through with something that actually went great.
And uh,

1588
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:44.300
from the second I went up on stage and did it,
you know,

1589
01:36:44.301 --> 01:36:48.310
it was worth it and it actually helped me,
you know,

1590
01:36:48.311 --> 01:36:52.220
in other areas like,
um,
like last night,
you know I was,

1591
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:55.250
I went down to go do stand up and these guys were playing afterwards.
He's like,

1592
01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:56.960
Oh I heard you play drums,
you want to sit in.

1593
01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.140
And I got all fucking nervous cause you know,

1594
01:37:00.141 --> 01:37:04.730
I don't do that for a living.
And then I just,
I do,

1595
01:37:04.731 --> 01:37:07.760
what I always do is I just think,
okay,
what's going to feel worse?

1596
01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:13.900
I'm going up there and bombing and sucking and make an ass out of yourself or

1597
01:37:14.211 --> 01:37:15.680
going home,
laying in bed,

1598
01:37:15.681 --> 01:37:19.970
not being able to go to sleep knowing that you are a pussy in that moment when

1599
01:37:19.971 --> 01:37:22.310
you could have gone up there.
So I said fuck it.

1600
01:37:22.311 --> 01:37:25.370
And I went up there and it fucking went great.
You know,

1601
01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:26.990
and plus when you get up there,
there's like,
you know,

1602
01:37:26.991 --> 01:37:28.880
there's always other people who were really good.
In fact,

1603
01:37:28.881 --> 01:37:32.690
everybody else was really good so you can kind of hide behind that fact,

1604
01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:36.140
which is another thing that makes standups so scary is because everyone's

1605
01:37:36.141 --> 01:37:37.550
looking at you the entire time.

1606
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:42.530
You can't blame it on the stool.
Um,
all right,

1607
01:37:42.531 --> 01:37:46.370
here's the last question and then I'm going to start packing to go to Sweden and

1608
01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:47.570
I'll tell you guys all about it.

1609
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:51.950
I'm really going to try to do a podcast next week while I'm out there riding a

1610
01:37:51.951 --> 01:37:55.920
bicycle around Stockholm,
Sweden.
How fucking great is that?

1611
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:59.280
They you go do when you asked me to the 20 year struggle payoff,

1612
01:37:59.370 --> 01:38:02.970
it really wasn't a struggle.
I got to tell you,
cause I fucking,
I love doing it.

1613
01:38:02.971 --> 01:38:06.140
So,
uh,
anyways,
I last thing I built.

1614
01:38:06.141 --> 01:38:08.460
What were your stint new stand up special be called in.

1615
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:11.700
Is there any way physically pos,
any physical,

1616
01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.170
any way physically possible you could save tickets for me.

1617
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:18.370
<v 1>Oh,
Jesus Christ.</v>

1618
01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:19.360
<v 4>I didn't even read this.</v>

1619
01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.590
My brother died a few years back and one of the connections my brother and I had

1620
01:38:23.591 --> 01:38:26.980
was your comedy and Hbo Special.
And whenever I listen to you,
all right dude,

1621
01:38:26.981 --> 01:38:29.470
I gotta,
I gotta I gotta email you back and talk to you about this stuff.

1622
01:38:29.471 --> 01:38:33.880
This is a,
I can't,
I can't,
and this is really getting to set,
okay,
let's,
let's,

1623
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:38.960
<v 1>let's try to keep this up right.
You know that,
that's one of the dangerous,</v>

1624
01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.910
I just read five good questions in a row.
I'm like,

1625
01:38:40.911 --> 01:38:45.320
this guy's fucking great and I didn't read the rest of them.
And uh,

1626
01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.030
you know,
cause then that,
you know what,

1627
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:50.810
cause then that sticks me in a position where people who didn't have a brother

1628
01:38:50.811 --> 01:38:54.530
die are going to go,
oh,
this is a way to get free fucking tickets.
You know,

1629
01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:59.810
it's brutal.
People are scumbags.
Um,
which is why you got to get a dog.

1630
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:02.420
That's why you get,
you gotta get a dog because I swear to God,

1631
01:39:02.421 --> 01:39:06.280
they just stay the fucking love you.
Isn't that right Cleo?
Ah,

1632
01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.950
course it is.
We are going to tell fucking love that God damn animal.

1633
01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:13.910
<v 4>All right.
That's it.
That's,
that's the podcast for this week.
Thank you.</v>

1634
01:39:13.911 --> 01:39:18.620
Thank you everybody for listening.
I'm sorry about moving the date in Ontario,

1635
01:39:18.621 --> 01:39:20.330
but everything else is a go.

1636
01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.140
<v 1>Um,
I am going to be at the,
uh,</v>

1637
01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:26.810
helium comedy club and in Philadelphia.
Uh,

1638
01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:28.920
I don't have the dates in front of me in September.

1639
01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:31.440
And then I'm going to be at the Addison Improv in Dallas,
Texas,

1640
01:39:31.441 --> 01:39:36.441
and I'm going to be going to that Monday night football game at the Dallas

1641
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:38.820
Cowboys Stadium.
And,
uh,
tell you what,
I'm going to do a little thing.

1642
01:39:38.821 --> 01:39:39.091
I'm going to,

1643
01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:43.140
I'm going to try it cause I've been to the new Yankee Stadium and I'll tell you

1644
01:39:43.141 --> 01:39:48.120
how they compare because the new Yankee Stadium was,
uh,
was amazing.
It just,

1645
01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:51.660
um,
it's what the old one should have been like as far.

1646
01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:53.280
They never should have switched it up.

1647
01:39:53.281 --> 01:39:56.080
I just wish when they redid it in the early 70,

1648
01:39:56.081 --> 01:39:59.080
[inaudible] they could've given it to facelift without,
you know,
I don't know.

1649
01:39:59.081 --> 01:40:01.320
It's a long fucking story,
but uh,

1650
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:05.190
but still it's no reason to charge your fans $42 for a fucking hot dog.

1651
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:09.120
So one bit of sympathy I have for Yankee fans is they're really getting raped at

1652
01:40:09.121 --> 01:40:13.830
that ballpark.
Um,
Oh and also fuck I forgot to say this.

1653
01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:16.460
Um,
somebody out there up,

1654
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:19.220
<v 4>Natalie sent me the rams tightened Superbowl.</v>

1655
01:40:19.230 --> 01:40:21.810
They actually gave me a DVD that has the,
the,

1656
01:40:21.811 --> 01:40:26.730
the two games they played prior to it.
I really appreciate that.
And you know,

1657
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:29.400
I got,
you know,
somebody sent me another thing was just all you know,

1658
01:40:29.401 --> 01:40:33.810
hip hop songs and I was thinking that this podcast could be kind of a cool way

1659
01:40:33.811 --> 01:40:37.110
that if it's,
if you're looking for something and you can't fucking find it,

1660
01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:40.700
maybe somebody has it.
And a,

1661
01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:45.240
I will be the interface to use commute computer,
a savvy shit.

1662
01:40:45.241 --> 01:40:47.880
If you want to throw out your email,
if there's something you looking for,

1663
01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:51.630
if there's a Superbowl you missed and somebody has a copy,
I don't fucking know.

1664
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.650
Why don't you use this podcast

1665
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.200
<v 1>to do that?
I'll throw something out there.</v>

1666
01:40:56.201 --> 01:40:59.250
And you know what else I forgot to talk about was the Kegger rater.

1667
01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:03.940
Somebody remind me,
send me an email next Sunday night.

1668
01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:09.340
Okay.
This Sunday night,
say,
Bill,
don't forget to talk about the keg rater,

1669
01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:12.760
which is basically your refrigerator that only holds a keg,

1670
01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:17.950
which I did not know existed until recently.
And,

1671
01:41:17.951 --> 01:41:21.880
uh,
I have to admit,
I'm pretty,
I'm pretty enamored with it.

1672
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:25.910
All right?
And that's it.
That's the Monday morning podcast.
God bless all of,

1673
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:27.790
and I'll talk to you next Monday.

1674
01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:28.280
<v 7>All right.</v>

1675
01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.280
[inaudible].
