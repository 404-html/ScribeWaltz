00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.280
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:09.050
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.050
just checking in on you mother fuckers.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.090
Um,
Jesus Christ.
It is three 48 in the morning.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.190
I'm a little jet lagged here,
knocking out the podcast.

6
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:26.970
I just did a two shows on a,

7
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:29.640
what would be a Tuesday and Wednesday here in Liverpool.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.950
And um,
at the Liverpool Philharmonic,

9
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.290
they had a little drum kit back there.
I didn't have any earplugs.

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.030
I didn't realize that they were going to give me one,

11
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:43.200
so messed around on it a little bit,
but the fucking crowds were amazing.

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.930
All of my jokes seem to be working on this side of the pond.

13
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.130
There were a couple of things that I had to make minor adjustments to.

14
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.990
Um,

15
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.460
<v 1>okay.</v>

16
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.710
<v 0>One of the lines people don't get,</v>

17
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:01.980
but I'm leaving it in the fucking special anyways.
I don't give a shit,

18
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.420
but this thing's ready to go.
I am very excited,

19
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:10.260
very relaxed.
I'm in a great place and um,

20
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
I want to thank everybody who came out on a school night Tuesday and Wednesday.

21
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.620
I could not have had a better time.
And thank you to uh,

22
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.190
Chris cans who opened up for me.
Um,

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.390
<v 1>yeah,</v>

24
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.100
<v 0>I had a great time working with him.
He fucking killed both shows.
Um,</v>

25
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.710
which I always like.
I hate doing a show where,
you know,

26
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.850
I like it wire to wire,
everybody does a good job.

27
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.930
So there's none of that bathroom break bullshit.
Um,

28
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.240
while people are on stage,
you know,
so underrated Liverpool,

29
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.220
beautiful Goddamn city also helped that the weather was perfect.

30
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.440
Um,
I guess,
you know,
it's usually gloomy and rainy around these parts,

31
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:56.920
but uh,

32
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.920
we got to sunny days and tonight Liverpool had a game and people still came out

33
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:05.560
to my show,
which was very flattering.
And uh,

34
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:10.561
I kinda got all back into the whole premier league shit as a Liverpool one.

35
00:02:10.571 --> 00:02:13.390
So I guess you get three points for winning.
And last I checked,

36
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:17.470
they were like one point ahead of Man City.
All right.

37
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.000
Now this is what's interesting.

38
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.290
Liverpool is backed by American dollars.

39
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.240
<v 0>All right.</v>

41
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.240
Man City is backed by Saudi and Saudi Arabian money.

42
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.950
Now we buy oil from Saudi Arabia.

43
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.280
So in a lot of a bunch of it sold in a lot of ways.

44
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:42.310
They're also in a round about way back

45
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.950
by American dollars.

46
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.390
<v 0>But for what I heard,</v>

48
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:52.800
rumor has it is we got more oil in our country at this point than they do.

49
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.020
So I don't know how to do this fucking math.

50
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.060
All I know is the owner of the Red Sox owns uh,

51
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.290
Liverpool and you didn't realize how fucking insane it would be if the owner of

52
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.291
the red sox owned him right through the curse of the babe ended that curse.

53
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.500
And from what I heard,
Liverpool is never won the premier championship.

54
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.620
There's 10 fucking games left.

55
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.440
So all they gotta do is keep winning.
There's no playoffs,

56
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.380
which playoffs,

57
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.400
which blows my mind because they're leaving so much money on the table.

58
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.780
Like who am I as an employee?
My thing,
who am I as an American?

59
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.560
This is what Americans do.
It's what fucking English people do.

60
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:42.010
You barge in and you fucking put your own ideas and somebody else's foreign

61
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.800
lands.
So why not?
You guys got to have a play off.

62
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.310
This is like college football all over again.

63
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.620
Everybody would pitch at the end of the fucking year.

64
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400
It's a little bit different.
That's actually,
it's a lot different.

65
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:59.030
It actually kind of makes sense,
but
I dunno,
call me a stupid American,

66
00:03:59.031 --> 00:04:03.270
but if they had a fucking playoff,
like what?
What if you know,

67
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.230
I mean you,
if you play all fucking year and,
and,

68
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:12.231
and you lose by one point so you don't get the championship year one point less.

69
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:17.511
Let's say it ended today in Liverpool Beats Man City by one point.

70
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:21.810
What if they just fucking had one more game?

71
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.400
The top two teams?

72
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.730
<v 1>Okay,</v>

73
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.970
<v 0>well what if they had a special thing that if the top two teams,</v>

74
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.760
if you're within five fucking points,

75
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.110
if you're in second place by five points of or less,

76
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.320
you've earned a playoff game and they play a one game winner takes fucking all.

77
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.420
All right.

78
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.290
You're going to tell me like how many fucking people are going to tune in for

79
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.400
that,
you know,

80
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.930
instead of having all these fucking games going on at the same time,
hey bill,

81
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.220
you know,
I don't know if you've noticed,

82
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.260
but the league's pretty fucks me successful.

83
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:59.080
We really don't need your fucking ideas.
I don't know.
Sorry.

84
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.670
I just grew up with playoffs.
Playoffs.
Um,

85
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.890
so anyways,
uh,
that's fucking was pretty exciting.

86
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.170
And the next time I really got into it,
you know,

87
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.980
everybody was walking around today with the scarves on and saw this guy with a

88
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.600
suit on.
He was going to work,
but he's still at a white shirt on with a red tie.

89
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.350
Clearly s like supporting his team.
Like people were fucking into it.

90
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:27.550
It killed me.
It killed me to not go to that game.
Obviously.

91
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:30.220
I did had a great time doing the show,
but like,

92
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.980
just to know that that was right there.
Most sal is played in these fucking,

93
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.890
like the Wayne Gretzky,
a soccer right now,

94
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.660
and I'd have a chance to see another great athlete live.

95
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.640
Um,
next time I come back,
I'm going to be drinking.

96
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.350
I figured out do a one off show here the day before,
the day after.

97
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:54.820
Probably the day after.
It'd be better if there was a game right now.
Wait,

98
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.770
do the show first and then,
then I do the game.

99
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.200
Then I get all banged up and I go to the fucking game and I'll put a bunch of

100
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.910
money on Liverpool.
That way I'll give a fuck.
Um,

101
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.980
I still don't understand why the defense is allowed to stop fucking running.

102
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.880
And then you're off sides.

103
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.460
<v 0>It,
if that's the case,</v>

105
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:17.720
why don't you just put four fat lady's back on defense that can't fucking run

106
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.200
and then they'd never get near your net.
Right.

107
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.660
Just have him sitting down in the grass playing with the fucking daisies.

108
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.070
I don't get it.
Uh,
whatever.
Somebody will explain it to me.
Um,

109
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.400
so,
uh,
I got to tell you about a,

110
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.360
a little medical episode that I had.

111
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.330
So I flew over here from New York City.
I don't remember if I,
I was so fucked up.

112
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:47.020
I don't remember if I even told you this.
Did I,

113
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:48.920
I did I already tell the story about almost,
well,

114
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:52.100
I figured out why I almost fainted in the elevator.
Right.

115
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.350
I already told you this stuff's right.
Told it on Monday.

116
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.570
Recap real quickly is I,
I,

117
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.390
the day after I flew from New York to La,
I mean to,
uh,

118
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.460
to Manchester took the train over to Liverpool.
Um,

119
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.500
they had a fucking steam and they had a sauna and I went into the sauna and I

120
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.170
was in there and I wasn't sweating.
I'm just like,
it didn't feel hot.
I'm like,

121
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.670
what the fuck?
This fucking thing sucks.

122
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.670
And then I went to the steam and I was like,
all right,
this is better.

123
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:21.830
And then when I left,
I had to walk up a flight of stairs.

124
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:23.090
When I got to the elevator,
like,
dude,

125
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:27.200
I almost went down like the closest I've come to fainting

126
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.470
ever other than from alcohol,
just don't wanna fucking face plant.
So

127
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.870
I was blaming their sauna,

128
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.320
thinking it was that shit that heat you up from the inside.

129
00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:42.780
And I didn't realize how fucking hot I was,
but,
uh,

130
00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:47.610
when I told a few people what happened,
um,
it was,

131
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.720
I was dehydrated from f I don't think I drank enough water when I was in New

132
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.040
York,
so it was already a little dehydrated.

133
00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:56.040
Then I got on a seven hour fuck six and a half,
seven hour flight,

134
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.950
and then didn't drink water and then took a sauna and a fucking steam.
So,

135
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.750
and then all my symptoms,
like I fucking,
when I went into the locker room,

136
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.890
I was by myself and all of a sudden I was like,
oh my God,

137
00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:11.880
I got to fucking sit down.
And then I was like dry heaving.

138
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.950
And I was like,
oh my God,
what the fuck I'm going to Puke.

139
00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:19.440
And then I didn't puke and there was nobody in the locker room.

140
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.790
And then after that,

141
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.880
<v 2>then all of a sudden it wanted to come out the other end,</v>

142
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.330
not to get fucking gross.
But,
uh,
it did.

143
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.200
And I think that toilet is retired.
And,
and somebody told me,
he said,

144
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.350
all of these are signs.
You were dehydrated.
You're dehydrated.

145
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.380
I saw I was dehydrated before I took a fucking sauna and a steam and my dumb ass

146
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:45.590
almost fucking passed out.
Did I tell you this story?
I can't remember.

147
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.240
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

148
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.460
<v 0>no wait.
I didn't,
I didn't.</v>

149
00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:54.570
That's right because I had to show that night and when I did the show there was

150
00:08:54.571 --> 00:08:58.830
a couple of,
when I,
I ramped up the energy and I was like touching my toes,

151
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:01.260
doing something.
I came back up fast.
I was like,
Oh fuck,

152
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:06.180
am I going to pass out right here on stage?
Um,
dude,
I got on the fucking elevator

153
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.740
and this other guy going out with me and I was just leaning

154
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.280
<v 1>okay</v>

155
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.140
<v 0>on the fucking like armrest there,
the rail and I was just staring at the ground.</v>

156
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.900
And you know that deal when you think you're going to faint and you just trying

157
00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:23.260
to keep yourself cool and every time you think he hit the top like,
okay,

158
00:09:23.261 --> 00:09:26.020
I can deal with this,
I can maintain my consciousness.

159
00:09:26.021 --> 00:09:29.500
It goes a little higher and you're like,
Oh fuck,
oh fuck,
hang in there.

160
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.470
And I can't remember if the dude was talking to me or not.

161
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.220
I think he said something to people.
And I got off,
I got off at the wrong floor,

162
00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:39.430
so I had to walk down a flight of stairs and I got to the first set of first

163
00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:43.720
step and just sat down.
And then the guy looked at me,
he goes,

164
00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:46.750
are you okay?
All right.

165
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.430
Now if I was a woman,
I would be like,
no,
I need help.

166
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.220
I have a family and a child that's depending on me to not die.
Right?

167
00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.190
But I'm a man.
So of course I said,
yeah,
I'm fine.

168
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.420
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

169
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.930
<v 0>dude,
I was,
I was not fine.
Yeah.
And He,
you know,</v>

170
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:11.400
he's a guy.
So he's like,
all right,

171
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.160
well this is emotionally weird to deal with this with another guy.

172
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:15.150
And he just fucking left.

173
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.860
So I sat on the fucking stairs for like,
I dunno,

174
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:21.420
like another like minute.

175
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.920
And I slowly walked down the stairs and I just,
uh,

176
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:32.040
I,
uh,
made it into the,
the hotel room.
And at that point I,

177
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:36.330
uh,
I asked club Soda Kenny,
I just texted him,
said,

178
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:38.640
bring me a Gatorade and some fucking waters and shit.

179
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.400
So I just pounded that and I was all right,
but Jesus Christ,

180
00:10:41.401 --> 00:10:45.810
all freckles almost went down all freckle get,
here's one for you.

181
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.570
If you're a fucking dumb ass like me,

182
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.860
and you get on a plane and fly for six hours more or more and you're already

183
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:56.670
dehydrated yet,
don't go take a fucking sauna.
And then two,

184
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.480
I took two steams cause I was like,
that song has not doing shit.

185
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:02.520
And then when I went into the steam room,
I thought I was sweating.

186
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:07.410
It was just the fucking steam.
And then I went back in again.
Fucking idiot.

187
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.543
Um,

188
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:09.700
<v 1>yeah,</v>

189
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.780
<v 0>but other than that,
I had a great time here.
Uh,
you know,</v>

190
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:16.930
checked out the Beatles statue.
I did a couple of like touristy things.

191
00:11:16.931 --> 00:11:18.960
But other than that,
I just tried to walk around and look at it.

192
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:21.670
A lot of beautiful buildings and everything.
Really,
really great city.

193
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.710
And the people were cool as shit.
And I kept striking out with the food though.

194
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.280
Jesus Christ.
I ate at this fucking Italian place.

195
00:11:30.281 --> 00:11:33.400
Who the fucking hell fucking asshole gets Italian in Liverpool,
England.

196
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.650
I wouldn't,
I ordered these fucking,
I got some oysters cause you know,

197
00:11:38.651 --> 00:11:43.120
I'm trying to keep my figure for my special.
So what are some oysters?
Okay.

198
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.300
And I'm thinking,
you know,
there's water right here,
these oysters gotta be fresh.

199
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.910
Did that taste fresh at all?
And then I got one of those,
those uh,
you know,

200
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:53.830
it was rice balls tines make.
It's like it's fucking rice.

201
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:56.290
It's almost like result was going to cheese in it and then they deep fry it.

202
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:58.570
It's fucking,
that was my little,
that was my cheat meal.
Right.

203
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.030
So I order those things that shows up with like truffles on it.

204
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:02.480
It was the blandest.
Yeah.

205
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.390
I never sent back food and I just don't have the fucking

206
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.210
courage to do it because you guys send me in stories about sending back food and

207
00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:15.290
like what happens?

208
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.190
Cause I'm always of the belief they're going to get mad at you and then they're

209
00:12:20.191 --> 00:12:24.510
going to spit on your food.
But like these fucking things was so bad.

210
00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:26.070
There was like there was no fixing it.

211
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.640
<v 0>You know what I mean?
It's not like,
oh hey this is medium rare.</v>

213
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:31.690
Could you make it medium?

214
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:35.500
It's just like this tastes like the person who cooked it doesn't know how to

215
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:36.334
cook.

216
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.240
Is this bring your fucking six year old to work day and they fucking made my

217
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.960
rice balls here
and I just was like,

218
00:12:44.961 --> 00:12:47.440
you know what?
I'm not fucking eat.
This is,
this is how rebellion,

219
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.110
this is the most rebellious I've ever been in a restaurant because I worked in

220
00:12:51.111 --> 00:12:55.610
one and I never want,
I always tip well even if they fucking suck.
So I,

221
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.110
<v 1>okay.</v>

222
00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.710
<v 0>I ate one of them and I was just like,</v>

223
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.770
I am not going to out of politeness and how my parents raised me to not waste

224
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:06.620
food,

225
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.370
eat these other five fucking things and then have to get on an elliptical and

226
00:13:10.371 --> 00:13:12.170
work off something that I didn't even enjoy.

227
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:17.171
So I just set it to the fucking side and eight my fishing oysters and the

228
00:13:18.711 --> 00:13:23.510
waitress came back around and she goes,
okay.
She's like,
how was everything?

229
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.080
And I said,
what?
I always say great.
It was all great.
It was awesome.

230
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.470
And she's looking clearly seeing that I barely touched it.
She goes,

231
00:13:30.471 --> 00:13:33.630
everything was fine.
And I was like,
yeah it was great.
Can I just get the check?

232
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.210
And that was it.
So the upside is with,

233
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.040
with being dehydrated

234
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.070
in almost puking and shitting in fucking eating the shit food over here.
I,
I,

235
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.500
I've actually dropped some pounds cause laid off the booze doesn't hurt either.

236
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.083
Um,

237
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.670
so anyways isn't a thing I learned by the way.

238
00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.950
I'm just gonna keep saying anyways cause I can't stop saying it.

239
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.000
I like to think it's part of my charm.
Um,

240
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.350
I've always wanted to go to that t t race since I found out about him about six,

241
00:14:08.351 --> 00:14:09.184
seven years ago

242
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.580
and I keep trying to book myself on the Isle of man and they just don't have

243
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:17.820
shows there.
I don't know what the deal is,

244
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.570
why they don't know who I am and they don't give a fuck.
I don't know what it is.

245
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:27.000
And I just realized today looking at the map that Liverpool is like 45 fucking

246
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:28.620
minutes flight away.

247
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.400
So I'm thinking of maybe at some point doing a one off show here and flying over

248
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.430
and seeing that race before.
You know,

249
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:43.320
people who don't race motorcycles and don't watch motorcycle racing are so

250
00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:45.420
outraged by it that they shut it down.

251
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.523
<v 1>MMM.</v>

252
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:49.081
<v 0>You know,</v>

253
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:53.540
those are the same fucking people who to get fighting out of hockey and they

254
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:53.781
just,

255
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:58.781
they just tried to ruin any sort of gladiator thing that is left in society.

256
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.540
You know what I mean?
Um,
oh,

257
00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:06.810
the latest dead person that people are going been going after.

258
00:15:06.811 --> 00:15:10.020
They went after John Wayne.
Now they just,
they went after,
I think Bill Hicks.

259
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.210
It's the stupidest shit ever.

260
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.650
All these white people trying to show how fucking progressive they are by

261
00:15:16.651 --> 00:15:20.460
keeping the limelight off of them and all the mistakes they've made socially in

262
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.230
their lives.
By now,

263
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.400
I think they've attacked all the white people they can get that are alive now.

264
00:15:26.401 --> 00:15:29.280
They're going after dead people,
dead white people.

265
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.270
Apparently Davy Crockett was a piece of shit.

266
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.440
I just don't,
well,
how is that helping anything
you don't,

267
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.670
not to mention,
it's just astounding.
Lee White thing to do.

268
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.590
To think that you have to go back in history to find people like that and then

269
00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:53.280
it's up to you to redefine how we are perceiving these five.

270
00:15:53.281 --> 00:15:55.320
Why don't you deal with what the fuck's going on now?

271
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.040
That's another really cringe worthy thing.
You know when people,

272
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.310
I can't believe in 2019 well that's because you're white.

273
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.110
I'm sorry.
It's just,
I don't,

274
00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.290
I'm just so sick of these fucking lefty whities patting themselves on the

275
00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:14.230
fucking back,
you know,
with all of this shit,

276
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.130
you know,
acting like they're fucking doing something.
It's like,
listen,

277
00:16:18.131 --> 00:16:19.240
if you want to get involved,

278
00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:22.180
there's plenty of groups that you can join that go and just,

279
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.870
you can physically take time out of your fucking life to go do something.

280
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.920
Stop Fucking,
I dunno,
I'm just,
you know,

281
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:33.490
remember that guy used to do the fucking humble brags.
The guy passed away.

282
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.320
He was still around him.

283
00:16:35.321 --> 00:16:38.620
Maybe he would do another one that had to do with the humble bragging,
but like,

284
00:16:38.621 --> 00:16:42.280
it's also like a social way.
Woke bragging or some shit.
I don't know what it is.

285
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.270
Um,
so anyways,
um,

286
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:52.270
I actually miss,
I misunderstood when the,
when the,
um,

287
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.960
the thing for Brody was going to be,
uh,
Brody Stevens is going to be,

288
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.410
um,
I don't why I'm announcing this thing here because it's just for family and

289
00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:04.930
comedians.
They're going to shut down the comedy store,

290
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.460
the shutting the whole fucking thing down,
not making any money that night.

291
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:12.190
This is what this guy meant to the comedy store.

292
00:17:12.191 --> 00:17:13.570
And everybody that knew and loved them,

293
00:17:13.571 --> 00:17:17.500
this shutting down the entire fucking comedy club,
March 11th,

294
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.420
and we're going to have a big night remembering him telling stories and all
that.

295
00:17:22.421 --> 00:17:23.920
It's going to be fucking unbelievable.

296
00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:28.921
And I feel so thankful that I'm actually going to be in town when this goes down

297
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:33.910
and I can't wait to,
uh,
to go down there and be a part of that.

298
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.770
And,
um,
what else did I want to say about that?

299
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

300
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.620
<v 0>I can't fucking remember.
I'm just fucking half half asleep here.
Oh yeah.</v>

301
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:47.680
I was also able to call and Brody,
you know,

302
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.750
obviously did a podcast for the all things comedy network and I was talking to

303
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:57.960
one of the people over there and they said today that over 100,

304
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:03.860
say that again.
100 people showed up,
um,

305
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.670
to be on his final podcasts.
All went over,
drove themselves over there,

306
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:12.420
called in ice,
skyped in.
And,
um,

307
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.780
it just really goes to show you,
uh,
like,
you know,

308
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.400
I don't think I've ever seen that.
You know,

309
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.530
unfortunately I've seen a lot of people pass away,
but like,
um,

310
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.080
this guy really touched a lot of people,
so you know,

311
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:31.680
if you can take a positive out of something,
so fucking sad that is,
uh,

312
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.750
that would definitely be it.

313
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.190
So I imagine at this point if I actually had the advertising,
I would read some.

314
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.370
So I'm just going to say,
Hey,
I'm going to the,
uh,

315
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:45.000
the advertising now and this is where we will edit it in.

316
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:52.430
All right.
And now we're back.
We're back to the podcast here.
Um,

317
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.560
what else is there to talk about?
I'm going to Glasgow now.

318
00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:02.480
What I love about Glasgow aside for the fact that I love,
I love Scotland,

319
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.553
um,

320
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.950
is I'm a huge ACDC fan and old ACD DC fans like myself all know that the live

321
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:20.580
album,
if you want blood,
you got it was recorded in Glasgow

322
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.850
and I are for years would listen to that song,
the Jack

323
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.660
and uh,
when Bond Scott Sang,
she told me she was a virgin.

324
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.480
He would say something.
I couldn't,
I any versions,
whatever,

325
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:41.790
I could never understood.
Stand what he was saying.

326
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:45.150
He was actually saying any virgins in Glasgow,
Glasgow,

327
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.500
I believe that's what he's saying.
And I never,
and when I finally went,
okay,

328
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.160
<v 1>okay,</v>

329
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.510
<v 0>I thought it was Glasgow,</v>

330
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.410
so I wasn't saying it right then it went there and I heard how they said at

331
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:59.500
Glasgow,
all of a sudden it just clicked in my head going,
wait a minute,

332
00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.050
is this where they fucking recorded that?

333
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.910
So of course I had to figure out where the theater was that they recorded it and

334
00:20:06.911 --> 00:20:08.800
I'm like,
I got to fucking play there.

335
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.610
I got to tell my shit jokes where the greatest rock band,

336
00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:16.420
as far as I'm concerned,
rock and roll band ever performed

337
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.530
one of the greatest rock alive rock albums ever.

338
00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.960
And unfortunately I looked it up and it was uh,

339
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:31.020
it no longer exists.
Uh,
speaking of which,
when you come here to,

340
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:34.210
to Liverpool,
they have,
uh,

341
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.870
the club where the Beatles played like 200 shows,

342
00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:39.670
like some of their first 200 shows.

343
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.890
And now that I am an experienced tourist,
I said to the driver,
I said,

344
00:20:44.891 --> 00:20:48.340
now is this the original place is the exact place,

345
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.270
because I remember when I was in London and everybody has a stupid Abbey road

346
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:55.060
thing where you walking across the street,
I want to be John,
I want to be Paul.

347
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.360
That's not the same crosswalk crosswalk has been moved.

348
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:03.280
So you're not standing where they stood.
Okay.
So I asked,

349
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.660
I'm like,
okay,
now that fucking crosswalk bullshit,
I did that.

350
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.520
And it turned out that they fucking,
you know,
that wasn't where they were.

351
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.980
That was this club really the place where John Paul Ringo and George all played

352
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.850
their first 200 shows that the cavern club or something like that.

353
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.780
And the guy goes,
he's like,
yeah,
no,
no.
It isn't a

354
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.740
place where they originally played.
It's like a fucking hotel now,

355
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:35.710
but this is close.
It's on the street.

356
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:39.580
So the best thing you could do is you can walk down the street where they walked

357
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.160
to go to a club that no longer exists.

358
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:45.220
But when you go into the club that they say is the club,

359
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.540
it's not the fucking club.
Oh,
did I take a picture?
I gotta I gotta

360
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.920
I don't want to fucking hurt anybody's business here,
but I was with the,

361
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.600
uh,
Andrew [inaudible].

362
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.770
He sees like shooting stuff for my patrion page on this tour.

363
00:22:01.771 --> 00:22:06.020
And we getting ready for my special and uh,
we went to go,

364
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.090
you know,
he's a huge Beatles fan.

365
00:22:08.091 --> 00:22:11.480
So we went down there and we were checking out a,

366
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.710
all of these,
uh,
uh,
come on.
Did I take a picture of it?
Fuck,

367
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:21.540
I didn't take a picture.
S God dammit.
We went to this,

368
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.640
this Beatles Museum,
okay.
Now,

369
00:22:25.641 --> 00:22:27.320
if you're trying to attract people,

370
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.650
it's if you have artifacts from the Beatles,

371
00:22:30.651 --> 00:22:34.650
which you want to do is have like a couple of year,

372
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.090
not year,
your best ones,
you want to keep your best ones in there also,

373
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.400
it's a let down,
but you got to put something from your top five out front.

374
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.840
So we go to walk into this fucking museum because I want to go in and I was

375
00:22:49.971 --> 00:22:51.740
like,
all right,
all right.
And he goes,
you don't where to go.

376
00:22:51.741 --> 00:22:53.930
And I go listen to it.
You're fucking huge Beatle fans.

377
00:22:53.931 --> 00:22:55.240
I don't want to ruin this for you.
Let's fucking go.

378
00:22:55.241 --> 00:23:00.241
And so we go to walk up the steps to go in and I swear to God they have this

379
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.900
mannequin that they dressed like John Lennon and it was just a mannequin and it

380
00:23:08.931 --> 00:23:13.490
had the all white suit that he had.
And it wasn't the white suit,

381
00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:14.810
it was just a white suit.

382
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:19.550
And they glued or taped a beard to a mannequin space and put this off a fucking

383
00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:20.150
wig on it.

384
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.440
It looked like me when I dress up to do the comedy jam and I just started

385
00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:28.370
laughing and I was just like,
Andrew,
I go look at this fucking thing.

386
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.520
If this is what they have to get you in there,

387
00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:32.930
what the fuck do they have in there?

388
00:23:32.931 --> 00:23:35.330
And he just started laughing and we were just like,
all right,
fuck it,

389
00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:39.130
let's get out of here.
So I think,
I think we made the right move on that one.
Uh,

390
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.870
but they did have a lot of cool stuff and we went to another place that,

391
00:23:41.871 --> 00:23:43.810
a bunch of cool t shirts and shit.
I tried to sign,

392
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.360
find something for my daughter,
actually couldn't find anything,
but uh,

393
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:48.310
I got to get her something.

394
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.263
<v 4>But,
um,</v>

395
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.110
<v 0>I am excited in a couple of days cause I'm,
I'm flying on,
you know,</v>

396
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.860
have family over here and I can't wait.

397
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.933
<v 4>MMM.</v>

398
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.650
<v 0>To see my Kiddo.
I signed up for Skype and that's been a good thing.</v>

399
00:24:01.651 --> 00:24:03.570
So I talked to her like three times a day

400
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:05.930
<v 4>and uh,</v>

401
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.880
<v 0>yeah,
she's Hilarious,
but it's just killing me.
This stuff I'm missing.</v>

402
00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:10.720
Like this morning,

403
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:16.600
my wife was putting socks on her and they had a little teddy bear on it and she

404
00:24:16.601 --> 00:24:18.250
pointed at,
and she goes,
teddy bear.

405
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:23.050
And my wife was surprised cause she didn't know she could say that.
And she goes,

406
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.850
my wife goes,
that's right,
teddy bear.

407
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.470
And then my daughter just put it right hand up and she goes,
hi,
five

408
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.550
like fucking bore at.
And my wife said,
she fucking like,
oh,

409
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.360
like just keeled over laughing.
And what's awesome is my daughter.
Like,

410
00:24:40.361 --> 00:24:44.670
she understands that Shit's funny now.
So now it's the cutest thing ever.

411
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.580
She laughs and after she left she goes,
funny.
It's just,

412
00:24:48.581 --> 00:24:51.040
it's the greatest thing ever and it's killing me that I'm out here.

413
00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:55.060
So thank you to whoever invented Skype and facetime and all that.
So that's,

414
00:24:55.061 --> 00:24:56.090
that's been helping me out.

415
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:57.880
<v 4>But,
um,</v>

416
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.550
<v 0>no,
coming down to the end of it here,
I got a,
uh,</v>

417
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.480
I got to kill a new hour that I'm very proud of and I can't wait to fucking

418
00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:10.290
unleash this and let it go.
And then just see,
you know,

419
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.760
you know,
where the next hour leads me.
Uh,
and with that,

420
00:25:14.761 --> 00:25:18.160
I got to give a shout out here to an amazing musician I saw tonight,
uh,

421
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.750
Victoria Sharp.
I was in this cigar bar.

422
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:26.370
I wasn't going to smoke a cigar before my,
uh,
special,
but I had,

423
00:25:26.371 --> 00:25:29.130
I kind of gave in,
I just had to go have one.
You know,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.360
Her Instagram is at Victoria Sharp,
s h a r.
P.

429
00:25:45.361 --> 00:25:48.960
E music.
And um,

430
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.700
she was on the piano and like,
she was so fucking good.

431
00:25:53.701 --> 00:25:56.130
It sounded like she was in the other room cause they didn't want to have her

432
00:25:56.131 --> 00:25:58.140
enough playing piano while everybody was smoking.

433
00:25:58.141 --> 00:26:02.090
So she was in the smoke free and she's playing it,
you know,

434
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.540
she came around and she had this whole list of songs,
anything,

435
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.050
any signs like fucking like 200 fucking songs it seems,

436
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.920
but she just went in and I didn't realize she started playing and after they

437
00:26:10.921 --> 00:26:13.080
just sound like the same artists over and over again.

438
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.550
I finally left the guys I was with,

439
00:26:14.551 --> 00:26:17.700
I saying is that that woman who was just talking to it was so good.

440
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:20.820
It sounded like a,
like a recording.
Um,

441
00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.800
she actually at one point sang happy birthday to this do Jamie who came out to

442
00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:26.634
the show

443
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.533
<v 4>and</v>

444
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.950
<v 0>she's saying it's so good.
I actually,
this is the first time ever been like,
yeah,</v>

445
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.580
happy birthday.
So really good song.

446
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.490
Like she made happy birthday sound like a fucking hit song.

447
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.580
So if you ever get a chance to see or check out our music,

448
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:45.581
she's on a Instagram at Victoria with an e at Victoria Sharp music.

449
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.520
Um,
check her out.
And uh,

450
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.900
I mean she seems like she'd be perfect to at the of a private party and you just

451
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:58.470
want to kill a musician that just plays piano and can just crush it doing that.

452
00:26:58.471 --> 00:27:00.750
It's not intrusive,
but it adds to the atmosphere.

453
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.960
Can't say enough good things about her.
And she was cool as shit when I met her.

454
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:09.020
All right.
So anyways,
thank you to everybody who came out here in Liverpool,
uh,

455
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.570
could not have had a great,
better time.

456
00:27:10.571 --> 00:27:13.560
And it was a fucking honor to be here and looking forward to going back to

457
00:27:13.561 --> 00:27:17.880
Scotland.
Been to Glasgow a couple of times,
haven't been in awhile.
So,
uh,

458
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.130
those fucking lunatics,
Scottish people are fucking lunatics.
I love them.
So,

459
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:26.580
um,
then after that we go to Manchester,
then I think Birmingham,

460
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.360
and then it's off to London and all freckles does this special.

461
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:34.080
I'm getting really fucking excited for this.
So,
uh,
that's it.
Enjoy the music.

462
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.630
And then we have

463
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.990

466
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:25.370

467
00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.720
45.

468
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:41.220
<v 7>Hey,

It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

469
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:45.090
February 28th,

470
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.760
2011 and uh,
that's it for this month.

471
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.270
Pay Your fucking rent still tomorrow.
All right.
Oh,

472
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:54.990
you pot heads out there sitting on the couch.
Me.

473
00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.050
Whoa.
Is it like February?
I like making fun of potheads.
They,

474
00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:04.780
they're really fucking defensive individuals.
Um,

475
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.280
every once in a while I make fun of potheads on here and I get a plethora of

476
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:11.420
emails.
Speaking of emails.
Uh,

477
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.790
if you'd like to send an email to the podcast,
uh,

478
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.570
send it to bill at the [inaudible] podcast.com.
That's the new email bill.

479
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.480
Bi B as in bill,

480
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:26.190
I l l@themmpodcast.com.
All right.

481
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.600
And uh,
yeah,
I make fun of the fucking potheads I make fun of them.

482
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:32.970
I was actually having a,
I mean I don't give a shit if you do it or not.

483
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.780
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck if that's your ritual.

484
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.400
That's what you have to do.

485
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.030
Do what you judge between having a beer and smoking a joint at the end of the

486
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.540
day.
Huh?
Why don't you answer that one day?
A freckle face.

487
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.680
I'll tell you what the difference is.
What I'm doing is legal.

488
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.170
What your doing is doubt.

489
00:29:53.171 --> 00:29:56.770
You throw your pot smoking fucking hands in the air.

490
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.770
Let me finish my point.
All right.

491
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.120
You hemp shirt wearing motherfucker.

492
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.560
Um,
yeah,
that's the difference.
That's the only difference.

493
00:30:10.561 --> 00:30:12.910
Cause I don't even think like as far as health goes,

494
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:16.210
I was going to say health wise,
but that,
that word doesn't exist.

495
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:20.900
And I remember from my vocab improvement class way back in high school,
um,

496
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.210
this guy used to talk about the wise guys health wise,
sports wise,

497
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:28.990
weather wise,
the wise guys that those words do not exist.

498
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:34.070
Although lately,
ladies,
um,
lately,
uh,

499
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.640
the dictionaries just said fuck it.
You know,

500
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:41.641
we can't keep up with the overwhelming level of stupid people using words that

501
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:47.170
we say don't exist.
And then they just give in,
you know,
like they'll make lol,

502
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:52.500
oh,
like a legitimate word,
little abbreviation,
baby laugh out loud.

503
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.330
Initially sleet,
all the little,
the two pills and flurry,

504
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:59.050
they'll do shit like that.
You know,
that's a bad example.
But then again,

505
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:03.010
I'm not exactly a great host.
All right.
Do you want something better?

506
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:07.870
Go to another fucking podcast.
I don't need you.
Your attitudes.

507
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:13.030
The hell was I talking about?
Oh,
I was talking about weed.
Um,

508
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.260
the difference,
the difference.
I was talking to a buddy of mine last night.

509
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:22.000
We were out in a sports bath.
Um,
we're actually watched the,
uh,

510
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:26.380
the Celtics clippers great game and it's awesome to see the clippers are good.

511
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:28.810
And I'm also really,
really,

512
00:31:28.811 --> 00:31:33.040
really nervous about getting rid of Kendrick Perkins.
I don't get that.

513
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:37.270
I just felt a big sigh of relief from everybody on the,
uh,

514
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.750
on the Lakers bench.
Oh,
thank God.

515
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:45.670
We don't have to deal with that guy fucking making us be men,
you know,

516
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.940
bitch slap in us and it's fucking paint like we deserve.

517
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.220
That's why pog assaults face is so fucking thin.

518
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.850
He took a slap from Perkins on both side of is hey,
give him a double.

519
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.450
You remember killer Khan?
He gave him one of those,
uh,

520
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.660
during the first time we met him in the finals and then he had that deer in the,

521
00:32:01.661 --> 00:32:05.740
I look for the rest of the fucking series.
That's what happened.
Um,
and we,
yeah,

522
00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:10.060
we traded him away,
but don't get too excited Laker fans.

523
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:13.180
Cause I got a feel in those fucking,
the thunder are going to take you out.

524
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.770
You know,
I think you guys a ride.
Thank you.
You've,
if you had your moment,

525
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.910
you had your moment,
the fucking Sun.
But don't worry.
Don't worry.

526
00:32:21.911 --> 00:32:26.440
I heard through the fucking grapevine that a dad,
what's his face there?

527
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.610
The God damn.
He looks like one of those transformers.

528
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.750
Who's a guy applying?
I'm so bad when I want to talk about who.

529
00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:38.500
What the fuck is the Dwight Howard I heard through the grapevine wants to be a

530
00:32:38.501 --> 00:32:42.320
fucking Laker.
Can you believe that shit?
Can you believe that shit?

531
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:47.321
You know Ken Coby have any more championships just laid at his fucking feet.

532
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.650
Overrated.
Koby Bryant,

533
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:54.260
three out of his five fucking rigs.

534
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:59.910
Fucking nail.
Those stupid Laker fans.
Yad Vp,

535
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.550
SVP.
Anytime he does anything,
just drives me up the fucking wall.

536
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.450
The guy got shack in his prime with Phil Jackson,

537
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:14.360
you know,
and all these morons Laker fans will be like,
well,
Jordan had him.

538
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:19.220
Jordan had him when he was a fucking nobody with no experience.

539
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.390
Okay.
Other than as a player,
okay.

540
00:33:23.391 --> 00:33:27.410
He became Phil Jackson with,
with,
with the bowls.

541
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.860
You know what I mean?
You fucking morons.
He knew how to win.

542
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.160
He knew how to take big stars in molding together.
That's what the fuck he got.

543
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.690
And that's what he got with shack.

544
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.650
And then he's still pulled the fucking team apart.
Still pull them apart.

545
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.300
I don't know if he gets fucking Dwight Howard.

546
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.860
Fuck him and his in the last two championships I respected.
All right,

547
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:48.860
but those first three,
give me a fucking break.
Okay.

548
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.520
You Take Colby out of that lineup and you put me in there and that little

549
00:33:52.521 --> 00:33:55.910
fucking frilly gold and purple uniform with my ghost white legs.

550
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.650
We're still going to win 50 games.

551
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.320
I'm just going to be feed and check and he's going to turn around with this

552
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.750
tongue sticking out the side of his mouth,

553
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:10.040
like some special needs kid trying to put blocks in a round circle.
Right.

554
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.390
Ah,
really.
Did you have to attack those people bill?
Sorry,

555
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.690
I'm going off the dome.
Um,
anyways,
let's get back to fucking pot here.
All right.

556
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:24.980
This,
this is,
this is the conversation I had.
Oh,
I know.
So,
um,
I,

557
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.600
I went to this,

558
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.600
this Boston sports bar last night and for the first time since I could fucking

559
00:34:32.121 --> 00:34:36.340
remember,
I had a good experience as a fan because,
uh,

560
00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:38.300
and I mean almost you guys who listen to this,
you know,

561
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:43.040
even in the over there in jolly old England,
you're cozy,
smug cunts,

562
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.180
right?
If you're a fan of Liverpool,
you pretty much live in Liverpool,
right?

563
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:48.710
Isn't that how it for at least when you're young,

564
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.660
but then you move away and not only do you feel weird route and on your team

565
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:58.310
that get people are telling you that they suck at it.
It's unreal.
Since 1995,

566
00:34:58.311 --> 00:35:02.330
I moved to New York City and then it went from everybody loving the red sox to

567
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:04.100
absolutely hating their existence.

568
00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:07.220
And then I moved out to la and everybody hates the Celtics.
And,
um,

569
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.540
not to mention the awful vibe of sports fans out here and,

570
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.470
uh,
on the west coast,
they are fucking horrific.

571
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:23.330
I don't know why ESPN spins the lion's share of their time when they talk about

572
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:27.170
awful fans just talking about Philly,
you know,

573
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.980
just recycling those same two fucking stories about Santa Claus and a,

574
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:37.770
I don't know where else they did.
They fucking,
what did they do?

575
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.980
And they rape like Kathie Lee Gifford sent.
What happened?

576
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:45.180
I can't fucking remember it anyways.
Um,
yeah,
just out here.
The vibe,

577
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.860
it's just not fun out here.
Um,
I dunno,
I,

578
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.150
I can't explain it.

579
00:35:51.151 --> 00:35:56.151
It's like back east of noxious shit-talking morons.

580
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.430
Right.
And I include myself as one of those,

581
00:35:59.431 --> 00:36:04.200
but eventually it dies down and you'll start talking about the game.

582
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.090
You'll start talking about games you went to,
you start talking sports.

583
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.590
It goes beyond Eh,
fuck you.
You fucking chowder Eaton fig.

584
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:18.120
It goes beyond that out here.
It never does.
And when it does,

585
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.810
it goes on to a,
I'll stab you in the parking lot.

586
00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:30.570
It's not fun out here.
I just,
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.

587
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:31.081
There's that.

588
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:34.950
I will stab you in the fucking people get stabbed at Games out here.

589
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:39.120
It's hilarious.
Like that movie the warriors,
it's fucking ridiculous.

590
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:43.980
You Ucla and USC played at the Rose Bowl.
Okay.

591
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.810
And people got stabbed.

592
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:48.723
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

593
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.540
<v 7>And that talking about Philly cause they through batteries,
it's Santa Claus.</v>

594
00:36:52.541 --> 00:36:56.950
What would you rather have?
Would you rather be dressed like a holiday icon?

595
00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.950
Taken a fucking Duracell do the head or do you,

596
00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:04.630
would you rather take a steak knife to the gut through your game worn Jersey out

597
00:37:04.631 --> 00:37:09.631
in the parking lot to bleed out on the fucking 17th hole outside of the Rose

598
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:14.500
Bowl?
I don't fucking know.
So anyways,
can I,
can I,
so I,

599
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.560
I,
what am I,
I don't know what I'm saying to you.
You know,
you're stuttering.

600
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:22.410
Prick.
Um,
so I went to this,
went to this sports bar,

601
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.850
there was just a Boston sports bar and it was fucking great.

602
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.930
Like the Celtics did something good and I was almost self conscious to chair.

603
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:34.860
I'm so beaten down by living out here and everybody was going nuts and it was

604
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:37.800
just such a fucking relief and it was awesome.

605
00:37:37.801 --> 00:37:40.050
And I have decided fuck staple center,

606
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.740
I'm not going to the games down there.
Um,

607
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.460
even Dodgers games are surprisingly not fun.

608
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.910
I had a buddy of mine showed up to a Dodgers game.

609
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:54.330
They were playing some other national league team and he's from Cleveland.

610
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:55.920
He had a Cleveland Indians hat on.

611
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.550
He's out in the bleachers in this guy started like legitimately saying,

612
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:02.310
I'm going to kick the shit out of you if you don't take that Cleveland Indians

613
00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:06.150
hat off fucking Indians.
They haven't won since 1948 who gives a fuck?

614
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:11.610
So anyways,
I have,
fuck,
I'm never going to get back to the wheat here.

615
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.850
I'm going to have to stick with this fucking story.
So last week is you,
you know,

616
00:38:14.851 --> 00:38:18.800
I cut the podcast short cause I,
someone hooked me up and I went to the,
uh,

617
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.780
to the all star game to go down there and watch some of the greatest athletes on

618
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:26.620
the planet and of course check out the who was,
um,

619
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.810
and I was not disappointed.

620
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:33.180
I'm fucking amazing basketball.
Um,

621
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:37.090
and the level of whore,
I just,
every fucking tear.

622
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.160
Okay.
The desperate horror,

623
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:43.180
the horror lived down the fucking street all the way up to the whore who flew in

624
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:44.200
for the fucking game,

625
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.490
who's been doing [inaudible] for the last fucking eight months,
you know,

626
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.780
did some sort of cleanse and was just an unbelievable shape.

627
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.780
Just fucking trying to figure out how to get in to an after party to get into

628
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:02.800
the hotel.
And it was fucking awesome.
So anyways,
I get,
I get this insane hookup,

629
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.060
right?
I'm not trying to big league you guys here.
All right.
But I got it.

630
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:10.990
I got a great,
I got a great fucking hookup and I was in one of those,
uh,

631
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.370
one of the luxury box.

632
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:15.670
It's one of the 90 million luxury boxes that they have at staples center.

633
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.300
They have like three,
three levels of them.
Um,

634
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.020
and I'm sitting there and I'm like,
oh,
finally I'm in staples center.

635
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.200
It's not a Lakers game.
It's not a clippers game.
Then I played the Celtics.

636
00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:30.250
I don't have to listen to Boston sucks the entire time I'm here.
Right.

637
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.770
And all of a sudden,
hang on a second.
Is that my phone?

638
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.873
Can you hear that?

639
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:39.090
<v 8>Where the fuck is my phone?</v>

640
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.120
<v 7>He,
that gay little ring.
That's my phone.</v>

641
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.383
<v 8>Where is it?</v>

642
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.760
<v 7>Bomba [inaudible] Bomba bomb.
Anybody else had the fucking droid?</v>

643
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.370
Yeah,
that Don [inaudible].
The reason why I picked that is because I,

644
00:39:55.371 --> 00:40:00.371
there's like 10 options for a ringtone on the droid and the first nine sound

645
00:40:00.591 --> 00:40:03.990
like an air raid.
You now bap bap,

646
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.550
bap or they detected this ringing that just,
it just puts me on edge.

647
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.320
So the only thing like that one's called waterfall,
I think it is.

648
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.130
So I have it set on that and every time I do need it goes,
what are you afraid?

649
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.490
But I say like,
I liked that one.
So anyways,

650
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:24.810
so I got box seats for the fucking all star game.
It's ridiculous,
right?
Um,

651
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.110
and I'm sitting there and I got a holy,

652
00:40:27.111 --> 00:40:30.410
now I bought like an all star tee shirt and you know,

653
00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:34.010
total fucking nerd fan.
And I go to the game,
I'm thinking this is great.

654
00:40:34.011 --> 00:40:36.170
So finally have to deal with Shit talker people,
right?

655
00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.850
I'm sitting there watching the game and all of a sudden this little kid voice,

656
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.980
seven,
eight year old,

657
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.250
when when doc rivers put out the big three from the Celtics,

658
00:40:46.251 --> 00:40:50.850
I just start hearing this kid going anytime a Celtic shoot the ball,
he'd go bri

659
00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.970
yelling this shit right the entire fucking time I go,
you gotta be shitting me.

660
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.700
You gotta be shitting me.
Really?

661
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.090
You're going to heckle at a fucking all star game.
You idiot.
Right?

662
00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.880
And then they go to sit the big three from uh,
the Celtics,
right?

663
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:18.400
And then I heard this guy's voice go,
go soup bull stood.

664
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.760
I'm like,
what kind of a fucking moron yells at and an all star game.

665
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:27.080
And I look over,
I'm not going to say who it was,

666
00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.140
but uh,
it was a rapper,

667
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:36.220
very famous rapper who has being just a rapper,

668
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.150
you know,
has traveled the fucking world.
And I'm literally sitting there going,

669
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.400
cause I was looking at the kid going,

670
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:48.401
this kid sounds like a 35 year old asshole,

671
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.270
you know,
who calls in like a sports talk radio kind of thing.

672
00:41:53.271 --> 00:41:58.130
Why is he behaving that way?
And then I look,
oh cause his dad is an asshole.

673
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.030
It would have just said,
just kind of in an ended up,
you know,

674
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.780
the experience end up stuff.
But I will give this to them.
At least they weren't,

675
00:42:04.781 --> 00:42:09.080
they were making some noise.
I don't know if you guys watch the all star game.

676
00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:10.760
It was the worst crowd I've ever seen in my life.

677
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.240
The problem was because the entire lower level was either former players,

678
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:19.190
whores or some form of celebrity or somebody managing a celebrity.
And uh,

679
00:42:19.191 --> 00:42:21.850
everybody just sat there.
I mean,

680
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.700
I could have yelled from where I was sitting and someone on the court could have

681
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:29.420
fucking heard me.
But um,
I dunno,

682
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.590
I still liked that rappers albums,
at least the stuff from the late eighties,

683
00:42:33.591 --> 00:42:36.820
early nineties.
You're eventually going to figure this out.
But uh,

684
00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:39.410
uh,
Jesus Christ,

685
00:42:39.411 --> 00:42:43.490
do you ever have the urge to throw an eight year old off of fucking mezzanine

686
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:46.840
level?
I didn't want to do that,
but you know,
he's just like,

687
00:42:46.841 --> 00:42:50.510
will you shut the fuck up?
Just shut up.
All of Ya.

688
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:55.310
Ali is shut up and he can make a fucking lay up to shut up already.

689
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:58.730
It's a fucking all star game.
So anyways,
let's get back to the weed.

690
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.100
Let's get back to the weed.
So,

691
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.760
so I go to the sports bar and I'm hanging out and we started talking about,

692
00:43:04.761 --> 00:43:08.210
you know,
I'm still not Busan,
right?
135 fucking days here.
People,

693
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.510
this is getting serious.
You know,
this is like,
I,

694
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.460
I sort of hung out with somebody in a cult and you're like,
yeah,

695
00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.820
bills too smart for this shit.
You know.

696
00:43:16.821 --> 00:43:19.580
And then one day I show up with the shaved head and that glassed over,

697
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:22.280
look at my eye,
talking about waiting for the space ship.

698
00:43:22.281 --> 00:43:26.660
I'm 135 fucking days in people.
I don't know if I'm coming back.
Oh,

699
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:30.890
you fucking booze hounds out there.
I think you might've lost me.

700
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:36.450
The urge is still there.
Oh God,
I'd love to tear down a fucking fierce did.
Um,

701
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.700
so anyways,
so we were talking about the difference between,
you know,

702
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:45.690
booze versus weed and,
um,
and I,

703
00:43:45.691 --> 00:43:48.140
I basically told him,
I said,
yeah,
and I don't think there's anything,

704
00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.980
especially now it's like a vaporizer.
Um,
I don't,
you know,

705
00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.540
that has to be way more healthier than drinking like three beers.

706
00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.350
And that's seriously,
that's another thing too.
Like when,
when potheads go like,

707
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:04.430
you know,
you come home after work,
you have a beer,
I smoke a joint.
It's like,

708
00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:08.180
no dude,
that there's different,
I drink a beer,
I'm not drunk.

709
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:13.280
You know,
you smoke a joint that's like drinking.
Like what three,
four beers,

710
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.950
I think it is.
Anyways,
whatever.
So this,
this is what I think the differences are.

711
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.520
I think the fact,
because weed is not legal,

712
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.590
that's why it leads to other drugs.
You basically,

713
00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:28.970
you left the legal world and now you've dipped your toe into illegal.

714
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.060
And I think it's really easy to go from weed to be like,
Eh,
Gosh,
roams,

715
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.040
you know,
it's his cousin.
It's no biggie.

716
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.440
I have you,
you know,
and then there's there's,

717
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:44.370
and then cocaine is kind of further in the back of that room.

718
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:50.100
And then right behind cocaine is a big steel fucking door.

719
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.830
Like that maniac used to come out of in the,

720
00:44:52.831 --> 00:44:55.800
in the Texas chainsaw massacre,

721
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.810
you slide that fucker open and in there that's where it,
heroin,

722
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.690
meth,
oxy and all that shit is in there.
All right.

723
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.250
Which I don't think just because you smoke weed that you go to that,

724
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:11.010
but they're there.
That's what I will say.

725
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

726
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.920
<v 7>That Lena,
when when people who smoke weed go,
dude,</v>

727
00:45:14.921 --> 00:45:19.180
it doesn't lead the harder drugs and yeah,
it does.
I think it does.

728
00:45:19.181 --> 00:45:21.190
It doesn't always,
you know,

729
00:45:21.191 --> 00:45:24.040
this people who have smoked crack and they don't become addicted,

730
00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:25.660
they thought I tried it once,
I was like whatever.

731
00:45:25.661 --> 00:45:27.100
And then other people lose their entire lives.

732
00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:31.060
There is exceptions to it being up,
up,
being honest with me.
Potheads all right.

733
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:36.220
Like I,
this one,
I want to know how many people out there have just tried just,

734
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:41.500
you know,
Ben drunk,
you know,
tried alcohol I guess is what I'm trying to say.

735
00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:46.120
Never tried weed but did try mushrooms.

736
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:49.780
Like I've done two drugs,
a alcohol and mushrooms,

737
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:53.130
you know,
alcohol and coke.
I like,

738
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:58.260
I bet you would be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't have weed in there.

739
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.660
It goes bear.
We'd shrooms or beer,
weed,
coke,

740
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.880
depending on what you want to feel.
Right.

741
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.670
Do you want to hallucinate or if you want to feel like Charlie Sheen?

742
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:11.793
<v 1>Huh?</v>

743
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.810
<v 7>How fucking amazing was that whole thing?
I loved all that.
You know,</v>

744
00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.330
like I'm on Twitter by the way.

745
00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:21.310
I finally gave in Joe Rogan's signed me up to drop a fucking name there.
Uh,

746
00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:25.700
I was doing his,
a awesome podcasts,
which you guys should all check out.
Um,

747
00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.630
I was doing his podcast and he was beside himself that I wasn't signed up to

748
00:46:29.631 --> 00:46:31.700
Twitter and I've been shitting all over Twitter,

749
00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.910
tweeting and all that type of thing saying I don't want to fucking do it.

750
00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:38.900
And I'm gradually becoming addicted to it.
And of course I don't have,

751
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.770
we'll have it up on the [inaudible] podcast.com where I'm,
where I'm located.

752
00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:44.870
I had been,
uh,
you know,

753
00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.400
I learned how to attach pictures and uh,
you know,

754
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.680
I feel like a little schoolgirl right now.
I'm all excited.

755
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.780
I'm cutting and pasting.
I'm typing,
socializing.
Um,

756
00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:01.060
AH,
fuck.
What the hell was I talking about that I feel okay.
Weed coke.
Uh,

757
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:05.600
Texas chainsaw massacre is,
Oh,
you can't bill.

758
00:47:05.601 --> 00:47:08.810
What is wrong with your brain?
My brain goes when it goes in a straight line.

759
00:47:08.811 --> 00:47:13.280
If I tried to go back,
I'm fucked.
The fuck was I talking about?

760
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:14.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

761
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.130
<v 7>Oh,
Charlie Sheen.
There we go.
Thank God Charlie Sheen.
Alright,</v>

762
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.070
I'm gonna have to start doing this thing live so I can start taking college just

763
00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:24.100
for that specific thing that when I lose my train of thought,

764
00:47:24.101 --> 00:47:25.960
they could just tell me what the fuck I was talking about.

765
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:29.020
Or I could get an assistant,
you know,
I could do something like that.

766
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.370
Charlie Sheen.

767
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:34.270
I was amazed at the amount of people that took what he was saying at face value.

768
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.050
Kathy Lee Grifford to bring her up again.
She was like,

769
00:47:38.051 --> 00:47:41.170
I thought his statements were selfish.
They were self centered.

770
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.630
It was like you don't think he was high.

771
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.890
I can't say was high cause that would be slander.
But what the fuck?

772
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.160
Why is my voice cracking?
I know cause I was yelling and that Sports Bra,

773
00:47:51.161 --> 00:47:55.170
what the fuck?
When it's time to change?
Um,

774
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.823
that guy,

775
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.510
he sounded like he sounded okay for the legal department,

776
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:06.190
not slaves,
a little cook.
He sounded like somebody high on cocaine,
you know?

777
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:06.401
Right.

778
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:09.640
When you're hitting that peak before the paranoia comes in from what I've heard,

779
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.060
not so you guys think that I'm out there doing coke.
I can't do it.

780
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:17.050
I'm too fucking paranoid as it is.
You know,
that I'm,

781
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:19.630
the shit right up the mountain would be,

782
00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:22.450
would be very short for me and then it would just go right down to,

783
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:25.000
I think everybody's watching me.
Uh,

784
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:29.320
I'm going to go hide in a fucking broom closet.
Um,
yeah,

785
00:48:29.321 --> 00:48:33.850
he just sounded like he was fucking high out of his mind and I was actually kind

786
00:48:33.851 --> 00:48:38.620
of annoyed by the guy who was interviewing him because I just felt like he was

787
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:41.530
sort of enabling them,
you know,

788
00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.490
and I keep kind of saw in that lease.
I'm totally judging this because who knows?

789
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.880
I don't know either one of those fucking guys,
but it was like,

790
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.340
you see how celebrities Odi because people are just so psyched to be fucking

791
00:48:54.341 --> 00:48:58.120
around them that they look the other way.
The guy at one point goes like,
uh,

792
00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.030
you know,
I saw you the other day.
You seem fine.
You know,

793
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:05.740
we were at your house in your media room watching apocalypse now a year.

794
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:06.850
You seem fine.

795
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:14.550
It's like you fucking star Fucker gimme a god that you're,

796
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:16.100
you're with Charlie Sheen.

797
00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:20.020
Watch an apocalypse now and his media Roman is fucking mansion.

798
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:24.370
There's no way you're going to criticize him in that moment.

799
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:28.540
That would be like me hanging out with Jimmy page watching the song remains the

800
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:31.570
same.
He's falling down drunk and he looks at me like,
Hey,

801
00:49:31.571 --> 00:49:35.380
might you think I got drink it from Jimmy?
You're fine.
Hey,

802
00:49:35.381 --> 00:49:39.070
can I play one of these?
Gets I can have the guitar,
dude,
you're awesome.

803
00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:44.010
Who the fuck?
I mean that there's no way you're going to criticize anybody.

804
00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:44.933
You know,

805
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:51.260
if I could go a fucking watch the godfather over Al Pachino his house.

806
00:49:52.801 --> 00:49:53.790
Well I guess that's,

807
00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:57.270
that's not the same because Charlie Sheen's not in apocalypse now.

808
00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:01.320
Whatever help you don't have any kids.
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

809
00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:06.150
I Dunno.
So whatever.
I felt bad for the guy.
I hope he,
uh,

810
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.360
you don't hope he turns his life around.
But I also felt that he,

811
00:50:09.361 --> 00:50:10.650
I thought he made some decent points.

812
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.600
There was a lot of points and that was just like,
hey,
you know,

813
00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:18.030
skis you sort of hands on.
I'm,
I'm lying.
He actually,

814
00:50:18.031 --> 00:50:20.940
I only listened to half that shit.
I'm all right.

815
00:50:20.941 --> 00:50:22.290
Before we get into the podcast here,

816
00:50:22.291 --> 00:50:26.830
can I tell you about the content at the bank that I ran into this week?
Oh,

817
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:27.860
can you hear it?
Can you hear it?

818
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.530
<v 2>What a fuck is my fucking phone?</v>

819
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:38.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

820
00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:39.510
<v 2>What the hell is it?
All right.</v>

821
00:50:39.511 --> 00:50:41.490
Do you guys really wanna listen to hunt for my fucking phone?

822
00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.270
The hunt for Red October.
Um,
all right.

823
00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.570
So I'm sitting outside my bank,
you know,

824
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.900
cause I worked hard all week and why would I want the money when I can just go

825
00:50:51.901 --> 00:50:55.740
and give it to the Steven motherfuckers?
Oh sure.
I can have it at home.

826
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.060
Right then I got to worry that people will figure out that I'm,

827
00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:02.010
I'm cashing my checks and I'm bringing them home.
And next thing you know,

828
00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:05.730
the outside of my apartment looks like the end scene at the end of fucking

829
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.990
Scarface,
right?
Bunch of sweaty,
long haired Psychos,

830
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:11.483
you know,

831
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:17.110
climbing over my nonexistent walls and behind all of them.

832
00:51:17.111 --> 00:51:21.670
Some guy who's watched walking as slow as Jason and Friday the 13th knowing that

833
00:51:21.671 --> 00:51:23.290
he's going to get the fucking kill shot.

834
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:27.490
<v 7>Um,
so anyways,
I'm sitting outside the bank and I'm on a conference call,</v>

835
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:31.240
you know,
talking about some bullshit,
you know,
pitching some fucking idea,

836
00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.590
you know,
hey,
you know,
we'll take 10 whores,

837
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.600
we'll stick them in a house and we'll call it the fucking whore challenge.

838
00:51:38.741 --> 00:51:42.160
And if fucking we'll get fucking Bob Saget the host or whatever the fuck I was

839
00:51:42.161 --> 00:51:42.994
saying.
Right.
Yeah.

840
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.280
So as I'm sitting there outside the bank in the parking lot in my car,

841
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:51.330
uh,

842
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:56.330
this home and this lady pulls up and this Mercedes right and I'm on the phone,

843
00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:02.040
she opens the door right into my fucking car.
Boom.

844
00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:06.810
Does it look at my car,
closes her car door and just walks into the fucking bag.

845
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.320
And I was sitting there like beside myself going,

846
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:13.050
did she just open the car door into my fucking car?

847
00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:18.000
Cause she sewed a mind fuck me.
Cause I heard it,
but she didn't do a Oh or,

848
00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:21.480
oh my God,
I'm sorry she didn't look,
she just act like it didn't even happen.

849
00:52:21.481 --> 00:52:23.770
I was like,
you know,

850
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:27.720
you know the hybrid because it goes from like the gas engine to the electric

851
00:52:27.721 --> 00:52:30.150
engine sometimes when it,
when it turns over,

852
00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.430
it causes the car to shake a little bit.

853
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:35.130
And sometimes like when I'm one of my podcasts at time when I thought that guy

854
00:52:35.131 --> 00:52:38.670
rear ended me,
that's what happened.
So I was like,

855
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.590
this is that some sort of hybrid shit or whatever.

856
00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:42.840
So I go back to the phone conversation here.

857
00:52:42.841 --> 00:52:44.910
She comes out again and now you know,
I'm looking at him,
you know,

858
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.860
she's got little midriff showing,
you know,

859
00:52:46.861 --> 00:52:49.890
a little blondie and I'm like already starting to judge her and she comes

860
00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:53.010
walking again,
opens the car door right into my car.

861
00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:56.790
So I'm on this conference call with like fucking industry people.
I'd go,
Hey,

862
00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:01.040
can you guys hang on a second,
I should have hit mute.
And I didn't write.

863
00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.620
So I put,
I beeped the horn and I go,
I go,
hey,
hey.

864
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:09.450
I put the window down.
She's like,
what?
I go,
you just opened your door to my car.

865
00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:13.130
I did.
Yes,
you did it on the way into the bank.

866
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.430
And on the way out she was like,
well,
I didn't chip the paint.

867
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:20.640
That's what she said.
And I was like,

868
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.250
what do you mean he did shift a payee or you didn't even look,

869
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:27.600
how would you know why you be a little more considerate next time and look what

870
00:53:27.601 --> 00:53:31.940
the hell you doing?
Boom.
And I slammed the door shut,
right.

871
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:34.590
So I go back to the car,
go,
sorry about that.

872
00:53:34.591 --> 00:53:38.790
Guys are like [inaudible] [inaudible] built.
No,
it isn't.
All right.

873
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.720
You heard what happened?
You fucking jerk.
You don't have any,
you know,

874
00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.573
you don't have it.

875
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:49.250
<v 9>Confrontations.
Right.
So she goes,</v>

876
00:53:49.251 --> 00:53:53.400
uh,
then I just hear her with my window up.
I can just hurt her going right.

877
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:58.740
<v 7>Have a nice day.
My,
she starts doing that shit.</v>

878
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:03.780
Like I'm this asshole like me getting upset that you opened your fucking car

879
00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:07.290
door to we twice without a care in the world.

880
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:11.910
Like my natural reaction is not supposed to get upset.
You know what I mean?

881
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:17.850
I Dunno.
You know,
I don't believe in that whole heaven and Hell Shit.

882
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:21.320
But I think that that episode right there is,
you know,

883
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:23.670
if there is this whole judgement that was one in favor of me,

884
00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:27.540
the fact that I didn't call her a cunt,
you know right there.

885
00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:30.510
You know what I mean?
She ends up giving me the finger,

886
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.270
like somehow she's been wrong.
I swear to God,
dude,

887
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:37.590
I just wanted to take my fucking passenger side door,

888
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.300
open it up and fucking wait like three fucking times.
Right.

889
00:54:41.301 --> 00:54:44.970
And do a God damn car.
And they'd just go,
hey,
did chip the pate?

890
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:51.150
This is why I didn't.
Two reasons.
One,
because it was a broad,

891
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:53.460
all right.
It was a guy.

892
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:56.130
I wouldn't do it because what if he comes over and beats the shit out of me?

893
00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:01.020
Who's hey and hope.
Okay.
You know,
if you want to have like a,
a street fight,

894
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:05.830
like a brother on brother fight,
where we both end giving each other in,
you know,

895
00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:10.530
in simultaneous headlocks going,
you give,
you give,
I'll have a fight like that,

896
00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:13.620
but I,
you know,
average random dude,
I'm not fighting the guy.

897
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:16.500
I'm 42 fucking years old.
Okay,
I'm gonna get my ass kicked.

898
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.100
But now there was a woman,
I can't do it because

899
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.150
<v 9>she could get out of her fucking car.
It just starts smashing up my car.</v>

900
00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:30.160
And there's really nothing I can do to try and physically stopper because she's

901
00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:34.030
a lady.
Right.
And that's the first reason.

902
00:55:34.031 --> 00:55:39.031
And then the second reason is I've watched enough sports to realize that,

903
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:44.590
uh,
the refs always see the retaliation.
They never see the initial thing.

904
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:47.800
So it's like she fucking hits me twice.
Nobody sees it.

905
00:55:47.801 --> 00:55:50.710
And then I fucking slam Mike and then I,
you know,

906
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:56.110
<v 7>she did it to me first and I would fucking loose.</v>

907
00:55:56.590 --> 00:56:00.050
So I didn't do anything.
Uh,
uh,
uh,

908
00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:04.720
the fucking thoughts I had afterward of wishing I followed her,

909
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:10.300
you know,
in my quiet hybrid to wherever the hell she lived.

910
00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.430
And I,
we wanted to carve into her driver's side door,
either cunt.

911
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:20.770
And I was like,
yeah,
that's fine.
That's an original.
I,
I,
I wanted to carve in,

912
00:56:20.771 --> 00:56:25.210
I didn't ship the paint and to the,
or maybe I did ship the paint,

913
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:29.140
lol,
laughing my ass off.
Omg.
Or just some dumb shit.

914
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:33.910
You know what if I,
you know,
what kills me is she's out there.

915
00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:37.810
You know,
she probably told the story later on that day where I would just,

916
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.000
I would love to hear her version of that fucking story,
uh,

917
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.450
how she was the victim.
You know,
it's just,

918
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.250
I can't tell if it's because she was hot and she's not used to somebody actually

919
00:56:51.251 --> 00:56:55.090
calling her on her shit or if she's a product of the combination,

920
00:56:55.091 --> 00:57:00.091
the timeout generation and that generation for the last fucking 35,

921
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.470
I don't know,
35 years for the last,
I don't know,
25 fucking years.
The parenting,

922
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.560
at least in this country,
I don't know what happened.

923
00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:13.590
It's like it went from when I was a kid where whatever your neighbor said you

924
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:17.260
did,
your parents believed whatever he had.

925
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:19.330
Teachers said you did your parent,

926
00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:22.100
whatever it adults said that you were doing and you were out of a,

927
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:26.230
and you will add a line.
Parents just said,
oh,
is that what he's doing?

928
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:31.060
I'm going to have a talk with them.
Mr. Robinson down the street says,

929
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:32.610
<v 3>yeah,</v>

930
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.580
<v 7>you've jumped over his fetch.
You will,
you weren't,</v>

931
00:57:34.581 --> 00:57:39.581
you were jumping in his pool and then you tried the latter top gimme that shit

932
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:48.190
get upstairs.
You go on your fucking and whatever.
They don't do that anymore.

933
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:51.980
The last like 25 years.
It's like if,
uh,
if uh,

934
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:54.670
somebody says something to somebody,
hey,

935
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:57.670
basically your kids being a fuck head right now,

936
00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:02.890
they just automatically defend that kid straight through the whole thing.

937
00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:06.500
They defend their kid.
You can't go to somebodies house.

938
00:58:06.501 --> 00:58:09.850
She can have a fucking play date.
You don't get the shit kicked out of you.

939
00:58:09.851 --> 00:58:13.480
You don't get hit or anything.
You get a timeout,
you know,

940
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.950
and then I think,
you know,

941
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:20.490
25 fucking years later you were in a bank fucking opening you goddamn door into

942
00:58:20.491 --> 00:58:23.570
somebody's car.
You're a surprise that they're mad and beat.

943
00:58:23.571 --> 00:58:25.350
Don't think you did anything fucking wrong.

944
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.420
Timeout.
Look at hockey.
You go and they beat the shit out of somebody.

945
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:36.260
They just make the guys sit down for five minutes,
you know?

946
00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.440
Does he learn anything?
Like he comes out,
he fucking beats him up again.

947
00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:47.060
Hey,
by the way,
I bought those broads,
Huh?
Beaten a very,
very,
very,

948
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:51.260
very strong Vancouver conduct team as a big fucking victory for us.

949
00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:54.440
But I think before and,
Oh,
and the fucking road trip dude.
All right,

950
00:58:54.441 --> 00:58:59.240
let's get to the topics for this week.
Uh,
topic number one for the classic,

951
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:03.410
is it racist,
racist,
racist,
racist.
Um,

952
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.850
oh,
the floor.
I get it.
Get it

953
00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:07.000
<v 2>to that.
Before I get into that,
um,</v>

954
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.240
here's something you might want to read up on last week when I was talking about

955
00:59:10.241 --> 00:59:15.160
the,
uh,
the,
the horrors that go to the all star game and that type of shit.

956
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:19.680
Um,
there's,
somebody sent me an article that we will have linked on the uh,

957
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:22.070
the m m podcast.com,
uh,
was

958
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:27.070
<v 9>an article that came out in 2006 in Gq magazine where one of the writers hung</v>

959
00:59:27.921 --> 00:59:31.730
out with some groupies,
some NBA groupies and that type of thing.
And,
um,

960
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.811
what is really,

961
00:59:32.811 --> 00:59:36.110
it's a really interesting article and what is also really interesting is she

962
00:59:36.111 --> 00:59:41.111
never really gets to talk to any of the whores that are really doing the dirt.

963
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:46.010
You know what I mean?
She talks to three girls who,
well,
we might if it happened,

964
00:59:46.011 --> 00:59:50.330
but who knows.
We're just here to have fun.
That's how tight that circle is.

965
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:52.970
It's really interesting article while have the link up on the MLM,

966
00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:57.860
podcast.com the official pant fan page of the Monday morning podcast.

967
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:01.050
And now let's get to the topic.
Is it right date,
right?
Hey Man.
Hey Man,

968
01:00:01.051 --> 01:00:02.690
I think I'm all right bill.

969
01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:05.780
While flipping the channels the other night I happened to catch the end of

970
01:00:05.781 --> 01:00:10.660
America's funniest home videos.
Um,
America's funniest home videos.

971
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:14.330
The family that one on this particular night was a white family with what I

972
01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:18.860
assumed was an adopted black daughter,
uh,
who was maybe six or seven years old.

973
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:21.230
Anyways,
after they announced the winners,

974
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:24.530
the host shook each of the family member's hands.

975
01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:29.180
But when he got to the little girl,
he put his hand up and ask for a high five,

976
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.770
which immediately made me livid.

977
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:37.250
I'm not saying it was necessarily racist,

978
01:00:37.251 --> 01:00:42.200
but I hate it when white people call me brother or want to give me complicated

979
01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:44.030
handshakes when they barely know me.

980
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:48.920
Can you please tell your listeners to knock that shit off?
Lol.
Um,

981
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.660
you know,
it's fucking funny about that is,
yeah,
I agree with you.
It isn't racist,

982
01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.210
but it is a,
uh,

983
01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:01.750
in knowing sort of a pandering or ingratiating yourself to black culture.

984
01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:08.180
Yeah,
I can,
I,
I know what you're saying.
I just don't know how to verbalize it.

985
01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:12.050
The only way I can really describe it is you guys,

986
01:01:12.051 --> 01:01:15.140
anybody out there by that P90x I recommend it.
It's great.

987
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:17.960
I just go on the road so I can't do the Diet.
So it didn't work for me,

988
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:22.040
but knee has been doing it lately and she brought up something,
I forgot.

989
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:25.520
What's really funny on those tapes.
I,
I don't,

990
01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:28.940
I can't remember the names of the people there,
but there's like,
you know,

991
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:33.200
a white guy like two white chicks and then a black dude.

992
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:37.370
So he goes around the room saying hello to everybody.
This is Pam.

993
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:40.130
They call their blam.
Right.
And he just,
you know,
going to,

994
01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:43.900
this is Jerry's a taekwondo guy,
watch out for this guy.
You know,

995
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.620
this is so and so blah,
blah blah.

996
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.680
And then he walks up to the black guy and let's just say his name is like,

997
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:51.830
you know,
whatever James.
And he goes and they'd be like,
what's up James?

998
01:01:51.831 --> 01:01:52.664
My brother,

999
01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.340
every fucking disc.

1000
01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:02.640
He calls him my brother and then he goes like high pitch my brother.

1001
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.340
And it's,
it's so a Douche chills from the opiate death,

1002
01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:10.220
I think believe opion Anthony came up with that expression or that's at least

1003
01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:14.350
what I heard at first dose chills every time I hear that.
Um,

1004
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.870
I had totally agree with you.
I don't think it's racist.
It's just some sort of,

1005
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:21.760
it's like if you met Asian,
what's your bow?
You know,

1006
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.930
ads.
Yeah,
I get that.
I get that.
That's fucking funny.
Um,

1007
01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:28.530
<v 1>okay.</v>

1008
01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:32.940
<v 9>I,
and I've been guilty of doing a semi,
you know,
the,
the,
the,</v>

1009
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:34.410
the handshake,
the uh,

1010
01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:35.920
<v 1>okay.</v>

1011
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.870
<v 9>I don't know.
The mainstream one
was,</v>

1012
01:02:39.871 --> 01:02:42.540
it grabbed the thumb slide of the hand,
the snap thing.

1013
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:45.420
That thing was there for a while and I don't even fucking know,

1014
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:49.560
but I will not do a fist bump with anybody,
even if,
uh,

1015
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:52.020
even if there's a black guy there,
I still won't do it.

1016
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:55.260
I'll just assume that he's still hanging out with too many white people and

1017
01:02:55.261 --> 01:02:59.970
that's why he's still doing,
uh,
a pound.
Um,
all right,
next one.

1018
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.260
Um,
hey bill,

1019
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.640
I just finished up a conversation on Facebook with some female friends of mine.

1020
01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:10.080
Um,
long story short,
I asked if they were on Twitter.
They replied,

1021
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:12.300
we don't Twitter.
And I replied,
all right,

1022
01:03:12.301 --> 01:03:16.170
well whenever you ladies realize that you're missing out on the greatest social

1023
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:19.020
network since the underground railroad,

1024
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:23.190
just follow me at any wrote his Twitter name.
He say,
what was my comment?

1025
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:27.150
Racist in your opinion?
Um,
no.
First of all,
you guys,

1026
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:30.900
you got to let me know what race you are too.
So I'm assuming that you're white.

1027
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:32.610
No,
that isn't racist.

1028
01:03:32.611 --> 01:03:37.200
That's what overly sensitive people would think that it's racist because you

1029
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:42.230
made a reference to something that involved a,

1030
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.030
they do.
They do.

1031
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:49.860
This happens to me a lot in standup where people don't look at the context in

1032
01:03:49.861 --> 01:03:51.930
which you're saying something.

1033
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:57.390
You're basically saying the underground railroad is the greatest social network,

1034
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.450
or Twitter is the greatest one since the underground railroad.

1035
01:04:00.451 --> 01:04:03.780
So doesn't that mean that you think that the underground railroad was a great

1036
01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:06.510
thing?
The underground railroad was,

1037
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.280
was Africans escaping slavery?
So no,

1038
01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.400
I think it's actually,
it's a good reference.

1039
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.890
I think you're guilty of making a good reference.

1040
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.010
But if you are around a bunch of overly sensitive people,

1041
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:23.490
they would immediately think because you brought up something that had to do

1042
01:04:23.491 --> 01:04:28.080
with slavery on some level,
that you somehow advocating advocated slavery.

1043
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:29.370
Um,

1044
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:33.540
that happens a lot in stand up where people don't listen to what you're saying.

1045
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:38.730
Or if you make a reference to slavery,
they then think that,
well,

1046
01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:43.490
because you made a reference to it,
then you obviously advocate it.
Um,
um,

1047
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.390
so no,
I don't think that that is a,
uh,
I don't think that that's racist.

1048
01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:52.350
All right,
let's plow ahead.
Next one is it right?
Here's a bill.

1049
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:53.820
Here's one for you.
I'm 35,

1050
01:04:53.821 --> 01:04:58.440
but when I was about 23 for some reason I went to a bunch of stores looking for

1051
01:04:58.441 --> 01:05:02.490
a specific CD CDs back when they had those things.
Um,

1052
01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:06.000
so I come from a middle class family.
You went to high school,
high school,

1053
01:05:06.001 --> 01:05:09.030
that was like nine.
Oh two one.
Oh,
it was almost entirely white.

1054
01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:13.980
So I find myself in this store looking for what I thought was a CD by Snoop
Dogg.

1055
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.110
I felt like an idiot.

1056
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.140
And I'm standing there and Khakis and a polo while a,

1057
01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:24.640
the other white kid behind the counter reads a list of available CD titles by

1058
01:05:24.641 --> 01:05:29.320
Snoop Dogg.
Um,
as I try to remember the name that I'm looking for.

1059
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:31.840
All right.
It didn't really set that up.
So he goes into the story,

1060
01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:33.610
he finds another white kid who works there.

1061
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.720
He's dressed in Khakis and polos and says that he's looking for a snoop Dogg CD.

1062
01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:42.400
So now the white kid behind the counter is reading off titles of Snoop Dogg

1063
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:44.230
albums.
He goes,
try to imagine him,

1064
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:48.940
the white kid looking down at the computer screen and him reading the title.

1065
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:54.160
He goes,
snoop upside.
And then looking at me straight in the eyes,

1066
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:58.570
finishing sarcastically with your head.
Snoop upside your head,

1067
01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:01.990
I guess was the name of the album.
I,
he goes,
I never felt so white,
lol,

1068
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:07.210
discouraged.
I leave for another store across the street in the mall.

1069
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.071
As I walk in,

1070
01:06:09.071 --> 01:06:12.400
I immediately spot one of the token black kids that I graduated with me.

1071
01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:15.700
I'm now right there.
That that's an offensive,

1072
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.310
that's offensive to a lot of people.
Token black kids,
you know,

1073
01:06:18.311 --> 01:06:20.410
that's when you go to the all white school.

1074
01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:24.490
And then there was like one black kid.
The kid's always called the token.

1075
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:29.380
So that's offensive all the way to racist,
depending on how I would think.

1076
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:33.820
Um,
but whenever,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,
so anyways,
he sees,
you know,

1077
01:06:33.821 --> 01:06:36.640
the one black kid,
he basically went to high school with how he said,
I was like,

1078
01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:41.410
thank God lol.
I stop him and say,
Antwan,
listen man,

1079
01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:43.270
listen man.
He throws in a man.

1080
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.570
I have a question for you.
What is the name of that snoop Dogg CD with the Blah,

1081
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:53.890
blah,
blah song on it.
Of course there was the awkward,
what do you ask him?

1082
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.770
You ask me because I'm black,
right?
Is the question he asked.

1083
01:06:56.771 --> 01:07:00.790
And as I'm standing there stumped for a response,
he said,
it's not stupid.

1084
01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:05.230
It's not snoop Dogg,
it's Dr Dre and the CD is the chronic.

1085
01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:08.590
Uh,
he said,
now feeling like a true idiot.

1086
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:12.880
I tried to make some ridiculous small talk.
That's fucking hilarious.

1087
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:16.960
Uh,
I knew I went to the right source as he confirmed.
What,

1088
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:21.670
what are your thoughts?
Is that racist now?
Now it's not racist.

1089
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:23.230
The token black guy thing.

1090
01:07:23.231 --> 01:07:25.560
I thought of everything you said was the thing that I would,

1091
01:07:25.561 --> 01:07:29.020
would raise the red flag where I would,
if I was in a conversation with you.

1092
01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.530
You know that shit where one white guys talking to another white guy,

1093
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:36.250
he doesn't know they're not a nowhere or something sort of in the gray area

1094
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.560
comes into the conversation and you know,

1095
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.240
then there's always that tense moment of like,

1096
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:44.560
is this going to take a fucking right turn down to an unpaved road

1097
01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.630
down to a shack?
Um,
no,
it isn't.

1098
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:54.210
It's not racist at all.
And it was proven because he knew the fucking answer yet.

1099
01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:58.420
Maybe you're guilty of racially profiling.
I think you,
you went really efficient.

1100
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.900
It's not like you didn't try to ask another white kid.

1101
01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:04.030
He had no idea and he was a cunt.

1102
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.610
He almost seemed like he was judging you because you were,
uh,
you,
you,

1103
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.730
you were buying the music or in generally just didn't like rap music.

1104
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:14.560
But you saw the black dude you went to school with.

1105
01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:18.560
That's fucking what he asked me because I'm black.
You should have said yes.

1106
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.500
What am I supposed to ask some redneck?
Well,

1107
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:24.280
what would happen if I walked up to you when it has?
Hey,
what?
What's,

1108
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:28.250
what's the name of that new Travis trade album?
He probably be like,

1109
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:31.610
what the fuck are you asking a black guy that question for,
you know,

1110
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:35.270
if somebody came up to me and said,
hey bill,
what's the name of that beer?

1111
01:08:35.271 --> 01:08:38.430
That Dev that's famous that Ireland bakes,
I wouldn't get offense.

1112
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:40.520
I wouldn't get offended by that.
You know?

1113
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:45.020
Or if they assumed that I drank because I'm Irish,
even though mostly German.

1114
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:47.420
All right.
But I bought it because I have,

1115
01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:51.080
I don't get offended when people assume that I'm mostly Irish.
I mean,

1116
01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:54.200
it's not like I don't look like a fucking Leprechaun.
Um,

1117
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.430
I think that that falls into being overly sensitive,

1118
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.870
but I feel that guy's entitled to considered considering he seemed like he was

1119
01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:07.160
the only black guy.
His school and other white kids referred to him as the token.

1120
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.130
And despite all that,
he was still nice enough to tell you what CD to buy.

1121
01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:17.600
See that?
That had a nice warm,
fuzzy ending.
All right,
another one,

1122
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.150
dear bill.
Hey,
by the way,
my breathing's getting a lot better.

1123
01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:23.590
I got to prep pat myself on the back.
The Pat Pat myself on the back.

1124
01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:27.770
My speaking still sucks.
Oh,
Gigi,
dear bill,

1125
01:09:27.771 --> 01:09:31.460
I recently moved to downtown Denver from Fort Collins.
Oh Jesus.

1126
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:36.080
Is that up near Greeley,
Colorado where they have the bad smell day.

1127
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.210
I know I've talked about this before on the podcast,

1128
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:42.050
but just in case there's new listeners out there in Greeley,
Colorado,

1129
01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:46.370
they have a slaughter house up there where a,
you know,

1130
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.550
if you ever wondered where you fucking hamburgers and steaks and all that shit

1131
01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:54.340
came from Greeley,
Colorado is a good guests and uh,

1132
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.640
some days when it's really windy up there and they've murdered a bunch of

1133
01:09:58.641 --> 01:10:03.590
fucking steer a,
they have what's known as bad smell days.

1134
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:08.600
And what you do is you call up the slaughterhouse and you say,

1135
01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:12.770
Hey Kenya,
can you fucking cool it a little bit up there?

1136
01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:18.170
We can smell it all the way down here.
You can smell the murder,
this fight.

1137
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:21.320
And then they actually sort of a,
I don't know what they do,

1138
01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:26.240
take a 15 minute break from killing the stairs or whatever.
I don't fucking know.

1139
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:31.070
A steer by the way,
is a bull without balls.
I had no idea what that was.

1140
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.220
I knew what a cow was.
I knew what a bull was.
I didn't know what to steer.

1141
01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:39.221
Was steers a bull without balls and those are the things that they uh,

1142
01:10:39.681 --> 01:10:42.080
they use for all your steak and hamburger,
I believe.

1143
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.750
I don't think they use the cows.
The cows for the milk.

1144
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.670
They use the bulls to fuck the cows,

1145
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:50.720
to make more cows and and make a more bowls and then they cut their balls off

1146
01:10:50.721 --> 01:10:53.510
and they make them stairs.
Is that how it works?
Right.

1147
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:58.850
Then I learned that in my travels out there on the road,
correct me if I'm wrong.

1148
01:10:58.851 --> 01:11:03.350
They are southerners.
What are you asking me?
Because I'm from the south.
Yes.

1149
01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:08.000
You pig fucking jackass answered the question.
All right,
here we go.
Dear Bill,

1150
01:11:08.001 --> 01:11:12.260
I recently moved to downtown Denver from a,
from a,
from Fort Collins,

1151
01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.070
a small college
town north of Denver.

1152
01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:18.700
The only black people I had a had been used to seeing.

1153
01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.690
We're either exchange students from Africa or Colorado State football,

1154
01:11:22.691 --> 01:11:23.680
basketball players.

1155
01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.370
My new home in Denver is a neighborhood that is known for having a high black

1156
01:11:27.371 --> 01:11:28.204
population.

1157
01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:32.260
To cut to the point I've noticed while driving around my place that black
people,

1158
01:11:32.261 --> 01:11:36.310
generally younger black guys,
do not respect jaywalking laws at all.

1159
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.900
I noticed that this,

1160
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.340
I noticed this after the fifth time in one day that a black dude had walked

1161
01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:46.720
right out into traffic expecting that the drivers would hit their brakes and

1162
01:11:46.721 --> 01:11:50.590
wait for him to cross the street.
Now I see now I see this happen every day.

1163
01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:51.543
When I got home,

1164
01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.730
I brought it to the tension of my roommates and girlfriend and they thought I

1165
01:11:54.731 --> 01:11:56.260
was crazy.
But soon enough,

1166
01:11:56.261 --> 01:12:00.280
they all began to notice this phenomenon and now it's a big inside joke amongst

1167
01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:04.420
us.
Uh,
also,
I don't know if you've seen that.

1168
01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:07.960
There are quite a few popular youtube videos that show exactly what I'm talking

1169
01:12:07.961 --> 01:12:08.231
about.

1170
01:12:08.231 --> 01:12:11.560
One video that I think you may have talked about showed a black guy dance his

1171
01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:14.230
way into traffic until an ice cream truck put a stop to that.

1172
01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.930
Is it racist that I noticed this also?

1173
01:12:16.931 --> 01:12:20.320
Is this just a Denver thing or does it happen elsewhere?
Uh,

1174
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:22.240
jaywalking happens.
Uh,

1175
01:12:22.241 --> 01:12:26.830
I think all over the world and every race does it as far as I know.
Um,

1176
01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.490
this one is a little complex because there's a lot of levels to this cause you

1177
01:12:30.491 --> 01:12:32.440
don't seem like you have hatred in your heart.

1178
01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:33.933
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1179
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.540
<v 9>And also I haven't been to your neighborhood.
If that's what people do,</v>

1180
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:39.893
<v 1>you know,</v>

1181
01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:45.280
<v 9>then that's what they do there.
I lived in New York City and we all do it all,</v>

1182
01:12:45.281 --> 01:12:49.360
everybody 80 year old fucking,
uh,

1183
01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:54.340
women from the aster family,
Jay walk when then you know,

1184
01:12:54.341 --> 01:12:59.080
over to their fucking town car to go visit their bars,
a gold,
um,

1185
01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:03.650
everybody jaywalks so I wouldn't,
I wouldn't,
yeah,

1186
01:13:03.651 --> 01:13:07.250
obviously it's black people aren't the only ones who jaywalk but a in your

1187
01:13:07.251 --> 01:13:09.050
neighborhood,
if that's what everybody does,

1188
01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.340
I mean that's not racist to notice that.
Uh,

1189
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:17.260
I think [inaudible] just say that it's just black people.
Um,
I don't,

1190
01:13:17.261 --> 01:13:19.120
I have,
you know what this is,
these,
these are getting,

1191
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:22.390
these are getting difficult cause I got to hear what you're doing with that

1192
01:13:22.391 --> 01:13:24.460
information.
You know,

1193
01:13:24.461 --> 01:13:27.220
you did have your little clan moment where you convinced the people that you're

1194
01:13:27.221 --> 01:13:29.200
living with.
I'm telling you,
go out there,

1195
01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:32.170
go out there and look at them and then they came back,

1196
01:13:32.171 --> 01:13:36.220
oh we shit your rack now how offensive it is at that.

1197
01:13:36.221 --> 01:13:39.520
Just because you know you're from Denver.
Why am I giving you a southern accent?

1198
01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:42.850
See,
we're all full of shit here.
Um,

1199
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.180
oh fuck.
I just had a point there.
What the hell was I going to try to make?
Yeah.

1200
01:13:48.181 --> 01:13:50.760
I mean I'd have to know if you would just say in like,
you know,

1201
01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.110
if you take it to the level I guess,
uh,

1202
01:13:56.210 --> 01:13:59.130
[inaudible] go and let you know,
I,
you know,

1203
01:13:59.131 --> 01:14:02.380
the obvious level to take this where it would obviously be racist if you would

1204
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:06.210
just like,
we gotta get,
we gotta get all the black people out of this country.

1205
01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:10.620
There are all these Jay walking such a bitches,
they're ruining this country.

1206
01:14:10.621 --> 01:14:14.230
Or Ah,
you know,
I don't want my daughter dating a black guy.
Why?

1207
01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:16.900
Cause they're Jaywalking,
sons of bitches,
of what?
I mean,

1208
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:19.630
I don't fucking know if you just sort of noticing this and you're,

1209
01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:24.631
and you think it's funny that they do this shit kind of like when I do that

1210
01:14:25.271 --> 01:14:26.140
older agent thing,

1211
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:30.340
I don't have anything to get agents or a old people if you fucking around like,

1212
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:32.950
no,
I mean it's probably offensive,
like my older Asian thing,

1213
01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:37.570
which I guess at that am I,
that game is offensive to some people.
Um,

1214
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:44.830
yeah.
Is it racist
that you noticed?
I mean,

1215
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:50.080
it did happen.
I guess it's when you start thinking that,
that uh,

1216
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:52.330
all black people in general,

1217
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:57.900
like Bill Cosby is walking out of his mansion and Jay walks across the street to

1218
01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:02.080
a,
I mean,
I dunno,
I dunno where to go with that one.
Yeah.
No,

1219
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:04.660
but I'll tell you this dude,

1220
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:09.250
everybody jaywalks and I am one of the major offenders of it.

1221
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.950
I do it all the fucking time.
All right.

1222
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.220
I don't have fucking time to walk down to the God damn corner.

1223
01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:18.490
I don't understand what the fucking point is.
I get it.

1224
01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.890
Look both ways and if there's nothing coming,
then go.
But if something's coming,

1225
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:28.160
don't go.
I get that.
All right,
Jay walking.
Uh,

1226
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:32.410
I think those laws are basically invented that basically,

1227
01:15:32.411 --> 01:15:36.630
so that a can keep traffic moving and be,
um,

1228
01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.790
don't have to clean up a lot of dead people in the street because there's a lot

1229
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:40.570
of bad drivers.

1230
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:43.960
And there's also a lot of people who can't see that well or cross the street

1231
01:15:43.961 --> 01:15:48.790
correctly.
Maybe that's why I don't fucking know.
All right,

1232
01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:49.930
now we're into advice.

1233
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:53.230
It's just one of these ones where I'm just reading too much rather than riffing.

1234
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:55.240
Is that,
what,
is that?
What the fuck's going on here?
You know what?

1235
01:15:55.241 --> 01:15:57.940
I'm going to talk about youtube videos.
Maybe they'll fucking stir up some soda,

1236
01:15:58.210 --> 01:16:02.040
some sort of comedy here.
I feel like I'm on fucking meet the press,
uh,

1237
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.570
youtube videos.
Um,
check this one.
I'm ever,

1238
01:16:04.571 --> 01:16:06.490
a few weeks ago when I showed that to Johnny Mack,

1239
01:16:06.491 --> 01:16:09.820
the QB doing all those trick shots,
uh,

1240
01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:11.500
somebody made an answer video,

1241
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:15.670
somebody else through his fucking football helmet into the ring.
Some guy,
Alex,

1242
01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:19.150
I don't know if I want to say this right.
Tanny.
Alex tanties video.

1243
01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.940
This is what I got to say about all these,
these trick shot QB things.

1244
01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:26.860
The ones that are most impressive is when they do more than one trick without an

1245
01:16:26.861 --> 01:16:30.130
edit.
Those are the ones that I like,
but uh,
you know,

1246
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.880
<v 3>okay.</v>

1247
01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:36.470
<v 9>Other than that,
these are pretty impressive.
So check that one out.
Um,
his,</v>

1248
01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:40.580
his is a classic Youtube video woman beats up boyfriend,
keeps yelling,

1249
01:16:40.581 --> 01:16:44.510
fight back.
All these videos will be up on the m podcasts and I,

1250
01:16:44.511 --> 01:16:48.320
this is some inside information then I'll give you,
I never named names,

1251
01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.030
all right?

1252
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:54.560
But there's a friend of mine who wrote a very successful movie after watching

1253
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:57.140
this video.
All right?

1254
01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.560
And in this video there is a woman beating the shit out of a guy.

1255
01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:08.090
A big woman.
Okay.
So think of some comedies that came out

1256
01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.270
and the last little shit.
What was it?
I think it was like five years ago.

1257
01:17:13.271 --> 01:17:14.110
It came out

1258
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.670
<v 1>and</v>

1259
01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:19.370
<v 9>damn,
why don't I just tell you the movies?
Norbit</v>

1260
01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:20.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

1261
01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:24.040
<v 9>The guy know who wrote the movie,
wrote the movie.
After seeing this video,</v>

1262
01:17:24.041 --> 01:17:26.830
he thought this video was fucking hilarious.
And said,
that's a movie.

1263
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:29.890
And then he wrote it and then again made,
and I remember standing there going,

1264
01:17:29.891 --> 01:17:33.790
wow,
it's that fucking easy.
You just have to sit down and do the God damn work,

1265
01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:38.800
you know?
Uh,
all right,
next one.
Magnetic kid.

1266
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:40.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1267
01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.060
<v 9>What the fuck is that?
Did I even watched that one?</v>

1268
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:43.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1269
01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.390
<v 9>Seven year old kid claims he's magnetic.</v>

1270
01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:49.170
I somehow missed that one drunk guy on the news.

1271
01:17:49.171 --> 01:17:52.080
You have to see this is the best one of the week,

1272
01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:53.790
I think as far as fucking hilarity.

1273
01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:58.620
This guy is out of his mind and speaking of racist is by,
this guy gets real.

1274
01:17:58.621 --> 01:18:02.740
He's really drunk.
And he starts talking about his neighbors.
He goes,
now,
Sally,

1275
01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.260
you just,
why are you right now?
I never liked those people.

1276
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.430
Uh,
I'm,
I'm gonna stay.

1277
01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:14.490
I'm going to say something racist.
Right?

1278
01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:20.310
And he's so drunk.
He never gets around to it.
But the,

1279
01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.790
one of the funniest things in this video,

1280
01:18:21.791 --> 01:18:25.560
aside from the unbelievably long pauses this guy takes between talking,

1281
01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:30.750
is how the,
the reporter keeps trying to give the guy the out.
He's like,

1282
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:34.860
did you start drinking because you was so distraught from the fire?

1283
01:18:34.890 --> 01:18:39.280
And the guy's like,
no,
you know,
like I've been dragging off.

1284
01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.080
I was drinking before the fire,
during it and after it,
you know,

1285
01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:46.400
that's just basically his whole vibe.
Then here's a video people keep sending me.

1286
01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:48.570
I don't know why people find this thing funny.

1287
01:18:48.571 --> 01:18:51.630
I find the voiceover to be unbelievably annoying.

1288
01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:56.810
It says crazy nasty as honeybadger and I guess it's making fun of all the videos

1289
01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:58.950
showing how bad ass the honey badger is.

1290
01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:03.900
But this guy sounds like he's doing a really bad impression of a sitcom

1291
01:19:03.901 --> 01:19:06.600
character that's gay.
And uh,
he just,

1292
01:19:06.601 --> 01:19:10.380
he's annoying after a while a conspiracy theorists out there,

1293
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:14.430
new world order documentary we have.
And um,

1294
01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.290
I actually got this one Chevy 1991 s 10 commercial.

1295
01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:22.260
Uh,
the,
one of the people I follow on Youtube,

1296
01:19:22.650 --> 01:19:27.650
he does a bunch of a really good Zeppelin covers and he throws up random videos

1297
01:19:27.841 --> 01:19:29.580
every once in a while.
So I saw it on his channel.

1298
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:32.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1299
01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.330
<v 9>It was both for Shard,
I believe his name is bea a.</v>

1300
01:19:35.331 --> 01:19:40.170
You just type in that and then look up Zeplin if you're a drummer.
Um,

1301
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:44.930
he fucking kills a bunch of different Zeplin tracks and,
all right,

1302
01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:49.160
those are the youtube videos for this week.
And uh,

1303
01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:50.230
do I have anything else to talk about?

1304
01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:52.730
I think I was just going to fucking advice and then we'll wrap this God damn

1305
01:19:52.731 --> 01:19:56.990
thing up.
We will wrap it up.
Oh,
this week,
by the way,
I'm going to be in Miami.

1306
01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.180
All right.
I'm going to be in Miami
at the,
uh,

1307
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:06.980
the fucking fuck fest theater.
Why the hell am I going to be,
hang on a second.

1308
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:10.500
Let me,
let me get the information for Ya.
Right?
You just sit tight.
You sit tight.

1309
01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.290
You're God damn cubicle.
Alright.

1310
01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.730
Start fucking scratching your Chin as you're looking at those spreadsheets like

1311
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.100
that's odd.
All right.

1312
01:20:20.101 --> 01:20:24.840
I'm at the new world symphony 517th Street,
Miami Beach,
Florida.

1313
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:28.040
Also for those of you in Utah,
I added,

1314
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:33.090
I added a date in March,
March 18th and March 19th.

1315
01:20:33.091 --> 01:20:37.250
I'm going to be at wise guys in West Valley City,
Utah.
Uh,

1316
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:40.080
probably going to hang around for another day to go fucking skiing.
Oh,

1317
01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:43.560
I know what I want to tell you guys.
I finally committed to the sport of hockey.

1318
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:46.620
Told you I've been playing ice hockey out here and all I had,

1319
01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:50.850
I had the helmet with the full cage in the front because who's kidding who my

1320
01:20:50.851 --> 01:20:55.750
dream of making it to the Nhl died sometime I believe.
Oh,

1321
01:20:55.751 --> 01:21:00.540
about 1984.
Um,
I was never good.
I always sucked.

1322
01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:03.960
So I would go,
I'd been playing I helmet,

1323
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:08.250
I have the full face mask and I had the gloves,
sticks,
skates.

1324
01:21:08.251 --> 01:21:12.780
Obviously that's all I had and I got to tell you as a 42 year old man falling

1325
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:15.450
down on the fucking ice,
that is not a good feeling.

1326
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:19.500
So I finally just said to hell with it and I went out and I bought all the gear,

1327
01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:23.850
head to toe.
I have all the fucking pads and it made a,

1328
01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.920
made all the difference in the world.
Dude,
you go down,
you don't feel anything,

1329
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:31.890
you don't feel anything.
It's fucking tremendous.

1330
01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:37.290
It's like falling a fallen on it.
Not Pillows,
but I,
it's,
it's the shit.

1331
01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.950
So,
uh,
so anyway,
so what I've been doing is,
you know,

1332
01:21:40.951 --> 01:21:42.150
I hate going to the fucking gym,

1333
01:21:42.151 --> 01:21:46.400
so I either take my dog for a hike or recently for cardios that they had,

1334
01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:47.800
you know,
they have the public skating thing,

1335
01:21:47.801 --> 01:21:52.110
so I'll go down there like a fucking pedophile,
you know,

1336
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:57.000
42 year old single white male,
never married,
no kids.

1337
01:21:57.210 --> 01:22:01.290
I swear to God,
I won't even look at a child when I am in there.
I won't,

1338
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:05.070
I fucking,
I just skate around and I fucking mind my own business.
So anyway,

1339
01:22:05.071 --> 01:22:07.320
I go down there and a,

1340
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:11.010
I basically work on shit that I suck at that you can work on it during a public

1341
01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:14.610
skating thing,
which is basically I suck at stop and on my right side.

1342
01:22:14.611 --> 01:22:18.810
So I just started working on that.
And A,
I can turn around to skate backwards,

1343
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:22.830
but I'm not good.
I'm more lefthanded than I am right handed,
so I'm not good yet.

1344
01:22:22.831 --> 01:22:24.030
I shoot the puck right handed,

1345
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:27.750
I'm fucked so I can't turn around to the right side.
Good.

1346
01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:30.660
So the only way you improve in life is if you attack your weaknesses.

1347
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.050
So I start learning it right?
And I'm crossing over and everything's going right.

1348
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.460
<v 2>Great.
And then what happens?
I get a little cocky.
Oh right.</v>

1349
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:42.420
And I'm fucking my version of flying.

1350
01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:45.990
I'm probably going three quarters of the speed that,
uh,

1351
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:48.960
that I can skate and I fucking turn around and dude,

1352
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:52.080
I don't know what the fuck happened cause I,
you know,
I'll fall,

1353
01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:55.050
but I can fall gracefully at this point.
If this was like,

1354
01:22:55.290 --> 01:23:00.290
I had a beginner fall and I was going backwards at about 17 miles an hour and I

1355
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:05.650
didn't fall on my side.
I didn't,
I didn't get my hands down.
Nothing.
I fell,

1356
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:10.300
I fell like a fucking tree and I landed right on my ass.

1357
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:13.000
And then I got my right elbow down at the last second.

1358
01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:16.390
So my head didn't hit the ice,
but my brain's still smacked.

1359
01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:20.440
And like I was dizzy when I got up at dude.
I swear to God,

1360
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:25.000
I don't know how I didn't break my tailbone.
I fucking like,

1361
01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:29.710
my ass was killing me.
I had to,
I,
I,
I,
I skated off the ice.
That was it.

1362
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:34.330
I was done,
like went off the ice and I sat down and I collected myself,

1363
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.750
you know,
and I had snow all over my backside.

1364
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.920
<v 7>Oh,
I missed the best part.</v>

1365
01:23:41.921 --> 01:23:46.921
And when I fell down and I fucking went to try and just kind of stayed there for

1366
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:50.200
half a second,
like,
did I just break my fucking tail bone?

1367
01:23:50.201 --> 01:23:53.620
Did I really just do that?
And I,
and I didn't feel any sort of,
you know,

1368
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:58.480
pain beyond,
I just busted my ass on the ice.
So as I roll over some,

1369
01:23:58.481 --> 01:24:03.340
like 11 year old kid skates by and does this Simpson,
ha ha.

1370
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:06.610
And then keeps going.
I got to admit,
I didn't get even get mad at him.

1371
01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:09.610
I was just like I said,
I know it,
I know and I know it.

1372
01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:14.530
And then I got up and it wasn't till I was driving home that that kid actually

1373
01:24:14.531 --> 01:24:17.860
annoyed me and I dreamed of cross checking him into the glass,
you know,
which is,

1374
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:20.150
which is childish.
But uh,
yeah.

1375
01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:25.030
So I'm playing again this week and I'm definitely having a good time.

1376
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.040
It's so much better than going to the gym and I'm,

1377
01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:32.470
I having fallen on the ice there by myself.

1378
01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.290
I have a whole new respect for like contact sports.

1379
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:37.000
They like people who play him at like,
you know,

1380
01:24:37.001 --> 01:24:40.990
professional fucking levels or even just pick up games like,
uh,

1381
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:45.910
you know,
I was seriously like,
there was like,
I had to collect myself.

1382
01:24:45.911 --> 01:24:50.200
Like I said,
like,
I can't imagine doing that shit for a fucking living.

1383
01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:52.420
Mean skating is hard enough.

1384
01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:55.570
Forget about some guy trying to knock you over when you're not looking.

1385
01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:59.950
It's just,
it's unbelievable.
It's unfucking believable,
so it's unbelievable.

1386
01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:03.670
I couldn't believe it.
I'm bored with it already.
Um,
all right,
let's,

1387
01:25:03.671 --> 01:25:07.450
let's read some advice and then I'm getting the getting the fuck out of here.

1388
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:12.130
By the way,
recently I've actually thought,
I've considered about,
uh,

1389
01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:15.670
having some advertising here on the podcast and I know you guys are thinking,

1390
01:25:15.671 --> 01:25:19.870
Oh gee,
he is here.
He goes,
he's gonna sell out,
man.

1391
01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:24.520
I'm,
you're absolutely right.
I am going to sell out.
You know,

1392
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.910
what do you think of?
I want to keep it real and stay broke.

1393
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.490
I'm not broke.
I'm doing all right,
but give me a fucking break.
Okay.

1394
01:25:33.491 --> 01:25:36.940
Eventually people,
I'm not going to want to jump on a God damn airplane.
Okay.

1395
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:42.100
And I don't want to charge,
you can say anything,
you know,
so,
uh,

1396
01:25:42.101 --> 01:25:43.440
I've been thinking about it so,
but I,

1397
01:25:43.441 --> 01:25:46.390
I think I can still do it in a creative cool way where I'll just have

1398
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:51.310
advertisers on here of Shit that I like.
Drum companies,
booze,

1399
01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.200
uh,
you know,
Shit like that.
As long as I can read it and make fun of the copy,

1400
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:57.710
I will do it.
Um,

1401
01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.010
and I'll charge everybody a dollar 75 for episode.
Um,
I,

1402
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.130
I'm going to try to figure something

1403
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.450
<v 9>out.
Um,
all right,
let's go to advice.
Spill advice.
Um,</v>

1404
01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.990
so for the last five years I've been teaching guitar lessons full time at a very

1405
01:26:11.991 --> 01:26:14.820
large music school in Chicago.
Um,

1406
01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.520
there are over a hundred music teachers at a school with about 5,000 students.

1407
01:26:19.521 --> 01:26:23.000
Every session,
half of those students are under 18.

1408
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:27.140
The school has been around for over 50 years and is globally recognized.

1409
01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:30.320
Let me see if I can figure that out.
I was Chicago.
I don't know that one.

1410
01:26:30.321 --> 01:26:31.190
I was gonna Guess Berkeley.

1411
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:35.300
Now I get an email from the new director of the school saying all of the staff

1412
01:26:35.301 --> 01:26:40.301
are required to get their thumbs scanned by some company called bio metric.

1413
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:43.063
What?

1414
01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:44.230
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1415
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:48.100
<v 9>Biometric Scans your thumbs into their watch system.</v>

1416
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:50.500
We all already had,

1417
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:52.120
<v 3>okay.</v>

1418
01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.540
<v 9>Ah,
background checks done when we were hired,</v>

1419
01:26:54.541 --> 01:26:56.760
but now they argue that we need to have this done.

1420
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.750
Apparently all of the public school teachers in their entire city are being

1421
01:27:00.751 --> 01:27:03.120
forced to do this as well.
Basically,

1422
01:27:03.121 --> 01:27:07.380
anyone who is around any younger who was around any younger,

1423
01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.340
please people please proofread your shit.
You make me sound dumb.

1424
01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:12.480
I'm already dumb enough.

1425
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:16.570
Basically anyone who was around any younger people,

1426
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:21.590
oh for a profession is now mandated by their employee to get in this creepy

1427
01:27:21.661 --> 01:27:23.190
biometric system.

1428
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:25.383
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1429
01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:28.360
<v 9>You see this shit.
If you guys noticed this,</v>

1430
01:27:28.361 --> 01:27:29.890
all this fucking screaming and yelling.

1431
01:27:29.891 --> 01:27:34.300
We do during every single election that comes around to pick the Democrat or the

1432
01:27:34.301 --> 01:27:35.320
other Republican.

1433
01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:38.500
It doesn't make a difference because when the real shit goes down,

1434
01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:43.480
like approving,
giving biometrics the right to do this,

1435
01:27:43.481 --> 01:27:46.210
we don't get to vote on this.
They don't even tell us about it.
So just go,

1436
01:27:46.211 --> 01:27:48.760
it's a law.
It's mandatory.
You have to do this.

1437
01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:50.580
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1438
01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.290
<v 9>He,
anyways,
he says,
I don't want anything to high,</v>

1439
01:27:52.291 --> 01:27:53.890
but the mental picture of all of us,

1440
01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:57.040
harmless musicians lining up like fucking cattle,

1441
01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.240
having some storm trooper assholes scanning my thumbprint into some super

1442
01:28:01.241 --> 01:28:04.690
computer where it will stay forever is really depressing.

1443
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:08.980
Obviously this is all done in the name of air quote,
protecting the children,

1444
01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:11.650
but at what cost?
Here's my question for you.

1445
01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.470
I feel like this is my moment to take a stand.

1446
01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.400
Should I make a deal big deal about this and try to rally all the other teachers

1447
01:28:18.401 --> 01:28:22.960
to fight this or will I just look like I have something to hide?
Uh,
it is really,

1448
01:28:22.961 --> 01:28:26.620
really hard to get a job at this school,
so I'm scared to make waves.

1449
01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:30.130
Do you feel like this protects kids from creeps?

1450
01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:34.990
I should mention then the schools,
50 year,
his history,
no incident of a teacher.

1451
01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.720
A student misconduct has been recorded.

1452
01:28:37.721 --> 01:28:41.920
Everyone knows that pedophiles can't play an instrument.
Lol.
Uh,

1453
01:28:41.921 --> 01:28:46.000
and do you think,
um,
they are making priests get thumb scans?

1454
01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:51.040
I fucking bet.
Not all joking aside,
I'm really bothered by this situation.

1455
01:28:51.041 --> 01:28:52.840
What should I do,
Bill?
I don't know why.

1456
01:28:52.841 --> 01:28:55.180
The first thing I would do is I would talk to other teachers

1457
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:59.700
and see how they feel about it.
I think that's complete horseshit dude.

1458
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:05.950
They have been basically working their way towards this since they first came up

1459
01:29:05.951 --> 01:29:10.300
with photo ids and social security numbers and all of that shit.

1460
01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:14.710
It's all done under the whole guise of organization in your own fucking safe.

1461
01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:18.130
And it's complete horse shit.

1462
01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.360
It has to do with them eventually trying to have a very few people be able to

1463
01:29:26.531 --> 01:29:31.450
make the decisions for all of us.
That's basically what's going on.

1464
01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:34.240
Okay.
And the more information they have about you,

1465
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:37.870
the easier it is to be able to find you.
I mean,
think about that shit.

1466
01:29:37.871 --> 01:29:38.980
They're going to have your thumbprint.

1467
01:29:38.981 --> 01:29:42.250
They know what you're fucking fingerprint looks like.
All right.

1468
01:29:42.730 --> 01:29:46.720
They're going to have an a visibility to freeze your fucking bank account and

1469
01:29:46.721 --> 01:29:51.220
your cell phone as a goddamn microchip in it.
Okay,
so the second day,

1470
01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:56.340
I mean this is like end of day shit and they got these fucking robots that

1471
01:29:57.821 --> 01:30:01.630
they've been working on that can outperform human beings up telling you our days

1472
01:30:01.631 --> 01:30:03.430
are fucking number.
They out on jeopardy.

1473
01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:07.540
The other day they had two human beings playing against a fucking computer.

1474
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:12.380
Those two people,
they're helping.

1475
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:13.740
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1476
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.750
<v 9>Human beings get phased out.
You should see,</v>

1477
01:30:15.751 --> 01:30:19.150
I'm not sure heating gets a fucking computer so you can figure out how it does

1478
01:30:19.151 --> 01:30:22.960
against me and you can figure the computer's weaknesses and strong points so it

1479
01:30:22.961 --> 01:30:26.650
can come back with even more game and you can pump it back with more fucking

1480
01:30:26.651 --> 01:30:27.191
information.

1481
01:30:27.191 --> 01:30:31.570
So eventually I become fucking useless unless of course I know how to build a

1482
01:30:31.571 --> 01:30:36.400
robot or know how to grease it's fucking joints.
Yeah,
Dude.
I think,
yeah,

1483
01:30:36.401 --> 01:30:41.200
I think it would be a very noble thing if you complained about that.

1484
01:30:41.201 --> 01:30:44.140
I think people need to complain more.
I'm guilty of it.

1485
01:30:44.141 --> 01:30:47.380
I fucking rant here on this podcast,
but I've never been to a protest,

1486
01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.670
but I don't think that it's right that they,
that they pass a lot.

1487
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:52.060
Like whether you agree with that or not,

1488
01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.600
that's not something that they should be able to pass without the voice of the

1489
01:30:55.601 --> 01:30:57.970
people.
We should be able to vote on something like that.

1490
01:30:57.971 --> 01:30:59.200
That's fucking ridiculous.

1491
01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:02.260
I just find out from my account the other day after years of saying,

1492
01:31:02.261 --> 01:31:06.100
I'm not doing my shit online because I don't want to put all that information

1493
01:31:06.101 --> 01:31:09.820
online.
I now have no option.
I have to do it online.

1494
01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:15.370
You know,
I,
I don't want to put all my fucking information online,

1495
01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:20.800
my tax ID numbers,
my social security numbers.
You're out of your fucking mind.

1496
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:25.090
You're letting people in to your entire financial history.

1497
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:29.050
You'll let me g g your whole fucking God knows what they can do with that and

1498
01:31:29.051 --> 01:31:32.940
they can ruin you.
All right.
I'll,
I'm doing is bitch in here,
but I don't know,

1499
01:31:32.941 --> 01:31:35.600
that shit really stretched fucking creepy as hell.
Um,

1500
01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:37.770
I would talk to other people and be like,
dude,
hey,
you know what,

1501
01:31:37.771 --> 01:31:38.730
what do you think about this?
You know,

1502
01:31:38.731 --> 01:31:42.550
sort of get it going know just like how they started the revolution in this

1503
01:31:42.551 --> 01:31:45.340
country.
Hey Yo,
you think about those red coats,

1504
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:50.110
they kind of a ditch,
right?
To kind of dicks.
Yeah.
I don't like him either.

1505
01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.380
All right,
a question.
Hey bill,

1506
01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:55.470
this has been bothering me for a while now and I'm not sure what to do.

1507
01:31:55.470 --> 01:32:00.250
I'm 19 years old.
I go to Umass Amherst,
O g G.
Um,

1508
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.820
dude,
that place is insane.
Do you guys still party the timeout generation?

1509
01:32:03.821 --> 01:32:06.190
Do you still party the way they used to where they would actually have

1510
01:32:06.191 --> 01:32:09.940
fatalities at that school?
People used to ride the elevators.

1511
01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.390
There was that classic urban myth about those kids bring in the cow up to the

1512
01:32:13.391 --> 01:32:15.490
roof of the building and they didn't know how to get it off.

1513
01:32:15.491 --> 01:32:20.410
So they just pushed it off the side and it exploded into a hamburger heaven.

1514
01:32:21.150 --> 01:32:24.640
Um,
anyways,
I had a girlfriend my first semester of college,
uh,

1515
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:28.050
that was still in high school.
We both knew that I was going to do it.

1516
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.310
We both knew that I was going far away and we,

1517
01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.620
but we agreed that we would stay together.
However,

1518
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:36.010
I guess her feelings changed and she wanted to be single.

1519
01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.970
I was devastated when she broke up with me and I've been really down because she

1520
01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:44.290
was the first girlfriend I had that I really liked.
And,
uh,

1521
01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.960
I wasn't just trying to get laid.
I actually liked this girl.

1522
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:50.590
So after a few weeks I found out she was hooking up with this kid that I

1523
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:53.950
considered to be a friend,
a boy,

1524
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:57.370
because we had been hanging out over the summer and partying together.

1525
01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:01.600
What's fucked up about the whole situation is that this isn't the first time

1526
01:33:01.601 --> 01:33:05.230
this guy has done this to me.
All right.

1527
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:08.860
You know what I just thought of when I read that sentence was,
uh,

1528
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.330
what was the force,
the name of that movie?
Uh,
dead presidents.
You don't,

1529
01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:17.050
when the dude comes back into the pool hall with the stick and he beats the shit

1530
01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:20.770
out of Terrence Howard,
I that's,
I'm not saying to do that,

1531
01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.030
but that's the first movie scene that came to my head.
Anyways,

1532
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:26.410
at the end of my senior year,

1533
01:33:26.411 --> 01:33:28.900
I broke up with a different girl and this kid was hooking up with her.

1534
01:33:28.901 --> 01:33:32.860
About a month later,
I let that one slide.
That's your fault then if,

1535
01:33:32.861 --> 01:33:34.420
because he said,
because again,

1536
01:33:34.421 --> 01:33:38.200
I didn't really give a fuck about any other girlfriends I had before this

1537
01:33:38.201 --> 01:33:40.570
previous one.
Um,

1538
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.260
I don't want to be a crazy ex boyfriend that gets defensive over girls that no

1539
01:33:44.261 --> 01:33:45.094
longer liked him,

1540
01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:48.820
but should I or should I not tell this kid to back off and stop going after my

1541
01:33:48.821 --> 01:33:52.360
ex girlfriends?
Uh,
you definitely need to have a talk with that dude.

1542
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1543
01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:57.540
<v 9>You need to clear the air with him and um,</v>

1544
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.670
and then you need to stop fucking with them.
That's what I would do.

1545
01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:06.090
And I would go somewhere along the lines of describing him as like a,

1546
01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:09.870
you ever see those little fish that swim under the big fish,
you know,

1547
01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:12.510
and I plankton,
I don't know what they fuck they are,

1548
01:34:12.511 --> 01:34:16.080
they swim over under the whales.
You know,
just ask them.
It's like,
dude,

1549
01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:19.870
you have an ability to get pussy without drafting behind me.

1550
01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:22.240
Like somebody in the Tour de France,
you know,

1551
01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:25.000
if there was like pussy at the finish line of the fuck is wrong with you,

1552
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:27.760
you know,
I don't know.

1553
01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:31.690
Don't listen to me on how to say that stuff because I say fuck a lot and I'm an

1554
01:34:31.691 --> 01:34:34.120
angry dude.
You'll end up getting into a fist fight.
But uh,
yeah,

1555
01:34:34.121 --> 01:34:37.700
I would definitely say something to the kid.
Oh,
you don't,

1556
01:34:37.701 --> 01:34:40.200
it'd be funny if you call them up.
Like,
I don't know where you're from.
You know,

1557
01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:41.520
just say you're from,
um,

1558
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:44.140
<v 1>okay.</v>

1559
01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:47.650
<v 9>Just say you're from La.
Just call them.
Say,
Hey,
listen,
just to let you know,</v>

1560
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:51.490
I've been recently hooking up with this chick from San Diego.
Uh,
you know,

1561
01:34:51.491 --> 01:34:53.110
just want to let you know,
you know,

1562
01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:55.660
send you a picture just to show you the next person that you're going to be

1563
01:34:55.661 --> 01:34:59.120
fucking cause evidently you loved sloppy seconds.
You know,

1564
01:34:59.121 --> 01:35:01.670
you fucking pervert you gave from me or something.

1565
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:05.960
Do you just want to be where my Dick has been?
You know the love of God.

1566
01:35:05.961 --> 01:35:09.080
Go get yourself a boyfriend.
There you go.
Hit Him with the homophobia.

1567
01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:12.620
That's a good one.
Not that I advocate homophobia,
but when you use it,

1568
01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:16.280
it can be your friend,
uh,
that,
that he makes sense.
All right bill.
Hey Bill.

1569
01:35:16.281 --> 01:35:19.820
I'm 24 and have four kids.
Jesus Christ.

1570
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.670
What does it the fucking 18 hundreds.
What do,
what do you got?
What?

1571
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:26.840
You got some fucking,
do you need some farmhand,
sir?

1572
01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.810
Somebody go clean out the silo or fill it up.

1573
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:35.450
Oh good Lord.
You guys make your own clothes.

1574
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:40.850
I'm 24 and I have four kids.
I'm married.
I feel bad for this guy.

1575
01:35:40.851 --> 01:35:41.684
Should make fun of them.

1576
01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:46.580
I worked for public utilities doing very hard manual labor and I worked hard for

1577
01:35:46.581 --> 01:35:49.550
my money,
which goes straight to my wife and four kids.

1578
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:54.790
Basically when politicians run for office and they try to stand on the shoulders

1579
01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:57.950
of hardworking Americans.
This is the guy right here.

1580
01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:02.570
This is the guy that like Sam Elliott talks about it.
Speaking of that,

1581
01:36:02.571 --> 01:36:05.030
I recently saw one of those cores commercials.
Have you seen that?

1582
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:11.050
<v 8>The rocky mountains go down this country like a backbone and we make a beer the</v>

1583
01:36:12.261 --> 01:36:16.390
way the fuck we want to and natural tab and a backbone is all about you're going

1584
01:36:16.391 --> 01:36:20.400
to have a backbone to make a light beer that looks at and stay slide piece,

1585
01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:25.940
a watered down shitty beer comes from the backbone.
Rocky mountains.

1586
01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:30.470
<v 9>You know something?
I think whenever you have a pussy product,</v>

1587
01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:34.430
you know one of the red flags is he gets Sam Elliot to do the voiceover.

1588
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:36.380
You know,
cause you're like,
oh my God,

1589
01:36:36.381 --> 01:36:40.610
people are going to see right to the fact that wait,
come on people cores.

1590
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.100
It's one of those beers when like you're hung over that you actually drink.

1591
01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:48.020
That's like vitamin water for an alcoholic.

1592
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:56.750
They're trying to tie it into the fucking rocky mountains.
I mean,
I know,
I know.

1593
01:36:56.751 --> 01:37:00.980
They,
they get their fucking water from the rocky mountains.

1594
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.040
<v 8>Let's go down this country like a back</v>

1595
01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:07.550
her tough dash.
She had,

1596
01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.610
give me somebody at school bandage core lad.
Okay.

1597
01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.580
<v 9>Yeah.
Jesus.
Anyways,
where the fuck am I?</v>

1598
01:37:15.581 --> 01:37:17.080
How the fuck that even start talking about that.

1599
01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:21.040
The other day I got a call from work,
uh,
the other day I got a call from her.

1600
01:37:21.041 --> 01:37:23.710
Okay,
let,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's reset this up again.

1601
01:37:23.711 --> 01:37:27.190
The Guy was 24 years old.
He has 17 kids now.
He has four kids.
He's married,

1602
01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.830
works with public utilities,
does very hard manual labor.

1603
01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.160
He works his fucking ass off and all his money goes straight to his fucking wife

1604
01:37:33.161 --> 01:37:34.510
and his kids.
All right.

1605
01:37:34.511 --> 01:37:37.510
The other day I got a call from her at work and she told me to meet her at the

1606
01:37:37.511 --> 01:37:41.050
doctor's office because she doesn't like taking the kids to the doctor alone.

1607
01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:46.360
When I get there,
she starts yelling at me as usual red flag and they,

1608
01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:50.500
and then said,
then she said,
all you know how to do his work,

1609
01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.920
so why don't you just go back to work and saying all I do is pick

1610
01:37:56.220 --> 01:38:01.140
<v 7>up after you and the kids and basically calling me a loser for working and</v>

1611
01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:06.120
making money.
I'm doing my best to provide for my kids.
She takes my money.

1612
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:09.270
She spends my money on stupid shit.

1613
01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:14.070
We've been married for a year and four months now,
but you get four kids.

1614
01:38:14.071 --> 01:38:17.160
Did you have quadruplets,
sir?
What happened?
I don't know bill.

1615
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:20.730
I just like to hear your take on the situation and give me some advice.

1616
01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.550
All right.
Oh,
okay.
No gauges.
Here we go.
All right.

1617
01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:27.950
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:32.250
<v 7>All right.
First things first.
I don't know what you said before.</v>

1619
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:35.790
She said all you know how to do his work,
so why don't you go back to work?

1620
01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:41.510
That could have been anything from her actually being a jerk to her saying,

1621
01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:46.020
yeah,
Philip has a cold and you said,
yeah,
which one's Philip?

1622
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:49.090
We've got so many fucking kids.
Which one?
Which one is he?

1623
01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:52.360
Is he the little rusty here at one?
Then she,

1624
01:38:54.370 --> 01:38:55.280
<v 10>did you go back to work?</v>

1625
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.890
<v 7>You know,
if she said it like that,
then what can you do?
Um,</v>

1626
01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:02.490
but it doesn't seem,
I don't know.

1627
01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:06.270
The fact that she's saying all I do is pick up after you and the kids,

1628
01:39:06.930 --> 01:39:07.763
uh,

1629
01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:09.560
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1630
01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.750
<v 7>This,
this is what you need to do.
The worst thing that you can do,
um,</v>

1631
01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:18.880
when you want somebody to hear your point is to be a fucking asshole like me.

1632
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:20.000
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1633
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.910
<v 7>It's like when I,
when I approached that lady at the bank,</v>

1634
01:39:23.630 --> 01:39:24.070
<v 3>okay.</v>

1635
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:28.870
<v 7>You know,
I,
she didn't hear what I was saying because age,</v>

1636
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:32.270
she's,
you know,
she's a cunt.
All right?
Who's kid who,

1637
01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:35.980
but beyond that was,
I was a dick to her.

1638
01:39:35.981 --> 01:39:37.960
So no one's going to listen to you if you're a dick.
So if you really,

1639
01:39:37.961 --> 01:39:40.300
if you want to stay with this woman,
right?

1640
01:39:41.290 --> 01:39:43.240
You're going through a rough period in your relationship.

1641
01:39:43.241 --> 01:39:47.590
What you have to do is you've got to walk away from that situation,

1642
01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.590
you know,
go scream into a pillow,

1643
01:39:50.591 --> 01:39:53.570
all the shit that you want to say to her or go yell at your windshield.

1644
01:39:53.571 --> 01:39:57.220
Did you drive around the block 15 fucking times for a couple of drinks,

1645
01:39:57.221 --> 01:39:59.080
whatever you got to do,
unwind.

1646
01:40:00.150 --> 01:40:00.610
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1647
01:40:00.610 --> 01:40:05.610
<v 7>and this is how I do it cause I have a brutal temper and just write down on a</v>

1648
01:40:06.311 --> 01:40:10.720
piece of paper what you want to fucking convey.
All right?

1649
01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:14.530
And then practice it.
I know this sounds crazy to,

1650
01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:17.290
to people who don't have this problem,
but that's what I have to do because I,

1651
01:40:17.291 --> 01:40:20.710
I'll sit there and like that bank thing,
I,
I,

1652
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.950
I tried to practice it.
My first attempt to practicing,

1653
01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:28.090
I would start off slow and eventually get pissed all over again.

1654
01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:31.810
I'd be like,
hey listen,
I noticed that when you went in,
you know,

1655
01:40:31.811 --> 01:40:35.050
you open your car door into my car and then he came out and then you did it

1656
01:40:35.051 --> 01:40:37.410
again.
And it's like,
what the fuck?
You know?
Okay,
we didn't have to,

1657
01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:38.920
I can't do that.
All right.
Start over bill,

1658
01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:41.230
and each time I would get further and further to the end.

1659
01:40:41.890 --> 01:40:44.830
So that's what you have to do with this person.

1660
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:48.880
You have to sit down hour and 12 minutes.
How fucking long is this podcast?

1661
01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:51.730
You have to sit down with her and just be like,
look,

1662
01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.970
<v 9>I mean,
I don't know what you're just say,
listen,
we have four kids deaths.</v>

1663
01:40:57.971 --> 01:40:58.804
The situation,

1664
01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:03.980
you know the place is going to be a mess and I am working.
Okay.

1665
01:41:03.981 --> 01:41:07.820
Obviously I'm not giving you what you need.
What?
What more do you need from me?

1666
01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.050
Okay,
let her s that's it.
Probably a good way.

1667
01:41:13.710 --> 01:41:16.620
All right,
we need to talk.
You seem really upset with me.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1668
01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:20.850
blah.
What more do you need from me than what I'm doing?
All right.

1669
01:41:21.330 --> 01:41:22.650
Since she sees that you're relaxed,

1670
01:41:22.651 --> 01:41:24.210
you're going to hear what the hell she wants to say.

1671
01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:29.080
Then when she says what she has to say,
you know,
fair enough.
All right,

1672
01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.900
here's,
here's,
here's what I need from you.
All right?
And then in a nice way,

1673
01:41:33.901 --> 01:41:37.110
you got to tell it to stop spending all your money on stupid shit.

1674
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:40.800
All right?
That's what you gotta do.

1675
01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:45.990
And I'm telling you the key when you're fucking trying to make some headway and

1676
01:41:45.991 --> 01:41:48.510
your relationship is with the woman,

1677
01:41:48.511 --> 01:41:53.310
is you can't lose your fucking cool,
all right?
And they will,

1678
01:41:53.311 --> 01:41:57.060
if,
if you back them into a corner sometimes when they're doing something wrong,

1679
01:41:57.061 --> 01:41:59.340
because the Cubans,
they're going to do something wrong.
When you back,

1680
01:41:59.341 --> 01:42:02.370
I'm in the corner and they did something wrong.
Watch out.

1681
01:42:02.371 --> 01:42:06.360
If they start attacking you all right with shit that has nothing to do what

1682
01:42:06.361 --> 01:42:09.180
you're arguing about,
like you're arguing about,
you know,
you know,

1683
01:42:09.181 --> 01:42:11.690
whatever you like,
you,
you fucking,
um,

1684
01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.150
she keeps leaving the TV on and going to bed and it's on all night.

1685
01:42:15.151 --> 01:42:19.130
She's fucking whatever,
whatever the fuck that died causes the,

1686
01:42:19.131 --> 01:42:23.130
the electric bill to go up.
If all of a sudden she starts going,
well,
you know,

1687
01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:27.390
you just mad cause you know you're just short or she attacks you for that or

1688
01:42:27.391 --> 01:42:31.620
some other bullshit or just you're just a fucking ass hole right there.

1689
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:34.460
She just abandoned her argument and what,
what she's doing now,

1690
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:38.100
she's just trying to make you mad so that she can steer the argument into some

1691
01:42:38.101 --> 01:42:42.810
other bullshit or just hopefully get you to say something so fucked up that it,

1692
01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:46.140
uh,
it just totally camouflage has,
you know,

1693
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.080
the bullshit that she did to start the fucking argument basically.

1694
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.460
So just keep your cool.
You got to sit down.
You got it dude.
You got four girls,

1695
01:42:53.490 --> 01:42:55.140
you got four kids with this,
with this girl,

1696
01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.870
why you're attached at the hip with this woman.
Okay?

1697
01:42:57.871 --> 01:43:00.570
So what you want to do is try to have a good time.
You're good guy.

1698
01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.050
You work in your fucking ass off.
Okay?

1699
01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:09.150
She needs to appreciate that.
And uh,
she has to appreciate that,
you know,
uh,

1700
01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:09.961
you know,
what do you want to do?

1701
01:43:09.961 --> 01:43:11.780
You want to fucking whatever the fuck you're doing.

1702
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:13.500
You didn't want to walk around picking up,
uh,

1703
01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:17.400
spongebob squarepants stuffed animals all day.

1704
01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:23.180
You know,
you gotta be like,
sweetheart,
you had four fucking kids.
See,

1705
01:43:23.181 --> 01:43:26.090
this is why I'm not good at it.
We sweet you had four fucking kids.

1706
01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:31.440
The fuck do you think was gonna Happen?
You know,
get your tubes tied.

1707
01:43:31.441 --> 01:43:33.690
It's quit bitching at me.
See,
that's the first pass.

1708
01:43:33.691 --> 01:43:37.710
That's the first way I would say and buy.
You get to the end.
You just say,
listen,

1709
01:43:37.711 --> 01:43:41.130
I,
you know,
I love you.
You love me.
We have four beautiful kids.

1710
01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.980
We have to work together.
It's definitely a trying time.

1711
01:43:43.981 --> 01:43:46.200
It being this young with all these kids,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1712
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:49.380
And I'm telling you,
your,
your,
your life will be like,
it'll be better.

1713
01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.550
It'll be better if you work it out,

1714
01:43:50.551 --> 01:43:54.680
but the worst you want to do is coming her after you've had a few pops and said,

1715
01:43:54.681 --> 01:43:57.540
listen,
let me tell you something.
You'd dump content.
All right?

1716
01:43:57.690 --> 01:44:00.350
The backbone of this fucking country.
You don't want to come at her that way.

1717
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:02.990
All right?
You stupid bitch.
I'm fucking working my balls off.

1718
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:07.580
Why don't you go out there and that God dip fucking oil rig all day.
You know,

1719
01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.670
once you go down the pharmacy and get on the fucking pill,

1720
01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.460
maybe you won't have to be picking up so much shit.
All right,

1721
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:16.970
well let me know to pull out,
you'd say dumb shit like that.
You know,

1722
01:44:16.971 --> 01:44:19.190
and then you're gonna have a,
you're gonna have a fucking horrific relationship.

1723
01:44:19.191 --> 01:44:20.024
You don't want to do that.

1724
01:44:20.170 --> 01:44:23.410
<v 2>So that's it.
That's a podcast for this week.
Everybody.
And as I mentioned,</v>

1725
01:44:23.411 --> 01:44:27.430
I am up on Twitter now and actually enjoying it.
I have made peace with the,

1726
01:44:27.431 --> 01:44:30.940
with the tweeting.
You don't,
I feel like right now I feel like a,
uh,

1727
01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:34.990
I feel like Johnny Damon when he went to the Yankees as a trashing twittering,

1728
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.880
but now I'm fucking,
you know,
shaved my beard,
got a haircut.
Oh,
you know,

1729
01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:44.710
I'm just going to credit,
come in and contribute on Twitter or wherever I can.
I,

1730
01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.570
no,
it's not that bad.
It's not that bad.
It's just typical me.
I am,
uh,

1731
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:53.440
I'm an old soul.
I'm a crabby 80 year old as a 42 year old.
I am.

1732
01:44:53.970 --> 01:44:54.240
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1734
01:44:56.670 --> 01:44:59.640
<v 2>I didn't like Facebook.
I still don't really like it,
but,</v>

1735
01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.860
<v 9>um,
I'm at the mercy.
Are you guys,
you guys all go to Twitter?</v>

1736
01:45:03.861 --> 01:45:06.400
What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You know,

1737
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:10.760
I stayed on my space as long as I could.
I felt like I was in a ghost town,

1738
01:45:10.761 --> 01:45:14.840
like some old miner town that dried up and I was just sitting there listening to

1739
01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:18.560
the rusty hinge is,
you know,
is the door swing swung back and forth?
Oh,

1740
01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:21.170
Jesus Bell.
We get it.
Stop being so fucking dramatic.

1741
01:45:22.330 --> 01:45:22.600
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

1742
01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:27.190

You're a tweeter.
Um,

1745
01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:32.943
<v 6>Fuck yourself.</v>

1746
01:46:18.150 --> 01:46:21.190
Illuminate main street from the cinema.

1747
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:27.350
We don't care about no government.

1748
01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:35.690
45.
Wow.
