00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.883
Wow.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.310
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.610
May 18th,
2015 how's it going?
Ah,

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.070
I'm fucking wiped out and wiped out,
you know,

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.660
not because I did all these shows here,
you know,

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.650
not because they put in maximum effort to make sure everybody got their money's

7
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:27.460
worth patting myself on the back.
Not because of that.
You know why?

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.450
Because I'm an asshole and I went out every night until like three,
four,

9
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:36.310
five o'clock in the fucking morning.
Like I'm still in my twenties,
you know,

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.550
every fucking night.
I know.
I always say right before the second show,

11
00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:43.570
I'd be like,
Hey,
Versium,
there's,
um,
it's going to be an early one.
You know,

12
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.470
he's going to be an early one out.
Fuck.
Who's texting me now?
Come on man.

13
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.670
Leave me alone.
Can you just leave me alone?
Um,

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.000
every fucking second show,
I would just be like,
Hey,
I'm fucking a,

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.870
I'm going to call an early one and verse.
It'd be like,
oh,

16
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:03.630
I don't do whatever you want to do.
Do whatever you want to do.
Right.

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.050
And then I'd be so amped up after the show,
I'd be like,
all right,

18
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.020
let me just have one little heater here backstage.
Right.

19
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:14.850
Somebody gave us a bottle of fucking Woodford reserve,
whatever the hell it was.

20
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.440
I do a shot and then that was,
it took a sip of the devil,
right?

21
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:22.920
And then I got the demon in my veins and the devil starts talking,
hey,

22
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:25.480
why don't you go smoke a cigar?
I,
why don't you go fucking over here?

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.880
Why don't you go over there every fucking night?
Every night.

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.460
I've been here for 10 days.
I've gone out every single night.

25
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.710
I'm on a fucking bag,

26
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.200
<v 0>right?
What am I doing?</v>

27
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.830
<v 1>Last night was the first night I just did my shows and I fucking went home and</v>

28
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:47.180
Joe Barton,
Huck Rosebowl tailgate ledge,
Joe Barton,

29
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:50.550
nick came up from New York to hang and watch the show.

30
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:54.910
Actually jumped on and did some time on the second show.
And uh,
I got Bart,

31
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:57.840
nick and Paul Versey staring at me.
Right.

32
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.800
Of course I want to go,
of course I want to go out.
Right.

33
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.160
But do I know last night was the first night I said I can't.

34
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.170
Why?
Because I learned my lessons,

35
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.270
my lesson after fucking nine days in a row of being an absolute shit head.

36
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.880
Now the only reason why I didn't go out again last night was cause oh,

37
00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:23.050
freckles was getting the sniffles.
I caught a cold,
put an asshole,

38
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.370
kind of a fucking asshole goes out until four or five o'clock in the morning

39
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.990
when he's turning 47 the next goddamn month.

40
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.250
Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?
I'll tell you why.
Cause I'm a moron.

41
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.560
And you know something.
A lot of you guys listening right now,

42
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.190
you might be laughing.
You know,
I'd be going,
yeah,
what are you a fucking idiot?

43
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.110
Now you know what you are,
you're a parent.

44
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.290
And he got kids so you don't have any choice.

45
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:50.260
I don't have to fucking wake up to anybody.
You know?

46
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.230
You know that shit when you're laying in bed and your fucking kid walks in,

47
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.790
he started dreaming of an obscene phone call and you realize that some Todd,

48
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.920
they're going,
yeah,

49
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.370
you rps that Shit right?
I don't have to deal with that.

50
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.270
I don't have to fucking deal with that.
So something's got to give,
you know,

51
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.410
we can't have all that freedom,
you know,
something's got to balance it out.

52
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.770
So area I got a cold and my fucking liver felt like,

53
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:19.540
so I took a fucking liver shot or something.
Um,
anyways,
so,

54
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.550
uh,
you know,
the worst part about this cold is,
is um,

55
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.870
I'm sort of fighting it off cause I went and I got eight hours sleep.
You know,

56
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.200
I'm in that line stage.
We just like,
oh,
it's not going to get any worse.
You know,

57
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.440
basically what's going to happen today is the second I exert myself doing

58
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:43.300
anything like lifting,
lifting,
like a spoonful of raisin bran to my mouth.

59
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.940
That's going to be the tipping point.
You know what I mean?

60
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.400
With the momentum has just changed.

61
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:53.350
But a cold virus right there and then it's just going to be over.

62
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:58.300
So I know tonight
I'm going to be sick.
Um,

63
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.220
at which point I'm going to Pout,

64
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.790
which means I'm going to drink and I'm going to smoke with,
to going.
But

65
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.750
he believed that 47,
literally sliding into 50,
and I'm still behaving that with,

66
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.380
it's a very sad thing to everybody and um,

67
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.260
but I have nobody to blame but myself.
Other than that though,

68
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.710
I want to tell you the show's been going great and uh,

69
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.240
and a bunch of friends and family come out and last night on the late show had

70
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:30.040
none other than,
uh,
the one man thrill ride.

71
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.440
Jimmy Preston came down,
fucking great guy.
Um,

72
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.790
he's shooting the shit with them and he's got some big things coming up,

73
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.260
some big auditions to move up the wrestling ranks.
And I'm telling you,

74
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:47.230
I called it,
I told you at least a year and a half,
two years ago.

75
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.040
I'm telling you the guy's a fucking star.
Um,

76
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.280
if you haven't seen any of his clips,
I'll try and re,

77
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.290
I always say I'm going to put the videos up,

78
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.420
but I'm scatterbrained by the time I get to the end of this shit.

79
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:00.550
I forget what I'm going to try to make sure.

80
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:04.420
If you don't just look up one minute thrill ride.
Um,

81
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.780
he's the fucking best man.
Fucking hilarious.

82
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:12.490
Does his wrestling promos in his car,
you know,
without a shirt on,

83
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.200
screaming at him.
I'm telling you,

84
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:17.920
it's been a while since the WWE got somebody really,

85
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:21.080
really great on the mic.
And,
um,

86
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.060
I think this guy real,
I'm telling you,
I think he's going to,
he's going to get,

87
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.980
he's going to get to the show,
I believe is what they call it.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,

88
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:33.580
Barton it came down last night.
Fucking absolutely destroyed,

89
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.820
destroyed on the second show.
This is what an fucking maniac Barton,

90
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.530
the kiss.
I've never heard Boston crowds grown.

91
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.240
It takes a lot to make a Boston grown and he had like five of them.

92
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.160
So of course me and Virginia fucking crying,
laughing on the side of the stage.

93
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.270
And um,
but you know,
when,

94
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.430
you know those five times when they weren't and they fucking died laughing at

95
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:00.960
the other hundred jokes,
he uh,
he absolutely killed it.

96
00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:04.910
So tonight is the last night.
The last night.
Oh,

97
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:08.720
the last night for jokes.

98
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

99
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.870
<v 1>Uh,
summer cold makes me feel awful.
Um,</v>

100
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.670
so anyways,
so what am I going to do today?
Am I going to take it easy?

101
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.840
Well you know,

102
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.760
I gotta fucking upload this thing at Starbucks cause my parents have fucking

103
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.420
parent in our net,
which is basically a,
I dunno,

104
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.800
dial up 2.0 my mom always drives me now she's like,

105
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.340
hey we have the internet,
I have the Internet.

106
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:37.990
It's like yeah you got one of those glow sticks.

107
00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:40.910
You stick on the side of your fucking computer so you have,
you have it,

108
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.730
you have Internet all day long.
I don't fuck it.
Have Internet.
Um,

109
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.200
so then I always have to go up to the Starbucks and I got to stand in the

110
00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.690
fucking junkie line.
You know what I mean?

111
00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:55.660
Cause I got to find out what the God damn password is and all that shit.

112
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.450
Plus I always feel like a fucking Mooch,
you know,

113
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.080
I at least always buy a bottle of water and I gotta stay on my immediate to Chai

114
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:04.150
latte with a fucking presell frazzled,

115
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.730
just sitting and standing in line,

116
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.270
fucking drinks coffee in the middle of the day.
You're a junkie.
Okay.

117
00:07:12.271 --> 00:07:14.430
You want a glass to wake up,
you know,

118
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.210
cause you're not a morning person because you're weak.
Right.

119
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.890
I always love calling people weak.
Like I shouldn't have died years ago,
you know,

120
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.770
and I had my ruptured appendix.
I would've been taken out of the fucking mix.

121
00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:30.420
You know what a dyed sweating under fucking 200 blankets in the 18 hundreds

122
00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:33.840
spinoff.
No,
they had to figure out how to cure that shit in the air.
It is.

123
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.960
Cause they did that.
Now you have to sit there and listen to me every week.

124
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.690
Why do you have to,
you have all the power,

125
00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:43.320
but you're playing the victim once again,
acting as though you can't,

126
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.210
you can't shut it off.
So,
um,
I got to tell you guys,

127
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:51.180
I'm,
I know I tweeted about this and I can't believe I didn't bring up my last

128
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:54.690
podcast.
I want to give a shout out to Jessie's customs.
No,

129
00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:59.610
Jesse's custom design.
A airbrush studio that's right here in,

130
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.260
uh,
Boston and I don't want to butcher his last name is Jesse.

131
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.510
Oh,
what the fuck?
We'll give it a try.

132
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:08.440
<v 0>Okay,</v>

133
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.510
<v 1>I see.
Okay.
I Dunno,
it's ACC,</v>

134
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.510
like the college division I a,
c,
c,
a,

135
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.540
n this guy came in one night and handed me one of the sickest things anybody's

136
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.830
ever given me.
Skype,
custom airbrushes,
goalie mask,

137
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.280
motorcycle helmets.
So he came in knowing I'm a Bruins fan.

138
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.730
He went out and bought an official like Nhl level goalie mask and then custom

139
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:40.840
painted that thing like I was going to be playing golf for the Bruins.

140
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.670
And uh,

141
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:48.090
on one side of it he had airbrushed a microphone with George Carlin and Richard

142
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.920
Pryor on the other side.
He had the drum stuff,
he had Bonham's sign,
you know,

143
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.880
from the [inaudible] album,
whatever the fuck you call it.

144
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.000
Then he just had the skull part of the skull,

145
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.130
Steven Adler skull from the appetite for destruction,

146
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.200
destruction album with GNR sorta put on and on the back,
you know,

147
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:11.160
on the one that protects the back of your head.
He had airbrushed,
um,

148
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.190
a picture of Patrice O'Neil from the first benefit poster that Bobby Kelly,

149
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:20.370
I believe,
to help design.
And then on top he had go fuck yourself.

150
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.310
Um,
and what was great was the fuck was the Ford symbol and a,

151
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:29.580
I have the Ford f 100.
It was fucking unreal.
Um,

152
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.110

There's no apostrophe www dot Jesse's custom design.com.

158
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.310
Um,
he does airbrushing pin striping,

00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:59.880
gold leaf truck lettering,
motorcycles,
helmets,

160
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.350
and evidently hockey mass.
He's fucking really,
really talented.
And um,

161
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.500
that's something,
I swear to God,
I'll have that thing for the rest of my life.

162
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:10.470
There's no way I'm getting rid of it ever.
Why would I ever get rid of it?

163
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.950
It's fucking awesome.
So anyways,
back to the podcast there.

164
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.160
Um,
so my world's been very small lately.
I don't know what I mean.

165
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.320
Even going to talk about this week because I've just been fucking drink until

166
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.780
four in the morning.
Oh,
I'll tell you some stories.
Okay.

167
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:26.730
So I was hanging out with a bunch of high school buddies,

168
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:31.170
Sachet fucking Saturday,
Saturday night,

169
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:34.920
right?
Drinking,
having a good time or whatever.

170
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.400
And uh,
we ended up going to leave in the end of the night,
you know,

171
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.840
they turn on the lights and shits,
everybody's going to leave.
And um,
it's funny,

172
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:45.780
down by the Wilbur theater is like,
there's all these clubs down there.

173
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:49.920
It's like the meatpacking district in New York,
but like a Boston,
you know,

174
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.530
so it's smaller and cleaner,
you know what I mean?
I'm with smarter sports fans.

175
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.750
Jesus.
So,
um,

176
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.550
we're standing there,

177
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.580
me and two of my buddies in this two comes up asking for change and he's like,

178
00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:12.750
hey man,
you know,
Vaughn on her times mag and you helped me out,
blah blah blah,

179
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:15.150
blah blah.
So I'd stand there.
Right.

180
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.660
And then two friends digging into their pockets,
you know,

181
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.710
taken out dollar bills and shit.
And I'm looking at the kid,
you know,

182
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.930
he's got fucking this mane of Brown,
shiny hair,
totally conditioned.

183
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:31.680
He's got a nice pair of glasses on.
He's got this clean ass,

184
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:36.060
bright orange shirt with a couple of rope.
Next list is around it.

185
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:37.710
And I just taught,
you know,
I started teasing him.

186
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.910
It's go Jesus to look at yourself,
look at your,
your hair's all condition.

187
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:46.110
You got to,
you look like you're producing a show with those glasses.
You know,

188
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.110
I've got a couple of necklaces and by then he's already got the money.

189
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.950
So I'm basically in a roundabout way suggest and that he's not that hard.

190
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.500
So he just fucking stares at me.
And then he just holds the money out back to us.

191
00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.940
Like he's going to give it back.

192
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.330
Like if you're going to question my integrity as a street person,

193
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.220
I don't think I want this.
Right?
So I reached over and I took it back,

194
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.220
that gave it to my friends.

195
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.780
So now we stand in there and I know he wants the money,

196
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:21.060
but he's got to keep playing this bluff,
right?
So he starts walking away all sad,

197
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:24.930
like fucking bill Bixby at the end of the hulk and none of us say anything.

198
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.260
So then he does an about face.
He's like,
come on guys,
I need the money.
You know,

199
00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:34.920
to fuck you fucking,
you know,
I can't help the way I look.
I need the money.

200
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:38.730
But then as he's saying this,
one of my friends is not looking at him.

201
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:41.280
He's just staring straight ahead and he says Cisco and do it.
It's over.

202
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.090
It's over.
Walk away.
Just walk away.
It's as he's yelling over the top,

203
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.960
but I needed money and blah blah.
He's just gone.
It's over,
dude.
It's over.

204
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.170
Just just,
just walk away,
walk away.
So he's making such a fuss.

205
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.880
One of the door guys at the w hotel,
which is right across the street from,
uh,

206
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.170
from the Wilbur comes walking over telling the kid,
he needs to calm down.

207
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:03.790
You need to calm down.
And kids go,

208
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:06.030
nick gave me money and then they took a bag of blah,
blah,
blah.

209
00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:08.310
And we're not saying anything.
And as he's yelling,

210
00:13:08.311 --> 00:13:13.140
he's looking over us and it just so happens,
this dude,
no wheelchair comes by,

211
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.830
right?
This homeless guy in a wheelchair,
one of those guys lose legs,
still work.

212
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:21.180
So He's,
he's walking down the street on his heels,
you know,
walking frontwards,

213
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.330
sitting in a wheelchair.
And my buddy who was going like,
dude,
it's over.

214
00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:27.480
It's over.
Sees the guy in the wheelchair.
And he goes,
there it is.

215
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.660
And he walked over and he gave him the money and my other buddy gave him the

216
00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:34.770
money.
And then the fucking white kid in the orange shirt just flipped out.

217
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.090
You look at our monkey fucking throwing his hands up in the L.
Dot.
Fuck Blah,

218
00:13:39.091 --> 00:13:43.990
blah,
blah,
blah.
He stormed across the street
and,
uh,

219
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.960
I got to tell you,
it made my fucking night.
You know,
I don't know,
man.

220
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:52.110
I'm reverse racist when it comes to fucking beggars.
You know what I mean?

221
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.360
You gotta be pretty fucking filthy.
You know,

222
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.260
as a white person,
you got to look like boxcar Willie.
You know what I mean?

223
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:03.030
You know?
Got to have like no teeth.
You know,
people,

224
00:14:03.031 --> 00:14:05.190
when people don't have any teeth that constantly chewing,

225
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.740
you got to look like that.
You know,

226
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.100
maybe a stick with a handkerchief and a fucking stale sandwich in there.

227
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.590
Then all day I'll help you out.
All right,

228
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.800
but if you're in your 20s,
come on,
you know my wrong here.

229
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.290
You're fucking white kid.

230
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.740
You're a white guy in your 20s living in the United States of America may swell

231
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.660
bit about this.
You're fucking crushing it,
you know,
crushing it.
Go home.

232
00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:35.710
Call me,
you know,
sell your fucking skateboard,
dude,
I don't,

233
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.300
I don't know what you fucking want from me.
Um,
and let's say,

234
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:42.580
you know what the word,
if they says homeless vet,

235
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.020
then I do it our rack veteran or something.
Then I give the money.

236
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.390
If it's a white dude,
you know,
so there you go.

237
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.920
People who are pretending to be homeless but not,
or whatever,

238
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:55.610
you were rebelling against your rich parents.
All you need to do to get me,

239
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:57.170
it's just putting on a pair of fatigues.

240
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:00.230
Get them a little bit dirty and then act like you were in Iraq even though you

241
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:04.190
weren't.
And I'll give you the money.
They get go.
That's how it works.

242
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.490
Someone else probably fucking me.
He just had a douchey face.

243
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.050
It just bugged me.
It just be just,
he looked fine.

244
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.560
It looked fine.
Maybe it was in the beginning of drug addiction is which pounds?

245
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.120
Just throw them out.
So we had all these new clothes.
Um,
I don't fucking know.

246
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.580
I Dunno.
Was that mean?
Was that awful?
Um,
all right.

247
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:32.510
And other news,

248
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.060
what's going on in the world of nothing matters or whatever the fuck I usually

249
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:40.610
say the world of absolutely nothing.

250
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.630
So Tom Brady's going to appeal this suspension.
Of course.

251
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.130
By the way,
I want somebody in the,
and the last 40 years and me watching sports,

252
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:52.760
I want somebody to fucking find something less.
40 years,
a more,

253
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.670
something dumb or they get suspended for four fucking games.

254
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.050
All right,
so the Patriots are going to appeal it.

255
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.080
Obviously the Patriots actually just sat down and wrote a 20,000 word report in

256
00:16:08.721 --> 00:16:11.300
rebuttal to this wells report.
I mean,

257
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.360
how many fucking trees are we going to cut down and chop down over this fucking

258
00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:21.851
horse shit before everybody just admits that schermer say is a fucking baby.

259
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.020
You know what I mean?
So now good Dale,
who's just,

260
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:29.660
every time he should zig,
he fucking zags.

261
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:35.050
So Brady's going to appeal it and Roger Goodell is going to be the arbitrator to

262
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.770
fucking choke.
It was a witch hunt from day one and now you got a kangaroo court,

263
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.790
it's fucking hilarious.
You're going to arbitrate the fucking thing that,

264
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.780
that's like a farm fucking showing you and then I'm going to be the judge.

265
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:50.450
Who Do you think's gonna win?
It's the dumbest shit ever.

266
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:55.280
I think this is actually going to end up in a real court at which point it will

267
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:59.210
be laughed out and it'll be over now.

268
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:03.080
I think they could still could suspend them because the corporations are allowed

269
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:07.910
to have,
you know,
rules within the rules of society.

270
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.870
So I mean Shit,
take a GE,
they,
they wanted to,

271
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:15.140
they could say you could never play football again because at the end of the day

272
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.990
it is a corporation that Tom Brady works for.

273
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.440
It's absolute fucking bullshit though.

274
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.970
And what I'm really enjoying is the people that are taking it seriously,

275
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.850
that are really looking at like,
yeah dude,
he is a fucking cheat.

276
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:32.070
Or like this whole thing is in complete horseshit.
Um,

277
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.450
what's great about it is it's always those mouth breathers moron.

278
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.760
I haven't found one intelligent fan that I have talked to that actually thinks

279
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:44.990
that this isn't fucking stupid.
You know,
who thinks this is fucking real

280
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.760
people who go to fucking sports bars and I know fans go to sports bars too and I

281
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:55.761
know that there's the mouth breathing fucking moron demographic of the Patriots

282
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:57.084
fan base,

283
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.680
but I'm to all those other ones from the 31 other teams because they fucking

284
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:05.550
hate the patriots.
Those people who go all day,
all day,

285
00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:07.081
you know,

286
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:11.460
fucking high five and we were in a God damned Jersey with fucking hot wing sauce

287
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:16.140
all over your fucking goatee.
Those dopes,
those mantated dopes.

288
00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:20.220
They're,
they will forever say that they're fucking cheetahs.
But you know what?

289
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.400
I'm fine with it cause they fucking morons.
But I'll tell you right now,

290
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:24.061
Tom Brady,

291
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:29.061
one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time is being fucking railroaded on such

292
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:34.050
a ridiculous fucking level.
They just ignore and everything.

293
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:36.030
They're ignoring that they don't have any fucking evidence.

294
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.760
All they have is circumstantial horseshit.

295
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.250
They're ignoring the fact this guy overinflate says,
guy heats up the ball,

296
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.210
quarterbacks from the past that had the fucking jets quarterback came out.

297
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.600
He's fucking going on and on and on about how he used to do that all the fucking

298
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:52.410
time and that guy sucked.
Didn't make him play any better.

299
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.270
Jesus Christ.
Why don't you fucking,
I dunno,
I,

300
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.490
I know I've been talking about this three times in a row,

301
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.310
but I'll continue to talk about it because I think it's absolute fucking

302
00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:03.810
horseshit.
Obviously.

303
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:08.760
If he didn't fucking realize it by now that I think it's absolute bullshit.
Um,

304
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.590
so anyways,
with that,

305
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.650
with that fucking half a cunt hair of air out of the ball and that's why you

306
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:18.420
lost by 38 points.
Really?

307
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:21.360
That's all I need to do to start throwing strikes when they get out there.

308
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.130
Good fucking Lord.
Good.

309
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:29.850
Let's like finding somebody in the NBA for cheating because of what?

310
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:33.810
The level that he wears his socks.
Well,
he had his socks too low.

311
00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:36.960
That's why he hit those fucking 12 three point is to fucking beat us.

312
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.910
Gimme a break Jim,

313
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:43.911
or say is the biggest fucking baby baby fucking owner ever get that guy a

314
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:48.000
fucking passive fire.

315
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.000
We laws.
There must be something wrong with the rules.

316
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.620
Somebody change them.
Oh wait,
I sit on the rules committee.

317
00:19:58.621 --> 00:20:02.010
I think I'll change them.
All right,
here we go.

318
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.470
Let's do a couple of reads here for the weaker fuck.

319
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:10.140
Starting to fucking congested here to get fucked and congested here.
Oh right.

320
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.030
Speaking of sports,

321

everybody had you heard the new,

322

I mean you're betting on golf.

327

Who the fuck does all these shows?
I wasn't taking any vitamins.

388
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.780
It's fucking hilarious.
You know my mom said this morning,
I said,
um,

389
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:39.220
my mom's like,
hey,
how you doing?
You know?
Hey,
how you doing?
What's going on?

390
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.490
This is,
uh,
the mom morning podcast.
She says,
Hey,
I do.
He said,
I,
you know,

391
00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:48.140
I caught a cold.
I've caught a cold.
You know what she said to me?
She said,
well,

392
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.460
what did you think was gonna Happen?

393
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.710
So that
right there,

394
00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.920
it's all you need to know about me.
That's what she said.

395
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.240
Not One of those.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

396
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:08.550
Do you want some fucking Kooky Mooky fucking God coco.

397
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.470
She just fucking gave it to me straight.
What?

398
00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:12.620
What'd you think was going to happen?

399
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.220
The only thing was missing was your fucking dope.

400
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.670
You've been going out till four in the morning every night for fucking 10 days.

401
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.680
What'd you think was going to happen?

402
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.860
She's always been like that and it always bugged me,

403
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:27.980
but I realized as an adult it really helped me out.
You know,

404
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.660
when I watch other guys walking around,

405
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:33.410
you know who hadn't like moms that hugged him and shit,
the littlest thing,

406
00:25:33.411 --> 00:25:37.010
they get flustered.
You know,
I'm out of toothpaste,
right?

407
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.970
They tried to marry some woman that's going to be there next mom.
You know,

408
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.370
you got to have one of those moms just got a little bit of ice in our veins

409
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:45.920
every once in a while,
right?
Like every morning I was a kid.

410
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.190
I had this piece of shit truck,
right?
It was nice,

411
00:25:49.191 --> 00:25:53.090
but I kept it forever because I was smart and I knew that I didn't want to work

412
00:25:53.091 --> 00:25:53.901
for somebody else.

413
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:57.890
And one of the quickest ways to working for somebody else for the rest of your

414
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:01.700
life is to buy a new car.
When you're in your 20s,
you know when you can quote,

415
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:03.980
afford the payment.
I got news for you.

416
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:07.460
You can't afford the payment if you have a dream.
All right?

417
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.370
Then I had a dream to tell shit jokes for 19 nights in a fucking 10 nights in a

418
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:16.310
row.
Um,
so anyways,
so my truck wasn't,

419
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.370
wasn't starting all right.

420
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:22.400
And I fucking called her up from

421
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.380
this little packy store.
I called her up.
I was like,
mom.
I was like,

422
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:30.740
I think I was like 19 or 20.
It was like,
mom,
my truck won't start.

423
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.540
I turned the keys,
dude started and I know I got to go here and I,

424
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.440
my truck was terrible,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

425
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.220
They did the whole fucking hissy fit for a minute and then she just goes,

426
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:45.190
there was a pause and she just goes,
well,
what would you have me do?

427
00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:51.370
I just want to be like,
oh shit.
All right,
I guess that's right.

428
00:26:51.371 --> 00:26:52.450
She is not a mechanic.

429
00:26:52.451 --> 00:26:55.840
I think I need to get the fuck out the yellow pages and look up a fucking tow

430
00:26:55.841 --> 00:26:59.140
truck.
That's what I had to do.
That's what we had to do back in the day.
Children,

431
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.020
it wasn't all at our fingertips.
You fucking babies with the smart phones.

432
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.200
We're going to take out a fucking,

433
00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:13.410
the yellow pages knowing full well that most likely the page you want had been

434
00:27:13.511 --> 00:27:17.980
torn out,
buy some dope.
That was the thing where I need the number,

435
00:27:17.981 --> 00:27:20.290
I can't remember it,
and they would tear it out

436
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.830
for whatever fucking reason.
Then he had,
you know,
he had to go,

437
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.330
go inside and buy a pack of gum that you didn't even want or a candy bar so you

438
00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:34.080
could have changed for the phone and then you fucking called up.
You know?

439
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.350
Isn't that hilarious?
I'm acting like I worked on a farm.

440
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.030
We had a look of phone number up in a book that was right there next to a phone

441
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.990
and then we had to get a sweet treat to have changed,
to make a phone call.

442
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.080
Hey,
I'll tell you,
it was rough,
you know?
Oh,
fucking far off.
You know,

443
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:56.910
we've gone from people talking about coming over here and boats to the fucking

444
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:58.650
depression,
the dust bowl,

445
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:04.100
world war right to me talking about sitting at a payphone and buying a package,

446
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.630
juicy fruit.
Oh it was really hard.
Um,

447
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.660
anyways,
so where the hell am I?
Um,
I dunno,

448
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.810
I'm going to go to fucking GNC.

449
00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:23.020

Some psychos fucking put together that does not have to go through the FDA.

453
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:35.010
Why don't you put this through your veins and you know what?
I'm going to do it.

454
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.873

You might've seen some of his specials on Netflix or you might've seen him at

468
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:19.071
the 99 restaurant and Belviq a Massachusetts back in the day.

469
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.060
Um,
no,
that's a good topic.
Anybody here in Massachusetts?

470
00:29:24.061 --> 00:29:28.290
Some of the fucking places I used to work I used to do the 99.

471
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:33.060
Isn't Bell Rick on a Tuesday night,
John David used to host it.
Um,

472
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.420
I used to go up there,
unknown Patrice rest his soul.
Dane Cook,
Bobby Kelly,

473
00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:44.421
all of us used to go up there every Tuesday the ninth going up to the nines.

474
00:29:44.451 --> 00:29:45.284
Right.

475
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.160
I remember it was in the middle of fucking nowhere to you just drove down this

476
00:29:49.161 --> 00:29:53.930
hill.
It's like they wiped out like 6,000 trees to put this fucking thing up.

477
00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:58.820
And a,
I used to work that one.
The comedy vault,

478
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.070
the Dick Doroty Ramzi [inaudible] there was one night in Cambridge,

479
00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:08.970
I don't know where the fuck it was.
And then there was one out in Worcester.
Um,

480
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:15.540
all of that shit.
All that shit has been Kelly's Kelly's something pub.

481
00:30:15.541 --> 00:30:19.900
And uh,
in north Redding,
I think it was on reading,

482
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:24.010
it was in Redding,
Massachusetts.
The first place I have a bond.
Um,

483
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.930
and where I met a buddy of mine,
Wayne Previti.
Um,

484
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.470
so whatever he's been doing that all week.
Um,

485
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.320
there's always been people in the crowd,

486
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:38.150
like some older people remember in this fucking room is laughing off.
Fuck,

487
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.250
I'm getting all stuffed up here.
God Damn it.
Um,

488
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.670
oh yeah.
Memories do those rooms down in Rhode Island sky.

489
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:52.540
John Perrotto I think is coming out tonight.
It was like the fucking,

490
00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:55.390
the first straight shooter I met.
He's always,

491
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:59.630
what's going on brother John Peralta?
What's going on,
Bro?
Listen,

492
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.570
I got a room down here.
I can pay about 25 bucks.
What do you say,
brothers?

493
00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:07.960
You'd come up,
you knock it out.
You're always doing a good job,
right?

494
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.200
You'd be like,
yeah,
John,
anything for you man,
I need the money.
I appreciate it.

495
00:31:11.201 --> 00:31:13.420
Oh,
I brought it up.
She,
when you get down there,

496
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.320
he's like a former wrestler.
What's going on brother John Browder?
Um,

497
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:25.540
he used to work for bill downs and they used to call him bill,

498
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:29.160
no money down because you'd get there and he was struggling.

499
00:31:29.161 --> 00:31:31.390
He was one of these guys was make a lot of money in the fucking,

500
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.090
the big eighties.
And then,
uh,

501
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.330
him and his partner split and his partner fucked him over.
And uh,
so he was,

502
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:41.380
he was a good guy,
but he's always scraping,
trying to scrape the money together.

503
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.090
And uh,
you know,
he'd fucked you owe you 50 bucks,

504
00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:49.530
you'd have to drive to his house.
And he'd be like,
Hey,
big guy.
Big Guy.
All right,

505
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.260
I can give you like eight bucks.
I can give you eight.
He give you like $8 of it,

506
00:31:53.261 --> 00:31:56.440
like you'd have to go to his house like nine times to collect 30 bucks.

507
00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:01.660
It's fucking hilarious.
Um,
it wasn't at the time,
but now when I look back,

508
00:32:01.661 --> 00:32:05.080
all of that shit was,
yeah,
big guy,
big guy.
I hit and I'll tell you,
big guy.

509
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:06.490
And um,

510
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:12.750
and one time Greg Fitzsimmons was coming up from New York and he was closing one

511
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:16.930
of this guys rooms,
right?
And he had already heard the rumors that he didn't pay.

512
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.610
So he fucking goes on.

513
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:20.500
I think I already told the story of what I would tell it again.

514
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:24.310
He fucking goes on right before he goes on stage for his final set,

515
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.470
he says to downs,
he said,
aw man.
He goes,
you know what?
I forgot my watch mate.

516
00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:32.080
Can I borrow your watch so I don't go over and you know,
Bill down.
It's like,

517
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.570
oh yeah,
yeah.
Big Guy,
big guy.
Don't worry about ego.
Big Guy.
Right?

518
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:38.710
And it gives it to him.
It was a really nice fucking watch.
So Greg goes up,

519
00:32:38.711 --> 00:32:42.050
crushes,
finishes his set and immediately just goes right out the door,

520
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:47.030
jumps in his car and fucking drives back to New York.
So the next day,

521
00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:50.900
bill downs calls a month and he goes,
uh,
he goes,
hey,
big guy,

522
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.510
big guy.
He goes,
yeah,
you left man.
He goes,
you got my watch.
And Greg goes,
yeah,

523
00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.310
you got my check.
And there was a pause.
And then bill goes,
oh,

524
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:02.144
big guy.

525
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.260
So he waited to the fucking thing cleared and then he sent him his watch back

526
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.640
was fucking brilliant.

527
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.700
The kind of shit that I never would've thought to fucking do.
Um,

528
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:23.460
so anyways,
all of those stories have been coming back.
You know,

529
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.610
some of the guys who've been coming in town hanging and with just sitting there

530
00:33:26.611 --> 00:33:30.050
laughing and talking about all these fucking rooms we used to play in.
And um,

531
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.690
oh my God,
you'd go in there and they'd be like a Bruins game on and a,

532
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.710
this is back,
you know,
there's still playing in the garden.

533
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.110
Neely was playing and all of that shit.
So,
you know,

534
00:33:40.111 --> 00:33:42.540
they were the fucking second coming to the big bad Bruins.

535
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.290
Every game was exciting.
It was,
it was,
it was the early 90.

536
00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:50.970
So the second golden age of hockey,
and she was just coming to a close where,

537
00:33:50.971 --> 00:33:52.680
um,
you know,

538
00:33:52.681 --> 00:33:57.681
it was the perfect balance of physical play and just unbelievable golf scores.

539
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.020
Every team was in playing the trap.

540
00:34:01.021 --> 00:34:04.080
The players weren't fucking gigantic the way they are today.

541
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.070
It was before the clutch and grab era.
And,
um,

542
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.940
it was just awesome hockey.
So every fucking game it seemed was great.

543
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.560
A couple of great rushes and unbelievable goal and a couple of fights.

544
00:34:16.561 --> 00:34:20.370
It was just,
it was the fucking greatest.
And,
um,

545
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.630
we'd go in and do standup when these pubs and that people would have no idea

546
00:34:24.631 --> 00:34:25.690
there was a show diverse.

547
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:29.100
Always remember there was always supposed to be a sign and the guy never hung it

548
00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:31.890
up and they'd just be some fucking awful

549
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.140
ray,

550
00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.220
a fucking radio shack microphone or something and they would just cut the sound

551
00:34:38.221 --> 00:34:42.330
off on,
on the game,
right as people at the bar will gone.
Joe,

552
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.110
what the fuck I'm going to be like,
hey everybody,
welcome.
Welcome to the first,

553
00:34:46.111 --> 00:34:46.944
uh,

554
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:52.190
the first comedy night here at a sucker punch bar and fucking South Boston.

555
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.730
And we're going to try to do this every week and be able to shut the fuck up.

556
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.000
And he just sitting there hanging your head going,
all right,
here we go.

557
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.940
Gotta take my lumps.
And um,

558
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.370
but it was great like the comradery that you had with the other comics that you

559
00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:14.300
started out with doing those fucking hell rooms as they were called.

560
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.780
Um,
it was funny.

561
00:35:17.781 --> 00:35:20.740
It was how you went up and you learned how to,

562
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:26.110
how to keep your composure standing in front of a room full of people that hated

563
00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:30.440
you has been the only way to learn how to do that unless you are blessed is to

564
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:34.550
stand in front of a room full of people that hate you over and over and over

565
00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:38.440
again throughout the first.
I don't know how many,
you know,

566
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.070
until you fucking move up and you don't have to do them anymore.
And,
um,

567
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:47.490
it's an unbelievable skill to be able to,
to do well in,

568
00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.610
in a hotel room.
Like I haven't had to do those,
fortunately for a while.

569
00:35:51.611 --> 00:35:55.480
And I can guarantee you that if you put me up in one and nobody knew who I was,

570
00:35:55.481 --> 00:35:57.370
I would,
I would fucking eat my dick.

571
00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.390
I have wood because they wouldn't give a fuck.
And my skills to get them to,

572
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.520
to give a fuck would,
would not be sharp like they need to be.
So,

573
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.400
uh,
you know,
he's fucking theater gigs.
If they're there,

574
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.660
lay ups,
you know,
they're not like,
they're not like they used to be,
you know.

575
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:15.890
Anyway.
So,
um,

576
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.750
let's get to some of the questions here for the week or Billy headquartered
here.

577
00:36:20.751 --> 00:36:23.000
All right.
What do you MMP content.
All right,

578
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:28.190
Guy Guy who forgets his girlfriend's name.

579
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.360
How high can you fly?
You never,

580
00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:36.270
never reach those guys that in my fucking Skype pilot.
Oh,
I know.

581
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.160
Cause I've had Sirius radio all week.
Um,
all right.

582
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.560
Tons of replies and tweets about the email last week from the guy who forgot the

583
00:36:46.901 --> 00:36:50.710
girl's name.
He met this chick.
He fucking really liked her.

584
00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.570
He couldn't remember his fucking name,

585
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:57.130
her name and a pay waited too long to ask her.
So now he doesn't know what to do.

586
00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.690
So here's what they say.
They,
somebody said,
ask her to spell it.
I'll do it.

587
00:37:02.691 --> 00:37:05.830
That's like,
that's not even a 50,
50 roll of the dice.

588
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.480
How do you spell your name?
Jen.

589
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.980
J.
E.
N.
O.
There's not two ads.

590
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:24.550
How do you spell her?
Hey,
how do I spell your name again?
A m.

591
00:37:24.551 --> 00:37:28.510
Y.
A Mi.
If she has an easy fucking name,
it's going to,
you know,

592
00:37:28.511 --> 00:37:30.190
in a regular Naf last name.

593
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:35.330
You Know Amy Clark Clark would have the,

594
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.630
and there's another one.
Ask her for her email address.
Um,

595
00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.060
signed back up for Facebook.
That's what I said.

596
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.840
Wait til she texts you and say,

597
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:52.850
I lost all my numbers.
Who is this?
Oh,

598
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.040
that has potential.
Ask her straight up.

599
00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:04.960
Straight up now to ask her straight up and tell her that her name never mattered

600
00:38:04.961 --> 00:38:09.961
because it was his soul and that he was in love with her soul is what you should

601
00:38:12.421 --> 00:38:16.500
say
it straight up.

602
00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:20.610
And tell her her name never mattered because it was her soul that I can feel

603
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:23.970
every woman listening to this cringing on that one.
That's like a,

604
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.050
a somebody,
you know,

605
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.980
must have taken the stars out of the skies and put them in your fucking eyeballs

606
00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:36.260
because a,
I'm seeing the big dip up.
Whatever the fuck you say.

607
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.210
What are those dumb lines?

608
00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.450
<v 0>Uh Huh.</v>

609
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.620
<v 1>Those stupid fucking one liners that never work.</v>

610
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:52.170
Hey,
did you ever go to the Grand Canyon because your cleavage is fucking off the

611
00:38:52.171 --> 00:38:54.450
hook with the stars in your eyes.

612
00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:02.120
I can never remember shit like that.
Like I can never remember street jokes.

613
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.690
I always laugh my ass off to guys go on a barn.

614
00:39:05.691 --> 00:39:08.310
I can never fucking remember it the same way.
I can't remember.

615
00:39:08.311 --> 00:39:10.520
It has gotta be one of those one line as I can remember.

616
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:12.563
<v 0>MMM.</v>

617
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:18.460
<v 1>Hey,
you haven't must be missing an angel cause uh,</v>

618
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.460
so I'd like to fuck the hell out of you.
I'm sorry.

619
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.440
I don't know how they go.
I don't fucking,
I don't remember.
Hey,
you know what,

620
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.530
I'm looking at you and I,
I,
I dunno.

621
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.950
I like you and I,
I want to be on you.

622
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.660
I want to be on you.

623
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.210
<v 0>Okay?</v>

624
00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:44.550
<v 1>The fuck would I say to a woman I've been fucking tied up for so goddamn long.</v>

625
00:39:44.551 --> 00:39:48.850
What in God's name would I say to a woman if I walked into a bar?
Hey look,

626
00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:52.180
I know I'm old.
I know I've talked to stop walking away.

627
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.820
I just say it in a nicer way.
Hey,
how you doing,
sweetie?

628
00:39:58.821 --> 00:40:00.710
Do you have a,
you wouldn't happen to have dad issues.

629
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:11.680
I want to do this.
This is a good youtube video.
The worst fuck it pickup lines.

630
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.330
You could come up with it.

631
00:40:13.331 --> 00:40:17.590
You just have a fuck and you make yourself up and you just hit on women in the

632
00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:19.840
worst fucking way,
you know?

633
00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.300
And you want a friend of yours and then you have like a point.

634
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:24.640
You have a point system.
All right?

635
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:26.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

636
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.710
<v 1>Okay.
If they get up and walk away,
that's one point.</v>

637
00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:33.460
Whoever gets the most points wins.
All right?
And the whole thing is to be funny.

638
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:37.840
You're not actually trying to pick them up.
All right,
so is the gate all right?

639
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:41.590
If they get up and walk away,
that's one point.

640
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.030
If they throw a drink in your face,
that's too,
if they slap you,

641
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.730
that's for
now.
That's three or whatever.

642
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:55.330
Here's the point system.
I mean you should get a roll of the eyes.

643
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.670
Maybe roll of the eyes is one point.

644
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.850
<v 0>All right.
Um,</v>

645
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:07.950
<v 1>if she does like that fucking like get it done,</v>

646
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.600
whatever the fuck they say when they make that face in their mouth gets shaped

647
00:41:11.601 --> 00:41:16.190
all weird.
Like,
like they're going to get,
when they make that fucking look,

648
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.910
we'll say,
maybe that's worth a full point,
right?

649
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.900
And then however you will have it is fuck you want to work it all right?

650
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.750
And then you get enough via doing it and then draft kings.com we'll fucking let

651
00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.690
get bet on it.
All right.

652
00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:34.790
Pick 10 knuckleheads without going the salary cap.
Right.

653
00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:38.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

654
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.290
<v 1>Somebody last week,
one $30.
Um,</v>

655
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:46.990
I can't tell you that.
That is a fun thing to fucking do.

656
00:41:46.991 --> 00:41:49.800
We used to do that shit back in the day when we would just walk up and like,

657
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:54.010
it was almost like this weird thing.
It was sort of a defeatist thing,

658
00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:58.990
but in a way it got you to get over your fear of approaching women.

659
00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:00.190
And a,

660
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.580
the key is to just go up to women you don't give a shit about and just do that

661
00:42:03.581 --> 00:42:06.730
and just practice,
just getting over,

662
00:42:06.731 --> 00:42:11.110
like feeling stupid and just say stupid shit.
Oh my God.

663
00:42:11.111 --> 00:42:13.900
We used to do that down in daisy Buchanan is back in the day.

664
00:42:13.901 --> 00:42:18.460
What the fuck were we doing down there?
No one in the,
one night we hung out.

665
00:42:18.461 --> 00:42:22.330
Right.
Um,
this guy came in,

666
00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:27.280
Johnny Hickey who made this movie called oxymorons that you should check it out

667
00:42:27.281 --> 00:42:31.240
on Netflix.
Matt's really good fucking underground movie that a lot of people,
uh,

668
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.000
you know,
don't know about.
And a comedian,

669
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.020
I know a patty Ross fucking crushed it in that movie.

670
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.540
But he came by and um,
so we,
we hung out with him that night.

671
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.210
We went to one of those fucking meat market dance clubs.
Right.
Just hilarious.

672
00:42:46.211 --> 00:42:48.230
It was a bunch of fucking old guys.
We were all laughing.

673
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.990
They stuck us in this VIP room and uh,
it was in the back,
totally secluded.

674
00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.380
There's all these gorgeous young women and fucking people,
good looking guys,

675
00:42:56.381 --> 00:42:57.201
all dancing and shit.

676
00:42:57.201 --> 00:43:01.570
And we go through this rat maze to go to this VIP area of where God knows how

677
00:43:01.571 --> 00:43:06.340
many fucking orgies ever happened.
And we're just sitting in there,
you know,

678
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.980
three married guys,
two guys in like a Aa.
So the ladies come in,
right?

679
00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.040
The fucking waitresses,
you know,
dressed all hot.

680
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.730
Then they'd look in as they come in,
like,
Hey,
I'm looking at us.

681
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.770
And I think one of us ordered a seven up

682
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.560
by the end.
One of them was just sitting down talking to us about comedy.

683
00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.110
It was fucking pathetic.
But anyways,

684
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:37.120
first he had left his phone over at the Wilbur theater and they had locked the

685
00:43:37.121 --> 00:43:40.570
place up.
So I called one of the guys in.
Fortunately,

686
00:43:40.571 --> 00:43:43.570
he was still in there settling up some shit.
So I ran over there to help them.

687
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.490
<v 3>Okay.</v>

688
00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.270
<v 1>And as we're walking back to the club,
I was going,
Jesus Christ,</v>

689
00:43:49.271 --> 00:43:51.190
for as he look at these women here,
my God,

690
00:43:51.191 --> 00:43:53.680
I don't remember Boston having as many good looking women,
right?

691
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:58.930
Fucking thick thighs.
Clydesdales walking down the street,
just crushing it,
right?

692
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.550
And I says,
I sent it to verse,
we were walking into the club and these,

693
00:44:02.551 --> 00:44:06.220
these two girls sitting on a curb crying,
he goes,
yeah,
that beautiful.
He goes,

694
00:44:06.730 --> 00:44:10.420
you know,
most of them are,
most of them are crying.
And I go,

695
00:44:10.421 --> 00:44:14.530
that's because they're trying to find love and these clubs fucking dopes.
Right?

696
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.510
And we just started fucking dying laughing because you looking around and all of

697
00:44:19.511 --> 00:44:23.650
these,
uh,
the type of guys that go in there,
you know what I mean?

698
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.770
Those guys who actually take selfies.

699
00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.170
And actually I take selfies in front of sports things,
but you know,

700
00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:32.340
the duck lip guys and who do the fucking peace side,
you know what I mean?

701
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.580
And get their eyebrows shape.
What,
what are you,
what are you going in there for?

702
00:44:35.581 --> 00:44:40.050
Like you,
you're gonna find you're gonna find a meaningful relationship.
Yeah.

703
00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:41.490
You're not gonna find anybody in there.

704
00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:45.330
You got to get to join like a fucking like volleyball,

705
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.900
volleyball or softball league.
You know?

706
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:53.310
That's where you're going to find a good guy.
Right?
Granted,

707
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.740
it's probably gonna have some,
some sort of a drinking problem.
I actually,

708
00:44:55.741 --> 00:44:59.040
you know what?
I don't know that I'd go to a softball league to meet a guy.

709
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.120
I do that to meet a woman.

710
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:03.630
Like if a woman was playing like softball or some shit,
you know what I mean?

711
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:08.230
Jesus.
I just pictured some girl just fucking grunting.
When she throw raw,

712
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:11.520
it's just making the throw from third.
I have the worst ideas.

713
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:14.340
Don't fucking listen to me,
whatever,
but I can tell you right now,

714
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:18.240
you're not going to find your way for husband and one of those fucking,
uh,

715
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.870
dance clubs.
Are you?
Yeah.
If you're going to tab in your shoes off,

716
00:45:21.871 --> 00:45:25.080
crying in the gutter and you need,
deserve it,
enough,
deserve it.

717
00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:27.330
Unless you keep going back and forth trying to find it.
All right.

718
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:30.390
Let me read a couple of these fucking things here.

I did mention in that I believe,
oh,

769
00:48:45.841 --> 00:48:48.310
I don't believe that.
Um,

770
00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:54.240
I did mention at one point that the um,
uh,
shit,

771
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.060
what the fuck went?
Oh yeah,
that'd been going out after every show.
You know,

772
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.520
signing the posters and shaking hands and everything and I,

773
00:48:59.521 --> 00:49:02.970
everybody's been fucking great.
I do have to tell you though,
this,

774
00:49:02.971 --> 00:49:06.480
some people out there that don't know how to shake a hand and I'm not talking

775
00:49:06.481 --> 00:49:10.080
about the lip lymph,
the dead fish handshake.

776
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.510
I'm not talking about the lobster claw.

777
00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:15.690
Like you're helping me out of a carriage on prom night.

778
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.370
I'm not talking about either one of those.

779
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.620
I'm talking about the guy when he goes to shake hands,

780
00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.940
he fucking brings his hand way out to his side,

781
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:29.520
pauses and then just fucking like 90 miles an hour.
Grabs your hand,

782
00:49:29.521 --> 00:49:31.710
almost like fucking rip show Rahmati is socket.

783
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.360
It's like the fucking handshake version of Charles Barkley's golf swing where it

784
00:49:36.361 --> 00:49:41.040
goes up to the top and it stops for a second and then fucking follows through

785
00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.110
the every show.

786
00:49:43.111 --> 00:49:47.130
There's like one guy who does that and I'm hoping I'm talking to somebody right

787
00:49:47.131 --> 00:49:49.770
now who does that.
Don't do that.

788
00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:55.230
You shake somebody's hand,
you look them in the eye,
you reach out.
Okay,

789
00:49:55.590 --> 00:50:00.270
point a to point B,
farm handshake and then you let go.

790
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.300
That's it.
You know,
bring your fucking handout.
It tried to fucking gang,

791
00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:09.360
grab it and then grab it at a weird fucking angle and then pull it towards you

792
00:50:09.421 --> 00:50:12.030
as you shake it.
You're fucking dope.
I swear to God,

793
00:50:12.031 --> 00:50:15.450
I'm going to say something tonight.
If somebody does that to be like,
dude,
who,

794
00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.360
what?
What is,
what is your like fucking

795
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.880
that's like those guys that just,
they can't handle like a like,

796
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:25.640
oh I'm going to touch another guy.
Oh I got to get all tensed up,

797
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:31.350
can yank in the goddamn thing.
Drives me up the fucking wall.

798
00:50:31.351 --> 00:50:35.030
And I actually debated
bringing that up to you and a guys,

799
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.120
cause God knows somebody who's going to do it on purpose.
I think they're funny.

800
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:42.740
Oh,
I'm trolling you whenever the fuck these fucking kids do nowadays,
uh,

801
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:45.110
whatever it is worth it.
If I can just get one person

802
00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.390
to just stop doing that,
just fucking relax.

803
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.270
Point A to point B from handshake.
You let go.
And it's over.
All right.

804
00:50:55.330 --> 00:51:00.240
There you go.
You can try and get your business off the ground,
walking around,

805
00:51:00.241 --> 00:51:02.340
fucking yanking people's arms out of their sockets.

806
00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.350
Like Jam Band Guy Did to that fucking love dude on,
on the,
on the uh,

807
00:51:07.351 --> 00:51:09.240
the Cavaliers.
By the way.

808
00:51:09.241 --> 00:51:11.820
I think the Cavaliers are going to win the championship and I can say that,

809
00:51:11.821 --> 00:51:13.650
cause I've sorta overheard what's been going on.

810
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.240
Now I'm picking the Cavaliers to win the NBA Championship and I'm picking the

811
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.130
ducks to win the Stanley Cup.

812
00:51:20.131 --> 00:51:24.660
But I can say that having spent the last fucking 10 days underground on the

813
00:51:24.661 --> 00:51:29.460
ground as far as being a sports fan,
I haven't watched any games.
I got nothing.

814
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.730
I got nothing.
You know,
I'm,
I'm working the entire time.

815
00:51:32.731 --> 00:51:35.460
The Games are on the early games,
in late games.

816
00:51:35.461 --> 00:51:37.260
And then at night when I come home,

817
00:51:37.261 --> 00:51:40.680
my parents are asleep in front of the TV watching Fox News.

818
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

819
00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:46.350
<v 1>Um,
so you know,
there you go.
Um,
Oh hey,</v>

820
00:51:46.351 --> 00:51:49.350
did anybody see that fucking in Waco,
Texas,

821
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:51.870
those rival bike gigs,

822
00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:56.130
like some 20 on 20 gun fight in like nine guys died.

823
00:51:56.131 --> 00:51:58.890
And it was all these innocent people around there.
I got to tell you,

824
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.480
I got to admit something as a white guy,

825
00:52:00.481 --> 00:52:04.830
when I saw the picture afterwards of how they had them all rounded up and the

826
00:52:04.831 --> 00:52:07.920
cops were standing there with their backs to him.
Finally,
Swami,
he said like,

827
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:13.780
I hope I can find it on Facebook was just talking about how,

828
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.610
because they're white.
They just had them sitting there,
these people in,

829
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:18.700
and then it was one of those things,

830
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.420
I don't give a fuck how much of a Douche you are.
You have to agree with it.

831
00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:26.920
It was fucking ridiculous.
These guys just had a 20 on 20 fucking gun battle.

832
00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:28.580
<v 0>Okay,</v>

833
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:29.950
<v 1>all right.
In a God damn.</v>

834
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:31.800
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

835
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:36.030
<v 1>the fucking mall area.
When a restaurant,
there's all these innocent people,</v>

836
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.200
right,
and what do they do?
They just have them sitting there doing,

837
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:42.000
a couple of them were sitting there on this smart phones texting.

838
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:46.540
There was all these stab stabbings and all kinds of shit that happens.
Shut.

839
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:50.610
Do those who fucking black guys forget it.
It probably would've shut all of them,

840
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:54.300
or at least most of them got to admit man and was,
it was pretty fucked up.

841
00:52:54.301 --> 00:52:56.940
Somebody wrote something,
you know,
they're cops,
they're white.

842
00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:02.280
Those are their fucking police force.
They're fine.
And uh,
I dunno,

843
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:03.420
I don't think as a white dude,

844
00:53:03.421 --> 00:53:05.640
I could fucking argue that God knows I'm argumentative,

845
00:53:05.641 --> 00:53:09.630
but it was pretty fucking ridiculous that you could shoot up a damn restaurant.

846
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.290
Nine people die and then afterwards you guys are all huddled in a corner just

847
00:53:13.291 --> 00:53:15.060
sort of sitting there,
you know,

848
00:53:15.061 --> 00:53:17.760
looking like you're waiting for a bus to take you back to your fourth,

849
00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.580
whatever you're doing,
you're a biker gang.
Um,

850
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:24.980
I don't know if anybody can find that.
I would love to retweet it.
I,

851
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.230
I'm one of those old guy is how old I am.
Actually.
I love Facebook.

852
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.720
I fucking love it,
man.
I love that.

853
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:33.900
They just skimmed the fucking news for me and I don't have to try and find it.

854
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.460
I liked that young people hate it.
Like,
boom,
it good.
You still on Facebook?
Yes,

855
00:53:38.461 --> 00:53:42.180
I am.
Please.
You and your DJ music goes somewhere else.
I love that.

856
00:53:42.181 --> 00:53:46.050
I ruined your fund here by being the old guy on it.
Where the fuck is it?

857
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:51.480
Scrolling up.
This is the only thing.
He can't find it after a while,
you know?
Um,

858
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.340
what the fuck is this?
Some asleep Nate laying next to a python.

859
00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.893
<v 0>MMM,</v>

860
00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:03.780
<v 1>hang on.
Hang on,
hang on,
hang on.</v>

861
00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

862
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:08.100
<v 1>Uh,
fuck.
I can't find it.
When are you going to do and I'm gonna fucking</v>

863
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:14.700
Goddamn fucking cold now.
God Damn it bill,
but a dope.
Alright,

864
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.380
let's just read these things here for the rest of the rest of our time here on

865
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:23.910
the podcast.
All right,
back breaking jobs,
back breaking jobs.

866
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.840
A bill.
I didn't get a chance to listen to Thursday's full plot podcasts,

867
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:31.770
but in the beginning I heard you ask,
are there any backbreaking jobs left?

868
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.920
Sing as you live in southern California and fly helicopters.

869
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:39.000
I thought you might be interested in learning about hot shot crews if you

870
00:54:39.001 --> 00:54:41.020
weren't familiar with them.
Uh,

871
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:46.130
they were formed in southern California in the 1940s to fight wildfires.

872
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.130
That job was about is backbreaking as it gets.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

873
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:54.630
I've seen that on the phone.
I've seen that on a new,
seen it on the news,

874
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.960
um,
where they,
uh,

875
00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:00.580
you know,

876
00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:05.580
they got like the full fucking fireman outfit on and they're just marching up a

877
00:55:06.431 --> 00:55:10.570
hill with a fire hose.
Like it's nothing like it's nothing.

878
00:55:10.571 --> 00:55:13.840
And then they start a fire around where they're at to establish a perimeter.

879
00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.230
Yeah.
You know,
I actually,
I knew there was backbreaking jobs,

880
00:55:17.231 --> 00:55:20.260
I just couldn't think of any.
So now we're going to learn about some,
uh,
he goes,

881
00:55:20.261 --> 00:55:21.670
I'm not gonna explain it in detail,

882
00:55:21.671 --> 00:55:26.671
but hot shots or some gnarly people and they put out the majority of large fires

883
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.670
in the western United States.
It's a really cool,

884
00:55:30.671 --> 00:55:33.630
unique old school job.
Um,

885
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:37.900
I did it for many years based out of northern California and had a blast,

886
00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:42.190
but it was so fucking hard and it,
it trashed my body.

887
00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.510
I'm still fighting fires,

888
00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:46.150
but I ain't fucking with the hot shot lifestyle anymore.

889
00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.750
I don't think there were many jobs in United States involving more intense

890
00:55:49.751 --> 00:55:53.410
manual labor.
Then fighting fire on a hot shot crew.

891
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:58.090
You should check out smoke jumpers to another really cool backbreaking job.

892
00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:58.841
Uh,

893
00:55:58.841 --> 00:56:02.650
there's some real cool videos and information online about what those folks do.

894
00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.670
If you get time to look it up,
I think you'll dig it.
Um,
Jesus Christ,
dude,

895
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.370
you're supposed to do that for me.

896
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:12.910
You just got everybody all fucking interest in now.
You gave him homework.

897
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:17.320
He gave me homework.
All right,
I'll fucking line.
Yeah,
I'll say I'll look it up.

898
00:56:17.321 --> 00:56:20.770
That all depends.
If I even remember,
uh,
he says,
shit,
Bro.

899
00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:25.080
Get your pilot's license and maybe someday you'll be buckets of water on fires

900
00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:28.880
for some hot shots.
A smoke jumpers.
Thanks Billy.
And Go fuck is,
ah,

901
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:33.390
fuck Tom Brady's balls.
He said,
dude,
there's no fucking way I would do that.

902
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:34.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

903
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:38.140
<v 1>I'm a weekend warrior.
I'm going to go flying into smoking shit.</v>

904
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:44.230
Get all freaked out,
you know,
spatial,
disoriented,
whatever the fuck it is.

905
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:48.520
I can't see the horizon,
um,
from a lady

906
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.550
from a lady bill.
I love your stuff.
Uh,

907
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:59.551
but were you this angry over that dog murdering psycho Vick being allowed back

908
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:03.860
in the NFL?
Um,

909
00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:07.970
no,
because he fucking spent two years in Leavenworth prison,

910
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.580
you know,
uh,
Brady's suspension is certainly one of the organizations,

911
00:57:14.581 --> 00:57:19.410
lesser offenses.
What do you mean the Patriots?

912
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:24.380
What else do we have?
What else?
Suspension.

913
00:57:24.381 --> 00:57:29.381
Do we have spy gate 15 fucking years ago.

914
00:57:29.541 --> 00:57:31.130
What do we have before that?
We got nothing.

915
00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:34.910
We got one fucking suspension in a 50 years of a franchise.

916
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.040
Jesus fucking Christ.
Will you this angry over that dog murdering cycle?
Yeah.

917
00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:45.110
I have a pit bull.
What the fuck do you think?
I thought it was disgusting.

918
00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:50.120
And then they gave him two years.
11 worth 11 words.
Fucking prison.

919
00:57:50.121 --> 00:57:54.440
There's murderers and rapists in there.
The guy's career.
He was never the same.

920
00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:57.980
Never came back as a foe.
A healthy start or anything.

921
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:02.480
It completely fucked his whole life up.
What else?
More.
What else?

922
00:58:02.481 --> 00:58:04.340
More did you want done to Michael Vick?

923
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.013
<v 0>Okay,</v>

924
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:08.110
<v 1>well that was an easy one.</v>

925
00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:10.950
<v 0>Okay.</v>

926
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:13.800
<v 1>No,
I was,
I was absolutely thrilled.
I wasn't upset.
I was,</v>

927
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:18.270
I wasn't angry at Michael.
Victor was like,
I was,
I was sick over it.

928
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:19.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

929
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:24.160
<v 1>I was sick.
Fucking confused how anybody could fucking do that.</v>

930
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:27.690
And then,
you know,
I don't know,

931
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.060
two years sitting in a fucking jail cell.
Leavenworth prison.
Yeah.
I mean,

932
00:58:33.061 --> 00:58:36.180
I would say that he paid the fucking price,
you know,

933
00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:40.930
that's gonna follow him for the rest of his fucking life.
And you know,

934
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:45.420
I mean,
I don't what,
what else did you want done to the guy?

935
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.610
I know you're one of those psycho dog lovers,
right?

936
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.580
Fucking drown him and shoot him in the fucking head.
You know,

937
00:58:50.581 --> 00:58:54.150
one of those people.
All Right,
dad is a junk food addict.

938
00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:56.280
I hate that by the way.

939
00:58:56.281 --> 00:58:58.950
Like when you fucking flip out over some fucking bullshit like that and this

940
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.680
when he's going to bring up something else,
you know?
Well,

941
00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:05.310
what about the fucking moon coming closer to the earth?

942
00:59:05.311 --> 00:59:08.280
Isn't that more important?
It's like,
yeah,
but you know,

943
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:10.800
we weren't talking about that.
Where are we?
Well,
actually,
no,

944
00:59:10.801 --> 00:59:13.560
that's a bad example because that would be fucking something in the present if

945
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:17.160
that was actually happening.
Right.
This was something that happened.

946
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.580
The guy got caught,
he went to jail,
he lost,

947
00:59:20.581 --> 00:59:24.040
he lost career and spent two years in Leavenworth prison.
I thought it was done.

948
00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.770
I am one of those people though after that.

949
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:28.720
And he went to jail for two fucking years.

950
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:31.870
I am one of those peoples that dance goes all right,
you paid the price.

951
00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:36.490
I'm not one of those guys who just goes,
fuck you for fucking ever.
You know,

952
00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.390
you know these people who you want to solve shit,

953
00:59:40.391 --> 00:59:43.420
but they punish people and then they never take them off punishment and never

954
00:59:43.421 --> 00:59:47.440
give him a chance to fucking try to put their life back together.
Um,
all right,

955
00:59:47.441 --> 00:59:50.740
dad is a junk food addict.
All right.
Hey,

956
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:55.480
Billie Barry balls,
um,
every week on the podcast.

957
00:59:55.481 --> 01:00:00.400
So he would talk about the salt sugar fat cycle is as addictive as any drug and

958
01:00:00.401 --> 01:00:04.990
I 100% agree.
Um,
I don't know if it's as addictive as heroin.
Obviously,

959
01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:08.710
God knows I didn't do a study,
but I know it's,
it's the same kind of thing.

960
01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:11.320
He goes,
I'm trying to make,
um,

961
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.950
I'm trying to make a,
what am I,

962
01:00:14.951 --> 01:00:18.370
where am I trying to make good dietary decisions in my own life,

963
01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.920
but I'm worried about my dad.
Every time I visited home,

964
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:24.160
I seem plowing through shells of Oreos,
steaks,
pasta,

965
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.050
and an unthinkable amount of soda.

966
01:00:26.051 --> 01:00:29.620
He's in his sixties type one diabetic and overweight,

967
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.630
yet he does nothing to improve his died.

968
01:00:31.631 --> 01:00:34.990
Every time I tried to get him to eat something healthy or even keep the lettuce

969
01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:36.370
and tomato on the cheeseburger,

970
01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:40.270
he gives me a response you'd expect from an alcoholic who's been cut off from

971
01:00:40.271 --> 01:00:44.380
the bar.
He goes,
I've tried to eat healthy.

972
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:50.490
Oh,
Jesus Christ,
my brothers fucking over here,
practice in his clarinet.
I,

973
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.230
I'm fucking from the most crazy family over.

974
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.480
He gives me a response.

975
01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.870
You expect from an alcoholic who's been cut off at the bar.

976
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:03.890
I've tried to eat healthy in front of him.
I've voiced my concerns.

977
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.390
I've even made fun of him,
but eventually he eats what he wants.

978
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:13.280
He's the guy who raised as a girl,
raised me,
and he's playing for the end.

979
01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:15.740
He's paying for the groceries.
So it's hard to sway him,

980
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:18.170
especially when he's so stuck in his ways.

981
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:23.360
What can I do to get them to eat healthy once in a while?
Uh,
Jesus,
I dunno.

982
01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:26.930
I Dunno what to tell you.
That's a diff,
let me shut the door here.

983
01:01:26.931 --> 01:01:29.700
When my brother plays the horn here.
Hang on a sec.

984
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:32.683
<v 0>Right?</v>

985
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.870
<v 1>Unbelievable.
That's the family I come from though.
You know,</v>

986
01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.540
and he's a fucking sick ass guitar player.

987
01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:43.700
And then you just got to move on to the next thing.
All right,

988
01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:48.110
now I'm going to fucking go after the clarinet.
I don't hate,
you know,

989
01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.490
it's your fucking life.
Whatever you want to do.
Um,
what was the question?

990
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.770
Um,
what can I do to get them to eat healthy once in a while?
Write him a letter.

991
01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:02.780
All right.
I think he's,
he's one of those guys.
You can't come at them like that.

992
01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:04.250
Just tell talent,
you know,

993
01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:07.700
give us some stats and just tell him he's going to fucking die and you don't

994
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:11.420
want them to die because you love him.
I would do that,
you know,

995
01:02:11.421 --> 01:02:12.800
and then it's up to him.
Okay.

996
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:16.100
And then you can feel good if something bad happens that you actually,

997
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.440
you know,
yeah.

998
01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:24.780
Do you fucking tried tried to get him to go for walks or something cause that's

999
01:02:25.211 --> 01:02:28.990
not gonna end.
Well man,
I,
I had a friend who was a diabetic and he's no longer,

1000
01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.960
he's no longer around man.
It's a fucking brutal thing.
But uh,

1001
01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:36.760
yeah,
it's hard to help someone that doesn't want to help themselves.
So I,

1002
01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:37.970
whenever I'm,
you know,

1003
01:02:37.971 --> 01:02:40.890
I've had people like that in my life and I always went with the letter and now

1004
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:45.891
he's found the letter was a great way because they can read it when they want to

1005
01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:49.970
sit down and read it.
They're by themselves.
They're not,

1006
01:02:49.971 --> 01:02:51.740
you're not looking at them when they're doing it.

1007
01:02:51.741 --> 01:02:55.010
So they can actually maybe have their guard down a little bit and take it in.

1008
01:02:55.011 --> 01:02:56.090
Because it sounds like,
you know,

1009
01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.850
your dad is defensive or he's set in his ways and all of that shit.

1010
01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:06.670
And um,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

1011
01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.970
Um,
that's fucking statutes.
It's,
it sucks.

1012
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:14.990
It definitely just,
that's a very difficult thing to deal.
You know,

1013
01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:18.440
I've had people have problems with boots.
I should fucking talk 10 day,

1014
01:03:18.441 --> 01:03:22.820
God Damn Bender.
Right.
Um,
but uh,

1015
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.680
<v 0>okay.</v>

1016
01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.690
<v 1>Yeah,
I go with the letter man.</v>

1017
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.380
I go with the letter and good luck to you because they got to be receptive to
it.

1018
01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.820
Um,
you know,
fuck,

1019
01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:39.020
what are you going to do?
Yeah.
That brings back some bad memories.
Um,
all right,

1020
01:03:39.021 --> 01:03:41.870
let's end on a positive note though.
Uh,
I just got to,

1021
01:03:41.871 --> 01:03:43.670
I just got a tweet from the one man thrill ride.

1022
01:03:43.671 --> 01:03:47.200
We got a picture back in the dressing room and this fucking guy's hilarious.
Um,

1023
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:49.020
<v 0>okay.</v>

1024
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.680
<v 1>What did she say?
Awesome mean bill burr last night,
new material was gold.</v>

1025
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.560
Joe Barr,
Nick Paul Versey crushed it to great night.
Yeah,
man,

1026
01:03:55.561 --> 01:03:58.340
it was a fucking sick night.
Sick night here.
And before,
you know,

1027
01:03:58.341 --> 01:03:59.300
it was next time I talked,

1028
01:03:59.301 --> 01:04:02.460
this run's going to be over and I'll have a cold and who,
you know what?

1029
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:05.580
It was fucking worth it.
I want to thank everybody who's come out to the shows.

1030
01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:07.910
Everybody bought the posters,
even came by and said hello.

1031
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.470
Even those people don't know how to shake hands.
Thank you for coming out.

1032
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:15.390
I don't think I'll ever do this again.
Um,
you know,

1033
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:19.020
19 shows at one fucking place.
It was a hell of a run.
I did it.

1034
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:21.090
And if somebody breaks the record,
God bless you.

1035
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.050
It's all for you and you know it's yours.
Do

1036
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:29.380
I don't want it.
I don't want to try to come back.
Thanks again to,

1037
01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:31.090

Uh,

1038
01:04:31.091 --> 01:04:35.350
Jessie's custom design.com for that unbelievable goalie masks that you made for

1039
01:04:35.351 --> 01:04:38.310

Thank you Jessie.
I swear to God,
I don't have that thing forever.

1040
01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:42.160
They'll just go right write my office and the most prominent place I can find.

1041
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:46.030
And uh,
thanks to the thrill ride for coming down.

1042
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:50.080
A good luck with your big audition coming up.
I know you're going to crush it.

1043
01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:54.310
And,
um,
good luck to raw Roger Goodell.
You know,

1044
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.550
I know he's got a tough case coming up where he's on one side of it and he's

1045
01:04:57.551 --> 01:05:01.480
judging it.
A good luck to you,
Roger.
I hope you were able to somehow,
you know,

1046
01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.460
really bring the hammer down,
you know,

1047
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:07.330
really bring the hammer down to two gangs for fucking knocking out your fiance

1048
01:05:07.331 --> 01:05:09.490
and a in an elevator,
but for games,

1049
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:14.060
for letting a cunt hair of air out of a ball and a 38 point loss.

1050
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:16.290
You know,

1051
01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:19.960
why don't you look at ESPN study where they show it was a disadvantage for fuck

1052
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:24.280
sakes.
Whatever.
What are you going to do?
All right,
that's it.

1053
01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:29.140
You know,
not to say that what Michael did was Vic did with lether.

1054
01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.750
Uh,
go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you on Thursday when I'm just checking.
