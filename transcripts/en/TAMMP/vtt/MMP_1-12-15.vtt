1
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.780
Hey,
what's going on is bill burr.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.560
And this is the Monday morning podcast for a Monday,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.630
January 12th.
I'm going to guess no,
it's not January 12th to fuck.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.050
Well wait a minute.
The 17th is Saturday.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.280
Fridays is 16 1514 1312.
Yeah,

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.690
it's the fucking 12th.
I'm on the road and uh,

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.840
I got to keep my voice down here cause I'm in the fucking hotel room and I don't

8
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:32.841
feel like is it always happens whenever I do a podcast in the,

9
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:36.360
uh,
the hotel room is somebody eventually knocks on the door cause I'm screaming

10
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.910
cunt too loud.
You know,

11
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.300
if I was screaming bastard,
that would be fine.
Okay.
But if I screamed con,

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.000
then all of a sudden they start thinking about NFL players in their bottom lips

13
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.850
quivering and they realized that they got to get it right.

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.300
Got To get it right it right.

15
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.770
And then they come up here and then I have a fucking problem.
Um,
so anyways,

16
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.840
this is going to be my tone for the fucking week.
Um,

17
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.570
I'm in New Orleans.
Do you know what it means to Miss New Orleans?

18
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:13.890
That's where my baby go hose.
Um,

19
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.170
get an acting gig out here for a couple of days,
a couple of days.
And uh,

20
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:22.020
yeah,
that's it.
Anyways.
Um,

21
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.960
do you guys watch the football this weekend?
Huh?

22
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.150
How exciting was the God damn football,

23
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.570
this fucking city?
It's so fucking shady,
man.
I love it,
but it's fucking shady.

24
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.131
I know.

25
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:39.260
We've been in a city where you feel like it's Christmas and you could get your

26
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:41.750
fucking throat slit at any second.
I mean,
that is,

27
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.420
that is New Orleans in a nutshell.

28
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.320
That and there's not a vegetable to be found in this city.

29
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.660
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
uh,
let's go with the f the,</v>

31
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.810
the first thing first,
the,
uh,

32
00:01:55.811 --> 00:02:00.730
the packer's cowboys game.
All right.

33
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.570
I get it.
Like the fact that that isn't ruled a fucking catch,

34
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.010
and I know everybody's sick of it at this point,

35
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:13.011
but I don't give a fuck if I saw one more nerd who looked like he could even

36
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.630
catch a fucking beach ball.
Underhanded.

37
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.700
<v 1>In a fucking playroom.</v>

39
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.230
Explained to me why watching Dez Bryant catch that ball.
And then you have,

40
00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:26.380
it's said it wasn't a catch out.
I was going to fucking throw the TV out.

41
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:29.590
The why I wasn't gonna do that.
Come on,
I get sued.

42
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.360
You know I'm not that Kinda Guy,
but
it's fucking unbelievable.

43
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.430
The Guy,
this is what kills me about that fucking rule.
Dez goes up,

44
00:02:39.431 --> 00:02:40.540
catches the ball,

45
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.820
runs three steps and then because he's so fucking athletic,

46
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:50.620
he can,
he's got giant hands.
He can hold the ball in one hand against his wrist.

47
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.241
As he goes down,

48
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:55.630
he has the presence of mind to try to get it as close as he can to the goal line

49
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.930
and hits the ground,
pops out and then they go.

50
00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:01.880
It's not a catch in every fucking thing about him.

51
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:06.740
Catching the ball is not admissible under the rule.
He goes up,
catches the ball,

52
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.840
not admissible,
moves it from one hand to another.
Not Admissible.

53
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.770
As far as control runs three steps.
She can't count the steps.

54
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.520
It was like some boss Hog Shit,
right then fucking extends his arm.

55
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.560
He did an extended far enough.

56
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.760
<v 1>And then he fucking,
it hits the ground and pop sal the ad no catch.</v>

58
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.810
I'm trying to wrap my head around that fucking rule that all of that,

59
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.040
all of Dez Bryant catching that football is not admissible

60
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.020
because I don't know,
maybe,

61
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.680
maybe the rule is a good rule because as I was saying,

62
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.340
they want a clear cut definition of what is a catch you but isn't a catch.

63
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.190
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.430
<v 1>I love that the ref thought it was a catch and then then disposed to be like</v>

65
00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:00.620
irrefutable evidence to like,

66
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.860
I'm just going to say the word evidence evidence that that uh,

67
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.510
I just,
I just fucking blew my mind like

68
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.450
<v 0>yeah,</v>

69
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.220
<v 1>when they caught the ball,
if they gave it to them,</v>

70
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.060
let's just say the cowboys punch it in then then they will up what,
three,
four,

71
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:18.610
whatever and then you get the excitement of the package,

72
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:22.150
get the ball back and Aaron Rodgers and they got two minutes.

73
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:26.680
You've got this unbelievable end to the game as opposed to where,
wow.

74
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.240
Oh we're sorry.
What you just saw happen.
Didn't really happen.
Fuck it.
That is,

75
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.680
I got to tell you,
that is the worst.

76
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.650
<v 0>Okay?</v>

77
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.490
<v 1>I can't say it's the word,</v>

78
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:41.080
like the Tuck rule is the worst fucking rule I ever seen in my line.

79
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.300
This is coming from a patriots fan.

80
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.240
The tuck rule is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.

81
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.470
There was never a problem with the help thing.
You know,
90% of the time,

82
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.180
even before instant replay,
was his arm going back or was it going forward?

83
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:57.840
And that was either,
you know,
incomplete pass or a fumble,

84
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.280
that whole thing that it,

85
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:02.580
but if they get then tuck it against you like a little fucking loaf of bread,

86
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.370
that that becomes water.
An incomplete pass.

87
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:08.800
The dumbest fucking rule I've ever seen him in the life.

88
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:12.800
And before you rate a fans feel vindicated that I'm saying this.
No,

89
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.530
that you have a super bowl trophy and I've,

90
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:20.280
I remind you this because you guys are so busy dressing up like fucking Alison

91
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.360
wonderland before you go to the game.
All right?

92
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:29.361
You're a bunch of theater majors that you forget that Superbowl 11 you won that

93
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.450
on a horrific roughing the passer call that put the ball all the way down on the

94
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:38.290
one yard line.
Okay.
Against the New England patriots.

95
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.970
So it evened out.
Okay.
Eight even though,
right?

96
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.120
So we have one that we shouldn't have and you have one that you shouldn't have.

97
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:51.100
So we're fucking even,
but Jesus Christ and my page has had the biggest fucking,

98
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:55.420
whenever I can't get over the fact that they fucked me as a fan and said that

99
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:59.310
that wasn't a catch and a and exciting end of that game.
And instead

100
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.780
see how he long however long look,
look pissed.
It was like as a fucking catch.

101
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:08.840
Exactly.
It is a fucking catch.
But now with these new nerd rules,

102
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.320
you can't count the steps why

103
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.430
he added in his both of his hands.
You can't count.

104
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.420
You can't count it.
He extended his hand to EA,
didn't extend it far enough.

105
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.430
The fuck motors the guy have to,

106
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.630
Dez Bryant basically got punished for having gigantic hands and being athletic.

107
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

108
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.810
<v 1>You don't even mean because anybody else would be so psyched.</v>

109
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:33.621
They just got the ball.

110
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.950
They would have fucking tucked it in and it would have been a catch.

111
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:40.580
But he was so fucking athletic that despite the fact that that guy was pulling

112
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:44.270
her down to the ground,
he still fucking caught it.
The other guy had positioned,

113
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.390
he still fucking call it,
caught it.
He was going down to the ground.

114
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:51.140
He's still maintain possession of the fucking ball and then has a presence of

115
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:54.960
mind to see the goal line and try to get it across,
which is,

116
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.270
that's what caused the ball not to be caught.

117
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

118
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.040
<v 1>It's cause Dez.
Brian is so fucking good.</v>

119
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:05.150
I mean that's another thing is the cowboys spent all this fucking money on this

120
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:05.984
guy,

121
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.470
a first round draft pick for that exact moment in the game and the guide

122
00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:14.060
delivered and that's stupid rule.
Takes it away.

123
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.013
<v 0>Ah,</v>

124
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.230
<v 1>a fucking unreal.
Jesus Christ.</v>

125
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.460
Is there anybody remotely athletic looking who can actually get on the TV and

126
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:28.390
tell me why that isn't a fucking catch.
Put it this way.
I understand why.

127
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:31.630
How we long thought it was a catch and that fucking nerd

128
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.770
<v 2>who goes out loud.
You know,
you can't count the steps.
Cy,
you can't tag,
you know,</v>

129
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:39.280
he has a bobble heads,
but it has to be clear and present danger.

130
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.450
Let they yay a motive involved and the Da,

131
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.150
you gotta take the due process.

132
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.480
Whatever the fuck he was talking about is you're watching literally like

133
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.060
<v 1>he was almost like a cult leader who was just telling you what you were seeing</v>

134
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:56.640
wasn't happening.
So they'll still think you know,

135
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.080
his version of Jesus or whatever
he,
he,
he,

136
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.410
he caught the fucking ball.
That's another thing.
Another rule.

137
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:09.330
Let's just talk about NFL rules here.
Ground can't cause the fumble.
Why

138
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.820
the ground causes a fumble every fucking game.
I see it all the time.

139
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.530
The ground can't cause a fumble.

140
00:08:16.531 --> 00:08:20.520
You just don't call it the ground causes way more fumbles than Lawrence Taylor

141
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.280
ever fucking did.
Ground can't cause a fumble.

142
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.130
That's bullshit.
You should say we don't count it.
If the ground causes a fumble.

143
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.390
I mean that,
that's,
that's how I looked at that plate.

144
00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:36.240
Dez Bryant caught the ball and then the ground cause the fumble and then he

145
00:08:36.241 --> 00:08:37.290
fucking recovered it.

146
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.493
<v 0>Okay.</v>

147
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.373
<v 1>No,</v>

148
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.570
not according to rule number 98.75 and the g the book of Genesis.

149
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.060
What a crock of shit that fucking rule is or is it a good rule and it just had

150
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.580
an unfortunate time of rearing its ugly head.
I got to a second.

151
00:08:55.581 --> 00:09:00.140
Is all those fat cheesy morons fucking nodding their jobs right now.

152
00:09:00.141 --> 00:09:03.140
Can you hear it?
Can you hear him shaking up in Rhineland,
Ryan Lander,

153
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.710
whatever the fuck.
I used to do gigs out there.
Um,

154
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.100
and I didn't have a fucking dog in that fight.

155
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.260
I just as an NFL fan was like oh my God,

156
00:09:12.261 --> 00:09:15.920
the cowboys and I've got to get a touchdown and go up and I get to see if the

157
00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:18.170
packers can answer just now.
No,
nope.

158
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.400
The nerds come out with their fucking protractors.
Do you understand that?

159
00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:24.500
They just said you can't count the steps.

160
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.160
The guy caught the ball and is running as he's falling to the ground.

161
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.940
He still running
cause he sat level of an athlete and they go,

162
00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:36.910
you can't count that.
All right,

163
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.150
whatever of Jesus Christ,

164
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.280
Jesus Christ.

165
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.010
I mean that almost killed the excitement I had of the Patriot speeding the

166
00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:47.740
ravens.
That's how much I fucking hate this.

167
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.410
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

168
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.870
<v 1>the turn that sports have taken,</v>

169
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.590
you know where they got all these fucking causes attached to everything and

170
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:58.440
people crying during the fucking commercials and then this shit,

171
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.200
you get to watch a guy make a fucking great catch and then it's taken away

172
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:02.034
because of it.

173
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.390
The last [inaudible] of the fucking move.
That's what they look at.

174
00:10:07.391 --> 00:10:11.170
Everything else of that amazing play not,
doesn't count,

175
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.170
doesn't fucking count.
And there's another thing too,

176
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.390
the amount of fucking morons that don't understand the definition of Karma.

177
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.500
Who sat there and said,
hey it's Karma baby.
You know,

178
00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:28.760
cause there was a ship called the week before that went in favor of the cowboys.

179
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.370
The cowboys didn't make the call.

180
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.230
All the cowboys are guilty of is showing up and playing the Detroit lions.

181
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:42.050
If anybody's going to pay for those bad calls,
it's still refs the refs.

182
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.420
Fuck the lions,
not the cowboys.

183
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.190
So then the rest come back the next week and what are they doing?

184
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:53.780
Are they evening out their Karma?
What does that mean?

185
00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:56.930
So that means I could go out and go murder somebody and then the next week I

186
00:10:56.931 --> 00:10:59.720
help an old lady across the fucking street and then it's even,

187
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.780
it isn't.
They fucked.

188
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.720
They fucked up two weeks in a god damn bro.
I Dunno.

189
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.070
I just,
I can't fucking believe this.

190
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.190
Not a catch the stupidest thing ever.
He caught the ball.

191
00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:22.630
You can't count that.
He's still going down to the ground.

192
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.400
Yeah,
he's getting tackled.

193
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.450
He had to jump over the guy he's getting tackled and he's still maintain control

194
00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:29.284
of the fucking ball.

195
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.470
And anybody who tries to say when he reached out with that ball that that ball

196
00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:35.860
isn't right as rain and it's not even moving and that Dez Bryant does not have

197
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:37.660
completely come complete control of that.

198
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.010
You're a packer fan or you're a fucking,
yeah,
I don't know what you are.

199
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:48.550
I don't know what you're looking at that he clearly has like the fact that

200
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.610
the fact that it has to be up against your fucking body.

201
00:11:53.611 --> 00:11:56.850
The guy's clearly reaching towards the goal line.
I like,
all right,
I'm done.

202
00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.710
I'm done.
All right,
we're going to go reverse here in reverse direction.

203
00:12:01.711 --> 00:12:05.490
We'll do the Sunday games.
And then the Saturday games,
um,

204
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.720
the colts
beat the Broncos Bolt,

205
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:12.240
Paul Versey and uh,

206
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.980
Jason Law had both called that law had even went as far as to say that it's the

207
00:12:16.981 --> 00:12:20.520
cults rush for a hundred yards against the Broncos.

208
00:12:20.521 --> 00:12:25.050
They were going to win by two scores,
so he extra called it.
And um,

209
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.210
and once again,
I feel vindicated after 10 years,

210
00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:33.000
way back in the day when we were winning championships and they were still

211
00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:36.540
saying,
if you had to build a team,
you know,
if I had to pick a guy,

212
00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:40.740
I'd go with Peyton manning over,
Tom Brady.
Um,
I'm telling you,

213
00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:44.790
I don't know what the fuck it is.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

214
00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:46.170
But you saw it this weekend.

215
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.910
One guy was down by 14 points twice and still won the game.

216
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.680
And the other guy,
uh,
you know,
you saw what happened.
Okay,

217
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:00.950
I'm sick of that fucking argument.
All right.
I've said it forever.

218
00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:05.780
If you want 600 yards in October,
you know who you want.

219
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.120
If you want to win in January,
you know who you want.
All right,
that's it.

220
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.020
Go Fuck Yourself.
Okay.
And Hey,
cults,
fence.

221
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.430
How psyched to you that he was on the other side of the ball.
Now,
you know,

222
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.690
you got Andrew Luck.
You know,
a little love on Andrew.
Luck is,
I guess,
you know,

223
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.740
you need to go to Stanford.

224
00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:28.190
He was a three point something GPA and I guess he's a super smart guy.

225
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.590
I love the fact that he's a super smart guy,

226
00:13:30.591 --> 00:13:33.730
but he looks like he should be barefoot wearing overalls.

227
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:36.770
Sit next to a moonshine still.
You know,

228
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.780
he looks like right on it like central casting.

229
00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:42.830
Like he'd just be sitting there with some straw hanging out of his mouth.
Um,

230
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.520
and I think that they're going to give the Patriots a hell of a fucking game

231
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:50.000
next weekend.
That's once again,
just like when we played the ravens,

232
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.800
I wasn't going to be surprised if we lost at home because,
uh,

233
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.570
through the fucking rave is man,
what an organization they are,
you know,

234
00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.030
losing all those guys.
Ed Read Ray Lewis and ray rice and they still come out.

235
00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:06.530
They get a beast at running back.

236
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.900
How fucking horrific that we look against the run.
Letting up that guy,

237
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.230
that guy must have average like 12 yards per carry in the first half.
Um,

238
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.750
that came was an absolute classic and I'm not going to fucking shit talking or

239
00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:21.680
anything about that because,
uh,
I actually,
I liked the ravens.

240
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.840
I think their organization is a,

241
00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:25.910
I think they're a great fucking organization and a,

242
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.330
I wish that we had the knack for drafting,
drafting,

243
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:32.310
defensive players the way they do or what the,

244
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:35.490
whatever the fuck they're doing down there.
Um,

245
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.310
so I didn't see the Seattle game because I was flying out,
uh,

246
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.480
flying out to New Orleans.
But,
um,

247
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.510
I did see bits and pieces of it and I'm sticking with that.
That's my pic to uh,

248
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.000
to win the Superbowl,
um,
is gonna be the,

249
00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.050
the Seattle Seahawks are going to repeat unless they completely fuck up.

250
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.610
Which would be fun to see,
you know,

251
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.920
with all the bandwagon Seahawk fans now,

252
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.920
which you always get when we got the band wagon,
fucking patriots fans,

253
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.790
all those jerk offs coming to the stadium now dress like fucking Paul revere

254
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.130
showing up to the game with your dumb long rifle.

255
00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:17.170
Whatever the fuck you doin Dick.
Where were those guys?

256
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.490
Were those guys back in the day?

257
00:15:18.491 --> 00:15:22.720
One of Sullivan Stadium Look like some glorified high school program?

258
00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.040
Where the fuck were they?
They would know her.

259
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.590
So I'm not shitting on when I shit on Seahawk fans.

260
00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:30.610
I'm not shitting on those people that fucking sat in the kingdom and Seahawk

261
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.440
fans.
You know who the fuck I'm shitting on

262
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.520
that was fucking jerk off showing up.
Peyton themselves green.

263
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.080
Who does that with your construction helmet?
This,

264
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.290
how many of those fucking people that wear those construction helmets are

265
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:48.470
actually construction people working on a job site?

266
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.710
How shameful would that be
if you actually showed up?

267
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:58.670
We were in a construction helmet and you can't construct anything,
right.

268
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.800
I would be as offended if he showed up wearing a fucking apron and he couldn't

269
00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:04.310
make a pie crust from scratch.

270
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.990
Fucking jerk off showing up with your fucking American flag on the side of your

271
00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:12.780
helmet.
Oh God.

272
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.560
It turns out to you're an accountant who just does p 90 x.

273
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.093
<v 3>Okay.</v>

274
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.880
<v 1>And who paints your back?
That's what I want to know.
Is it your buddy?</v>

275
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.970
Does he put the green makeup on your back?

276
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.080
It's the whole fucking thing is just so dungeons and dragons.

277
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:35.310
It just gives me chills.
I can't handle it.
So anyways,
next week,

278
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.960
um,
I've gotta be honest with you.
I don't know who the fuck's gonna win.

279
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.663
I have no idea ma'am.

280
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.270
Go sticking with my pick that Seattle's gonna re repeat and uh,

281
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.360
you know,
and other than that,

282
00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:51.390
I just got a bunch of cliches of anything can happen if anybody can beat the

283
00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:55.530
fucking sea hawks.
It's the fucking packers or whatever.
But,
um,

284
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.320
I think it's going to be a patriot.

285
00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:04.020
Seattle and the Superbowl and I,

286
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.890
I dunno the fact that we got absolutely no pressure on Joe Flacco and we were

287
00:17:10.561 --> 00:17:13.200
actually getting manhandled by two rookie lineman.

288
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.690
I don't think that that's a good thing considering they have a Wilson and

289
00:17:18.691 --> 00:17:21.990
fucking whatever the fuck his name is there,

290
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:26.340
who ran through the entire saints.
Uh,
Marshawn Lynch,

291
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.350
I don't think that's going to be a good thing for us.
And uh,
yeah,

292
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.260
I would say that I would say that.

293
00:17:35.261 --> 00:17:38.530
And it just put as far as like the defense is that be played up against to see

294
00:17:38.531 --> 00:17:41.560
how much Brady has been on his back,
um,

295
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.490
to then go up against Seattle who looks like they are the best fucking defense

296
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:49.060
out there.
Like,
I just,
I mean that's,
it's not fucking rocket science.
I mean,

297
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:54.230
as a patriots fan,
I hope that we would beat them,
but,
uh,
I dunno.
I don't know.

298
00:17:54.231 --> 00:17:56.410

I don't fucking know,
Dude.
You know,
I am.

299

Getting paid to stay in shape while helping others reach their fitness goals.

Come on.
As a football fan,

392
00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:43.150
you didn't want to see the cowboys score and then seek Aaron Rodgers come down

and answer it.
Yeah,
go fuck yourself anyways.

394
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

395
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.600
<v 1>Hey,
can I talk about this week?
Oh I uh,</v>

396
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.400
as far as the helicopter license thing goes,

397
00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:58.350
I sold it for the first time this week off airport.
Uh,

398
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.230
the first one I did was as it goes,
45 minute round trip,

399
00:24:02.231 --> 00:24:03.520
but the second one I threw,

400
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.580
I flew for three hours and six minutes by myself over the La Basin and I'm not

401
00:24:08.891 --> 00:24:09.491
going to lie to you.

402
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:14.110
That was the scariest fucking thing I've ever done in my life.
And uh,

403
00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.110
I told my instructor that too.
When I came back,

404
00:24:17.111 --> 00:24:19.900
I was told them I was scared shitless and he laughed his ass off and said that

405
00:24:19.901 --> 00:24:23.950
he was too.
So it actually made me feel normal cause I gotta be honest with you.

406
00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:27.370
By the time I got back to the airport,
I didn't want to fly anymore.

407
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.350
I was looking down at the Hobbs meter and I had to have three hours by myself or

408
00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:34.450
Ross.
This lesson didn't count and I got there.

409
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.440
I looked down and I was like a 24 minutes short,

410
00:24:38.441 --> 00:24:42.850
like the Hobbs meter rolls in like six minute intervals.
So I was,
you know,

411
00:24:42.851 --> 00:24:44.650
six times four is 24 minutes short.

412
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.420
So I had to fly the fucking traffic pattern for like 24 minutes before I finally

413
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.260
set the thing down.

414
00:24:50.261 --> 00:24:53.710
And I'll tell you my favorite part of the flight was when I pulled the mixture

415
00:24:53.711 --> 00:24:55.000
and the fucking engine shut off.

416
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.390
The scariest fucking thing.
It was also awesome.

417
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.800
You know what it is?
It's in between.
In between airports is cool.

418
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.050
Making the radio calls in that even though I fuck him up.

419
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.573
<v 0>MMM.</v>

420
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.240
<v 1>It's going.
When you get to an airport,
it's like,</v>

421
00:25:19.241 --> 00:25:20.560
am I going to be able to see it?

422
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.620
Am I going to get in the traffic pattern the right way?

423
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.280
Do I know which way the runways,
all of that fucking shit.

424
00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:29.530
Even though you know it,
you just sitting there going,
oh my God,

425
00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:32.350
what if I fuck this up?
What if I fuck this up?
What if I fuck this up?

426
00:25:32.351 --> 00:25:36.910
And it's the biggest fucking relief when you join the traffic pattern,

427
00:25:36.911 --> 00:25:38.950
you get clearance and everything and you did it right.

428
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.340
I did one came in low approach and then took off,
which means I don't land.

429
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.250
And I was like,
okay,
thank God,
thank God that's fucking over.

430
00:25:47.251 --> 00:25:49.860
And then I had to go land at this other one and uh,

431
00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:51.790
<v 0>yeah,</v>

432
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.211
<v 1>I dunno.</v>

433
00:25:52.211 --> 00:25:55.240
I came back and I was on the wrong fucking frequency and I'm calling the fucking

434
00:25:55.241 --> 00:25:56.830
airport and then not,
you know,

435
00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.560
they're not hearing what I'm saying and I'm going and the information I need is

436
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:06.150
in the like in the compartment under the seat.
So I'm literally going like,

437
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:10.350
now what the fuck do I do?
Do I get to fly back to the other airport,

438
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.620
get into their airspace?
That's what I got to do.

439
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.850
Now I've got to ask them what the fuck the frequency is.

440
00:26:14.851 --> 00:26:16.350
But fortunately the tower picked it up,

441
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.650
saw me coming in and told me what frequency I needed to be on,

442
00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.690
which was such a fucking relief.
And,
um,

443
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.290
dude,
I gotta tell you,
I've fucking,
I've gone skydiving.
I did.

444
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.640
It's doing stand up showtime at the Apollo.
I'm trying to think like,

445
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.850
other than,
you know,
maybe,
I don't know,
walking into the ocean,

446
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.740
I went snorkeling one time and the fucking care of being,
and that was,

447
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.410
that was right up.
There was nothing,
nothing scary set.

448
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:52.070
Just looking over at that fucking empty seat.
Just go.
And like,

449
00:26:52.071 --> 00:26:54.070
if anything fucks up right now,
this is on me.

450
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.343
<v 3>MMM.</v>

451
00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.510
<v 1>Fucking emotionally spent.
Then I went home and I,
uh,</v>

452
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.420
I'm not gonna lie to you had a belt,
a whiskey,
and it felt,

453
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.120
I felt a little better.
But,
uh,

454
00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.910
then a couple of nights later I had my first night flight and did that with an

455
00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:11.920
instructor and it was the coolest fucking thing I ever did.

456
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.780
And I actually got to transition,

457
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.713
<v 3>uh,</v>

458
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.280
<v 1>Bravo airspace over fucking,
uh,</v>

459
00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.400
lax at night.

460
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:25.930
It was the coolest thing I ever fucking did as far as flying as I'm flying.

461
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.740
You know,
you transition,
I think it was like at 1500 feet.

462
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.100
This literally like a commercial jet landing underneath you.

463
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.180
Just fucking unreal is fucking unreal.

464
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.760
<v 0>Okay.</v>

465
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.020
<v 1>I felt like I was in die hard.</v>

466
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.063
<v 3>Okay.</v>

467
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:49.180
<v 1>And um,
I'm not gonna lie to you,
man.</v>

468
00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:55.140
Flew all the way up to Camp Marilla airport landed there and it's just a whole

469
00:27:56.021 --> 00:28:00.470
other fucking world.
Some flying this little egg beater,
right?

470
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.920
Robinson are 20 to look it up.
Yeah,
I know.

471
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.110
It looks fucking small and it is small.

472
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.230
It's basically the smart car of fucking helicopters.

473
00:28:09.231 --> 00:28:13.130
But what I like about it is because it's so not complex,

474
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.450
there's way less less shit that can possibly fail on the fucking thing.

475
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.390
But anyways,
you land at these airports and then you just see,

476
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.090
you just see this whole other world

477
00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.230
of just people you don't run into because they have their own airplanes,

478
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.810
you know,
like,
I dunno,

479
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.000
I dunno what these people do for a fucking living,

480
00:28:34.001 --> 00:28:37.180
but my instructors go in like just pointing out the planes.

481
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.390
That's 8 million.
That's 15 million.

482
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:45.750
That's a g six Jerry Jones or the cowboys has one that's 52 fucking million.

483
00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:47.220
52 million

484
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.053
<v 3>Dallas.</v>

485
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.320
<v 1>What are the monthly payments on that?
How do you even buy a jet?</v>

486
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.660
Is it like going in when you get a car and you go in there and some,
you know,

487
00:29:00.661 --> 00:29:01.710
you're looking at the jet,

488
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.010
you just walk up on the lot and then some scumbag comes walking around the other

489
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:09.510
side.
Hey,
you like this?
Well it's a g six.
It's got his hands in his pocket,

490
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:13.120
rubbing his fucking ball bag.
What do we got a do at a,

491
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:18.000
they get you when this jet tomorrow?
Um,
I'm sure you don't.

492
00:29:18.001 --> 00:29:18.834
Right?

493
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:19.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

494
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.600
<v 1>I think when you buy big shit like that,
don't you just call up?</v>

495
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:24.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

496
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.310
<v 1>You don't want to sell cigarettes,
rob and mark and then they just fucking,</v>

497
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:32.850
you don't stock it up with booze and whores and they give it to you with a big

498
00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:37.200
bow on it.
Isn't that what you do?
Pay for it with your blood diamond money?

499
00:29:37.201 --> 00:29:41.540
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck happens,
but,
um,
yeah,
I'm about month out.

500
00:29:41.541 --> 00:29:45.010
I got six more flights and a,
I'm doing all the pre,
uh,

501
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.610
the pre right now to finally go and get my license and uh,
I can't fucking wait.

502
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

503
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.610
<v 1>I can't fucking wait.</v>

504
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:54.310
This is something that I never thought I'd be able to accomplish because I'm

505
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:59.110
fucking stupid.
And uh,
I knew I'd be able to fly the God damn thing,

506
00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:02.320
but it's the ground school and all the science and physics behind it.

507
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.340
I thought I was going to fuck up,
but I actually,
I actually really enjoyed it.

508
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.400
I was having flashbacks and when I was in high school and I didn't know the

509
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:12.160
answers and all that shit and I didn't get stuff.
But,
uh,

510
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.980
fortunately I had really good instructors,
so it's been going,

511
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:18.990
it's been going pretty good so far.
That's all I can tell you.

512
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.370
Um,
part of that night flight came out of the valley,

513
00:30:23.371 --> 00:30:24.840
went right up over Griffith Park,

514
00:30:24.841 --> 00:30:29.841
flew between the observatory and the fucking Hollywood sign they need,

515
00:30:29.941 --> 00:30:30.870
just follow the road,

516
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.900
made a left down the fucking 101 went right down downtown La and as calm and

517
00:30:36.051 --> 00:30:38.880
flying down started heading south.

518
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

519
00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.600
<v 1>I'm seeing these,
this thing it looks like,</v>

520
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.400
<v 0>okay.</v>

521
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.670
<v 1>The top of a smokestack.
Like what the fuck is that?
And it was the,</v>

522
00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:49.450
the fireworks over Disneyland.
He always killing me.

523
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.750
I was saying to my instructor,
go,

524
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.340
that's Disney didn't win is right fucking there.

525
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.030
Like when you drive to Disneyland from fucking Los Angeles,

526
00:30:58.031 --> 00:31:00.340
it seems like it's fucking 400 miles away.

527
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

528
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.410
<v 1>And I'm literally sitting in this helicopter and looking back over my shoulder</v>

529
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:08.650
to roughly where I live and then looking over my other shoulder and I could see

530
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:12.850
where Disneyland is.
It's like,
Gee,
I could ride a bicycle there
anyways.

531
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.260
I'm not boring you with this shit.

532
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:16.380
<v 0>MMM.</v>

533
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.140
<v 1>Let's get onto some of the reeds here this week.
Uh,
oh,
by the way.
Um,</v>

534
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:24.390
here's something.
This is a,
this is not even an advertisement.

535
00:31:24.391 --> 00:31:28.720
It's just a good thing that you can do,
uh,
be the match.org.
Uh,

536
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.240
it's a national registry for donating bone marrow.
Uh,
they send you a kit,

537
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.500
a you swab.
Oh my God.
I thought they were going to say you do it yourself.

538
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:41.370
Just fucking jam a needle in there.
No,
they send you a kit.

539
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.910
You Swab your cheek and mail it back.
If you're a match,

540
00:31:44.911 --> 00:31:48.300
you can save someone's life.
They handle all expenses.
Uh,

541
00:31:48.301 --> 00:31:53.040
also saving someone's life is a great story to help you get laid.
Thanks.

542
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.710
Who the hell wrote that?
Uh,

543
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.740
tons of emails calling you out on the traffic gap.

544
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.120
95% of them explained the importance of safety and efficiency.

545
00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:06.330
Two examples below.
Okay,
here we go.
The traffic gap.

546
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.843
<v 0>MMM.</v>

547
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.161
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

548
00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:11.650
I've got a lot of these people who talk about how you drive a stick shift.

549
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.900
First off,
I have a stick shift.

550
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:17.020
So rather than driving bumper to bumper and writing my clutch,

551
00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:22.000
I give myself some room so that once I see those red brake lights come on in

552
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:25.420
front of me,
I let off the gas and then accelerate again.

553
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.100
Once the brake light goes off.

554
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.630
I hardly ever have to come to a complete stop and shift yet might sound selfish

555
00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:32.680
and lazy,
but whatever.

556
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.940
I'm sure it was some selfish texting jerk off that got in the accident up the

557
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:40.370
road that caused all of the traffic to begin with.
Oh yeah.
There you go.

558
00:32:40.371 --> 00:32:44.120
Justify how you don't understand how to drive a stick shift.

559
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:50.650
You know,
all you gotta do,
first of all,
you're not riding your clutch.

560
00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.450
Riding a clutch is when you have it partially engaged and disengaged and you're

561
00:32:55.451 --> 00:32:59.800
hitting the gas that is riding the clutch.
All right?

562
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.480
All you gotta do is as you coast up,

563
00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:06.100
just put it in neutral and you can take your foot off.
You could do that.

564
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.140
You could give a fuck about the person behind you.

565
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

566
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.160
<v 1>Riding the clutch.
Um,
anyways,</v>

567
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.700
I'm going to burn out my clutch man.
Doing what?

568
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.960
Engaging it properly.
Um,
secondly,
I don't,

569
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.580
I guess you may be the,
the,
the other components of it,
but the clutch itself,

570
00:33:25.581 --> 00:33:28.850
you're not going to wear burnout,
right.
Anyway.
Secondly,

571
00:33:28.851 --> 00:33:32.360
a lot of traffic is formed just because people are merging onto the highway and

572
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:35.720
without providing some space.
How the fuck will the flow startup again,

573
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.990
please tell me you're not one of those dishes that doesn't let people merge

574
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:42.680
because you think you have more important shit to get to a no,

575
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:46.550
but I'm also not one of those dishes that thinks that people changing lanes

576
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.260
causes traffic.
Okay.

577
00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:54.250
What causes traffic as there's not too many fucking people and not enough lanes

578
00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.170
for the amount of people on the highway.

579
00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:01.510
I'm sure people cutting in and out doesn't help.
Okay.

580
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:06.640
But I changed lanes all the time when I drive down the road.

581
00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:09.610
And if there's no nobody on the road,
it doesn't cause traffic.

582
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.150
Um,
yeah,
that's just,
just some bullshit.
They know.
I let people on the,

583
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.200
on the road.
I've actually,
now that I've started flying,

584
00:34:20.201 --> 00:34:24.970
I have actually become way more fucking courteous,
a driver.
But,
um,

585
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.120
and when somebody cuts me off and actually does a crazy move,

586
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.200
so I don't flip out,
I just go,
I've done that.
It's a good move.
I can't get mad.

587
00:34:32.201 --> 00:34:33.990
I can't get mad at an,
at an aggressive move.

588
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.400
It's that just that fucking,

589
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:39.480
<v 0>okay.</v>

590
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.180
<v 1>Just lay it back 20 fucking car lengths.</v>

591
00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:48.060
It's just so fucking selfish.
Just pull up.

592
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.660
Everybody wants to get to where they're going just inch up as the traffic is

593
00:34:51.661 --> 00:34:54.480
inching up.
Do everybody else to fucking solid.

594
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.670
You're not burning out your clutch.
You know,

595
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.340
you decide you're the one who decided to get a fucking stick shift.

596
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:03.440
Did you think you were never going to run into traffic?

597
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.550
So now everybody behind you have to,
dude,
I got to fucking,
oh,

598
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:08.810
my old truck.

599
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

600
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.290
<v 1>That thing's a motherfucker has to shift.</v>

601
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:15.860
I don't even have power steering on that Goddamn thing.
I come home.

602
00:35:15.861 --> 00:35:19.790
I'm an old man.
I'm tired when I drive it,
but I still pull up you lazy.
Fuck.

603
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.380
Anyways.
Secondly,
a lot of traffic swarm just because,
oh no,
I actually read that.

604
00:35:24.381 --> 00:35:27.410
Okay.
Number two,
a billion on the,
uh,

605
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:31.220
on this last week show you work yourself up into a normal,
your normal friends.

606
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:34.550
He just thinking about due to leave space in front of them and traffic and

607
00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:37.320
couldn't fathom any reason why you someone could do this.
The,

608
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.390
the fact that you used the word fathom.
I'm expect,
I'm accepting,
uh,

609
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.940
expecting that you're going to be doing something.

610
00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:47.320
You're going to really talk down to me here.
Um,
I'm one of those guys though,

611
00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:49.090
maybe not exactly what you were describing,

612
00:35:49.091 --> 00:35:52.600
that leased space in front of my car and traffic.
Uh,
there,

613
00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:56.590
there is a simple reason why fluid dynamics.

614
00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:02.550
A few years ago I stumbled upon this website traffic waves.org and it changed my

615
00:36:02.561 --> 00:36:04.090
whole way of thinking about traffic.

616
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.960
I'm not a scientist so I can't do as good a job explains traffic is this guy.

617
00:36:07.961 --> 00:36:12.190
But essentially traffic jams can be thought of as traveling waves of

618
00:36:12.191 --> 00:36:17.191
condensation and a single driver can disrupt these waves by anticipating jams

619
00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.750
and maintaining a constant rate of travel rather than engaging in stop and go

620
00:36:22.751 --> 00:36:26.440
traffic,
uh,
and go with the flow of stuff.
Traffic.

621
00:36:26.441 --> 00:36:30.820
A single driver has the effect of disrupting the traffic wave for the vehicles

622
00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:34.810
behind that driver.
Yeah,
I've done that.
I've slowed how quickly I've come up,

623
00:36:34.811 --> 00:36:36.280
but I'm talking about leaving,

624
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.000
leaving like I know exactly what you're talking about.

625
00:36:40.001 --> 00:36:44.090
I actually experimented one time if I could drive like,

626
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:48.730
cause you'll see like traffic moving up and stopping and then you see the ripple

627
00:36:48.731 --> 00:36:52.990
of movement coming towards you and then as that ripple movements coming towards

628
00:36:52.991 --> 00:36:56.770
you,
you see where it stops,
starts to move again and then you experiment.

629
00:36:56.771 --> 00:36:57.604
Can I keep,

630
00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:03.570
keep everybody behind me to continue moving without having to step on the break.

631
00:37:03.701 --> 00:37:04.391
I've done that,

632
00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:07.960
but you don't have to do that for fucking 50 fucking car lengths behind you

633
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.310
because when you do that,
everybody starts cutting into your lane anyways.

634
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.650
I'll continue with what he's saying.
In other words,

635
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:19.780
if I drive at a constant rate of speed approaching and through a traffic jam,

636
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.220
sole other drives drivers behind me and the jam itself will disappear.

637
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

638
00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:29.370
<v 1>Um,
no.
What does it,
it doesn't disappear you,</v>

639
00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.710
there's still a zillion cars in front of you and you're going half a mile an

640
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.543
hour.

641
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.870
So rather than going 18 miles an hour and then stopping and then going 80 miles

642
00:37:38.871 --> 00:37:39.920
an hour and stopping,

643
00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.770
you just going to consistently go half a mile of fucking hour and then

644
00:37:42.771 --> 00:37:46.850
mathematically you feel like you're going faster
anyway.
So,

645
00:37:46.851 --> 00:37:51.290
so besides saving me the mental stress of stop and go traffic,
I drive a stick.

646
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:54.440
So it's especially annoying and save the wear on my car.

647
00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.970
I'm also improving the driving conditions for my fellow company commuters.

648
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.760
Oh Jesus.
This guy's making himself into being a hero.

649
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.660
Something to think about the next time you screaming at the slow guy in front of

650
00:38:05.661 --> 00:38:09.030
you.
I knew it the second he said fathom.

651
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.830
I knew there was going to be some sort of life lesson in there.
Um,
I,

652
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.420
you guys are fooling yourself.

653
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.383
<v 0>Okay?</v>

654
00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.230
<v 1>Okay.
You're eliminating the stop and go part of the traffic,</v>

655
00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:23.890
but you're not eliminating the traffic and you're completely ignoring the fact

656
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.700
that this way too fucking many people on the road for the amount of fucking

657
00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:32.080
lanes,
there's still traffic.
All right.

658
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.560
With the little ripple theater,
uh,
theory there,
I don't buy into it.
Um,

659
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.220
other than the fact that you can keep it

660
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.930
going at a ridiculously low rate of speed.
Um,

661
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.200
I think it's common sense that somebody then cutting into your lane cause they

662
00:38:48.201 --> 00:38:52.430
then take up that space that that will cause you to stop.
But this,

663
00:38:52.431 --> 00:38:57.431
this fantasy that if everybody just stayed in their lanes and coasted along,

664
00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.700
that you wouldn't be late now and that there would be no traffic.

665
00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.710
I guess there would be no stop in the tree.
They was still be fucking traffic.

666
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.630
Alright,
there you go.
Okay.
[inaudible] devastated.
Hi Bill.

667
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:16.310
I'm from the UK and I've recently discovered your brand of comedy.
Wait,

668
00:39:16.311 --> 00:39:19.340
let's go back to the traffic thing.
Okay.

669
00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:24.230
So how about everybody who's listening to this stuff?
All right.

670
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.100
How about you try to keep it moving by doing that type of thing while you also

671
00:39:28.101 --> 00:39:31.580
agree that you're still in a traffic jam.
Can we all do that?

672
00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.930
There's a little bit of both.
Everybody happy?
I'm devastated.

673
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.930
I want everybody who get buys a stick shift know that you're going to be in

674
00:39:38.931 --> 00:39:42.320
traffic someday and that it's going to suck and don't make the person behind.

675
00:39:42.321 --> 00:39:43.940
You have to fucking pay for your,
uh,

676
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.473
<v 0>you know,</v>

677
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.590
<v 1>you're fucking decision to get a standard rather than an automatic.
All right?</v>

678
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:51.460
Devastated.
Hi,
Bill.

679
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:54.310
I'm from the UK and I've recently discovered your brand of comedy,

680
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:55.750
which is fantastic.
Well,
thank you.

681
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.840
My brother who lives in Pittsburgh was over in the UK in December,

682
00:39:58.841 --> 00:40:02.650
and I was showing him your standup on Netflix and he's now spreading the joy.

683
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.670
However,

684
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:08.670
imagine to our horror when our 64 year old mom decides to tell us that she

685
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:15.100
really fancies the ginger guy.
You were just watching,

686
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.100
um,
what I was just watching

687
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.910
your work.
He rushed.
You wrote your just,
you mean you were watching.

688
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.200
My Dad is a ginger,

689
00:40:25.201 --> 00:40:29.550
so I suppose it's inner standable not understandable.

690
00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:32.130
It's understandable.
Uh,
keep up the good work.

691
00:40:32.131 --> 00:40:34.830
Love to see you in the UK sometime and go fuck yourself.

692
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.383
<v 0>Uh,</v>

693
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.310
<v 1>wait a minute.
I don't understand the whole,
what the fuck was that whole thing?</v>

694
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.793
<v 0>Okay.</v>

695
00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:46.030
<v 1>You enjoy me?
Oh,</v>

696
00:40:46.031 --> 00:40:50.110
fancies as enlights me thinks I'm a good looking guy.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

697
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:55.000
That's right buddy.
Deal with it.
Deal with the image of your mother riding me.

698
00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.360
That's disgusting.
I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ.
Do it or you don't.

699
00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:03.250
If you worked on your pronouns and your spelling,

700
00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:07.390
I could've got that all in one take.
All right.
Extra point.

701
00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.650
Billy botched snapper.
Uh,

702
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.300
my brother and I were kickers back in the back in our day.

703
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:16.060
He played d one college football.
I wasn't that good,

704
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:19.360
but still better than most kickers in high school at the time.
Anyways,

705
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:21.820
I wanted to defend the extra point just like you do.

706
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:26.080
It isn't the most difficult thing to do,
but it's super.
But it's super important.

707
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.200
I've missed an extra point when time was expired,

708
00:41:29.201 --> 00:41:33.600
which resulted in a one point loss for our team.
Jesus Christ,
let me tell you,

709
00:41:33.601 --> 00:41:36.300
that weighs on a person heavily as a kicker.

710
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:41.100
He have all the eyes on you making a mistake,
um,
that much more.

711
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:44.670
Making mistake,
that much more noticeable true story while in college,

712
00:41:44.671 --> 00:41:49.260
my brother and missed an important kick and receive death threats for one kick

713
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.230
quarterbacks and running backs can often be balled out.

714
00:41:52.231 --> 00:41:55.800
Bikes failed up by excuses,
um,

715
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.770
such as the line didn't block well or whatever.

716
00:41:58.771 --> 00:42:03.000
The extra point looks so easy because football fans are having the opportunity

717
00:42:03.001 --> 00:42:07.830
to watch someone who takes time and puts effort into the craft of kicking watch

718
00:42:07.831 --> 00:42:10.590
a high school game or a college game where there's not a true quick,

719
00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.390
not a true kicker at the position.

720
00:42:12.391 --> 00:42:17.391
And I'm sure 99.9% or whatever don't get made.

721
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.420
Um,
I wouldn't say it's that high.
I can make an extra point,

722
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.720
but I still liked the extra point.
I am biased I guess,
but fuck it.

723
00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:28.200
Kicking is hard and unappreciated in my eye.
Underappreciated in my eyes.

724
00:42:28.201 --> 00:42:33.110
Thanks for the last and go fuck yourself.
Um,
yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.

725
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.950
Listen first.
Firstly,
we actually went for and all this weekend with his,

726
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:42.810
his,
um,
playoff pics.
And if you don't believe them,
listen to them,

727
00:42:42.811 --> 00:42:45.390
gloat about it for an hour on his podcast.

728
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.270
<v 4>Dad,
what do they say of fucking amazing.</v>

729
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.440
<v 1>Um,
but uh,
you know,
I don't know.
I'm one of those guys.
I liked it.</v>

730
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.400
I liked that nerdy shit.

731
00:42:56.170 --> 00:43:00.250
I'm so fucking sick of not being able to yell this week.
Jesus fucking Christ.

732
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.250
Um,
anyways,
what am I doing here?
Clan problems,

733
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.130
top Jesus Christ.
How fucking creepy is it?
By the way,

734
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:14.470
that horrific thing that happened in,
uh,

735
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.180
in France and now watching all these fucking people coming out there and trying

736
00:43:19.181 --> 00:43:21.040
to blame the goddamn religion over it,

737
00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.470
like we don't have Jesus freaks said blow up abortion clinics.
Uh,

738
00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.560
fucking I just fucking drives me nuts that adults can fucking think that way.

739
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.710
You know what I mean?
Good.
Fuck.
I mean,
you could basically,

740
00:43:37.711 --> 00:43:41.130
you could attach any bad thing that happens.

741
00:43:41.131 --> 00:43:44.940
All you'd have to do is just find out where it religion the person is and then

742
00:43:44.941 --> 00:43:48.690
everybody in that thing is fucking is fucking wrong.

743
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:50.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

744
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.090
<v 1>Then it is there.
They're fucking everywhere.
They're under your bed.</v>

745
00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.760
Then they try to get everybody into this giant panic.

746
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.510
I don't fucking get it.
It's like,
but like the,

747
00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:04.690
the whole fucking isis thing.

748
00:44:04.691 --> 00:44:06.460
You're literally talking about they don't have a navy,

749
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.620
they don't have any fucking air support
granite.

750
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.090
They could come over here and they could do something horrific.
Yes.

751
00:44:13.091 --> 00:44:17.040
But the level of what they could do versus what the fuck we can do.

752
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:23.520
I'm just not going to get into this panic and I live,
you know,

753
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.170
I live in Los Angeles and I go to La lax all the fucking time.

754
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:29.930
God knows what the fuck it happened.
All right.

755
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:33.450
But to sit there and to these fucking jerk offs on TV,

756
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:38.540
try to get me into this fearful state
that,

757
00:44:38.541 --> 00:44:39.780
you know,
we have to,
you know,

758
00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.050
just obliterate an entire fucking religion.

759
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:45.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

760
00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:50.440
<v 1>I don't,
and just watching adults just given to that,
it's just,
it's the most,</v>

761
00:44:50.441 --> 00:44:52.910
it's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.

762
00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.910
It's no different than like when that,
uh,

763
00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:00.830
a bola thing and everybody was freaking out.
Cause like 12 people had it.
Oh,
I,

764
00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:01.683
yeah.

765
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:03.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

766
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.230
<v 1>What's going to happen?</v>

767
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.570
What's going to happen is we're going to deal with it and everybody's going to

768
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:08.670
be fucking fine.
All right.

769
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.200
This shit that they say on TV is going to get a lot of innocent people,
you know,

770
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.990
something fucking horrible is going to happen to them.
So that,

771
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:17.160
that's your fucking response.

772
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

773
00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:22.930
<v 1>You know,
innocent people die.
So then more innocent people have to die.
It's just,</v>

774
00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:25.780
I dunno,
although fucking things depressing.
And with that,

775
00:45:25.781 --> 00:45:30.250
let's talk about clan problems.
Uh,
I live in rural Alabama and have a problem.

776
00:45:30.251 --> 00:45:35.251
Only someone in my savage ass backwards in bread area of the country could have,

777
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.800
I'm a 25 year old female and my dad,

778
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.870
my dad is a member of the local organization of the KKK.

779
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:44.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

780
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:48.950
<v 1>Um,
but by the way,
it's,
it's the Ku Klux Klan,
not the clue.</v>

781
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.650
Cool.
All right.

782
00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

783
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:57.060
<v 1>Like Yin and Yang.
It's not ying and Yang,
as I said forever.</v>

784
00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:02.090
I also said the Klu Klux Klan,
um,
a a,

785
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:06.780
anyways,
he's,
he's a,
he's a member of the local organization of the Ku Klux Klan.

786
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.760
I actually just for comedic reasons would love to go to a Klan meeting just to

787
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:12.990
listen to what they say.

788
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:17.400
And then I would just start talking and see how much shit I could make up just

789
00:46:17.401 --> 00:46:18.930
to hear him.
I know,
I know it,

790
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.410
I was taken after y'all the day I'm a full racist slur spewing white supremacy.

791
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.580
That's what a dad is.

792
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:31.610
I have a six year old daughter that I have that I had after a one night stand.

793
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.500
So the child is half Mexican,
half white.
Gee.

794
00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:38.250
I wonder how that happened and rebelled against your dad.
Look at that.

795
00:46:38.251 --> 00:46:40.530
You attract what you fear.
Uh,
my dad,

796
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.980
her grandfather treats her terribly.
Not,

797
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.090
not with like physical abuse or anything,
but horrible,
horrible name.
Calling.

798
00:46:49.091 --> 00:46:49.924
Taunting.

799
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

800
00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.990
<v 1>In quotes,
go back to Mexico.
You wet back.</v>

801
00:46:53.991 --> 00:46:56.240
He says that to a six year old to a fucking,

802
00:46:56.241 --> 00:47:00.680
she wrote to a fucking six year old girl.
I like that.

803
00:47:00.681 --> 00:47:03.050
Go back to Mexico when the kid was born here.

804
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.210
<v 3>Okay.</v>

805
00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.420
<v 1>Uh,
even though she doesn't really understand what they are saying to her,</v>

806
00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:12.820
it tears me up inside.

807
00:47:12.821 --> 00:47:17.650
Every time I take her to a gathering with them and subject her to this
treatment,

808
00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.310
I really wish I could just disown them.
That was going to be my suggestion.

809
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.350
Move to another part of America.

810
00:47:23.351 --> 00:47:26.890
There's actually civilized and wouldn't care about this,

811
00:47:26.891 --> 00:47:31.060
but I can't pull myself away from the fact it is my father and we're supposed to

812
00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:34.930
love each other.
Especially with the family centered society.

813
00:47:34.931 --> 00:47:39.820
We have a here in the south.
Uh,
but I feel like I'm being very selfish,

814
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:44.290
subjecting my daughter to this horrible abuse because I'm too weak to leave.
Uh,

815
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:47.400
what,
what,
what do you think I should do a,
first of all,

816
00:47:47.401 --> 00:47:49.000
you should stop being so hard on yourself.

817
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.220
You can't pick who your parents are and uh,
you know,

818
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:56.710
you're not being weak because that is your dad and you're going to love him.

819
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.820
I think you were actually a,
a well adjusted person.

820
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:03.580
Do you understand what you're doing to your daughter?
And I think,
you know,

821
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:07.180
the decision you're going to have to make.
And um,

822
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.720
I dunno,
I guess to make yourself feel better.
I would try to

823
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:18.090
give this guy another chance before he goes off to his clan meeting,
you know,

824
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.690
when he's got the sheet on,
but not the hood,
right?

825
00:48:20.691 --> 00:48:22.950
As he's putting it on just yet.
Hey Dad,
can I talk to you for a second?

826
00:48:22.951 --> 00:48:25.620
And he just lifts up the sheet.
Like,
oh,
what,
what's that?

827
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:29.160
What do you want to talk about?
And just give them a chance to say,
listen,

828
00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:34.090
I'm going to leave.
If you don't stop,
add,
fuck that.
He's not going to stop.

829
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:36.630
<v 0>You've got to leave.</v>

830
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.310
<v 1>You should just leave and then Skype with them,</v>

831
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.983
<v 0>you know,</v>

832
00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.810
<v 1>would that be the thing to do?
But I want to fucking horrible.
Uh,</v>

833
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:54.940
I can't believe that there's still the clan
you don't want,
I mean,

834
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:55.960
this,
this fucking,

835
00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:03.110
that's kind of seems so surreal to be that.
That's like a being in the climate.

836
00:49:03.111 --> 00:49:06.710
It's like wearing a powdered wig,
you know?
It's like you still doing that,

837
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.990
you know,
they've got a hair plugs.
Um,
anyways,

838
00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:14.480
I'll let you know something up that actually depresses the shit out of me.

839
00:49:14.481 --> 00:49:17.060
I'm sorry that you're going through that,
but I gotta be honest with you.
Uh,

840
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.250
the south gets a bad rap as far as people thinking that that's the only place

841
00:49:22.251 --> 00:49:26.600
that there's more ons to think horrible fucking things.
Uh,

842
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.320
look at some of the shit that was said about Muslims,

843
00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.330
the Muslim religion anyways,

844
00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:36.470
after what happened in France by people who weren't in the south.

845
00:49:36.471 --> 00:49:40.040
These are people who actually were journalists,
um,

846
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.790
went to college and all of that type of shit.
So,
uh,

847
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.813
<v 0>I dunno,</v>

848
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.370
<v 1>I don't fucking know,
but I would tell you it's,</v>

849
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.000
I wouldn't do that to a kid if your parents were saying some stuff like that.

850
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:56.970
That's just really not funny is it?
All right,
let's fucking read.
Uh,

851
00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.930
let's read some advertising here for this week.
Um,

852
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.800
where the fuck is it?
The live reads

853
00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.080
<v 0>now,
why I want that pop up.</v>

854
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.580
<v 1>I'm literally looking for the live reads and all I have right now.
It's just,
uh,</v>

855
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:15.750
uh,
there is some reason it was somebody drew this son and I was smiling at me.

856
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.110
All right.
stamps.com everybody,

857
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.720
one great resolution you can make for the new year.

858
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:25.470
Maximize every minute and every dollar for your small business.

859
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.030
I know an easy way to do that.

860
00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:30.810
stamps.com think about how much time you're wasting going to the post office

861
00:50:30.811 --> 00:50:33.090
driving there,
finding parking,

862
00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.060
talking to the homeless guy holding the door.
Dude,
I'll get you on the way out,

863
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.450
right?
stamps.com is the better way to get postage.

864
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.520
Just use what you already have your computer and printer to get official US

865
00:50:46.521 --> 00:50:51.270
postage for any letter or packages or package.
Sorry.
And then,
okay.

866
00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.540
Then the mailman picks it up with stamps.com everything you would do with the

867
00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:57.930
post office you can do right at home from your own Goddamn desk and at a

868
00:50:57.931 --> 00:51:01.380
fraction of the cost of one of those expensive postage meters.

869
00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.930
I've been using stamps.com for the last couple of years,

Legal Zoom
to,

878
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.600
do you know what else I heard when I was,
I was doing that flight.

879
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:41.430
That's solo flight as out on or the day before four and I did it with the

880
00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:45.430
instructor.
We were flying by this airport where they have people.
Uh,

881
00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.690
no.
I take people up to go skydiving and immediately of course,
the night before,

882
00:51:49.691 --> 00:51:50.471
I'm actually thinking like,

883
00:51:50.471 --> 00:51:53.670
what if somebody shoot doesn't open and that guy lands in my fucking main rotor?

884
00:51:53.671 --> 00:51:58.330
Yeah.
Then what do I do?
I plumb it to my death.
That's what I do.

885
00:51:59.000 --> 00:51:59.980
Um,
so anyways,

886
00:51:59.981 --> 00:52:04.981
we would come up on that airport and we hear this guy come on the radio and he's

887
00:52:05.051 --> 00:52:09.650
talking to the people down on the ground.
He goes,
he goes,
all right.
He goes,

888
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:13.080
that's the second time he goes,
that Korean guy,
okay.

889
00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:17.650
Jumped out of the airplane at full power.
It goes,

890
00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:22.420
he's going to rip my tail off some fucking maniac.

891
00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:24.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

892
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.130
<v 1>I guess it was his second time.
He's gone up this skydiving,</v>

893
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.680
you're supposed to wait till the plane slows down so you fall away from the

894
00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:36.681
plane rather than go directly back into this fucking maniac jumped out at full

895
00:52:36.781 --> 00:52:37.614
power.

896
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.433
<v 0>MMM.</v>

897
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:44.060
<v 1>And the combination of the anger and fear in this guy's voice,</v>

898
00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:48.220
cause he almost just fucking died cause this jerk off jumped out,
uh,

899
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.980
was hilarious to me.
Um,
anyways.

900
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:54.920
Anyways would've fucking going to do you know what's another scary thing too is

901
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:58.370
when somebody announces it position and you're saying like,

902
00:52:58.371 --> 00:53:03.230
you know I'm flying along the 10 at 1500 feet westbound base and traffic or

903
00:53:03.231 --> 00:53:03.590
whatever,

904
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:07.790
and then you hear somebody else announced that they're in your same area,

905
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.890
headed eastbound and they're roughly the same at altitude and immediately what I

906
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:17.630
do is I either climb or go down a couple of hundred fucking feet and you're just

907
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:21.410
like,
fuck,
where is he warehoused?
There he is.
There he is.

908
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.100
Thank Christ.
Um,
alright.
Legal Zoom everybody.

909
00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:29.650
What's your top New Year's resolution?
If you're like me,

910
00:53:29.651 --> 00:53:33.830
it's getting your life organized.
I didn't say that.

911
00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:37.610
Why do they,
why do they put fucking words in my mouth?

912
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:40.850
What's my top New Year's resolution?

913
00:53:40.851 --> 00:53:45.410
I'm trying to do one cigar a month even though I've only already smoked in
three.

914
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.750
All right,
let's,
let's read this the way I am.
Okay.

915
00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.510
What's your top New Year's resolution?
If you like me,

916
00:53:50.511 --> 00:53:54.770
it's cutting down on cigars,
but where do you begin now?

917
00:53:54.771 --> 00:53:56.060
This copy's not going to make sense.

918
00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.330
A great place to start is protecting your family.

919
00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:03.470
What and a great way to take control of your family's futures to make a living

920
00:54:03.471 --> 00:54:07.850
will or living trust?
Well,
I guess I could die from smoking cigars too much.

I have to do,

940
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.790
Um,
anyways,
I'll,
speaking of which another great comic past,

941
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.810
um,
the other day,
Taylor Negron,
everybody,
uh,

942
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:27.100
I only
only met him one time,
men have down at the Improv on Melrose.

943
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.090
And um,
I told him how much I loved this area.

944
00:55:31.091 --> 00:55:34.400
Rug Joke.
You guys ever see the movie punchline?

945
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.380
And he was talking about going into buy a carpet and there was the,
uh,

946
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.930
the immigrant guy in there and I don't know what the fuck he was,

947
00:55:40.931 --> 00:55:45.790
but he's talking about how when he said area rug,
he said he did.

948
00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.670
He just opened his mouth and he didn't form any syllable.

949
00:55:48.671 --> 00:55:53.590
I'm butchering the joke and then he goes,
uh,
yeah,
hey,
you know,
I want a,

950
00:55:53.591 --> 00:55:58.000
uh,
I want,
I need to buy a carpet and not a big thing.
Just sort of a small,

951
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:01.030
you know,
little sectional thing,
a little carpet kind of thing.

952
00:56:01.031 --> 00:56:03.760
And the guy goes to,
you don't want to cop it.

953
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.170
You want an ad

954
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.160
area rug,
whatever.
You got to see him do it.
It's fucking tons.

955
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:16.840
Literally doing the wave he played was in,
um,
it was the pizza guy.

956
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:18.190
Fast Times at Ridgemont high.

957
00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.013
<v 0>MMM.</v>

958
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:25.200
<v 1>He was in,
uh,
was it fast money or something like that?
The fuck was it?</v>

959
00:56:25.201 --> 00:56:27.900
The Rodney Dangerfield one,
whatever.
Just an absolutely brilliant guy.

960
00:56:27.901 --> 00:56:31.650
A true fucking artist,
unfortunately passed away of cancer at 57.

961
00:56:31.651 --> 00:56:34.870
So a shout out to him,
Taylor Negron,
uh,

962
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.330
going youtube watches videos,
watch his movies,
tell people about them.
Um,

963
00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:43.860
just an amazing,
amazing artist.
And Eddie Brill,
by the way on Facebook,

964
00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.920
was really good friends with them and uh,

965
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:51.340
wrote a way more better tribute then I just tried to give him,
um,
so anyways,

966
00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:54.790
let's go back here.
Let's go back here.
To the fucking

967
00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.760
do this podcast.

968
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:02.200
Sounds like you remember that SNL sketch at Alec Baldwin did,

969
00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.380
where they made fun of,
uh,

970
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.560
what does it NPR and they talked about schweddy balls.
That's been my tone,

971
00:57:09.561 --> 00:57:10.880
this entire fucking podcast.

972
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.400
I'll make it up next week when I can actually scream and yell here.

973
00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.860
Why the fuck do I get the sunny smiley face again?
Why does it keep doing that?

974
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.273
<v 0>MMM.</v>

975
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:25.610
<v 1>By the way,
guys,
I really got to work on my fucking temper.
I really do.</v>

976
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:29.880
I get into a fucking argument with my wife,
right?

977
00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.960
And she fucking wrote me.

978
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:36.910
I've never seen this before.

979
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:41.940
It was like a text message that was as long as the Gettysburg address about all

980
00:57:42.401 --> 00:57:45.930
the things that I was doing wrong.
Okay.

981
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:49.050
Reams of information about what I was doing wrong.

982
00:57:49.051 --> 00:57:51.240
And I gotta be honest with you.
I couldn't argue with any of it.

983
00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.530
If anybody knows away,

984
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.030
then I can stop flipping out over little things and no,

985
00:58:02.031 --> 00:58:05.030
this isn't going to hurt my fucking act because I'll still have the thought and

986
00:58:05.031 --> 00:58:08.810
I'll be able to go off and a comedic way on stage.

987
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:13.420
If anybody knows a good way to do it.
I sat down,

988
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.720
I thought about all the fucking

989
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:21.620
dumb things that made me flip out yesterday when I sat down and I was watching,

990
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:28.370
I was watching 60 minutes and they was showing wounded veterans of the Iraqi

991
00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.330
war.
This one guy like lost both his legs below the knee,
lost a thumb,

992
00:58:33.331 --> 00:58:38.331
a chunk of his fucking left arm and his left eye and he's being positive and

993
00:58:38.761 --> 00:58:40.620
he's fucking,
you know,

994
00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.860
going up this hill like Jerry Rice would run up and I'm sitting here flipping

995
00:58:43.861 --> 00:58:47.580
out because fucking people leave too much space and traffic.

996
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:54.220
I swear to God man.
Like I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know how to beat it.

997
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:59.940
I got,
I have the shortest.
Remember those fucking what?

998
00:58:59.941 --> 00:59:01.220
What color were the firecrackers?

999
00:59:01.221 --> 00:59:04.880
Was it the black ones that had the really short wick that you literally had to

1000
00:59:04.881 --> 00:59:07.790
be throwing them as you will lighting them like that is my temper.

1001
00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:10.820
Like I have such a bad fucking temper at this point.

1002
00:59:10.821 --> 00:59:13.610
Like now when I drive in the car,
I let my wife drive.

1003
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:17.900
Like some guy who's got his fucking balls in her purse.

1004
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.970
I just do it to keep the peace because if I'm riding in the car,

1005
00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:25.500
I don't flip out as much as when I'm driving.

1006
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1007
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:28.530
<v 1>Uh,
I just,
I don't know.</v>

1008
00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:32.160
Do you realize how ridiculous it is that I'm an angry man in a Prius?

1009
00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:38.100
How dumb is that in the sound of my horn as I'm screaming and yelling at people?

1010
00:59:38.101 --> 00:59:42.840
How fucking ridiculous I look and the fact that I know I looked at ridiculous,

1011
00:59:42.841 --> 00:59:45.270
I still can't stop doing it.
Like it is a real,

1012
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:51.020
it's a real fucking problem.
I don't know.

1013
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:55.730
I can't tell if I learned it from the people around me or if he just born and

1014
00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:58.910
angry fucking maniac,
but a,

1015
00:59:58.911 --> 01:00:03.911
it's a battle I've been fighting for the last 15 years of my adult life and I

1016
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:05.323
have,

1017
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:09.770
I don't think I've moved an inch forward other than just being able to admit it.

1018
01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:14.670
I have a fucking major God damn problem with my temper.
Like,

1019
01:00:14.671 --> 01:00:17.790
do you realize how fucking mad I got yesterday?
What that Dez Bryant catch?

1020
01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:20.400
I mean,
I talked about it for the first 20 minutes of the podcast.

1021
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:22.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1022
01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:27.280
<v 1>Who gives a fuck bill?
It's not your team.
You don't have any money on the game.</v>

1023
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.720
Why do I give a fuck?

1024
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:34.610
Why is it then anger me when the guy comes on the TV to explain it and

1025
01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:39.010
immediately looking on this guy sucked in gym class.
You fucking suck.

1026
01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:42.490
Fuck him yelling at the TV.
Fuck you.
You can't even catch a football.

1027
01:00:42.491 --> 01:00:45.070
You fucking pussy maniac.

1028
01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.620
I'm in a fucking hotel room and I'm getting no,

1029
01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.480
the people on your side of the wall can hear me.
Okay.

1030
01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1031
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:55.980
<v 1>How long am I going to continue to fucking embarrass myself?
Like,</v>

1032
01:00:55.981 --> 01:00:56.371
do you know what?

1033
01:00:56.371 --> 01:01:01.270
My wife can't even watch fucking TV with me because I won't shut the fuck up and

1034
01:01:01.271 --> 01:01:03.170
something bugs me every three seconds and I,

1035
01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.090
and I start yelling at the TV like it's a person in the room.

1036
01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:08.950
<v 0>I swear to God,</v>

1037
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.691
<v 1>I swear to God,
I,</v>

1038
01:01:10.691 --> 01:01:13.640
I sh I should have bought a house with a room over the garage and I should be

1039
01:01:13.641 --> 01:01:18.080
like sent there,
you know,
like an inmate.

1040
01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:21.200
Then every once in a while you let me out and you walk me around the front yard

1041
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:25.010
until I start getting heated about some dumb bullshit.
You know

1042
01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.030
that somebody came by with a Doggie poop bag and put it in my recycled trashcan.

1043
01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:35.380
Doesn't go with the blue one goes in the black one.

1044
01:01:35.381 --> 01:01:39.010
Just a moron to embarrass him.
Anyways,
a bill.

1045
01:01:39.011 --> 01:01:42.490
Can I bounce back from bad first time at sex?

1046
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:43.930
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1047
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:44.511
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

1048
01:01:44.511 --> 01:01:47.890
And that's supposed to be good the first time he's supposed to be so freaked out

1049
01:01:47.891 --> 01:01:52.480
that you're doing.
If that you,
you're the game's over before it even start.
Right?

1050
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.880
Hello,
Mr. Byrd,
huge fan from Poland.
I'm not a virgin by the way.

1051
01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:00.280
Here's the story.
Uh,

1052
01:02:00.281 --> 01:02:04.420
been hanging out with his girl for about a year as friends.

1053
01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.280
Well,
right now,
dude,

1054
01:02:06.281 --> 01:02:09.790
the fact that if you actually bang this person have to be in France for a

1055
01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:10.623
fucking year,

1056
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:12.103
<v 0>you know,</v>

1057
01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.330
<v 1>how did you even maintain an erection?</v>

1058
01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:19.300
Because all those memories of walking around a farmer's market.
Anyways,

1059
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.820
finally I ended up falling for her,
but she put me in the friend zone.
Well,

1060
01:02:22.821 --> 01:02:23.840
I wasn't having that.

1061
01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:27.650
So I sort of pumped the brakes on the whole thing and stopped hanging out with

1062
01:02:27.651 --> 01:02:30.410
her textbook textbook.
Nice move.

1063
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:34.340
Just some messages from time to time.
A few weeks ago,

1064
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.780
she calls me up randomly to chill at my place after not seeing each other for a

1065
01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.570
couple of months.
I was kind of buzz,
so I thought,
what the hell?
Why not?

1066
01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:44.390
So she comes over,
we have some alcohol,

1067
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.800
maybe some illegal substances and everything was cool.
Suddenly she just goes,

1068
01:02:48.801 --> 01:02:49.634
fuck me.

1069
01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.060
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1070
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:55.620
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I got to get over to Poland.
Um,
so I lifted up her skirt,</v>

1071
01:02:55.621 --> 01:02:57.140
ripped off a Petty's Jesus' body.

1072
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:59.940
His guys going blow by blow and started plowing her.

1073
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.000
Unfortunately I got the whiskey Dick soon after.
Fuck my life.
It was pathetic.

1074
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.320
I ended up,
oh Jesus.
Okay.
He performed oral sex.
I got to tone this down here.

1075
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:12.780
Performed oral sex on her.

1076
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:16.320
She got where she needed to be,

1077
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:19.960
but this was not the,

1078
01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.160
the railing she was probably hoping for.
I wanted to kill myself and still do.

1079
01:03:25.161 --> 01:03:25.941
We still talk,

1080
01:03:25.941 --> 01:03:30.941
but I'm not sure if we'll ever get a chance to get into her pants again.

1081
01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.090
Please come from me,
Mr. Byrd,
and tell me that it's going to be okay.

1082
01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:39.740
Also exclusive.
Excuse my English.
It's not my first language.
Well,

1083
01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:45.290
you spoke meathead English perfectly.
Um,

1084
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:50.480
listen to whose kid note the way you talk about this woman getting her panties.

1085
01:03:50.481 --> 01:03:54.170
Plower,
railer and all that.
You don't,
you don't love this woman.

1086
01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:55.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1087
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.850
<v 1>You just want someone you can fuck.
So whatever,
you know,
it didn't work out.</v>

1088
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.750
Move on to somebody else.
I think you're going to be fine.
Um,

1089
01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.690
you did make up for you.
Mistake with the very courteous move afterwards.

1090
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:13.490
I don't think she'd be that upset.
Um,
listen,

1091
01:04:13.491 --> 01:04:16.910
she's probably sitting at home going,
did I say fuck me to that guy?

1092
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.840
Did I really just say that?
Oh God.
And then his dick went down.

1093
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:23.660
Was he not turned on by me?
She's probably doing all of that shit.

1094
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.133
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1095
01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.570
<v 1>I dunno.
The more I talk about this,
I think you guys both deserve each other.</v>

1096
01:04:28.571 --> 01:04:33.540
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe you get back in there.
Whiskey.
Dick,
you gotta,

1097
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:37.080
you gotta we know you get whiskey.
Dick,
you gotta get yourself in the Ma,
uh,

1098
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.670
the same mindset of a relief pitcher that just gave up with the fucking,

1099
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:45.800
the deep ball,
you know,
but you still up or run,

1100
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:51.000
you just got to forget about that.
Just like Roger Clemens did.
You know,

1101
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:55.080
he would just immediately just,
you know,
start asking for another ball.

1102
01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:00.390
Does that make any fucking sense?
Actually,
when I was thinking about that now,

1103
01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:02.780
and I use Roger Clemens as a,
as an example,

1104
01:05:02.781 --> 01:05:07.490
all of a sudden they had a different vibe to it.
Anyways,

1105
01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:11.180
sorry about that.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
This fucking podcast was an absolute shit show.

1106
01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:11.911
Well this,

1107
01:05:11.911 --> 01:05:16.911
this ends the whispering podcast from a hotel room somewhere in New Orleans for

1108
01:05:19.051 --> 01:05:23.550
the week of a,
what the fuck week is it here?
Oh,

1109
01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.130
Monday,
January 12th phone.

1110
01:05:25.131 --> 01:05:28.300
And make sure I got that rife cause last week like an asshole.
I said June,
uh,

1111
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.900
June 5th.
I'm moron.
All right.
Anyways,
that's a podcast for this week.

1112
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:35.350
Uh,

1113
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:39.280
I promise you I will make up for all the yelling I didn't do this week on next

1114
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.730
week's podcast.
Thank you for listening.
Um,

1115
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.400
anything I got to plug,
nothing.

1116
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:49.090
I got nothing to plug other than I'm going to be going to Australia,
New Zealand,

1117
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:54.880
Singapore,
Hong Kong and Mumbai.
That's definitely going down.

1118
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:59.530
And also the southern bus tour in May is definitely happening.

1119
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.430
Um,
I'm talking to my agent.
Today's going to give me all the dates.

1120
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.460
I've already heard some of the areas that I'm going to be going to.

1121
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:12.670
Shreveport,
Louisiana I think is in there.
Savannah,
Georgia.

1122
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.890
Um,
I think I'm going to be going back to Charleston,
North Carolina,

1123
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.450
South Carolina.
It's,
it's going to be,
it's going to be insane.

1124
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:26.110
And um,
as far as I know,

1125
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:31.111
I think we started in Kentucky and we end in New Orleans and we're going to all

1126
01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:34.420
these off,
be off the beaten path kinds of things.
You know,

1127
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.480
not the major cities that I've already played.
Nashville,
Atlanta,

1128
01:06:37.481 --> 01:06:40.780
I've already done those ones,
so it's got to be fucking awesome.

1129
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.400
And also the week of shows at the Wilbur Theater in Boston.

1130
01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.810
I'm doing an entire week,
Monday through Sunday of shows that the Wilbur Theater,

1131
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:52.060
uh,
they've been selling great.
Um,

1132
01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:55.870
and I think we're going to start adding some shows and um,

1133
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:57.970
I think that that's something that I'm going to do wherever you go.
The year.

1134
01:06:57.971 --> 01:07:00.640
I think I'll just do a week of shows in my hometown,

1135
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.360
eat all that fucking Chinese food and all this shit that I missed.

1136
01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:09.010
Kelly's Roseby fucking slices of pizza and all that type of all that fucking

1137
01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:13.080
food.
You Steve when I was 22,
but I shouldn't be eating now.
Um,

1138
01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.630
but whatever.
All right.
Predictions next week,

1139
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:22.290
patriots eked out a victory against the colts and then I think Seattle,

1140
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:26.980
um,
we'll have a tough game against the packers.

1141
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:30.580
I think the ball's going to be great games.
Seattle wins.

1142
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:35.640
And then for some dumb reason,
when we go to the Superbowl,

1143
01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:40.060
the Patriots might actually be even or favored.

1144
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:45.180
And that's only because of morons in Vegas who just can't lay off of Brady and

1145
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:47.710
Belichick.
So that's really Vegas.

1146
01:07:47.711 --> 01:07:51.010
Just trying to get money on both sides of the ball.
Um,

1147
01:07:51.011 --> 01:07:54.550
it really has nothing to do with the fact.
And then I think that we will be,

1148
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.440
um,
I wouldn't say manhandled by Seattle,
but we will be handled.

1149
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:05.050
Um,
cause I just think it kills me to say that as a patriots fan,
but I'm just,

1150
01:08:05.051 --> 01:08:08.980
I'm being totally bumping,
fucking brutally honest about football this week.

1151
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:13.070
The tuck rule is fucking stupid and I think Seattle's going to win the goddamn

1152
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:15.260
Superbowl.
I hope that we win it.

1153
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.530
If anybody could figure out how to beat those guys,

1154
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.780
it will be a Belichick's game plan.
It's just,
I,
uh,
I dunno,

1155
01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:26.720
I just don't know what their defense in the fact that we can't get any fucking

1156
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:28.010
pressure on the quarterback.
I don't know.

1157
01:08:28.011 --> 01:08:30.680
How the fuck are you going to be Seattle doing that and the fact that Wilson can

1158
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:35.660
run like a motherfucker too.
That's going to be a nightmare.
Um,

1159
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:39.080
so anyways,
there's my God damn prediction.
On the other hand,

1160
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:43.220
I hope that we actually beat them.
That would be phenomenal.

1161
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.050
And uh,
I don't even hate to see hooks.
I don't,

1162
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:49.100
I just,

1163
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:54.100
I just hate how the NFL panders to anybody who dresses up like a fucking mime or

1164
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:58.760
the tin man with spikes coming out of your shoulders and they never showed the

1165
01:08:58.761 --> 01:08:59.594
real fence.

1166
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.410
I just deal with the fucking people who were at the Kingdom who were at Sullivan

1167
01:09:03.411 --> 01:09:06.200
state and then have a show them,
they always get to show some fucking jerk off,

1168
01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:12.120
you know,
dressed like Sam Adams.
I had it fucking drives me up the wall.

1169
01:09:12.121 --> 01:09:15.080
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.
So I supplied cast for this week.
Uh,

1170
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:16.880
I'll talk to you next week.
Thank you for listening.
