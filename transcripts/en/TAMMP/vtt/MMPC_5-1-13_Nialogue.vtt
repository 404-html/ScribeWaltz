00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.640
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:07.641
It's bill burr and it's time for a very special episode of the Monday morning

3
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:13.230
podcast.
Our little offshoot,
a little spinoff like back in the day,

4
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:17.730
you know when somebody would guest star like Mork on happy days and they would

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.810
just be like,
who is that fucking guy?
The studio audience loved him.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.230
We should give that person their own show.
Well,

7
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:30.231
you know what dreams really do happen in Hollywood and they also have in the

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:34.210
podcasting world because our own Nia,

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.730
our own beautiful,
lovely near,

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.990
we're doing a Nia log because because you're,

11
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:44.610
you're fucking podcast room is still gutted because we're waiting for the

12
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:45.840
mortgage company.
Right.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.380
Because they took our money away because they didn't trust that we were going to

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.570
get the money from the insurance and then the mortgage company had to take the

15
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.650
money.
That's right.

16
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.020
Because they want to make sure that we were actually going to put into the house

17
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:02.600
so we can go down to the fucking and distributing ihops cock suckers.
Yeah.

18
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.380
All right,
well this is,
but it's been a good night night.
Nia.

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.210
I know you don't watch sports,
but the,
uh,
I,
I mentioned,

20
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.280
I mentioned on the podcast that the Celtics have fucking hot.

21
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.370
We're old.
We're an old ass team.
Last year,
what the Celtics did last year,

22
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.300
taking the heat to seven games was,
was incredible,
man.
I was just like,

23
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.450
these guys are winning like games.
They should not be winning.

24
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:32.190
Just fucking desire.
All right,
and now this year I'm like,

25
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:36.510
all right,
we lost a old twinkle toes there,
whatever the fuck his name is.

26
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.870
I'm not a big basketball guy.
We will,
we lost them down to Miami.
I'm like,

27
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:44.280
now we're really fucking old and that we get Jason Terry and replacement and

28
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.440
then fucking Rondo goes down.
I'm like,
we're finished.

29
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:49.560
We're going to get pounded by the Knicks and the next go up three games to none.

30
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.070
You have to win four out of seven.
So if you went four in a row,

31
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.000
you get swept and we get swept.
That means one,
one thing.

32
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.950
Your team is a bunch of bitches.
It's not true,

33
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:02.970
but that's what people say.

34
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.060
So like right now there's a lot of like Laker fans right now that are probably

35
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.910
feeling that.
And I feel sorry for that.
You know,

36
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.670
people would probably say that about their team and it's not true.

37
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.990
Do you feel sorry for them?

38
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.470
They're probably being called a bunch of swept bitches and,

39
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.990
and a lot of love was shown to Boston over the last few weeks.

40
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:24.630
So I'm going to show a little love to the Laker fans and say Ya,

41
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:27.840
you know I feel bad for you.
Okay.

42
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.730
And if I could somehow get you a coupon and go get you some botox.
Oh yes.

43
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.360
So patronized so nobody could see your brow.
Furrowing I would fucking do it.

44
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.390
I do it in a second.
So the Celtics win one game,

45
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.790
cause we're the fucking Celtics and you don't sweep us love when somebody talks

46
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:45.720
shit after the victory.
Who doesn't even watched the sport?

47
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.850
Now I'm standing up now.

48
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.430
It's supposed to be the near log when I got to get this shit and now we'd

49
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.040
fucking beat the Knicks again.
It's three games to two.

50
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.840
We beat him in the fucking allegedly Mecca,
whatever the fuck that means.

51
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.510
I remember it's a gathering place for people to come and beat the fucking Knicks

52
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.760
beat to Nick's.
We beat him again.

53
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.110
Now it's two to three fucking boss.

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.570
Your big forehead is sweaty.
Yes.
Cause I was just,

55
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.250
cause I just worked out because I just worked out sweat again.
I work out.

56
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.600
I Dunno.
I don't think,
I just don't think we've got enough to beat those guys.

57
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.010
But like just the fact that,
you know,

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.210
we're making them nervous because we fucking came back against those God Damn

59
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.210
Yankees.
Oh yes we did.
They were up three games to none.
That's when we first met.

60
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.420
Remember that came back four games straight.

61
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.960
We do that to that base baseball team and then the basketball team's fucking

62
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:39.400
tremendous.
All right.
This is a Neil Ogg.
Everybody,
you never fucking know it.

63
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.620
That's three minutes a shit talking all the lunch bunch of women right now
going,

64
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.210
oh my God,
just shut up and let her talk,
including me.
Oh Gee.
Ooh.

65
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.830
Wasn't that a little too shea fucking tone cooling leave.
Hmm.
All right,

66
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:56.650
let's get right down to it and I'll let ya on Monday's podcast,

67
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.330
I was talking about the,
uh,
which is really a fucking old story at this point,

68
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:06.310
maybe is the first,
uh,
uh,
basketball player,

69
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.950
athlete,
whatever,
to come out and say that,
that,

70
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:13.270
that he was gay and actually Martina Navratilova and said,
ah,
just to God,

71
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.880
they a minute.
Got their minute.

72
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.040
I came out in the 80s when they could yell homophobic stuff.
Me Add a while.

73
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.400
They sold Cheerios,
been a couple others,
mostly women.

74
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.560
There was a woman on the Mba who came out as well,

75
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.540
but this women don't play in the NBA.

76
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.960
This is she grabbing towels for the men that play in that league.
The WNBL.

77
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.260
Oh,
that doesn't count up.
Really.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait.

78
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.990
A lame name,
one team and the WNB.

79
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.710
Okay.
Name.
That doesn't mean that that's not valid.

80
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:50.470
Just because I can't name it Colorado cleavage.

81
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.660
They've won the first six years.
Um,

82
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.360
that's not true.
No,
but it just,
cause I can name that doesn't mean anything,

83
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:03.750
but I'm not as Memphis anyway.

84
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.070
Straters the Memphis mess.

85
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.110
I can't name as the,
there's the La sparks,
there's the,
uh,

86
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.370
professional athletes who have come out.
So he's not necessarily the first,

87
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:22.450
but he's the first because it's the NBA.
So what are you saying?
What do you,

88
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:26.230
what do you think about it?
Should he have shitty of kept his,
uh,

89
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.580
his little lungs?

90
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.160
Dillydallying Deli's I'm trying to say it without cursing.
No,

91
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:36.250
I think it's great that he came out.
It's a,
it's a big deal for,

92
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.780
for the sports world now,

93
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.790
especially at the NBA and the NFL will follow suit.
Maybe not right away,

94
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:46.840
but soon.
I have always said I wanted it to be the most manly,

95
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.440
the dude that all the homophobic guys,
not all.

96
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.640
And I never even sports bars homophobe but there's a lot of the ones who already

97
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:59.360
have his Jersey and I want them to be wearing it.
Who,
who would that be though?

98
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.170
What the most manliest do?
Doing the NFL or NFL or NBA?

99
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.270
I was talking NFL.
Well,
who's the most manliest aren't they all pretty manly?

100
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.870
Well,
if I had my choice,
if I,

101
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.270
I've always been a fan of beards.
Um,
no,

102
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:18.980
Tom Brady's not considered the most manliest guy.

103
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:21.140
Everybody calls him a pretty boy.
Who would it be?

104
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.930
I just want to one of those sexual,
just one of those fucking,

105
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:25.370
you know what I mean?
One of those fucking guys,

106
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:26.720
and I'm just trying to get to the joke here.

107
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.280
[inaudible] going to be standing there in the fucking sports that Jersey on

108
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.790
right now.

109
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.700
They're going to look like his girlfriend was there wearing his jersey.

110
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.790
Why would they look like his girl little boyfriend?
You know what I mean?

111
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.830
Because in high school when you date all the ladies when they were banging the

112
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.570
quarterback,
whoever was bang and it got,

113
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.840
got to walk around wearing his jacket and they pull the sleeves up like an

114
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.900
eighties comic.
And that's what I was trying to fucking get to.

115
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.350
But this isn't about me,
although it has been for fucking seven minutes.

116
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.230
Here's my thing.
I don't think it's any big deal,
but what,
what,

117
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.490
what about the showers?
What about,

118
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:05.420
should she be allowed to go into the showers?

119
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.670
I said I
allowed to,

120
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.700
if he didn't try to make any sort of moves,
he's not going to.

121
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:18.140
Now that such as like,
that's such a kneejerk fucking homophobic,

122
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:21.200
ridiculous reaction.
Oh God.
Now that I know that you're gay,

123
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.720
you're going to be looking at me.
You're going to want to try to rape me.

124
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:28.610
It's like if I didn't try to fucking,
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking no,

125
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.400
it isn't nonsense.
It is.

126
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:36.110
It's like this ridiculous reaction feeling like I'm not saying that he can't

127
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:37.990
fucking shot.
First of all,
why don't you,

128
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.840
all I did was I asked the fucking question and all you fucking jerk offs

129
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:45.890
immediately.
Just homophobic.
He should have to pay a cover charge.

130
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.490
Oh Jesus.
A Cup of charge.
All those shredded dudes,

131
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.060
fucking abs and all that.
Dick's down to the floor.

132
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:55.500
This is what the fuck is until we get to look at that for free.
That'd be like,

133
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.400
don't be like me fucking,

134
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.830
I get to shower like I come out and just say that what?

135
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.540
Just what if I came out and said I was gay?

136
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.150
Can I then go fucking shower with a bunch of Victoria's secret fucking that

137
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.780
doesn't make sense.
You wouldn't have before,
so yeah.
No,

138
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.600
I'm just saying you don't get to shower with the thing you want to fuck without

139
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.570
paying.
You got to take somebody to a dinner.
Oh,
it's how you're getting,

140
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.140
I'm fucking around for Christ.
Sake of fun.
You know what?

141
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.330
Something's going to chop that up and I'm going to have to make an apology,

142
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:24.164
but I don't have to.

143
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.940
Who am I going apologize to fucking fruit loops.com.

144
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:32.630
Who the hell do I have on this item in that I didn't mean that.

145
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.980
You know what it was?
I was trying not to say stamps.com Jesus.

146
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.370
I'm going to have to erase this fucking podcast.
You know it is fit.

147
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:41.450
Told you to watch that.

148
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.560
I told it to watch that go fruit loops is my go to product.

149
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.270
I already said Cheerios.
I always go with cereal.
You don't think so?

150
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.820
It's different now.
It's different.
Oh,
go fuck yourself.

151
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:57.330
I've said a long time ago how I feel about the gays in the community that they

152
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:00.730
live in,
which is what I think's a REIA there,
I think.

153
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.240
I think years from now they're going to look back on this and see that.

154
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.390
See the way gays were treated and they can look at it the same way as like when

155
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:08.310
you used to stone somebody cause they were a witch.

156
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.920
I'm just having fun with this shit.
Give me a break.

157
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.921
You don't think he's fucking psyched standing next to Colby who like God,

158
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.370
he's the best basketball player standing next to me.
You are ridiculous.

159
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.340
Why would he look?
He's been looking.

160
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.900
He's been looking.
All right.
Well here's the thing.
All right,
well what about,

161
00:09:31.901 --> 00:09:35.730
okay,
okay,
now we're getting somewhere.
So He's been looking hypothetically,

162
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.480
he's been looking,
but no,
no,
no.

163
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.720
Let me back into this corner for a second so we have a little fun.
Why am I here?

164
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.980
So He's been looking right now.
Let me ask you this.
If I'm standing around,

165
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.540
all right,
bunch of naked women and I'd been looking,
I'm called the creep.

166
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.990
Get out of this locker room.
You creepy.
Creepy.
It's like,

167
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:56.850
what you think I'm going to rape you?
I'm just looking at you.

168
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.950
A little Bush over there.
That's all I'm doing.
Smelly.
How come I can't do that?

169
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.680
How come I can't do that?
It's not the same.
Why can't I go shower with the lady?

170
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.490
How come I can't do that?
This is,
this is reverse.
Uh,

171
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.850
whatever it is.
If he gets to shower with the fellas,

172
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.260
probably alone now he knows how people feel.
Fuck.

173
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:23.370
Probably he'll probably purposefully separate himself because he doesn't want

174
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:25.550
people to feel uncomfortable.
No,
I think,
I think what?

175
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.110
I think what he did was great.
I'm just having a fun,

176
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.810
I'm just having fun out there who are actually taking this shit seriously.

177
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.180
You know?
I don't,
I don't know what to tell you.
You know?

178
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.020
I got to be honest with you.
I thought he did.
It was great.
That's great.

179
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.940
It took a lot of bulls.
It did.

180
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.510
It's like a lot of fucking balls to do to do what he did.

181
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.290
Especially when it seems like that's a sport where,
oh,
he's,

182
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.470
because he's got all those guys,
you know,

183
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:55.910
random tweets and other kinds of bullshit,
you know,
it's such a,
you know,

184
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.380
masculine.
All the,
the world of sports anyway,

185
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:01.170
when it comes to men's sports is seen as a very masculine,

186
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:04.380
you gotta be a certain kind of guy,
a tough guy,
a strong guy,

187
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:07.740
a guy that's not afraid of pain.
Who's going to go out there and just,
you know,

188
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.853
and Chris,

189
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.070
when Chris Bosh cried after they lost the championship,

190
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.330
he got a ton of shit for it.

191
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.490
He collapsed to the ground and cried it out when they want,
when they lost.
Oh,

192
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:24.950
and they lost.
Well,
yeah,
it's fucking the bad.
A lot into it right now.

193
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.170
He just said,
well,
you're a lot of emotion into it.
Why wouldn't you?
But yeah,

194
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:31.260
but because you cry,
you're seen as weak because we're guys,

195
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.130
what you supposed to do is take that ball of sadness and stick it next,

196
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.430
add it to the big ball of sadness in your chest.

197
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.210
One day you're out there with the hedge clippers.

198
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.730
When you're like 55 and he just dropped and that's it.
You guys cry it out,
right?

199
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.590
I heard you keep your memories and your chest.

200
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.370
So I know it's a wonderful thing that he did,

201
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.270
but it's one of those things where now these done,
it's amazing.

202
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.490
I need to read that sports illustrated article.

203
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:03.760
That's when he officially came out because it supposedly as a great article.

204
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.060
But I guess what people feel,
even though it's amazing,

205
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:10.210
and I don't think anyone is discounting him from it unless they're,
you know,

206
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.290
feel weird about an NBA player coming out is that while it's amazing and great,

207
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.790
they feel like it's going to take a quote unquote bigger star to really affect.

208
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.100
I thought that was annoying.
I thought that that was annoying.

209
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.530
That's what they stole.
That guy's fucking thunder.
Well,
he had the fucking balls.

210
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:32.440
You know what come out and I and absolutely.
But the thing is,

211
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:35.620
it's kind of like with AIDS,
right?
So everyone had a certain feeling about,

212
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:36.161
well this is,

213
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:40.480
I'm gonna make this parallel because it makes sense when when people were

214
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:43.930
talking about aids in the eighties and nineties there was a certain conception

215
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:47.830
of who got aids.
It was a gay man who was sleeping around or whatever it is.

216
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.120
But when Maddie Johnson a huge respected,
revered,

217
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.020
loved athlete,
straight,
not in Boston,

218
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.590
it doesn't matter when he came out that for a lot of people,

219
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.730
maybe not normalize it,
but put a face on it was sort of like,
wow,

220
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:09.280
this is a kind of person who could be susceptible.

221
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.150
So maybe it's not something outside of me and I don't know about this.

222
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:16.480
And that's those people that do those things that somebody like me,

223
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.770
a straight person who has a family,
but Bob who was careless,
this is,

224
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.750
you'll get aids.
And that's what changed for a lot of people that,

225
00:13:25.751 --> 00:13:30.070
that face of AIDS.
So it wasn't just gay guys sneaking around in the alley.

226
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.210
It became trust street guy.
Well yeah,

227
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:37.690
but it also became a straight,
very masculine,
like I said,

228
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:42.100
revered hero to a lot of people.
And so it's sort of like,
oh wow,

229
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.810
we're all vulnerable if we're not careful.
Careful.
So what people are saying is,

230
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.570
even though I,
I get it,
I'm listening to you.

231
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.320
So even though Jason Collins coming out is a huge thing and no one should

232
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:56.530
discount it,
there are people who think,
wow,
that's amazing.

233
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.820
They need a straight guy.
It was a huge [inaudible] that would maybe affect,

234
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.580
if it was a Colby and Colby blind.
I have his fucking moment.
It was his moment.

235
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.350
Absolutely had the balls to do it and then fucking the twinkle toes.net has to

236
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.420
come out and be like,
well actually we'll cut.
That was good,

237
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.480
but we want somebody more high profile this fucking asshole.

238
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.440
But that's not what they're saying.
They're not taking it away from him,

239
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:21.820
but they're just,
but no,

240
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:25.920
but that's selfish fucking agenda that they want something more.
No,

241
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.350
they're looking at it as well,
this is wonderful.
I wonder though,

242
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:33.430
if this is really going to have the impacts on the sports,

243
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.870
can I get a word in for that?
And something like a magic Johnson would have.

244
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.240
That's,
that's,
that's all they're sending.

245
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.470
No one's taking anything away from them.

246
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.880
They just don't know if that's going to erase quote unquote homophobia from the

247
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:50.230
sports world because it's not somebody like a,
a shack or a,
you know,

248
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.230
I haven't gotten that,
you know,
whatever.
Now let me that,

249
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.990
let's say you win an Oscar.
Okay?

250
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.750
You win an Oscar and then some women's group comes up,

251
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.050
right as the handing you that fucking trophy,
they go,
you know,

252
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:07.400
this is all well and good,
but now do you feel like you got your moment?
Well,
no,

253
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:12.390
I wouldn't feel that.
Thank you.
Defense rest.
But I'm not,

254
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.850
I'm saying it was let's,
it's a valid perspective,
but it's not taking,

255
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:21.500
it's not taking anything away from him,
but I mean,
I,
can I give the guy a week?

256
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.470
Can he have a week?

257
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.790
You're saying because anytime anyone makes a big announcement like this,

258
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.750
there's the people who feel that he's a hero and then there's the naysayers.

259
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.820
He's not a person to them.
He has this thing.

260
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:34.550
He's this thing to throw against the wall to continue.
Fuck,

261
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.150
give the guy his fucking weak.
He had the balls to come out.

262
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.150
This is his fucking week and he ought to be hit,
but you know,

263
00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:45.280
he finally gets the shit off his chest.
He can finally just,
you know,
relax,
build,

264
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:45.511
fuck.

265
00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:49.610
Fucking is not have to worry about somebody saying something and whatever the

266
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:53.570
fuck it is that you have to go through that horrific fucking life that you

267
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:54.560
shouldn't have to go through.

268
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:58.820
She ought to be able to just be who the fuck you are and to just after he

269
00:15:58.821 --> 00:16:01.490
fucking,
the second he comes out,
they had these douchebags be like,
you know,

270
00:16:01.491 --> 00:16:02.480
that's all well and good.

271
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.890
He should have taken his big fucking hand and mushed their faces back behind the

272
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:09.860
curtain for a second.
Anything bad by it.
I think they're just,

273
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.540
they're being very realistic about the world that we live in and the reality of

274
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:18.560
it is,
while you've got somebody who's done a very brave,
awesome thing,

275
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.100
sometimes it takes a bigger celebrity or whatever to making away from him.

276
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.280
Can he have this fucking week is all I'm saying?
No,
I know.

277
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:31.550
I get what you're saying,
but they also have a valid point.
I mean,

278
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:36.551
do you think Jason Collins coming out is really going to affect the way we'll

279
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.890
see driving me up the fucking wall right now?
Not Listening to me.
No,

280
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.030
because I said like five minutes ago,
I said,

281
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:47.120
if you won an Oscar and as you wanted some woman's group when I'm,
you know,

282
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:49.420
this is all well and good,
but blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

283
00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:52.650
Blah and stole your thunder,
you would be pissed.
And you,

284
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.800
and you believe that women should continue to be advanced,

285
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:56.600
but can you have your fucking moment?

286
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.690
I think that they robbed the guy didn't happen,

287
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:03.980
but I think by them saying shit like that,
I think it's a,
it's a,

288
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.820
it's,
what's the word?
Not Crass.
It's no,

289
00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.750
I understand what you're saying,
but not a classy fucking thing,

290
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.100
but give the guy a couple of days,

291
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.530
this man Jason Collins coming out at the time he was coming out at this point in

292
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:21.380
his career with his standing in the NBA.

293
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.800
Do you think that it's going to seriously impact the way people see gaze and

294
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.790
professional sports like basketball or football,
et cetera?
Do you realize?

295
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.790
I gotta be honest with you like,
Oh wow,
I can't speak.

296
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.830
I can't speak for other people.
But that's,
but that's the question.
Can I,

297
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.930
can I answer the question is,
here's the thing.

298
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.320
You said all that shit about Magic Johnson and this put a face on it and blah,

299
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:48.290
blah,
blah,
blah.
That is the,

300
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.720
that is the legend now that it's happened the same way.

301
00:17:52.721 --> 00:17:56.010
Like when Nirvana's nevermind came out,
everybody's like,

302
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.940
you just knew the second you heard it.
There was a change in the air.

303
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.710
That's all fucking,
that's the legend.
And I've always said that.

304
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:08.490
I heard it,
I didn't get it.
And I was waiting for the next skid row album.

305
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.350
I didn't get,
I didn't get fucking Nevada.
I,
I wasn't old.

306
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.040
I was,
I was starting to become old.
Like my,

307
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.450
like my generation was being passed on.
Like I was not grunge,

308
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:22.050
I was fucking metal.
So I didn't get them.

309
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:24.900
And how great the musicians they were until they did their unplugged.

310
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.420
And I was like,
wow,
these guys,
and they did all these covers and shit.

311
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.810
And then I worked my way back and as I worked my way back to the whole thing was

312
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:35.760
over when Kurt killed himself.
But that whole Magic Johnson thing was,

313
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:40.380
first thing people said was,
he's gay,
he's gay.
And all this shit came out.

314
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:43.790
Oh look at him kissing Isaiah and the cheek before the finals.
All right there.

315
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.250
There you go.
That up.
They said that shit.
And then when they,

316
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.620
if people who,
like
we're saying no,

317
00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:55.410
no,
magic is still straight than what they just said.
Well as well,

318
00:18:55.411 --> 00:19:00.270
I'm not Magic Johnson,
I'm not fucking six women at a time.
I'm fine.
So,

319
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.360
and I think that's what most people do because it's scary that you're looking at

320
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.670
something that could kill you and your thinking in the back of your head.

321
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.690
All these skanks you banged without a condom,
you know,
laying there in bed going,

322
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:14.680
this could have me too.
There's,

323
00:19:14.681 --> 00:19:18.630
that takes a certain level of fucking maturity that most people don't have.

324
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.910
Especially when you're younger,
you think the,

325
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.830
the appreciation for Jason Collins,
even though he's getting so many accolades,

326
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.690
the g the real appreciation is not going to come until later.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

327
00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:34.680
no,
no.
What I was saying is what that whatever that fucking website was,

328
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.580
I thought it was uncool that they said this is great,
but you know,

329
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:40.720
this is all well and good,
but I think that I thought they'll run in moment.

330
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.390
I think it's fucking phenomenal debt.

331
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:47.391
He did it and I hope more people do it and everybody just fucking relaxes and

332
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:52.710
it's no big deal.
Right.
Well I think that's,
that's absolutely 100% true,

333
00:19:52.711 --> 00:19:56.340
but I think they were just sort of has any Lisbon funny that sounds like a

334
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.510
fucking town meeting.

335
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.570
There's this being realistic about what the impact to be and no one can really

336
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:07.380
know.
And so I don't know,
a month,
a year,
three years from now,

337
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.590
how come they won't interview anybody who doesn't give a fuck?
Like me,

338
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.910
I could give a fee gift.

339
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.190
I could give a flying hair that's not in fuck about what you do.

340
00:20:17.191 --> 00:20:22.140
Off The court unless,
unless,
unless you're killing people.

341
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.020
No,
I don't care.
I don't care how now you don't care.
No,
no.
I'd like to read.

342
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.910
I don't care
what we already discussed it then we got so,

343
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.450
okay,
but let's actually bring some sort of comedy to the,
okay.

344
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.660
You got really mad at me last night
before we went to bed.

345
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:45.630
I'm not going to say who I was looking at either.
All right.
Yeah.

346
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.250
That of protection.
This is what happened to me.

347
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.600
He is fucking on her side trying to go to sleep and I got the laptop and I start

348
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:58.900
doing the IMD thing and I'm looking and I'm looking and I'm looking.
Yeah,

349
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:03.760
she doesn't believe this.
So I find,
I find some style it right.

350
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.740
And it says that,
you know,
she did a spread in playboy,

351
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.100
so I'm like,
Oh really?
Wow.
I want to see a naked.

352
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.460
So I go to click on images.
I swear to God,

353
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.480
I'm on Google images and some,

354
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.670
the second I clicked on one of the naked pictures,

355
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.760
this other window came up with somebody talking who?

356
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:26.020
I don't remember what they were saying,

357
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.140
but you immediately assumed that I was watching porn.

358
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.930
Cause when you click on a porn,
that window that opens up behind the window,

359
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:38.470
those girls on the Webcams,
they pop up in their leg.
Hey Daddy.
No they don't.

360
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:40.750
They usually papa.
I

361
00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.010
said first time you hear it,

362
00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.320
like where's that voice coming from that somebody hacked into my computer and

363
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.700
they're mocking the porn that I'm watching.
And then you go,
it's just,

364
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.370
oh there's some fucking housewives sitting there with a pickle.
Um,

365
00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.200
a couple of kids running around the background.
It's tough economy.
God.

366
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.870
So she immediately assumed that I was watching porno and I was like,
I wasn't.

367
00:22:02.871 --> 00:22:05.500
And I literally backtracked through the fucking thing.

368
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.250
I backtraced it and I showed you what I was watching and then he called you a

369
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:12.790
fucking scumbag fucking scumbag piece of shit.

370
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.980
And I never,
it is.
It's like you're watching porn too.

371
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:22.000
If you know that that happens,
but that right then,

372
00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.360
but I'm not watching it fucking line next to in bed you dirt bag,

373
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:31.080
which you worry if know if he even to look at naked ladies on a computer naked

374
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.090
in bed.
Ladies.
Well lying in bed.

375
00:22:35.091 --> 00:22:39.920
So whether you're watching porn or not,
I still stand by those harsh words.

376
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.880
Artistic.
They don't show the clam there.

377
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.240
They just show a nice little La,
you know?
Yeah.

378
00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:52.840
And I heard that pop up in that breathy little,
oh my God,

379
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:57.040
this and that and hey and I knew what you were doing and I fucking screamed at

380
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:57.874
you.

381
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.190
You fucking deserve my next to me it'd be looking at porno while in bed with

382
00:23:03.191 --> 00:23:07.300
your future wife.
You fucking scumbag.
I don't take any of it back.

383
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.150
You're a dirt bag and you deserve

384
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.550
to be yelled at in life and on the pot.
Money is,

385
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.080
we got such a great mattress here that I think I could actually rub one out

386
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.200
without you noticing.
That's nice.
That's what they should do.

387
00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:24.940
That's what they should do in that commercial.
You know that commercial,

388
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.660
they have the wine on one side and the guys jumping up and down.

389
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.800
They should have some guy with his hand inside his fucking jam jams fucking

390
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:35.400
shark and like this and looking at the camera.
Given the thumbs up,

391
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.610
you just say you just see the bedspread fucking,
yeah.
So yeah,

392
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.840
so that's what you think I was doing.

393
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.600
That's that is what you were and maybe you weren't looking at actual
pornography.

394
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.210
Pornography.
It was a nude.

395
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.820
It was naked pictures of another fucking woman.

396
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.780
You got caught and I screamed at you and you fucking deserve it.
All right.

397
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.700
You called me a lot of harsh words.

398
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.000
Well you deserved it to do it while you're lying in bed next to me.

399
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:08.090
What kind of man are you taking him to that level.

400
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.260
It might be the quarter of the podcast.

401
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.420
I just wanted to look at this naked girl and then,
then what happens?

402
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.050
I was taking that found out I was on IMD being and this actress,

403
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.390
what's her photos?
I MGB and what I am.

404
00:24:22.391 --> 00:24:26.270
DB had a link to her fucking naked videos and then some mother fucking popups

405
00:24:26.271 --> 00:24:26.840
that come up.

406
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.860
You were caught and it's a move for us and you're trying to make it funny or all

407
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:33.590
the guys listen to right now.
Here's the move in this moment.

408
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.960
If I want to look at a naked broad on my goddamn computer,
all right,

409
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:40.580
I'm going to do it.
You absolutely can,

410
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:43.850
but it's all right with what you're sharing are fucking would be marital bed.

411
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.040
I'm not going to stand for that.
I'm going to call you names.

412
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:50.240
I'm going to shame you and that's how it is possible.
A me half my childhood.

413
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.080
Your shame.
That's why we're talking about it right now.
No,
no.

414
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.590
I was trying to bring up something fucking funny.
Sacrificing me.

415
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.370
Fucking look.
Give me so that's how it is.
Yes.

416
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:05.510
I looked at a fucking naked actress.
All right,
there you go.

417
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.300
And I enjoyed it and I'll do it again.

418
00:25:08.301 --> 00:25:12.880
No you didn't because I screamed at you and it's the toy away from from you.

419
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.210
There was a lot of shame.
I was so like soap.

420
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.450
You know what it was.
I wasn't prepared and then that lady's voice.
I have.

421
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.730
I got it.
Yeah,

422
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:27.790
and then you fucking rolled over and you would just fucking in my grill and I

423
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:30.920
was sitting there just stuttering trying to shut it off.

424
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.420
I couldn't find the mute button.

425
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.440
<v 1>It's unreal.
Yeah.
Well</v>

426
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.590
<v 0>you don't do that.
That's rude.
I didn't set out to do it.</v>

427
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.610
See Internet.
Eventually you're going to end up at a fucking naked to do it.

428
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:51.700
You lied here with the specific intent of looking at a woman naked on the

429
00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:55.480
internet.
Yes.
You did.
Said,
oh,
I want to see those pictures.
And you clicked on it.

430
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.540
Oh,
that's not what I saw.
What you did start in the middle of story.

431
00:25:58.541 --> 00:26:03.541
It didn't expect was there to be a pop up to appeal to the kind of perverts over

432
00:26:03.851 --> 00:26:05.690
the head that you are and

433
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.110
I can't look at one fucking broad.
Let me tell you.

434
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.480
Absolutely can look at you on the road.

435
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.630
I'm going to take one minute and I'm going to put it over your face.

436
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.400
Me In bed and be looking at some naked women and get found out like that.
Yeah.

437
00:26:21.401 --> 00:26:24.010
You're going to get called on it.
What do you spend them on?
The snuggle up snake.

438
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.260
Ooh,
let's look at it together.
Fuck you.

439
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

440
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.230
<v 0>Oh,
there might be one of the greatest,
fuck you was out of a head.
Fuck.</v>

441
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:39.981
Oh,
that was beautiful.

442
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:44.940
I was thinking you guys got a bit when it comes to fucking lay in somebody out.

443
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.790
All right.
Yeah.
I have to tell you this.
I didn't go.

444
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:52.800
I didn't take over my computer and be like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

445
00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.960
I'm going to look at this naked girl while you're laying next to me.

446
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.440
I went on I N D B and I'm such a weak,

447
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.220
pathetic person that within three seconds I ended up on that,
but that's not,

448
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:07.830
I'm like one of those guys who's fucking did the crime.
This is second degree.

449
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:10.440
This isn't premeditated.
I didn't fucking walk in.
They're like,

450
00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:14.970
I'm going to look at this girl.
Okay.
I walked in.
Okay.

451
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.500
They saw the gumballs sitting there.
Stomach was growling.
I said,
fuck it.

452
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:22.620
I'm grabbing them and I got caught.
So yes,
I did rob the fucking store,

453
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.350
but I wasn't sitting at home going,
you know what I'm going to do today?

454
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.100
All right,

455
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.950
this and just throw a naked woman in there and you have the fucking explanation

456
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.650
we're looking at.
You knew who she was.
You knew that she posed naked.

457
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.330
You knew because you know who this person is.
All right.

458
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.020
Without going any further.
So for you to sit here and try to act like,
oh my gosh,

459
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.320
I was just investigating someone's life acting history.

460
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:51.450
Timberlake showed us fucking wiener on the Goddamn Internet.
You'd look at it.

461
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.890
What does that has to do with anything that we're talking about right now?

462
00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:00.090
Because you know what?
You were right.
You can I finish?

463
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.520
Can I finish?
Can I finish?
Sort of.
Can I finish?

464
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.770
You were right up until three minutes ago.
Just tried to throw me off base,

465
00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:13.980
but you're not going to do that playboy because I'm smarter than you.
All right.

466
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.800
All right.
And that was not be quoting dialogue from a bad cop show.
Yeah,

467
00:28:17.801 --> 00:28:19.430
I didn't do that.
Playboy.
Why don't you put your little,

468
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.520
your little gumball fucking siren on top of your nonexisting car.
Listen to me.

469
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.700
You will.
Right up until three minutes ago.
What's what's is now.

470
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:30.790
You know what you're doing now.
You're Hammond it up.
Oh,
your hand man is out.

471
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.650
You know what usually happens on the podcast should have ended with fuck you.

472
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.540
Can you please do it again?
Not You.

473
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:47.070
Alright,
there you go.
People.
There's podcasts.
That's the meat.
A log.

474
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.010
That's the NIA lie.
Listen,
I'm sorry that I looked at a,
a talented actress naked.

475
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.300
You know what do you want me to do?

476
00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:00.120
Will you shut up and stop outing the person you already fucking left like 90

477
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:04.770
clues.
What is wrong with you?
Be Mad at me.

478
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:08.400
Don't be mad at her.
I'm not mad at her.
Well then quit fucking doing that.

479
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.880
All right,
see he keep it again.
Keep it at me.
No,
I'm not.

480
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.270
This is about you and you know what?
This is what happens.
You know what?
This.

481
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.980
This is what happens every night around eight o'clock and nine o'clock and then

482
00:29:20.981 --> 00:29:24.750
she fucking drives me out of the house and I go out and do stand up.
Okay.

483
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.900
Yes I am.
And you can watch all your stupid.
Was it?

484
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:29.680
What was that fucking show you were watching

485
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.560
the show about the swimmer who doesn't get anything but swimming?

486
00:29:34.561 --> 00:29:37.170
What would Ryan lucky deal.
Oh my God.

487
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.670
Jesus Christ.
He's,

488
00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.070
he's hamming it up.
Yes.
I don't know that he is.

489
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.410
He's traveled the fuck at world.
He's won gold medals now near now.

490
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.210
No,
he's traveled the world and met with diplomats.

491
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:56.990
He traveled the world and jumped from pool.

492
00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.410
He has met with diplomats when he went and fucking gold medal,

493
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.660
homestead and get the key to the city.
This guys cut ribbons.
Okay.

494
00:30:02.661 --> 00:30:07.120
And he's open suits guys often zoos.
Okay.
You're not that.

495
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.170
He's not that dumb.

496
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.230
I don't know about that.
That's hot and that's really all that matters.
Okay.

497
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.730
And now,
now do I get upset?

498
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.580
Then I'm sitting on a couch and you're sitting there looking at fucking,
oh,

499
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:22.600
that's what you said the other night.

500
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:25.180
You see at this look on your face and I'm like,
you're not enjoying the show.

501
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:27.010
And you're like,
no,
I'm looking at those abs.

502
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.570
And if I was lying that see you looking at naked pictures or whatever of Ryan

503
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.850
Lacosse,
then you would absolutely have something to say about it.

504
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.140
So wait a minute,
that's not what happened as much.
I show.
Well,
okay.
Okay.

505
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:43.141
So the bed bedroom is not cool fucking bedroom.

506
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:48.520
It's where we,
I know what you're doing.
A bedroom,
it's a sacred space.

507
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:49.450
He believe this shit guys

508
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:55.120
got a swell guy like me would have to put up with this shit.

509
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.870
Can we not have the bedroom at least.
Okay.
But if,

510
00:30:58.871 --> 00:31:01.120
but if I did it in the living room,
if I did it in the living room,

511
00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:04.330
that would have been okay.
If I'm not in the bed with you,
yeah,
you're out.
No,
no,

512
00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:07.180
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
There's no,
there's no bed in the living room.

513
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:08.590
If I'm in the fucking living room,

514
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.540
I can look at a picture of a naked woman on the computer.
I just want to,

515
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.720
no problem.
I just want,
okay.

516
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:17.770
And if I hit on the thing and all of a sudden it grows,
I have,
I mean,
right there

517
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.193
you're not,

518
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.490
you're not gonna have a problem with them not letting them know.

519
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.470
But while lying in bed next to me,
that's a problem.
I can live with that.

520
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:34.120
So we're so we're absolutely.
So I paused.
I didn't know that that was the rule.

521
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.660
And once again,
Nia,
I was just looking at a fucking picture.
All right,

522
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:42.150
I'm a fucking guy.
She's a naked woman.
What am I supposed to do?
It's

523
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:47.980
one click away.
How do I resist?
As if you had no choice.

524
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.900
I really don't.
The way I'm wired,
I don't.
All right.
Oh,
please,

525
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.390
I don't accept that.
Oh,
fuck you.
And you want to Nia.
What if there was no,

526
00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.990
I don't necessarily that Nia,

527
00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:01.810
what if there was a store you could just walk into and it's a bunch of free

528
00:32:01.811 --> 00:32:06.400
shoes in a store right now.
Wait a minute.
It's a fucking metaphor.

529
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.500
It doesn't matter.
We're not talking about metaphors.

530
00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:09.820
We're talking about what actually happened.

531
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.420
I'm talking about how you're wired versus how I'm wired.
Okay,
you're aren't,

532
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.730
but you like stuff.
The guys,
you're in the shit.
You like hats.

533
00:32:18.731 --> 00:32:19.840
You like fucking shoes.

534
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:25.140
If a free hat or a free pair of shoes was a click away,

535
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:30.410
you'd fucking do that right in front of me in the bed.
You would,

536
00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.760
and then I heard some night here at somebody [inaudible] who is he to win?

537
00:32:34.761 --> 00:32:37.870
The fucking hat is not the same as what you were doing.

538
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.580
It's just not the end.

539
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.490
When you started to apologize for it and now you're trying to batch,

540
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.260
because I was trying to fucking apologize.

541
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:47.390
You keep coming at me like a goddamned mere cat.

542
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.590
I don't try to keep coming at you.

543
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:51.740
You should keep trying to like excuse yourself or what you did and you know that

544
00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:53.180
it's wrong.
You know what?

545
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.850
I know you think that you're doing some amazing shit here where you just not

546
00:32:55.851 --> 00:32:59.260
back it down.
Okay?
First of all,
what are you going to do to me?
Nini?
Huh?

547
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.970
What are you gonna do?
How are you going to body slam me?
I'm bigger than you.

548
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.931
I already said,

549
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:07.250
I have pushed you right off the fucking bed worn or whatever it is that you do.

550
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:11.030
I have no problem with that.
But if you're lying in bed next to me.

551
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.940
And I said okay.
And I said fucking settled.
I said,

552
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.900
Holly won it.
And I said okay.
So then we have nothing left to discuss.

553
