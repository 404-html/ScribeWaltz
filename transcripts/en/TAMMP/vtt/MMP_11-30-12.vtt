00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.290
Hey,

It's Belper and it's time,

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.820
once again for the lovely Nia and a log.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.040
<v 1>Uh,
we haven't done one of these in a minute because of a certain things.
My,</v>

4
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:18.041
a mixture of blew up when I was in Australia and then I got this stupid new

5
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:23.050
recorder and,
uh,
that I haven't been able to figure out,
but thanks to uh,

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.410
Ari Shaffir.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.140
I just called him up and he talked me through it got me off the ledge.

8
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.700
So Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.640
<v 0>the lovely Nia.
Hi,
how are you going?
Great.
Are you,
um,</v>

10
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:36.700
I'm actually nervous about this.
Why?
What's the,
why?

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.540
Because I have a feeling that I'm going to get trashed really badly because of,

12
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:45.310
uh,
yeah,
I mean,
you might be right about that.
You are right about that.

13
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.110
I apologize.
Mince words.
You know what?
I apologize.
Are you want to apologize,

14
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:54.670
but I mean,
it's like,
oh Jesus,
you guys,
you're actually,

15
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:57.040
this is going to be,
this is going to be a quick one.

16
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.100
I don't even know if we're going to get to the advice because I don't know

17
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.290
<v 1>thick my behavior was that bad.
Well go ahead.
Set it up near what is your</v>

18
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.790
<v 0>fucking promo this week?</v>

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.660
My problem with you is that this week I planned on the prize,

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.500
the prize outing for you specifically for you,
something that you wanted to do.

21
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.060
And it wasn't my birthday.
It was not your birthday,
not Christmas.

22
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.090
Just because I love you and everything.

23
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:31.960
I know it took a lot for me to say that for some reason didn't fly out of me as

24
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:34.750
it normally does so easily.
Um,
yeah.

25
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:38.260
And so I planned this thing for you and yes,

26
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:42.120
we left the house a little bit late.
That's,
that's special.
It started.
Okay.

27
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.270
I'm feeling just one little thing here.
I have no idea what this is.

28
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.350
<v 1>Price.
I'm thinking,
alright,
am I going to go to a gun range?</v>

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.140
Is it a sports thing?
We're going to go,
uh,

30
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.860
is this one of those check things where it's a surprise for me,

31
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:58.640
but it's really something.

32
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.480
<v 0>Think she wants to do like all the sudden some ballroom dancing class like,</v>

33
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:06.170
right.
Oh boy.
And here's your shiny shirt,
sir.

34
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.060
<v 1>I almost couldn't say that.
So anyways,
so you tell me.
Yeah,
yeah,</v>

35
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.280
it's right on a so and so and so and so.
We don't name Shit here,
right.

36
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.740
So I'm thinking that that's not that far away.
Yeah.

37
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160
We have to be there by six right?
Yeah.

38
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.110
We really had to be all the way over in east La.
Yeah.

39
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.140
So that what happens is we're supposed to be there by six and it's like five 58

40
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.930
we're stuck in traffic and I look on the,
the,
the Google map thing,

41
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.600
your thing wasn't working and now I see like,

42
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:37.530
we're like 10 minutes away for this thing.
I don't know what it is.
And I go,

43
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:39.450
what is it?
And she goes,
I can't tell you.

44
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.120
But they just said they're going to start without us.

45
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.680
And immediately I'm thinking like,

46
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.930
I'm not going to know how to load a fucking Beretta

47
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.460
<v 0>and they're just going to hand me a loaded weapon.</v>

48
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.890
And I don't know how to get to that point.

49
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.580
So the stress was building up for this dress was building up the traffic was

50
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:58.700
because it was that time of the night where everybody is traveling and have it,

51
00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:01.000
you know.
But you know,

52
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.200
the way that you deal with stress is by,
I don't know,

53
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:09.190
becoming more stressed or know the way that you deal with stress is becoming

54
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.830
angry.
So everything became like,

55
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.160
it's your reaction to stress everyone.
Great stress.

56
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.020
No,
I,
but I don't get like angry and start becoming like this,
this,

57
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.700
this evil ogre of anger like you do,

58
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.860
which is exactly what you did.
And I,

59
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.570
the directions to the plays were complicated and I was trying to read them the

60
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:38.650
way they were laid out because they were laid out as specific.
No,

61
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.550
but it was also,

62
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:42.940
they specifically wrote it that way on the website because it was complicated

63
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.810
and you kept trying to involve Google maps and it was telling you that we're,

64
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.320
we're parking is not going to be the same as where we're going.
So anyway,

65
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.910
by the time we got there,
we are all in a,

66
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.580
what do you mean that was driving you nuts?

67
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.000
I was just trying to get the directions.
Your bread house.

68
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.650
I was just trying to get near it.
Okay.
That's fine.
Since they had,

69
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:07.651
or the computer lady and the stupid fucking cyber bitch took us the wrong a

70
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:13.360
longer fucking way and then you'll be sent to you.

71
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:15.460
So listening to that Zombie on your phone,

72
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.650
that way it wasn't listening to a Zombie on my phone.

73
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:22.420
I was reading the directions that were given on the website.

74
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:27.421
I was not employing the Google fucking I apple maps where it talks to you now,

75
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:32.980
which I think is a great feature by the way.
Um,
it wasn't about that.
So anyway,

76
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.270
but the time we got there,

77
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.400
you had a fucking attitude and it was supposed to be a thing where you walked
in,

78
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.160
you were like,
oh my God,
we're doing this.
This is amazing.
And you were like,
Eh,

79
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.560
Eh,
Eh,
Eh,
Eh,
it will like this fire in your eyes and like,
you know,

80
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.510
energy and defense.
And it wasn't even fun anymore.

81
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.240
We were standing next to a fucking abandoned factory.
Yeah.

82
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:02.350
It wasn't a weird
look for a white awning.

83
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:05.290
So we started walking toward rusted out hunk of Shit.

84
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.700
Now that I think they shot like blue collar down there and like the fucking late

85
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.520
seventies it's a Richard Pryor movie and we walk up and you're like,

86
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.440
it's not a why gardening.
I'm like,
no,
no.
And then I go,

87
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.850
why don't you call them?

88
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.420
Because I knew at one point it's 10 past six and I still don't know what I'm

89
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:25.540
doing.
All I know is I'm 10 minutes late for doing whatever the fuck I'm doing.

90
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:28.570
I go,
why don't you call him?
She just called them.
You just talked to them.

91
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:33.070
They picked up the phone and for now all of a sudden you don't want to call them

92
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.330
and what I want to be like,
I'm in the middle of the alley.
Which way do I go?

93
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.320
Like I,

94
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.470
I mean I knew we were near there and I didn't just want to call it the light

95
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.280
down factory with the giant smokestack that says so and so next to it.
All right,

96
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:46.000
fine.

97
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But I squatted way down the way that I was putting together and I wasn't

98
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:56.920
stressed out and you were like,
you know,
barely containing your rage.
You,

99
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.160
you look like you were going to like wreck it Ralph mode and start punching

100
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.130
bricks and shit cause you would driving me fucking nuts at that point I wasn't

101
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:04.640
driving you nuts.

102
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.860
I wasn't doing anything but trying to get us to where we're going.

103
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.240
You guys are all in your head.
I got all like pumped up and you,

104
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.780
I see it happening with you.
I see your blood pressure rising.

105
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.410
I am actually looking at you and I'm seeing your blood pressure rise.

106
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.890
Your face is getting all red in the cheeks and you're like,

107
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.120
you know your jaw is tightening,
your eyes are darting back and forth.

108
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.610
I see.
I know what's going on.

109
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.620
She would drive me nuts because never mind that I am giving you this thing and

110
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.400
we're like,
oh no nevermind that.

111
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:42.020
You gave me this thing and you didn't elite allow enough fucking time to get to

112
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:42.854
the fucking thing.

113
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.550
I was trying to leave earlier and you were doing your typical thing where you

114
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.990
take forever to do.
Yes I am because this is a Nia log.
Typical,

115
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.870
typical thing.
Typical you.

116
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.100
You put on what I have sloping at a time at the slowest pace ever.

117
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.450
You like put your sucks

118
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.120
all slow and then you slide around the house for a little bit more going,

119
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.560
where am I?
Shoes,
which you know where,
where am I going?
What are we doing?

120
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:11.690
And it's taking for fucking habits.

121
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.150
I'll tell you why that's bullshit because you're acting like you're sitting

122
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:17.060
there and you're ready.
You're not urine.
They're putting your fucking face on.

123
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.200
I was telling me I had no idea what the fuck we were going,
what we were doing,

124
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:23.150
and you kept it as a surprise.
Should I wear this?
Is this okay?

125
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.660
Is this footwear okay?
What am I doing?
Am I going?

126
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.340
I told you all that and it still took you forever to get ready.

127
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.960
You're so full of shit.
We walked out of the house.

128
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.330
She left the fucking window open and the candle burning.

129
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.820
What does that have to do with anything?

130
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.340
One thing and you're bringing up something out.

131
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.290
This is what this is what it has to fucking do with it is if you were all ready

132
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:48.650
to go,
you would have had the fucking candle blown out and everything you wrote.

133
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.210
You weren't ready to either.
The other candle,
I forgot that I had two candles.
Oh,

134
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:56.030
the one that was sitting right in the table next to the fucking door.

135
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.360
What if that?
I blew it.
That was the Christmas one.
I bought the Christmas one,

136
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:02.540
but I didn't realize that one of the most overrated things ever having a blow

137
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:04.160
out a candle like,
oh my God,

138
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.490
what if that little flame leapt 200 feet as a possibility?

139
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.610
That's why they say you're not supposed to leave candles unattended.

140
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:16.070
That's what got Kat von D and Toronto.
It's impossible.

141
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.140
You have to be a fucking moron.

142
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.600
If you have a candle sitting in the center of a table,

143
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.460
you could have a 10 year Campbell candle,
right?

144
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.240
You can come back 10 years later and everything would be fine.

145
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.710
Other than the wax all over the fucking table.
It's not going anywhere.

146
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.500
What happens is it melts down and it create an excuse for that meat from like

147
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:39.800
sore throat here it creates like a fucking crater and it just keeps burning down

148
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:41.870
and down and down into it.
Okay.

149
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.500
Do you think the people at the candle store want to deal with a fucking arson

150
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:49.190
lawsuit around about arson lawsuit?
Every fucking time.
They don't.

151
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.180
They got them fine.
It's morons who liked them,

152
00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.040
walk away from them and they have them underneath the curtain,
like

153
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.740
<v 1>some little house in the prairie episode,
right?
Which I,</v>

154
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.070
which I did not know what you didn't,

155
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.720
but you're acting like you were totally ready.
You weren't listen last there.

156
00:09:04.721 --> 00:09:07.380
I love the fact he got me surprised when we tell the people what the surprise

157
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:10.770
was.
Okay,
so now,
so now we're sitting there and I go,

158
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.260
it's a pasta making cooking class.

159
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.300
I have just a pause here for all the guys would be like,
what else?
You know what?

160
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:23.301
I tweeted a picture of myself at the class last night and someone identified

161
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:28.581
your arm get bills like pasty Franco that arm out of that picture,

162
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.020
which I thought was hilarious.
Um,
so anyways,
so now we're walking in,
she's,

163
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:38.730
we're late for this pasta class.
You're pissed at me,
I'm mad at you.

164
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.850
And we come walking into this class where everybody's just like,

165
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.720
tell us a little bit about yourself and what you like about pasta.

166
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:52.050
And we come walking in and um,
and from there on out,
I hate a great time,

167
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:55.980
but for some reason you felt that I didn't know.
That's not true.

168
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.600
I think you had a good time.
I had a good time,
but it's pretty new careers.

169
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.740
I said this was awesome.
This is awesome.
You are very cute.
And the more,

170
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:05.220
and as we started like doing stuff like obviously our moods,
her,

171
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.040
then we were just having a great time and talking to people and it was fine.

172
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.590
I didn't embarrass you,
right?
Yeah.
Trash anybody now you did.
Well you did,

173
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:17.010
but you did it under your breath with that one girl when she poured it to

174
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.180
deposit thing.
Do I catch it afterwards?
No.
Let it fall on the floor.

175
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.830
Fucking throat.
And now it was,
it was a great time.
It was.
It was.
Uh,

176
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.310
but I think a lot of people can relate to that story as a couple.

177
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:36.060
You're going to do something that's supposed to be fun and something happens on

178
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:40.170
the way over there.
You come in,
you're all like tense with each other.

179
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.140
Like if you're going to have dinner with another couple and the other couples

180
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:45.930
lag.
Wow.
So you guys are really,

181
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.730
and that's what I don't understand why I would actually go to chick flicks if

182
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:54.840
they had a moment like that in the fucking movie and it was real and it wasn't

183
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:56.880
wacky.
I would enjoy that.
You know what?

184
00:10:56.881 --> 00:11:01.881
I don't like that fucking dishes 40 movie where they got the dude is sitting

185
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:05.790
there taking a shit,
talking to his wife while he's on the toilet.
Right.

186
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.240
Amount of times they have that.
And that never happens in a relationship.

187
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.190
Nobody ever gets comfortable enough to be mid shit shooting the shit with

188
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:17.610
somebody.
And I don't want to fucking hear for me if you do on this podcast,

189
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.290
because you're part of the weird,

190
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.550
I could say nobody wants to fuck a dolphin and somebody's going to say,
well,

191
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:26.220
actually a friend of mine,
I'm just saying generally speaking,

192
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.420
they put that in war.

193
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:32.370
God Damn movies did fucking Dustin Hoffman was taking a shit while Deniro was

194
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:35.190
taken a shower and one of those meet the parents.
It's just like,

195
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.720
I know it's supposed to be over the top,
but I,
that to me it's,

196
00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:41.970
it's a comedic device.
It's a hacky one.

197
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.650
It's been used too many times and it's based in absolute bullshit.

198
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.820
It doesn't happen.
And I,
that's my,
that's that to me,
uh,

199
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:54.040
that's the kind of comedy at fucking eight the most other than

200
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.280
<v 0>clever eyebrow raising.
Ooh.</v>

201
00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.360
To say other than that shit is when you're too fucking lazy to just pull from

202
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:05.830
what's actually happened in your life.
So then you invent,
okay,

203
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.290
how do we add,
raise the stakes.
Oh,

204
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.450
he's taking his shit when he's talking to work.
Grant.
Okay.

205
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.670
Don't say right.
Okay.
Like I've made my point.
I made it.

206
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.533
So anyways,
we're getting,

207
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.710
we get the pass the class and me because of my crust making background.

208
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.450
I'm fucking killing it.
You did it,
you know you did a really good job.

209
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:30.580
You were hitting your element because you like to cook.

210
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.870
You like to learn about these things.

211
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.040
You've been wiling to take a pasta making glass.

212
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.720
And I moved sit on your birthday this past year I found a place,

213
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:41.120
but it was too late.
It was all sold out.
So I was thinking ahead.

214
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.620
I read through the lines there.
I didn't give a shit enough about my boyfriend.

215
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.710
The fucking allot enough time.
How long does it mean?

216
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:51.250
How long does it take to sign up for a cooking class?
First of all,
listen,

217
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.500
stop sticking your face out at me.
If you just make the class.
It was books.

218
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.430
It was a present to say thank you.
Okay.
Stop turning it into,

219
00:12:59.431 --> 00:13:01.850
oh well you couldn't think of it.
I'm not talking about that.

220
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.890
I'm talking about back in in uh oh,
what does it do for your birthday?

221
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:08.110
But to just wasn't enough time.
Well No,
I,

222
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:09.610
when I started looking at things when it,

223
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:13.120
remember your birthday this year we did a series of fun activities that you

224
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:17.770
would want to do and when I went to find a class,
everything that I look to add,

225
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.130
um,
all the spaces were filled up so I wasn't able to do that.

226
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:23.680
So we did all the other things for your birthday,

227
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:28.420
like the concert and the horseback riding.
Horseback riding was your birthday.

228
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.990
No,
that was your bro.
What's yours?
What's yours?

229
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.690
You are such a fucking liar.

230
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.550
Oh my God.

231
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.760
You're such a lying sack of shit.

232
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.450
Why is every fucking photo from that day about you on the God damn horse?

233
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.180
Because you were taking it.
I wanted to put it on my Instagram.

234
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.550
That was your day.
That was,
that was an activity we did for your birthday.

235
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.920
He didn't want to go horseback.
I want to learn to ride a horse.

236
00:13:56.921 --> 00:14:01.620
I just want to sit on the fucking ridiculous.
We just sat on the God

237
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.500
your face out at me.

238
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.530
You think that makes me hear it more?
Cause you're eighth of an inch closer.
Nia.

239
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.470
I want to learn how to ride a horse like fucking,
oh shit.

240
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:16.780
Here comes some zombies.
Jump on a horse.

241
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.070
It's full fucking speed.
I don't want to just sit on it.

242
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.510
That's like a monkey is a class.
That's like an equestrian course.

243
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.640
That was for your birthday as well as house of Blues.

244
00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:34.450
That was all within the same week.
The John Bonham thing.
That was the shit.

245
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.220
He jump on him thing that Brian Tissue think that was the shit.
Yeah,

246
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.030
that was great.
But the horseback riding thing,

247
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:42.610
I really think that I got that for you now.

248
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.880
I got that and I got it for you for your birthday.

249
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:48.850
I don't want to go horseback riding.
I like horses and everything,
but like,

250
00:14:48.851 --> 00:14:52.190
you know,
whatever.
What are you talking about?
You were flipping

251
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.050
<v 1>out every time you touched this soft muscle.</v>

252
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.680
<v 0>I do like the Muslim wisely.
You know what we're getting?
We're getting off track.</v>

253
00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:03.130
No one wants to hear us,
you know,
bigger as a couple that's not entertaining.

254
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.460
Let's move on to the next down.

255
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.210
<v 1>Loading this.
They are in a fucking situation in their life that they,</v>

256
00:15:09.211 --> 00:15:13.090
they're getting on a fucking plane.
They wanted to keep going.
What do they want?

257
00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:15.790
Entertaining.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.

258
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.920
They're driving into stuck in traffic.
This is what these things are for people.

259
00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:21.731
Don't just like,
Hey,

260
00:15:21.731 --> 00:15:23.930
I'm going to take time and I'll be able to sit down and listen to these fucking,

261
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.910
this is the fucking eat up time when you do DMV.
Sorry.

262
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:33.100
Right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Go on to the inlaws.
Go on the back porch.

263
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.001
Hour and a half.

264
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:36.720
Did you have a good time at the pasta making class that I got for you?
Right.

265
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.390
A fucking great time.
Now my OCD is I want to uh,

266
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.530
take every class now.
My mother got me that kitchen aid thing years ago and I,

267
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.950
I had no fucking use for it.
I didn't know how to use it.

268
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.510
And now that I know how to do that,
like a,

269
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.420
but you want to hit the typical fucking scam of these corporate cons.

270
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.620
I asked the lady,
not really who was teaching the class.
I will stop it.

271
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.570
I'll ask the lady who was teaching the class about buying the attachments.
Right.

272
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.940
And uh,
you know,
cause I want to make sketti right.
And she goes,

273
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.040
oh well they have like,
you know,

274
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:12.370
cause I like the linguine one and I liked the one where you make the Ravioli.

275
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.270
So they have the attachment.
It you basically you buy it through kitchenaid.

276
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.710
There's a whole clump of them that you get the uh,
you get the Ravioli,

277
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.820
you get the fucking Linguini.
And then there's like angel hair,
pasta,

278
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.520
like anybody each that shit.
And then a couple others.

279
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.390
But the spaghetti one is sold separately.
Ah Yeah.

280
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:33.280
Cause they know everybody wants to spaghetti one.

281
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.490
But you're still gonna want Linguini and,
and the,
and the fucking other shit.
So,

282
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.230
I mean it's pretty much this,
I mean,

283
00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:42.140
I know it's wider or whatever then spaghetti is,
but it's kind of like this.

284
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:46.660
There's no fucking no,
it's like a four cylinder versus a fucking three 50.
It's,

285
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.650
it's,
it's underpowered pasta.
It's bullshit.
It's,
it's,
I don't even,

286
00:16:50.651 --> 00:16:55.000
what is it for?
What is what for Angel Hair?
Pasta,
eating hair.

287
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.630
I like angel hair.
Pasta.
It's nice since then.
And you know,
I don't know.

288
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.520
It's just nice.
So good.
Throw that in there.

289
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.470
Everybody knows you want the spaghetti one.

290
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.820
Well I can look at it in a positive way.

291
00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:07.980
Like maybe I just want to make spaghetti,
but why would you stop?
I don't know.

292
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.780
Why would you stop there?
Well,
I'm going to go get that attachment now.

293
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.640
Well we can't go get it because you're taking your little fucking bootcamp,

294
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.543
right?

295
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.440
<v 0>Yes,
I am starting tomorrow.
I am doing a six weeks,</v>

296
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.020
six week,
six weeks,
six weeks.

297
00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:26.530
I have my stupid Invisalign and it's messing with my teeth.
Um,

298
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.520
I'm doing a six week bikini body bootcamp at the place where I,

299
00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:36.460
it's hey kickboxing and um,
I'm like half excited,
half,

300
00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:39.530
like not excited.
I mean I'm not Kinda like

301
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:44.030
<v 1>me walking into the pasta class up to fighting through rush hour traffic.
Uh,</v>

302
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.770
sure.
So I am a pill.

303
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.930
You want to take a cooking class right in the middle of rush hour.

304
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:49.560
Traffic will leave with a half hour.

305
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.030
<v 0>Oh my God.
Oh my God.
I was an asshole there.</v>

306
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.490
As long as you agree that the horseback riding thing was for you.

307
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.130
It was not for me,
and I won't agree to this guys.
It's all or nothing with her.

308
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.710
She doesn't see compromiso bootcamp.
Six weeks commit.

309
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.070
Every Saturday we have a workout or weigh in,

310
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.070
there's a meal plan that goes along with it.
You know,

311
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:12.570
the whole idea is that you're,
you know,

312
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.830
optimal weight loss program for six weeks.
So I'm doing this thing.

313
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.610
So some guy's going to be screaming at you with his hands on his,
on your thighs,

314
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:24.870
adjusting you.
Is that basically,
oh,
I wish.
No,
it's a,
it's a woman.
It's a woman,

315
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:29.490
a really nice woman who does it,
but she's really tough to know.

316
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.940
She's like 30 something.
My son,
the way you said that,
she's a really nice woman.

317
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.760
She's a woman.
This just the way you said it,

318
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:40.710
you made it sound refer to every woman,
whether she's 80 or eight years old,

319
00:18:40.711 --> 00:18:45.360
a girl.
Is that true?
That is true.

320
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.200
Is that offensive?
Well,
it's a little,
I mean,

321
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:51.390
if we were talking about Maya Angelo,
you'd be like,

322
00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:55.320
that girl writes some great poems and you would say that about Maya fucking

323
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:59.750
Angelou.
Yes you will.
You head no,

324
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.750
but you will say you call women girls all the time.
I don't call old women girls.

325
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.740
You called your mom and you said your mother,
you've,
when you've referred to her,

326
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:12.570
you said girl,
at one point
that was a slip of the tongue.

327
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.900
Okay,
well then maybe it was a slip at the top girl.
I called my mother a girl.

328
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:16.890
Hey girl,

329
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.650
I'm just making up this shit about making up shit.

330
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.830
You say the word girl for women all the time.
When you should say a woman,

331
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.150
it's not offensive per se.
Well then get it off my fucking ass about it,

332
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.410
but I'm getting another thing.
Am I gonna call a blogger?

333
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.910
You would call Oprah girl.
You would,
you would call Hillary Clinton a girl.
No,

334
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.870
I wouldn't call it Clinton.
I call her Oprah.
Those they,
they've,

335
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:46.620
they've attained me knowing their name status despite the fact that not in my

336
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:49.710
life.
You just making up shit.

337
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.610
I'm not making them do it while I'm taking a shit talking to you in this

338
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:57.820
relationship.
No,
of course not.
But yeah.
Bootcamp.

339
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.790
So I don't know.
I don't know if anyone at camp,

340
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.910
I want to answer what I say.

341
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.410
I was working with this lady well before he started getting on the whole lady

342
00:20:07.411 --> 00:20:11.160
thing.
He said,
girl,
a lot.
Trust me.
You did.
Oh,
really?

343
00:20:11.161 --> 00:20:14.220
What else did I use to do that?
You still would know you.
You know what I mean?

344
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.240
This is what these neo logs are going to be above.
All right?

345
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:21.780
You want to get to the uh,
yeah.
Well,
I want to,
I want to hear from people.
Listen,

346
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:25.980
don't get to fucking bootcamp.
What do you mean on me?

347
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.250
I'm not going to get to diesel
with the whole thing.

348
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.670
That's going to be this ridiculous diet plan.
Jay,

349
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:37.500
hopefully there'll be a journalist jr a cheat day so that I can enjoy some nice

350
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:40.280
home.
Get to Serena on me.
Cirina.

351
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.320
It looks amazing if she doesn't have clothes on,

352
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.040
but when she starts wearing like when you get fucking big like that,
you remember

353
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.960
<v 1>back in the 80s when everyone got all roid it up?</v>

354
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.170
The only time those guys look like they were in shape as if they were standing

355
00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:57.420
there in speedos.
The second they put on a suit,
they look fat.
Hmm.

356
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.010
They look fad.
Yeah.
You get too big.

357
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.600
I think it looks awesome and her ass won't quit.

358
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.220
Let me tell you something about that girl,

359
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:13.080
<v 0>but has anyone done a boot camp?
Especially girls like we have to do a meal plan.</v>

360
00:21:13.081 --> 00:21:17.160
Do you end up sticking by that shit because it's a six week thing.
So you think,

361
00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:20.130
all right,
this is six weeks in my life.
That's not forever.
That's not so bad.

362
00:21:20.131 --> 00:21:23.370
I can hold off on boozing and desserts for six weeks.

363
00:21:23.371 --> 00:21:25.350
It's not like I'm never going to be able to have them again.

364
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.430
But do you just go right back to where you were before or is it like,

365
00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:33.210
is six weeks enough to ingrain in your brain?

366
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.590
This is how you should be living your life for the rest of your life now?

367
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.310
<v 1>No.
You're going to live at one way for fucking six weeks,
30 years.</v>

368
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.060
You can live your life one way for like 30 fucking years and then and then all

369
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:49.090
of a sudden it's six weeks.
You're going to turn around.

370
00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.610
<v 0>Well,
we'll see.
It's tomorrow's the first day.
I'm not trying to shit,</v>

371
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.430
<v 1>I'm just saying you're not just going to go there for six weeks and be like,</v>

372
00:21:56.431 --> 00:21:59.130
all right,
well I got that down.
You've got to keep doing it.

373
00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:03.300
That's what sucks about working out and eating like shit is the easiest fucking

374
00:22:03.301 --> 00:22:04.140
thing on the planet.

375
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.110
<v 0>Well,
I mean I don't completely eat like shit,</v>

376
00:22:07.111 --> 00:22:10.560
but I definitely have my wait till I get that pasta attachment.

377
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.120
I know at how great was the fucking Linguini.
Yeah,
it was great.
We made linguine.

378
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.220
I'll just wait until a dill linguine.

379
00:22:17.221 --> 00:22:20.940
You're not going to make homemade pasta and not give me any.
That's ridiculous.

380
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.320
Ridiculous.
Oh,

381
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:27.030
we made this Gel linguine with a vodka salmon sauce and it was fantastic.

382
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.760
<v 1>It was fantastic.
All right.
You know what's funny?</v>

383
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:34.780
When we went around the room where we had to share,
we would just like,
what?
Okay,

384
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.311
what is your name?

385
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:40.000
How did you get here and what is the last kick ass meal you had?

386
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.910
I thought that was cute.
It was,
and I was looking at you going,
God,

387
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:46.750
I wish I was like,
Nia.
What?
I was just like,
that's cute.
I just thought,
oh gee.

388
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.490
<v 0>But it was,
my name is Hank.
Uh,</v>

389
00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.420
I was drinking around the corner and I saw the light on and the last thing I

390
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:03.421
added was a fucking hot dog and it just gives a shit bond over food.

391
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.500
I know.
You're right.
You're right.
It was awesome.
It was awesome.

392
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.450
<v 1>It was awesome.
All right.</v>

393
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.690
I'm now paranoid that the chef is going to hear this and they think that I'm an

394
00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:14.710
asshole,
but evidently you already do.
So who cares?
All right.

395
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.770
Okay.
Here we go.
Uh,
uh,
I would also like,
okay,
Bill,

396
00:23:20.771 --> 00:23:24.310
sorry for the lengthy email.
I would also like to hear Nias opinion if possible.

397
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:29.050
Thank you.
That's what I'm here for.
Okay.
I dated this lady.
He actually says,

398
00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:30.910
girl,
evidently a lot of people do it.

399
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.480
I dated this girl dated the girl of my dreams.

400
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.270
Don't want ever says the woman of their dreams.
If you notice that,

401
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.970
<v 0>Ooh,
Ooh.</v>

402
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.980
I dated the girl of my dreams from the

403
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.670
<v 1>time I was 18 to 21 she was my best friend.</v>

404
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.690
We rarely had fights and when we did,
they were constructive.

405
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.010
The sex was great.
She got a,
this is like too perfect.

406
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:01.490
She supported me in my art and music endeavors.

407
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.920
We like all the same movies and shit.
Got along with the family,
blah,
blah,
blah.

408
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.510
I'm 22 now and we've been broken up for a little over a year.

409
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.690
Our breakup came as a surprise to both of us.

410
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.870
I broke up with her because I wanted to go out and date other girls and just

411
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:20.780
enjoyed the single life I felt like I owed.

412
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:25.781
I owed that to myself to explore and final and find myself a little.

413
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.180
Um,
Nia,
don't text during this.
This person's asking for your advice.

414
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:33.470
What are you doing?
You're on the phone.

415
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.720
I'm trying to find it so I can look at it too.
I have thought about most every,

416
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.120
I thought about her most every day since we broke up.

417
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:45.150
I like if he says it was a surprise to both of us when he broke up with her.
Um,

418
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.450
I have something to say about that.
I know that look,
brace yourself,
sir.

419
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.680
I just kicked the recorder.
Sorry.
Um,
blah,
blah,
blah.

420
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.550
I think I've thought about almost every day since we broke up.

421
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:01.520
I had to tell myself it was for the best,
but,

422
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:06.350
but always hope we get back together one day.
And on a side note,
if it's not,

423
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.740
it's not like I needed a best friend.
I have plenty of good male friends.

424
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:14.180
She just happened to be a girl I fell in love with and be super awesome.
Uh,

425
00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:17.660
by this point in the email,
I get the feeling you think I'm a pussy.
Fuck you.

426
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.440
I'm not a easy,
they're defensive.
I didn't say that.
Um,

427
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.630
while I was out being a man whore,

428
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.090
she was busy getting right back into a relationship.

429
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.150
They'd been dating for eight months or so.
I hate the guy.
Of course.

430
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.630
I don't really think they have anything too special.
Anyway.
Uh,

431
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:37.040
we've been talking a lot lately after basically no contact whatsoever for the

432
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:40.370
first year,
we pretty much went back to being great friends.

433
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.880
We've actually gotten coffee and breakfast together.
Oh Gee,
gee,

434
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.400
here we go.
And I'm pretty sure her boyfriend doesn't know about it.

435
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.690
She's even come over to my house a couple of times.
Parentheses,

436
00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:57.650
we haven't done anything.
Okay.
I'll believe that.
Uh,

437
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:01.370
she knows why we broke up and understands and thinks it was important for both

438
00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:04.370
of us.
We've talked about all aspects of our relationship,

439
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:07.730
including how great things were and even our sex life,

440
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.390
I have enough restraint to keep my dick in my pants.

441
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.260
Plus I know she would never cheat on the guy should I tell her how I feel?

442
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.680
Do you think it was unwise?
It's unwise to get back in a relationship with her.

443
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.810
Do you,
do I move on?
I know that's always,
wait a minute.

444
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.300
I know that I'll always wanted to get with other girls,

445
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:29.570
but do I really need to go out and bleed my dick dry to finally be ready for a

446
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:33.980
serious relationship with someone I could see spending the rest of my life with

447
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.630
a thanks to reading a love the podcasts.
All right.
When he got Whoa,
Jesus,

448
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:39.910
look at that.
Look.
What do you got to say though?

449
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.360
What I have to say is that you are an image.
Sure.

450
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.590
<v 0>A selfish jerk face.</v>

451
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.590
That's exactly what I think you are and isn't he supposed to be fine,

452
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.910
but I can still call a spade a spade.
You're an immature,
selfish jerk face.
Now,

453
00:26:56.911 --> 00:26:59.340
wait a minute.
Are you just saying this because you cause you're putting,

454
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:01.470
you're inserting yourself into this situation.

455
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:03.660
You would have been the one who got your heartbroken.
No,

456
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.950
because I've been that person and I was an insensitive,
selfish jerk face.

457
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.100
Oh,
okay.
Well,
it would've been nice if you said like me.

458
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.950
I was waiting for the big reveal.
She's talking about herself.
Yeah.
Well,

459
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.550
obviously when you're that young,
you're not thinking forever.
I mean,

460
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:23.910
maybe you do in the beginning because that's what the movies and TV tell you.

461
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:25.110
I'm going to be with this person forever,

462
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.610
but inevitably need to take a shit in front of her.
Right?
But inevitably,
yeah,

463
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:33.260
you're going to,
especially as a guy,
in my case,
I am a girl,
you,

464
00:27:33.261 --> 00:27:37.020
you think I want to go out and see what the whole world has to offer.

465
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.830
And then what you find as it is in life and you get older,

466
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:43.920
is that that can sometimes be a very empty pursuit.

467
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.850
And unless you end up finding somebody while you're whoring around,
as you say,

468
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:48.960
that is like,
wow,

469
00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:51.810
you're even better and understand me even more than the last person,

470
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.830
you're going to feel empty and like it's not really worth it.

471
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.280
So of course that's what you discovered.
So of course,

472
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.870
because you're a selfish jerk,

473
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.710
you want to go back to your ex girlfriend and be like,
oh,
you know,

474
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.100
now we're hanging out.
Now we're friends.
She's hanging out with me.

475
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:09.540
I'm sure her boyfriend doesn't know about it,

476
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:12.900
but she would never cheat it because she's such an angel and we even talk about

477
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:15.690
our sex life.
Like,
what are you doing?
What are you doing right now?

478
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.350
Should I tell her?
Yes,
yes.
Why don't you tell her?

479
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.290
Why don't you fuck up her relationship that's going so well?

480
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:26.460
Why don't you just throw it in her mind that like you're still now and you want

481
00:28:26.461 --> 00:28:29.460
her back?
Why don't you just act as selfish as you can possibly be?

482
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.400
If you really care about this girl,
you step away,

483
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.670
you be a man and you let her have this relationship.

484
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.580
If it doesn't work out with her and the guy and she comes back to you and it's

485
00:28:38.581 --> 00:28:43.020
all lovely and fairytale and rainbows,
then great,
but you stay away from her.

486
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.300
Jesus Christ,
first of all,
they're really,

487
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.470
how do you feel that their relationship is going gray when she's with her

488
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:52.800
fucking ex boyfriend in the guide,
these fucking apartment?

489
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.610
Maybe it's not.
Maybe it's not.
Well,

490
00:28:57.611 --> 00:28:59.700
you just fucking roasted the guy.

491
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.340
Well because he's the one that's writing in saying like,

492
00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:05.700
I know I'm still going to want to get with other girls will.
Obviously,

493
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.160
obviously you're going to want to bang other people.
That's what,

494
00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:09.540
that's what happens in life.

495
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.370
Like I don't necessarily believe that we are these naturally monogamous

496
00:29:14.371 --> 00:29:16.950
creatures,
but you do it because that's what a commitment is.

497
00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:18.150
That's what growing up is.

498
00:29:18.151 --> 00:29:21.300
You're committed to one person unless you have some sort of deal worked out.

499
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.970
Okay,
so of course you're going to want to bang other girls.

500
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.900
Do you need to let your hoodies a bleed your dick out before you're ready for a

501
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:32.340
relationship?
Well,
with your maturity level,
probably.
Probably sir.

502
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.580
So why don't you just bang a bunch of whores and get it out of your system while

503
00:29:37.681 --> 00:29:41.380
pining for a girl who actually cares and he has to do what he supposed to do.

504
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:42.250
You know what he could have done?

505
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.430
He could have stayed with her and just fucked around on her and he did.

506
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.480
He should get a cookie for doing the right thing.
Congratulate fucking lesions.

507
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.980
Jesus Christ.
But you're,
you're acting like he's fucking immature.

508
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.380
That's a real mature move that he did that he was like,
listen,

509
00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.520
I want to see other people.
I don't want to cheat on you.

510
00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:02.810
I mean that's pretty fucking matured.
Mature.

511
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.960
He's 22 years old.
He supposed to want to fuck everything.
That's what I say.

512
00:30:08.961 --> 00:30:12.010
And he should go out there and go do it.
Yeah.
He said,
but I don't like,

513
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.890
I don't like this whole,
you know Ron,
the girl back in his book,

514
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.250
I shouldn't do this bullshit.
And I know you haven't talked for the first year.

515
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.410
So I mean if you haven't talked for a year,
that's,
that's a,

516
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.070
that's a good amount of time to stay awake.
I think what he's doing,

517
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.310
but he's trying to have his cake and eat it.

518
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.230
Wouldn't drawn are drawn her.

519
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.180
So her feelings for this other guy won't get too deep.
You know,

520
00:30:34.181 --> 00:30:37.330
he'll fuck up their relationship or whatever.
And you know,
this girl,

521
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:40.930
you dated her for three years,
you know exactly how her brain works.

522
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:42.730
You know exactly what buttons to push.

523
00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:45.010
Like don't try to act like this is such a like,

524
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.960
oh naturally now we're friends again.

525
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:51.610
It's like of laying the seeds for this for a while.
I feel like,

526
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.970
and I don't think that that's right because you're not really allowing her to

527
00:30:54.971 --> 00:30:56.560
have a relationship.
If she has,

528
00:30:56.561 --> 00:31:00.010
if she's hanging out with you and your home and he doesn't know about it,
that's,

529
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.690
that's a problem.
Right?
That's a problem.
Extra spiffy when she came over,

530
00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:08.950
but not too much spiffy and other talking about their sex life.

531
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.840
Why are you talking about your sex life?
Why is your ex girlfriend,

532
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.510
was she doing it or unless he's emailing and emailing,
I would be like,

533
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:19.360
what you're doing?
Let's he steered it in that direction.
He did.

534
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.810
I know we had to break up.
I know it was you and Noah,
you understand?
No,

535
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:26.230
you're cool.
So you totally,
you totally get it.
But like,
I don't know,

536
00:31:26.231 --> 00:31:30.610
sometimes I can't help but think,
but like you and I just had this connection.
No,

537
00:31:30.611 --> 00:31:32.620
no,
no.
I know you have a boyfriend then.
I'm not trying to,

538
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.541
I'm not trying to be weird.

539
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:35.680
This is weird that we're talking about it as this weird cause I'm not trying to

540
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:39.520
be okay.
No,
you understand.
You're so awesome.
I just,
Ah,
I blew it with you.

541
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:42.430
Didn't I know I blew it.
I blew it.
No,
I want you to be happy.

542
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.380
You're a fucking emotional manipulator playing games with this girl and I won't

543
00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:51.370
stand for it.
All right.
I can't argue with that.
I think she's got,

544
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:52.210
you nailed that buddy.

545
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:54.880
But I don't think you're a piece of shit cause you want to go and fuck some,

546
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.990
a bunch of women,
not a piece of shit,
but I'm going to tell you what's the real,

547
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.380
okay.
The fact that you're coming back,
you're going to tell him,

548
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.050
when are you going to say what's real?
Being all like,
you know,

549
00:32:05.051 --> 00:32:08.380
sweet and friendly and talking about your sex life with your ex girlfriend,

550
00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:11.710
knowing full well she has a boyfriend and it's because it's coming from a place

551
00:32:11.711 --> 00:32:15.280
where you're like,
oh shit,
I realize what I lost.
That's not,
no,

552
00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:17.320
you don't do people like that.
That's wrong.

553
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.740
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

554
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.510
<v 0>Then j Lo have a song about being real.</v>

555
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.483
<v 2>Then she</v>

556
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.810
<v 0>did you buy that?
Was that written by somebody else?</v>

557
00:32:27.811 --> 00:32:32.400
So did she really sit there thinking that
I was a huge halo fan?
So yeah,

558
00:32:32.401 --> 00:32:36.360
I brought all her music.
You don't know why?
I didn't know why.
A clothing line,

559
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.400
I'm not ashamed to admit it.
Did you buy those,
those,
it was a two thousands.

560
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.410
<v 1>Okay.
Did you buy those hoary timberlands that she used to walk?</v>

561
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.270
<v 0>You know what I actually did?
I wanted those,</v>

562
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.410
those healed timberland boots.
What I did not realize because I was young,

563
00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:54.770
I didn't know anything about designer shit,
was that it wasn't Manolo Blahnik.

564
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:58.970
And so I actually called the Timberland store is vibrating my phone.

565
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.350
I called it off.
What's going on?
The thing,
I'm in the middle of a thought here.

566
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.810
I called the Timberland store and said,

567
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.420
are you carrying the Timberland boots with the heels?
And they're like,

568
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.300
does or Manila blacks?
And I,
I didn't know.

569
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.240
That's obviously a really expensive shoe.
It is a very expensive shoe.

570
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.950
Made famous on sex and the city.
No,
that's Christian Lubitel.
Uh,

571
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.620
but uh,
I actually got the fake,
uh,

572
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.610
he'll timberlands from Steve Madden and Iraq,
those with some cargo pants.

573
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.780
Cause I thought I was J lo.

574
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.120
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.
That's terrible.
It was terrible,
but it was like,
you know,</v>

575
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:39.200
2004 or something.

576
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.500
I should wash jeans when I used to watch all those hair metal bands.

577
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:47.240
I have big orange Afro.
I didn't have the orange Afro back then,

578
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.780
but I did.
I did it a couple of times.

579
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.240
Try wearing a Bandanna if I was going to go to a concert

580
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:59.120
<v 0>and even I even picture you in right now.
No,
I looked,</v>

581
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.680
<v 1>I dunno what I look like.
I know the obvious would be like,</v>

582
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.030
look like you had cancer.
I just didn't.
I was just like,
I can't do this.

583
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.240
Do you know what ever one time we were playing,

584
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.730
we used to play a pickup football.
When I was in high school.

585
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.700
It was all the kids who wanted to play football but didn't want to go through

586
00:34:14.701 --> 00:34:17.430
the bullshit of actually having some guy,
you know,
yelling at years.

587
00:34:17.431 --> 00:34:18.360
You ran around the track.

588
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:22.140
We just had a fucking great time and this one kid showed up.

589
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.470
He had a Bandanna tied around his head and one around his thigh.

590
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.960
I don't know why around his,
this upper thigh and we would call him.
Yeah.

591
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:33.330
Like Chachi like Scott Baljit is,
so we started calling them Shachi.

592
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.540
I think he might even had like the fingerless gloves.

593
00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:41.150
<v 0>Judd Nelson on exactly little bread for breakfast.</v>

594
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:47.230
He looked bad ass though.
He looks,
you know the Bandanna,
the earrings,

595
00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:50.130
the feathered hair,
the fingerless gloves.
That's one of the Credo

596
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.840
<v 1>is in a,
in a,
uh,
t coming of age.
He was great.
He was a,</v>

597
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:58.840
what was his name?
They're not judge Reinhold.
What's his real name?
Nelson.

598
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.760
Judd Nelson.
Anyone outside?
It was a judge.
Um,
all right.

599
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:08.360
What the fuck was I going to talk and do it on the boat?
Ge,

600
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.950
it was funny about that.
Is is uh,
what's his face?

601
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.990
Anthony Michael Hall who was playing the Nerd,
his name,

602
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.800
his character's name was Brian Johnson,

603
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.440
which I always thought was funny cause that's the lead singer of ac DC.

604
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.490
One of the baddest dudes ever.
Well that's one of the gorilla.
Do you want to,

605
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.840
you want to do one more of these or if you had nice.
Yeah,

606
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.640
I don't know if I'd do it with the next one because I already fucking read this

607
00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:35.030
one,
but we'll do it.
What do you know somebody right now?

608
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.240
They'd probably just reach cruising altitude,
begging,

609
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.780
but it's when you've already answered before I answered it this week on the

610
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.840
podcast.
But we could hear your perspective for once in my life.

611
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:49.640
I could shut the fuck up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

612
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.330
I don't think so.
Come on.
You work on your comeback show.
Yeah,
I gotta get,

613
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.170
I gotta get better if I want to be with the master such as you be.

614
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.810
Set me up for the puppies right here and quicker with my come back.
Oh,

615
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.210
by the way,
uh,

616
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.100
the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit February 19th,
Tuesday.

617
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.770
Can't wait.
That's going to be a gay man.
Going to be awesome.

618
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:12.450
I don't want to thank everybody who bought tickets last.

619
00:36:12.451 --> 00:36:15.250
I heard there's like 90 left.
Yup.
Get on it.
Quit.

620
00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.300
Everybody is going to break my balls that I didn't promote it on,

621
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.040
on my podcast on Monday.
It was just one of those things I wanted to,

622
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.350
to announce it on the opiate.

623
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:29.910
Anthony show because of what I felt that they did for Patrice,

624
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.850
having them on,
they're hyping his gigs and just like,

625
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.170
I mean there's just hours of footage of him on that show that you could watch on

626
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:40.650
youtube every day and it gives like someone who never met him,

627
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.390
that experience of,
of kind of what it was like to hang out with that guy.
So,

628
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.250
um,
I wanted to do it that way.
So for,
I get emotional.

629
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:53.580
Let's read this next one.
All right.
Hey,

630
00:36:53.581 --> 00:36:57.810
bill loved the podcast back cataloguing it like crazy.

631
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.760
Here's my fucking problem.
I got a roommate who was wonderful.
We're buddies.

632
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.920
We watch stupid shit and laugh at it together.

633
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:09.090
He's got this girlfriend who was a drain on everything that fun in the world.

634
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.590
I'm not talking about the regular guy,
girl argument crap.
I mean everything.

635
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:14.341
Quick example,

636
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:18.270
we were watching that BBC planet Earth series and we're just looking at the most

637
00:37:18.271 --> 00:37:20.430
beautiful shit in the world literally.

638
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.610
And all she could do is bitch about how ugly the birds were.

639
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.600
Complain about David Attenborough's Voice,
oh my God.

640
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:32.280
Or get mad at some animal just because it's killing another animal to survive

641
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.650
after we,
that would really ruin it.

642
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:39.320
<v 0>Yeah,
I seen that series,
but it's supposed to be amazing,</v>

643
00:37:39.321 --> 00:37:42.170
so I'm already mad that someone would ruin it like that.

644
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.930
Potheads love that fucking shit.
Oh yeah,
that's,
that's all.

645
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.070
That's the best time to watch.

646
00:37:46.071 --> 00:37:50.720
The plan was made so big,

647
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:53.760
man.
He me edgy.

648
00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.410
If you like a plant man and like,
you know,

649
00:37:56.411 --> 00:38:00.670
open up and they close down and then a bead combine,

650
00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.770
you wouldn't be scared man.
Your friend.

651
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:08.150
Here's my flower juice and that's the thing.

652
00:38:08.151 --> 00:38:11.750
That's what's so lovely is sometimes about smoking pot is that you can do silly

653
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.250
like good,
clean,

654
00:38:13.251 --> 00:38:18.251
fun things like watch a documentary on the planet earth and just the smoke pot

655
00:38:18.291 --> 00:38:21.860
and just laugh and being filled with why wish I could do that filled with

656
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.230
wonderment.
I wish I could do that

657
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.540
<v 1>because I can't sit down and watch a documentary on the planet earth unless I've</v>

658
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:28.374
taken some drugs.

659
00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.630
<v 0>Why can't you just sit there and enjoy it?
You can,
but it's more fun.
I get it.</v>

660
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.660
I break the glass,
it's silly.

661
00:38:37.661 --> 00:38:42.400
It's like no one smokes pot and goes out and like robs banks are not p y over.

662
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.240
Are you really going to go with it?
Like that hasn't been true.
People say,

663
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.510
well everyone says it because it's true.
It's because it's a fucking,

664
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.090
it just mellows you out.
Yeah,
exactly.

665
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:56.260
To the point you become party your couch and you wake up years later and you're

666
00:38:56.261 --> 00:39:01.180
still sitting there eating fucking Fritos and you were all right with it.
Hey,

667
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:05.950
we're all right with it.
Don't harsh my mellow man.
Yeah.
All right.
No,
I'm not.

668
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.800
I'm looking.
So anyway,
this is not like booze.

669
00:39:07.801 --> 00:39:11.710
Is any of this girl is being a complete wet blanket during this amazing

670
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:12.544
experience.

671
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.650
<v 1>Way To say it.
Yes.
Um,
so anyways,
he goes after we finish this,
this documentary,</v>

672
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.090
she said she would love to be a crew of a nature documentary shoot.

673
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:27.210
Um,
and anyways,
she's got no soul.
The guy loves earth.

674
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.480
They've been together for over a year,

675
00:39:28.481 --> 00:39:30.880
but it's clear he can't stand to be around her.

676
00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.750
<v 0>The only ever argue and not the great</v>

677
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:35.930
<v 1>are you and Nia did.</v>

678
00:39:35.931 --> 00:39:38.630
And one of the podcasts where you all laughed with each other.

679
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:42.680
It's unbearable and she's at my apartment five days a week.

680
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:48.300
Most nights I eventually either drink or just smoke so I can just stay in this

681
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.730
so I'm not in the same world as her and I liked smoking.
Who am I kidding?

682
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:57.110
I want all,
I want to wait,
I want to talk to him about it.

683
00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.420
But he's a really private person.

684
00:39:59.421 --> 00:40:02.930
We've never talked about his relationship stuff.
He tends to steer away from it.

685
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:07.700
It becomes pretty obvious that I can't stand the girl.
It's becoming pretty.

686
00:40:07.701 --> 00:40:10.460
Obviously I can't stand that girl Norkin nor can any of our friends.

687
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:15.500
I'm afraid she's going to drive us apart and then feast on his soul so she can

688
00:40:15.501 --> 00:40:18.040
try to find some kind of personality for herself.

689
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.870
<v 0>That is hilarious.
How do you like,
how do you think I should approach</v>

690
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.880
<v 1>this topic with this guy?
I got a right to complain to him about this girl,
right?</v>

691
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.920
Yes.
Got To do a tenderly or something.

692
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:33.530
<v 0>Yes,
yes to both those things.
I mean listen,
you live there too.</v>

693
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.380
So if their arguments and everything are,
it's,

694
00:40:36.381 --> 00:40:39.080
it's effecting your enjoyment of living in your home,

695
00:40:39.081 --> 00:40:42.830
then you have every right to to say something.
It's how should we go about it?

696
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:48.500
Yeah.
Well that's the tricky part.
Just say,
you know,
do they smoke weed first?

697
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:54.320
Just say,
you know,
obviously like you're one of my best friends.

698
00:40:54.321 --> 00:40:58.310
I love hanging out with you,
but I gotta be honest with you.
I'm not,
I,
I'm not,

699
00:40:58.311 --> 00:41:01.430
I don't really get along so well with whatever the fuck her name is.

700
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.160
So I don't know if I'm going to be hanging out with you guys so much.

701
00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:07.210
If she's over here,
I don't think I'm going to be hanging out as much and just,

702
00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.400
just,
we'll put it like that.
Don't say I feel like you should break up with her.

703
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.480
I feel like she's going to rob you of your zone or feast on you or whatever you

704
00:41:14.481 --> 00:41:17.090
said,
which was so great.
You don't have to say all that.
Just say,
you know what,

705
00:41:17.091 --> 00:41:20.690
I'm just not really,
you know,
I don't,
I don't get along with her.

706
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:25.670
You guys fight a lot.
It's really uncomfortable.
Like there was a good one.
Yeah,

707
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.850
just fight a lot.
Yeah,
you guys fight a lot.
I hear it and I just,

708
00:41:28.851 --> 00:41:31.490
it's really uncomfortable.
I just want to chill out at home.

709
00:41:31.491 --> 00:41:33.770
I don't have a good time with her when we're hanging out.

710
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.340
I don't know what you want to do.
Can you guys hang out more at her place?
Maybe,

711
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.580
but I just,
this isn't working for me.
I live here too.

712
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:43.790
I pay half the rent and you're my friend so I want to,

713
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:46.190
I want to be honest with you and see what he says.

714
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.100
And he might probably be just be like,
yeah,
I know,
I know,

715
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:52.010
but he's got to figure that shit out for himself.
But at least you say it,

716
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.020
cause that's the girl that he might flip out,
he might flip out,

717
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:00.230
but unless he's calling the girl names and saying,
you know,

718
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:03.500
your girlfriends a bitch and I can't believe you're dealing with that,
you know,

719
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:05.750
Luna Tech,
then it should be fine.
But if he says,

720
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:09.470
I don't really get along with her,
I don't have a good time when she's here.

721
00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.120
You guys fight.
And I just,

722
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:14.810
I'm not into it and maybe we can work out a different schedule so that you hang

723
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:18.950
out a bit more at her place because I live here too.
That's it.

724
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:23.300
That's a very nice way of saying,
yeah,
girl is a big bag of Douchey.
Yeah.

725
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:27.620
And the thing is your friend knows it too and,
but it may be a good thing too,

726
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:31.070
because no one else is saying it to him.
So I actually do you do that?

727
00:42:31.071 --> 00:42:33.370
How you tell your friend that they're dating an asshole?
It's a,

728
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.700
it's a tough situation.

729
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.140
I didn't have the balls to break up what you just said.

730
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:41.100
I think it was way better than what I was saying on the part.

731
00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.450
I remember what the fuck I said,
but just go in there and just saying,
listen,

732
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.520
you know,
I like you.
I want you to be happy.
But you and your girlfriend,

733
00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:51.770
you argue a lot.
And it it,

734
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.750
it's wearing me down and I'm finding that I'm medicating myself so I can be

735
00:42:56.751 --> 00:42:58.640
around it and I don't want to be around it.

736
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.730
I'm not saying she can't come over here.
I'm not saying that,

737
00:43:01.731 --> 00:43:04.630
but if there's any way,
you know,
she's over here five days a week,

738
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:08.150
there's any way he could just split those.
Yeah.
You know and you know,

739
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:11.660
if you love this girl then I'm not going to get in a,
we never trashed the girl.

740
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.650
That's a huge,
don't have a trash trash the girl.
I mean inevitably he,

741
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:18.530
if he goes along with it the room and says okay,
you're right,

742
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.110
he will have to say that the girlfriend,
you know what,
let's hang out.

743
00:43:21.111 --> 00:43:22.160
But I like hanging out here a place.

744
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:24.890
Well you know my roommate kind of just wants time to themselves.

745
00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:26.120
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh,

746
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:31.010
[inaudible] asking to go right off and flip out regardless.
You know,

747
00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:34.850
cause he's going to tell her.
Yeah,
he has solo.
He asked him.

748
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.290
He doesn't have to.
If he's a smart guy,
he won't say Shit.
What will he,

749
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.250
how will they do at though?

750
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.710
Just say let's take out of your house going to create a nightmare.

751
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:44.570
That's what fucking broke up the Beatles.

752
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:47.390
That's what broke up the Beatles is John.

753
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:51.650
And Paul kept going home and bitch under their fucking girls about each other

754
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:54.380
rather than just fucking hash it out between themselves.

755
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:58.070
And then the fucking women got sick of hearing it and they said,

756
00:43:58.071 --> 00:44:01.640
well then fucking start your own band.
Right.

757
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:06.970
You fucking driving me nuts and everybody blames Yoko and fucking uh,

758
00:44:07.341 --> 00:44:11.090
what's your face?
But you know that video I showed a long time ago where,

759
00:44:11.091 --> 00:44:11.811
what's his face,

760
00:44:11.811 --> 00:44:16.811
John Lennon is playing guitar with Chuck Berry and they're playing some fucking

761
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:18.780
song from back in the 50s that,
you know,

762
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:23.240
inspired like John Lennon I guess to pick up the guitar like they loved Chuck

763
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.960
Berry and then only play in one of those fucking uh,
you know,

764
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.690
back in the USA kind of fucking songs.

765
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.750
And Yoko is out a little control.
He had his relationship.

766
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:38.751
He lets Yoko be in the band on TV playing with them playing bongos and they have

767
00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:43.650
this little fucking Bango with one microphone on it and out of the fuck was the

768
00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:44.071
sound guy,

769
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:48.360
but he should have had the mic off cause they're in the middle of this fucking a

770
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.590
one two three o'clock,

771
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:53.310
four o'clock probably kind of fucking old school rock and roll song and she just

772
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:56.700
grabs the mic and watch your ears.
Everybody.
I'm going to try not to it too loud.

773
00:44:56.701 --> 00:44:57.534
She just goes

774
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:00.240
<v 3>like</v>

775
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.073
<v 0>fucking,</v>

776
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:06.150
I didn't know where to look on Chuck Berry's face

777
00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.450
is priceless.

778
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:15.750
He just looks at the crowd with his eyes wide open and you know exactly what

779
00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:20.050
he's saying.
He is.
He is this guy in this email,

780
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.260
in that fucking video.
He's basically looking at the crowd.
Go on.

781
00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.400
I don't know what he sees in her.
I can't say shit.
He loves her.

782
00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:33.180
I would like to see the looks on the people's faces that he used to pee on Chuck

783
00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.880
Berry.
I'd like to see that.
What the willing people who are into that stuff.

784
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:40.270
I thought you didn't judge people.
I don't judge people,
but that's awful.

785
00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:41.980
Why are you,
why are you judging them for that?

786
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:45.970
And I actually thought he took pictures of people taking dumps.
He did.

787
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.100
I didn't know about that then.
I don't know why he just peed on people.
Well,
look,

788
00:45:51.101 --> 00:45:55.000
you're a rockstar.
You've done everything.
You checked everything off the list.

789
00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:59.950
What else can I do to this girl?
And they let him,

790
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:05.230
and it's a legitimate thing that some people are into nine.
Yeah.

791
00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:09.550
Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
Yes.

792
00:46:09.551 --> 00:46:14.170
I try to be tolerant and I try not to judge.
You're just mad because once again,

793
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.150
this is a,
this is a lady,

794
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.230
I actually blamed the fucking Beatles breaking up on Paul and John.

795
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.900
Can I get credit for that?
I got,
okay,

796
00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:25.350
well then can you lease roll with me that you

797
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.660
kill the fucking classic song?
No,
you're right.
You're right.

798
00:46:31.661 --> 00:46:34.210
But I just was thinking of Chuck Berry and I just remember hearing that he used

799
00:46:34.211 --> 00:46:38.380
to pee on people and you said Chuck Berry is reaction.
And it made me think of,

800
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.710
I wonder what the reaction was as he is,
you know,
sorry.

801
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.550
It's actually funny and it goes from like,
oh my God,
I'm fucking like,
you know,

802
00:46:45.551 --> 00:46:48.940
Rock Blues,
Guitar,
God,
Chuck Berry,

803
00:46:48.941 --> 00:46:51.070
and now he's paying on me.

804
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.520
And this was back in the day before people would talk about this and it was

805
00:46:54.521 --> 00:46:58.470
known that it was,
you know,
this was a real taboo things and I talked to them.

806
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.260
Margin,
you're having sessions guide and all of a sudden he starts peeing on you.

807
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.990
That's like a new thing.
No,
no,
not new.

808
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:08.800
It's new that people are discussing more openly.
I don't think back in,

809
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.540
when was he big?

810
00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:15.490
50th sixties like didn't the Greeks like openly talk about homosexuality like

811
00:47:15.491 --> 00:47:19.780
fucking a thousand fucking years ago.
Didn't they do that then?
They may be,

812
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.360
they had a room just for you to go on and throw up and after you fucking eight

813
00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:25.510
look like put people then.

814
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.690
But people like in the fifties and sixties they weren't necessarily talking

815
00:47:28.691 --> 00:47:30.160
about how common

816
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.730
<v 1>it is for people to do it on a p on the golden age of television,</v>

817
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:38.470
they didn't talk about golden shower.
Speaking of a golden age,

818
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:42.130
let's talk about a new trends I had a long time ago.

819
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.720
I hide this drum teacher and I actually put this in that book that we wrote.

820
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.460
And uh,
this guy was like 70 years old or something.

821
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.890
I had a girlfriend and I missed a lesson and he said,
ah,
he goes a stiff prick,

822
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:56.560
has no conscious,
and he was breaking my balls and he goes,
so what?

823
00:47:56.561 --> 00:47:58.690
She looked like,
let me here.
So I told them the story.

824
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:03.610
So he starts laughing and he starts telling me this fucking story of how a 72

825
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:08.260
year old guy,
all right,
this is a back end,
like the fucking nineties so you know,

826
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:12.750
this guy was born in the,
in the 20s and he was telling the story.
He goes,
yeah,

827
00:48:12.751 --> 00:48:17.751
he used to bang this blonde haired green eyed chick in the park up against the

828
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:19.750
tree and blah.

829
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:22.660
And I sat there with my fucking jaw on the ground cause I'm looking at,

830
00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:26.310
the guy looked like Santa Claus
and then he just,

831
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.130
I was like,
people did that back then.
And he just said,
he's like,

832
00:48:31.131 --> 00:48:32.030
let me tell you something kid.

833
00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.230
Every generation thinks they're the first generation that ever,
fuck.

834
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:39.040
And you went on this whole blog thing,
everything's been done.
It's all fucking,

835
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:42.700
you know.
And so I don't think,
uh,
you know,

836
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.350
I'm not defendant doing something like that,

837
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.030
but it's definitely not a new phenomenon.
But I spoke fucking Chuck Berry.

838
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.500
We have a little respect here.
I absolutely,

839
00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:53.420
absolutely fucking peed on her inner mouth.

840
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:56.470
She sounded like she was getting peed on.

841
00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:00.820
Maybe that's why he's eyes fucking went wide.
He was probably getting roused.
Oh,

842
00:49:00.821 --> 00:49:05.000
Jesus.
All right,
we're going to end on that.
All right.
That's the Nia log.

843
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:09.820
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
And,
uh,
I hope you had a happy post Thanksgiving week.

844
00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.620
Happy holidays.
Let me buddy.
Oh,
that's what you said.
That's what you said.
And,
uh,

845
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:16.950
you're,
you're,
you're,
when I was talking to me again,

846
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.590
I had thanksgiving for breakfast and that was the best,

847
00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:24.460
and everybody just fucking has always flies right to you.
Like a Goddamn light.

848
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:29.140
Everybody loves you.
Who doesn't relate to have leftovers for breakfast?

849
00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.880
What about him?
We went to no doubt that concert,
right?
Yeah.

850
00:49:33.881 --> 00:49:35.190
We went to go see trashed.

851
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:39.580
I went to a no doc content pasta make possibly make the very next night and I

852
00:49:39.581 --> 00:49:43.290
ever dealt.
We went horseback riding on my birthday because we're a couple,

853
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:47.320
we do couple type cutesy shit near this is 50 fucking minutes long.

854
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:51.180
The epilogue is 15 minutes long.
Oh No,
we should end it.
Yeah,
we should end it.

855
00:49:51.181 --> 00:49:53.570
All right.
All right.
You guys go fuck yourselves.
See you.
