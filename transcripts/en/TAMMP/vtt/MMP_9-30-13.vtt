00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:15.350
How's it going?
Did you have a nice weekend?
I had a great weekend.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.250
Do you like when somebody does that to you where they act like they want to know

6
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.000
what your weekends like so they can just talk about their bullshit,
you know?

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.890
Did you guys have a nice weekend?
I did.
Well,

8
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.610
let me tell you all the awesome fucking Shit I did.
Hang on,
let me get my juice.

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.550
I got to get my juice Sovi here so I stay regular.
Ow.

10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.270
Fuck God dammit.

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.580
You gotta be shitting me.
I just spilled it all over my fucking drunk kit.

12
00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:45.160
What an asshole.
Yeah,
Jesus Christ.
Well,
you know what?

13
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:46.180
I had a great weekend.

14
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.690
Fucking weeks not starting off by the time this podcast is over.
This is quite,

15
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:54.100
it's gonna be all sticky.
Really?

16
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.610
Did it really have to fucking land there?
Juice gods?

17
00:00:57.611 --> 00:01:00.520
I just dumped it over again trying to set it down the fucking rug.

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.160
All right,
hang on.
I got to hit pause here,
son of a buck.

19
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.990
All right.
I'm back.
And Jesus Christ that once but twice.

20
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.420
You know what an asshole don't Jake,
doesn't it the fucking worst?

21
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:19.830
Just owning shit.
I bet.
When you didn't own anything,
if you're young right now,

22
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:24.360
you don't own something.
You fucking spill some.
You don't give a shit.
Eh,

23
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:29.100
I'll get it later.
I said I'll get it later now.

24
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:31.040
I've got to be all concerned.
It's fucking hilarious.

25
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:35.790
Just see this stuff on drinking spilled on the rug.
Looks like God damn.

26
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:37.590
Extra sisters like nothing left.

27
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.780
Crisis was gonna be my breakfast.
Um,

28
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.540
yeah,
it was in Chicago this weekend,
right?

29
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.110
So I ate like a pig because that's what you do there.

30
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.400
You eat like a fucking pig and you grow a mustache even though nobody has a

31
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:57.540
mustache out there that I saw.
Um,
and they weren't really fat either,

32
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.860
but I got to work at the,
uh,
the beautiful,
uh,

33
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.990
Chicago theater did two shows out there and um,

34
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.490
I'm not going to lie to you.
It was a little overwhelming.
That was,
uh,

35
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.521
I got to tell you,

36
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.850
it's like Royal Albert Hall is something that I would try and compare it to.

37
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.370
I took a tour that one time when I was out there in London for you,

38
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:22.050
led Zeppelin fans,
fans of led Zeppelin.
If you wear a watch that,

39
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.950
oh that,
that fucking video too,
which to me is a new one,

40
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:29.280
but had already came out 10 years ago,
um,

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.720
that has all their concert footage up one from 1970.
That's where that is filmed.

42
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.350
Royal Albert Hall.
And as far as the states go,

43
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:41.160
the closest thing that we have to that would be the Chicago theater.

44
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.260
And I got to perform in it and it was pretty awesome.

45
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.880
And that's the end of that story.
I'm still fucking pissed about this.

46
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.171
It was a great time.

47
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:52.320
So I want to thank everybody for coming out there and you know what sucks is I

48
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.680
was so fucking overwhelmed,
I forgot I was going to sing when I came out there.

49
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.020
You know how it's going to come out and be like,

50
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.200
now kid only happen to a guy like baby booboo.

51
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.130
And only happened and uh,

52
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.940
so let me say too,
we told you,
um,

53
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.460
I could have done that,

54
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.200
could add a great fucking time and I forgot because I was too busy going like,

55
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.660
hey man,
I gotta make sure I do a good job here man.

56
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:23.890
This is like one of these big ones.
Um,
so anyways,
you probably asked yourself,

57
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.753
hey bill,

58
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.990
other than the usual feminine aspects of your personality,

59
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.700
why is it that you're drinking juice

60
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.940
<v 2>breakfast?
Why is it um,
uh,
I dunno why.</v>

61
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.070
Cause I eat like shit this weekend and then,
uh,
I dunno,

62
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:45.840
I ate something last week that my,
uh,

63
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:46.674
I dunno.

64
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.540
<v 1>I Dunno.
My body treated it like a,
a terrorist cell.
It was like,
well,</v>

65
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.250
you need to get these fuckers out of this country immediately

66
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.710
<v 2>and we don't care how many innocent people we have to take with it.
All right,</v>

67
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.620
there's going to be some collateral damage here.
Okay.

68
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.450
Everything in this sector has to go,
but we did that.
I said,
get Outta here.

69
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.560
All right.
For like four hours last week.

70
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.640
And it was such an effective,

71
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.130
like my body will basically committed genocide on my,

72
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.850
my large intestine,
there was nothing left.
Okay.

73
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.290
So like three to the point,
like three days later,

74
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.830
I don't want to get all graphic here three days later,
you know,

75
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.030
they'll basically,
other than I'll try to say this as nicely as possible,

76
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:43.660
other than watching a game that was real or if I was tired,
there was no reason,

77
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:47.200
full red face here to have to sit down,
if you know what I mean.

78
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.840
But like three straight days.
So now I think like,
well wait a minute.

79
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:54.480
So what happened?
So now if I got gotten the other way at our,
my end,
uh,

80
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.040
you know,
I went from fucking what wide open to to,
you know,
it's like a Justin,

81
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.620
a carburetor was too rich and now now and might get nothing.

82
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.540
<v 1>I got the choke pulled all the way out here.
Is that,</v>

83
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.550
what the fuck's going on here?
I got no way down there.

84
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.890
So I'm freaking out and I'm like,
I've been fucking eating salads trying to,

85
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.843
you know,

86
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.720
<v 2>so,
uh,
I talked to this doctor and he goes,</v>

87
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.810
and the guy just broke the thing down.
He goes,
all right,
so what happened?

88
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:28.430
I was like,
well,
you know,
four days ago,

89
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.490
it's so funny when you have to call a doctor about that.
Like,

90
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:34.400
how do you eloquently say like,
yeah,
listen,
man,
I haven't like shit.

91
00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:36.980
And four days,
is that a,
is that a bad thing?

92
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.080
And they just handle it like a chair.

93
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.320
<v 1>All right,
well,
what happened five days ago?</v>

94
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.180
I was shitting my brains out for like four hours.
You know,

95
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.490
it was like the,
uh,
the DOTCOM boom,

96
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.050
and everybody thought it was gonna last forever and it just,
it,
the bubble burst.

97
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.943
Now it's nothing.

98
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.080
<v 2>So he's like,
well,
you haven't any abdominal pain.
Uh,</v>

99
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 1>the are running a fever.
I'm like,
nope,
nope.
Well,
he goes,
wait a minute.</v>

100
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.650
And I've go,
I've been eating salads,
and it goes,
all right,
well,

101
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.290
you probably don't want to do that.
You don't need any more roughage.

102
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.640
You want something else?
And he said,
you need,
he actually said,
Syrup said,

103
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.260
go out,
get yourself some pancakes.
I'll go have a waffle or something like that.

104
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.810
Elicit,
you don't need to fuck it.

105
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:20.840
Tell me more than one time to go out and get some fucking pancakes.
All right.

106
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.000
With my sweet tooth.
Okay.

107
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:25.310
I'm a little light in the loafers over here when it comes to food.

108
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.020
I don't mind a little sugar in my tank.
I was like,
all right,
fuck it.

109
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.110
So I'm in Chicago,
so I go out and I go to get,

110
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.500
I need,
I need some syrup.
All right?
So I can't go down to the front desk and say,

111
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.790
hey listen,
I need some syrup because,
uh,
you know,

112
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.500
the old Bose not playing any music anymore,
if you know what I mean here.
And um,

113
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.000
you know,
if that even made sense,
I would have,
I'm running out of metaphors here,

114
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.380
not saying I'm having shit.
So I don't know.
I just asked that content,

115
00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:00.710
my phone where the nearest diner is.
She's like,

116
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.440
I found 47 locations and then just,
you know,
carpet bombs,

117
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.583
the screen.

118
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.180
So I pick one that's like about 0.3 miles away and I will go in there,

119
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.150
go and maybe I'll just go in there and get a shot of syrup with an orange juice

120
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:18.320
chaser.
And I said,
no,
fuck it.
I'll get,
I'll get some French toast.

121
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.393
So anyways,

122
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.120
I'm down near the Chicago theater and there's this weird part of the city where

123
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.850
there's like a city underneath the city.
I don't get it.

124
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:29.720
So I'm walking over towards it and you know the phone isn't three dimensional,

125
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:32.480
so it's saying right there,
but it's actually one level down.

126
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.350
It almost looked like a blade runner.

127
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.900
So I'm sitting there of course cursing up a storm around children and families

128
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:44.260
of course comes fucking stupid ass fucking phone number.

129
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.450
Back in the fucking day you just ask somebody where the fuck's the diner and

130
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:50.420
they'd be like,
oh it's Dan,
but it's downstairs so you've got to walk down here.

131
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.350
<v 0>Okay,</v>

132
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.710
<v 1>let's suppose this can't just go,
oh it's right over here.
Nickeled left do this.</v>

133
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.770
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

134
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.760
<v 1>you off.
Siri doesn't care.
The surgery,
whatever.
Fucking,
he's just give a shit.</v>

135
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:04.320
If you fall,
if rappelling is involved,
she doesn't give a fuck.

136
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.330
All right,
well that's not her fault.

137
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.430
She's only as smart as the man that made her.
Um,

138
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.690
so anyways,
I find the stairs,
I'm flipping out,
of course there's stairs.

139
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.000
I go down the goddamn stairs.
So I walk in and I,
uh,

140
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.470
I dunno.
I,
I ordered some French toast
and you would thank,
you know,

141
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:28.400
it will be the size.

142
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:32.960
The French toast would be the size of a sandwich bread like it is in most
places.

143
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:37.310
But this is the Midwest particularly I say that might particularly,

144
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.280
uh,
Chicago and I swear to God,

145
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.550
the French toast shows up and it looks like,
you know,

146
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.380
it'd be like,
if they decided how big should that the French toasts be,

147
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.880
and it'd be like,
hey,
does anybody have one,

148
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:51.880
a Bubba's Smith's old fucking clique's?

149
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.620
Let's just stick that in the batter and trace it.

150
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:56.730
And that'll be a how big the fucking bread should be.

151
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.940
Can you trace shit and batter?
I guess you can't have stick enough.
Oh yeah.
Well,

152
00:09:00.941 --> 00:09:03.270
let's trace the Brett around.
I'm just saying it was fucking huge.

153
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.130
And then they gave me two slices,
his left and right foot with powdered sugar.

154
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.110
And I ordered an egg over easy on the side,
cause I like eggs.

155
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:14.310
And I got to tell you something,
man.

156
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.650
I went to his place called Eggy all terrible fucking name.
Hey,

157
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:20.970
let's go over to fucking eggy.
It.

158
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.610
Doesn't that sound like they're going to be runny.
I got to tell you,

159
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.050
the greatest egg over easy I ever had in my life.

160
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.730
The Yolk was eg.
Hey,
take it age.
They get AIG.
The egg,

161
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.720
the Yolk was fucking easy.
But the,

162
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.520
the white part of the egg was,
um,

163
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.530
the Areola of the egg was fucking solid.
I don't know how they did it.
I was like,

164
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:48.270
maybe it had the heat real high,
so bright before the fucking yoke.
It's solid.

165
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:52.230
The white park,
it's all hard had.
And then they slip it out.
I have no idea.

166
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:54.810
But it was fucking delicious.
And I'm one of those guys,

167
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:59.100
I need a piece of toast if I'm going to have an egg and I didn't have toast and

168
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:03.800
it was still delicious,
still delicious.
And then I ate one of the French toast.

169
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:08.220
Thanks.
And I left the other cleat to the French toast hall of fame.
All right.

170
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:12.600
And wasn't,
should know what you know,
three hours later.

171
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.680
Okay,
well Billy was making music out the other end again.

172
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.900
And that's the end of my giant shit story.
All right?

173
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:21.720
This is the Monday morning podcast,
everybody.
So there's one for you.

174
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.680
If you have any shit your fucking brains out,
and then you know,

175
00:10:25.681 --> 00:10:28.080
and you're still eating well the next few days and you haven't gone,

176
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.950
go get yourself a shot.
A syrup with an orange juice chaser.
All right?

177
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.870
And you're going to be right as rain.
Okay.
Now granted,

178
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:41.250
after four days,
roadkill is coming out of here it is.
It's disgusting.
Um,

179
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.470
I let me get a shot at UCL.
That's a good stuff.

180
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.273
<v 3>MMM.</v>

181
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.420
<v 1>So anyways,
what else?
What else do I want to talk about?
Oh,
last night.
Hey,</v>

182
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.010
breaking bad is over.
I want to be in the nine millions person to talk about it.

183
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:59.600
But Jesus Christ wasn't a great ending.
I loved it.

184
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.900
I thought they uh,
I thought they stuck the landing.

185
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:06.800
I'm not going to ruin for everybody cause they're east.
What?
Lowly yard cc too.

186
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.890
It's been out for six years.
Jesus,
I don't know.
You know what?

187
00:11:12.891 --> 00:11:14.660
I've never watched an episode of lost.

188
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.900
Have you seen lost now?
I haven't.
I haven't.

189
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:25.190
Every time I put it on it's that guy with the giant head in the Paula Malo

190
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:28.040
haircut and I can't figure out what the fuck's going on.

191
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:30.560
And then the captain from Star Trek is being evil.

192
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.320
That's all I know that goes on on that show.

193
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.180
So I have empathy so I'm not going to say anything but um,
it was great.

194
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.900
It was a great fucking time getting to be on that show and a half.

195
00:11:44.411 --> 00:11:46.940
Fuck.
I mean there's no way to talk about it unless somebody saw the shelf.

196
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.680
Why the hell they bring it up anyways,
so there you go.

197
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.670
The show's over and I am unemployed as an actor again.

198
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.140
And that is why that is why you well know.

199
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.210
That's why I would never stop doing stand up even if I didn't love it is because

200
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:11.560
trying to be a working actor is that difficult that you can be on something that

201
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:15.190
great and then it just fucking ends and it's over like stand up.

202
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.940
That doesn't happen.
Like if,
if I was doing standup at the level of breaking bad,

203
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.500
that wouldn't be like,

204
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:23.960
okay and this is your final standup Gig and then it drops off again.

205
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:28.990
I go right down to ground zero and have to look for more standup gigs and like

206
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.410
prove myself all over again.
I've often wondered like try it.

207
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.540
What's the hardest either it's either trying to make it as far as show business,

208
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.570
either trying to make it as an actor or trying to make it in a band bands a

209
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.780
rough one because you've got to split the money at least three ways,

210
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.390
you know,
unless you're in the uh,

211
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.970
the black keys or if you're in the white stripes,
then you split it two ways.

212
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.540
But still you got to get along with somebody else.
All right?

213
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.740
And the more people you have and you've banned the biggest chance that it's just

214
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:06.440
all going to go to shit.
Look at guns and roses.
All right?

215
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.970
They had five people in the band.
All right?
They start fighting.

216
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.950
So a couple of guys leave,
one guy gets asked to leave,
another guy says,
hey,

217
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:19.690
I don't like being dictated to.
So he takes off.
No Steven,
no Izzy.

218
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.700
So they bring in fucking Matt Sorum and Gilby cluck.
Right?

219
00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.990
So you got five guys and what do they do when they bring in a keyboard is dizzy.

220
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.520
They got in horn players.

221
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.530
All it is is more people to be late to come downstairs to get on the fucking bus

222
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.720
and the whole thing implodes.
Everybody goes their separate ways.
Right?

223
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.950
And next thing you know,
axle has cornrows.
Okay?

224
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:49.951
Now had that guy decided to just tell jokes just to do stand up,

225
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.300
you know,
which would've been great.

226
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.210
When would be great to see some actual doing stand up.

227
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.430
Every time he tells a joke that gets an applause break.

228
00:13:57.431 --> 00:13:59.350
He does it a little surf at dance to decide.

229
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.480
I'm really trying to think of a joke that ends with Shannon.

230
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.570
You know where he could fucking,
I dunno.
Um,
let me pay nice sketch.

231
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.600
Axl Rose is a stent.
If he proposes a stand up comedian,

232
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.880
he come on late.

233
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:23.230
He'd probably still fuck it up not to have a little red on red crime here.

234
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:24.803
All right.

235
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.600
<v 3>Okay.</v>

236
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.670
<v 1>You got to hate when people do that.
Yeah,
you got to hate one.</v>

237
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.510
It becomes cannibalism here.
I just completely lost my train of thought.
Oh,

238
00:14:32.511 --> 00:14:35.090
I know what I was going to say.
Wait a minute.
How far into the salary?

239
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.500
About 15 minutes in it's time to do a couple of reads here,
people.
All right.

240
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.460
It's time to time to whore myself out.
All right,
let's do a couple here.

241
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:45.110
All right.
Dollar Shave club,
everybody.

242
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.800
There was so many things in the world that irritate me.

243
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.070
Spilling juice on my kit.
I don't have a drum

244
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.960
<v 2>kit.
It's a little practice pad thing,
but I got,</v>

245
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.190
I do have the DW 5,000 double kick there.
Right?

246
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.580
When I finally got fed up 10 years ago that I was never going to have a foot

247
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.280
fast,
fastest John Bonham.
And he said to hell with it,

248
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.500
let me try to do this speed metal stuff.
And that was just as hard,
right?

249
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.310
So now I got this double pedal and it's just sitting there like you remember

250
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:15.140
those hair metal bands in the 80s,

251
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.970
whether they'd be just play in to four basic Phil Rudd stuff,

252
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:23.530
but they still did double bass drum kit.
So when they did the,
uh,

253
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.590
the drum solo,
that could just be running underneath it and sound like,
you know,

254
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.620
Neil Pure,
whenever the fuck,
when did,
when did they become part?
You're pure it.

255
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.640
Neil peered,
I don't know where it was.
Neil Park,
the whole,

256
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:36.320
his whole fucking career.
Not,
I know,

257
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.910
that irritates me and it's not Neil part anymore.
It's near peer.
Um,

258
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.680
so those are the things that irritate me.
Pay.

259
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.170
But when so many things can irritate you,

260
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.780
why ed raises to the list,
you know,

261
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.030
it's time to stop milking your razor blades.

262
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:55.340
People I know with brand name razors,

263
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:58.730
you used to paying outrageous prices and exhausting those razors and until they

264
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:02.240
start looking like a rusty soda kid,
well guess what?
It's time to move on.

265
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.680
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing quality blades to your door for just a few

266
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:09.670
bucks a month.
Never think about it again.
All right.

267
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.590
You just stand in that bank bong.
They should blades for a month.

268
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.180
They send you a pack every month so you can change your blades every week.

269
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.600
That's awesome man.
That's one of,
why didn't I think of doing this.

270
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.860
I went up to jump around like a monkey on stage every damn week.
Anyways,

271
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:27.050
I love these guys and your face is going to love them too.

272
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.810
They also got a new product called one wipe Charlies.

273
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.030
It's about white for men and it's classic.
All right.

274
00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:38.840
As opposed to that low class toilet play paper,
just hanging around,
you know,

275
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.040
one wipe Charlie,
get in and get out.
All right,
the Harvey Keitel,

276
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:47.870
the cleaner if you will,
of toilet paper and it,

277
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:50.870
okay.
Check out the video for that.
Sign up for your razors today.

278
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.400
Go to dollar shave club.com,
forward slash burr.

279
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:59.810
forward slash for Ortho to billboard.com and Click on the dollar shave club

280
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:03.260
banner.
I almost made it through it.
Um,
you know what a one wipe Charlie is?

281
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:08.261
That's basically America's slowly admitting that the French got it right with

282
00:17:08.851 --> 00:17:10.760
the bad day.
Okay?

283
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:14.930
What we're doing over here with toilet paper is ridiculous.
I'm telling you,

284
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.420
if you ever get into a hotel and there's a,
there's a big day,
um,

285
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.160
make yourself take the dozen books,
just a big shit podcast.
I'm telling you,

286
00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:26.540
you got to use one and you'll be like,
what the hell have I been doing?
You know,

287
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.550
with my life,

288
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.910
although I'd maintained that French people are still more sticky than we are

289
00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:35.300
because they don't use deodorant and who's getting hurt when you have a question

290
00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:39.530
in class,
you don't spread your ass cheek.
All right?
I think everyone can agree.

291
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.940
You raise your arm.
All right?

292

Wasn't that Nice and painless?
All right.

315
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.080

All right,

316
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:15.240
I'm the real deal.

318
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.940
Cause I'm a lefty sort of.
I'm also a writer.

319
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.090
I'm all over the map.
God Damn it.
This fucking juice.
It's delicious.
Kale,
celery,

320
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.060
green,
apple,
coriander.

321
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.840
The fuck is that Parsley in line?
What the Hell is coriander?

322
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.580
I can't be a spice.
Can't get any juice out of a spice.

323
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.580
That's the Dandruff or food spices,
right?

324
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:48.010
Anybody have a dandruff and an Omelet,
you know,
prisoner of war.
Like,
Oh,

325
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.680
it's disgusting.
Um lets

326
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.720
you use dandruff is powdered sugar as you put it on like a wood shingle,

327
00:19:57.721 --> 00:20:02.160
pretending it was French toast.
That's like just some greatest generation shit.

328
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.600
And they did it and then they never talked about it and then subconsciously took

329
00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:11.430
it out on their kids.
Um,
and then you've got the baby boom generation,

330
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.150
bunch of fucking cry babies.
Oh my God.

331
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:17.370
Was there ever a bigger pussy generation than them?

332
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.340
We don't want to go to war.

333
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.820
I just making up shit.
People don't take this seriously.
Oh you can,

334
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.650
but I don't give a fuck.
Uh,
oh.

335
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.640
So let's talk about what a cunt I am.
I'm driving down to get my juice today,

336
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.720
my medicine and um,
you know,

337
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.870
someone was texting me and all this type of shit.

338
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.430
<v 3>Okay.</v>

339
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:46.840
<v 1>And I'm trying not to text while I drive,</v>

340
00:20:46.841 --> 00:20:50.100
but do my text him back like I can't tell you podcast today.

341
00:20:50.101 --> 00:20:53.470
I'll do it next week doing Kevin Farley's podcast next week,

342
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.280
yet another person on the all things comedy network.
Um,

343
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.200
so by the way,
I'll be on that next week.
So anyways,

344
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.480
I'm driving over to the juice bar and I pull in,

345
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.040
I get the juice,
throw the bag,

346
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.790
come back out and there's like nobody there.

347
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.970
I got a great parking spot and all I want to do is just whip around,

348
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:19.240
do a u turn right.
Like I'm Adam 12 every time they got a call,

349
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:21.790
they will never go in the right direction.
They always had turnaround.
Right.

350
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.050
And you just can't,
it's like a fucking out here in la.
I swear to God.

351
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:29.140
It's like the God Damn Truman show and says,

352
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:32.410
just know what the fuck you going to do.
So I go to do it and out of nowhere,

353
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:36.520
this fucking jerk off.
He just appears right.

354
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.510
Right out of the fucking air.
And not only does he blocked me from doing it,

355
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.400
like I'm just starting to pull out a little bit.

356
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.740
He's pulls into the parking spot right in front of me,

357
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.620
front end first and almost takes off my front end.

358
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.110
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

359
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.780
<v 1>he didn't like when you almost get into an accident even when you're wrong,</v>

360
00:21:51.781 --> 00:21:56.190
cause I was wrong.
I should've looked,
he had the right away.
But you get mad.

361
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.630
Like I flipped out.
I just,
cause I got scared like,
Oh my God,

362
00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:04.140
I'm gonna rip off the front of my car.
And then it didn't happen.
I was like,
Oh,

363
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:09.450
you start flipping out then and as you yelling at the guy inside your car,

364
00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:12.900
there's that voice in the back of your head going,
you were wrong.

365
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.670
You were the wrong one.
That happened like three times,

366
00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.250
just fucking jerk off in front of me.

367
00:22:20.251 --> 00:22:24.450
I'd go around the block and he's doing that,
driving what?
You know that texting,

368
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.040
you know,
sort of creeping along and then,

369
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:31.260
and then all of a sudden I know we're going real fast.

370
00:22:31.261 --> 00:22:33.650
All of a sudden they're a good drive and then they completely suck at driving.

371
00:22:33.651 --> 00:22:37.110
Then there it's like they're sober,
they're drunk,
they're sober,
that drunk.

372
00:22:37.111 --> 00:22:40.110
That is fucking classic texting while driving.

373
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.510
And I pull up alongside of the guy,
look at him.
Sure enough,

374
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:46.140
he's looking down as he's driving and I'm going to go look at this fucking idiot

375
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.030
texted while driving.

376
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:49.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

377
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.500
<v 1>And literally I had been doing it a half mile earlier,</v>

378
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.710
probably making the same person do that.
I'm such a fucking hypocritical cont,

379
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.580
you know,
at least I guess maybe I can hear it.
Who the hell is texting me?

380
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.660
Jesus Christ,
these people.
No,

381
00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:06.160
I still choose all of my rug and I don't have time for texts.

382
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:07.783
<v 3>MMM.</v>

383
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.860
<v 1>Anyways,
so,
uh,
I don't even know if I even said it.</v>

384
00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:14.180
I want to thank everybody who came out to,
uh,

385
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.600
the Chicago theater this weekend,
that that was an unbelievable,

386
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.930
unbelievable experience and I definitely took a lot of photos,

387
00:23:21.931 --> 00:23:26.340
took a lot of video because that's one of those things where you're doing it and

388
00:23:26.341 --> 00:23:29.460
you're like,
am I ever going to get to do this again?

389
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:35.070
It was insane.
Um,
and if you ever get a chance to go to Chicago,

390
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:35.581
here's a great,

391
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:39.720
there's a great little weekend trip for those of you who don't live there.

392
00:23:39.721 --> 00:23:42.480
And Chicago is basically,
I know it's a little more east coast,

393
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:43.300
but essentially it's,

394
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.900
it's no more than a four hour flight for in the lower 48 here.
Um,

395
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.700
if you favorite band is playing there,
that would be a great weekend going there.

396
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.470
See your favorite band at the Chicago theater and then hang out and eat.

397
00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:00.290
They're awesome heart attack food.
Uh,

398
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.570
which I didn't even get a chance to do because of,
uh,

399
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.070
the earlier story and also I flew in that day.
Oh,

400
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:10.430
you know what the fuck I should have taken the weekend there,
but I'm too busy.

401
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:11.840
I'm going right back up this weekend.

402
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:18.130
The El Paso Gig people is happening trying to happen again for the third fucking

403
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:20.564
time.

404
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.920
I've already lost two fans for life because of this Gig.

405
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.940
But I am determined.

406
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.590
I am determined that I'm going to make this thing happen.
And uh,

407
00:24:33.591 --> 00:24:36.280
the Gig is on Wednesday and uh,

408
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.730
last time it was going to be Paul Versey who is going to open for me.
Uh,

409
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.150
he's busy this time around,
um,
bringing,
uh,

410
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.830
the Rosebowl tailgate king.
All right.

411
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:54.200
The Sinatra of our rose bolt tailgate.
Uh,
Joe Barton.

412
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:56.570
Nick is coming out and uh,

413
00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.430
this guy is one of my favorite people and one of the funniest people I've ever

414
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:02.151
met in my life.

415
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:06.920
He's funny when he's trying to be funny and he's funny even when he's not trying

416
00:25:06.921 --> 00:25:10.370
to be funny.
He's a total fucking original.

417
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.250
Really just lives by his own code is just a,
it's fucking awesome man.

418
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:20.200
He's a throwback throwback to a different era.
Um,

419
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.400
so he's going to be coming out there.
I'm actually,
believe it or not,

420
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:23.510
I'm going to drive out there.

421
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.840
That's how beautiful the drive from El Paso to San Antonio was.

422
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.210
I got to see the rest of this.

423
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.410
I got to see the rest of the south west side driving La to El Paso.

424
00:25:33.411 --> 00:25:36.860
It's like a 12 hour drive,
which that's not,
that's not bad.
You know,

425
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.320
he just break it up,
break it up.
But I'm,

426
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:44.180
I'm timing it where I'm going to be out in the desert as the sun's going down.

427
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.290
Uh,
look at me drinking juice,
trying to see,
is that right?

428
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.990
Am I evolving as a man or am I a,

429
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.250
am I going to start going on stage like Duran Duran wearing a little bit of

430
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:57.290
makeup?
That wouldn't be bad,
right.
A little eyeliner.

431
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.370
What'd you guys do if I went that direction at all my,
all my,

432
00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:02.870
I stopped talking about it's about sports.

433
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:06.230
I went that direction and then all of a sudden everybody was saying that I was

434
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:11.150
ripping off.
Eddie Izzard
is a left turn,

435
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.990
you know,
or Bryan Adams after,
you know,

436
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:17.810
he came out and he was wearing a jean jacket looking like the guy that might

437
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:21.320
have some weed and then all of a sudden he decided I can't,
you know,

438
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.790
he became more poppy.
Everything you'd do.
I,
everything I do,

439
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:28.940
I do it for you.
That's one of the saddest fucking songs ever.

440
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.630
Just completely lost in a relationship.
You've completely,
you know,

441
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.560
you know his friends.
Hey,
should we call a Bryant?
Nah.
Nah.
You know,

442
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.450
once you have it sets,
he met Julie.
You know,
Jeez is fine.

443
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.880
Never thought it would happen to him.
Remember that we used to fucking,
you know,

444
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.810
you should get fucked up in the barn,
right?

445
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.390
Whatever the fuck they did in that video.

446
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.650
And then somewhere along the line he spiked up his hair and put on some
eyeliner,

447
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.800
Jesus Christ.
You know,
when he was making that video,

448
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:00.450
he was just saying to his manager,
like,
dude,

449
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:03.450
this is either the beginning or the end,
uh,

450
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.730
this better fucking work in the manager's probably be like,
Nah,
I said,

451
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.030
great thing.
It's a great fucking thing.
And then when it's shit,

452
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:13.380
the bed manager can't be found,
where the hell is he?
All right,

453
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.280
let's talk NFL football.
Uh,
unfortunately I didn't really see any this week.
I,

454
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.710
I was flying back from,
uh,

455
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.380
Chicago when all the early games were on and then,
um,

456
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.340
my patriots will late night and I ain't even get a chance to see that because

457
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:29.851
this is what I did.

458
00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:34.620
I came home and I got caught up on the scores just in time.

459
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.310
I haven't really seen the highlights to see Seattle's big comeback or the Texans

460
00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:43.020
big choke depending on what side of the ball you're on.
Um,

461
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.470
I know the jets lost.
Uh,

462
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:49.860
all I saw was the first quarter and a half of the Patriots.
And,
um,

463
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:54.750
I'm happy that we were able to get past the falcons cause I feel like that's the

464
00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:59.600
first quality team that we've played.
But,
um,
I dunno,

465
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.330
I already saw somebody was trying to say that we're the only ones going to

466
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.390
legitimately challenged the Broncos and I don't think it's going to be much,

467
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.930
I don't know.
You never know when Belichick is involved,

468
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.340
what scheme he can come up with and God knows you can frustrate Peyton manning

469
00:28:14.341 --> 00:28:19.110
but they look fucking amazing.
So,

470
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.760
uh,
I wish that the Broncos would just play Seattle already cause I want to see,

471
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.870
you know,
two things.
I want to see Seattle on the road against the team,

472
00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:30.750
that good cause versus has been telling me they're not good on the road.

473
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.070
He almost called it with the Texans.
They didn't fucking choke.
Um,

474
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:37.530
I saw the picture on nfl.com.
It's hilarious.

475
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.470
Is a Sherman the beasts,
they're running the ball back and you get to see,

476
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.570
you get to see Pete Carroll.
Pete Carol is in full,

477
00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:53.571
like I can't tell if you just finished going woo or if he's about ready to say

478
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:58.140
it.
Uh,
but they,
uh,

479
00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.110
they look and like fucking world beaters up there.
I got,
oh by the way,

480
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:03.540
I'm going to be up in Seattle this week and uh,

481
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.280
this is going to be fucking hilarious cause it's,

482
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:08.730
I'm playing this awesome venue plus all the morning radio shows up there.

483
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.120
I think for the most part they,
they played when I was singing.

484
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:16.020
We are the loudest,
so there's a lot of pissed off.
Um,

485
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.950
12th man people out there.
So I dunno.
We're going to see.
We'll see.

486
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:24.090
What the fuck happens.
I don't give a shit either way to be honest with you.

487
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.340
Um,
if something goes down when I'm up there,
that's,

488
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.120
it's a very easy city to make fun of.
So I think I can do more than 12 minutes.

489
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.060
Um,
but I,
I'm hoping it's not going to be,
you know,

490
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:40.200
what is annoying about all those morning radio shows is all they did was like,

491
00:29:40.201 --> 00:29:42.640
now they'll just right there,
they won't have this part.

492
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.550
They left out the whole part where I said I thought that Seattle was going to go

493
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:49.390
to the Superbowl and they looked like the team to beat.
Um,

494
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.240
they lift that they left out where I,
you know,

495
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.950
didn't give Pete Carroll Shit for what the fuck he did at USC because everybody

496
00:29:56.951 --> 00:30:01.150
does it.
By the way,
people are still doing that spy gate shit bringing up,
uh,

497
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.690
you know,
bringing up Bella check and that type of thing.

498
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.810
Like they always love to do with the Patriots.
I was watching the Lsu game.

499
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.020
Unfortunately,
they lost a great game,

500
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.700
great fucking game against Georgia.
And uh,
took,
by the way,

501
00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:19.630
who the fuck did Georgia piss off with this September schedule?

502
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.660
Jesus Christ,
Clemson,
Lsu.

503
00:30:22.661 --> 00:30:27.160
And there was somebody else highly ranked that they played.
I forget who.
Um,

504
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.980
but anyways,
in the middle of the game,

505
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.330
like both coaches when they're talking dictate covenant,
that mouse,

506
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.160
the covering their lips as they're talking,
like,

507
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.230
like they were in casino and the announcers even go,

508
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:43.270
well they must have got word is something going on?

509
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:47.880
This is everybody fucking does it.
Some fucking reading when,
oh,

510
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.260
Seattle fans was giving me Shit I was talking about,
you know,

511
00:30:50.261 --> 00:30:52.420
cause I made fun of the team was sitting there talking about,
you know,

512
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.040
Bella check being a cheater.
It's like,
dude,

513
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:57.850
did you see what fucking Pete Carroll did down at USC?

514
00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.770
What the fuck he was doing?

515
00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:02.830
I don't give him grief about it because everybody was doing it.
But I mean,

516
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.060
come on right as the diggy a team was right as that was coming down,

517
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:08.620
he fucking slips out of town,

518
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.300
left all those kids high and dry with their scholarships and some no name coach

519
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.660
who I think just got fired.
Um,

520
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.860
how psyched to the Tennessee fans watching the fact that it didn't work out out

521
00:31:20.861 --> 00:31:24.160
there?
That's another shout out to Knoxville.
Jesus,

522
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:26.560
I'm going to go there one day and they're going to give me the key to this city

523
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.030
and wonder what it looks like.
You know,
am I going to do a redneck joke here?

524
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.650
I don't have one.
Let's plow ahead here.
Everybody.
Um,
so by the way,

525
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:40.630
so I didn't watch much football because a verse he kept telling me how amazing

526
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.930
the Lawrence Taylor,
uh,
documentary was and uh,

527
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.510
directed by the one and only Pete Radevich shoots the guy who got me on inside

528
00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:53.710
the NFL.
So congratulations to him because I've heard nothing but rave reviews.

529
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:57.190
And I sat down and watched it and it was fucking,
it was awesome.

530
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.070
It was really awesome.
And you know what,

531
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.680
I don't know if it was the way it was edited,

532
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:06.090
but there was a lot of shit that the media was doing to lt when he was,
uh,

533
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.190
under the influence that was bugging you don't really bothers me,

534
00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.640
is when somebody famous gets arrested and then the cops have to have a press

535
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:16.090
conference.
Why do they have to have a press conference?

536
00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:17.020
Why do they have to come out?

537
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:20.590
They would like 20 microphones and everybody taking pictures in the stupid

538
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:25.380
police chief comes out at approximately,
yeah.
Blend 28.
You Morty.

539
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:30.000
We lasted a Blab is Tracy and outside of a,

540
00:32:30.001 --> 00:32:34.630
a symphony hall with what we believe was allegedly,

541
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.770
uh,
crack cocaine.
Um,

542
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.590
why can't they just arrest him?
Why do they,

543
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.750
why do they have to have a fucking press conference?

544
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.660
Why do they got to go out there and whore themselves out?

545
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:52.010
Go into hair and makeup,
get some power to put it on their face,
right?

546
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:55.430
Slicked back the cop hair and walk out the plan to be fat.

547
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.840
Give hits 28 shut the fuck up.
You know,

548
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.170
and then all the media has to sit there while lt was going through.

549
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:04.930
His Shit is sitting there acting like this,

550
00:33:04.931 --> 00:33:07.940
shaking their head when they're totally exploiting the guy for ratings that

551
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:12.680
granted lt put himself out there like that to have it done.
But,
um,

552
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.380
I don't know.
When I have to tell you something in the documentary,

553
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.350
there's something that lts first wife does.

554
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:27.310
That is one of the things that I find most terrifying about,

555
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.860
uh,
women.
And,
uh,

556
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:32.300
<v 3>okay.</v>

557
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.270
<v 1>I don't want to ruin it for you,
but she says,</v>

558
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:40.540
lt cries at his daughter's wedding and she comments on his crying and then they

559
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:45.380
cut to the funeral and she reaches over and puts his,

560
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:50.381
her hand on his forearm to comfort him after what she had just said is one of

561
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:53.270
those fucking things that sends chills down my spine.

562
00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.830
But definitely check it out.
It's a,
it's fucking amazing.

563
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.723
And um,

564
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.900
if anybody knows just one of the cigars that Lt Smoking,

565
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:09.170
he looks like he smokes the greatest cigars of all to,

566
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:13.490
they have two bands on them.
Alright.
So on to me in my ignorance,

567
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:15.680
that's like the greatest cigar ever.
It's so good.

568
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:17.180
It had to have a second band on it.

569
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.633
<v 3>MMM.</v>

570
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.890
<v 1>I Dunno.
That's what I got.
I,
that's all I got out of it.</v>

571
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.820
That if I ever become a parent,
I gotta be there for my kids.
And secondly,

572
00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.280
I got to figure out where lts getting a cigars.

573
00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.440
But definitely check that out if you get a chance.

574
00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:35.160
And congratulations once again to Pete rat of it's for doing an unbelievable
job.

575
00:34:35.161 --> 00:34:37.800
That's one of those ones that immediately after I watched it,

576
00:34:37.801 --> 00:34:42.540
when I hit stop and it said if I wanted to erase it or not,
I hit save.

577
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:45.090
And you know,
you have that save indefinitely.

578
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.850
That's one of those ones I'm going to keep going back to because it was a,

579
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.210
it was tremendous.
All right,
where are we?

580
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.090
Are we going to get into the letters at this point?
And we at that time,

581
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:56.400
34 minutes then,
hey,

582
00:34:56.401 --> 00:34:59.310
how come you can't protest without getting teargassed shot at?
Yeah.

583
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.020
All around the world.
Get Out.
They act like you,
you know,

584
00:35:04.021 --> 00:35:08.500
we want to hear from our people and you go out there,
he just sitting out.

585
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:09.091
All you do with it,

586
00:35:09.091 --> 00:35:13.890
you got signs in your chanting and then the cops come down there and they start

587
00:35:13.891 --> 00:35:16.350
pushing people around and they throw fucking tear guests.

588
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.960
I don't understand why.
Why can't you do that?
Why aren't you allowed to protest?

589
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:23.071
Look,

590
00:35:23.071 --> 00:35:25.980
I understand if you go down there and you start breaking windows and that type

591
00:35:25.981 --> 00:35:29.370
of shit.
Um,
but I,
I actually believe,

592
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.430
and I know you guys are going to think that I'm paranoid,
if I was in power,

593
00:35:32.431 --> 00:35:35.820
I would just say,
hey,
how old your son is.

594
00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:38.490
Set them out there and have him throw a through the window so we can look

595
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:40.950
justified when we get rid of these fucking people out here.

596
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.953
<v 3>MMM.</v>

597
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.900
<v 1>Adam,
sorry,
I'm going back down the fucking rat hole again.</v>

598
00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:52.180
Somebody sent me a great rant that this guy went on on a news program and he was

599
00:35:52.181 --> 00:35:54.010
talking about the bankers.
Uh,

600
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.960
cause I can't even watch the news right now with our government might shut down

601
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:02.590
in a couple of days with this guy was basically going off saying all that

602
00:36:02.591 --> 00:36:06.700
bankers shit that I was trying to say a few years ago when I started watching

603
00:36:06.701 --> 00:36:08.650
those videos and everybody was saying,
Oh yeah,

604
00:36:08.651 --> 00:36:13.450
these are fucking fat guys living in their mother's basements who a,

605
00:36:13.451 --> 00:36:15.640
they don't have any lives.
And you just,
you know,

606
00:36:15.641 --> 00:36:19.360
you're drinking the Koolaid and all this shit that look,
a lot of that stuff.

607
00:36:19.361 --> 00:36:23.710
We never landed on the moon.
I'll give you all that shit.
Okay.

608
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.190
Maybe all of that stuff.
Nine 11 in inside job.

609
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:29.770
I'm not talking about any of that fucking crap,
but that bankers shit.

610
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.173
I'm telling you.

611
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:32.410
<v 3>Okay.</v>

612
00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:37.030
<v 1>That bankers shit is dead on dead fucking on.</v>

613
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.040
It's not the left.
It's not the right.

614
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.030
It's those cunts right in the middle with money on both sides of the ball.

615
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.370
It's those guys,
and I have to tell you,
dude,

616
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:51.070
the fact that the president only makes 400 grand a year and that just the way

617
00:36:51.071 --> 00:36:55.130
they frame it,
like,
oh,
he's a public servant.
It booked up.
It's,

618
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.280
it's the biggest crock of shit out there.

619
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.390
The only person who would take that job,

620
00:37:00.391 --> 00:37:03.660
you'd have to be the biggest fucking yes man on the planet just to get there.

621
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.250
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

622
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:06.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

623
00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.700
Who the fuck would run for a job where it costs 100 million to get it so you can

624
00:37:10.701 --> 00:37:12.140
make 400 grand a year.

625
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.580
<v 3>Okay.</v>

626
00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.500
<v 1>Yeah.
That isn't a red flag to anybody.</v>

627
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.220
Then you get to go around giving speeches $1 million.

628
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.550
A whack like that isn't yet kickback for fucking pushing through whatever they

629
00:37:22.551 --> 00:37:25.610
wanted.
I just think it's,
it's so beyond corrupt.

630
00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.213
<v 3>MMM.</v>

631
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.380
<v 1>And I used to think shit,</v>

632
00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:34.850
like I can't believe we're letting these pencil pushing banking pussies push us

633
00:37:34.851 --> 00:37:38.240
around,
but it's not them.
It's the fact that people will do anything for money.

634
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.650
So when you have that kind of money,
you can hire psychos and uh,
you know,

635
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.530
I dunno,
you get that,

636
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.930
you get that Lincoln town car ride the convertible in Dallas.
All right.

637
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.720
I spoke about it vaguely,
but you know what I'm saying.
All right,
let's,
let's,
uh,

638
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:55.370
let's move on.
Okay.

639
00:37:55.371 --> 00:37:58.460
Now I mentioned that I was going to go to Naples and I don't think I might as

640
00:37:58.461 --> 00:38:01.340
well have said that I was going to go with,
to Atlantic city.

641
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.970
<v 3>Okay.</v>

642
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.830
<v 1>All right.
Or downtown Detroit.</v>

643
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.220
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

644
00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.500
<v 1>Everybody is shitting all over Naples.</v>

645
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:09.980
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

646
00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.010
<v 1>All right.
Here's one that sums it up.
Uh,</v>

647
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:17.080
everyone says Naples is the worst words used to describe Naples ship.

648
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.680
Trash haul,
smell like smells like wet rats.
Great.

649
00:38:21.681 --> 00:38:26.120
If you're into visiting the worst part of any place.
If you do go to Naples,

650
00:38:26.121 --> 00:38:30.470
only use it as a jumping off point to Capri and Pompei.

651
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:31.990
<v 3>Okay?</v>

652
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.070
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean that's what everybody has been telling.
Everybody is saying,
look,</v>

653
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.340
if you're going to Italy for the first time,
go to Rome.
All right?

654
00:38:39.341 --> 00:38:42.640
You're going there and December.
So we won't be a big time touristy thing,

655
00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:47.320
but there will be tourists.
Use that as a jump off point.
Go to Florence.
I mean,

656
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:50.220
I heard Venice,
I mean the fucking place is underwater.
I heard that.

657
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:55.180
<v 2>You know,
or that that was kind of smelly.
I don't know.
But you know what?</v>

658
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:59.500
You guys,
you talked me out of Naples.
You talked me out of it.
Now,
watch,

659
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:02.710
now hear it comes to the other side.
Don't listen to those fucking assholes.

660
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:08.530
Whatever.
I've gone to Italy.
How could it possibly suck?
Smash.
Cut.

661
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:13.960
Alright,
refugee.
Here we go.
Ref.
Ah,
the lovely Nia.
Everybody.

662
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:18.040
Yeah.
Do you know I,
I spilt my juice all over the fucking place.

663
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.780
The green juice to Cleo.
Get off the bed.
Look at her nose.

664
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.750
A fucking dog tried to get out of the Goddamn cage again cause the wind was

665
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:33.470
blowing,
bumped up,
scratched up.
A frigging knows pimples.

666
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.610
I swear to God,
India.
Once they get their mind on doing something,

667
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.440
they're just going to do it right.
The brutal.
I didn't know you were coming down.

668
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.770
Go Plug in another microphone.
Let's do the,
uh,

669
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.870
let's do the thing here.
All right.
All right.
Do you have the ability to,

670
00:39:49.871 --> 00:39:50.704
uh,

671
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.880
do you have the ability to listen while a while?
I mean,

672
00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.330
why you plugged that thing in?
Yes.
All right.

673
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.750
All women think that they can multitask.
It's the funniest fucking thing ever.

674
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.520
I can,
you can,
you can't knit.
Well,
look,

675
00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:10.450
everybody could do two things at once.
You can't fucking Italian play drums.

676
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:15.310
I can do four things at once.
What are you doing?
That's the wrong one.
Okay.

677
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.300
We'll just continue on.
Huh?
Listen,

678
00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:24.010
scientific studies have shown that people studies have showed one of my favorite

679
00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:28.540
quotes of all time.
I actually saw this on TV that that basically,

680
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.580
if you do two things at once,

681
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.540
they both suffer because you don't have a hundred percent focus.

682
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:40.150
You know what I mean?
Does that make sense to you?
Yes,
it does.
Okay.

683
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:44.920
Am I on?
Yeah,
you are right.
All right.
Here we go.

684
00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:49.510
All right.
Hey Bill,
this is a refugee.
Hey.
Hey Bill.

685
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:52.000
I got to know you when I was a refugee in Turkey.

686
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.960
I escaped from prison.
What's,
yeah,
I dunno.

687
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.650
I listen everybody.
Everybody's got the Internet,
man.

688
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:03.910
You're the number one podcast for refugees,
refugees in Turkey.

689
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.000
<v 1>Yeah.
This sounds like the beginning of a movie.</v>

690
00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:07.890
I don't know if I'm going to believe this.
Suddenly.
Let's,
let's,

691
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.890
let's see if this is true.
I got to know you when I was a refugee in Turkey.

692
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.870
I escape from a prison sentence for my political activities in the university in

693
00:41:15.871 --> 00:41:16.704
Iran.

694
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.460
<v 2>Jesus Christ.
Dude,
somebody's got to get this guy in touch with Ben Affleck.</v>

695
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.550
<v 1>Sounds like a movie and he can play him.
Yeah,</v>

696
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:32.840
I'm telling,
Hey,
I'm Tony Shay then.
No shame.
Hi,
I'm Tony Mendez.

697
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.840
<v 2>Fucking hilarious.</v>

698
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.680
And then when you saw the real Tony Mendez and he looked like Freddy fender,

699
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.630
that was one of the funniest.
No,
I mean,
I liked,
I liked Argo.
Argo was great,

700
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.330
but the end of that movie,
no shade,
been athletic,

701
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:51.410
but the whole Dahl movies going,
I'm Tony Mendez,
are you?

702
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.680
If anything would give that guy away would be his last fucking name.
Listen man,

703
00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.330
you need to go get more of a 10 a fucking mustache looked at each other when we

704
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.950
said,
when he said that,
like wonders.
No,

705
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.110
I was actually sitting there and the movie go,
wait a minute,
is that Italian?

706
00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:14.390
Maybe he's Mondays.
Mondays.
Hey,
no.
And I'm like,
no,
I done.

707
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:20.600
I go,
hey,
before that makes it Italian.
Um Oh.
Then the end,

708
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.790
when they sh everybody looked like the person,

709
00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:25.640
but then when they showed Ben Affleck and then they cut the Tony Mendez,

710
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.690
it was this fucking guy.
It was really far away.

711
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.910
It was profile and it was completely shadow.
Yeah.
Everybody else was a close up.

712
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:35.751
It was this,

713
00:42:35.751 --> 00:42:39.650
it was a full body shot with another white guy in there that he was shaking

714
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:42.800
hands with it.
You're like,
well,
maybe bends playing in the white guy.
Oh my God.

715
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.310
He's Tony Mendez.
What right there.
Just shows you what an incredible actor he is.

716
00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.270
Um,
he played Tony Mendez.
Alright.
Hi Bill.

717
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:51.860
That was a refugee when I was in Turkey.

718
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.610
I escape from a prison sentence for my political activities in the university

719
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.360
and I ran since I was a kid.
I always loved comedy.

720
00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.630
Is this fucking great?
This is why I love,
I love this shit.
Look at this,
this,

721
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.930
this,
this,
this is Billy red face coming out.
Iran.

722
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:12.250
There were only two funny magazines and I ran and I had all their issues since

723
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:16.440
the beginning.
Yeah.
This is how lucky we are.
Well,
okay.
Yeah.

724
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:21.020
They had mad magazine.
I ran in national Lampoon's.

725
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.940
Don't make fun of the ayatollah.
Um,

726
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.670
I didn't know standup comedy existed until I was 25.

727
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.870
Unreal being funny.
It wasn't a good thing.
Uh,

728
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.640
in Turkey I had 30 months.

729
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:39.410
I guess he had a sentence and I watched everything from prior and Cosby and

730
00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:41.960
Carlin to Hicks to Chapelle.

731
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.770
He was in prison and was able to get to the Internet to watch all these like,
ah,

732
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.380
I don't,
yeah,
I guess so.

733
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.950
What do people make hang gliders in prison or the dental floss and bed sheets.

734
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:56.330
They can't get the fucking Internet,
uh,
prison.
So No,

735
00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.000
you can't get the Internet listen,

736
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:03.330
which I was actually watching in Iran and I saw you there,
uh,

737
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.070
the first time as well as a detective.

738
00:44:07.071 --> 00:44:11.340
She puts her tits in my hand.
God,
that was funny.
Louis C,
k,
Patrice,

739
00:44:11.341 --> 00:44:15.050
Sam Kennison and you and everything in between.
I have listened to you guys.

740
00:44:15.051 --> 00:44:16.490
This is fucking great.
If this is true,

741
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:20.530
I have listened to you guys just talking about comedians on radios or podcasts

742
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.373
and I looked them up.

743
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:25.490
I saw every episode of tough crowd out of all the Comedians I've seen,

744
00:44:25.491 --> 00:44:30.440
you're in my top five.
Ah,
look at this.
You prior Cosby.

745
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:35.220
Louis Ck is partial.
The gingers and Dave Chapelle.
That's what he likes.

746
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:40.100
He likes black guys and judges.
I liked this guy.
I started and Jesus,

747
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.430
we'll try to keep it on this side of the road.
Okay.
I started writing and Turkey,

748
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.080
uh,
my friend told me my trend Fran told me to.
I did and it was well received.

749
00:44:49.081 --> 00:44:52.020
I started writing in English and I'm building courage to reform.

750
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.390
This is fucking great.
Uh,

751
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:57.480
I just want to tell you how much I appreciate those nights when I was sitting

752
00:44:57.481 --> 00:45:02.040
alone in Turkey and I didn't speak its language and I would watch one of your

753
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:04.290
standups and forget everything and laugh and laugh.

754
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:09.090
I found out today that that you are in Toronto.
I've been here four months now.

755
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.730
I'll try to find tickets.
How did I miss this email?

756
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.450
If the show hasn't finished yet,
I will see you live,
sir.
I promise.

757
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:19.260
Thanks again bill and say hi to your near.
That's great.
Well I'm going to tour.

758
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:23.430
Yeah,
I'm going to tour a Canada
in March.

759
00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:24.570
I'll come through all of these.

760
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.840
What if this is all just a big scam to get him to somehow,

761
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:32.730
I don't know.
Throw a pie in my face and do something to me.

762
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:34.860
Come up with that water that squirts in your face.

763
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:38.480
Where in Canada are you going in March?
Um,

764
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.620
I dunno.
I'm going to go to all the hockey cities and I'll,

765
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:45.600
maybe I'll add a couple others.
Yeah.

766
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:49.270
Why don't you just get down to it where you want to go cause you think you

767
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.420
exactly and you think I don't know what you're doing.

768
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.670
That's why you see what just happened there.

769
00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.970
This is like two fighters that know each other at this point.

770
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.800
I know what you do and you know what I do.

771
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.260
The second you said the second you said,
why are you going to Canada?
I'm like,

772
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:07.680
well
where are you going to Canada?

773
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:12.120
I knew misinterpret everything as some sort of like he's doing right now.

774
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:17.121
She's filibustering filibustering you know the old kick in the balls and that's

775
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:22.810
not what this is as asking where you're going in Canada.
If you are going,

776
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:26.640
why are you smiling at me?

777
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.390
I would want to go to that but I was going to get to it.

778
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:38.280
You're done.
See you just let it lay it on the ropes.
All right,

779
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.740
so the second you said,
when are you going to Canada?

780
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:45.690
I knew were in a where you go in and Canada.
I knew,
I'm like she loves Montreal.

781
00:46:45.691 --> 00:46:46.524
She wants to go.

782
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.030
So what I did to slip that punch is I said I'm going to all the hockey cities

783
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.030
cause I know you don't watch sports.
So then you got to be,

784
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.210
so then you had to show your hand.
I called your bluff and you're like,

785
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.220
ah yeah there you go to Montreal.
If you know that,

786
00:47:02.221 --> 00:47:07.050
then just say,
oh I'm I,
I'm am going to Montreal or I am not,
you're doing this.

787
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:11.060
I Dunno cause he cause it cause it cause it's,
what am I,

788
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:16.140
I'm going there to work unpacking my hard hat and my mic.
Stand hard.

789
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:18.390
Yeah.

790
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:22.260
You don't think it's worth to you of course I think is you don't respect me.

791
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.880
You don't respect what I do.
Just say no.
Jesus.
Oh,
you know what?

792
00:47:26.881 --> 00:47:30.040
Somebody sent a great fucking video this week.
Uh,

793
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:34.540
some God damn movie with this guy.
He just said,
this is some scene.

794
00:47:34.541 --> 00:47:39.400
He just says,
oh Jesus,
like 15 times in a row.
I got to show you this where it is,

795
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.470
where it is,
where it is,
what it is,
motherfucker.
All right,
here it is.

796
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.670
Listen to this guy.
Oh Jesus.

797
00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.530
Where is that from?
Dylan Moran.

798
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:05.670
Okay.
I got to tell you.
Yeah,

799
00:48:05.671 --> 00:48:08.820
and my agent's going to get an ear load of shit that I didn't read for that
part.

800
00:48:08.821 --> 00:48:13.740
I would have killed that.
Oh Gee,
thank you.

801
00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.790
That's great.
That's great though.
That's how fucking Gigi

802
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:25.550
he was good,
but he was doing something weird with this voice.
Alright.

803
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:29.790
Dui.
Uh Oh wait,
I got,
I got to read the other,
uh,

804
00:48:29.791 --> 00:48:33.870
the advertisers here.
All right.
Bear with me here.
Bear with me.
Bear with me.

805
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:38.700
Uh,
okay.
He voice.
All right everybody,

806
00:48:38.701 --> 00:48:41.280
if you're an entrepreneur and a customer calls,

807
00:48:41.281 --> 00:48:43.410
do you want to seem like you're in a high rise window view,

808
00:48:43.411 --> 00:48:47.130
fancy pants office or do you want them to know that you're just sitting there in

809
00:48:47.131 --> 00:48:49.740
your underwear?
Uh,
with the voice,

810
00:48:49.741 --> 00:48:53.340
you can create the appearance of an entire building.
Sales,
customer support,

811
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.010
tech support,
you name it.
They'll think you got it.

812
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.530
Give your customers the royal treatment with he voice.

813
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.540
He voice will forward your business calls.

814
00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:05.160
Do your home mobile or any number you choose.
Whenever,
wherever you are,

815
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.380
he voice will find you.
I know I always,

816
00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:10.980
my brain goes too far ahead in the sentence because you can't do two things at

817
00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:15.810
once,
which is what?
Reading and doing it out loud.
No,
I,
I can't,

818
00:49:15.811 --> 00:49:18.750
I can't do two things at once.
I can't multitask.

819
00:49:18.751 --> 00:49:23.490
Something suffers and neither can you.
Yes,
I can.
Are you done?
Like what?
No,

820
00:49:23.491 --> 00:49:25.800
I'm not.
Oh,
all right.
Well let's stop.
Heckling me.

821
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.640
Don't have time to take a call.

822
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:33.570
It's routed to your voicemail and you can read it at your convenience as an

823
00:49:33.571 --> 00:49:36.960
email.
A voice not only gives you the edge over your comp competitors,

824
00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.610
it takes the edge away from the big companies.
What they have over you right now.

825
00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:43.350
That's the biggest point right there.
Okay.

826
00:49:43.351 --> 00:49:45.240
You get to act like a big shot and now you can try it.

827
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.040
He voice for free for 30 days.

828
00:49:47.041 --> 00:49:51.660
Go to [inaudible] dot com or go just go to the podcast page at [inaudible] dot

829
00:49:51.661 --> 00:49:56.560
com and click on the voice banner.
All right,
last but certainly not least,

830
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.440
uh,
legal zoom.
You know,

831
00:49:58.441 --> 00:50:01.380
a lot of pride comes along with starting your dream business.

832
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.470
But think about the stress you'll feel if you don't take the right steps to

833
00:50:04.471 --> 00:50:08.580
legally protect your business and personal assets from the beginning.
Why?

834
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.500
Because people are sue happy.
So you know what?

835
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:15.390

Promo code birth.
All right.
That wasn't bad.
Only screwed it up once.
Um,

848
00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.210
I know I'm the worst story.
Dui.

849
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.540
Hey bill a Billy,
um,

850
00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.050
want to start out by saying when he loved stand up.
All right.

851
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.570
I'm 23 year old guy from Houston and on September 22nd,

852
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.280
I was arrested for the first time for a Dwi.
It's funny,

853
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:26.540
his Dui driving under influence driving while intoxicated in the thing.

854
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:31.070
All right.
It is,
it's just,
it's called a d.
We do dude.

855
00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:34.070
He got a fucking day.
Wait.
Um,

856
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:38.880
I took my eyes off the road and rear ended two vehicles at a stoplight.
Oops.

857
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:40.220
Chayse it,
he split the difference.

858
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:44.150
We'll either he hit one and it smashed into the other or they were both side by

859
00:51:44.151 --> 00:51:47.510
side.
Maybe he was so drunk he thought he could fit between the two of us.

860
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.650
He said no one was seriously injured,

861
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:55.250
but the rec brought an ambulance and several squad cars to the scene.

862
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.390
They arrested me and I blew.
So needless to say,
I'm in a pickle.

863
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.920
The lawyer I have,
however,
is good friends with the judge and the court.

864
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:08.510
He asked for the state's evidence against me and there's a chance we can beat
it.

865
00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:09.350
In the meantime,

866
00:52:09.351 --> 00:52:14.351
the court has me blowing into a breath alcohol device deal type of thing with

867
00:52:14.421 --> 00:52:18.830
the,
with cameras to ensure I'm not drinking and also a piss test.

868
00:52:18.831 --> 00:52:23.150
Every court date,
uh,
this is fine with me because jail sucked.

869
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:26.810
Court sucks.
And cops in the government workers are extremely rude.

870
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.620
Edge Jesus to was driving drunk.
Yeah,

871
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.920
somebody and their la La la.
Let's see what he says.

872
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.880
Because of all of this and being out on bond,

873
00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:40.370
I'm having to keep my nose extra clean,

874
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:43.130
have to lay really low and just exist.

875
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.910
It's a bummer and also hard not to think about drinking.
Also,

876
00:52:46.911 --> 00:52:51.110
I got to move out of my folk's house by November 1st they're not kicking me out

877
00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:53.090
or anything.
They're being very supportive.

878
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:56.030
It's just a date I set for myself before any of this happened.

879
00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:59.510
The fees and the lawyers are going to give me some financial woes and it will be

880
00:52:59.511 --> 00:53:04.250
tough.
Any advice you can give me a will be much appreciated.
Thanks bill.

881
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:09.050
Well,
I mean,
you should be happy you didn't fucking kill somebody and you know,

882
00:53:09.051 --> 00:53:11.600
if you weren't driving under the influence,

883
00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:13.910
she wouldn't have to run into all these root government workers.

884
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:17.410
So I would advice that you're looking for here.

885
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.230
You want somehow like hang in there buddy.
Yeah.
Um,
I,

886
00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.580
I would not have your Goddamn parent's house and lose.
Sorry.

887
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:31.140
I got no sympathy.
All right.
Nia,
Nia,
bringing the hammer down.
Uh,

888
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.320
jail sucks.
Oh,
does it?

889
00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.430
All right.
Well,
it's hard for me to come down on this guy because,
uh,

890
00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:45.150
all the Shit I've done and I've also,
you know,
fucking,
you know,

891
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:48.990
I got arrested of that shit a long time ago.
I just,
you know what I did?

892
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:51.030
I took my medicine and you know what?

893
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.610
I remember when I went in and I was finally getting my license back.

894
00:53:53.611 --> 00:53:57.030
The state trooper went to hand it to me and right as I went to gravity,

895
00:53:57.031 --> 00:53:58.800
pulls it back really quick.
He goes,
wait a minute,

896
00:53:58.801 --> 00:54:03.570
was it 90 days or 45 I only got 45 that's how long ago it was.
And I was like,

897
00:54:03.571 --> 00:54:06.150
who's 45 and then he handed it back to me.

898
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:10.200
He gave me that last little heart attack thing and I was thinking when I was

899
00:54:10.201 --> 00:54:14.070
younger he was a dick.
He was actually doing me a favor,
let me know like,

900
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.940
you know,
this is how simple it is.
And um,

901
00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:22.230
and it was,
and it was an absolute nightmare even at that,

902
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:26.430
just having my toe dipped into the legal system.

903
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.060
Did they put you in a,
like a holding cell or whatever you got arrested?

904
00:54:30.061 --> 00:54:33.720
How long you in there for?
I don't remember.
I was just like,
they could lay down.

905
00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:38.020
Where there other people in there?
No.
Oh God,
no,
no.

906
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.840
I was fortunate you got arrested in a small town,
but I mean if I buy a,

907
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.570
have you got arrested like in Boston?
Boston?
Yeah,
I would've gone.
I,

908
00:54:44.571 --> 00:54:46.650
they probably would have put me in county and that would've sucked.

909
00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.031
That would have sucked.

910
00:54:48.031 --> 00:54:50.640
Cause then you're in there with everybody that's getting a rain for everything

911
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:55.530
from eating somebody's head to me drinking and driving and he's thinking if I

912
00:54:55.531 --> 00:54:59.490
look like Ron Howard now I look like Ron Howard,
the director now.

913
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.590
But back then I look like Ron Howard living at home with Mr and Mrs. Cunningham.

914
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.740
So that would have been a,

915
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:12.330
you are opie when you were little then you Richie,
Richie now Ron Howard.

916
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:15.960
Oscar winning director.
Yeah.
That's a cruel joke.

917
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:20.190
Speaking of which we got to see Sandy's movie.
Sandy.

918
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.870
Sandra Bullock.
Yeah.
Okay.
Sandy.
I lives next door.

919
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:30.480
No,
that one looks good.
And so does the,
uh,
the Ron Howard one,
um,
was I gonna say,

920
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.810
uh,
yeah.
So do you know what you did it and um,

921
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.890
look,
it was actually a great thing when I get,

922
00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:40.770
when I got arrested and I had to go through drunk school and all that,

923
00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:43.830
and the mothers against drunk drinking and driving and all this information and

924
00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:47.480
all this stuff that they show you.
And I had to do community service.
I,

925
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:50.280
they did it at this hospital and I was wheeling all these people down to

926
00:55:50.281 --> 00:55:55.080
physical therapy and uh,
some were born that way.
One got hit by a drunk driver.

927
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.920
So I mean it definitely,
uh,
it hit home and I was a knucklehead,

928
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:04.970
like this guy kind of feeling sorry for myself rather than thinking about what

929
00:56:05.731 --> 00:56:09.510
could have happened and how dude,
listen,
this is my thing.
You got off easy,

930
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.810
you really got off easy and uh,

931
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:17.130
having to stay sober is actually a great fucking thing.
It's a great thing.

932
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.560
And um,
to kind of,
you know,

933
00:56:19.561 --> 00:56:24.400
take your foot off the gas pedal there and kind of regroup as far as like when

934
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:27.010
you can move out.
It all depends on what this whole thing's going to cost you.

935
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:31.810
But uh,
this all happened because of your actions and you are guilty.

936
00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.060
You blew in the thing and you were drunk,

937
00:56:34.061 --> 00:56:37.180
so you got to take your fucking medicine.
When are you going to do so I would,

938
00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:39.370
I would just take it on the chin,
be a fucking man.

939
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.620
And if that makes you have to move out December 1st or January 1st then that's

940
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:48.830
what you have to do.
And uh,
it's a great way to,

941
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.610
cause it seems to me like you like to party quite a bit,

942
00:56:51.611 --> 00:56:54.820
that just staying sober for a few days.
If it's bugging you like that,

943
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:56.110
that should kind of tell you something.

944
00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.970
Kind of like me with the cigars now you know where I all of a sudden want one

945
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:05.770
every night.
What did he say about having in judge lawyer?

946
00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:06.440
What did he say?

947
00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.910
That he could possibly get out of it and you could fight it and get out of it.

948
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:13.600
So he's got all these people sort of cushioning him along the way.
Like,

949
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:17.050
oh my parents aren't kicking me out of there being very supportive and he's got

950
00:57:17.051 --> 00:57:19.420
this person that could possibly get him out because they have an animal.

951
00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.460
So everybody's being nice to you,

952
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:23.680
which is why you then look at the government going,

953
00:57:23.681 --> 00:57:26.950
these guys are being rude to me and he's a kid.
All right,
these guys,

954
00:57:26.951 --> 00:57:30.880
they spoiled Brat is what he is.
Hey,
well look,
nobody,

955
00:57:30.881 --> 00:57:33.700
nobody can hear your point when you come at somebody like that.

956
00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:37.280
I ain't got no fucking Santa you fucking piece of shit like no one here.
That's,

957
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.660
that's how that's political debate in this country right now.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

958
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:44.020
Should I be wrapping my arms around him like everybody else in his life and

959
00:57:44.021 --> 00:57:47.260
telling him die.
Wrap my arms around them.
Okay,
we'll figure it out.

960
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.240
You don't have to move out just yet.
Don't worry.

961
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:52.570
We got it in and with this judge.
All right.
That's a decent point.

962
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:54.960
But was I wrapping my arms around him?
Yeah,

963
00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:57.550
but you're coming at me saying nobody hears you when you come at,

964
00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.570
you know like that.

965
00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:02.440
Like I'm somehow later on the podcast and you don't have your up.

966
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:03.520
You not all defensive.

967
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:06.670
Maybe you can hear what it is that I'm trying to say to you.
Wow.

968
00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.220
That's called maturity.
All right.

969
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:18.670
Oh,
I won that one.
It was just a battle.
It wasn't a war.

970
00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:22.690
It wasn't a war.
You're look at extra cute today,
by the way.
Right?

971
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:27.160
You don't even try it.
I'm not.
I'm just saying.
You get a nice smile.

972
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.610
All right,
you guys,
you guys are with,
this is my a game by the way.
Uh,

973
00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:37.810
and vice for an atheist in love with Christian fundamentalists.

974
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.390
Oh,
I love it.
Um,

975
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:45.300
as an atheist dating a Christian fundamentalist,

976
00:58:45.301 --> 00:58:48.850
Jesus Christ,
you thought opposites attract over here.
Nini,
uh,

977
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:53.020
complete with the purity ring and anal retentive.
Folks,

978
00:58:53.021 --> 00:58:55.750
how funny is it to have purity,
ring and anal for that quick?

979
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.530
I cannot say it initially.
I cannot say it initially seem promising.

980
00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:07.660
Even can even considered living,
uh,
leaving the worst.

981
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.200
I'm the worst.
I know,
but you know what?
This does,
this gives,

982
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.210
but this gives my listeners hope.
I really hope everybody listens.

983
00:59:16.211 --> 00:59:21.211
Who just thinks if this fucking moron can play the Chicago theater,

984
00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:23.880
I can't fucking do it too.
Um,

985
00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:29.010
as I throw each one of you a kiss,

986
00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:31.860
and it's funny when I was trying to send you that song and I said,

987
00:59:31.861 --> 00:59:34.560
as I blow each one of you,
I was gonna say,
blow each one of you a kiss.

988
00:59:34.561 --> 00:59:38.430
And he pauses as I blow each one of you.
When you looked at me like,

989
00:59:38.431 --> 00:59:39.720
what the fuck are you singing?

990
00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:46.170
This is my kind of email.
All right.
Um,
but this,

991
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:50.790
this girl is really,
she's really something else.

992
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:52.423
Uh,
you know,

993
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:57.300
this is probably the sexist in me that I initially thought that it was a guy

994
00:59:57.301 --> 01:00:01.560
with the purity ring and I as a Christian fundamentalist with the purity ring as

995
01:00:01.561 --> 01:00:06.270
a guy,
for some reason,
I think that that's creepier than a woman.
Actually.

996
01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:11.210
She has a purity ring.
Like I think that that's not as creepy.
She has.

997
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:15.330
Why?
Because as a guy,
he,
you know,

998
01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.290
when you fall in love with a woman,
you want one that's been just on the least.

999
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.460
And that's really what it comes down to.

1000
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.020
I don't want somebody else's fuck sweat on a checks chest cavity,
eh,

1001
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:33.120
eh,
eh,
Whoa,
whoa.
You know,
I'm just not,
yeah,

1002
01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.400
we're very visual animals.
Okay.

1003
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.210
There goes the EA game right out the fucking window.
All right?

1004
01:00:42.211 --> 01:00:46.080
But this girl is really something else short of sex.
She pushes boundaries.

1005
01:00:46.081 --> 01:00:49.230
She demands that she pay for half of our dates,

1006
01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:54.510
works her ass off to,
and a year of knowing her,
she has never freaked out.

1007
01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.130
And the crazy thing,

1008
01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:01.590
I can basically go mia for two weeks and it's like nothing happened.

1009
01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:06.050
Everything just continues because she's banging somebody else.

1010
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.100
I am actually thinking long term at this point,
not marriage.
I'm 21,

1011
01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:13.710
God dammit.
And I wonder if this is,
if it's,

1012
01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:19.250
if this is worth dealing with the drawbacks of religious pressure pressure's and

1013
01:01:19.621 --> 01:01:21.210
no sex for me,

1014
01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:24.960
the latter is a pain because I actually cannot masturbate,

1015
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.600
just doesn't do it for me,
which was,

1016
01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.700
so what are you doing during those two weeks when you disappear?

1017
01:01:29.701 --> 01:01:32.690
You're going to fucking,
he's going to fuck town there.
Uh,

1018
01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:36.180
I cannot promise I will take your advice,
but I will give it some weight.

1019
01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:40.740
Well then go fuck yourself.
Go.
Fuck.
I'm gonna sit there wasting my time.

1020
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:44.890
Can we read the next question?
Moving on.
Um,

1021
01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.120
from a lady,
um,

1022
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.500
dear Billy fuckface wow.
Ah,
that's funny.

1023
01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.680
The gate a longtime listener and fan and incidentally a woman.

1024
01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.040
So go figure that shit up.
Anyways,
I could use some advice.

1025
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.480
I'm getting married this November.
Yes.
I signed up to give away half of my shit.

1026
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.430
And this is well only if you're making more than he is.
Um,
other than that,

1027
01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:18.960
you signed up for a nice living room set.
Maybe a four bedroom colonial.

1028
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.660
My husband's such a jerk.
Oh my God.
At the sprinklers going off again.

1029
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.560
Um,
and this is bringing up a lot of family drama.

1030
01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.710
My paternal grandmother hates my mother.

1031
01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:37.390
My grandmother never felt like my mother was good enough for my father.
Oh,
Jesus.

1032
01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.780
And My mother.
Oh,
as my mother and I am very close.

1033
01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.610
My grandmother has hated me since birth and has always told me how ugly and

1034
01:02:45.611 --> 01:02:48.960
stupid I am.
What is this precious?

1035
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:55.440
Um,
needless to say,

1036
01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:56.903
oh,

1037
01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:01.370
I do not speak with her and haven't done so in years after she made some racist

1038
01:03:01.371 --> 01:03:04.910
comments regarding my future husband as he is Mexican,

1039
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:10.450
the problem comes in when my dad insists that she comes to the wedding,

1040
01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.890
I have no problem telling my dad to go fuck off.
I do not trust him.

1041
01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:19.180
And we do not get along.
Uh,
this screams a lope.

1042
01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:23.120
She should be asking me these question.
Um,
my mother and I,

1043
01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:29.140
my mother and I are very close and he is using that against me.

1044
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:34.370
I'm saying,
if I don't invite his mother,

1045
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.590
he will make my mother suffer.

1046
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:41.510
So do I invite this cunt grandmother to potentially be a racist bigot at my

1047
01:03:41.511 --> 01:03:46.340
wedding?
Or I tell my dad to fuck off but hurt my mom and the long run.

1048
01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.520
Um,
I would just elope.
Yup.

1049
01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.980
And I would have a party in your backyard.
Yup.
That's what I would do.

1050
01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.080
Just go and do it and then come back and be like,
yeah,
we got married and yeah,

1051
01:03:59.220 --> 01:03:59.780
the party.

1052
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.980
Because I think there's so much resentment and anger and that family and so much

1053
01:04:03.981 --> 01:04:08.450
lashing out that I think that they need a clean start,
a clean slate.

1054
01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.500
Just go out and tell the person that you're going to be with.

1055
01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:14.360
But what about his side of the family?

1056
01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:18.680
If they love her and then they want to be there.
I know,
but it's like,

1057
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:21.320
it's bigger than that though.
You know?
It's right.

1058
01:04:21.321 --> 01:04:24.640
So it's gotta be the two of them and then afterwards they have a big party and

1059
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:28.850
that's the thing.
I mean know always gonna be there.
Oh,
Tony Mendez.

1060
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:34.100
Ben Affleck is Tony's,
Tony Mendez,
city hall or whatever,

1061
01:04:34.101 --> 01:04:36.110
and just do it that way.

1062
01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.030
And then you have a big party later on or something like that.
But um,

1063
01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.090
I mean even if they have a party,
there's still,

1064
01:04:44.091 --> 01:04:46.070
maybe it's going to be these issues.

1065
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.700
Did she say that her dad is married to her mom or they're divorced?

1066
01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:55.040
Sounds like they're divorced.
He's going to make life a living hell for the mom.

1067
01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:58.340
And how would he do that?
Exactly?
Well,
maybe.
Yeah,
maybe.
Yeah.

1068
01:04:58.341 --> 01:05:02.510
I mean who does that to somebody they love build of asshole.
Your Dad is,

1069
01:05:02.511 --> 01:05:05.970
I'm sorry about that.
That really,
you know,
it's,

1070
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:07.640
it's human beings.

1071
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:14.510
I don't understand how you just say,
hey,
say lovey.
I mean,

1072
01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:18.340
isn't the point of your stupid podcasts and have an opinion about every goddamn

1073
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:22.780
little thing.
Just want to wave your hand in the air and be like,
human beings.

1074
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:27.160
That's life.
Who are you?
Where did you go?

1075
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.280
Because you know why fucking drive.

1076
01:05:29.281 --> 01:05:33.730
And I'm texting while driving to go down and get the juice today.

1077
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:36.220
Fucking five minutes later I got the juice,

1078
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:38.870
some drive and some fucking asshole in front of me is gone and slow speed and

1079
01:05:38.871 --> 01:05:39.910
I've gone slow speeding up.
I go,

1080
01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.150
but this fucking assholes texting and then I look at him and I'm like fucking

1081
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:47.410
idiots texting blah blah.
And I was just doing it.
Yeah.
So you're a hypocrite.

1082
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:51.190
Yeah.
Right?
But that doesn't mean you can have an opinion.
But am I unique?

1083
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:55.840
Am I am I am I am I unique cause I'm weak.

1084
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.470
You're not weak.
You just know you're not weak.

1085
01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:05.650
You just have no patience.
All right?
You can't wait.

1086
01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:07.530
So your stop somewhere to do what you gotta do.

1087
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.010
Christ it didn't I just say how good you looked like you coming at me like this,

1088
01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.140
they not know and I understand what this is.

1089
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:15.760
You love me and you're worried I'm going to get hurt.

1090
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:17.770
So that's coming out this way right now.
Okay.

1091
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:21.190
I promise I will try and stop texting.
I'll try and stop yelling.

1092
01:06:21.191 --> 01:06:23.740
I'll try and stop being a piece of shit.
I'll try to stop fucking,

1093
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.090
I wonder these days in the year I'm going to be that guy.

1094
01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:32.110
I'll be that fucking guy.
I want you to be anybody but yourself,

1095
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.800
but well then you know what?
You know what?
Yeah.

1096
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:42.060
The thing is is you think that like if I scrape way all this shit,

1097
01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:44.090
what do you think is under these cysts?

1098
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:47.410
The guy drinks the Dole second with the cougar in his kitchen.

1099
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.480
That's not who's going to be,
I'm going to go back.

1100
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:51.880
I'm going to go with the most interesting man in the world.

1101
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:57.190
I'm just going to end up being fucking eight year old Billy.

1102
01:06:57.910 --> 01:07:02.410
Oh boy.
You won't go to the movies tonight.
I like with that.
Why?

1103
01:07:02.411 --> 01:07:07.360
I like that Billy.
Now you don't,
what do you mean?
Cause this is the deal.

1104
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.610
When I am actually,

1105
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:16.210
when I am on the rare times when I am in a chilled out mood and I am going with

1106
01:07:19.091 --> 01:07:22.180
the flow and whatever you want to do,
I'm like,
yeah,

1107
01:07:22.181 --> 01:07:24.430
let's do it and I don't question it or anything.

1108
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:29.620
You get a concerned look on your face and you like,
are you okay?
Are you okay?

1109
01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.440
And then I say what?
I'm,
I'm,

1110
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:37.120
I'm being the guy you want me to be right now of me.
That's about it.
That's,

1111
01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:41.000
that's how rare it is for you to be that person that has nothing.
No,

1112
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.700
but then I understand that part.
But then you also said to me one time like,
well,

1113
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:48.220
I don't want you to,
then you get like concerned.

1114
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:52.690
I don't want you to be somebody you're not.
Right.
So when there's,

1115
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.350
so when you see chilled out me,
it,

1116
01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.520
it like you almost talked me out of it and I get it too because the seat shelled

1117
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:05.140
out me is such a fucking shock to you that you want to make,

1118
01:08:05.141 --> 01:08:06.490
you want to go fucking,

1119

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.480
But right there near,
it's just like,
are you okay?

1123
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:26.690
It doesn't mean you make it feel like I'm fucking weird cause I'm chilled out

1124
01:08:26.691 --> 01:08:28.210
and then,
and then you go all in,

1125
01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.990
you fucking turn it all the way to the other side.

1126
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:34.100
It doesn't mean I know to appreciate it.
Is Everything okay?
But I like it.

1127
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.420
What's wrong with you?
You're all over the double line.
Pick a fucking lane.

1128

Who are we playing that team from?
'Em Up there.

1144

They want a few times.
Just,

Pick,

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.970

You know the,
uh,
the,
the bears,

1146
01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:54.110
the bears.
That's not bad.
I don't know.
We're not,
we're not playing that division.

1147
01:09:54.111 --> 01:09:54.690
Let me,
let's see.

1148
01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:59.420
I'm on a schedule and stats schedule,

1149
01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.340
season schedule,
Bang.
What do we got here?
Oh,

1150
01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:07.750
next week we're playing the Bengals.
Who I heard are under achieving.

1151
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:11.930
That's what I read on the thing.
All right,
well we shall see,
right?
Huh?

1152
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:15.200
Bangled tag Bengal tigers,
which are native to India,

1153
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:20.150
which is in Asia,
which is part of

1154
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.263
<v 3>Asia,</v>

1155
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.380
<v 1>which is part of the world.
What are you talking to me?</v>

1156
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.830
Which is a tiny.in

1157
01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:31.040
<v 3>the universe.</v>

1158
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:41.110
<v 1>You kept going?
Yeah.
You're like India,
Asia,</v>

1159
01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:46.240
the world,
the universe.
Yay.
All right.

1160
01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.760
This is what the Patriots have come up.
These are our next three games,

1161
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:52.950
the bangles,
which I think that's a dangerous game.
All right?

1162
01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:57.590
There are a wounded animal.
Those bangles,
nanny,
they're backed into a corner.
Uh,

1163
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.390
the saints is going to be a rough one.
And the jets that's at the jets,
it's,

1164
01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:04.960
I know they supposed to,
supposed to stink this week,
this,
this week.

1165
01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:06.910
This year they're supposed to stink,
but we already beat him.

1166
01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.990
And it's a division rivalry.
And uh,
they always play as tough.
We had a,

1167
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:14.700
was it 13 to 10?
Says right here.
I'm 2121.

1168
01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.080
<v 2>When we played the bills,
those division rivalry games,
I like taking the under.</v>

1169
01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:23.090
Um,
so anyways,
I don't even know what the Monday night game is this week,
but,
uh,

1170
01:11:23.091 --> 01:11:26.190
I'm gonna try to get caught up on the football and uh,

1171
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.980
I'll tell you the Broncos and Seahawks Neenee,

1172
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.790
I think they're on a collision course.
What do you say?
Sure.
Absolutely.
So a few.

1173
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.170
If a,
if a bronco collide in a seat,
in a Seahawk,

1174
01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:40.390
whatever the fuck that is.
I think that it's a sin.

1175
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.350
It's a seagull on roids it's a bird cause I,
yeah,

1176
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:46.260
but when you look up to see hockey,
can't find it other than the team.

1177
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:50.240
I just remember being like an eighth or seventh grade and um,

1178
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:54.540
the boys are where those starter jackets and I remember the Seattle Seahawks and

1179
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.300
it was like a bird face.
Isn't that there?
Yeah,
that's their logo.
The logo.
Sorry.

1180
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.860
Oh there it is.
Is that what the fuck it looks like.
You know why?
Cause they sit,

1181
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:02.970
they spell it one word

1182
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.970
but you just write see Hawk and then you just have the image.
Dude.

1183
01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:13.470
Is there anything like more evil looking than a bird of prey is saying they

1184
01:12:13.471 --> 01:12:16.350
never look like they're in a good mood.
Like poisonous snakes.

1185
01:12:16.351 --> 01:12:19.290
They always have like their right,
they're nonexistent.
Eyebrows are always down.

1186
01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:24.930
Okay,
there we go.
See that does,

1187
01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:28.150
I said hits of anger.
Yeah.
That's what it looked like on this day.
Or you don't.

1188
01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:32.290
If you were a bird,
that's the kind of bird you would be attracted to me.

1189
01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.740
I got to stop dating these birds of prey.
They're such an assholes.

1190
01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:39.730
You know it's funny cause I was thinking when you were describing like,
oh,

1191
01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:43.510
you'd like a vulture.
I was like,
you're like,
I was thinking that that was,

1192
01:12:43.511 --> 01:12:46.860
you know,
you'd like a vulture with that red heads.
You get me.

1193
01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:50.850
That's what I'd be picking at a caucus.
No,
you'd be like this.

1194
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.050
You'd be like a Seahawk looks.
I wasn't,
I wasn't,

1195
01:12:53.051 --> 01:12:56.090
I wasn't fishing for a compliment here.
I was just saying no,
no.
The,

1196
01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.540
these are the guys you dated before you got to me.

1197
01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.440
I'm not a bird of prey and I'm not a bird of prey knee.
I know how to make a pie.

1198
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:06.120
Yes you did.
Yes,
I did have a very,
you know what I'm like,
yes.
I'm a

1199
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.880
Billy the banker.
I'm a Blue Edison.

1200
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:16.390
I'm a dove pasty white.
Now you're a woodpecker.

1201
01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:19.870
Just cause I'm like,
go fuck yourself.

1202
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:23.080
That's actually the bat.
That's probably the best one.
All right,

1203
01:13:23.081 --> 01:13:25.480
so you got the last one in.
There you go.
Yay.
All right.

1204
01:13:25.481 --> 01:13:28.150
This week I'm going to be in El Paso.
This whole run.

1205
01:13:28.151 --> 01:13:32.530
I'm going to be with a rose bowl king Rosebowl tailgate legend Joe Bart.
Nick.

1206
01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.420
We're going to be an El Paso on Wednesday.

1207
01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.590
Then we're going to San Jose on Thursday,
and then I'm going to fucking Seattle.

1208
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.290
Um,
we'll see how loud they are in Seattle.
Then I'm gone on Friday,

1209
01:13:44.291 --> 01:13:48.850
and then I go to a Phoenix and a on Saturday,

1210
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.420
and that's it.
And that's,
that's,
that's,
that's,
that's fucking it.

1211
01:13:52.421 --> 01:13:54.430
That's what I'm going to be.
Right.
That's the podcast for this week.
