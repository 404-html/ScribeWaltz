1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:06.570
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,
January 22nd,

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.220
2018 what's going on?
How are you?
How are Ya?
How's it going?

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.850
How's it going?
All right.
All right.
Um,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.100
let's just get right down to it.

6
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.450
The New England patriots are going to the Superbowl again.

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:26.340
Super Bowl unfucking believable.
How many times can they win?

8
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.270
Games like that.
It's incredible.
I thought the officiating was great.

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.310
It was great.
Fantastic.
I liked how it all washed up.

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.780
I really enjoyed that referee laughing his ass off after we scored a touchdown.

11
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:47.640
That was tremendous.
I love everybody who saw that rough cracking up laughing.

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.600
Um,
which you are not supposed to do by the way as a referee.

13
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.280
And that guy will definitely get disciplined because what happens is,

14
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:57.420
is every mouth breathing more and goes fuck the capes fixed.

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.840
He's laughing cause they just,
you know,
like,

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.990
which I understand that is the knee jerk reaction.

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.130
But think about what you're saying.
All right.

18
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.410
Let's just say for the sake of argument that referee was,
was on the take.

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.580
All right.
Which you know,
God knows.
I always said that about the NBA.

20
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.810
And then they caught that fucking guy and everybody said I was nuts.
All right.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.660
Put yourself in that guy's position.
All right,
judge you by his age,
you probably,

22
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.710
I'm going to assume he had a wife and kids.
He's got a mortgage,

23
00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:34.150
she's got a house and he's risking all of that and his freedom

24
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.900
to fix an NFL game.
Put yourself in that position.

25
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.720
Are you going to be laughing when the team scores or are you going to be fucking

26
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.010
stone faced?
Are you really going to be sitting there going,
yeah,
good.

27
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.600
Just like we fucked.
It's sad.
You know?

28
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.340
So I'm hoping the NFL films will come out just to hear what,
what,

29
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.600
uh,

30
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.320
whatever patriots said that made him laugh because he's going to get in trouble

31
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:05.520
for that because that opened this floodgate.
Everybody was just saying like,
oh,

32
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.280
look at all the piddle teas or soil boo boo boo boo boo boo.

33
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.880
I still don't like to ticky tack pass in a fringe stuff.
Um,

34
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.950
however,
having said all of that,
uh,
you know,

35
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:20.280
I think the Jaguars defense was a little overrated.

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.240
Everybody kept talking about how fucking great their defense was and completely

37
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:30.780
ignored that the week before they gave up 42 fucking points to the Steelers in

38
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.680
the playoffs.

39
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.990
<v 0>When it counted,
everyone just kept talking about how great their fucking teeth,</v>

41
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:41.670
but that defense is that the only reason why nobody really fucking brought that

42
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:42.504
up

43
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.380
<v 1>okay.</v>

44
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.820
<v 0>Was because they fucking,</v>

45
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.480
they are often scored 45 points.

46
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.790
<v 0>So I dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

48
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.390
What the fuck did tell you about that?
Great Jaguar defense.

49
00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:01.650
He also played in a week division.
They beat the cults twice.

50
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.440
That's why I don't,
this is,
this is my deal.
Okay.

51
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:05.930
I'm not saying they don't have uh,
have,
uh,

52
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.640
they actually do have a great defense but they're young and they do dumb things

53
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:16.641
like take stupid penalties right before the half when the home team whose

54
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:18.960
favorite is only scored three points,

55
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:22.260
that fucking helmet to helmet hit by the way.

56
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.140
Stupid fucking penalty.
Big Chunk at yards.

57
00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:30.030
And then you take a fucking bonehead pass interference call on the next play.

58
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

59
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.400
<v 0>And you basically give the Patriots a touchdown.
You give them fucking hope.</v>

60
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.480
And then also your great defense gives up two touchdowns in the final fucking

61
00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:42.090
six minutes.
So I don't know what to tell you.

62
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.190
There was a brutal hold call on the final,
uh,

63
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.690
important offensive player of the game.
I will give you that,
but okay,

64
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:52.200
let's say they call holding there.
We're going to run it the next play.

65
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.230
You guys are going to burn your last time out.
We're going to kick the ball.

66
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:58.230
You're going to be down on the 10 fucking yard line and you're telling me what

67
00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:02.220
the minute and Change Blake Bortles is going to run the length of the fuck.

68
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.830
I mean,
it could happen,
it could fucking happen,
but I dunno.

69
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.710
I Dunno.
But anyways,
that's why I don't give a shit about,
uh,

70
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.290
you know,
regular season stats,
you know,

71
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.760
I mean,
okay,
here's a,
here's a thing.

72
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.570
Pumping up the fucking Jag was defense regularly season.

73
00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:26.760
They'd beat the cults without Andrew Luck.
27 nothing.

74
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.690
They beat the browns.
And only gave up seven fucking points.

75
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.760
They'd beat the cults again,
30 to fucking 10 they beat the Texans.

76
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:38.290
45 to seven.

77
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.600
These are all fucking teams that you're not going to see in January.

78
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.330
All right.
But if you go through their fucking season,

79
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.910
they played the titans twice a playoff teams.
They lost to him both times,

80
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.590
let up 37 fucking points and had a close game at the end of the year.

81
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.840
They played the rams that were a playoff team.
They lost to them.
Yeah.

82
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.410
The only playoff team that I'm looking here real quick that they beat was the

83
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:09.450
Pittsburgh Steelers beat him 30 to nine and then they met him in the playoffs

84
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.550
and they let up 42 fucking points.
So

85
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.700
I don't know.
I mean,
how much more advantage could that defense have?
I mean,

86
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.280
Adelman wasn't in the game are number one receiver.

87
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:24.790
Our next number one option was rob ground Koski and you're knocked him out,

88
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.300
you know,
on a helmet to helmet hit that if a Patriot did,

89
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:32.530
it would have been viewed as like the like,
like you killed Christ or something.

90
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.240
MMM.
But whatever.
It was a great game.
Jaguars should have won the game.

91
00:05:38.241 --> 00:05:41.450
I just thought they were too young and didn't know how to win the game.

92
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.860
Didn't know how to put the Patriots away.
And um,

93
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.180
I dunno it Tom Brady's Tom Brady.
Not to mention Tom Brady also had like a,

94
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:54.400
I dunno what the fuck happened
guy cut his fucking hand.

95
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.880
<v 2>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 0>We have almost 41 old quarterback with the,</v>

97
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.890
with the fucking stitches in his throwing hand.

98
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.170
Annulment is out and you knock out Gronk Koski and I don't want to heal up

99
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:09.470
ground.
Koski wasn't doing shit ground.
Koski does something on every play.

100
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.710
He draws double coverage and you didn't have to fucking deal with that anymore.

101
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:14.860
So I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
Uh,

102
00:06:14.861 --> 00:06:17.270
I do feel bad for Jaguar fans because you know,

103
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.210
that's a fucking football city that nobody seems to give a shit about.

104
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.440
You know what I mean?
I liked the genetics.
You know what?

105
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:28.400
I've actually come around and those helmets too.
So it was a great fucking game.

106
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.590
The Patriots are limping into the Superbowl and should be underdogs,

107
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.550
but won't be cause every mouth breathing more on who doesn't know shit about

108
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:42.320
football.
We'll put money on the Patriots for somehow we will be,
I mean,

109
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:47.030
the eagles just look like fucking world beaters.
They have an amazing defense.

110
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.400
They have to fucking base.
They only have proles and fucking

111
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.650
Malcolm Blunt.
I mean,
I don't know why the fuck are,
we haven't got rid of him.
Um,

112
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.270
I'm sure there was a reason for it,
but,
uh,
yeah,

113
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.890
I mean the eagles should be favorites,

114
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.980
but they won't be just historically cause it never fucking want it.

115
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.150
And we've won a lot.
So,
um,
so then if we lose,

116
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.130
it's going to be like an unbelievable,
I'm flat.

117
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:17.630
What does it say about Brady legacy?
Um,
we shall see.

118
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.250
We shall see.
And I feel bad for,
um,

119
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.260
uh,

120
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.310
New England fans that are going to go to that game with the behavior of eagles

121
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:32.120
fans and all of that shit.
And,
uh,
you know,

122
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.480
I saw some of the footage,
some of this shit was funny,
but like,
I dunno,

123
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.840
Philly fans fancy,
you know what they act like.

124
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.120
Do you remember when you did know how to talk to women?

125
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:44.810
So you just fucking went out and did crazy shit every weekend hoping that the

126
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:46.700
women would then hear the story and be like,
oh,

127
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:48.290
that's the guy I want to go out with

128
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.620
and it's,
don't get it,
man.
I just don't,
you know,
fucking vikings fans.
Oh,
hey,

129
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.311
oh,
are you,
oh,

130
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:03.311
you're doing like the fucking Nice Midwest people you throwing full beers at

131
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:08.570
them.
I Dunno.
But on the other side it's just like,
you know,

132
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.120
that's what you're going to get.
Why the fuck would you wear your,

133
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:15.680
your vikings gear to the Goddamn game?
Um,

134
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.680
but that's really getting played out,
showing that type of shit.
And uh,

135
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.620
and they did the classic thing too.
You know,
it's funny with,

136
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:28.640
with every like NFL city,
they are,
they have like the story,

137
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.690
like whenever there's a game in Boston,

138
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:37.430
they have to play that stupid fucking departed music.
Um,

139
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:40.970
shipping up to Boston and I lost me leg and then they're going to show Paul

140
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:44.900
revere and all this freedom trail shit that nobody gives a fuck about.

141
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:47.900
Who Lives in Boston?
Why walked by that fucking statue a million times?

142
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:50.900
I never look at it.
Um,

143
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.470
and I don't eat clam chowder anytime Philly in a major sporting event,

144
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.460
at some point some fucking Douche is going to try to teach you how to order a

145
00:09:01.461 --> 00:09:02.630
Philly cheese steak.

146
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.980
It's like we got it gimme a Wiz.
Wait,

147
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.290
give me one word out.
Don't say Philly cheese steak.

148
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.670
You're in Philly.

149
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.340
You could literally walk up there to any fucking cheese steak place in

150
00:09:22.341 --> 00:09:23.510
Philadelphia and be like,

151
00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:28.511
I would like a cheese steak with onions and peppers and provolone cheese and

152
00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:32.420
you're going to get it because at the end of the day,

153
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.240
they're a fucking business and they need your money.

154
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.000
They always do that.

155
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:41.570
They show the fucking rocky statue and then they bring up the fact that they

156
00:09:41.571 --> 00:09:44.240
threw some fucking batteries.
It's Santa Claus.

157
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.760
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

158
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.760
<v 0>As if that is the only fucking thing that has ever happened in Philadelphia.</v>

159
00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:55.951
Why don't they ever reenact Ben Franklin supplying that fucking stupid kite with

160
00:09:56.501 --> 00:10:01.090
the key on it.
Right.
Why don't they bring up the 83?

161
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:05.590
Philadelphia 76 is the most underrated fucking championship team of all time.

162
00:10:05.591 --> 00:10:10.000
Who I've said forever that I would put up against the 96 balls.
Okay.

163
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.220
I would take doctor Jay and,
and fucking Andrew.
Tony

164
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.260
Two fucking knocked down a lot of what Jordan and fucking,
uh,

165
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.580
what's his face are going to do.
Scottie Pippin.

166
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.400
And then underneath you got fucking Moses Malone one on one against Luc Longley.

167
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.350
I'm not saying they would have one,
but I'm saying,
you know,

168
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.860
be a hell of a fucking series.
Anyways.
Congratulations to the,

169
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:49.210
uh,
to the fucking eagles.
What a game.
Good Lord.
They,
that was,

170
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:52.420
they gave them the,
they gave the vikings.
He,
oh,
right there,
Fred.
I,

171
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:53.620
but there was a lot of biking fan.

172
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.970
What should that they just fucking lost to the saints after that beat down.

173
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.470
It took them right across the fucking lap.
Spanked if fanny.
Um,

174
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.090
is it weird that,
I mean,
as much as I love the vikings,

175
00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:12.860
I kind of was rooting for the eagles just because,
uh,

176
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.403
I dunno.

177
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

178
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.060
<v 0>Case Keenan,
I just can't get past that name.
Case keen him.</v>

179
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:25.730
It just makes me still feel so fucking old.
Somebody named the kid case.

180
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.553
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

181
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.170
<v 0>good.
Just name Robert.</v>

182
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.230
Sorry,
I'm being a cunt.
Um,
so anyways,

183
00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:42.990
if you are a Patriot's fan,
um,
yeah,
just know that,
you know,
it's,

184
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.350
it's going to be a terrible fan experience,
uh,

185
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.700
because nobody does anything about that level of fucking ridiculous behavior.

186
00:11:51.701 --> 00:11:55.070
And I think at this point they get so much fucking hype out of how bad they

187
00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:57.470
behaved.
They like trying to outdo one another.

188
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.090
Like you remember a few years ago there was like some off duty cop went to like

189
00:12:02.091 --> 00:12:06.170
a Philly's game and this guy was swearing and shit behind him and he goes,
hey,

190
00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:06.591
take it easy.

191
00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:10.730
I got my kid here and the guy put his fingers down his throat and threw up on

192
00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:11.630
the guy's kid.

193
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.180
I mean at that point it's just like you just doing that just to do it right.

194
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.280
I Dunno.
So anyways,

195
00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:22.010
so now we're gonna have to sit through fucking too God damn weeks of them

196
00:12:22.011 --> 00:12:27.011
talking about fucking throwing batteries at Santa Claus and showing the fucking

197
00:12:27.051 --> 00:12:30.890
Paul Revere Statue and I'm shipping up to Boston and I lost me leg.

198
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.943
<v 1>MMM.</v>

199
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.340
<v 0>I Dunno.
I think the eagles are,</v>

200
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.540
<v 1>yeah,</v>

201
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.130
<v 0>an overwhelming favorite.</v>

202
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.100
If people knew what a gamble on football I would think,

203
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.120
but that's not how it works.
Um,

204
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.230
but I think it's definitely,
it's the eagles game to fucking lose.

205
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.960
Um,
I might be crazy,
but that's,
that's definitely what I think.
But,
uh,
all right,

206
00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:58.250
so there you go.
There's,
there's my,

207
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.400
there's my football talk condolences to the fucking Jaguars in Vikings fans.

208
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.083
<v 1>MMM.</v>

209
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:07.781
<v 0>Hey.</v>

210
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:12.010
You know what I'm actually excited to watch is that thing where they have a some

211
00:13:12.011 --> 00:13:15.820
Thursday on CBS about the NFL players.

212
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:19.210
Like who's like the most to like basically whatever your hobby is.

213
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.680
They got guys in the NFL playing drums,
guitar,
cooking and Shit.

214
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.920
I actually want to watch that cause I want to see how good the the football

215
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:31.000
player drummers or how stupid is that,
right?
Oh,
whatever.

216
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:34.000
He got a thousand fucking channels.
You've got to find something to watch.
Right?

217
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.230
Um,
anyways.

218
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.540
Did you guys see that fucking

219
00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.123
<v 1>okay?</v>

220
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.470
<v 0>The fuck is that,
that that one year anniversary,
I forgot.</v>

221
00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.400
Maybe that lady when Trump got in who was was just screaming.
No.

222
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.793
<v 1>Okay.</v>

223
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.450
<v 0>I don't understand that,
that type of protest</v>

224
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.530
to do something like that because I think a lot of people were thinking that,

225
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:01.630
but to literally do what that woman did,

226
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.920
it makes anybody who doesn't like Trump look like a fucking lunatic.

227
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.953
<v 1>Okay.</v>

228
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.020
<v 0>You know,
there's so much just weird shit like that.
Like I saw last night,</v>

229
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.950
the Sag awards had all women presenters.

230
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.100
I just fucking for the fucking life of me who comes up with this shit,

231
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.480
all of it just seems like self preservation to me and none of it seems like

232
00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:32.360
you're actually going to work on the problem.
Like,

233
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.540
that's all the sag awards have to fucking do is just have all female presenters

234
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.190
and be like,
yeah,
see that they're all good people over there.
They get it.

235
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.360
It's a show of solidarity as a show of strength.
I Dunno.

236
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.320
I think it's a pretty weak fucking effort.
You know,

237
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.430
we're going to wear all black Tuxedos.

238
00:14:51.431 --> 00:14:55.840
We're going to where we're going to have all female presenters.
There we go.

239
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.800
We've been vetted.

240
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

241
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.450
<v 0>I hate that word,
by the way.</v>

242
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.853
<v 1>MMM.</v>

243
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.420
<v 0>Yeah.
That's,
that's the whole fucking thing.
It's just a,</v>

244
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.070
I mean,
who,
who the fuck,
who is pro sexual harassment?

245
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.590
Why would you need to go that much out of your way to do something as silly as

246
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:23.150
that?
Which in a lot of ways is kind of reverse sexist,
isn't it?

247
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.920
I don't know.
Here's one fucking thing about this.

248
00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.560
This is the only business I know.
Bart,
is this business that I'm in.

249
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:30.340
This business is fucking brutal and a,

250
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.310
it routinely picks people up and slams him against the pavement emotionally,

251
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.200
every fucking day.
Regardless of what's between you,
between your legs.

252
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.043
<v 1>I Dunno.</v>

253
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.620
<v 0>All right.
I,
I don't,
uh,</v>

254
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.783
<v 1>okay.</v>

255
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.370
<v 0>I don't even know what I'm trying to say here.
I just look at it.
I'm like,
well,</v>

256
00:15:50.371 --> 00:15:52.940
if they just decided they were going to have all male presenters,

257
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:57.320
that would be considered the most sexist thing ever.
And a,

258
00:15:57.321 --> 00:16:00.200
and then on the other side,
if you want all this fucking,

259
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:02.690
all these creeps,

260
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:03.730
<v 1>okay,</v>

261
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.140
<v 0>well,
eyelids be specific.</v>

262
00:16:05.141 --> 00:16:09.010
Only the male creeps in Hollywood if you want all of them out.

263
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:11.050
I don't know that that's the fucking way to do it.

264
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.680
If that's an effective way to do it everywhere,
buddy.

265
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:18.130
Where's the same colored shirt?
And you have all women presenters.

266
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.630
You know,
I don't have,
I don't have a degree in fighting crime,

267
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:24.650
whatever that degree is.

268
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.813
<v 1>Uh,</v>

269
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.790
<v 0>but I don't think same colored shirts is going to do it.</v>

270
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.290
We have to stop Isis.
Okay.
Everybody wear blue shirts on Tuesday.

271
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

272
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.440
<v 0>He's not wearing a blue shirt.
Does that mean he's in Isis?</v>

273
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.253
<v 1>MMM,</v>

274
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.270
<v 0>it that what it is,
Bill.
It's as it's as it's symbolism.</v>

275
00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:54.040
It's a sign of strength though.
Jesus.
All right.
Maybe that is what it is.

276
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:57.910
I have no fucking idea.
Um,
this,
this,
why,
this is why I watch sports.

277
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.630
I watch fucking sports.
So once again,
the New England patriots,

278
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.430
they're in their 10th fucking Superbowl.
They have a chance to,

279
00:17:06.431 --> 00:17:10.750
when they're six super bowl,
literally what Tom Brady,
Bella check,

280
00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:14.950
and these guys are doing as much as you guys fucking hate him at every fucking

281
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.030
time.
We win a game,

282
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:19.900
the sub giant Goddamn conspiracy because nobody will give it up that there are

283
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:22.000
fucking great team.
Uh,

284
00:17:22.001 --> 00:17:25.660
what they've done at this point has transcended the game of football.

285
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.530
All right?
You gotta put them up there with like the fucking,

286
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.420
I would say the Yankees from Dimaggio to uh,

287
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.700
<v 1>yeah.</v>

288
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.480
<v 0>Mickey Mantle that run there with the amount of world series that they went to,</v>

289
00:17:39.481 --> 00:17:40.640
the amount that they want.
Yeah.

290
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:42.643
<v 1>MMM.</v>

291
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.560
<v 0>The Canadians back in the day,
the Celtics in the 60s.
I mean,</v>

292
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:54.180
that's literally what you're watching.
And for them to be doing it now,

293
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.651
you know,

294
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.310
the reason why that never happens anymore is because now there's like 30 fucking

295
00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:04.170
teams
and every,
uh,
basically every sport,
it's just too,

296
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:06.870
it's too difficult to do.
And somehow they are doing it.

297
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:08.190
So as much as you hate him,

298
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:10.710
can you at least give it up on that or are you just going to say,
I dunno,

299
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:15.750
we're going to start weighing football's again and fucking,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

300
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.220
Um,
all right.
Speaking of the Canadian,

301
00:18:19.221 --> 00:18:23.670
say you guys know up there in Montreal.
Ah,

302
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:26.580
you watch any Bruins Canadians Games lately?
We fucking,

303
00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.950
we beat him three times in the last eight days.

304
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.430
And the only reason why I know that is cause Joe Barton from the uh,

305
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.180
the great puck off podcast told me I've been so goddamn busy.
Um,

306
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.510
I only watched the first period of one of the Games.

307
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:41.190
I've missed so much Bruins hockey,

308
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:46.050
this and I know they're playing great and they're on this amazing streak and a

309
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.380
pretty excited that they'd beat the Canadians three times in the last eight

310
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:51.900
games.
I know I have all the games taped so I'm going to,

311
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:55.500
I'm going to have to watch them and like one period segments now cause uh,

312
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.470
cause I got the Kiddo at home.
But,
uh,

313
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.480
I haven't said that everybody knows the regular season doesn't mean shit.
Um,

314
00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.340
you know,
and Regulus I'm telling you,
regular season stats,

315
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.300
just go back to somebody's schedule and look at what they did against playoff

316
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:13.440
teams.
And even then,

317
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.540
I think in football it gives you a little bit more of a gauge.
But like,
uh,

318
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.780
in basketball,
baseball and hockey,
it,

319
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.580
I don't think it means shit because on any given night,

320
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.970
any they play so many games,
any team can beat another team.

321
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.860
But a winning in the playoffs and winning four out of seven is it's a whole

322
00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:39.570
different ball game.
So,
um,
I just wish more announcers would do that shit.

323
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.330
You know what I mean?
Look at the division,
like even the light.

324
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:45.630
Look at the Patriots for how many years we've gotten all these double digit
wins.

325
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.010
The fucking AFC east has been so god damn week,
so many years,
so many years.

326
00:19:50.011 --> 00:19:54.030
Like the jets,
who by the way beat the Jag was in the regular season.

327
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.280
The jets fucking suck.
The dolphins have sucked in the bills of sucked.

328
00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:02.010
So many those years gave Gibson,
you know,
or at least mediocre.

329
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.430
And that has given us five to six wins every fucking year.
Um,

330
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.040
anyway,
all right,
I'm done.
I'm done with,
I'm done with the Goddamn sports.

331
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.730
Let's talk about,
uh,
it was my,

332
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.500
it was my daughter's first birthday,
this,
uh,
this past weekend.

333
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.160
I can't believe it.
She's already won.
She's no longer a baby.
She's a toddler,

334
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.000
which is pretty amazing.
And I gotta be honest with you,
it's a little sad,

335
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.480
you know what I mean?
She's now motoring around the house and uh,
I dunno,

336
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:41.220
it's already going by way too fast.
And,
uh,
so anyways,

337
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:46.140
it was her birthday,
right?
So I decided to,
you know,
every year for her birthday,

338
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.360
a dad,
I'm going to make a homemade cake.
And I did it.
And uh,

339
00:20:50.361 --> 00:20:54.800
we had like,
Nia invited all of these people.
Like it's weird,

340
00:20:54.801 --> 00:20:57.050
like all of our friends,
a bunch of our friends I should say,

341
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.950
had kids in like the last year,
like the last three years.

342
00:21:01.951 --> 00:21:06.951
So we had 16 little kids over here plus their parents and a few of them brought

343
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:10.920
friends.
Like we had like a,
um,

344
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.830
we had,
we had a house party but it was just kids.
It was awesome.

345
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.330
The kids were a,
it was,

346
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.780
it was amazing man.
It just blew my mind cause I was sitting there,

347
00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:27.090
there was like 30 people in my house at least.

348
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.390
And I remember standing there thinking like,
wow,

349
00:21:30.391 --> 00:21:32.340
like literally like a year and a half ago,

350
00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:37.341
this would have been a bunch of guys sitting here smoking cigars on the back

351
00:21:37.591 --> 00:21:40.470
porch,
drinking booze.
And now I've got all these,

352
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.440
these kids running around,
all of this stuff.

353
00:21:43.441 --> 00:21:46.200
And I gotta tell you after watching all the kids,

354
00:21:46.201 --> 00:21:47.730
I'm kind of psyched I had a daughter,

355
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.440
two little girls that are made,
they're like little adults.
They just stay,

356
00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:58.590
sit there if they're emotionally stable,

357
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.880
the little boys that they're,
they're fucking lunatics.

358
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.380
They're running all over the place.
That climb.
I got this,

359
00:22:07.381 --> 00:22:11.850
this found out in my front yard and I know that,
that sounds wild bill.
Wow.

360
00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:13.470
You got a fountain in your front yard.

361
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.000
You know what I would say about our farm to go back and watch that Fred Armisen

362
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.830
sketch on SNL when he does a thing,
marble columns,

363
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.870
when they would talk it about putting marble columns on the front of Split entry

364
00:22:27.871 --> 00:22:30.720
houses.
I hate this fucking phone.

365
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.030
I've never liked it.
It's just a giant,
it's,
it's like a fucking,

366
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.790
it's just a giant place for mosquitoes to Fuckin and give us West Nile virus.

367
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.683
You know what I mean?

368
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

369
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.270
<v 0>But they give you though.
Then he'd give,</v>

370
00:22:45.271 --> 00:22:48.880
got to buy these little fucking donuts of poison that you throw in there and

371
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:52.120
then a bird comes by and drink side of it and then the bird dies.

372
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.530
So I never have any water in there.

373
00:22:54.531 --> 00:22:58.390
So these boys run out there that climbing up on the fucking thing.

374
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:01.180
I'm having a panic attack that one of them is going to fall down.

375
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.820
You get them off of that,

376
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:06.970
then they're throwing rocks down to the driveway hitting the cars.

377
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.470
I couldn't get,
you know,
the little kids.
So,
I mean,
I didn't get upset,

378
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.980
but I was just like,
wow man,
this is,
uh,

379
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.130
having a girl is a lot easy on the parenting thing.

380
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.350
I mean,
they sit down,
they're like chill.
They're thinking,
you know,

381
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.840
the boys are just like hilarious.
I Dunno if you turn your back.

382
00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:32.960
One of them's going to be,
I get an idea,
what if I jump through the screen door?

383
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.910
So,
um,

384
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.360
<v 2>yeah,</v>

385
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.040
<v 0>I dunno.
Made me feel lucky again.
So everybody gathers around,
um,</v>

386
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.710
to sing happy birthday.
And I got this cake that made and uh,

387
00:23:46.711 --> 00:23:50.400
I'd never made a cake before and I didn't,
I didn't try it out.

388
00:23:50.401 --> 00:23:53.940
I didn't want to test a slice and have a giant slice taken out.

389
00:23:53.941 --> 00:23:55.650
So I was basically,
uh,

390
00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.150
going to have 30 people all taste the cake in front of me and I was waiting for

391
00:24:00.151 --> 00:24:03.120
this tastes like shit,
the cake's too dry or whatever.
But,
uh,

392
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.600
fortunately everybody seemed to like the cake and um,

393
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.920
after that,
the whole Party was downhill.
That was,
that was like the big thing.

394
00:24:13.921 --> 00:24:15.300
I was just like,
I just have to get pat.

395
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.950
I gotta get on the other side of the cake here.

396
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.700
People eat the cake and they actually like it.
God knows.

397
00:24:20.701 --> 00:24:24.630
If my wife didn't like it,
she would've let me know,
you know?
Well,

398
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:27.750
in fact she did try the frosting the night before and she let me know that she

399
00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:30.390
thought it could have been a little more chuck.
It just tastes sweet.

400
00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.110
I just wished there was more cocoa in it,
you know what I mean?

401
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.700
And I just went like,
yeah.
And then had like a full on fucking panic attack,

402
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.963
<v 2>you know?</v>

403
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.780
<v 0>It's like,
why would you tell me that she,
you know,
I'm stressing about this shit.</v>

404
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.390
I Dunno.
That's what they do.
That's what they do.
What,
what,
what,

405
00:24:50.391 --> 00:24:52.860
what would they be doing if they weren't fucking criticizing us?

406
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.533
<v 2>Okay.</v>

407
00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.110
<v 0>Why can't there be an award show about that?
Would they protest?</v>

408
00:24:59.111 --> 00:25:02.260
The lack of complements a man gets the second he marries a woman.

409
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.160
I don't give a shit if my wife cooked his shoe.
How does it taste bill?
Oh,

410
00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:13.950
it's delicious though.
It can I board that the laces,

411
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.780
it's almost like pasta except their shoelaces.
You know,

412
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.790
put on a fucking brave face

413
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.550
Jimmy Times I've made something.
Okay,

414
00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:31.110
I've made my wife dinner and she's been the first bite she bites into.
She goes,

415
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:31.610
[inaudible],

416
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:36.390
[inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible] and then she runs over and grabs some salt

417
00:25:36.391 --> 00:25:39.810
or something like that.
Or just like if I ever fucking,

418
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.990
a few times I've ever done that,

419
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.470
I did it for,
I think for the first time since I can ever remember.

420
00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:49.390
I did it this year and I,
it was just one of those nights,

421
00:25:49.391 --> 00:25:53.980
it was late night and she was tired and she just went to the fridge and she

422
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:56.140
usually can look in there and figure something out.

423
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.290
And this time she just didn't and throw it together and it wasn't good.

424
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.370
And she was like,
how was it?
I didn't say anything.

425
00:26:03.371 --> 00:26:07.290
I just kind of gave her a look like,
and then she immediately,
she was just like,

426
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:11.830
<v 3>you think it's bad?</v>

427
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.850
<v 0>And then immediately Heidi be like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's good.
It's good.
Just,</v>

428
00:26:17.851 --> 00:26:22.560
you know,
you've made better,
you know?
And then he'd just

429
00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.870
fallen down the fucking whole.
You're like,
why did I,
why was I honest?

430
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.640
She does it to me all the fucking time.

431
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

432
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.440
<v 0>I thought this was a little dry.
I did teach would be gigging yet it's like,</v>

433
00:26:35.441 --> 00:26:37.670
oh fuck.
I feel like I'm on the,
uh,
the iron chef.

434
00:26:37.671 --> 00:26:42.040
Whenever I put something on the fucking table.
I mean,

435
00:26:42.041 --> 00:26:45.160
I'm literally talking like oatmeal.
Like if I put too much milk in there,

436
00:26:45.161 --> 00:26:50.110
she'd be like,
it's too soupy.
It's too soupy,
and I want to be like,

437
00:26:50.111 --> 00:26:53.860
you know what?
If it wasn't as hot as it was,
what bill was it?
As hard as it is,

438
00:26:53.861 --> 00:26:57.550
I would literally dump that over your fucking head.
All right.
What do you,

439
00:26:57.551 --> 00:26:59.110
what do you like a food critic?

440
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

441
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.390
<v 0>This is actually making me upset kind of a fucking person.</v>

442
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.480
Another person makes them a meal and all you do is criticize it.

443
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.150
How about you at least go,
hey,

444
00:27:11.151 --> 00:27:13.730
I really appreciated that you took the time out to make me a meal.

445
00:27:13.731 --> 00:27:14.810
That's one of the most kindest,

446
00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:18.530
loving things that one human being can do for another meeting,
a human being.

447
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.460
Having said that,
I like a little bit less milk.

448
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.190
There's no way to criticize it without coming off like a jerk.

449
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.280
I'm just in the future just to let you know,
I like a little less milk,

450
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:37.970
by the way,
making a homemade cake.
Not that hard.
It's not that hard.

451
00:27:37.971 --> 00:27:41.000
Don't be intimidated.
It's easy up making a pie.
The Pie crust,

452
00:27:41.001 --> 00:27:44.780
that's a fucking art.
Making a cake,
not that fucking hard.
Um,

453
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.100
I made a three layered cake and what's going to happen is,
um,

454
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.170
each layer is going to be a little fucking little.
Uh,

455
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.000
I know I was really hard to try and make them level.

456
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.170
I don't know how to do that yet.

457
00:27:57.171 --> 00:27:59.270
I'm sure there's something I can watch them on youtube.

458
00:27:59.271 --> 00:28:02.690
But when you go to make it,
if you know each layer cake,

459
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.560
you know if one's leaning to the left,
the other lean to the right,

460
00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:07.550
you just spin them around.

461
00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:10.250
You put them together like Legos and know that you're going to have frosting in

462
00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:14.500
the middle.
We can kind of level it out and no one's going to notice my,
my,

463
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.570
my cake had a little lean to it.
Nothing crazy.
Um,

464
00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:22.670
probably the hardest thing is frosting the cake.
Um,

465
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.280
I started to watch videos on that,
but it was just,
that was just too full.

466
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.650
It was just too fucking boring.
And there was all this playoff football on.

467
00:28:30.651 --> 00:28:35.120
I wanted to watch that.
So,
um,
I probably could've done a better job at that.

468
00:28:35.121 --> 00:28:37.760
I don't know.
I'll ask my wife,
God knows she'll fucking tell me right.

469
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:44.150
But enough with me complaining about her complaining.
Right.
I should,
I should be,

470
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.950
I should be secure enough
in my own baking skills.

471
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.690
Um,
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

472
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.230
no,
no.
You did this one wrong.
You know,
I was trying to,

473
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:04.210
cause I never a lot of shit to talk about,
uh,
this week.
Um,

474
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.640
other than just being completely blown away that my daughter's already a year

475
00:29:07.641 --> 00:29:10.960
old.
I can't believe it.
And,
uh,

476
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.630
I got her up this morning,
you know,

477
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.140
and I just couldn't believe how big she was.

478
00:29:17.141 --> 00:29:21.380
And I was already thinking like she used to be able to fit like her head would

479
00:29:21.381 --> 00:29:25.520
go from my elbow,
not even to the tips of my fingers.

480
00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:28.160
Like I could just hold it just like that.

481
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.060
Now she just,
she's,
she's huge.
What happened?

482
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.430
You know,
there's nothing I can now see why people have a bunch of kids.

483
00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:42.730
Cause you keep wanting to hit reset.

484
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.590
There's nothing better than having a baby around your house.
It's the greatest.

485
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:51.420
It's like a puppy times a million.
Um,

486
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.640
but what is cool is she starting to talk.
So I'm waiting for these,

487
00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:01.060
uh,
the conversation cause some of the kids,
my God,
they were hilarious.

488
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.580
Um,
there was this little boy,
right?
And he was talking to this,

489
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.400
they wanted to see like outside my house,
like along the side.
So I got all right,

490
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.520
I'll take you over there.
Just be careful.
Cause you know,

491
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.450
there's all these concrete steps and shit.
I don't want somebody's fallen down.

492
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.940
So,
uh,
he points to his side of the house.
He goes,
what?

493
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:25.970
This and a,
I go,
oh that's the back of the chimney.

494
00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.850
And it was a little kid.
He goes,
what's that?

495
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.220
And then the little girl answers and she goes,

496
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.570
that's where Santa Claus comes down and the smoke goes up when you have a fire.

497
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.650
Then I think the little kid like the girl,
and he goes,
he says to me,
he goes,

498
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.460
does she live here?
And I started the answer.

499
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:51.340
The girl once again answered the question.
She goes,
no.
She goes,

500
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:56.050
I live out in the desert and the boy goes in the sand.

501
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.310
She goes,
now what the heck?

502
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.300
Kit was bombing.
I was pulling for him.
I was like,
Oh,

503
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:11.320
you don't say something funny,
make a lap.
Um,
whatever.

504
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.740
I just liked that he was working on his game at like four years of age.

505
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.300
Um,
which reminded me when I was a little kid.

506
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:21.430
I liked this girl who lived in my neighborhood.

507
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:26.560
So I just went over a house,
not even invited.

508
00:31:26.561 --> 00:31:30.940
I just went over her house,
knocked on the door,
take her name was Michelle.

509
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.090
I knocked in the door to mommy and says,
I was like,
yeah,
hey,

510
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:37.990
it's Michelle Holmes.
She goes,
yeah,
she's sitting there watching TV.
And I go,

511
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:38.710
okay.

512
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:43.710
So I went in there and I sat down and watched TV with the her,

513
00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:47.350
her mother,
and I think her younger sibling.

514
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:50.650
And I never said a word for like an hour.

515
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.820
I just sat there watching t cause I didn't know it all.

516
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.820
I didn't know what to do.
And then I just got up and left.

517
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.270
I always wondered what that woman was thinking.

518
00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:05.500
Like this little redheaded boy came over to visit my,
our,
our daughter today.

519
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.740
Honey.
He came,
he didn't say a word then he left.

520
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.760
I said an odd little fellow.
Um,
anyways.

521
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.650
All right,
let me read a little bit advertising here for this week.
All right.

522
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:19.780
Dollar Shave Club.
Joe.

523
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.290
I remember there was another girl I had a crush on.

524
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:27.940
There was these two twins when I was in first grade and I had a crush on one of

525
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:31.420
them.
And uh,
the other one had this giant pen,

526
00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.600
which I thought was the coolest thing ever.
Even though it was pink,

527
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.490
it was just a giant pen,

528
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.040
which was amazing in early seventies

529
00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.480
<v 4>like there was no fucking computers and share,</v>

530
00:32:42.481 --> 00:32:44.430
I guess they were wearable computers with gigantic.

531
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.120
So she dropped it on the floor and she didn't realize it.

532
00:32:48.121 --> 00:32:51.220
And I took it and then I started writing with it.

533
00:32:51.221 --> 00:32:54.960
It was funny was the way they had the desk set up.

534
00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.770
They had like us in like little groups of four and we faced each other and she

535
00:33:00.901 --> 00:33:05.901
was diagonal to me and I'm writing with this giant pink pen and she's gone.

536
00:33:06.241 --> 00:33:07.170
That's my pen.

537
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.210
<v 0>And I was like,
no,
it isn't.
It's mine.
So she's like an idiot.</v>

538
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:12.560
And then she tells the teacher,

539
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.070
<v 1>okay,</v>

540
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.670
<v 4>and then she's going to Billy,
is that your pen?
And I was like,
yes.</v>

541
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.440
And then the girl's going,
no,
it was my pet.
I was going,
no,
it is.
And it's my pen.

542
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.210
And then she did teach you just like,

543
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.640
I don't think your mom would buy you a pig pen.

544
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:32.280
And she took it and gave it back to the girl.
And you know,
as a little kid,

545
00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:35.490
like the embarrassment of that goes away like eight seconds later,

546
00:33:35.491 --> 00:33:37.820
you can't even remember.
Like,
you know,

547
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.810
you don't have like the mental capacity to be like,

548
00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:41.760
did I just really try to pull that off?

549
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

550
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:48.250
<v 4>You know,
why the fuck would I do that?
Right.
So then I remember I went out,</v>

551
00:33:48.251 --> 00:33:49.630
asked and I had to go to the bathroom.

552
00:33:49.631 --> 00:33:54.220
So I went out to the bathroom and her twin sister,
the one I had the crush on,
oh,

553
00:33:54.221 --> 00:33:58.120
this is like the next day I went out to go to the bathroom and her twin sister,

554
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.190
<v 0>who I had a crush on</v>

555
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.440
k walking out at the same time.
And when she saw me,

556
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:09.950
she really put her eyebrows down.
She goes,
I heard what you did.

557
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:14.570
I heard you tried to steal my sister's pen.
And I just looked at,
I think I said,

558
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.230
no I didn't.
And I just walked away.
And that was the end of that romance.

559
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.690
Um,
oh,
there's a lot of sad stories.
All right.
Dollar Shave club,
everybody.

560
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.950
<v 1>Okay?</v>

561
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:30.060
<v 0>Everyone knows dollar shave club ships.
Amazing raises for a few bucks.</v>

562
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.560

You know what's funny?

582
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.580
The only time I noticed that my Invisalign in at this point is when I go to read

583
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:52.430
this copy.
I already suck at reading out loud,

584

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.680
<v 1>okay.</v>

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.170
<v 0>Yeah,
I've got to tell you I'm happy that I'm doing it.</v>

590
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.610
They're happy that I'm doing it,
you know,

591
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.550
then all I to do for the rest of my life is at night.

592
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.260
It's throwing a little fucking mouth guard to keep the teeth where they're where

593
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:19.890
they are.
And I'll have all of these will have nice teeth like Farrah Fawcett,

you know,
I'll fucking white.

596
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.490
so it looks like led lights coming out of the year.
Old fucking proved up face.

All right.
Movement watches everybody.
MVMT.
Uh,

598
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.170
and it's that time of year when you could say,

599
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.340
I'd like a nice watch for no money.
All right?

600
00:36:44.341 --> 00:36:46.260
And it's that time of year again.
Uh,

601
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.320
you thought gift giving was all over after Christmas,

602
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:53.490
but Valentine's Day is coming up and you know what that means?

603
00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.930
That means that guy has to spend money and the woman does not,

604
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.970
even though it's both of your relationships,
right?

605
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.790
It's both of your relationship,
I should say.

606
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:07.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

607
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.510
<v 0>I mean,
if we really want to have everything equal,</v>

608
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:13.080
how about every other year the lady pays for it,
right?

609
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:16.200
Takes you out for a steak dinner.
Okay.

610
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:19.680
Blows you in the back of the Uber on the way home.
Just,
you know,
make an effort.

611
00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:23.820
Ladies,
just make an effort by,
but Valentine's Day is coming up,
so you know,

612
00:37:23.821 --> 00:37:26.100
you must find the perfect gift.

613
00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.790
You know what I love about the fact that I'm already married is I don't have to

614
00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:35.230
deal with the pressure,
this fucking horse shit anymore.
You know what I mean?

615
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.160
That whole,
where is this relationship going?
Oh,
shut up.

616
00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.810
Shut the fuck up.

617
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.310
Talk about how you may have procrastinated in the past or your own experience

618
00:37:45.311 --> 00:37:48.670
with how hard finding the perfect Valentine's Day gift can be.

619
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:50.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

620
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.730
<v 0>Well,
you know,
you,
who the fuck knows what a woman wants,
right?</v>

621
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.000
Jesus Christ that change.

622
00:37:55.001 --> 00:37:58.110
There's every five seconds and God knows it's going to be expensive.

623
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.620
What if you don't have a lot of money and the woman you went,

624
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:04.800
so you just sort of banging,
then you're not sure if you're going to marry you,

625
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:08.130
but you got to get her something nice so she'll keep touching it,
right?

626
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.970
Would it be nice to be goodbye or nice watch,
but not break the bank?

627
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.080

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.990
my shows,
what am I trying to,
when a whore myself out,

707
00:42:49.991 --> 00:42:52.000
I'm going to sell posters at the end of the show.

708
00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:56.410
I use stamps.com to get them there and I'm a moron.

714
00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:19.600
but a,
but a book is a story of a bald headed freckled count.

715
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.060
Alright.
Alright,

716
00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.930
let's read some questions here for the week and let's get going.
Billy,

717
00:43:25.931 --> 00:43:28.810
you stupid La Conte.
All right,
here we go.

718
00:43:28.811 --> 00:43:32.470
You never mentioned why exactly you move to La.

719
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.000
I didn't know I was required to.
Why did you move to la?

720
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:41.120
I just listened to you and Jim Florin cunt.

721
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

722
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.620
<v 0>Slash Florentine.
He said,
uh,</v>

723
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.630
and Florentine said he didn't see a difference with comedians in New York City.

724
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.050
I find it hard to imagine that La,

725
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.770
<v 1>okay.</v>

726
00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.420
<v 0>Oh God,
this guy,
I find it hard to amount.</v>

727
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.980
I'm just going to read exactly what road.
I find it hard to imagine that La,

728
00:44:01.981 --> 00:44:06.720
there are a lot less content and the audience that get offended too easily,

729
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:08.280
uh,

730
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:13.280
you then agreed with Jim that maybe it's because you now live there and are used

731
00:44:13.771 --> 00:44:17.550
to it.
But the way you said it didn't seem believable.

732
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.500
So what's the deal?

733
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:21.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

734
00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:25.280
<v 0>All right.
Like there wasn't one capitol letter,</v>

735
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.910
no punctuation whatsoever.
A couple of periods maybe.
Um,

736
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.350
I'm not required to tell you why I fucking moved out here,

737
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:35.140
but I will to eat up some time.
Um,

738
00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:36.640
<v 1>okay.</v>

739
00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.660
<v 0>I was living in New York.
I was just sick of being there.
It just,</v>

740
00:44:40.661 --> 00:44:44.830
it just gets a point where you know,
you get to be told too old and you're like,

741
00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.660
I can't live like an animal anymore.

742
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:51.700
Which means you're either going to move outside the city or in my business,

743
00:44:51.701 --> 00:44:52.780
you're going to go to la.

744
00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.400
And I had nothing going on in my career other than the OPN Anthony show.

745
00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:02.710
But the writing was on the wall with that show where you know,

746
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.500
<v 1>okay,</v>

747
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:09.420
<v 0>those guys,
like they had a bunch of comics on and I was one of them.</v>

748
00:45:09.421 --> 00:45:14.421
Jim Norton got us all in and you know,

749
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.030
there was no money in the budget to pay us as,

750
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.680
but the way that they paid us opie and Anthony Show,

751
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:21.690
because they are the salt of the fucking earth,

752
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.170
they used to run advertisements of our gigs.

753
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:31.080
And um,
then our gigs would sell out and it was great.

754
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:35.430
But then the corporate cons there said that they couldn't do it anymore.

755
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:36.631
You know,

756
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:41.631
so then you kind of had to hype your show during the show,

757
00:45:41.671 --> 00:45:45.420
which would get in the way of,
you know,
whatever craziness was going on.

758
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.660
So that's kind of where my career was at.

759
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:51.090
I was on a radio show and I wasn't getting paid.

760
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:53.010
I wasn't getting any acting work.

761
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:58.920
And the only way I was getting paid on the opiate Anthony showed they no longer

762
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:02.900
let them do
for whatever reason,

763
00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.060
which is really shortsighted

764
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.740
on Sirius XM s side because opie and Anthony were this launching pad for standup

765
00:46:15.501 --> 00:46:19.640
careers.
And they will make in like
they,

766
00:46:19.641 --> 00:46:22.440
they made us become like these draws.

767
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.143
<v 1>MMM.</v>

768
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.600
<v 0>And then that would then feed back into the show because then these people was</v>

769
00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.790
selling all these tickets were like,
hey,
I'm going to be an open anti show.
So it,

770
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:36.100
you know,
you know what way,
what does it totally fucking work?

771
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:41.530
It was the perfect fucking relationship for about three years.

772
00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.450
And then like what always happens is the money people come in and they fucked

773
00:46:46.451 --> 00:46:47.380
the whole thing up.

774
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.490
So I mean that's not the only reason I was,

775
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.560
I was uh,
leaving.
But that's basically,
that was his,

776
00:46:55.630 --> 00:47:00.370
it's high up as I got in New York.
I was on a radio show not getting paid.

777
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.030
That's it.
That's the best I could do.

778
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.170
I had already done an episode of law and order,
so you know,

779
00:47:08.171 --> 00:47:11.710
and I couldn't get on the soprano's cause that was a bunch of Italians and I

780
00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:15.880
look like fucking idiot Billy red face over here.
So,
uh,
the,

781
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:20.910
there was like no opportunity left from me and I was going down to the comedy

782
00:47:21.431 --> 00:47:25.060
cellar like every single night and it was like,

783
00:47:25.061 --> 00:47:28.680
it was like groundhog day and I just,
uh,

784
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.410
you and I went out to la and I hated La and I just came out here and I started

785
00:47:33.411 --> 00:47:33.541
to do,

786
00:47:33.541 --> 00:47:36.670
each time I went out I was starting to like it and I was fighting that feeling

787
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.910
and uh,
I dunno,
I just said fuck it.
One day it's like,
you know what,

788
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.500
I wouldn't mind living in an apartment,
paying a ton of money,

789
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:51.010
but I could actually have like a couch that also wasn't my bed.

790
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.880
I wouldn't mind having a car.
I hadn't.
Then I moved out here.

791
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.900
I had this apartment,
it was still a one bedroom,

792
00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.250
but I had front end backstairs the backstairs I did share with my neighbor,

793
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.110
but still,
that was amazing to me.

794
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.040
And I had a garage where I could park my car.

795
00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:11.380
And even though the traffic was fucking horrific,

796
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.850
just the fact that I could live a little more like a human being again,

797
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.960
um,
was appealing.

798
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.140
And then there was a ton of acting work out here that I could potentially get.

799
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:27.700
And I moved out here and within the first year,
um,

800
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.800
I got on breaking bad.
So that's why I came out here.

801
00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:34.030
But I do have to tell you that the,

802
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:37.450
that I thought when I came out here that the comedy scene was horrific.

803
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:43.390
So what I was trying to say on the podcast is when I go back to the New York

804
00:48:43.391 --> 00:48:46.840
now,
it's just like,
it's just,
I think it's just changed,

805
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:50.920
but because I'm not there every day,
I noticed the change.

806
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.770
Um,
and out here last night,
you know,

807
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:55.810
I was telling a couple of jokes and there was silent.

808
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:58.810
So maybe that's what it was.
I don't know why you took it.
So,
uh,

809
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.950
so personally,
but that is a big fucking thing.

810
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:07.720
The whole east coast west coast thing.
Um,
I do,
however,

811
00:49:07.721 --> 00:49:11.980
I'm one of those weird people that I do love both coasts,
but uh,

812
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.260
you know,
I dunno,
I'm kind of out here right now.

813
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.750
I used to think like I'll always move back,
but now I don't,

814
00:49:18.751 --> 00:49:22.230
I don't know that I will.
Who knows?
I don't fucking know.
I have no idea.

815
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:24.420
I was kinda thinking about global warming.

816
00:49:24.421 --> 00:49:27.000
Eventually I was going to Ha I was going to have to move back there,

817
00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:30.900
but now it seems like it's going to be all crazy weather.

818
00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:34.320
So the fact that it was hot out here now it's going to be extremely hot.

819
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:36.870
And the fact that it was cold back there,

820
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.550
now it's going to be extremely fucking cold.
And uh,
I dunno.

821
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:46.950
I did like 40 some winters.
Becky's okay.

822
00:49:46.951 --> 00:49:50.830
I put my time in.
All right.
I'd rather shovel out of a mud.

823
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:55.170
Slide 10 this snuff.
So there you go.
Alright.

824
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.640
Alright,
Bill,
my problems with women,
this is funny.

825
00:49:59.641 --> 00:50:03.690
He wrote my problems with woman.
Oh my problems with woman

826
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:09.120
dear bills burry.
Doughboy oh,
I love that one.
All right.

827
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:13.730
I'm a huge fan from,
I don't even know how to say this.

828
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:19.650
F.
E.
R.
M.
A.
N.
A.
G.
H.
Okay.

829
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:25.560
Furman na Nog.
I don't know.
Ireland,

830
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:26.483
Ireland.

831
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:30.910
I'm 17 years old and I've always been a fat cunt.

832
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:34.950
Well,
that's good,
man.
You're,
you're,
you're looking at yourself.
Honestly.
No,

833
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.490
it's what it,
what can we do about this?

834
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:40.750
But recently I lost the weight and started getting into the gym.
There you go.

835
00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.240
I'm now six one and 200 pounds.

836
00:50:43.241 --> 00:50:47.920
So naturally have started getting more female attention.
All right,

837
00:50:47.921 --> 00:50:50.410
this is all good.
I was never been,

838
00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.980
I was never been successful with women,

839
00:50:53.981 --> 00:50:58.840
but now I'm turning this franchise around.
There you go.
Well dude,
you're only 17.

840
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.550
You just getting out of the gate here.

841
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:04.960
My only problem is I'm a quiet guy and don't not to talk to them.

842
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:09.460
They seem to just want to talk about bullshit,
our gossip and meaningless crap.

843
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:13.210
Oh God,
dude,
you can't be this cynical.
It's 17.

844
00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.080
The sound like me right now and I'm going to be 50.
Um,

845
00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:23.050
I try and be funny and make them laugh,
which can only get me so far.

846
00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:28.110
I can't maintain a relationship because they open their mouths and I contemplate

847
00:51:28.331 --> 00:51:32.950
suicide.
Jesus,
he sounded like a writer.

848
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:38.080
You creative or something
or you think too much?

849
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.550
Uh,
I consider myself as straightforward,
no bs kind of guy,

850
00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:47.800
but I'm just a winker.
Uh,
is this a problem with me or them?

851
00:51:47.801 --> 00:51:51.520
I don't hate women.
I just don't get along with them.
If possible.

852
00:51:51.521 --> 00:51:53.740
I would love to hear what Nia has to say.
Oh,

853
00:51:53.741 --> 00:51:57.100
she wouldn't like how you worded all of this.
Uh,
thanks bill.

854
00:51:57.101 --> 00:51:59.500
And Go fuck yourself.
Ps,
if you're getting into soccer,

855
00:51:59.501 --> 00:52:04.120
I suggest you support either Tottenham or Liverpool is they have young,

856
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:08.890
exciting teams and aren't soulless corporate entities like Chelsea and Man City.

857
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.270
Oh,
I didn't know that.
All right.

858
00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.013
<v 2>Okay.</v>

859
00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:16.890
<v 0>All Support Liverpool.
Then it's where the Beatles and farm,
right.</v>

860
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:20.760
I don't know fucking know where.
Anyways.
Um,

861
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.620
all right.
What's your problem?
Uh,
I don't know.
I think you're a little defensive.

862
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.090
I think you're a little insecure,
so you're kind of projecting on them.

863
00:52:30.091 --> 00:52:33.420
I know that that's what I did.
Uh,

864
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.070
so I would say open yourself up a little bit more and,

865
00:52:38.071 --> 00:52:42.480
uh,
you know,
realize how amazing they are.

866
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:46.770
But women are just like men,
the good one is hard to find.

867
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:51.870
Good woman,
hard to find.
So you're only 17 too.

868
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.640
And I think also trying to make them laugh is always a good thing.
And,
uh,

869
00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:01.690
what I've learned is a lot of times they just want you to listen and,
uh,

870
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.660
they don't want you to try to solve their problems.

871
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:10.910
So just,
you know,
when they tell a story,
hold both their hands,
it'd be like,

872
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:15.350
oh my God.
Uh,
I dunno.

873
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.750
Why would you ask me like,
I know anything about women?
Jesus Christ,

874
00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:24.800
they fucking hate me.
My fan base is a fucking sausage fest.

875
00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.640
Um,
I got to give you more advice than that.
Uh,

876
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:38.030
yeah,
dude,
this is a weakness of mine.
Understanding women.
I have no idea.

877
00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.760
You just basically a

878
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.753
<v 1>okay.</v>

879
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.180
<v 0>I Dunno.
It's like right.
And Charlie Manson being like,
hey,</v>

880
00:53:44.181 --> 00:53:49.070
how do I get along with people a little more,
a little more better?
Um,

881
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:54.460
he's probably a bad example,
right?
They need just die.
What a fucking life.
Huh?

882
00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.000
What a fucking life.

883
00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.020
I just can't imagine spending that much time in jail.

884
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.240
Like he never getting out again.
You're in your thirties,

885
00:54:04.241 --> 00:54:08.920
you're never getting out again.
Okay.
You're not just sitting there like,

886
00:54:08.921 --> 00:54:13.680
really?
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
Um,

887
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.350
fascinating guy.

888
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.840
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

889
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.850
<v 0>they didn't all the wrong reasons.
You know,
like you really like,</v>

890
00:54:21.851 --> 00:54:25.000
I literally never come in as far as we know.
Never committed a murder,

891
00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:30.040
but was such a fucking lunatic.
I remember seeing a horror movie.

892
00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.320
<v 1>Okay,</v>

893
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.190
<v 0>we're all a guy to do.</v>

894
00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:34.920
It was just whisper in somebody's ear or something like that and then they just

895
00:54:34.921 --> 00:54:36.900
fucking would just do whatever the guy said.

896
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:42.750
Just had that a bit like literally the fucking devil he spent his whole life,

897
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:44.370
you know?
Just imagine if he ever,
you know,

898
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.940
if he got Micky Dolenz as part of the monkeys.

899
00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.513
<v 1>It's unreal.</v>

900
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.400
<v 0>Somebody like Hitler's drawings,</v>

901
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:58.090
so you have to encourage people.
Alright.
Westerns.

902
00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.570
Everybody a dear Billy Sundance.
Billy the Sundance.
Okay.

903
00:55:01.571 --> 00:55:04.750
I've been just getting into Western.
I wasn't a huge fan as a kid,

904
00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:09.550
I was more into space and futuristic stuff.
But as a around my mid twenties,

905
00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.750
and I'm living more of a loner life,
I'm starting to connect more.

906
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:19.120
I'm really looking forward to the new Christian Bale movie.

907
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.880
Hostiles Oh,
I can't wait to see that.

908
00:55:21.881 --> 00:55:26.470
I hope I said that correctly because I loved three 10 to Yuma.

909
00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.900
I loved the original to my other favorites are tombstone and butch Cassidy.

910
00:55:31.901 --> 00:55:36.901
I was hoping to hear which one your favorites are and get some recommendations

911
00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.050
to watch while I'm snowed in for the next four days.

912
00:55:41.051 --> 00:55:44.500
All the best to you and your family.
I would say a the Clint Eastwood's,

913
00:55:44.501 --> 00:55:49.000
the Spaghetti Westerns fistful of dollars.
The good,
the bad and the ugly.

914
00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.900
Uh,
he had like a trilogy of those,

915
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:58.670
um,
the outlaw Josey Wales,
you know,
I hate to say this,

916
00:55:58.671 --> 00:56:01.910
but I've never seen the unforgiven that was right when I started doing stand up

917
00:56:01.911 --> 00:56:06.860
and I just started missing out on shit.
Um,
I like those.

918
00:56:06.861 --> 00:56:08.060
The wild bunch.

919
00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:10.630
<v 1>MMM.</v>

920
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:17.280
<v 0>Let's see,
uh,
the magnificent seven.</v>

921
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.600
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

922
00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:23.430
<v 0>the original Westworld.
There's one that combines futurists.
Future,</v>

923
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:27.990
a rustic shit there.
Um,
Psi Phi and Westerns.

924
00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:32.040
Yule Brenner is incredible in that Yule Brenner one of my favorites of all time

925
00:56:32.041 --> 00:56:36.090
now because he's bald like me,
but I just thought he was the shit.
Um,

926
00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.480
I never saw butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.

927
00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:42.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

928
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.010
<v 0>Yeah.
I think that I would say that,
that,
that was all of them.</v>

929
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.750
I know never quite into the John Wayne one.

930
00:56:47.751 --> 00:56:49.390
So it's the ones who are too far back in the day.

931
00:56:49.391 --> 00:56:54.190
I like the ones from like the 60s.
I liked those and I liked all the war movies.

932
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:58.840
Kelly's heroes,
dirty dozen bridge over the river.
Kwai Oh,
that Shit.

933
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:04.510
Um,
so those are my recommendations.
I would go with the Clint Eastwood,
uh,

934
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:09.550
Spaghetti Westerns.
All right.
My life's fucked.
My fucked life.

935
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:13.640
Sorry.
My fucked life.
That sounds like a Sitcom,
right?

936
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:20.140
Oh,
fuck the battery.
Did the battery just die?
All the battery's gonna die.

937
00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.080
Oh fuck.
I gotta wrap this up.
All right,
my fuck life.
Hey,

938
00:57:25.081 --> 00:57:29.040
if I don't get through all this,
thank you to everybody for listening.
And,
uh,

939
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:29.671
once again,

940
00:57:29.671 --> 00:57:33.210
congratulations to the Patriots and the Eagles and congratulations to the

941
00:57:33.211 --> 00:57:35.670
Jaguars and the Vikings on two great seasons though,

942
00:57:35.671 --> 00:57:38.940
right before grades sees us here,
right?
My fuck life,
dear bill and Nia,

943
00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.780
I'm 17 and still in high school.
I'm a bit of a,

944
00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:49.260
a bit of a pickle.
What the fuck is wrong with this?
Think it keeps beeping.

945
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.680
I think I'm falling from my best friend.

946
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.710
I realized after we were falling asleep at her house,

947
00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:00.300
she had just taken off from makeup and made a joke like,
sorry,
I look so bad.

948
00:58:00.301 --> 00:58:01.230
But when I looked at her,

949
00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:04.410
I thought she looked so beautiful and cute and her sweatshirt,

950
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:07.980
that was just a little too big for her.

951
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.650
What does his flashdance however,
she's currently dating a cunt.
Well,

952
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.850
what the fuck are you doing over a house?

953
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.870
All right,
I'm back.
I guess my,
my recorder was almost filled up.

954
00:58:21.871 --> 00:58:25.800
Sorry about that sound.
We had to fucking attitude things together as always,

955
00:58:25.801 --> 00:58:30.030
as always making my life difficult.
Um,
anyways.
Yeah.

956
00:58:30.031 --> 00:58:34.500
So what are you doing over at this person's house?
She's dating somebody else.

957
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.780
Anyway,
she goes,
he's a loser.

958
00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:41.850
No Job's still gets an allowance and expensive car that his mommy bought him,

959
00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:44.130
sits at home all day playing video games,

960
00:58:44.131 --> 00:58:48.090
getting stone and treats people like he's above them.
She knows I hate him.

961
00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:52.560
And I openly mock him,
um,
in front of our friends,

962
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:55.030
her and even him.
Uh,

963
00:58:55.140 --> 00:59:00.140
like he got her this really generic but expensive looking hard shape necklace.

964
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.090
Um,
when she showed it to everyone,
I looked at him and said,
loudly,
wow,

965
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:11.270
must've cost your mom quite a big whatever that means.

966
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:16.260
As you can imagine,
he tries to avoid me.
Yeah,
well you're being a fucking cunt.

967
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.870
Uh,
we share the same friends and they hate him and liked me.

968
00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:26.950
But mind you,
I'm no prize either.
I'm trying to get a job.

969
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.890
Unlike him out Jesus,
you don't even have a fucking job.

970
00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.930
And then saving up for a car.

971
00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:37.540
So our choices are two guys who don't have a job and he has a rich mom.
Well,

972
00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:41.710
there you go.
I tend to be nice,
a nice guy,

973
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:46.680
but can at times piss people off with my jokes and even be a deck with my jokes.

974
00:59:46.681 --> 00:59:48.940
She sound like you're being a dick.
I'm not saying you are,

975
00:59:48.941 --> 00:59:52.420
but you're being addicted.
This guy,
he's at least three inches taller than me.

976
00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:55.510
Enhance summer,
better looking,

977
00:59:56.020 --> 01:00:01.020
I guess he's got this great smile that makes me want to fuck him up for sure.

978
01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.450
Well that makes me want to fuck it up for him.

979
01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:11.010
But recently I've started to turn my life around,
quit bare porn and drugs.

980
01:00:11.011 --> 01:00:15.360
My grades are going up,
applying for college,
working out a lot,

981
01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:19.290
but all this in hopes of catching her ride.
Like I said,

982
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.780
she's my best friend and as a boyfriend,

983
01:00:21.781 --> 01:00:23.730
so I really don't know how to handle this.

984
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:28.380
Any help from you and Neil would be greatly appreciated.
Uh,
yeah dude.
Um,

985
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.930
I would start fishing in a different watering hole.

986
01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:32.900
<v 1>All right.</v>

987
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:34.821
<v 0>You know,</v>

988
01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:39.821
for you to sit there and stand there and be a con to her boyfriend talking about

989
01:00:40.581 --> 01:00:43.940
a boyfriend and you're going over that for over a fucking house.

990
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:46.483
<v 1>MMM.</v>

991
01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.240
<v 0>It sounds to me like you're,
you're,
you're less.</v>

992
01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.730
Chris Rock says you're in the friend zone.
So what you need,

993
01:00:55.810 --> 01:01:00.610
what you need is you need some time away from her.
All right?

994
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.480
Move on with your fucking life.
Keep working out.
Get you shit going.

995
01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:05.891
And who knows?

996
01:01:05.891 --> 01:01:10.330
You might just meet somebody else and then eventually when she dumps this loser,

997
01:01:10.331 --> 01:01:12.850
she comes around and sees you.
She'll be,
oh my God,
look at you.

998
01:01:12.851 --> 01:01:16.990
You're going to college.
You look gray given working out,
you know,
watch porn.

999
01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:19.420
Who knows?
Maybe it'll happen,
but I can tell you,

1000
01:01:19.421 --> 01:01:22.570
it's definitely not going to happen.
If you could just going to be your friend.

1001
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:27.760
They're making snide remarks about her,
her boyfriend.
Come on.

1002
01:01:27.761 --> 01:01:31.960
Do you gotta be better than that?
That's just coming off like a,
you know,

1003
01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:36.280
you're acting like a fucking,
you're acting like a Douche.
I know.

1004
01:01:36.281 --> 01:01:39.610
I don't know how else to put it.
Um,
that's not a strong move.

1005
01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.820
<v 1>All right.
Um,</v>

1006
01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:47.540
<v 0>and you should have more going on in your life then the fucker be,
you know,</v>

1007
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.930
you should have more self esteem than that.
All right?
Okay.

1008
01:01:50.931 --> 01:01:55.620
She wants to date this fucking guy.
Guess what?
It's her loss.
Alright,

1009
01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.950
so fuck it.
Get on with your life.
Keep working out and work out for yourself.

1010
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:04.610
Go to college for yourself,
do all this shit for yourself.

1011
01:02:04.611 --> 01:02:05.900
Feel good about yourself.

1012
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.820
You start putting out more of a positive vibe and it's supposed to,
you know,

1013
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:15.620
hanging around her,
shitting on her current boyfriend.
I mean that's just like,

1014
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.810
I don't know.
That's not a good look.
Okay.
I believe in you.
All right.

1015
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:22.430
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1016
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:27.320
<v 0>Do what I just said
cause I don't have any professional training.</v>

1017
01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:32.000
All right.
Dumping my girlfriend a Billy billboard.
Brow

1018
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:37.760
fucking asshole.
That's another good one.
Recent fatty,

1019
01:02:37.761 --> 01:02:40.700
a podcast stand up and all that jazz.
Anyways,

1020
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.160
I'm a 24 year old dude and I've been dating and living with my girl for almost

1021
01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:48.380
four years now and I finally had enough.

1022
01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:52.100
She's a real Downer and talk shit about people including your friends,

1023
01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.230
like it's an Olympic sport now.

1024
01:02:54.231 --> 01:02:58.160
The problem is she lost a job a month ago on account of her shit talking.

1025
01:02:58.161 --> 01:03:02.210
It hasn't exactly been going out and looking for a new one because she's anxious

1026
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:05.600
or whatever.
Leaving me to pick up her end of the bills.

1027
01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.320
She didn't have any savings because she had picked up the habit of going out and

1028
01:03:09.321 --> 01:03:13.250
drinking every night.
I honestly wouldn't have a problem,
uh,

1029
01:03:13.251 --> 01:03:14.540
just up and leaving.

1030
01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:19.980
But the apartment is a stone's throw from the beach and my other roommate and I

1031
01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:21.590
really don't want to leave

1032
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:28.200
the fucking decisions people make.
It's right near the beach.
Uh,

1033
01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.890
the other roommate is my best friend.
Okay.

1034
01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:35.891
She's got a lot of books and shit and the bed is hers so wouldn't be a little,

1035
01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.260
so would be a little difficult to do.

1036
01:03:39.261 --> 01:03:43.070
The old put all their stuff in a box trick a deep down.

1037
01:03:43.071 --> 01:03:46.520
I do still have love for her.

1038
01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.100
So the idea of kicking her out hurts my heart,

1039
01:03:49.101 --> 01:03:52.070
but I just can't deal with the endless drama and unhappiness.

1040
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.080
We'd love to hear what your advice on the podcast and as always go fuck

1041
01:03:57.081 --> 01:03:58.200
yourself.
Yeah.
The there,

1042
01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:03.220
the relationship has run its course and you need to go your separate ways.

1043
01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.750
And sometimes when that happens,
you know,
somebody,
yeah,
somebody gets hurt.

1044
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:10.003
All right?

1045
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.820
But you're not doing her any favors if you don't want to or to be with you and

1046
01:04:13.821 --> 01:04:17.840
you just,
you just wasting her and your time.
So,

1047
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:21.210
uh,
you know,

1048
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.330
this is why you don't fucking live with somebody unless you know you're going to

1049
01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:31.770
marry him.
I don't,
I don't know.
I don't know if
a boy,

1050
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:34.920
uh,
so what do you do?

1051
01:04:34.921 --> 01:04:37.920
Break up with her and then tell him to move out all at the same time?

1052
01:04:37.921 --> 01:04:42.840
Or are those two separate conversations?
I just break up with her

1053
01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:49.020
and then let her bring up where am I going to live.
And I'd be like,
well,

1054
01:04:49.021 --> 01:04:51.090
I don't know.
I mean,
the coastline is pretty long,

1055
01:04:51.091 --> 01:04:54.390
so I'm sure there's another beachfront apartment she could be in.

1056
01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:59.010
I'm assuming your name's on the lease.
Usually when there's a breakup,

1057
01:04:59.011 --> 01:05:01.020
the guy has to leave and leave half his shit.

1058
01:05:01.021 --> 01:05:04.610
So it seems like you were in a decent position here.
Uh,

1059
01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.160
who wants a negative drunk without a job?
I don't think you want,

1060
01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:10.890
that doesn't sound like you want it.
Um,

1061
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:14.820
I think the love you have for her was who she used to be or who you thought she

1062
01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:18.570
was.
So
neither

1063
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:19.890
<v 4>those are happening right now.</v>

1064
01:05:19.891 --> 01:05:24.330
So it's time for you to tell her to hit the bricks.
Happy new year,
sweetheart.

1065
01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:27.210
<v 0>Beat it.
You can't say it like that.</v>

1066
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.760
I just tell her,
look,
we need to talk and sit down.
She could be,

1067
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.930
what's the problem?
What's the problem?

1068
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.670
Me and you just got to fight through that fucking horrible feeling.

1069
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.420
There's nothing worse.

1070
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:45.890
The only worse than a woman crying is when she's about to cry because you still

1071
01:05:45.891 --> 01:05:48.980
have hope that she's not going to cry.
So you're on pins and needles.

1072
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:52.520
Once she's crying,
you're like,
fuck,
this sucks.

1073
01:05:52.521 --> 01:05:56.900
But you kind of know what's going to happen.
Um,
yeah.

1074
01:05:56.901 --> 01:06:01.280
You just got to sit her down and just say,
listen,
I'm not happy.

1075
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.390
This isn't working for me anymore and

1076
01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:08.350
<v 2>okay,</v>

1077
01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:12.880
<v 0>we need to break up.
All right.
Just like that.
Boom,</v>

1078
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:18.190
boom,
boom.
And he got to get that out.
You got to get all of that out.

1079
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.800
Don't sit there and be like,
oh,
I don't know how to say this,

1080
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:27.940
a Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
and turn it into a 45 minute thing.
Rip The bandaid odd.

1081
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.570
Just rip it off.
We need to talk.
I'm not happy.

1082
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:37.280
We need to break up.
Okay.

1083
01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:42.110
You go into the two minute offense.
Okay.
Get,

1084
01:06:42.111 --> 01:06:44.910
don't get out of bounds.
You keep the clock running.

1085
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:48.560
You want this game to be over?
No,
I dunno.

1086
01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:52.550
<v 4>Yeah,
that's what I would do.
That's what I would do.</v>

1087
01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.260
Just sit down and just say,
all right,
in eight seconds,

1088
01:06:57.530 --> 01:07:02.220
this relationship is going to be over.
Okay.
I'm on this side of,

1089
01:07:02.221 --> 01:07:04.220
of the eight seconds.
All I do.

1090
01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.700
How long does it take to say that I'm a timer right now.
All right.

1091
01:07:07.701 --> 01:07:08.534
We need to talk.

1092
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:10.723
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1093
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:14.380
<v 4>I'm not happy.
We need to break up.</v>

1094
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.120
I just did that and like five seconds

1095
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.930
and then she'd go,
well,
what if we blah blah,
blah.

1096
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.930
Now I've made the decision we need to break up.
It just,

1097
01:07:24.931 --> 01:07:27.300
it's just not working for me.
I don't love you the way I used to love you.

1098
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:29.910
That's it.
What can I say about it?
They get mad.
They can cry,

1099
01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:33.420
they can do all that shit.
But the thing is,
as you conveyed it and you're out,

1100
01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:39.400
where am I going to live?
I don't know.
We'll figure that out.

1101
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.340
I get sets.
The next thing we need to figure out.

1102
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.970
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1103
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:45.290
<v 4>Yeah.
Well it's,
your life's going to suck after that,</v>

1104
01:07:45.291 --> 01:07:48.830
but it's never going to suck more than staying in a fucking relationship.

1105
01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:53.270
You don't want to be in.
All right.
And that's one to grow on.
Go fuck yourselves.

1106
01:07:53.271 --> 01:07:54.410
I'll talk to you on Thursday.

1107
01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:01.880
<v 0>All right,
I'm back.
I guess my,
my recorder was almost filled up.</v>

1108
01:08:01.881 --> 01:08:05.780
Sorry about that sound.
We had to fucking attitude things together as always,

1109
01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:10.010
as always making my life difficult.
Um,
anyways.
Yeah.

1110
01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:14.510
So what are you doing over at this person's house?
She's dating somebody else.

1111
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:16.770
Anyway,
she goes,
he's a loser.

1112
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:21.840
No Job's still gets an allowance and expensive car that his mommy bought him.

1113
01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:24.150
Sits at home all day playing video games,

1114
01:08:24.151 --> 01:08:28.080
getting stone and treats people like he's above them.
She knows I hate him.

1115
01:08:28.081 --> 01:08:32.580
And I openly mock him,
um,
in front of our friends,

1116
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.070
her and even him,
uh,

1117
01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:40.130
like he got are this really generic but expensive looking hard shape necklace.

1118
01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.110
Um,
when she showed it to everyone,
I looked at him and said loudly,
wow,

1119
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:51.260
must've costs your mom quite a big whatever that means.

1120
01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.250
As you can imagine,
he tries to avoid me.
Yeah,
well,
you're being a fucking cunt.

1121
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:58.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1122
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.890
<v 0>Uh,
we share the same friends and they hate him and like me,</v>

1123
01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.940
but mind you,
I'm no prize either.
I'm trying to get a job.

1124
01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:09.880
Unlike him out Jesus,
you don't even have a fucking job.

1125
01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.860
And then saving up for a car.

1126
01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:17.560
So our choices are two guys who don't have a job and she has a rich mom.
Well,

1127
01:09:17.561 --> 01:09:21.700
there you go.
I tend to be nice,
a nice guy,

1128
01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:26.690
but can at times piss people off with my jokes and even be a Dick with my joke.

1129
01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:28.930
She sound like you've been a deck.
I'm not saying you are,

1130
01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:30.250
but you're being a dick to this guy.

1131
01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:35.500
He's at least three inches taller than me and handsomer better looking,

1132
01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:36.490
I guess.

1133
01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:41.360
He's got this great smile that makes me want to fuck him up for sure.

1134
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.440
Well that makes me want to fuck it up for him.

1135
01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:51.010
But recently I've started to turn my life around,
quit beer,
porn and drugs.

1136
01:09:51.011 --> 01:09:55.360
My grades are going up,
applying for college,
working out a lot,

1137
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:59.290
but all this in hopes of catching her ride.
Like I said,

1138
01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:01.780
she's my best friend and as a boyfriend,

1139
01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.730
so I really don't know how to handle this.

1140
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:08.380
Any help from you or Neil would be greatly appreciated.
Uh,
yeah dude.
Um,

1141
01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.880
I would start fishing in a different watering hole.
All right.

1142
01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:14.800
You know,

1143
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.800
for you to sit there and stand there and be a con to her boyfriend talking about

1144
01:10:20.591 --> 01:10:23.950
a boyfriend and you're going over that for over a fucking house.

1145
01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.493
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1146
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.260
<v 0>It sounds to me like you're,
you're,
you're less,</v>

1147
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.740
Chris rock says you're in the friend zone.
So what you need,

1148
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:40.610
what you need is you need some time away from her.
All right?

1149
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.480
Move on with your fucking life.
Keep working out.
Get your shit going.

1150
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.630
And who knows?
You might just meet somebody else.

1151
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.740
And then eventually when she dumps this loser,
she comes around and sees you.

1152
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:54.960
She'll be,
oh my God,
look at you.
You're going to college.
You look,
Greg,

1153
01:10:54.961 --> 01:10:58.850
you've been working out,
you know,
watch porn.
Who knows?
Maybe it'll happen,

1154
01:10:58.851 --> 01:11:00.740
but I can tell you,
it's definitely not going to happen.

1155
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.600
If you could just going to be your friend,

1156
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:07.760
they're making snide remarks about her,
her boyfriend.
Come on.

1157
01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:11.960
Do you gotta be better than that?
That's just coming off like a,
you know,

1158
01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:15.670
you're acting like a fucking,
you're acting like a Douche.

1159
01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:19.620
D and I don't know how else to put it.
Um,
that's not a strong move.

1160
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:23.810
All right?
Um,

1161
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.530
and you should have more going on in your life then the fucker be,
you know,

1162
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.930
used to have more self esteem than that.
All right?
Okay.

1163
01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:35.880
She wants to date this fucking guy.
Guess what?
It's her loss.
All right?

1164
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:40.950
So fuck it.
Get on with your life.
Keep working out and work out for yourself.

1165
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:45.900
Go to college for yourself.
Do all this shit.
Vsl.
Feel good about yourself.

1166
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.820
You start putting out more of a positive vibe as opposed to,
you know,

1167
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:55.650
hanging around her shitting on her current boyfriend.
I mean that's just like,

1168
01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.840
I don't know.
That's not a good look.
Okay.
I believe in you.
All right.

1169
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.350
Do what I just said or dope cause I don't have any professional training.

1170
01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:12.030
All right.
Dumping my girlfriend a Billy billboard brow

1171
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:16.470
I fuckin asshole.
That's another good one.

1172
01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.700
Recent Fandi a podcast stand up and all that jazz.
Anyways,

1173
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:26.160
I'm a 24 year old dude and I've been dating and living with my girl for almost

1174
01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:28.380
four years now and I finally had enough.

1175
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.100
She's a real Downer and talk shit about people including your friends.

1176
01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:34.230
Like it's an Olympic sport now.

1177
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:38.160
The problem is she lost a job a month ago on account of her shit talking.

1178
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:42.210
It hasn't exactly been going out and looking for a new one because she's anxious

1179
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:45.630
or whatever.
Leaving me to pick up her end of the bills.

1180
01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.320
She didn't have any savings because she had picked up the habit of going out and

1181
01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:53.250
drinking every night.
I honestly wouldn't have a problem,
uh,

1182
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.570
just up and leaving.

1183
01:12:55.110 --> 01:13:00.110
But the apartment is a stone's throw from the beach and my other roommate and I

1184
01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:01.620
really don't want to leave

1185
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:08.130
the fucking decisions people make too.
I needed the beach.
Uh,

1186
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.890
the other roommate is my best friend.
Okay.

1187
01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:14.550
She's got a lot of books and shit and the bed is hers.

1188
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:19.290
So when be a little,
so would be a little difficult to do.

1189
01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:22.440
The old put all her stuff in a box trick.
Uh,

1190
01:13:22.490 --> 01:13:26.520
deep down I do still have love for her.

1191
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.100
So the idea of kicking her out hurts my heart,

1192
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:32.070
but I just can't deal with the endless drama and unhappiness.

1193
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.080
We'd love to hear what your advice on the podcast and as always go fuck

1194
01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:37.741
yourself.
Yeah.

1195
01:13:37.741 --> 01:13:42.741
The more the relationship has run its course and you need to go your separate

1196
01:13:44.281 --> 01:13:48.810
ways.
And sometimes when that happens,
you know,
somebody,
yeah,
somebody gets hurt.

1197
01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:50.043
All right?

1198
01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:53.910
But you're not doing her any favors if you don't want her to be with you and you

1199
01:13:53.911 --> 01:13:58.860
just,
you just wasting her and your time.
So,
uh,

1200
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:01.553
you know,

1201
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:07.350
this is why you don't fucking live with somebody unless you know you're going to

1202
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:11.750
marry him.
I don't,
I don't know.
I don't know if
you,
yeah,
boy.

1203
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:14.900
Uh,
so what do you do?

1204
01:14:14.901 --> 01:14:18.080
Break up with her and then tell him to move out all at the same time or are

1205
01:14:18.081 --> 01:14:19.700
those two separate conversations?

1206
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.033
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1207
01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:22.870
<v 0>I just break up with her</v>

1208
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:26.860
and then let her bring up where am I going to live.

1209
01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1210
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.080
<v 0>And I'd be like,
well,
I don't know.
I mean the coastline is pretty long,</v>

1211
01:14:31.081 --> 01:14:34.380
so I'm sure there's another beach front apartment you can begin.

1212
01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.000
I'm assuming your name's on the lease.
Usually when there's a breakup,

1213
01:14:39.001 --> 01:14:41.010
the guy has to leave and leave half his shit.

1214
01:14:41.011 --> 01:14:44.630
So it seems like you were in a decent position here.
Uh,

1215
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:48.180
who wants a negative drunk without a job?
I don't think you want,

1216
01:14:48.181 --> 01:14:50.910
that doesn't sound like you want it.
Um,

1217
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:54.600
and I think the love you have for her was who she used to be or who you thought

1218
01:14:54.601 --> 01:14:56.520
she was.
So

1219
01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:57.870
<v 2>okay.</v>

1220
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:59.870
<v 0>That neither of those are happening right now.</v>

1221
01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:04.160
So it's time for you to tell her to hit the bricks.
Happy new year,
sweetheart.

1222
01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.220
<v 4>Beat it.
You can't say it like that.</v>

1223
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:09.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1224
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.760
<v 0>I just tell her,
look,
we need to talk and sit down.
She could be,</v>

1225
01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:14.910
what's the problem?
What's the problem?

1226
01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:18.680
Me and you just got to fight through that fucking horrible feeling.

1227
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:21.420
There's nothing worse.

1228
01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:25.890
The only worse than a woman crying is when she's about to cry because you still

1229
01:15:25.891 --> 01:15:28.980
have hope that she's not going to cry.
So you're on pins and needles.

1230
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.520
Once she's crying,
you're like,
fuck,
this sucks.

1231
01:15:32.521 --> 01:15:36.930
But you kind of know what's going to happen.
Um,
yeah.

1232
01:15:36.931 --> 01:15:41.280
You just got to sit her down and just say,
listen,
um,
I'm not happy.

1233
01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.370
This isn't working for me anymore and

1234
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:48.350
<v 2>okay,</v>

1235
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:52.880
<v 0>we need to break up.
All right?
Just like that.
Boom,</v>

1236
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:58.100
boom,
boom.
And he got to get that out.
You got to get all of that out.

1237
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.800
Don't sit there and be like,
well,
I don't know how to say this.

1238
01:16:03.801 --> 01:16:07.940
A Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
and turn it into a 45 minute thing.
Rip The bandaid odd.

1239
01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.540
Just rip it off.
We need to talk.
I'm not happy.

1240
01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.280
We need to break up.
Okay.

1241
01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:22.110
You're going into the two minute offense.
Okay.
Get,

1242
01:16:22.111 --> 01:16:24.910
don't get out of bounds.
You keep the clock running.

1243
01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:28.480
You want this game to be over?
No,
I dunno.

1244
01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.560
<v 4>Yeah,
that's what I would do.
That's what I would do.</v>

1245
01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:37.270
Just sit down and just say,
all right,
in eight seconds,

1246
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:42.150
this relationship is going to be over.
Okay.
I'm on this side of,

1247
01:16:42.151 --> 01:16:44.210
of the eight seconds.
All I do.

1248
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:47.680
How long does it take to say that I'm a timer right now.
All right,

1249
01:16:47.681 --> 01:16:48.514
we need to talk.

1250
01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:50.633
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1251
01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:54.380
<v 4>I'm not happy.
We need to break up.</v>

1252
01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.120
I just did that and like five seconds

1253
01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:01.930
and then she goes,
what if we blah,
blah,
blah.

1254
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.920
Now I've made the decision we need to break up.
It's just,

1255
01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:07.300
it's just not working for me.
I don't love you the way I used to love you.

1256
01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.920
That's it.
What can I say about,
they get mad.
They can cry.

1257
01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:13.430
They can do all that shit,
but the thing is is you conveyed it and you're out.

1258
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:19.420
Where am I going to live?
I don't know.
We'll figure that out.

1259
01:17:19.421 --> 01:17:23.600
I guess that's the next thing we need to figure out
and well,

1260
01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:25.310
it's your life's going to suck after that,

1261
01:17:25.311 --> 01:17:28.820
but it's never going to suck more than staying in a fucking relationship.
