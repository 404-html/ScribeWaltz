00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.333
Okay.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.430
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.</v>

3
00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:05.890
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:09.340
February 1st,

5
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.440
2016 what's going on?
There you go.

6
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:16.441
The first month of the year is out of the way in all Billy booze bag has been

7
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:21.950
doing really well.
All right.
Last time I got hammered.

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.280
Last time I got hammered was a the last date versus he was out here visiting me

9
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:28.510
whatever fucking day that was.

10
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:33.511
It was like the second or 3rd of January.

11
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.770
And um,

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.590
I didn't drink for the rest of the month other than the fact I had eight beers

13
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:40.360
leftover from the rose bowl.

14
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:44.680
So I just drank like one a day for eight straight days.
Um,

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.760
always wanting a second,
forget about a third in a ninth fear.
But I,
uh,

16
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.980
just,
I just had one that was it self,

17
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.470
it's not bad for me.
You know,

18
00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:00.040
I went like three weeks without drinking and eight straight days only had one

19
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:03.100
beer.
And then yesterday I didn't have any beer in the fridge.

20
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.140
I might have a Guinness left,
but I didn't drink it.
So,
uh,

21
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.330
you know,
we were out here.
What was Sunday?

22
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:13.270
It was fucking raining to beat the band.

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.040
Is that the fucking expression?
The play,
the band?

24
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:21.470
I even know what it was fucking porn out here for like legitimately the almost

25
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.470
the entire day.
Um,
which is great.

26
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.690
We could probably use about 90 more of those days,

27
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:30.090
but that was good that that was happening.
So,
um,

28
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.990
I just fucking stayed home.
Didn't do shit.

29
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.590
Last time I did Joe Rogan's podcast,

30
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.830
he gave me some elk meat that he had a,
he fucking killed an elk.

31
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:46.160
He murdered it premeditated.
The man got in his car and said,

32
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:48.260
I'm going to kill a fucking out,
but he didn't know which one,

33
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.780
so we can only get them on second degree murder.

34
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:54.170
And I became an accessory to the murder when I agreed to take some of the

35
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:59.120
carcass office heads.
Uh,
no,
he just gave me these two like giant,

36
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.820
like softball sized things,
the elk,

37
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.600
and they'd been sitting in my freezer.
So a,

38
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:10.340
I heard the meat's really lean and that it could be a little gamey.

39
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.940
So I just looked up some recipes and there was something there for like elk,

40
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:16.970
Chile and uh,
so I,
uh,

41
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.710
I made that yesterday and uh,
and it was fucking delicious.

42
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.880
But of course the lovely Nia goes out there and be like,
is this done?

43
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.920
This doesn't look done,
this doesn't,

44
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.360
I guess I'm just not used to Chile with this like consistency.

45
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.020
This smug looks more like a stew because there wasn't any tomato paste in the

46
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:39.410
recipe.
It was still delicious.
It was definitely a little more watery.

47
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.580
So she had to go out and go fuck with the whole thing and I'm eating the one

48
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:46.760
that I made and I'm enjoying it.
She just keeps it light in the other room,

49
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:51.050
just kept going,
like know,
I just think I do play for thought or whatever,

50
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.650
then fine.
I was just like,
will you shut up?
It's fine.

51
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.590
Fucking time.
I go out in the kitchen,

52
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:01.090
she fucking nitpicks whatever the hell it is that I'm making,

53
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.690
it's fucking unbelievable.
She makes something,
I eat it.
How was it adds good.

54
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.220
Go out there and go to the fucking spice rack.
You know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,

55
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.390
it's rude,
it's rude.
So we got into it,

56
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.610
you know,
as we always do,
right.
Get into it a little bit.
Then she laughs,

57
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:19.750
tell me to go fuck myself.

58
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.380
And then she gave me her virtue with the tomato paste and you know,
I say,

59
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.130
Oh yeah,
I see what you're saying.
I like it.
You know,
that,

60
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
guess what I really felt.
I felt the first one tasted better.

61
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.900
She thinking that all up with this fucking tomato paste and they made it like

62
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:39.040
sweeter and,
uh,
you know,
did it to the whole fucking pot.
So,

63
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.730
you know,
we had a giant pot of it,
so I was like,
well,

64
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.760
I can handle what the fuck she did to it.
If it's just mine,

65
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.980
I got to eat the whole pot.
So I just rolled with it.

66
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.250
Just one of those times you just sit quietly and you nod.
Yeah.
Okay.

67
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.910
That's what you did over there.
All right,
I'll approve that.
You know.

68
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.610
Anyway,
um,
underrated elk.
Me.

69
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.800
<v 0>Okay.</v>

70
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.900
<v 1>Got It.
Thrown out there.
Just fucking delicious.
So then we fucking sitting there.</v>

71
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.480
I take my dog out.
There's a little a break in the um,

72
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.860
<v 0>yeah.</v>

73
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.650
<v 1>And the wind,
the weather.
So I take my dog around the block and uh,</v>

74
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.410
Blahblahblahblahblah and I come back in and he is like,
Hey,
you know what?

75
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.550
Why don't you want to have a pot cookie?
And I was like,
no,
I don't.

76
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.420
I got the podcast to do,
I got some bills,
mail and shit I have to do.
She's like,

77
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.970
come on,
it's fucking raining.
We're not going anywhere.

78
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.670
This is a perfect day to have a pot coke.
He's like,
I don't like,

79
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:37.030
that shit gets me too fucked up.
I feel like I'm hallucinating.

80
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.420
I don't want to do it.
And she goes,
no,
these are really mild.

81
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.830
These are really mild.

82
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.990
I know everybody out to fucking consumes those things right now is laughing

83
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.950
though.
They really mild so guy,
fine.
So I fucking eat this thing

84
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.880
right.
And it comes on really slow.
It's mellow.

85
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:58.320
And on my card I can deal with this,

86
00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:02.580
just sort of just be chilling out and be relaxed and then all of a sudden just

87
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:07.010
fucking to the Moon Alice.
Right.
It's like fucking tripping.

88
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.830
Not like literally,
but it was just like,
you know,

89
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.060
I closed my eyes and my feet would feel like they would nine miles away from me,

90
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.330
you know?
And uh,
that was it.

91
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.160
I took it in the afternoon like around four o'clock by five o'clock.
That was it.

92
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.120
The day was over.
So now here I am,
I've got a bunch of shit to do it.

93
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:32.750
I'm trying to cram this crap and then I really don't,
I don't like it.
Um,

94
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.630
potheads idea of what mild is,
is not,
you know,

95
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:39.590
now I'm sure I'm going to get a bunch of fucking,

96
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.180
get a bunch of fucking emails from people going like this.

97
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:50.160
You want this sativa Fuckin a Asian and fused strain,

98
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:53.760
a weed man.
I just don't give a fuck.
All right.

99
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.540
I mean,
I was like,
just,
I was TV just dying,

100
00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:00.640
laughing at everything that fucking came on there.

101
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.450
My wife made some cornbread with the Chili and I started doing like a cornbread

102
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.460
commercial,
you know,
hey guys,
what's better than a,
than a bowl of Chili.

103
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.560
That's right.
A nice piece of cornbread high.
Do you know me of sure.

104
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:18.100
We all do.
I was just doing that shit and I was the funniest shit ever to me.

105
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:20.830
And they was looking at me like,
what the Fuck's wrong with you?
And I'm like,

106
00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:23.380
what do you mean what's wrong with me?
You fucking drugged me.

107
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.980
I swear to God.
You know what I think it was.

108
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.660
I think the horror of me being around for 24 hours with that,

109
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:36.100
whether she got like cabin fever and she literally dragged me because she was

110
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:37.390
able to handle it fine,

111
00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:41.050
which is making me think she took less and she was just sitting there watching

112
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:44.200
TV and I'm saying all this shit that's making me laugh.

113
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:46.180
And she's just sitting there totally quiet.
I like,

114
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.510
I go my Bob and over here she was just like,
no,
no,
no.
I hear what you say.

115
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:54.040
And I'm just watching the show and I like,
how are you that fucking

116
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.780
like,
I'm still a little fucked up right now at 24 hours later.

117
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.603
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

118
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.740
<v 1>So anyways,
that's why I like alcohol.
It's slowly comes on.</v>

119
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:10.610
I know where it's going.
It wasn't like he grabbed a beer and you're this,

120
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:14.300
so I wonder what this does.
What's the end now that this,

121
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.810
this is a mellow drunk and then all of a sudden you get like fucking 20 times

122
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:19.750
drunker than you wanted it to be.
I mean,
that can start,

123
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.470
that can happen I guess with hard stuff.

124
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.493
<v 0>MMM,</v>

125
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.271
<v 1>I did.
I don't know.</v>

126
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:28.150
I just feel like the amount of fucking edibles you have to have to start to

127
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:31.150
understand what they do.
It,
it's just not fucking worth it.
So,
uh,

128
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.300
that was my one pot cookie for the year.
But anyways,

129
00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:38.350
I haven't had a cigar since the eighth.
Um,
so I did it.

130
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.280
I'm trying to be too cigar a month guy.
And I did it in January.

131
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:46.560
I had one at the rose bowl and I had one on the eighth and then a,

132
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.130
now I've got a whole fucking month ahead of me.

133
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:51.300
So rather than smoking on the first,
you know,

134
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.850
I'm just going to fucking chill here for like a week to 10 days.

135
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:57.430
And then I'd have to figure,
I got to,
I could smoke.

136
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.060
Really just taking you through my whole fucking a bad habit.
A schedule,

137
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.610
their own.
I um,
I was speaking to cookies by the way.

138
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.480
I bought two boxes of girl scout cookies from this lay,

139
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.983
<v 0>you know,</v>

140
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.020
<v 1>it's never the girl scout anymore knocking on the door.
Thank God.</v>

141
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.250
Thank God with all the,
the uh,
to catch a predator.

142
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.440
They probably got sick of getting the door fucking slammed in their face.

143
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.980
Dig Dog.
He opened the door.
Hi,
I'm selling girls.

144
00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:28.910
Got The door,

145
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.650
fucking yelling at your dog.
You saw nothing happened.
So anyways,
um,

146
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.580
now that just sorta sold by adults as far as I know.

147
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:42.060
So I got two boxes of these fucking things and um,

148
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.430
I just finally realized the amount of time that I've always felt like the girl

149
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:51.940
scouts made the cookies because they would call girl scout cookies.

150
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:55.090
And just somewhere maybe in the middle of this country,

151
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.760
somewhere around Fort Knox,
like the,
uh,
the United League of,

152
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.730
of American dos girl scouts has their headquarters and they just had these giant

153
00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:09.650
tubs where they just stirred up cookie batter once a year and they got him out.

154
00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:10.484
And,
um,

155
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.313
<v 0>okay.</v>

156
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.590
<v 1>After finally thinking about it and looking at the professional packaging,
um,
um,</v>

157
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.520
<v 0>yeah,</v>

158
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.730
<v 1>I'm going to go out on a limb here and I want to say,
I don't think,</v>

159
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.790
I don't think any girl scout's make any of those fucking cookies.

160
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.000
I think they fucking outsource it,
right?

161
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.090
<v 1>It's probably made by children.
Central America.</v>

163
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

164
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.070
<v 1>They sit there crying,
how hard they have to work,</v>

165
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.590
knowing they're never going to get a bite,
you know?

166
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.760
And then one of them actually steals a cookie and there's some psychotic

167
00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:46.690
disciplinary action that's taken.
Let's Google this shit,
Huh?
Shall We?

168
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.110
This is like the new segment now.
They'll just,
you know,
back in the day,

169
00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:52.240
she's just talk now.
I'm actually going to look it up here.

170
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.850
Who makes girl scout cookies?

171
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.153
<v 0>Okay.</v>

172
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.560
<v 1>All right,
girl scout cookies.
All right.</v>

173
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.150
Girl scout cookies or cookies sold by girl scouts.
I'll thank you.
Thank you.

174
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:14.151
Wikipedia girl scouts of the USA or a GS USA as one of its major fundraisers for

175
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:20.160
local scouts units,
members of the girl scouts of America,

176
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:25.190
but selling cookies since 1917 girls who participate can earn prizes for their

177
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:30.390
effort.
Fuck you.
That's my name.
Alec Baldwin comes in and screams at him.

178
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.710
All right.

179
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.710
The first cookies sales was by as scouting union missile,

180
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.890
the missile tow troop in Oklahoma and December,

181
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.660
1917 at their local high school in 1922 girl Scout magazine,
the American girls,

182
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.220
the American girls suggested cookie sales as a fundraiser,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

183
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:52.770
blah.
From 33 to 35 crunchy,
wise,

184
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:57.060
organized cookie sales grew with troops in Philadelphia in New York City using

185
00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:00.450
the cookie selling model,
so they're cooking their own ones.

186
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:01.960
<v 0>Okay.</v>

187
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.330
<v 1>World War Two they sold calendars.</v>

188
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:05.570
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.550
<v 1>In 1990 the National Council limited the bakery's providing cookies to Jess,</v>

190
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.270
ABC bakeries,
a division of inner Interbake foods.

191
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.490
Oh wait,
I skipped over something.

192
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:20.960
In 1950 [inaudible] more cookie recipes were added short breads,

193
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.590
peanut butter sandwich,
and thin mints.
The classic,

194
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.430
it's like the Beatles,
Zeppelin,
and the who of cookies.

195
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.700
Six types of cookies were being sold nationwide.

196
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:32.920
<v 0>Okay,</v>

197
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.280
<v 1>great.
A cookie sale due to the baby boom generation,
they needed more.</v>

198
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.880
The Samoa was added and 75.
All right,
whatever.

199
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.040
So ABC bakers was making in the 1990s and little Brownie Baker's little Prouty

200
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.010
Baker's a division of the key book company.
In 1998,

201
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:53.011
cookie sale awards were instituted with the 2005 trans fat controversy.

202
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.150
The girl scouts moved to make the cookies healthier and provide nutritional

203
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.000
information on the box.
In 2009,

204
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:06.001
the number of thin mints Dosey Dose and Tag Tag alongs and each box was reduced.

205
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.840
Why in the lemon chalet creams became smaller because of the increasing cost of

206
00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:18.600
ingredients and transportation.
All right?
So the,
the,
there,

207
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.310
they tried to make it with less,
uh,
less trans fats.

208
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.350
Here's 10 weird girl scout cookie facts and then I'll get off this fucking

209
00:12:27.351 --> 00:12:30.070
subject eyes dry mouth from that fucking cookie last night.

210
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

211
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.700
<v 1>Hey,
when they legalize</v>

212
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.283
<v 0>like</v>

213
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.460
<v 1>pot at a federal level,</v>

214
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:39.400
do you think that they'll actually have girl scout like pot cookies?

215
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.520
You know Jesus Christ.
That'll be a field day.
What's happening to this country?

216
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.060
I'm a it salad.
Drugs.
All right.
Number one.

217
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.120
These cookies are older than your grandmother.
That's not weird.

218
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:53.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

219
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.740
<v 1>Sound weird to,
you can make the original recipe at home.</v>

220
00:12:57.741 --> 00:13:01.190
You can make the original recipe of everything at home.
If you know the recipe.

221
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.770
Do you feel like taking a trip back in time and faking some boring stuff?
Oh,

222
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:10.170
this must be one of these hipsters sites where they're over everything,

223
00:13:10.171 --> 00:13:11.820
including making fucking cookies.

224
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.020
You can try the authentic or they actually liked making the cookies,

225
00:13:16.021 --> 00:13:18.000
but they're anticipating being insulted.

226
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.430
So what they do is they make fun of themselves first.

227
00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:24.090
So you can't authentic original girl scout cookie recipe.

228
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.670
It's not in the respite recipe,

229
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:31.350
but they taste better if you dress up as a girl scout when you make them all.

230
00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:35.310
That's a little internet joke.
Only two companies make the cookies.

231
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.950
Honey booboo is banned from selling them.

232
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.650
Thin mints are aren't just delicious.
They're mandatory.

233
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.850
I don't know what that means.

234
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.840
There is a cookie queen and she's a master sales woman.

235
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.043
<v 0>Okay.</v>

236
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.690
<v 1>Oh,
there's a non sanctioned girl scout cookies.
Weed strain.
Of course.</v>

237
00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.560
Girl scout cookies used to cost less than a quarter.

238
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.890
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

239
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.000
<v 1>everything costs less.</v>

240
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.190
<v 0>Okay.</v>

241
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.730
<v 1>There was a cookie shortage during World War Two.
Of course.</v>

242
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.540
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

243
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.370
<v 1>Not every cookie made the grade.</v>

244
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.070
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

245
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.960
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
That was disappointing.
All right.</v>

246
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:17.740
Can I apologize Phil wasting the last fucking 15 minutes you life talking about

247
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:20.170
girl scout cookies.
Um,

248
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.810
did anybody watched the NHL?

249
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:26.860
All Star Gay fucking three on three hockey dude.

250
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.460
It was actually pretty entertaining but not quite as exciting as I thought it

251
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:32.980
was going to be because no one was going to take the body dude.

252
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.660
But it was still cool and obviously seeing John Scott score a couple of goals,

253
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.760
it's fucking hilarious at the NHL.

254
00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:43.450
Didn't want him in there after all the money that they've made on fighting and

255
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:46.270
all the shit that of goon goes through,
you know,

256
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:50.380
the fact that the fans liked him enough to elect him into the game.
Right.

257
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.970
Daddy gets fucking traded.

258
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:56.030
Sit down to the midas and they told them not to show up.

259
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.020
Then he blogged about it like a seventh grade check and everybody went,
Dude,

260
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.870
what the fuck?
And then he was there and then he scored two goals.

261
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.880
It was like a Hollywood fucking movie.
Hey,
any non hockey fans?

262
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:09.920
Did you actually sit down and watch the All Star game?

263
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:13.940
It's everything that you would have liked a zillion fucking goals.
No fighting,

264
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.560
nothing physical people smiling after running into one another.

265
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.930
Was it dumbed down enough for you?
They're fucking who?
Peds.
Um,

266
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.150
I actually only watched the first period.
It's,

267
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.910
it appeared like the first period was only like 10 minutes long.

268
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.470
Is that true or was I under the influence of a plot cookie?
Um,

269
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.890
but anyways,
oh,
exciting news here.
Exciting news for me.
Um,

270
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.070
I'm actually doing a Gig in Cheyenne,
Wyoming now,

271
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:46.040
Wyoming is the last state that will fucking,

272
00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:50.270
Billy red face has never performed in.
And at this point,
um,

273
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.640
I will have performed in all fucking 50 states.
And uh,

274
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.610
that being the fact that,
I don't know,
I have a little that OCD right?

275
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.260
Is that what it is?
No,
I don't know what it is.
I just like,
you know,

276
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.750
at first I was like,
you know what?
I'm going to go to every baseball stadium.

277
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.340
Then it became immediately goes,

278
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.910
I'm going to go to every fucking stadium that exists,
you know?

279
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.060
So if I start doing standup and then it becomes,
oh,
I did,
I've done three states.

280
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:17.180
It immediately I have to do every state and then it becomes a,

281
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.280
I have to do every continent,
you know,

282
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.990
except for like Antarctica or like places that don't want me.
Right.

283
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.390
But anyways,
I'm going to be a,
I'm going to be in Cheyenne,
Wyoming.

284
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.510
I'm going a bit,
first of all,
I'm going to be in Denver,

285
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.060
rocky mountain high.
And please don't bring me any fucking pot cookies.

286
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.770
All right.
I don't enjoy the,
I,
I don't,
I okay.
I just,

287
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:47.210
it's too much on the 12th and 13th I believe the,
uh,

288
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.940
12th and 13th is Wyoming and Denver,
Denver,
Wyoming,
I don't know which one.

289
00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:54.830
And then the 14th is Valentine's Day.

290
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:59.690
And that's of course when a young people go out because they're not smart enough

291
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:04.680
to realize that,
uh,
that you can say,
I love you on any day of the year.
You know,

292
00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:06.920
what's a great day to go out?
Go out on like the 17th

293
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.690
or the 16th to the 19th or the 21st.
Don't go out right before,

294
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:18.590
go out after brought after I say this every fucking year.
You know,

295
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.633
look at this.

296
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.230
The Superbowl this year is on the seventh and the fucking Valentine stays on the

297
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:28.340
14th.
Now those are two absolutely absolute shit show days.

298
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.630
Now obviously if your own fucking football team is playing in the Superbowl,

299
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.980
you know,
you're this,
you're going to want to watch it with a couple other fence,

300
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.280
right?
However,
that doesn't mean that you're going to,

301
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.600
you go to one of those shit show fucking Superbowl party.
So like I said,

302
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:48.830
as always,
take the fucking game.
Let it go for a good 90.

303
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.450
Then you come in,
you sit down,
you blow through all the commercials,

304
00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:57.380
you blow through the fucking halftime show.
Fast forward to all of that shit.

305
00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:01.980
And then,
uh,
when the game really starts getting down to it,
you know,
you're,

306
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:05.060
you're caught right up.
You'll catch up and like the beginning of the,
uh,

307
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.350
the fourth quarter,
then he can just kind of watch it in real time.

308
00:18:09.351 --> 00:18:12.200
It's fucking perfect.
And you know,
blow your whole afternoon.

309
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.170
Oh fuck.
Sorry guys.
No more pot cookies for me.
Um,

310
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.490
and then the a and the 14th st thing,
just wait like two,
three days after

311
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.670
when he can get a fucking reservation.
Do,

312
00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:28.310
you can go to the restaurant you want to go to and they haven't jacked the

313
00:18:28.311 --> 00:18:31.280
prices up to the fucking roof.
Um,

314
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.230
and then you're done.
Right?
He's a good one,
right?

315
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.250
Because guys,
we usually don't get shit on Valentine's Day.
So,
uh,

316
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.610
I suggest don't get your wife shit either.

317
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.630
Just take her out to dinner and fucking leave it at that.
And if she's like,

318
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:50.730
I thought you were going to get me something else,
just be like,
well,

319
00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:55.350
did you get me something else?
And when she's like,
no,
you be okay.
Well,

320
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:58.170
I paid for dinner.
That's it.

321
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.820
And that guarantees that you'll be in a fucking awful fight on Valentine's Day.

322
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:06.210
How do you like that?
See what I'm steering steering you towards?

323
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.600
Um,
for the life of me,

324
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:14.601
Bill burr coming to Cheyenne Civic Center to 11 the fuck are you talking about?

325
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.000
I can't be right.
Bill Burr will perform it.

326
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:28.650
The Cheyenne Civic Center in Cheyenne,
Wyoming on Thursday,
February 11th.

327
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:32.670
All right,
so then on the 12th I must be a Denver.
Is that right?

328
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.320
Jesus Christ.
Bill,
how do you have,

329
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.140
why don't you fucking know your own goddamn schedule?
DENVER,

330
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:45.150
I had to go skiing when I'm out there.
You know,
I skied once every 10 years.

331
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.080
I really should take a lesson cause that,
that is just the blow.
You fuck yes.

332
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.560
The 12th all right,
so the 11th Thursday,

333
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.270
I'm in Wyoming in February 12th I'm in Denver.
Ah,

334
00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.780
that's how it is.
Very nice.
So there you go.

335
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:05.070
The Cheyenne Civic Center,
you know,
they always have fucking rodeos and shit.

336
00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:09.720
They're right.
What goes on there,
Toby?
Keith,
Cheyenne,

337
00:20:09.721 --> 00:20:14.721
civic center civic set up to be like some old ABA building

338
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.440
damages.
Jesus Christ.

339
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.490
Look at Cheyenne.
This looks like a fucking opera plays there.
An opera bill,

340
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.790
an orchestra.
Um,
the shade

341
00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.790
go to Cheyenne,
Wyoming.

342
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.060
What are some of the great things that happened in Wyoming over the years?
Huh?

343
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.380
Only thing you always hear is bad stuff isn't that place with a will.

344
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:50.250
They tied that kid cause he was gay to the fence until he died.

345
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.640
This isn't good.
They don't have any sports tapes.

346
00:20:53.641 --> 00:20:57.370
The fuck am I going to Wyoming for Wyoming?

347
00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.960
This is where like Ted Turner can ride his horse all over the place and be like,

348
00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:01.920
I own that.

349
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.060
I own that to get off of there.

350
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

351
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.020
<v 1>Or I'll take you out of Yardi,
your basic cable package.</v>

352
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.250
Take my fucking TV Outta here.
Um,

353
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.420
don't ever start any shit with Ted Turney and why?
Ohmic all right.

354
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

355
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.910
<v 1>Cause he's going to come and arrest you and then he's going to be the judge and</v>

356
00:21:23.911 --> 00:21:26.390
he's going to throw you a g on.
It's the whole fucking state.
Does he?

357
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.270
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

358
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.870
<v 1>I believe he does,
right?
I Dunno.
Anyways,</v>

359
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:35.920
let's get to the fucking reach here for this week.
Mobilly all over the place.

360
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

361
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.750
<v 1>All right.
What do we got here the first week?
Oh,
look who's back,</v>

362
00:21:41.751 --> 00:21:45.980
everybody.
Sherry's berries.
Uh,

363
00:21:45.981 --> 00:21:50.240
must be a clam day coming up.
Oh yes it is.
Valentine's Day is next week.

364
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.630
Finding the right gift can be tricky.
Uh,

365
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.770
tell a personal story relating to Valentine's Day.
Well,
you know,

366
00:21:57.771 --> 00:22:01.550
I think it's bullshit.
You know,
I always hated it.
What?
I was fucking younger.

367
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.830
I think everything's a overpriced and everybody just sits,

368
00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:08.900
stay a look at around at everybody,
you know,

369
00:22:08.901 --> 00:22:13.820
and then somebody gets proposed to and they're like,
oh my God.
And then,
you know,

370
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.690
even if you've already proposed to the one year with this still kind of fucking

371
00:22:17.691 --> 00:22:20.220
jealous and sad,
you know,

372
00:22:20.221 --> 00:22:22.760
for then you just sit there splitting a dessert.

373
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.440
That's the part I hate the most.

374
00:22:25.441 --> 00:22:28.740
Just sitting there splitting dessert because that means I've wanted to leave for

375
00:22:28.741 --> 00:22:33.270
at least an hour and 10 minutes.
I just feel like you're distant tonight.

376
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.140
Um,
oh,
he's an example of the story.

377
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.420
Why you give Valentine's Day gifts,

378
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.910
getting the wrong gift to getting the right Gif.

379
00:22:41.911 --> 00:22:45.360
Horror stories of waiting until the last minute and et cetera.

380
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.550
I don't think you should get him a gift.

381
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:50.610
I don't think you should get them anything more than Sherry's berries.

382
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.080
The fuck are they getting you?

383
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.160
Where is the copy for what the lay is going to get the guy,

384
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.260
this is such a fucking bullshit.
This,
this,
this whole holidays.

385
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.980
Completely fucking sexist.
And I,
you know,
you'd like to hear more,

386
00:23:04.981 --> 00:23:09.720
a little chatter from the fucking feminist ladies there about this,
you know,

387
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.180
why are you taking me out?

388
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.660
Why don't I take you out every other year and then I get you a gift.

389
00:23:15.661 --> 00:23:20.520
Come on ladies.
Let's have an even playing field,
right?
All right.

390
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.160
You want to give something unique that she'll love,

391
00:23:23.161 --> 00:23:27.030
but you don't want to spend a zillion dollars.
You know,
you want to say,
Hey,

392
00:23:27.031 --> 00:23:29.220
I'm really like you.
You know,
I really like you,

393
00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:30.870
but I'm not quite in love with you yet,

394
00:23:30.871 --> 00:23:34.830
but I'd like to get you to continue fucking me.
What would be a perfect gift?

395
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.270
Sherry's berries,

396
00:23:36.271 --> 00:23:41.271
freshly dipped strawberries from Sherry's berries starting at only 1,999 it's

397
00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:47.420
over 40% savings.
That's less than a hookah,
and if you don't want,

398
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.040
if you really want hero status,
you can double the berries for just 10 bucks.

They fucking get yanked and then they throw them and they ripen on the truck.

They ripe.

What if there was a gift that said,
said it for you?
Jesus.
[inaudible] sexist.

424
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:32.090
This shit is yet to fucking dumb to say what you're thinking.

425
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.510
Why don't we handle it while with a bunch of Shit we ripped out of the ground?

426
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.330
Imagine a gift that was thoughtful,
easy,

427
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.590
and she'd love and that set your message perfectly.
All in one.

428
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.790
It's a beautiful flowers.
They're beautiful like you.

429
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.500
I call that a win on Valentine's Day.

430
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.100
Tell a personal story relating to Valentine's Day.
Well,

431
00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:56.930
I always thought it was fucking bullshit.

432
00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:59.480
I always thought it was a bullshit fucking holiday.
You know,

433
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:03.230
you pay way too much money and then halfway through some other woman gets

434
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:05.900
proposed to it.
Even if you're already proposed,
the young woman,

435
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.700
she's still look it over.
They're like,
oh,

436
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.190
you don't feel like I'm the fucking queen of the ball.

437
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.240
They really liked these personal stories.
Example,

438
00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:17.030
why you give Valentine's Day gifts,
getting the wrong gift.

439
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:18.890
Jesus has saint people write this shit.

Sherry's fucking berries.

456
00:27:27.921 --> 00:27:30.950
Well there's only one more here so I might as well plow through it.
No,
no,

457
00:27:30.951 --> 00:27:32.810
there's two more.
All right.
We'll split it up.

458
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.820
We'll split it up.
Uh,
you know,

459
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:41.030
I was actually debating watching the Superbowl by myself and doing a little bit

460
00:27:41.031 --> 00:27:44.630
of commentating during the game.
You guys seem to enjoy that.
Um,

461
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.890
maybe I'll do commentating during the shittiest most boring parts,

462
00:27:48.891 --> 00:27:53.870
but then I'd have to sit and watch it like whoever's opening and I know stings

463
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.760
playing the halftime show and as much as I want to go see him and,
and Vinny,

464
00:27:57.761 --> 00:27:59.480
Kali you,
it is on my bucket list.

465
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.790
Like that's not the right band for halftime at the Super Bowl.

466
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.103
Huh?

467
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

468
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:13.090
<v 1>Every breath you take every day move you make,</v>

469
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.240
he's going to have to go more uptempo shit.

470
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.210
What do you think stings going to play from his repertoire?

471
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:20.163
<v 0>Huh?</v>

472
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.980
<v 1>And thing off 10 summer tails.</v>

473
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.810
But that's not the queen of my heart.
No,

474
00:28:29.811 --> 00:28:34.040
that's not the shape of Maha.

475
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:38.850
I can't play that song
found out now,
but double,

476
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:42.080
double bounce.
[inaudible] and what's,

477
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.290
I was at Boon Doga Danco

478
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.290
fucking song was that then there was a song about the brothers,

479
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.320
the one that he was a coward.
None of that is going to play.
Well,

480
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.140
it probably plays synchronicity.

481
00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:57.970
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

482
00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.790
<v 1>right.
You had a football game that stadium rock.
Did you set that goal?</v>

483
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:02.863
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

484
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.020
<v 1>Right.
Bunch of old baby boomers.
Second along,
bunch of kids go.</v>

485
00:29:09.021 --> 00:29:13.650
And that's not dubstep.
Um,
they had,
dude,

486
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.110
I want to fast forward through all that shit.
Yeah.

487
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:19.380
I'm thinking about maybe commentating on some of that stuff.
I'll just do like,

488
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.100
uh,
maybe I'll just do like three minutes,
not the game,
you know,

489
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:26.950
cause I think it will get boring after awhile,
you know?
Um,

490
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.890
at least if I'm going to get bored of myself,

491
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:33.150
I would think that you guys would get bored.
No.
Um,
all right,

492
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.360
let's plow through here.
So I don't have any booze in the fridge,
so I'm just,

493
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:40.260
I guess the month of,
uh,
I sorta half ass committed to this.

494
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.180
Like not posing.

495
00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.020
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

496
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.970
<v 1>Is that a bad thing?
A fuck is the other,
oh,
there it is.
Sorry.</v>

497
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:54.280
Um,
talks about everything.
Pot cookie raining out here.
Shane.
Oh,

498
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:59.260
I haven't been on the fucking road and weeks,
so,
um,
I might be doing wink wink.

499
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.060
Oh,
I am doing a show this week.
That's right.

500
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:05.960
I'm doing the DDL Rag del Ray at the El Rey.
Oh,
JJ.

501
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:11.510
I'm a night of comedy and rock a Dean Del Ray's 50th birthday party.

502
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:17.770
He's going to have,
um,
you know,
he's going to have Joe Rogan,
crystal,
Leah,

503
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.730
myself.
Um,
I know there's a couple of other comics.

504
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.770
A Red Band is going to be down there and I want to say,

505
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.390
I want to say there's maybe one other comic.
And then after that,
uh,

506
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:37.430
Dee del Ray's gonna front a band that will include the likes of Rudy Sazo,

507
00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:42.780
Dave Cushner,
Dave Lombardo,
Tracie guns,

508
00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:44.010
Gilby Clarke,

509
00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.670
all these rock stars and he's going to sing the entire highway to hell album.

510
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.840
And uh,
oh Billy red faced might sit in for a song or two,

511
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.130
but it's going to be a great night.

512
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.360
You can get tickets@agoldenvoice.com.

513
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.620
And also,
um,
I might be doing a,
a,

514
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:06.260
a surprise show somewhere locally because I got to run my hours.

515
00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:09.950
So when I go to Cheyenne,
Wyoming or not get out there,

516
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.740
check out spread,

517
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.970
I want to make sure the thing that'd be on my game.

518
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.510
I don't want people in the crowd being like,
what the fuck,
man,

519
00:31:18.511 --> 00:31:23.511
you made us wait to be number 50 for that bull shit walking around.

520
00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:27.180
And they had John Denver fucking cheap coach.
Right.

521
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:32.270
Get the sheep lining rocky Matt and had Colorado bail.

522
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:38.430
We don't talk like that.
We'll talk like this.
That's all.
Wow.
All about.

523
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.310
I'm going to the Capitol Man.
Do they have open carry in Wyoming?
You know what,

524
00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:46.360
I made such a big deal about open carry in Texas and a,

525
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:49.230
it turns out that they've had it in Oklahoma for years and there hasn't been a

526
00:31:49.231 --> 00:31:53.340
fucking problem.
So,
um,
that's kind of a non story.

527
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.230
And then again,

528
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.490
I think that kind of adds to the touristy vibe of going to Texas and seeing

529
00:31:59.491 --> 00:32:03.630
people walking around with holsters.
You know,
maybe you can see,

530
00:32:03.631 --> 00:32:07.170
so you have somebody have a fucking shoot out over like a parking,
parking space,

531
00:32:07.171 --> 00:32:11.940
a duel right draw.
Uh,

532
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.560
yeah.
Worst case scenario,
just a bunch of people that I don't know die,

533
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.740
which is a considering with global warming and overpopulation.

534
00:32:19.741 --> 00:32:22.470
I think it's a good thing.
I think they should have open carry.
Uh,

535
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.760
they should have everywhere.
Everybody's strapped.

536
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.860
It would probably actually end up being safer when you think about it.

537
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.160
Cause I know like New York City for as much as everybody talks about how

538
00:32:35.161 --> 00:32:38.910
dangerous it was.
Uh,
I just found on the,
on the subways,

539
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.660
we're all of a sudden you were riding in the car would fucking everybody.

540
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.170
It's all mixed up there.

541
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:48.000
There was a certain level of heightened courtesy because you didn't want to have

542
00:32:48.001 --> 00:32:51.960
a fucking problem.
You know,
it's the subway is New York City.

543
00:32:51.961 --> 00:32:54.030
You could get mugged,
you could get the shit kicked daddy.

544
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.190
So people fucking minded that business.

545
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.310
So I would think if he had a whole state of everybody walking around with a gun

546
00:32:59.311 --> 00:33:03.720
on their hip,
you know,
somebody cuts you off in traffic,
you know,
Eh,
you know,

547
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.730
yeah.
I could yell,
you fucking Asshole boot up.
You start shooting at me.
Yeah.

548
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.970
It's okay.
Go ahead buddy.
I mean I have a gun too,
but you know what,

549
00:33:11.971 --> 00:33:16.890
if I miss and you don't by all means go in front of me,
you know,

550
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.580
like if somebody is being weird to you and you're at one of those ATM sits on

551
00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:23.700
the outside of a building.
Yeah.
It's a very nervous moment for you.

552
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.970
But if you're in your car and that same person cuts you off,
you're fuck you,

553
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.860
you fucking Dick a year.
You're all tough and your car,

554
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.610
which can lead to road rage.
Now if you know that that guy has a gun,

555
00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:37.460
he could just simply,
you know,

556
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.680
pointed out the side of his car and just shooting the general direction of your

557
00:33:40.681 --> 00:33:44.310
car.
You figure at the very least he's got to hit the radiator right.

558
00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:48.780
You have that steam coming up like in every fucking movie.
Just the good old boy.

559
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.673
Right?

560
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.910
He probably going to mind your fucking business.

561
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.700
Maybe that's the secret to ending all wars.

562
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.640
Everybody strapped and you have the gun out.

563
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:05.270
He just walk in and every time you just walk you just,

564
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:09.140
the guns already pointed at somebody.
How you doing?
I'm doing good.
How are you?

565
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.850
Fine.
That's great.
Yeah,
keep the conversation short and sweet.

566
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.250
I think I just solve all of our,
all of our problems,
right?

567
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:23.900
Everybody's strapped with a gloated gun out pointed at somebody's safety off.

568
00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:25.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

569
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.350
<v 1>Because you'd be more relaxed,
you know,
all they couldn't have safety off.</v>

570
00:34:29.351 --> 00:34:31.900
Cause then when people fell asleep,
you know,
it's like falling asleep.
I'll,

571
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:37.060
you know,
smoking,
you can let your bed on fire,
you might squeeze off around,

572
00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.220
which doesn't even make sense,
right?

573
00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:42.670
Cause you've got to put pressure on it once you have in one of those dreams,

574
00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:43.990
you know?
Yeah.

575
00:34:43.991 --> 00:34:46.750
But one of those dreams where you're falling or somebody just gives you a leg

576
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:49.630
sweep,
sweep she leg for whatever reason,

577
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.500
and you have to get fucking tense up.
Maybe then,

578
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.400
then you shoot yourself in the foot.
I bet podiatrist would be off the bet.

579
00:34:57.401 --> 00:35:01.870
They're all for open carry,
you know the foot doctors.

580
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.370
All right,
you want me to do some reads for this week here?
Let's get into it.

581
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:07.760
Uh,

582
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.160
where are we?
Come on bill.
For God's sakes.

583
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.740
I was on the right one to begin with.

584
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.470
Oh Hey.
By the way,
does anybody know?
Like when I'll fucking,
for whatever reason,

585
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:28.890
you hit download an album off of iTunes and then for whatever reason it just

586
00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:33.210
sort of disappears off of your phone and then fucking reappears because you

587
00:35:33.211 --> 00:35:37.540
haven't hooked it up to the computer.
You know what I mean?
With phone.

588
00:35:37.541 --> 00:35:41.380
And that makes it legitimately on your phone rather than just going through the

589
00:35:41.381 --> 00:35:45.760
air or whatever the fuck is going on.
Right.
You know,

590
00:35:45.761 --> 00:35:49.630
cause you've got the y Phi on and then the why Phi shuts off and then the album

591
00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:52.810
disappears.
So then you're old like me see a downloaded again.

592
00:35:52.811 --> 00:35:54.960
And then you got that album and then the,
the,
the two,

593
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:57.310
the first one comes back and now you've got doubles.

594
00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.110
How do you get rid of the other one?

595
00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.330
I've gotten into my iTunes and I've gone to delete it,

596
00:36:01.331 --> 00:36:03.700
but on my phone it's still a double,
so I don't know how to do it.

597
00:36:03.701 --> 00:36:07.930
So the song ends and then it replays again.
It plays everything twice.

598
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.780
That happened me with van Halen,

599
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.770
1984 and that NAS album illmatic 'em.

600
00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.740
As much as I love both of those albums,
I don't need both songs to play twice.

601
00:36:17.741 --> 00:36:19.900
How do I get rid of the other one?
If anybody can tell me,

602
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.360
I would really appreciate it.
All right.

603
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:23.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

604
00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.740
<v 1>Okay.
Kanye situation.
Hey,
Bill.</v>

605
00:36:26.741 --> 00:36:31.480
Red Blooded American male here who heard about the Kanye situation and was

606
00:36:31.481 --> 00:36:32.560
scared shitless.

607
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:37.140
I'm not going to disclose whether or not I enjoy what he was accused of enjoying

608
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.970
a parentheses.
If you don't know the story,

609
00:36:39.971 --> 00:36:44.080
his ex Amber Rose implied on Twitter that he enjoyed a finger in his ass.

610
00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:48.220
Actually it was fingers,
plural.
Yeah.

611
00:36:48.221 --> 00:36:51.970
I didn't hear about this fucking story and it may be feel good as a human being

612
00:36:51.971 --> 00:36:55.420
that I was somehow out of the loop of this fucking news.
He said,

613
00:36:55.421 --> 00:36:58.660
this scares me because it doesn't matter what you're into.

614
00:36:58.661 --> 00:37:03.390
If an x says shit like that,
you're going to get branded.
Um,

615
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:06.100
so are you.
Sound like you're x.
Put a vase in your ass.

616
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.240
Anyways,
he goes,
it's how urban myths about [inaudible] get started.

617
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.200
Unless you're fearless Jim Norton and you can say something like that with a

618
00:37:20.201 --> 00:37:24.090
smile on your face,
on the airways.
It's a pretty tough situation to be at.

619
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.810
How does a man like Kanye deal with that?

620
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.080
<v 0>Uh,
I don't know.</v>

621
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.720
<v 1>I,
I went,
I started to read it,
but I,
it just,</v>

622
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.050
I don't if it is true,
I don't give a shit

623
00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:46.540
really none of my business before I could tell from the article he was talking

624
00:37:46.611 --> 00:37:51.230
shit about her.
Now if she had half her head up,

625
00:37:51.231 --> 00:37:52.240
his fucking acid,

626
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.900
some point is probably not a smart idea if he's sensitive about that part of his

627
00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:59.510
sexuality to be talking Shit.

628
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.593
<v 0>Right.</v>

629
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.960
<v 1>Which makes me kind of believe him</v>

630
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.910
<v 0>then it didn't happen</v>

631
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.340
<v 1>because you figure if she had that over him,</v>

632
00:38:10.341 --> 00:38:13.670
if she was walking around with them like a sock puppet,
right.

633
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.850
That he wouldn't go around talking shit about her.

634
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.373
<v 0>I Dunno.</v>

635
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.710
<v 1>Gotta be honest.
It's one of those things that I,</v>

636
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:28.750
I legitimately feel is none of my fucking business.

637
00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:30.260
And uh,

638
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.040
whether it's true or not doesn't make me look at Kanye one way or the other.

639
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:37.630
I mean,
I don't give a fuck.
Give a shit what the guy does.

640
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:38.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

641
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.420
<v 1>And I also think a,
I don't think you walk around talking shit about,</v>

642
00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.570
someone used to go out with,
didn't work out.
Fucking grow up.

643
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.320
You're already married.
You found somebody else leave me alone.
Right.

644
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.690
I don't look,
I don't know what happened,
but all I know he was,
if,

645
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.660
if it's true that he was talking shit about her,

646
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:58.360
I probably should stop saying talking shit when we're talking about a finger up

647
00:38:58.361 --> 00:38:59.710
your ass.
Um,

648
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:01.870
<v 0>yeah.</v>

649
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:03.920
<v 1>You know what,
having said all that,
it's fucking hilarious.</v>

650
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.203
<v 2>MMM.</v>

651
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.853
<v 1>You know,</v>

652
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.000
I would think that there's a lot of rival rappers right now trying to write down

653
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:19.660
words that rhyme with the phrase fingers up your ass.

654
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.440
<v 0>Uh hmm.</v>

655
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:28.450
<v 1>Lingers in the class with fingers up your ass.
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
There's,</v>

656
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.880
there's gotta be something that they're coming up with.
That's an easy one too.

657
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

658
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:37.170
<v 1>If I was,
if I was a rapper and somebody said that my ex put fingers up my ass,</v>

659
00:39:37.171 --> 00:39:40.070
how all I would be thinking was like,
God dammit.
Why didn't she say rectum?

660
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.410
At least make it difficult to ride something rectum.
Check them.

661
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.770
You check them fingers up your rectum.
No fingers checked

662
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.600
through.
All clean going up your rectum.
Sorry.

663
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:02.223
<v 2>Anyways,</v>

664
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:08.510
<v 1>um,
flashes.
I like that at all.</v>

665
00:40:08.511 --> 00:40:13.070
That's 100% on him.
What about how at this.
Thank you fingers.
Now Jesus Christ,

666
00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.060
you got to go with the fist bump.
Now when you go the end,

667
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:19.940
when you run into amber,
give her the ll but more stay away from that.

668
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.750
Get a fucking tetanus shot.
Funny.

669
00:40:23.751 --> 00:40:26.900
She shook her hand and then all of a sudden you just started fucking talking

670
00:40:26.901 --> 00:40:31.190
shit about yourself the way Kanye does.
Um,
all right.
Classes.

671
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.600
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

672
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.410
<v 1>Uh,
in high school,
uh,
hello.
You orangutang looking mother fucker.</v>

673
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:41.360
I guarantee that this guy is the ugliest motherfucker.
I really find that people,

674
00:40:41.361 --> 00:40:46.040
uh,
people who trashed the way I look the most,
especially on Twitter,

675
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:49.970
never have like their,
uh,
never have their picture.

676
00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:55.250
I don't look like an orangutan.
Do I dare fucking older.

677
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.970
They look like old people.
Um,
in a housecoat uh,

678
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.710
I am a senior in high school.
Yeah.
Like a kid.

679
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.540
Oh you probably 18 at this point you're punk and this may seem childish to talk

680
00:41:08.541 --> 00:41:11.630
about,
but I been thinking about dropping one of my classes,

681
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.670
this class is music theory,

682
00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:18.320
a p and I'm a straight be studious students so I'm no genius.

683
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.490
I talked to my teacher and guidance counselor who both said it was fine to drop

684
00:41:22.491 --> 00:41:25.640
it.
Music theory being a unique class

685
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.800
bows.
That appendix right there at the end there.
That didn't make,

686
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:35.250
that was all part of that sentence.
Anyways,

687
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.900
recently I came into school thinking,
uh,
that was the shit.

688
00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:44.370
Like I came into school thinking that this shit was over and I wouldn't have to

689
00:41:44.371 --> 00:41:45.510
take the class anymore.

690
00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:49.170
Only they have the assistant principal of my school tell me that I would not be

691
00:41:49.171 --> 00:41:51.120
able to drop at that.

692
00:41:51.121 --> 00:41:55.140
This point I'm frustrated because I'm very unhappy in the class and the only

693
00:41:55.141 --> 00:41:59.790
ones separating me from dropping the class is my prick of an assistant
principal.

694
00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.110
Should I sack up and finish the rest of the year or should I stand up from my

695
00:42:04.111 --> 00:42:06.630
case and become a stubborn prick and the process,

696
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.010
the class gives me anxiety and I'm not really into music anymore.

697
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.980
I'm thinking about picking up a second English class.

698
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.290
If the principal doesn't let me drop the class,

699
00:42:16.291 --> 00:42:19.230
I would probably end up skipping it every day because I hate the class.

700
00:42:19.231 --> 00:42:23.340
That fucking much am I in the wrong?
Any advice would be great bill.
Thanks.

701
00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:28.200
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,
oh,
when I was a kid,
when you went to high school,

702
00:42:28.201 --> 00:42:32.520
you couldn't drop classes that happened in college.
You're a senior,

703
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.230
it's February,
don't you get out in like the middle of May.

704
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:39.623
Um,

705
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:43.590
and if you transfer it you have to make up the first two semesters or whatever

706
00:42:43.591 --> 00:42:44.424
the fuck it is.

707
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:50.060
September,
October,
November,

708
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.100
December and January worth of shit.
And your second English class.

709
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.540
I just tough it out.
It's music theory.

710
00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.720
I mean that sounds boring as shit.
Um,

711
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.910
but what I would just tough it up.

712
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.750
<v 2>Okay.</v>

713
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.320
<v 1>I,
I,
that's what I would do.
I mean,</v>

714
00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:09.280
I mean I would rather tough,
tough,

715
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.830
but when me and my were just speaking about myself personally,

716
00:43:11.831 --> 00:43:15.460
but I rather tough out music theory than day.

717
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.470
Take another fucking English class.
But that's me.
Yeah,

718
00:43:20.471 --> 00:43:25.310
Dude.
Just fucking tough it out.
What's it giving you?
Anxiety for it.

719
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.460
It's a music theory teacher.
It's not like they're going to be like,

720
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.210
so like the football coaches teaching it as e.
Yeah.
Fuck it.

721
00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:38.740
Tough it out.
That seems like a class that even if he just halfway pay attention,

722
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:43.180
he can at least get a c.
Right.
I Dunno dude.
This fucking,

723
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.940
it's fucking hangover from this God damn cooking.
I mean,

724
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.440
I fell asleep last night at like six o'clock.
I slept for like 12 fucking hours.

725
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.270
I'm still exhausted.
All right.
Being Stung by shit.

726
00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:57.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

727
00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.030
<v 1>Hey Billy,
big freckle balls.
Love that.</v>

728
00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:04.200
You guys think I suck my nuts.
Uh,

729
00:44:04.201 --> 00:44:09.201
your last podcast touched on being stung by spiders and Shit and you touched on

730
00:44:09.871 --> 00:44:14.710
sting rays.
Uh,
those fucks that killed Steve Urban and I,

731
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.550
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He fucked with them.

732
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:22.200
And the thing felt like it had to do to defend itself.
All right.

733
00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.060
I'll tell you right now,

734
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:29.990
the rejoicing that wildlife did overall when the crocodile hunter got killed,

735
00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.960
I mean,
the level of stress that he brought,

736
00:44:34.961 --> 00:44:39.310
every animal that he came into contact with all,
see,
he's hunching up.

737
00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.940
He doesn't like that.
The thing is in fear for his fucking life.

738
00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.810
And you're going up and you're fucking with the thing so you can,
you know,

739
00:44:46.811 --> 00:44:49.720
when you're little fucking booty shorts.
Anyways,
he goes,

740
00:44:49.721 --> 00:44:54.721
I'm Canadian and I spent five minutes in an American ocean and was stung by a

741
00:44:54.971 --> 00:44:57.870
sting ray.
Well,

742
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:01.200
all of your emotions are American to you live in North America.

743
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.650
We're all Americans.
But I guess once you say you're Canadian,

744
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:10.590
I'm United.
Okay.
I'm a Canadian.
I spent five minutes in an American ocean,

745
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:11.850
was stung by a sting ray.

746
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.060
It felt like a hot nail being driven through my foot and the pain went up and up

747
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.710
for hours.
It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
Uh,

748
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.040
let that be a lesson to all the listeners that sting rays are not something to

749
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:30.330
be fucked with.
Uh,
nothing can describe that pain.
It was insane.

750
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:35.850
Love the podcast.
Fuck you in Boston because they went so fucking always

751
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.670
cause they went so fucking always.
Um,
yeah.
Well you know,

752
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.690
this is the thing.
We're not supposed to be in the ocean.

753
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:46.833
<v 2>Okay.</v>

754
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:48.900
<v 1>Okay.
I want to say that again.</v>

755
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:55.140
We're not supposed to be in the ocean.
We can't breathe in there.

756
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.280
We can't see what's beneath us were completely vulnerable when we go in there.

757
00:45:59.281 --> 00:46:00.540
We're not supposed to be in there.

758
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:05.310
That sting ray has evolved to fuck up things that belong in the ocean,

759
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.730
all of which are way bigger and way faster.
Generally speaking,

760
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:13.860
some giant fish goes to fucking kill this thing.
Right.

761
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.360
It's got to have enough juice in its shank to make a Sharko away.

762
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:21.150
I would think so.
Yeah.
You come walking in,

763
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:26.070
you fucking pink feet.
Come walking in there.
If you're white,
right.

764
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.130
You go in there and you did just yet it's over.

765
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:33.890
So I'm surprised they don't got enough juice to kill you because I know Steve

766
00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.840
Irving,
what happened him as he got stabbed in the fucking,

767
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.780
I think it punctured his heart.
What are the odds of that?

768
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:46.820
I wonder what his fucking last thoughts were.

769
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.983
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

770
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.620
<v 1>he's folks are really fucking sting ray.</v>

771
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.480
What was he just thinking?
Hi,
let me just pull this out.

772
00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:02.410
I'm sure that'd be filed off.
Oh,
that's artery blood.
All right.

773
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.020
Love the podcasts.
Go Fuck you said.
You know what's funny?

774
00:47:05.021 --> 00:47:07.750
Somebody Australia's can be offended that I'm actually fucking talk like they

775
00:47:07.751 --> 00:47:10.780
haven't thought about this shit,
but isn't it like 10 years ago?

776
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.130
What is the statute of limitations when you,
uh,

777
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:19.960
deliberately go and fuck with the sting ray and get killed by that?
It's um,

778
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.490
that you can't keep talking about it.
All right.
Beer drinking contest advice.

779
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.900
Dear Billy,
beer bomb,
I'm a big fan man.

780
00:47:28.901 --> 00:47:33.200
I to your podcast for a couple of years now and I had the chance to see you

781
00:47:33.201 --> 00:47:36.770
Versie and bod nick at the Chicago theater.
Great show.

782
00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.960
So I'd been roped into a beard.

783
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.980
Beer-Drinking Olympics parentheses for charity by a buddy of mine.

784
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.300
And being that I'm an old fuck,
not quite what you are.
I'm 38.

785
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:52.390
I was wondering if you have advice in terms of longevity backstory on me.

786
00:47:52.611 --> 00:47:57.350
I'm a Canadian.
I'm a Canadian pocket square wearing a habs fan.

787
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.240
I know.
Fuck me.
Right?
I don't give a shit.

788
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.480
As long as you have a sense of humor about yourself that can really hammer them

789
00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:06.470
back.
Bear is my first choice when I drank as I assume as yours.

790
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.530
What would you do to get ready for something like this?
Thanks.

791
00:48:09.531 --> 00:48:13.850
And Go fuck yourself.
Um,
well you got to,
I would think,

792
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.890
aren't they going to be different events?
You know,

793
00:48:19.891 --> 00:48:23.580
there's gotta be drinking beer.
There's got to be drinking hard stuff.

794
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:29.390
Is it all just going to be beer drinking?
Wait a second.

795
00:48:29.391 --> 00:48:31.700
I was wondering if you have any advice in terms of longevity.
All right.

796
00:48:31.701 --> 00:48:33.470
As far I thought you meant how to,
how to live long.

797
00:48:33.471 --> 00:48:36.260
Do you mean how to hang in there?
Um,

798
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.070
well if it's a beer drinking contest,

799
00:48:40.071 --> 00:48:44.030
then I would just drink hard stuff leading up to it.
You know,

800
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.180
a couple of beers and it had like your shots too,
you know,
I dunno.

801
00:48:48.181 --> 00:48:49.440
Build up your tolerance.

802
00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.980
This doesn't seem like this is a responsible thing for me to be telling you to

803
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:57.150
do.
I would be,
I would just go there and have a good time.
That's what I would do.

804
00:48:57.151 --> 00:48:58.440
And I wouldn't try to win a metal.

805
00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:01.020
You don't want to be the guy that wins that the guy wins.

806
00:49:01.021 --> 00:49:04.350
That's going to have like fucking rosacea on the side of his face from booze and

807
00:49:04.351 --> 00:49:06.570
you know,
it's going to look like fucking WC fields.

808
00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.670
You don't want to be the guy that can win that contest.

809
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.770
I would say just go there and have a good time,
you know,
Eh,

810
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.350
stop short of being the guy that fucking pukes all over everybody.

811
00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.950
That would be my advice.
Uh,
all right.

812
00:49:19.951 --> 00:49:22.950
Let me do the last reads here really quickly and then I'll do the last question

813
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.490
is I'm fucking trying to shake off this.

814
00:49:26.491 --> 00:49:31.230
God Damn yawning from that fucking cookie.
Come like overtired here.
All right.

815
00:49:31.231 --> 00:49:35.100
Okay.
I have you guys been watching any of the Super Bowl pregame?
Why would you,

816
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.680
are they doing the old man versus the young man,

817
00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:42.390
<v 3>but for the Denver Broncos,
Holloway,
Stop Cam Newton,
newbies,</v>

818
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.760
panthers of the fucking Carolina,

819
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.150
<v 1>let's say about cab building is this guy is one of those rare talents that just</v>

820
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.180
can hurt you on every level.

821
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.340
<v 0>Okay?</v>

822
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.580
<v 1>He covers receivers.
No problem.
This guy is going to run it.</v>

823
00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:00.330
You're going to rush this guy.
You can't bring them dabble.
Just what guy?

824
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.510
You got to stand there and stare at him.
He's got to pick you apart.

825
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:04.710
I'll tell you right now,

826
00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:09.090
I would not want to have this job as being a coach is Denver Bronco date fence?

827
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.920
<v 3>Well,
like,
what are you saying?
Are you going to do,</v>

828
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.810
who do we think the key the game is?

829
00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:17.920
Deborah has to go to ball and they have to score it.
Really?
They got a score.

830
00:50:17.921 --> 00:50:22.921
Often their best hope to control care noon is to take the pictures out of deer

831
00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:26.620
gay plan.
If they're playing catch up all night,
you know what?
Dead,

832
00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:30.430
Denver and Da da Da.
And you don't care.
You know,

833
00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:34.620
I know Peyton Manning's older,
but this is still paid Manny.
Okay,
just last game.

834
00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.400
I'll tell you right now,
he's a competitor.

835
00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:40.150
He's going to get out there and although to peer teach you have a good defense.

836
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.880
They still are a young defensive unit.
Okay.

837
00:50:42.881 --> 00:50:44.710
And then you'd watch that to come into play,

838
00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.410
especially after they make their halftime adjustments.

839
00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:53.400
<v 1>Is that about it?
Something like that there can try to exploit the seeds.
Um,</v>

840
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:54.780
what about special teams?

841
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.460
What about Peyton Manning's wife taking HGH?

842
00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:02.730
What are the odds of that dollar shave club?
Everyone.

843
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:06.930
Lots of players will be sporting playoff beard.
Now that the post seasons here,

844
00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:10.620
can you imagine if Jazelle was getting fucking HGH sent to the house?

845
00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:14.070
I'm sure that story,
we're just disappear after a couple of moments.

846
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.230
Leave that to the pros.
Kickoff your year the right way with a fresh blade shave.

847
00:51:19.231 --> 00:51:23.310
That's why me and when millions of others have joined the dollar shave club.com

848
00:51:23.311 --> 00:51:27.630
revolution.
Dollar Shave Club knows that the key to getting an amazing shave,

849
00:51:27.631 --> 00:51:32.450
it's simple.
One,
use a fresh dollar shave club blade to use their doctor cabbies.

850
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:33.450
Eez Shea,

851
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:34.423
<v 2>bye.</v>

852
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:36.523
<v 1>That's it.</v>

853
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.280
Dollar Shave Club delivers amazing razors right to my door for a third.

854
00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:43.280
The price of those greedy mega razor corporations.

855
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.450
That means listeners who switched now can afford the luxury of shaving with a

856
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:50.240
fresh blade anytime and save hundreds this year.

857
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.970
And when you combine that fresh blade with their doctor,
ca Bzz Shea.

858
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.983
<v 2>Wow.</v>

859
00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.830
<v 1>It just glides.
Done.
Imagine we smooth.
I'm telling you,</v>

860
00:51:59.831 --> 00:52:03.010
it's not your average shave form.
It won't dry out your skin.

861
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:06.220
The all natural ingredients.
Leave your skin feeling soft,

862
00:52:06.221 --> 00:52:09.760
smooth and moisturized after every shape.
Take it from me.

863
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:13.120
Use a fresh dollar shave club blade with doctor cabbies.

864
00:52:13.121 --> 00:52:17.460

mercifully is ended.

890
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.550
Um,
all right,
let's get back to a,

891
00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:43.610
I got one more read here and then I got to wrap this fucker up.

892
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:48.770
It's time for me to go.
All right.
Dating in the workplace.

893
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.750
They Aka no GG
Billy fuckboy birth.

894
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.720
Oh Hey.
By the way,
I finished on the second season of top boy.
I highly,
uh,

895
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:02.180
I highly recommend it.
Um,
all right.

896
00:54:02.181 --> 00:54:07.160
There's a lady in my workplace that I have a huge crush on,

897
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:11.840
but I fucked everything up by drunkenly telling her best friend at a company

898
00:54:11.841 --> 00:54:14.300
holiday party that I had a crush on honor.

899
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:17.930
I say fucked up because I know how females communicate.

900
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:23.230
I might as well have just walked up to the girl I had a crush on and told her I

901
00:54:23.811 --> 00:54:24.950
know from a past job,

902
00:54:24.951 --> 00:54:28.240
but dating in the workplace fucks everything else up at work.

903
00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.560
Had told myself I'd never do it again,

904
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:34.670
but for some reason my brain couldn't say no to this girl anyway.

905
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.990
I know this girl knows I like her from her best friend and it made our work

906
00:54:38.991 --> 00:54:42.080
dynamic awkward just because when we interact now,

907
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:46.850
both of us feel like we have to fulfill some sort of role.

908
00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.320
<v 0>Okay,</v>

909
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.050
<v 1>well you should just walked up to it says,
Hey,
I got a little drunk.</v>

910
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:55.100
I said some things to your girlfriend,
uh,
that you know,

911
00:54:55.101 --> 00:54:59.560
I should have said to you die.
I can't say that.
That's two Ford.
Oh,

912
00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:00.890
the office just makes it creepy.

913
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.130
You can't lean on anything as you're talking to her,

914
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:08.330
you might as well just you standing there rubbing your balls.
Aww.

915
00:55:08.331 --> 00:55:09.350
This is situation.

916
00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:14.180
One day I said fuck it and half assed or route to an art museum.

917
00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.420
But she had friends in town said she couldn't.

918
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.650
What pisses me off is that I used to hang out with my coworkers and this girl

919
00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:25.040
every now and then now,
no,
no one invites me to hang out.

920
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:28.430
When they do a background on the company,

921
00:55:28.431 --> 00:55:32.720
it's under a hundred people and we're all in our twenties for the most part.
Uh,

922
00:55:32.721 --> 00:55:36.380
what's the best way to pursue this girl in this situation and how do I mentally

923
00:55:36.381 --> 00:55:39.460
handle the fact that it's affected my ability to hang out with my coworkers,

924
00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:44.150
my other coworkers,
I really want closure to this thing,
whether it be a date,

925
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:47.450
whether I date her or she tells me she's done interested.

926
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.170
I don't care at this point.
I really don't like the tension at work.
Thanks.

927
00:55:51.171 --> 00:55:55.100
And Go fuck yourself.
Yeah.
Which says to me you don't really even like this girl.

928
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.300
<v 0>Okay</v>

929
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:00.400
<v 1>Mike,
I just want to ask around,
get rid of the tension and then she says yes.</v>

930
00:56:00.401 --> 00:56:04.200
So she says,
no,
I really don't give a fuck at this moment.
This is what you do.

931
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.700
This is what you do,
sir.
He just just fucking blow it off.

932
00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:10.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

933
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:15.350
<v 1>Just blow it off.
You don't give a shit.
Just act normal around her.
All right.</v>

934
00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.780
That she'll be gone like,
oh he doesn't give a fuck.

935
00:56:17.781 --> 00:56:20.600
And then she'll probably end up being an interested in youth cause that's how

936
00:56:20.601 --> 00:56:25.100
they fucking work.
All right.
I don't hang out with the people you work with.

937
00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.900
Fuck someone you don't work with.

938
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:30.080
You need to create a social circle outside of work.

939
00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:34.520
The people at work should be the people you see Monday through Friday.
Okay.

940
00:56:34.521 --> 00:56:38.000
And then once Friday,
see you later guys.
Take it easy.
What are you doing?

941
00:56:38.001 --> 00:56:41.360
I'm getting the fuck away from you,
right?
Then you go out,

942
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:44.600
you can do your fucking black tar heroin or whatever the fuck you want to do.

943
00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:47.750
And then there's no awkwardness at the copier.
All right?

944
00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:53.210
You already said the give you fuck somebody that you work with before and how

945
00:56:53.211 --> 00:56:55.880
that made your last job awkward yet.
Here you go again.

946
00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:00.800
And for some reason you're not even in a relationship yet and it's already

947
00:57:00.801 --> 00:57:02.420
fucking up your coat.
Your uh,

948
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:04.510
<v 0>okay.</v>

949
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.991
<v 1>Just your,</v>

950
00:57:04.991 --> 00:57:08.050
your interaction with your coworkers yet you want to pursue this thing too.

951
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.670
I would just let it go.
Just let it go.
And uh,

952
00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.213
<v 0>listen,</v>

953
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.050
<v 1>he want to fuck somebody at work.
Don't try and fuck them.
All right.</v>

954
00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.190
Just come in with a big smile on your face on Monday and everything.
You know,

955
00:57:23.191 --> 00:57:26.490
nobody knows what the fuck you did and they're all hanging out with each other.

956
00:57:26.491 --> 00:57:28.770
They're all gossiping with each other and eventually they're going to be

957
00:57:28.771 --> 00:57:32.850
gossiping about you.
Hey,
I wonder what he does.
What's up with his exciting life?

958
00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:33.923
You know,

959
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:37.890
you're coming in looking like you're out there banging away and fucking having a

960
00:57:37.891 --> 00:57:40.770
great time going out on the town event.
She,

961
00:57:40.771 --> 00:57:43.440
one of these broads is going to be fucking interested enough and then you know

962
00:57:43.441 --> 00:57:46.920
what?
Your dumb ass is going to fuck her and then it's going to be awkward again.

963
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:50.940
Can't do it dude.
You got it.
You got to have a fucking do your social,
sir.

964
00:57:50.941 --> 00:57:55.380
You're fucking,
and you're drinking and all that.
It has to be outside of work.
Um,

965
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.680
unless it's a guy,
okay.
It cannot be,

966
00:57:58.681 --> 00:58:00.750
cannot fucking hang with women that you work with.

967
00:58:00.751 --> 00:58:04.080
You can't do it because eventually your decks going to make you say something

968
00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:05.400
stupid.
Something's going to happen.

969
00:58:05.401 --> 00:58:08.850
Well that's going to get in the fucking way and it's just going to be a big be a

970
00:58:08.851 --> 00:58:13.080
big God damn problem.
Uh,
same thing.
Don't hang out with your boss either.

971
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.250
Hang out with someone that's on your fucking level.
And even then,
dude,

972
00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:19.620
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hang out.
You don't hang out with people you work with.

973
00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:22.440
You know,
something always ends up happening.

974
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.890
Maybe you do something dumb and then your buddy can't keep his fucking mouth

975
00:58:25.891 --> 00:58:30.450
shut,
you know,
and then it gets to somebody and then that year up for your,

976
00:58:30.451 --> 00:58:34.350
your,
your review.
You don't get as much money.
You get passed over.

977
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.970
It's fucking stupid.
You were in your 20s,
you're going to make it,

978
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.940
you're going to make a bunch of fucking mistakes.

979
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.790
So don't do it with the people you work with.
All right.

980
00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:46.080
Have I said that enough times?
All right.
Having said that,

981
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.480
<v 0>okay.</v>

982
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.230
<v 1>Um,
you want my super bowl pick?
Um,</v>

983
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:56.560
I actually liked the Broncos with the points if they getting six and don't

984
00:58:57.291 --> 00:58:59.990
listen to me because I don't know anything about the Broncos coach,

985
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.340
but I know bill Belicheck with Peyton manning and that defense could figure out

986
00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:08.480
a way to,
uh,
beat the Carolina Panthers.

987
00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.670
And I know what a lot of you guys are thinking.

988
00:59:10.671 --> 00:59:14.390
Well that defense in that coach and Peyton manning just beat your patriots and

989
00:59:14.391 --> 00:59:17.840
Bill Bellacheck.
It's like,
well he didn't have the team,
you know.

990
00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.293
Um,

991
00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:24.770
my only is that Denver's defense isn't as good as it looked against the patriots

992
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.220
because a,
we had that Swiss cheese fucking offensive line.

993
00:59:28.221 --> 00:59:31.610
We had injuries all that year and Carolina looks really healthy,

994
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.670
their offensive line looks really healthy.
So,
uh,

995
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.963
I dunno,

996
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.970
I think that bullshit that I actually said earlier where I was making fun of

997
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:41.660
those analysis,

998
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:46.460
those analysts is actually what I think Denver better hope that when the toss,

999
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:50.610
and I would say take the ball rather than deferring it and hopefully you march

1000
00:59:50.611 --> 00:59:55.130
down the field,
score seven,
give them a three and out.
I think,

1001
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:57.590
I literally think that they then need to score again,

1002
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.280
go up 10 [inaudible] this is my keys to the gay Denver.

1003
01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.740
When the toss they need to go out there,

1004
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:11.450
it's somehow get it done and choose heads.
If it's going to be heads,
tails,

1005
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:14.760
if it's going to be tails,
then they got a risk.

1006
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:20.150
Take the fucking ball,
ram it down their fucking throats.
Yeah,

1007
01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:21.650
just obvious shit.

1008
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.480
Nice time consuming drive and uh,

1009
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.160
stablish the run.
Um,

1010
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.860
I think Peyton could do all right against that defense if they,
if they,
uh,

1011
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:37.350
you know,
if he has to fucking time.

1012
01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:41.930
See there's no way to say really bill,
what if he doesn't have the time?

1013
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.930
Does that make it more difficult?
This is really hard.
This is really,

1014
01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:48.200
it's really hard to say something that isn't cliched.
Um,

1015
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.840
my,
my concern is a Broncos fan is that the panthers get the ball,

1016
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.590
they march right down the field and they score it because what's his face,

1017
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.920
Peyton manning is,
is gloom and doom guy.

1018
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.190
That guy gets that look on his face.
Peyton faces what?

1019
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:06.020
Me and my family used to call it where he just,

1020
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.450
he just purses his lips and he starts looking,

1021
01:01:08.451 --> 01:01:12.470
downfield shaking his head as he takes his fucking Chin strap off after yet

1022
01:01:12.471 --> 01:01:15.660
another three and out.
That's the,
that's the,

1023
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:19.820
the headspace panthers want to get him in.
If he gets into the,

1024
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:24.330
he gets into that.
Why isn't everybody as good as me mindset?
Uh,

1025
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:27.890
it's fucking over.
So in order to keep him happy,

1026
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:33.080
I'd say that they got a score or back to that again,
that Jesus,

1027
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:36.770
maybe I'll come up with something on Thursday.
There you go.
Everybody that Bup,

1028
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:40.790
Bup,
bup,
Odo,
Buddha.
I take the Broncos in the points.

1029
01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:42.530
I take six points.
Fuck it.

1030
01:01:42.531 --> 01:01:45.650
Cause every cunt out there is going to take the panthers every cunt out.

1031
01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:47.960
There's going to the is,
you're going to fucking destroy them.

1032
01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.800
That's when you want to go the other way because whatever that means that every

1033
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:55.490
fucking shit at out there,
it's going to put money on the pant is,

1034
01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:59.300
which means the line.
We'll keep going up because Vegas is one.
Again,

1035
01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:03.500
this is going to want to get money on both sides of the ball.
Thank you bill.

1036
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.280
Like we didn't know that.
I'll fuck you.
I'll talk to you guys on Thursday.

1037
01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:11.120
Go fuck yourselves.
And um,
don't fuck anybody you work with.
