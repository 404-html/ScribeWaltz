00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.960
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:08.150
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast at [inaudible].

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.360
Just checking again of just checking in on,
you know,

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.050
just seeing how your week is going.
This is,
this is a,
it's a hard week.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.640
<v 1>Coming off the holiday vacation,
you know,
at some point on your vacation,</v>

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.751
you know,

8
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.440
a certain thought pops into your head and I'm not talking about walking out the

9
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:29.560
front door and just abandoning your family,
you know,

10
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.990
and not even because you don't like your family.

11
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:35.350
Maybe it's a relative that's just their cackle,
you know,

12
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:38.620
when it's just making your eardrums just vibrate in a certain way that,

13
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:42.760
that it wakes up that part of your brain that just doesn't give a fuck.
You know,

14
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.600
the Party of brain that's sociopath's are always it.
You know what I mean?

15
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.070
Just the wrong cackle can open that door for a minute and then your brain starts

16
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:52.600
going like,
what if we just got up and left

17
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.850
and what came back later?
And no,
no dude left like left.

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.560
Not like left or right.
I mean leave left.
Gone.

19
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.430
What if you did that right.
Um,
plus also it's the beginning of a new year.

20
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:11.350
There's a lot of hope in the air.

21
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.830
<v 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.490
chance for new things and if you'd like to keep that hope,

24
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.850
ah,
you probably shouldn't watch the news because you know,

25
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:25.480
I've been fucking working my ass off already.
And uh,
I was like,
wow,

26
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.810
I got really nothing to talk about.
Let me take a glance at the news.

27
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.830
Good Lord.
Good Lord.

28
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:34.480
I just googled news there,

29
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:38.350
this whole article on Donald Trump about how he never wanted to become president

30
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.900
and then just some of the quotes they have,
it's like,

31
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.460
where did you get that quote?

32
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.610
You know something about Donald Trump being like,
yeah,

33
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:48.670
I'm not going to win this fucking thing.
And then he finds out,

34
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.030
he made it to the next level and he just showed it,

35
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.160
looked ahead and see and allegedly said,

36
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.210
this is so fucked up.
It's like,
who knew that he said that?

37
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:03.080
And I don't,
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

38
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.710
And then I'm watching all this stuff and Palestine and that the whole fucking

39
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:11.060
thing.
It's just about money.
That's all it is.

40
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:12.500
It's about fucking money.

41
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.610
<v 0>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.220
<v 1>You don't want,
sometimes I wonder if everybody in the world,
right.</v>

43
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.000
It has to be a weird game to play it right with all these fucking rich people

44
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.220
just squeeze in the fucking life out of everybody.

45
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.360
Pitting everybody against everybody.
If he just,

46
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:31.540
if everybody in the world just was just like,
well,
what do you,
what do you want?

47
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.860
Huh?
What?
What exactly is that?
The tea she's take it.

48
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.420
Does that make you happy?
I don't think,
I don't even think they could enjoy it.

49
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.900
They could have the biggest fucking house on the biggest hail and the biggest

50
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.590
side of town.
All of that fucking ric flair shit.
Right with minus the humor.

51
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.090
They could have all of that.

52
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.190
And the fact that everybody beneath him wasn't miserable on some level.

53
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:57.300
I don't honestly think that they could enjoy it.
Um,

54
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.920
who is a built,
give me one.
I don't know.
I looked at the news for 10 minutes,

55
00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:03.180
such,
that's what I felt.

56
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.880
That's why I don't watch it because it makes me think things like that.

57
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.170
All right.
I don't like fucking seeing people around the world crying.

58
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.430
I don't know.
You know,
I gotta commend people who actually try and pay attention.

59
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:17.880
Maybe that's why they,
they just blame one side or the other.

60
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.920
Cause other than that,
if you just sort of try to look at it in an impartial way,

61
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:26.250
you're just like,
we're just the fuck are we doing to each other.

62
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.010
It's really depressing.
So let's get out of this.

63
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

64
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.670
<v 1>You know,
I'm,
I solve any fucking problems.
Here was kitten.
Whoa,</v>

65
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.080
this podcast supposed to be an escape.
Um,
anybody watched?

66
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.090
Uh,
the Sally is Boston Celtics Force to Cleveland Cavaliers.

67
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:47.010
I had a bad feeling about this one.
I was like that white dude and put tune like,

68
00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:49.790
man,
I got a bad thing.
Um,

69
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.650
before he charged up for shit this time I thought Lebron was going to come in

70
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.950
and I was like,
Ooh,
boy.
Oh boy.
I was the thought Isaiah Thomas' plan,

71
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.910
but he wasn't playing and love went down.
But I mean,

72
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.090
he played most of the game,
but uh,
so that's the game.
We should have one.

73
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.930
And not only did we win,
we won by 20.
And you know what that means?
Come April.

74
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.600
It doesn't mean shit,
doesn't mean shit.

75
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.560
Maybe if we'd go down to one game and it comes down to home court,

76
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.730
we went by one game.
Maybe it means that,
but other than that,
it's just a winter,

77
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:22.564
January.

78
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.013
<v 2>But,
um,</v>

79
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.280
<v 1>I dunno,
when I look at the Cavs,
I'm just like,
all right,
these guys,</v>

80
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:28.630
when they get to the fucking playoffs,

81
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.050
they get enough grizzled vets and then they got superman playing for him.

82
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.030
They got jr Smith was the Shit Isaiah,
we all know what the fuck he could do.

83
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.280
They got fucking Jae Crowder,
right?
I mean,
they,
they,

84
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:46.510
and then they got love.
I mean,
that's a hell of a fucking team.
So,

85
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.310
but when I look at the Celtics,
I just see that when next,
you know what I mean?

86
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.820
It's like Cleveland is that old movie star that still fucking selling more

87
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:02.320
tickets than the young buck coming up.
But that person knows,
they know,

88
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.000
right.
They know that they're Burt Reynolds and uh,

89
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.610
I don't know what Tom Cruise,
I don't know who to pick next.

90
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.390
And when Burt Reynolds and then it was Tom Selleck,

91
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:21.391
which was weird when I was growing up every fucking like movie star Dude,

92
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.600
we had to be a guy's guy with that fucking mustache.

93
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.280
So it went from Burt Reynolds,
who I think established the look

94
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.693
<v 2>right?</v>

95
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.530
<v 1>Danny had Tom Selleck.
Denny had that Guy Played Matt Houston.</v>

96
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.250
And then somewhere in there the mustache went away.

97
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.960
But there was like a seven to eight year period with that mustache,

98
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.280
you know,
and the black curly hair,
you had to have that shit.

99
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.340
You know all these fucking groups that think all you gotta do is just be a white

100
00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:57.110
guy and the door opens.
No,

101
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.360
they're looking for that fucking dope.

102
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.520
You had to be that white dude with the jet black hair and that fucking mustache.

103
00:06:05.521 --> 00:06:07.170
And if you,
you had to be the Marlboro man.

104
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.360
He looked like me.
My fucking role models growing up.
Who was all be Ron Howard,

105
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.800
Ralph mouth burning for room two 22.
None of them got any pussy.

106
00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:20.461
You know what I mean?

107
00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:25.461
Rob Ritchie was fucking had a longterm fucking relationship and it's the prime

108
00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:29.970
of his life.
Well,
Lori Beth,
who,
what are you doing this weekend?
Meanwhile?
Fonz,

109
00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:33.300
he's having a fucking threesome over by the jukebox.

110
00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:37.230
Everybody's looking together way.
Why?
Because he had that hair.

111
00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:41.390
He had that fucking,
you had the right colored hair.
That's how it works.
Um,

112
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.280
anyways,
I don't mean what the fuck I'm talking.

113
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.270
What the fuck was I just talking about?
But we're,

114
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.740
are we talking about basketball here?
Fuck.
Am I talking about Fonzie now?

115
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.210
Basketball.
So that was a big,
that was a big one for us.

116
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.970
Big Idea one for us,
but you know who's getting him?

117
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.400
You could beat the cavs and January anyway,
but then you went far as avid cub,

118
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.330
April,
a bad ad way.
The big boys [inaudible] one layer at a time.
All at bullshit.

119
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:14.560
Right?
But whenever it was a fun game to watch and uh,

120
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.600
considering I took my lady to a Celtics game when I went home for Christmas,

121
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.330
uh,
she's kind of watching now.
I got her watching.

122
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.550
It's fucking incredible.

123
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.613
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

124
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.950
<v 1>she's not rabid yet.
She's not rabid.
I got to get him into the day in,
day out,</v>

125
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.010
fucking soap opera of it.
You know what I mean?
The way she got me into,

126
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:42.010
uh,
uh,

127
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.480
one is that fucking show that she watches hip hop or love,

128
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.400
something like that.
Love and hip hop.
That's what it is.

129
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.890
I fucking watch that show.

130
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.000
I can actually sorta handle that show

131
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.860
other than there's just one chick on there who just,
I swear to God,

132
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:08.270
I don't know what she just looks like.
She looks like an evil man.

133
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.690
You know what I mean?
And I don't mean like a,

134
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.530
like sinister,
I literally,
I literally mean like possessed by the devil.

135
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.530
They do this fucking weird thing on all reality shows now.

136
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.980
I think they kind of stopped,
but these were older episodes.

137
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.820
Do you know that thing they do where they,
they put those,
those cat eyes,

138
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.300
whatever that filter,
whatever the fuck that proper technology,

139
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.680
technological term is.

140
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.370
When they shoot those people talking right on the reality shows they do that

141
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:42.340
thing where they give them like three highlights in their fucking high.

142
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.690
Then it looks like they're starting to turn into something but they never do.

143
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:50.590
You know what I mean?
Um,
they kind of do that.

144
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.350
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.

145
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.650
I never feel wider though when I watched like when I watch love and hip hop

146
00:08:57.651 --> 00:09:01.310
though,
you know what I mean?
Cause I have no idea what the fuck's going on.

147
00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:06.050
I can't tell who's a good rapper,
who is it?
But I will tell you this,

148
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.680
like most white people,
if you change your fucking we've,

149
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.410
I can't stay I the amount of times I'm like,

150
00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:15.560
that's the same woman because they'll cut back and forth

151
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.290
and the woman will go from jet black hair to fucking blonde hair or,

152
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.120
or black with purple and then change the color of a fucking eyes,
you know,

153
00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:29.180
as white as I am.
I guess that's a completely different person.
Yeah.

154
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.913
<v 0>Okay.</v>

155
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.770
<v 1>Um,
which is why no white person should ever be on a jury.</v>

156
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.070
Right.
If there's somebody black involved,

157
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.810
I feel just from just from my own personal experience how fucking dumb I am.

158
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:51.050
I just made that blanket statement on how the entire just judicial system should

159
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:55.230
work in this country.
How about those fucking Boston Bro?
It's Huh?

160
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.890
They fucking want again.
They're like seven.
Oh one,
two in their last nine.

161
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.280
What did Jack Ed would say?
And then he said like 16,

162
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:10.281
three and two when the last 21 they're on fire right now.

163
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:11.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

164
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:16.200
<v 1>They were on fire when it doesn't count.
No.
Um,
you know the deal,
but it's good.</v>

165
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.630
It's great that they're playing with at the plane and I haven't been able to

166
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:20.730
watch them as much.
I know that they're playing the panthers,

167
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:24.930
so I'm watching that game.
So,
uh,
cause I'm in the bowl teams right now.

168
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.130
So now rather than,

169
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.910
I usually what I did was I would watch almost every Bruins game and then I would

170
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:32.010
watch,
you know,

171
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.470
important Celtics games or whatever.
But,
uh,
now I kind of,

172
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:40.800
I've gotten into both of them cause they're both young teams playing fucking

173
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:41.634
great.

174
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.930
And I got a kid and just the way it's been working with the dad responsibilities

175
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:49.140
is every time the fucking Bruins have a game,
I got to do some dad stuff,

176
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:53.040
which of course comes first.
No disrespect to my beloved Bruins.
Okay.

177
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.750
Um,
but anyways,
I'm going to watch,
what is it tomorrow night?

178
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.170
Yeah,
game comes on at five.
Aldi.
I can watch that.
I'll definitely watch that.
Um,

179
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.480
all right,
so that's it.
I think I don't have anything else to talk about.
Oh,

180
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:09.000
by the way.
All right.

181
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.380
I want to thank that person that fucking said that I was an alcoholic and that I

182
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:14.850
should be a friend of bill w whatever the fuck it,

183
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.490
which just sounds like another Bush,
you know,

184
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.990
it's going to be running for office,
um,

185
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.270
later on sitting down to South America with the fucking land that he bought that

186
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:28.860
sits on a fucking
aquifer painting.

187
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.130
<v 0>Okay.</v>

188
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:35.650
<v 1>I would I,</v>

189
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.650
the amount of money I would pay t to just be in George W's had,

190
00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.470
you know,
not Obama said

191
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:45.890
<v 0>yeah,</v>

192
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.070
<v 1>Obama just sounds like he would be,
he would sound like the way you talk,</v>

193
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:51.800
all blah blah blah,
blah blah.
What the fuck he was talking about,
you know?

194
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.073
<v 0>Okay.</v>

195
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.920
<v 1>But I dunno if somebody wd always fascinated me.
They would just be sitting there</v>

196
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.570
like,
what the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?
Did I really do that shit?

197
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.770
You know,
I don't sell about that guy.
Always looking at that.

198
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:12.310
Looks like the kind of guy who would take summer school with,
you know,

199
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.680
Obama is like the kiss ass

200
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.273
<v 3>fucking</v>

201
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.270
<v 1>raises hand when you forgot to assign homework,</v>

202
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.360
you wouldn't really is,
is I don't like smart people.

203
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.100
You know,
I have a lot of weird things.
I don't know.
I don't look a certain type.

204
00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.300
I don't like book smart people.
Uh,

205
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.340
just cause I see this is all petty shit just cause I'm not good at it.
And uh,

206
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.230
and the older I've gotten,

207
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:45.060
I realized somewhere along the line I don't like beautiful women.
Obviously.

208
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:47.850
They're fun to look at,
obviously,
like my wife is fucking gorgeous.

209
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:51.570
I think she's gorgeous.
But generally speaking,
I don't like beautiful women.

210
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.110
I just don't like it.
And it's for very simple reason.

211
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.520
They did their fucking rude
ditch.

212
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.500
They're just fucking rude.
They just don't have just,

213
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.770
just common politeness I guess on some level because if they're even remotely

214
00:13:10.351 --> 00:13:14.000
polite,
maybe a guy's like,
oh,
she wants it.
And then they can't get rid of them.

215
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.330
<v 3>But uh,</v>

216
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.390
<v 1>ditches,
ditches,
fucking rude.</v>

217
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.650
I can't tell you the amount of fucking times at the end of my show,

218
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.240
right.
Someone will come back,

219
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:35.090
some guy will come back,
you know,
a couple of guys and they got like,
you know,

220
00:13:35.091 --> 00:13:37.160
three or four beautiful women with them,
whatever.

221
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:40.490
And they come back to say thank you for the show and the fucking women,

222
00:13:40.491 --> 00:13:44.690
I swear to God ditches,
they're always bored.

223
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.820
Never say thank you.
And I always end up feeling like,

224
00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:51.410
just why Swi always going to be like,

225
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.990
why didn't you two guys just come back here with,
just say,
obviously I don't,

226
00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:59.060
didn't enjoy the show,
or they were upset that they didn't get to meet Oprah.

227
00:13:59.061 --> 00:14:00.260
I don't know what I mean.
This is all,

228
00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:04.160
I got a bald Red Ed and dad's jumps around like a fucking monkey or more.

229
00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:07.250
Do you want from me?
I could sweaty to dig.
They come back.

230
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.120
They don't even say thanks even if you didn't like the shell.
Right.

231
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.700
Okay.
Like say I went to one of their fucking show,

232
00:14:14.701 --> 00:14:17.210
some fashion show where they walked down the fucking runway.

233
00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:18.650
Like they're all pissed off,
you know?

234
00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:22.340
I don't know why God knows they haven't bought a drink and the whole fucking

235
00:14:22.341 --> 00:14:24.320
life,
I don't know what they're so fucking mad about.

236
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.090
Even if I didn't enjoy the show,

237
00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:29.120
even though I thought what they were wearing was ridiculous when I went back,

238
00:14:29.121 --> 00:14:33.220
I would be nice enough to be like,
Hey,
you know?
Yeah.
I liked the way.
Yeah.

239
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.010
When you walk,
how your legs cross over and funny beats.
You did a heck of a job,

240
00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:41.180
you know you didn't,
you didn't fall over and no shoes.
I could never do that.

241
00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:42.010
I wouldn't lease tab to,

242
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.750
to common decency to say that or I wouldn't go back there.

243
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:46.980
<v 3>Okay.</v>

244
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.900
<v 1>Bored shitless.
I'm bored shitless.
I,
I dunno,</v>

245
00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:57.400
I always fought,
have always fight the urge to be like,
what do you do?

246
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.760
What the fuck do you do other than sit there and look at amazing,

247
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.190
what the fuck did you just sit there?

248
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.533
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

249
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.700
<v 1>How many times a day does a beautiful woman's sy just out of boredom?</v>

250
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.510
You know what I mean?

251
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.380
I just feel like you could take them to an SNL taping and they would be excited

252
00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:18.400
until like,
I dunno,
somewhere in the middle of it,
you know,

253
00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:21.220
when the sketch was about them,
they would just start to get upset.

254
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.410
This is really bad.
I shouldn't say they're all like that,
but just generally,

255
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.420
generally speaking,
um,
I dunno,

256
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.260
that's just something that happened to me recently.

257
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.890
Just struck me as funny and I was,

258
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.690
I called up via afterwards and I was just going off on it and she was laughing

259
00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:43.450
her ass.
Off I go.
They just,
why are they so fucking rude?

260
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.770
I just don't understand it.

261
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.030
Go fucking go hang out with some beautiful people.
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:51.460
A lovely Jesus Christ.
What the fuck do you want from me?

263
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.050
I didn't ask you to come back here.

264
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.410
I just kept thinking of that Richard Pryor bit.

265
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.900
When he went to the fucking White House,

266
00:15:58.901 --> 00:16:02.680
they invited him to the White House and then they treated them like shit and his

267
00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:04.850
wife's trying to calm him down.
He's in the back room,

268
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.480
you said asked to come to this motherfucker.

269
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.240
It was one of my favorite lines.
He have a,

270
00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:15.670
had I done that has to come to this motherfucker.

271
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.713
<v 3>MMM.</v>

272
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.660
<v 1>Anyways,
I don't even what I'm talking about.
You know what?</v>

273
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:26.210
I got my first advertising of the year.
Holy Shit.

274
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:28.520
I'll tell you I was dying on the vine there for a minute.

275
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:30.683
<v 3>MMM.</v>

276
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.700
<v 1>Maybe cause I say dumb shit like I don't like beautiful women.</v>

277
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:38.360
I have no beautiful women by 40% of our product.
Ah,
right.

278
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.440
Sorry,
that was my password.
All right.
Okay.

279
00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:47.470
Here we go.
Oh look who's back everybody.

280
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.560
Toto toto beyond these no more sweaty balls.

281
00:16:52.561 --> 00:16:55.170
Badu to toe.
Brds beyond these.

282
00:16:55.171 --> 00:16:59.990
Take the bitch to the mall by everything in the fucking stores.

283
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:02.370
She don't care cause she's a hoe.

284
00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:05.130
She's looking for someone with a shiny here car.

285
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.680
This is why I don't watch reality TV.
And it's really my big complaint,
uh,

286
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.240
when Nia watches reality television is because I have major issues with fucking

287
00:17:15.241 --> 00:17:18.810
women that I had been working on for a long fucking time.
And you know,

288
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.120
if you've noticed in my last specials,
I really have stayed away from,
you know,

289
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.960
the epic levels that I've gone to at some point to the point I watched him now

290
00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:30.840
like what the fuck is wrong with me?
Um,

291
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.830
but now she's got me watching this reality show and it's just every fucking

292
00:17:34.831 --> 00:17:39.560
thing,
every paranoia that I have about them,
it's just shown in.

293
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.950
It's,
it's just constant throughout the whole fucking thing.

sleep.

355

If a mattress landed on your tent when she got over,

367
00:22:21.011 --> 00:22:25.540
the fact that the building is sleeping next to and collapse on you.
You know,

368
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.750
I'm talking a mattress,
not a box spring.
I don't want anybody to get hurt here.

369
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.460
He just have it fall down.
And then you just put your tent back together,

370
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.520
you know,
right on top of the mattress.
That'd be the shit,

371
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.020
right?

we really care about you.
You know,

379
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.720
trying to say that I was a fucking alcoholic.
What?

380
00:23:12.721 --> 00:23:14.050
I want to tell you something right now.

381
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:18.280
Friends of Bill W it is July 3rd right?

382

By the time you hear it's going to be July 4th and aloe already gone.

383
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:26.110
Three A's in a fucking row.
All right?
It was on the wagon.

384
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:31.111
431 days jumped off for six glorious fucking days.

385
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.140
Glorious days.
Oh,
it tasted delicious.
Right?

386
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.920
And I'm right back on it.
You know,

387
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.770
God Damn Aa people date,
they don't like that I could do that.

388
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.240
That I can dip in and dip out.
They don't like that.

389
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.340
They think I'm gonna lose my whole life.
And then in,
in the bottle,

390
00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.080
I'm not,
and I'm stopping right now,
you know,
just out of pure vanity,

391
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.310
I just like fucking

392
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.300
not just being a bloated booze bag.

393
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:11.510
That's why you stopped to begin with.
I didn't stop for the right reasons.

394
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.550
I stopped because I didn't want to be a fat fuck.
That's why I stopped.

395
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.990
You know?
I swear to God,
I want to go to a fucking AA meeting.
I want to go down.

396
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:24.830
I'm going to listen to those stories again.
It's fucking,
stories are incredible.

397
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.140
You know,
I can't imagine if quint terantin and went to a fucking Aa meeting,

398
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.420
the movie that that man would right afterwards.

399
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.320
All he's gotta do is listen to their stories.

400
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.940
Throw some karate in there and get Jamie Foxx.

401
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.230
I mean that's how do you not watch that fucking movie and then put it in 70

402
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:43.730
millimeter like he did his last one,

403
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:47.530
the hateful eight and anybody else see the hateful eight and 70 millimeter and

404
00:24:47.531 --> 00:24:51.800
that fucking stage coach came into this with the whole orchestra piece.

405
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:56.090
It was incredible.
One of any writers do that Shit,

406
00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.760
man.
You got to feel bad how he's just going down there.

407
00:24:58.761 --> 00:25:01.010
All those people fucking fucked up their lives.

408
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.580
The misery that they've gone through and you're going down there pretending

409
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:08.120
you're one of them just so you can get some good dialogue for your fucking

410
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:12.590
script and maybe sell something to see.
Wife will quit calling you a loser.

411
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.610
You know,
I don't know if this happens.
I have no idea.

412
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:18.740
I don't know why I'm acting like this is fucking happening.

413
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:22.970
I'm not saying it's happening,
but you know,
would surprise me.

414
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.200
Right.
You know,
it's really surprising me is,
is

415
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.700
the fact that I still have another four and a half fucking minutes to go.

416
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:34.280
And this is one of the few times that I don't have anything to fucking say.

417
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.780
I got one for you.
You know what I did today?
I did Jones.

418
00:25:36.781 --> 00:25:41.540
He's Jukebox on K,
Los Steve Jones from the sex pistols.

419
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.110
I've always been a fan of his,
his radio program.

420
00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:49.100
It's on from 12 to two in the afternoon.
He plays whatever he wants.

421
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:51.890
Sometimes he picks up the guitar and just makes up a song.

422
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.700
He always has great guests and all that type of stuff.

423
00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.800
But I'm an old man,
so I,
I,
I never knew where it was.

424
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.220
I would always find it.
And then I,
you know,

425
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:06.740
I don't know how to set the fucking buttons in my radio,

426
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.420
at least the back in the day.
So I,
I don't know the,
he had a,

427
00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:15.560
he has a great one.
And then the guy from the e street band,
little Stevie,

428
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:21.140
what does his little Stevie's garage,
they just amazing fucking Djs.

429
00:26:21.141 --> 00:26:23.240
And their knowledge of music is incredible.

430
00:26:23.241 --> 00:26:27.650
And the fact that are actually you listening to base you listening to a fucking

431
00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:29.750
rock star playing the music that he enjoys.

432
00:26:29.751 --> 00:26:31.940
This is not a lot of radio shows like that.
You know what I mean?

433
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.060
So I got to go down there today and do it.
And um,

434
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.090
I knew that guy was funny,

435
00:26:38.091 --> 00:26:42.560
but Jesus quite hung out on his show for like 90 minutes.
And uh,

436
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.770
I,
I could barely keep up with the guy,
you know what I mean?

437
00:26:47.771 --> 00:26:50.620
He's not supposed to be standup comedian level funny,
right?

438
00:26:50.621 --> 00:26:52.460
He's supposed to be musician level.
Funny.

439
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.540
It was fucking unbelievable.
Guy Wasn't noble guy was hilarious.

440
00:26:58.541 --> 00:27:03.070
So if you listen to Iop,
listen to it,
um,
I had a great time on that.
And,
um,

441
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.520
I also realized how little I know about music because he plays all this cool

442
00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:13.540
shit,
you know,
and I listened to all the mainstream stuff,
so he was like,

443
00:27:13.541 --> 00:27:17.320
you know,
think,
what did you listen to a w?

444
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.930
I said I was growing up,
I was like,
you know,
hair metal,
heavy metal,

445
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.760
ac DC,
Stevie ray bond.
It's about it.

446
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.840
And then my dad's big band swing,
I don't think he played he,
that shit on here,

447
00:27:31.841 --> 00:27:35.620
dude.
And he's out playing.
So he ended up playing a motley crew,

448
00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.340
uh,
looks at kill and then into ACDC live wire,

449
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.950
which I thought was pretty cool that he did that.

450
00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:45.870
But I was actually kind of nervous that he was going to lose some of his fan

451
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:49.100
base,
like who is this stupid comedian request in the shit?
Um,

452
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.290
but I don't think we got any goddamn complaints.
Um,
you know,

453
00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:58.270
it was cool was he actually had the,
uh,
always at the,
uh,

454
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.160
Chelsea arsenal game on in the background.
And,
um,

455
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.050
I just can not get into that

456
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.700
shit unless I'm over it.
If you're over in England,

457
00:28:10.701 --> 00:28:15.350
it's impossible not to get into it.
Everybody gives a fuck.
Everybody's drinking.

458
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.730
People care.
He tried to get into it over here.
It's so fucking quiet.

459
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.760
You know,
which you want a couple of nerdy friends.

460
00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.800
It's just no fucking place to watch it at that level to get into it.

461
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.400
But at least what you watched the premier league game,
you can hear the crowd,

462
00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:36.140
how much server intuit.
Um,
but like American soccer,

463
00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:40.340
Jesus Christ,
you can ever fucking pin drop.
Um,

464
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.860
unless Mexico's playing and it's out here in la,

465
00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:44.750
then it sounds like this is amazing.

466
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.670
So he had that game on the background and just watching how much he gave a fuck

467
00:28:49.671 --> 00:28:51.980
plus with his accent,
it was the shit.

468
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:56.981
And I got into the game and his team went up a two to one and he was nervous

469
00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:01.820
with 10 minutes left.
And the last thing I said to him was like,
dude,

470
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.710
10 minutes left in a soccer game is like 0.8 seconds left in a fucking hockey

471
00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:09.950
game.
And the pucks on the other end of the Isis,
this game is over.

472
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.900
There's nobody.
It was almost like a rule.

473
00:29:11.901 --> 00:29:15.410
They're not going to score four goals at one soccer game.

474
00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:21.620
So I go home and I'm fucking trying to find the Celtics game tonight.
And I,

475
00:29:21.621 --> 00:29:26.030
I went on Fox sports,
they were talking about the game.

476
00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.500
It fucking arsenal came back and scored a goal some out in the last 10 minutes.

477
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:35.510
So it was to,
to,
to,
to ended up in a tie.
I think I jinxed it.
So my apologies.

478
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.150
Um,
but you know what?

479
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:41.570
I've always been trying to have a fucking team when I was over and I knew there

480
00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:44.990
was no way I could root for man United because that's like when I go over to

481
00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:48.280
England,
I see somebody with a fucking Yankee hat on.
It's like,
ah,

482
00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:52.970
you fucking mouth breathing can't,
why are you a Yankee fan?

483
00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.290
Why?
Who could do one new mode?

484
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.240
It's the only fucking team I know the fuck Outta here.

485
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.820
I want to go over there and see somebody with a blue Jay hat on is some shit

486
00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:06.700
like that.
So like there's no fucking way I can,
I can do that.
So,
uh,

487
00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.180
I've been trying to pick a team over there and maybe I'll,

488
00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:14.990
maybe I'll follow Chelsea.
I have no idea.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

489
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:20.240
All I know is it's late at night and I'm,
Oh my God,

490
00:30:20.241 --> 00:30:22.790
I wish I saw that text earlier.
Somebody just fucking texted me.

491
00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:24.410
You going out tonight cigar.

492
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.940
Oh,
that would be tremendous.
Um,

493
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.880
I'm trying to cut down on those fucking thanks to just,

494
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.910
maybe it's good that I didn't see it.
I'm actually going to,

495
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.540
I'm going to try and live the rest of this month the way I lived when I was

496
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:44.920
eight.
All right.
Which is basically no booze,

497
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.720
no fucking porno,
no cigars.

498
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:55.330
You know,
I'll go buy a bicycle pretending I have a paper route again.

499
00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.780
Um,
I dunno,
I'm fucking enjoying the,
uh,

500
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:06.390
the clean living and then every once in a while fucking a little debauchery.

501
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.530
Maybe I'll do that.

502
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.040
I'll be fine.
I'll go off for six weeks on for four days.

503
00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.360
That wouldn't be bad.
Right?
Would that be bad for your liver?
Um,

504
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.280
the thing is I have too much expensive boots here and I can't just leave it

505
00:31:25.281 --> 00:31:29.540
there and I'm not giving it away.
At some point,
I got to fucking drink it right

506
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.100
by pill.
You know what?
We don't give a fuck about you and your stupid boots.

507
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.660
All right,
I get it.
I'm done talking about it.
Um,
all right,

508
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.930
that's the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

509
00:31:41.931 --> 00:31:44.300
I hope you're having a great,
what are your New Year's resolutions?

510
00:31:44.301 --> 00:31:47.490
What are you doing?
You know what I'm trying again,

511
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.530
that I've failed with all the fucking time is I'm trying to get back to become

512
00:31:51.531 --> 00:31:55.250
fluent in French again.
I'm back on that dual lingo,

513
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.720
fucking trying and out again.
I got the flashcards.

514
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:04.310
I got all of that shit.
I need a French friend.

515
00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.990
You know,
someone who just fucking hang out and talk to me.
Look,

516
00:32:08.991 --> 00:32:13.670
I'm a baby in French.
You know,
the way my kids can learn English,

517
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.060
they think got to teach it that way,
you know,
and you know what it is.

518
00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:21.250
There's been enough people going,
dude,
you never going to learn that shit.
Um,

519
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:24.860
that's the only way I learned shit is it someone's?
Yeah,

520
00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:27.290
you're never going to do that.
Then I'm like,
I had,
fuck you,
I'm going to do it.

521
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.650
But if they say,
oh yeah,
he should have no problem,

522
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.280
then I blow it off and all right,
fuck it up.
One of the other,
I don't know.

523
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.520
It feels like a fucking therapy session.
Um,
all right.
That's it.

524
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:45.380
I get nothing.
I got nothing for you.
I got no gigs is fucking month.

525
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.180
I might be doing something.

526
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.380
I might be doing a show in San Francisco cause I'm going up there.

527
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:54.830
Kevin Pollock for sketch fest.
I'm going up there and I don't,
I don't know,

528
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.120
doing something with him at one in the afternoon at the Castro theater,

529
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.900
which I believe is on the 15th,

530
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.670
the 15th in fucking January.
Hold on a second.
Let me see if this is right.

531
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.370
Let me see.
Let me see the 13th.

532
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:18.410
It's on the 13th.
Um,
and I might,

533
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.340
I might be doing a couple shows at cops that night.

534
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:23.780
I'm trying to see if that's going to happen.

535
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.020
I probably shouldn't have said that because it just falls through.

536
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.970
Then they're gonna be like,
what the fuck?
She's doing a born pocketbook.
Um,

537
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:35.650
all right.
That's it.
Enjoy the music and the new bull play another half hour,

538
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.080
greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon podcasts from a Thursday.
I Dunno,

539
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.630
early this year from years ago.

540
00:33:41.631 --> 00:33:45.380
I have no fucking idea and maybe I'll lose another fence because they say

541
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:47.520
something about Jesus.
All right.
See Ya.

542
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:04.270
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

543
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.050
what about my week?

544
00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.300
<v 6>I had a fucking insane week and</v>

545
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.620
I went to the rose bowl with a fellow comedian and uh,

546
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.110
I'm not gonna name his name.
Usually I'll do that.
Maybe to give somebody,

547
00:35:43.111 --> 00:35:46.200
you know,
bump up their friends or that type of stuff,

548
00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:50.070
which I'd love to do for this guy,
but not behavior was so,

549
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.420
uh,
colorful.

550
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.320
That's the word I'll use that you know,
just in case,
you know what I mean?

551
00:35:58.321 --> 00:35:59.610
I'm old school.
I don't name names.

552
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:02.520
When I started talking about a semi crimes that I committed,

553
00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.820
not really committing,
well I guess being drunk in public is a crime bill.

554
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.240
Why don't you shut the fuck up and get to the story and we'll,
I'll be the judge.

555
00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:13.950
Fine.
Fine.
Okay.
You guys with all the tension beginning of 2009 you know,

556
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.820
so you guys be more relaxed this year.
You know,

557
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:22.790
things going to be fat and 2009 maybe,
although they gotta rhyme,

558
00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.550
you know,
just make it rhyme and then,
then,
then,
then I'm supposed to feel good.

559
00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:29.220
You know,
and I'm not supposed to notice that last year it was,

560
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:33.160
things are going to be great in 2008 and now you've,
you've knocked it down,

561
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.720
announce things,
it'll be fine things.
It'd be great man.
I think to be fine.

562
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.373
You know,

563
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.870
don't freak out in 2010 Ooh.
Did they combine this with Canada in 2011

564
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:51.750
why am I fucking checking myself out at a grocery store and I'm not getting paid

565
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:56.010
for it?
Okay,
so my name is,

566
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:59.970
I go to the rose bowl with a comedian.
We're just going to call him Joe.

567
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.150
All right.
Cause that's the classic alias name.

568
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.360
When you don't want to get somebody in trouble,
you just call him Joe.

569
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:09.960
But the ironic thing is this guy's name is actually gel.

570
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.081
So me and Joe,

571
00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:15.990
we go to the a fellow comedian and now you can try and figure out who the fuck

572
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:20.930
he is and it's not fiscal.
Paul.
Um,
we go to the Rose Bowl and,
uh,

573
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.420
we had great intentions.
Okay.
And let me paint a picture for you.
Okay.

574
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.590
When you go to the rose bowl,

575
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.070
it's one of the great tailgating experiences you'll ever have.
First of all,

576
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:31.470
you go to the Rose Bowl.
Okay?

577
00:37:31.471 --> 00:37:36.080
The granddaddy of them all home have a bunch of Superbowls Superbowls with fully

578
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.650
that,
that Super Bowl,
uh,

579
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.450
if you see that famous Lynn Swann catch that wasn't made there actually realized

580
00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:46.470
that was made at Temple University,
wasn't it?
I don't fucking know.

581
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.740
There's been a oh nine,
although the Jackie Slater one where he dropped the ball,

582
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:53.310
that's right.
That that cowboy Steelers won the greatest fucking,

583
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.190
I dunno,
clash of two powerhouse teams I ever saw was the,

584
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:01.860
uh,
I dunno,
whatever.
They played a bunch of fucking things there.

585
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:04.020
And I don't have the information in front of me and I'm really killing the

586
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:08.240
momentum of the story.
So anyways,
he go there,
right.
And uh,

587
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:13.250
you get right behind the Rosebowl is what I'm assuming is an 18 hole golf

588
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:15.984
course.

589
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.460
Cause God knows that's how big it felt at the end of the game when I was two

590
00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:22.950
shit faced and we couldn't find the car and we walked for four.

591
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.340
But that,
that I'm getting ahead of myself.
You know what I'm foreshadowing,

592
00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:31.320
I'm doing what all great movies.
Do you know what I mean?

593
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.410
You go see a movie whenever they show a movie about a guy who dies,

594
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.910
everybody he's going to die.
So they show them,

595
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:40.390
died in the beginning and then the next thing is they go back to his childhood.

596
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.680
You know what I mean?
Except they never do that with the Elvis movie.

597
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:49.060
Cause then I'd have to start the movie with some fat fuck dying on a toilet and

598
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:52.720
no one wants to do that.
I'll do as well.

599
00:38:55.220 --> 00:39:00.070
Is that my pancreas?
PLOP.
Um,
anyways,

600
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.450
so Jesus Christ,
let's get some momentum here.
So we fucking,

601
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.590
we go to this tailgate.
All right,
and this is the deal.
Basically,

602
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:12.460
there's just two of us and amongst us,
we have four hamburger patties,

603
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:17.140
two bags of chips,
hamburger buns,
12 pack of Bud Light,

604
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:19.900
12 pack of Budweiser,

605
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.630
and a Clint Eastwood canteens,

606
00:39:23.631 --> 00:39:26.320
size of fucking crown royal,

607
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.150
and to Cuban cigars that I snuck back from fucking Canada.

608
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:36.490
So we're ready to go.
I got my sunblock,
we loaded up into the Prius,

609
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.120
which is,
uh,
which was just fucking hilarious.
You know,
everybody,

610
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.600
everybody tries to outman people at the,
uh,
at the tailgates,

611
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.390
people coming up there with,
they have their fucking,
you know,

612
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:49.900
for two or pickups with the lift kits,
you know,

613
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.030
the generators.
It's of fucking satellite dish in a flat screen TV.

614
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.350
You know,
I came there with a little Hibachi,
but whatever.

615
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.560
We had the big thing of crown royal,
so people and Cuban cigars.

616
00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:05.230
So no one fucked with us,
right?
So we're having a great time.

617
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.670
All of a sudden this lady comes walking by and she's like,
Hey,

618
00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:12.460
do you want to buy a little ticket holder for your ticket?
I'm like,

619
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:16.750
absolutely sweetheart,
10 bucks a whack.
Let me get,
let me get that.

620
00:40:16.751 --> 00:40:19.780
Two Times they had baby,
you know,
you've got a cigar in your mouth,

621
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:21.040
you start getting a little swagger.

622
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.590
Some reason when he likes starts rocking back and forth,

623
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:27.460
like you've got to sing it.
Like you got to singing Elvis song.
I was failing it.

624
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.180
And the great thing was I didn't give a fuck about either team USC,

625
00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.630
all Penn State.
I was just happy to fucking be there,
you know?

626
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.170
But I quickly realized most people were for the Trojans.

627
00:40:38.171 --> 00:40:42.190
So automatically I'm a con second come to the year.
I'm like,
you know what,

628
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:42.970
I'm going to root for the,

629
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:47.110
I'm a roof of Penn state because this gives me way more chance to annoy people.

630
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:52.090
Plus I,
I've never liked USC and uh,
most of it has to do with back in the day,

631
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:56.620
I used to be a Notre Dame fan before Lou Holtz.
What?
They're holier,

632
00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.090
holier than thou.
We don't do steroids.
Shut the fuck up.
Yes you do.
All right.

633
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.310
I had acne when I was fucking a teenager.
Right?
But it wasn't all over my back.

634
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:09.580
And I also couldn't pick up a house.
Okay,
so you fucking,

635
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:13.120
people are doing steroids anyways.
And also,

636
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:14.620
I always hated the Trojans fight song.

637
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.060
They play it every three seconds bad that an ad that,
you know,

638
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.420
they came like half a yard.

639
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.860
And it also reminds me of Fleetwood Mac who I never liked.
So fuck the Trojans,

640
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:26.650
right?
So anyway,
so we're sitting there,
we're drinking,
we're partying,

641
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:29.230
would eat burgers and a,

642
00:41:29.231 --> 00:41:32.770
then we break out the crown royal after we had polished off a good half a case

643
00:41:32.771 --> 00:41:35.150
between two of us,
it's probably nine 30 in the morning.

644
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.510
And we just started pounding this crown royal,

645
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:42.920
which is going down like fucking Koolaid.
I was really impressed with my ability,

646
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:48.350
or at least the,
the makers of crown royal,
that is some smooth shit.
So,

647
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:48.741
uh,

648
00:41:48.741 --> 00:41:53.741
so basically we start walking towards the stadium and the alcohol's flowing

649
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:58.340
through me and that's when I go into my transformation.

650
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.310
I don't know what happens to me at sporting events,

651
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:04.630
but instantly I just become the loud guy.
I feel like I'm,

652
00:42:04.631 --> 00:42:05.870
I'm doing a comedy show.

653
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.400
I want to make the people around me laugh and I also want to irritate as many

654
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:11.720
fucking people as I can.

655
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:17.000
So I start walking in there and I quickly notice,
um,

656
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.970
well I know I went to go buy a program,

657
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.870
I'm trying to put this all back together cause I was pretty drunk.
I go,

658
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.900
just to give you an idea of,
of the mood that I was in,

659
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.930
I get to about a hundred yards from the stadium.

660
00:42:29.931 --> 00:42:34.600
This lady's selling programs and she's like,
yeah,
I get you probe the ad pack.

661
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.000
America gets a bar graphs and like I fuck it.
I want to,
I want a souvenir.

662
00:42:38.001 --> 00:42:41.780
So I walk up and Mike,
how much are they?
She's like,
10 bucks,
my guy.
Fine.

663
00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:45.560
So this other guy comes walking up to cause so much for the programs and the

664
00:42:45.561 --> 00:42:48.200
Lady's like 10 bucks,
right?

665
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:52.610
And the guy starts bitching to be right.
So I'm standing there,

666
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:57.230
I got a Cuban cigar.
I go,
you know what,
let me get another one,
two times.

667
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.590
Let me get two of those.
All right,
one for you over there.
And the guy's like,

668
00:43:00.591 --> 00:43:05.030
really?
I go,
Hey,
I go take a look at me.
They know,
you know you're looking at,

669
00:43:05.031 --> 00:43:07.700
you're looking at a big shot.
Take a good look.
There's not a,

670
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.630
there's not a lot of us left.
I swear to God,
I said that and I was so drunk.

671
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.880
I was only half joking.

672
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.450
Like I knew I was being an asshole,
but like I was only half Gif.

673
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.630
Fucking Cuban gone.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'm a big shot.

674
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.850
Let's get a program for this fag over here.

675
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.840
Who's bitching about 10 pool goes to the Rose Bowl and bitches about a $10

676
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:31.760
fucking program.
You know what I mean?

677
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.570
He should have been de pants and he should have his tickets removed right there

678
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.330
and send right back to wherever the fuck you keep key came from.

679
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.850
Sent to an apple.
Watch the game there.
All right.
Kind of fucking behaviors.

680
00:43:43.851 --> 00:43:47.210
That is the granddaddy of them all.
Thank you.

681
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:50.330
Fucking money out and play the Goddamn game.
All right.

682
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.850
So when he went and saw him Hammock,
right?
And we're fucking,

683
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:55.100
we're walking and uh,

684
00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:59.240
I don't know what happened when we got into the stadium.
Everything was cool.

685
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:02.090
And then they have this weird sort of like they funnel you in,

686
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.630
cause it's a really old stadium.
It's like,

687
00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.240
you know it's like trying to go through the Lincoln tunnel like five o'clock at

688
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:10.220
night.
It's a pain in the ass.
So I'm standing there,

689
00:44:10.221 --> 00:44:13.490
I'm getting frustrated because it's getting close to kickoff and I hate missing

690
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:17.420
kickoff.
So I'm getting pissed.
And I noticed that the Penn state fans,

691
00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:20.390
they've got this chant where one of them,
I don't know where it just yells,

692
00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:24.170
we are.
And then all the Penn state fans go,
patch stayed.

693
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.750
And then the dude yells again we are and they'll go Penn state and they say it

694
00:44:28.751 --> 00:44:33.120
like five times and then the end,
the guy who starts the chant goes thank you.

695
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.180
And then everybody screams yo welcome.

696
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:40.670
And I immediately noticed that it annoyed the shit out of all these USC fence.

697
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.451
You know,

698
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:44.850
cause they kind of felt like it was a home game cause they were out there.

699
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.690
So next thing you know,
I didn't even think it.
Next thing you know,

700
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:53.190
coming out of my mouth,
I'm going,
we are.
I'm not here,

701
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:55.650
I'm not from Penn state.
I don't know Shit,
right?
But I just start going,

702
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:58.020
we got everything starts going Penn state,

703
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:04.170
Penn state,
and I'm like,
thank you.
And they're like,
Yo,
welcome.
I'm like,

704
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:05.310
this is fucking awesome.

705
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.570
I can do this the whole game and annoy the shit out of people around me.

706
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.190
So like it took us 20 minutes,

707
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.180
20 minutes to get through the tunnel and I sweated.
I was like,

708
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:21.390
perfect timing light.
As we got through the tunnel,

709
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.080
this check is finishing singing the national anthem as we just take in the

710
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:30.990
Roseville on a sunny California day,

711
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.220
everybody's wearing their Trojan colors.
Everybody's wearing that Penn state.

712
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:40.160
There's pompoms.
People are going fucking nuts.
And this lady's like,
Eh,

713
00:45:40.161 --> 00:45:43.170
no home of the brave.
And what is,

714
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:45.960
she finished a fucking stealth bomber.

715
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:51.180
Flies right over the God damn top.
I'm shit face.
It's like a fucking acid trip.

716
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:56.340
I almost passed out.
Right?
So now,
you know,
we've got end zone seats,

717
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.610
you know,
evidently I'm not a big shot and we'll wait at the top of the stadium,

718
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.390
which is a really rough thing to negotiate when you're a redhead drinking

719
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:04.560
whiskey in the sun,
right?

720
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:11.970
We get all the way up to like row whatever fucking triple f and you know it's an

721
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:16.200
old stadium.
Okay.
And you know,
back in the day,
like you were tall if you will,

722
00:46:16.201 --> 00:46:19.620
like five foot six when the stadium was built.
And now you know,

723
00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:22.500
with fucking growth hormones and all the preservatives in the food,

724
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:24.390
we basically outgrown the stadium's,

725
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:27.810
not to mention the cheesecake factories that have these fucking people go to

726
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:31.950
every other day.
So I'm trying to walk a tight rope down.

727
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.230
I'm really acting this out of my bedroom by the way.

728
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:35.970
This is how into these stories I get to tell.

729
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:40.950
So I'm literally walking a fucking tight rope trying to get down to my seat and

730
00:46:40.951 --> 00:46:44.700
I just become that guy.
I felt I didn't fall.

731
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:49.790
I sorta like like list.
It was like almost like I was on his show.

732
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.240
I was the only guy in a ship that was in a fucking with perfect storm and all of

733
00:46:54.241 --> 00:46:59.241
a sudden the whole thing just lifted to the right side and I landed on this like

734
00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:03.870
55 year old ladies back.
Didn't like land like I was doing.

735
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.780
I was on one foot and I put a nice forearm,

736
00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:11.850
oh I'll Samuelson in front of the net fucking action right on her back and I was

737
00:47:11.851 --> 00:47:13.350
so drunk it took me,

738
00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:18.351
I swear to God that at least 28 seconds to get off or in the entire time I am

739
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:23.691
apologizing with my fucking cigar whiskey breaths,

740
00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.570
this gun on site
and I just,

741
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.590
I couldn't get off it cause I the only way to get off or was to put all my

742
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:36.850
weight on my forearm and use her as a Bannister to push me back up because

743
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:40.510
nobody's fucking helping me because I'm obviously the drunk guy.

744
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:41.380
You don't want to touch me.

745
00:47:41.381 --> 00:47:46.381
So 28 seconds to trying to figure out if I have the quad strength to pull myself

746
00:47:47.351 --> 00:47:50.350
up without pushing off the back of this old lady's neck.

747
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.760
I finally just say fuck it and just drive my,
the Meta,

748
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:59.590
my forearm right between her shoulder blades and I get up and I apologize

749
00:47:59.591 --> 00:48:04.060
profusely and I don't know what Joe was doing at this point.

750
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.000
He was fucking probably just standing there watching the game.

751
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.850
But basically we finally get to our seats.
It was unreal.

752
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.670
I didn't know what,
we got to our seats and I,
we turn around,

753
00:48:15.671 --> 00:48:20.020
we faced the game to watch the game and next thing you know this lady is just

754
00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:21.160
screaming at us.

755
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:26.350
She's like screaming and she's yelling,

756
00:48:26.351 --> 00:48:29.350
you can't smoke in here.
And I'm like,
what the fuck is she talking about?

757
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.210
Because I put my my cigar out.

758
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.910
I'm going to tell you do the fucking Cuban is sweet too,
man.

759
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:36.070
I smoked that thing all the way down like a Goddamn Roach.

760
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:40.210
It's like burning my fucking fingers and she's yelling,
stop smoking.

761
00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:43.660
I'm like the fuck she talking about do I smell like a cigar?
And I tell him,

762
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:44.440
I looked,

763
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.090
I looked to my right and Joe is standing there with the fucking Cuban cigars.

764
00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:53.680
Gus still lit in his mouth.
I don't know how the fuck he got a past security.

765
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.490
I think it's,
cause we had our tickets,
those tickets,

766
00:48:56.491 --> 00:49:00.820
things I bought around our neck.
I don't know if he had it down by his side,

767
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:05.650
but he's sitting at chomp on it like fucking Archie bunker.
So

768
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.960
you know,
in the sense of me,
if she just turned around and she had just said,

769
00:49:10.961 --> 00:49:13.630
hey guys,
um,
you know that,
you know,
I don't know if you know,

770
00:49:13.631 --> 00:49:16.480
but there's no smoking in here.
Yeah,
I would have been,
you know,

771
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.050
I'm a happy trunk.
I swear to God.
I'm angry when I'm sober,
but I it,

772
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.570
I'm a happy drunk.
I just would've been like,
hey,
aside bought that,

773
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.420
we didn't know.
Oh,
what do you feel?
Let's see.
All right,
good luck.
Bye.
Ha Ha,

774
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.800
whatever.
I would've kept it at that,
but she fucking was yelling at us.

775
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.840
So I don't like being yelled at.
And I like being,

776
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:39.030
I like fucking with people and I'm shit faced and Joe is of the same ilk and

777
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.970
then that's when it all started.
She just based,
she's like,

778
00:49:45.971 --> 00:49:48.220
Hey,
she goes,
there's no smoking in here.

779
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:53.080
And then immediately I just go and I just go.
I'm just like,
Hey,

780
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:57.730
said.
So she goes to California and I just smoke indoors.

781
00:49:57.731 --> 00:50:02.230
We're like,
we're outside.
And she goes,
you're not allowed to smoke it.
And I go,

782
00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:06.310
you're not my mother.
This isn't our section.
This is in your section turnaround.

783
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.340
Right.
I just kept being an asshole.
And then finally she goes,

784
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.720
I'm going to call security.
And I'm like,
call them.
She goes,

785
00:50:13.721 --> 00:50:17.320
I'm going to call him.
I go,
go ahead and call them.
And then in my head,

786
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:22.240
my brain is going,
Bill,
shut up,
shut up.

787
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.490
You're going to get,
we're 90 seconds into the game,

788
00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.860
you're going to get kicked out.
And I just couldn't stop myself.

789
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.250
I just kept saying column,
column and then,

790
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:36.590
then she made some sort of comment,
I think about the size of Joe's knows,

791
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.530
and then he said,
hey,
he goes,

792
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.850
you need to lose a hundred pounds to talk to me,
bitch.
He said,

793
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:52.190
the guy to the left of us turns around and he's like,
Hey,

794
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:57.330
I got my kid,
I got my kid here.
What do you curse again?

795
00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.410
And then Joe goes,
well then don't bring them to a fucking football.

796
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.460
So now I'm doing that laugh.

797
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:08.570
You know that laugh where like your mouth is wide open but there's no air coming

798
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:13.370
in or out.
I'm having a time of my life and then the fucking guy goes,

799
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.380
he goes,
I'm going to call security.
And then I'm just,
then at once again,

800
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:23.410
I'm going,
I'm going to call it God and Call Up Collin.

801
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.320
I was just calling that bluff because we were so fucking jam packed and I knew

802
00:51:27.321 --> 00:51:29.120
they weren't going to walk down there and go do that.

803
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.080
So that lady makes another fucking comment.

804
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:37.490
At which point Joe makes another comment about her weight and then she just

805
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:42.200
turns down and it's like mark and yells down to a husband and next thing you

806
00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:46.510
know this fucking dude comes running over and he starts screaming at us and he's

807
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.960
screaming at us.
This spray is coming out of his mouth all over his wife.

808
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:55.130
So it was easy.
I was just going,
sir,
sir,

809
00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:59.720
you're spitting on your wife.
And once you know,
that whole thing was pathetic.

810
00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:04.440
He was like 53 but like,
and I'm 40 and I'm thinking like that.

811
00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:08.690
I'm not too old to fight this guy.
You know,
it was just,
Oh God,

812
00:52:08.691 --> 00:52:11.150
I'm trying to pieces together.
And then so when we all sit down,
right?

813
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:14.510
So then we sit down.
I think Joe had put out the cigar.

814
00:52:14.511 --> 00:52:16.900
Maybe he's was just holding it down.
I don't know what was coming,

815
00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.860
but now by this time we'd already missed the kickoff.

816
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:27.050
The Trojan's get the ball and I think this is the basically the one good play

817
00:52:27.051 --> 00:52:31.340
Penn state made all day.
They Trojans their first plan.
Thanks offense.

818
00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:35.960
They handed off the ball and they tried to do like some sort of sweep the Penn

819
00:52:35.961 --> 00:52:38.810
state defense strung out and just stuck.

820
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:42.800
This guy he did for no gain or like lots of one yard.

821
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.570
And then Joe,
cool.
I forgot to mention is a good six foot four.

822
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.680
Just a huge guy.

823
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:54.100
Just starts screaming like an inch from the back of the Lady's head who's a

824
00:52:54.741 --> 00:52:59.390
Trojan Fan.
He just starts screaming like,
Nah,
Nah,

825
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.850
Nah,
I can't believe like her hair wasn't moving.

826
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:09.250
He was yelling so loud and then she,
I know she turned around and shit.

827
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.040
How that shit,
Nah,
Shit.
That shit.
It was,
it was quite,

828
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:14.960
it was fucking great.

829
00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:17.870
And then basically what would have for the rest of the game,

830
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:22.550
shit would calm down and then we would,
we would,

831
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:23.361
I don't know,

832
00:53:23.361 --> 00:53:27.030
we would mumble something about her and then she would fucking yell down to a

833
00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:31.830
husband and then he'd come over threatening to kick our ass and we would just

834
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:36.090
laugh at them.
And then,
I dunno,
I just realized I was so drunk,

835
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.210
I can't even remember the rest of,
I remember it was the very end of the game,

836
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.980
uh,
somebody,
Joe,

837
00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:47.850
somebody said something about the score and then the lady in front of us goes,

838
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:50.370
yeah,
I'm surprised you can count that high.
I go,
yeah,

839
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:54.420
why don't you try counting calories,
right?
Something real mean like that.

840
00:53:54.421 --> 00:53:57.340
And then once again,
she's like Mk.
And then at this point,

841
00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.610
half the crowd in left because it was such a blow out.

842
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:03.120
This too comes over and he starts fucking screaming at me.

843
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.540
It doesn't scream at Joe because Joe is six foot four.

844
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:10.590
He yells at me cause I'm fucking barely five 10 and I'm a fucking redhead.
Right.

845
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.320
Even with the shaved head,
I still look like fucking howdy doody.

846
00:54:13.321 --> 00:54:16.080
So he starts yelling at me and he keeps telling me,

847
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.270
yeah I'm going to fire you down on the field.

848
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.390
That's why he kept saying tell me he's going to grab me and fire me down on the

849
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:26.130
fucking field.
And I was just,
you know,
and I was just being an asshole.

850
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.270
Good,
good.
Do it.
I'm going to fight and built.
You said that,

851
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:34.500
you already said that.
You already said you already said it.
You fucking cunt.

852
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.600
Right.
If you've got to do it,

853
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.320
you would have and you didn't see you not to sit down and shut the fuck up.

854
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.420
Which is funny because by the end of the game,

855
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:47.910
everyone in the stands somehow liked us and hated those people.

856
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.840
I mean path of it was cause they were assholes.
The other half was,

857
00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:54.960
they couldn't hear the shit that we will mumble him at.
This dude's wife,

858
00:54:56.870 --> 00:55:00.350
I know at this point he might have a little bit of sympathy for it,

859
00:55:00.351 --> 00:55:03.210
but I mean I'm telling you she was,
she was,
uh,

860
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.420
she was an asshole and she's the one who made it personal first.

861
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:09.730
She made the comment about Joe's knows she,
uh,

862
00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.470
she was doing real hacky lines too.
She's told me I was ugly.

863
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:17.100
She goes and I always can lose weight,
you know,
which,
uh,

864
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:22.080
I believe I saw during the second season of def jam and um,
you know,

865
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.071
and I thought,

866
00:55:23.071 --> 00:55:26.580
well we will come in with was a lot more clever and if it was a battle of the

867
00:55:26.581 --> 00:55:30.840
bands in a standup situation,
I think we want.
So,
uh,

868
00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:35.790
basically what ended up happening,
I know this is a long ass fucking story.

869
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:40.050
I don't even have time for questions this week,
but long story short,

870
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:45.330
we ended up walking out.
Um,
I want,

871
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:48.270
I believe that somehow the lady in front of us to who was being a jerk had a

872
00:55:48.271 --> 00:55:52.230
bunch of these ducks streaks on the back of a shirt towards the end of it.

873
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:57.230
I don't know what it was and almost look like a ashes from a cigar.

874
00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:01.320
But um,
I know that that didn't happen because there's no smoking in there.

875
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:05.820
But anyways,
we go to leave and we're basically so drunk.

876
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.880
I don't know man.
It took us like fucking nine hours,

877
00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.550
literally took us 15 minutes to find our car and I think it was calmer for being

878
00:56:14.551 --> 00:56:18.120
such assholes in,
in,
in,
in the stadium.

879
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:22.130
And I don't,
I don't know who the fuck set up the parking lot,

880
00:56:22.131 --> 00:56:23.680
the things out there,
but they basically,

881
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:28.710
the way they do the sections on this golf course is they have like balloons that

882
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:32.290
they just have numbers,
number one,
number two,
number three.

883
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.500
But they're not lit up.
So you can't really seem at night.

884
00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:39.250
So you walk out of the stadium drunk and you look up and you see,

885
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:44.020
I saw the number to where we were,
where we were parked and,
but you know,

886
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:46.990
you've got to follow the path because you can't walk through the sand traps and

887
00:56:46.991 --> 00:56:49.720
shit like that.
So you look down for half a second,

888
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:53.200
then you look up and there's like a big fucking oak tree in front of you and now

889
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:54.100
you don't know where you are.

890
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:57.970
It's like the end of the shining without the shrubs.
It's a fucking golf course,

891
00:56:57.971 --> 00:56:59.290
right?
So,

892
00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:04.090
and you far enough away from the stadium where you can't get your bearings and

893
00:57:04.091 --> 00:57:07.450
were just wandering around and around and around.

894
00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.670
And it's getting to the point like,
you know,

895
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.390
like hypothermia is becoming an issue because it's a desert.

896
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:17.770
It starts getting cold,
was shit faced and we just can't find a car.

897
00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:19.510
It was like the Blair witch.

898
00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:23.830
We kept coming back to the same God damn ladies' teas,
wherever the fuck we were.

899
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:28.180
And then I lost all confidence in my ability to find the damn car.

900
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:32.390
So I started following Joe who was convinced,
even though we both know we're,

901
00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:36.190
we're parked in section two,
we went from section three,

902
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.630
section four to section five,

903
00:57:37.631 --> 00:57:41.380
and he keeps telling me to go in that direction because for some reason he

904
00:57:41.381 --> 00:57:44.530
thinks numerically it's going to go three,
four,
five to,

905
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:50.100
I dunno,
it took us an hour to find the fucking car.
And uh,

906
00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:53.740
at that point I started sobering up and I started thinking about our behavior

907
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:57.880
and I was starting to thinking like,
you know,
I kinda Kinda filling an asshole.

908
00:57:58.330 --> 00:57:59.320
Yeah.
You know,

909
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.960
I shouldn't say I shouldn't taken the higher ground even though they throw was a

910
00:58:01.961 --> 00:58:05.740
content,
you know.
And he was just like,
what are you talking about?

911
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.360
What are you talking about?
She was a cunt.

912
00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:14.470
We treated it like one and that's it.
It's quite a lot about that guy.
He just,

913
00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:18.880
he just breaks it down to the simplest fucking point.

914
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:21.230
Hey Buddy,
I've got my kid hit.
Well,

915
00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:24.100
don't take your kid to a fucking football game.
Which,
you know,

916
00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:27.310
I know that's harsh,
especially if you have kids.
But think about it.

917
00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.073
Think about it.

918
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.680
Why would you bring your kid to was professional to sporting event.

919
00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.520
Not only that,

920
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:37.480
that the guy with the kid is being hypocritical because he was me before he had

921
00:58:37.481 --> 00:58:40.600
a kid.
All right?
He was having the time of his fucking life and what now?

922
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:43.060
Because he has a kid now all of a sudden I'm supposed to,

923
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:46.900
I'm supposed to fucking act my age.
You know,

924
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:48.760
it's like the fucking baby boom generation.

925
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:52.480
They Bang so much the fucking in the mud at Woodstock that by the time I come

926
00:58:52.481 --> 00:58:55.810
around there's herpes and aids and all this shit and then these,
you know,

927
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:59.380
and then they come around with their don't do drugs where a condom shit after

928
00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:00.940
they had the time of their fucking lives.

929
00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:04.900
I'm so glad all of them are getting that whole generation is getting hip

930
00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:08.530
replacements now with their fucking cause.

931
00:59:08.531 --> 00:59:10.180
They all had that fucking Olivia Newton,

932
00:59:10.181 --> 00:59:14.260
John High impact aerobics tape that they did try to stay in shape.

933
00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:16.510
It's the one good fucking thing.

934
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:20.290
Consider I got to fuck with a God damn trash bag around my dick my entire
career.

935
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:25.040
Right.
The very least,
I at least knew to stretch before you lifted weights.

936
00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:29.750
And I also dangers of high impact aerobics.
Okay.
When I did my aerobics,

937
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:32.330
I definitely was rocking the leg warmers,

938
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:36.470
but I did not let my feet leave the ground.
Okay.

939
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:41.020
So anyways,
so that's my rose bowl story.
Um,

940
00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:45.200
it's a fucking law when I know that,
but I think it had some nice moments.
But um,

941
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:49.430
yeah.
But getting back to that,
what do you guys think about that stuff?
You know,

942
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:55.340
sporting events are not for children.
Okay.

943
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.280
And I know they always try to talk about the good old days of sports.

944
00:59:58.281 --> 01:00:01.610
The goal days of sports is bullshit.
Okay.

945
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.990
When I was a kid,
first football game I went to,
I was fucking terrified.

946
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.500
I was terrified.
It was not a place for kids.

947
01:00:09.501 --> 01:00:13.050
It was a place for adults who hadn't achieved what they thought they were gonna

948
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:16.390
achieve in life to get their fucking anger and frustration out.

949
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.110
People with in loveless marriages,
you know,
people,

950
01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:21.944
you know,

951
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.760
people who could tell they were going to get laid off the next week or maybe the

952
01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:29.780
audio got laid off and they just wanted to get it out.
Okay.
And they,
you know,

953
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:33.650
they've now turned going to a fucking football game into like,

954
01:00:33.651 --> 01:00:37.190
you're standing in line with a bunch of people waiting to get their kids,

955
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.850
you know,
photo taken with Santa Claus.
You know,

956
01:00:40.851 --> 01:00:43.790
and even if you go further back than my childhood,
which was seventies,

957
01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:45.500
early eighties,
um,

958
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.010
do you go back to the 1950s they talk about that?
Oh,

959
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:51.920
the good old days of sports or what do you mean what,
what,
when,
uh,

960
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.920
when they finally let a black guy playing baseball and they said,

961
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:57.920
we'll fucking black cat on the field and all that racist shit that was going on.

962
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.210
Can you imagine the shit that was getting yelled in the stands when Billy

963
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:05.150
crystal was going down to la to go ahead and go watch the mic.

964
01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.840
Oil Boy had got myself a hot dog and assessed Barilla.
You know,

965
01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:12.230
they always tell us stories about how great it was back then.
It wasn't,

966
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:17.030
it wasn't great.
They were way more racist,
way more ignorant,
way more sexist.

967
01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.480
And people went to the games and they saw Johnny Unitas.
Okay,

968
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.270
so now for some reason,

969
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:26.780
now it's my turn to be an asshole and it'd be a drunk and have a good time and

970
01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:30.800
all of a sudden I have to take everything down a level,
you know,
not now.

971
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.370
Now it's,
it's Chuckie cheese time.
It isn't.
And I know you guys are saying,

972
01:01:34.371 --> 01:01:37.640
well that's because you don't have a kid right now.
No,
fuck that.
Fuck that.

973
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.370
I wouldn't bring my kid to the game.
Or if I brought to give to the game,

974
01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.840
I would prepare him.
I prepare them,
you know,
this is what's going to happen.

975
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:50.690
Okay.
You might see a fight,
you know,
hey,

976
01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:53.750
dad might even get in one.
No,
I never took it to that level.

977
01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:57.980
But you know what I mean?
I think,
uh,
I dunno,

978
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:02.660
again,
this is how guilty I am for my behavior that they,

979
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:07.190
I actually pulled up a quote from George Orwell who,
uh,

980
01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.900
granted this is from Wikipedia,

981
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.020
which the other day I looked up something that I knew something about and was

982
01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:15.890
completely inaccurate.
But this is according to Wikipedia,
George Orwell said,

983
01:02:15.891 --> 01:02:20.150
serious sport has nothing to do with fair play.
It's a bound up.

984
01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:22.790
It's bound up with hatred,
jealousy,

985
01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.750
boastfulness disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasures,

986
01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:30.200
pleasures and witnessing violence.
In other words,

987
01:02:30.201 --> 01:02:33.020
it's war minus the shooting.
Exactly.
Now,

988
01:02:33.021 --> 01:02:36.230
why the fuck would you bring a child to that?
And not only that,

989
01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.150
when was George Orwell alive
a long fucking time ago?

990
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:45.380
I don't know when he was alive.
When did he write?
1984 he didn't write it in 83.

991
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.140
I know that he wrote like the 30.
Stephanie.
I'm just saying.
See,

992
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.510
that's how he described sports back then.
So guys,
like,
you know,

993
01:02:53.511 --> 01:02:57.670
these Billy crystal guys always do those little heartwarming stories about,
uh,

994
01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.370
you know,

995
01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:01.820
their baseball cards and going down to the baseball stadium and acting like it

996
01:03:01.821 --> 01:03:06.290
was this fucking,
you know,
this time that was lost,
you know,

997
01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.140
George Orwell's right there according to Wikipedia,

998
01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:15.350
the guy proved my point.
I'm a moron,
but I did have a good time.

999
01:03:15.351 --> 01:03:16.430
I'm going to tell you,
write this right now.

1000
01:03:16.431 --> 01:03:18.980
If you ever get a chance in your life to smoke a Cuban cigar,

1001
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:22.880
definitely do it all right.
Because I'm not even a big smoker.

1002
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:27.910
And I could tell how fucking amazing that cigar was because I've drank fine

1003
01:03:27.951 --> 01:03:31.100
wines and I can't tell the difference,
you know?

1004
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.490
And it took me a long time to be comfortable with myself.
You know,

1005
01:03:34.491 --> 01:03:37.910
when he goes through the whole long process of spinning the big red wine glass

1006
01:03:37.911 --> 01:03:42.530
around,
I see red up on wine to try to learn.
So I,

1007
01:03:42.531 --> 01:03:43.370
you know about it.

1008
01:03:43.371 --> 01:03:46.820
So I wouldn't feel so fucking stupid when they bring a nice bottle of wine over

1009
01:03:46.821 --> 01:03:50.240
and I'm like,
you know,
this tastes like the shit I used to drink in high school.

1010
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:53.120
You know,
I learned that,
you know,
red wine.

1011
01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:56.450
The reason why it's in a bigger glass is because I'm about the oxygen and you

1012
01:03:56.451 --> 01:03:58.700
want it to breathe more and how to,
you know,

1013
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.390
move it around the fucking table and then you shove your fucking nose all the

1014
01:04:02.391 --> 01:04:05.960
way in it and yet put it in your,
switch it all around your mouth.

1015
01:04:05.961 --> 01:04:09.170
I got all the moves down and I'm like swallowed up Mike.
Yes.

1016
01:04:09.171 --> 01:04:13.880
This tastes like every other fucking red wine I've ever had.
That's not true.

1017
01:04:13.881 --> 01:04:15.590
I can tell a difference between like,
you know,

1018
01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:17.360
a Cabernet or my low or something like that.

1019
01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:22.361
But like I can't tell like the difference between a 1499 bottle and a,

1020
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:29.870
a $60 bottle and uh,
you know,
I guess I'm trying to say with this podcast,

1021
01:04:29.871 --> 01:04:33.440
I'm not that culture.
Okay.
All right.
Well,

1022
01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.330
so why don't you guys shine in what that,
okay.
Like,
well,
do you think David,

1023
01:04:38.331 --> 01:04:41.630
they should have a kids section two.
They just have a Chucky cheese section.

1024
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.191
It's not my fault.

1025
01:04:43.191 --> 01:04:45.800
You're knocked her up and you can't go to a game and have a good time now.

1026
01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.300
You know you want to be getting drunk with me.
See what I just did there.

1027
01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.470
That's how I made myself write made this guy who can't even defend himself

1028
01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:58.130
actually be secretly agreeing with me.
That's how I do it.

1029
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:00.203
But I mentioned I have a

1030
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:07.820
<v 5>so</v>

1031
01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:26.060
[inaudible],

1032
01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:46.971
<v 2>hey,
what's going on?</v>

1033
01:05:46.971 --> 01:05:49.760
It's bill burr and this is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

1034
01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:52.160
January 4th,

1035
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.270
2010 and I'm having a lot of difficulty doing this fucking podcast right now

1036
01:05:56.271 --> 01:05:59.870
because I feel like this is like,
you know,

1037
01:05:59.871 --> 01:06:01.310
it's my second attempt to start it.

1038
01:06:01.311 --> 01:06:05.810
I can already feel like this one's going to fucking suck because I feel like I

1039
01:06:05.811 --> 01:06:10.520
can't fucking do what it is that I do cause my downstairs neighbors a fucking

1040
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.970
cunt.
You know,
I told you guys that story,

1041
01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.680
but my downstairs fucking neighbor,

1042
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:19.190
how he waits till I'm on the road and he starts yelling at my girlfriend about

1043
01:06:19.191 --> 01:06:21.380
how loud she is,
you know?
And then when I come back,

1044
01:06:21.381 --> 01:06:24.610
all of a sudden he doesn't yell.
He's like real sarcastic.
He used to do it,

1045
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:29.270
you know,
if I drop something he'll be like,
do it again.
Right.
This old guy.

1046
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:32.180
So you know,
I'm a deck so I fucking,
whatever I dropped,

1047
01:06:32.181 --> 01:06:36.860
I dropped it from a foot higher,
you know,
like how was that yelled?

1048
01:06:36.861 --> 01:06:41.630
Fuck you know,
this isn't even,
this isn't even like my attitude towards the guy.

1049
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:46.520
Alright?
My girl,
you know,
she,
she,
she called me and she said,
look,

1050
01:06:46.521 --> 01:06:50.000
this guy's yelling at me.
I'm really getting tired of this shit.
You know,

1051
01:06:50.001 --> 01:06:52.700
I want you to go downstairs and say something to the guy.
Okay.

1052
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.640
And if you guys listen to my podcast,
you know,
I came to the resolution,
like,

1053
01:06:55.641 --> 01:06:57.050
what?
Where is that going to get me?

1054
01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:01.580
I'm not going to go downstairs and get into it with some old guy.
Okay.

1055
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.210
I don't fucking yell at old people.
All right.

1056
01:07:05.211 --> 01:07:08.630
I might whisper about them and call him consult on my fucking podcast.
Okay.

1057
01:07:08.631 --> 01:07:13.070
But I have a SPEC face to face.
Okay?
He's old.

1058
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.380
He doesn't have the Internet.
He's never going to hear this shit,
you know.

1059
01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:20.840
So anyways,
long story short is a yesterday and when the fuck was,

1060
01:07:20.841 --> 01:07:23.060
it was too,
it was January 2nd you know,

1061
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:26.480
I get a big thing January 2nd Christmas tree comes down.
That's it.

1062
01:07:26.481 --> 01:07:30.410
It's fucking over.
All right?
I wait until the end of new years.

1063
01:07:30.411 --> 01:07:35.260
I went to all that stuff.
Happy New Year.
I'll that Abby,

1064
01:07:35.261 --> 01:07:39.620
if I got ag,
go fuck yourself.
I go through all of that shit.

1065
01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:43.100
But the second that's over,
it's like,
all right,
it's,
you know,
it's game time.

1066
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:47.210
Alright,
back to reality.
It's no fat fuck coming down the goddamn chimney.

1067
01:07:47.211 --> 01:07:51.260
I didn't have a fucking chimney.
I have a boarded up fireplace.
All right?

1068
01:07:51.261 --> 01:07:56.120
So Christmas is on me.
If I don't go to best buy,

1069
01:07:56.121 --> 01:08:01.070
it ain't happening.
You know?
So you know,
that's one of those fucking things.

1070
01:08:01.071 --> 01:08:03.320
If you've got kids,
if you've got kids right now,
don't have,

1071
01:08:03.321 --> 01:08:05.720
don't have him listen to this part.
That's one of those fucking things.

1072
01:08:05.721 --> 01:08:08.280
If you're a parent,
right?
And you know,

1073
01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.390
and you're renting a place like mine that has a fucking boarded up fireplace,

1074
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.950
that's when you know the questions come,
you know,

1075
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.310
and you get even further into the lie,
you know?

1076
01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.080
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1077
01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:24.250
<v 1>Santa Claus,
Jay do average gifts.
Yeah.
Everybody around the world.</v>

1078
01:08:24.251 --> 01:08:28.120
Yes he does.
Yes he does.
Hey Shay comes down at Chevy.

1079
01:08:28.121 --> 01:08:32.380
How's he going to do it?
Well actually in our place,

1080
01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:33.830
um,

1081
01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.220
there is a chimney he comes down at and he has a secret key.

1082
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:42.430
A has a secret key and he's able to unload and you're just sitting there and you

1083
01:08:42.431 --> 01:08:45.020
had go on Jesus.
How deep?
You know what?
There is no

1084
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.660
<v 2>fucking Santa Claus.
Okay.
Jesus Christ.</v>

1085
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.130
How fucking dumb is the person that I made it with that you actually still

1086
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:55.280
believe this shit cause I know that that's not my half of the brain asking that

1087
01:08:55.281 --> 01:08:59.990
fucking question.
Alright kid,
do the fucking math.
You know,

1088
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.450
fat fuck has time to deliver all these gifts to everyone around the world.

1089
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:08.150
And even though you can't even grasp the reality of that,

1090
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:13.100
we have boarded up fucking fireplace.
Alright,

1091
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.960
come on.
Let's he get him back his fat ass to the fucking thing.

1092
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.850
So anyways,
so it's January 2nd.
Okay.

1093
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:27.200
Fucking trees coming down and uh,
I don't do it most Douche bags too.

1094
01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.170
Okay.
I don't fucking just,
you know,

1095
01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:33.710
drive down the highway and toss it off on the fucking medium strip,

1096
01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:37.760
like some sort of mob snitch.
All right.
I don't,

1097
01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:42.440
I give two in the back of the fucking anyone to actually do.
I take it outside.

1098
01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:46.910
All right.
I fucking whack my Christmas tree.

1099
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.530
Like fucking a Vigoda.

1100
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:53.300
Remember that in and the Godfather and he looks at Robert Duvall,
you know,
hey,

1101
01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.190
fulltime sake,
sorry.
Sorry.
Fish can't do it.
That's,
that's how I take,

1102
01:09:58.191 --> 01:10:03.191
I take my tree out to the fucking driveway and then I cut it up like a fucking

1103
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:05.840
body.
I do,

1104
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:09.040
I fucking saw off all the limbs and then I,

1105
01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:12.200
I cut up the trunk and like four or five different sections.

1106
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:16.370
And I stick it into the green trash bin like I'm supposed to.

1107
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:17.571
All right?

1108
01:10:17.571 --> 01:10:21.740
Then I sweep up the pine needles out of the driveway and all the fucking ones

1109
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:25.310
out of my living room.
And that's the end.
There you go.
Another Christmas,

1110
01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:29.250
go fuck yourself.
Right?
So this is a deal.
You know,

1111
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.810
when you first get to Christmas tree,
you're watering it.
Oh,
Christmas tree.
Oh,

1112
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:35.720
Christmas tree.
And three days into it,
you're so fucking stressed out,

1113
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:38.810
you stop watering it.
You start telling yourself what's fucking dead anyways.

1114
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:42.440
You know it's on its last legs,
whatever,
right?

1115
01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:46.100
So basically by the time you drag the fucking thing out that the tree is so God

1116
01:10:46.101 --> 01:10:49.280
damn dead,
all right,
it's,
it's,
you know,

1117
01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:55.620
pine needles fall out,
the little needles,
they fall out everywhere.
All right?

1118
01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.270
And I know they're not pine needles for all you fucking nature freaks out there.

1119
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.270
Whatever the fuck they are,
the goddamn evergreen needles,

1120
01:11:02.271 --> 01:11:05.480
they start falling all over the place.
So I bring it out my front door,

1121
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.800
stand in awe,
and I start dragging it down the fucking stairs.
Okay?

1122
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:13.130
And I'm trying not to be loud,
okay.

1123
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.650
But I am taking a tree down a flight of fucking stairs.

1124
01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:22.470
All right.
Fucking water spilling.
The needles are going all over the place,

1125
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:26.340
you know,
but I'm being quiet and it's 10 in the fucking morning.
Okay.

1126
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.280
If I wanted to build a house that could actually legally start at seven in the

1127
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:30.810
morning,
it's 10 in the fucking morning,
right?

1128
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.090
So I dragged the thing around and I'll bring it around the back and all of a

1129
01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:41.091
sudden fucking a grumpy old man sticks his head out the door and he looks at me

1130
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:43.890
and he just screams.

1131
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.310
But this bizarre look on his face.

1132
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:52.430
He just said something like the fuck did he say he just yelled out,

1133
01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:56.760
beautiful morning,
isn't it?
You know?

1134
01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.650
And I was looking at him like,

1135
01:11:58.651 --> 01:12:03.060
why the fuck did he just say something so nice with that angry look on his face?

1136
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:07.260
And for half a second I was going mad,
man,
I think that guy's crazy.
You know,

1137
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:11.160
you might be that guy in clockwork orange food.
All right.

1138
01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.820
You know?
So I was like,

1139
01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.610
I just sort of looked at him and I kept going.

1140
01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.010
I always forget that he's fucking sarcastic as hell.

1141
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:24.450
And whenever he says he means the exact fucking opposite,
he's basically saying,

1142
01:12:24.451 --> 01:12:27.390
yeah,
what a beautiful fucking morning if you'd make an all this God damn noise.

1143
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:32.760
So I walked back around again.
This time I look at him,

1144
01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:35.100
cause now at this point I finally figured out he was fucking with me.
So I'm,

1145
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.080
you know,
I'm staring down an old man,
right?
This,

1146
01:12:37.081 --> 01:12:40.770
this is really embarrassing story.
So I walk up,

1147
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.400
I walk upstairs,
right?
I stared at him,
he stares at me.

1148
01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:46.620
He doesn't say a fucking word cause that's it.
That's as emo.

1149
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.090
He doesn't like confrontations.
He says shit.

1150
01:12:49.091 --> 01:12:50.970
He doesn't mean he means the exact opposite.

1151
01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:55.590
And he yells at people through floors.
All right?
And He fucking lives alone.

1152
01:12:55.591 --> 01:12:59.670
If it's really sad situation.
Okay.
So what happens?
So I go upstairs.
All right.

1153
01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:03.590
My girls all heated.
He just fucking yelled at me again.
Right.
Are at our hour.

1154
01:13:03.591 --> 01:13:06.060
I want you to go down that time.
My God,
right.

1155
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.600
I'll fucking do it against my good judgment.

1156
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:12.360
Do not go down there against my gut saying,

1157
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.340
what the fuck good is gonna come out of this?

1158
01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:20.590
So I go down there and I walked down and he's fucking sitting there right now.

1159
01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:21.810
He's got this brick path.

1160
01:13:21.811 --> 01:13:24.750
You got to walk up and he's sitting at the end of it just staring at me,
right?

1161
01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:28.140
Expected me to walk by his path.
But Lo and behold,

1162
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.700
I make a left and I start walking up his path like some sort of fucked up,

1163
01:13:32.701 --> 01:13:36.900
high noon Shit.
And I'm staring right at the guy.
Okay.

1164
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.580
And you know what I saw on his face?

1165
01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:44.090
I saw fear and I see did what all guys do while you fucking cunt.

1166
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:48.480
Jesus Christ,
Carson Palmer,

1167
01:13:48.481 --> 01:13:51.810
just through a fuck another interception.
The checks are up 24 nothing.

1168
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:55.050
Oh my God,
it's fucking over.

1169
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.400
Have you ever seen a fucking team back into the playoffs?

1170
01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:01.800
More than the fucking jets did?
Jesus Christ.
I'll tell you right now,

1171
01:14:01.801 --> 01:14:06.330
I fucking hate the cults as a Patriots Fan,
but I'll tell you right now,
you know,

1172
01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.240
maybe just sidestep this fucking story.
Let me just tell you something right now.

1173
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:12.500
I feel bad for everybody in Indianapolis that should not happen to sports fans.

1174
01:14:12.501 --> 01:14:14.030
When you're going for something like that,

1175
01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.210
you should lose it because you got beat by a better team.

1176
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.600
You don't put in fucking some guy from home depot to be quarterback Jesus

1177
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.930
Christ.

1178
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:27.080
This is killing my prediction that Rex Ryan was going to make an attempt on his

1179
01:14:27.081 --> 01:14:31.790
fucking life.
I think the NFL knows it.
So they pulled Peyton manning out.

1180
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.350
I bet everybody in Indianapolis Douche bag in the week is you fucking GM or

1181
01:14:36.351 --> 01:14:38.000
whatever the hell made that God damn call.

1182
01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:44.230
So now this week they're playing the fucking Goddamn Bengals who had their best

1183
01:14:44.751 --> 01:14:48.020
receiver fall off the back of a fucking truck.
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

1184
01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.710
I hope we don't play them.
I want to do fuck what's going to happen to our team.

1185
01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:59.190
I think the jet's got some sort of Mojo going.
If they're on your schedule,

1186
01:14:59.191 --> 01:15:00.770
something fucking horrific is going to happen.

1187
01:15:00.771 --> 01:15:04.820
You're going to make a bad decision or somebody's going to die.
So anyways,

1188
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:08.960
so I'm walking up to this fucking old guy,
right?

1189
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:11.270
And,
uh,

1190
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:17.150
and I see fear on his face and he does what all guys do when they get scared is

1191
01:15:17.151 --> 01:15:21.140
they turn the fear into anger so they can function during this thing.

1192
01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:24.170
And my whole thing is,
I'm coming down here,
going,
build,
don't lose your cool.

1193
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:26.870
Let's try to fucking work this shit out with this guy.

1194
01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.180
Shall I just say,
uh,
Hey,
uh,
you know,
I came out the fuck I said,

1195
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:35.220
I just said,
you know,
I,
you know,

1196
01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:37.530
you're kind of always yelling up at my girlfriend.

1197
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:40.350
We always hear you yelling up at us.
I was just,
you know,

1198
01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:45.160
wondering what the problem was.
He's like,
what are your main problem?

1199
01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:50.100
Is faces all fucking twisted up.
And I'm like going,
oh Jesus,
here we go.

1200
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:53.730
And I'm like,
no,
you know,
I just,
I know that you think that we're loud.

1201
01:15:53.731 --> 01:15:56.380
We try to walk around,
not put our shoes on,
you know,

1202
01:15:56.381 --> 01:15:59.940
I just want to come down here and you know,
I just want to work it out.

1203
01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:04.140
And he goes,
what do you mean work it out?
I don't like,
you know,

1204
01:16:04.141 --> 01:16:06.510
try to come to some sort of resolution or whatever.

1205
01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:09.640
And he just starts fucking going.
She just shout or latch.

1206
01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:12.720
You just dropped a brick on a damn floor.

1207
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:15.530
He's screaming now he's screaming out.

1208
01:16:15.531 --> 01:16:18.540
He's fucking voice is echoing through the courtyard.
Okay.

1209
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.680
And I'm fucking sitting there trying to be civil,
but I don't give a fuck.

1210
01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:26.490
He just bang on the fucking floor.
I'm doing an impression of you.

1211
01:16:26.491 --> 01:16:29.790
You fucking asshole.
So he bangs on the fucking,

1212
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:33.160
I think it just banged on the fucking floor.
Do this fucking,

1213
01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:36.210
I'm 41 year old fucking man.
I'm still dealing with somebody downstairs.

1214
01:16:36.211 --> 01:16:40.950
This is ridiculous.
I've got to get a fucking house.
Um,
anyways,

1215
01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.480
so he starts fucking yelling.
I don't give a fuck.

1216
01:16:45.481 --> 01:16:48.480
Even if you were in that loose man,
I'm whisper on my own fucking podcast.

1217
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.760
Fucking contract guys been here 50 years.

1218
01:16:50.761 --> 01:16:54.480
He's probably paying $7 a month in rent.
Um,
so anyways,

1219
01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.160
<v 0>okay.</v>

1220
01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.800
<v 2>Yeah,
I don't give a shit.
The second an old person is yelling at you,</v>

1221
01:16:58.801 --> 01:17:01.800
even if you're being relaxed and when people immediately think that you're an

1222
01:17:01.801 --> 01:17:05.010
asshole,
you know,
it's Kinda like when it checks,
what was it drinking your face?

1223
01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:09.240
It's awfully,
well,
yeah,
obviously you did something.
She has a vagina,
right?

1224
01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:10.500
Obviously I did something,

1225
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:15.170
his fucking whole body body looks like a fucking wrinkled up,
nuts sack,
you know?

1226
01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:19.890
So this guy has fucking yelling at me and I'm going,
dude,
I'm,
I'm like,

1227
01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:20.611
I didn't say,
dude,

1228
01:17:20.611 --> 01:17:23.250
I was trying to be a restaurant list side trying to work things out.
He goes,

1229
01:17:23.251 --> 01:17:26.450
what do you mean that work it out?
He's like,
what?

1230
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:30.630
what does that some sort of new hip expression?
I what he said,
it's like,

1231
01:17:30.631 --> 01:17:34.200
oh my God,
did he just say some new hip expression?

1232
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:39.390
And he's going,
you know,
you're always walking across with his shoes.

1233
01:17:39.391 --> 01:17:42.600
And I'm like,
dude,
you think I can't hear your TV?
It's an old building.

1234
01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:47.910
What do you want me to do?
And he goes,
AH,
why don't you get lost,
right?

1235
01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:55.320
Like I'm in some little rascals episode,
like fucking three stooges.

1236
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:59.780
Why don't you a Scram,
right.
So I just kept going.
No,

1237
01:17:59.781 --> 01:18:03.360
I didn't come down here to argue with you.
I'm,
I'm trying.
He goes,

1238
01:18:03.361 --> 01:18:08.070
I already called the landlord about Ya.
And I was like,
well call him again.

1239
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:09.871
Call him again.

1240
01:18:09.871 --> 01:18:14.610
You think they're afraid of you moving out with your fucking $3 a month rent

1241
01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.680
fucking asshole.

1242
01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.020
They had ever called me cause they don't give a shit cause you're out of your

1243
01:18:19.021 --> 01:18:19.854
fucking mind.

1244
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:24.990
So at one point I'm trying to make a point to the guy and he just goes,

1245
01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.850
how's your band?

1246
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.800
Like making fun of the fact that I play guitar and I suck.

1247
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:36.950
He said it unbelievably sarcastic and really hurt my feelings for half a second.

1248
01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:41.250
He,
he's so caught me on a nowhere with that that I wanted to,

1249
01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:43.500
I almost started reading my resume.

1250
01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.040
I almost said actually I'm not an event.

1251
01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.950
Actually I'm a comedian and I'm playing the Improv next week.

1252
01:18:49.951 --> 01:18:50.761
Thank you very much.

1253
01:18:50.761 --> 01:18:55.230
Like that's how bad this guy caught me and pardon me after he said,
you know,

1254
01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.980
how's the bad?
How's your band?
I wanted to be like,
dude,

1255
01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:03.390
how's she a fucking life?
You know?
But I didn't.

1256
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:06.060
I didn't because I don't yell at old people.

1257
01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.290
It probably sounds like I do.
By the way,
I'm saying this,

1258
01:19:10.291 --> 01:19:12.630
this is the shit afterwards,
when I'm fencing about it,

1259
01:19:12.631 --> 01:19:15.380
they can't really fuck me up.
So finally I was just like,
you know what?

1260
01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:20.010
You're being a jerk.
You're being a jerk.
Oh,
is that right?

1261
01:19:20.011 --> 01:19:22.490
And as you have,
right,
he's actually,
I'm showing a new hip term,

1262
01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.910
fucking sitting there shaking like a leaf.
So fine.
I just,

1263
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:30.970
I walked away and little did I know that my girlfriend was standing on a balcony

1264
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.870
above all of it,
listening to all of it.
So not only did she

1265
01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.000
instigate the whole fucking thing telling me to go down there,

1266
01:19:40.001 --> 01:19:43.150
she actually got to listen to sky trash,
my guitar playing,
which by the way,

1267
01:19:43.151 --> 01:19:47.980
we both laughed our asses off about.
But before we did,

1268
01:19:47.981 --> 01:19:49.180
I went upstairs.
Okay.

1269
01:19:49.181 --> 01:19:53.590
And at this point I'm just sitting there like mad at myself.
Go,

1270
01:19:53.591 --> 01:19:54.910
why didn't you listen to yourself,
bill?

1271
01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.890
You knew that that wasn't going to go anywhere.
Right?

1272
01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:02.810
So any fucking way I go upstairs and I see my goal,

1273
01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:05.980
I don't care what you say is right.
They go,
is that what the fuck you wanted?

1274
01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.070
Is that what the fuck wanted?
I told you if that wasn't going to go anywhere,

1275
01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.140
that wasn't going to go anywhere.

1276
01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.010
And now what he's going to do is he's going to call all the fucking landlord and

1277
01:20:15.011 --> 01:20:18.520
he's going to bitch to high fucking heaven and he's going to exaggerate

1278
01:20:18.521 --> 01:20:20.140
everything that fucking went on down there.

1279
01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:21.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1280
01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.990
<v 2>Unfucking believable.
Unfucking believable.
And the thing was,</v>

1281
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.650
I felt really bad the second I got down there.
I just kept trying to go,
no,
no,

1282
01:20:28.651 --> 01:20:30.630
I'm trying to work this out and everything.

1283
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:33.030
I would say he would just repeat it and be like,
what is that?

1284
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:40.590
You know?
And I trashed my guitar playing and,
and I,
I,

1285
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:45.830
oh my God,
I was like,
Jesus Christ.
I was like embarrassed.

1286
01:20:45.831 --> 01:20:48.710
I was actually embarrassed.
I was like,
wow,
he can fucking hear me.
I know I suck.

1287
01:20:48.711 --> 01:20:50.990
I thought I played a quiet enough.
So now my pee was my aunt.

1288
01:20:50.991 --> 01:20:54.680
I got headphones on the next day.
And I'm playing my awful ACDC.

1289
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:59.390
It's a fucking hobby,
you know,
that'd be able to get a hobby old fuck.

1290
01:20:59.391 --> 01:21:02.150
Like getting some French.
See,
see that's why I,

1291
01:21:02.151 --> 01:21:04.710
that's why I kept my cool cause I would've said Shit like that,
you know,

1292
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:07.490
that's fucking bro them.

1293
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:10.910
And you know what's funny is my girl still fucking pissed at the guy.

1294
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:12.770
It's like a female thing I think.

1295
01:21:12.771 --> 01:21:17.360
Cause he's a guy and she kind of feels like he's bullying her and stuff and I

1296
01:21:17.361 --> 01:21:19.760
just kept telling him going,
you know what?
I feel bad for the guy.

1297
01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.000
I just slammed the door downstairs.
Am I being fucking loud?
It's just ridiculous.

1298
01:21:25.001 --> 01:21:29.830
I'm like borderline whispered here.
So maybe you can hear the fucking story

1299
01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.790
as his passive aggressive way of saying he disagrees with my last point.
Yeah.

1300
01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:35.621
Slam something else.

1301
01:21:35.621 --> 01:21:40.621
You can't do they have that word back in the 20s of what does that mean?

1302
01:21:40.641 --> 01:21:43.620
It's actually I'm new hip word for vagina.
Um

1303
01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.190
Yeah so I was just saying I,
you know,
I feel bad for the guy.

1304
01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.490
I have to whisper this part cause he might hear cause to tech guy isn't the

1305
01:21:51.491 --> 01:21:53.960
exact fucking nightmare.
Okay.

1306
01:21:53.961 --> 01:21:57.700
There's two ways you don't want to die in prison and you don't want to be that

1307
01:21:57.701 --> 01:22:02.330
old person alone.
You don't,
okay.
You don't,
you know,

1308
01:22:02.331 --> 01:22:05.360
if your spouse dies,
that's a different fucking story because you live life,

1309
01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.550
you know,
but you know it's,

1310
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:10.320
you don't wanna be the person who never got fucking married,

1311
01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.180
got even have a Goddamn parakeet.
Fucking always has the blinds,
you know?

1312
01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:16.310
I know I didn't want,
I didn't want to get in a fight with this fucking guy.

1313
01:22:16.311 --> 01:22:17.360
I feel like an asshole.

1314
01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:18.510
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1315
01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:21.780
<v 2>I really feel like a fucking asshole.
So that's my situation right now and I,</v>

1316
01:22:21.781 --> 01:22:25.950
you know,
that's my situation.
Like the guy in the Jersey shore.

1317
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:29.610
Do you guys watch it this week?
I don't even know what week I'm on.

1318
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:33.330
I fucking watched the first half of that shit.
I gotta tell you Mike,

1319
01:22:33.331 --> 01:22:36.030
the situation is my new fucking hero.

1320
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:40.170
They actually finally showed the footage because when snuck he got punched in

1321
01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:42.720
the face.
I was wondering like where the fuck were all the guys,

1322
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:47.730
how come they didn't do anything and they showed the footage of Mike the

1323
01:22:47.731 --> 01:22:52.580
situation.
Mack the situation,
he didn't do it.

1324
01:22:52.581 --> 01:22:54.300
Not only did he not do anything,

1325
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:58.620
he continued to hit on the girl that he was with and that's why I thought it was

1326
01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:02.280
hilarious if he didn't do anything because he was scared that would have been

1327
01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:06.080
something else.
But like this girl gets blasted in the face by this guy.

1328
01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:11.320
She's on the floor sobbing and he just looked at it almost like the way a wild

1329
01:23:12.411 --> 01:23:15.920
animal looks at you across the fucking cage.

1330
01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.340
You know when it's just sort of looking at you,
you know,

1331
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:22.920
sees you're not a threat or whatever and he's just immediate looks at the girl.

1332
01:23:22.921 --> 01:23:24.980
He switched you.
Yeah,
you want to get somebody,
you know,

1333
01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.430
you want to get some knee,
I'll show you my age.
It's fucking hilarious.

1334
01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:31.560
And then watching all those other guys in the house going,

1335
01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:36.470
you know Mikey the situation and he shot a whole fucking day.
What did he do?

1336
01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:41.420
He did nothing.
He did nothing.
What do you mean he didn't,
he did know God,

1337
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:48.510
the situation.
She was shit new sage was in,
played a Tortellini.
Oh,

1338
01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:52.380
it's like the most offensive fucking show on TV.
But that was some,

1339
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:54.930
that was fucking hilarious.

1340
01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:59.250
He didn't do a fucking,
he could,
he could give a fuck.

1341
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:02.790
And they all sit there going,
yeah,
it's not a true friend.
You fucking right.

1342
01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:03.624
It isn't

1343
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.863
<v 0>whatever.</v>

1344
01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:09.980
<v 2>Mike,
the situation knows what he wants.</v>

1345
01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.100
He does want to get in the middle of that shit.

1346
01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:13.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1347
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:18.250
<v 2>I have fucking meatball standing up there screaming at that fucking ugly gym</v>

1348
01:24:18.611 --> 01:24:22.660
teacher.
Um,
anyways,
I didn't want to talk about,

1349
01:24:22.661 --> 01:24:27.570
now I'm all fucking self conscious because that fucking
guy downstairs,

1350
01:24:27.571 --> 01:24:30.480
I was wondering about his life.
Like how did he end up down there?
You know,

1351
01:24:30.481 --> 01:24:33.000
you ever see old people like that?
Like how does,
how did that happen?

1352
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:36.163
<v 0>You know,</v>

1353
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.960
<v 2>Jesus Christ is out here in la,</v>

1354
01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:43.790
probably fucking tested for Mchale's navy,
you know,

1355
01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:48.050
went to network,
staring across it.
Ernest Borgnine going this motherfucker.

1356
01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:52.750
I thought he did movies.
Um,
anyways,
um,

1357
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.360
I don't know where to go with this fucking podcast.

1358
01:24:55.361 --> 01:25:00.310
I'm really kind of lost right now because,
uh,
because of that,
that shit.

1359
01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.700
Um,
so I dunno,

1360
01:25:03.701 --> 01:25:06.580
I was going to nominate the guy downstairs Douche bag of the week.

1361
01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:09.040
I would have done that five minutes ago when I was still pissed at a night.

1362
01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:10.810
I just felt bad for the guy.
Feel bad for the guy.

1363
01:25:10.811 --> 01:25:12.810
I feel bad about the whole fucking situation.

1364
01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.340
Jesus Christ.
This guy was like trembling as he was yelling at me.

1365
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:20.520
He was so out of his mind.
I kept trying to calm him down going,

1366
01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:24.790
I'm trying to work this out.
Cat lost,
you know,

1367
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:27.760
the whole thing took like fucking it maybe two and a half minutes.

1368
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:28.783
<v 0>Hm.</v>

1369
01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:34.190
<v 2>Anyway,
so what,
I don't know where the fuck to go from this.
Oh,
by the way,</v>

1370
01:25:34.191 --> 01:25:36.530
if you guys seen that fucking scam on TV with that,

1371
01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:40.280
that they're trying to sell you that gold coin for 1995,

1372
01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:45.370
the $50 gold coin for 1995 and in the end they start talking about how an ounce

1373
01:25:46.671 --> 01:25:50.510
of gold is worth like is selling for 1200 bucks.

1374
01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:52.510
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1375
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:54.550
<v 2>I mean that's one of those things where</v>

1376
01:25:56.110 --> 01:26:00.130
I don't feel bad for re I like for people who buy shit like that.

1377
01:26:00.131 --> 01:26:00.964
You know what I mean?

1378
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:06.390
If you're too stupid to realize that somebody selling you a $50 coined for 20

1379
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:10.634
bucks,

1380
01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.360
that that person would be going broke $30 a coin if you're too dumb to do the

1381
01:26:17.901 --> 01:26:19.490
fucking math on that.

1382
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:23.630
And then also not to hear how they go.

1383
01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:27.260
14 karat gold and then they use this term.

1384
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.140
I figured I was gonna write the term down.
I forget what it is,

1385
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:34.820
but it basically means
they basically,

1386
01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.360
they picked up a rock at the beach and they sort of dusted it with 14 karat gold

1387
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:48.550
and it's so lightly dusted with this fucking gold that they can actually sell it

1388
01:26:48.621 --> 01:26:53.621
for 1995 and still probably become multimillionaires and one of the great lines

1389
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:56.840
in it is limit five per customer.

1390
01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:00.650
Also to put that in your head like,
Oh fuck,
oh wait a minute.

1391
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:03.320
People at these things going to be gone.
People are buying five of these.

1392
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.680
This is a great investment.
This is a great investment thing.
You know,

1393
01:27:06.681 --> 01:27:11.510
in case the economy goes south,
I'll have these $50,
1995,

1394
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:19.990
1995 gold coins that they sprayed with the same shit that they spray the cast of

1395
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:24.330
the Jersey shore with people that just did fucking morons.
Go ahead,

1396
01:27:24.331 --> 01:27:28.820
go buy five of them and hide them and you snuggies you've dumped fucks.
Oh,

1397
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:30.320
that's what I should buy the guy downstairs.

1398
01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:33.860
I'm going to buy him a fucking snuggie as a peace offering.

1399
01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.900
You know,
get them that in a packaging of fucking earplugs.
Ah,

1400
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.630
what does that mean back in my day and we just weren't deaf.
Um,
all right,

1401
01:27:44.631 --> 01:27:48.230
you guys want to watch a fucked up youtube video?
I got one for you.

1402
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:52.010
That's actually not even on Youtube.
It's on a new website.

1403
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:57.560
It's called a today's big thing.
T o d a y s,
big thing altogether.

1404
01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.850
All lowercase.

01:28:01.851 --> 01:28:03.560
Get a posted.
Okay.

1406
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.110
Act like you're on the phone and you're fucking doing something.

1407
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:10.610
It's a no for those of you driving around.
It's 22 minutes,

1408
01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:14.450
26 seconds into the podcast.
If you want to fast forward to write this down.

1409
01:28:14.451 --> 01:28:17.440
Look up,
may be in fucking user friendly.
Uh,
it's called,
uh,

1410
01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.700
www dot today's big thing.com.
Um,

1411
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.880
back slash 2009 back slash 12 backslash 30,

1412
01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.540
um,

1413
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:34.220
it's a fat guy jumping into a frozen lake.

1414
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:36.140
And,
uh,

1415
01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:40.430
he goes right through the fucking ice and there's a moment there where,

1416
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:41.660
I dunno,

1417
01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:45.260
I didn't really find it to be a funny video and I thought his friends who are

1418
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:50.250
unbelievably ignorant,
um,
with their incredible,
uh,

1419
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:54.170
lack of urgency with the situation,
the situation,

1420
01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:59.840
I don't know how quick hypothermia sets in,
but,
uh,
I dunno,

1421
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:03.750
judging by his does the fucking way to this guy and that the stress that's

1422
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:04.890
already putting on his heart,

1423
01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:08.250
the kid easily could have had a fucking heart attack and they were trying to

1424
01:29:08.251 --> 01:29:11.520
pull the mother fucker out and it's unreal.

1425
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:13.680
He ends up walking out of the lake like Godzilla.

1426
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:16.500
He's just going to break the fucking ice all the way back to the show.

1427
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:27.370
Oh fuck,
I'm sorry.
They're fucking image.

1428
01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:31.640
Just hit me.
Ah,
all right.
Anyways,
anyways,

1429
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:35.570
as podcast sucks,
I got to bring the energy.
I got to bring the energy.
All right.

1430
01:29:35.630 --> 01:29:40.250
Uh,
let's talk about me right now I'm on the wagon.
I am seriously on the wagon.

1431
01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.730
I went to the rose bowl again this year and this year,

1432
01:29:43.731 --> 01:29:45.320
rather than bringing a camera,

1433
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:50.350
I bought my flip phone and I was videotaping and I was just embarrassed by my

1434
01:29:52.701 --> 01:29:56.390
behavior and it's not funny.
It's just embarrassing and no,

1435
01:29:56.391 --> 01:30:01.391
I won't be uploading it and know it will never be extras and a,

1436
01:30:01.431 --> 01:30:03.190
if you will,
part of the tailgate next to me.

1437
01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.010
Remember when I said I was going to email you the,
uh,

1438
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:08.630
some of the footage that I took,

1439
01:30:08.631 --> 01:30:11.300
I'm not sending it to you because I'm in it and I am,

1440
01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.370
I'm just really embarrassingly drunk.

1441
01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:18.200
I sounded like animal and every foe you remember animal from the muppet show,

1442
01:30:18.201 --> 01:30:21.710
but I love,
that's what I sounded like the entire fucking time.

1443
01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:25.730
And,
uh,
you know,
is the worst thing too,

1444
01:30:25.731 --> 01:30:28.100
was the next day when I watched the footage,
not only being that drunk,

1445
01:30:28.101 --> 01:30:30.590
but when I was actually looking at the unbelievable,

1446
01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:35.210
a spectacle that is the rose bowl.

1447
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:40.400
And to realize that I've gone to a two years in a row and can barely remember

1448
01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.780
more than 30 seconds of it.

1449
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:45.050
I'm watching the jets game right now and I just realized that he was playing

1450
01:30:45.051 --> 01:30:49.640
quarterback for USC last year in the Rose Bowl.
I actually sort of saw him play,

1451
01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:54.590
but I was too busy yelling at the fat chick in front of me and listening to her

1452
01:30:54.591 --> 01:30:57.320
husband's telling me that he was going to throw me down to the field.

1453
01:31:00.910 --> 01:31:01.770
So,
uh,

1454
01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:06.160
this year I actually passed out for eight minutes of the second quarter just out

1455
01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:09.730
like a light,
like an old person in a fucking rocking chair,
two in the afternoon,

1456
01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.060
just out,
you know,
fucking,
you know,

1457
01:31:13.061 --> 01:31:17.620
$600 a day after all is said and done the fucking Cuban cigars and all the

1458
01:31:17.621 --> 01:31:20.650
bullshit and the parking.
Now I'm just fast asleep,

1459
01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.060
granddaddy of them all.
It's just a fucking mess.

1460
01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.590
Maybe the footage will be funny at some point because I got to admit every other

1461
01:31:29.591 --> 01:31:34.591
thing is me cutting to my buddy who's drunk or each time and every time he just,

1462
01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:41.280
he just looks at the camera and he sort of slurs granddaddy of them all.

1463
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:47.490
It was bad.
I was hammered and I was making he,

1464
01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:52.000
we brought like these fucking Ribeye steaks that she's fucking sweet things,

1465
01:31:52.001 --> 01:31:53.920
right?
So we forget a knife.

1466
01:31:53.921 --> 01:31:58.890
My buddy is buttering them up with his index finger and uh,

1467
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:02.470
I put enough charcoal on there to cook a fucking Bronto Burger.

1468
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.120
So the second the flames hit that butter.
Oh my God.

1469
01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:12.130
It was unreal.
It was like the outside was well done in the inside was still cold

1470
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.880
and everyone was just watching me going,
hey buddy,
don't flip the steak too much.

1471
01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:22.180
It's like,
I can't,
I can't not flip it.
It's fucking hot as hell.

1472
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:26.380
And it was bad and uh,
it was really bad.

1473
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.380
It was really bad and I'm fucking it,
you know,

1474
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:31.600
I'm just really embarrassed with myself.
I scared an old man.

1475
01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.480
I was drunk off my ass.

1476
01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:38.560
Like I've been to Rosewell twice and I really don't even feel like I've been to

1477
01:32:38.561 --> 01:32:39.394
it.

1478
01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:43.930
I mean I was in there but I don't remember any of it and I don't know what

1479
01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:45.760
happened.
I can't name one fucking player.

1480
01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:48.850
You know that Guy Blount who punch that dude on a Boise state?

1481
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.230
I don't know the name of one person on Ohio state.

1482
01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:56.740
I don't know the name of one person,
an Oregon.

1483
01:32:56.741 --> 01:32:59.560
All I know is Oregon hasn't won the rose bowl since 1913.

1484
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:04.561
I did learn that and evidently cheap trick was somewhere there playing and uh,

1485
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.420
this is how much I was drinking and how much I was enjoying it.

1486
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:11.680
W We got there at eight 30 in the morning for a one 30 kickoff and within two

1487
01:33:11.681 --> 01:33:12.820
seconds it was like Wah.

1488
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:16.240
It was almost one 30 or two o'clock kickoff after all the bullshit.

1489
01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:21.970
And uh,
I was actually annoyed.
I was like,

1490
01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:24.160
why couldn't have been like a four o'clock game?
I'm having a good time.

1491
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.261
And once again,

1492
01:33:26.261 --> 01:33:29.950
we had a couple of big bottles of crown royal and we had a whole case of beer

1493
01:33:29.951 --> 01:33:34.090
between the two of us.
And for the life of me,
I don't know where it all went.

1494
01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:38.290
It was,
it was just gone.
It was fucking gone.

1495
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:41.410
And at the end of the night I bought,
you know,
none of that you want to set.

1496
01:33:41.411 --> 01:33:45.700
How about overrated expensive sunglasses.
Okay.

1497
01:33:45.701 --> 01:33:50.020
I've gotten a couple as like gifts and I always lose them on planes.
Right?

1498
01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:53.890
So this time I finally go out and buy a pair.
All right.

1499
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:59.110
And I don't take them on the road with me.
And this time I actually brought him,

1500
01:33:59.170 --> 01:33:59.560
you know,

1501
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:03.280
made a little checklist this year for the Rose Bowl and I fucking brought him

1502
01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:07.270
the end of the game.
I got um,
you know,

1503
01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:11.920
tucked into my fucking tee shirt and my buddy comes up.
Uh,
when a game,

1504
01:34:11.921 --> 01:34:16.450
it gives me a big hug and I just hear
they didn't break.

1505
01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:20.540
They just could fit on a,
I dunno,

1506
01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.830
pick somebody with a huge fucking head.
They could fit on that person's head now.

1507
01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:25.300
So it was bad.

1508
01:34:25.301 --> 01:34:28.240
So I actually came home and I dumped out all the beer that I had in the fridge.

1509
01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:32.920
I had dumped out the rest of my head a little,
uh,
fucking,
you know,

1510
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:36.490
those little fucking flask things ahead of that Jim beam.
I dumped that out.

1511
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:42.160
I had a little bit more left quarter of a bottle of gentleman jack.

1512
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.480
I know people cringe and I dumped out.
And then I got this 15 year old scotch.

1513
01:34:46.481 --> 01:34:49.660
I kept that,
but I'm shutting it down,

1514
01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.070
shutting it down.
I'm not going to fucking Aa,
but I'm shutting it down.

1515
01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.650
And next year I'm not drinking at the Rose Bowl.
I'm just not.
Okay.

1516
01:34:58.710 --> 01:35:02.910
I'm getting up fucking respectable grill and I'm going to redeem myself.

1517
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:04.530
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:35:04.530 --> 01:35:07.680
<v 2>Uh,
yeah.
It's just for his fucking pathetic.</v>

1519
01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:12.900
My behavior was just completely,
and I just looked like such a douche bag.

1520
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:16.590
I don't know.
Gee,
Bill,
what a week.
Huh?
You got to,

1521
01:35:16.591 --> 01:35:19.070
did you do anything good this week?
Alright,
let's see.
What did I do that,

1522
01:35:19.071 --> 01:35:22.620
you know what I oh,
Jesus Christ.

1523
01:35:22.621 --> 01:35:27.030
Can you fucking tackle somebody is 27 nothing.
The jets.

1524
01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:30.150
You know what the jets are the jets like red sox fans where they don't

1525
01:35:30.151 --> 01:35:33.420
understand.
I cannot red sox fans don't seem to understand that.

1526
01:35:33.421 --> 01:35:37.500
Singing sweet Caroline is one of the gayest things ever.
I got to admit,

1527
01:35:37.501 --> 01:35:40.440
you know something.
I respect jets fan because you're a hardcore fan.

1528
01:35:40.441 --> 01:35:44.910
If you follow that fucking team because they kick you in the seeds every year,

1529
01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:46.920
right before they twist your heart out of your chest.

1530
01:35:46.921 --> 01:35:48.300
So I totally fucking respect.

1531
01:35:48.301 --> 01:35:50.550
Even though I can't stand you because you were in a fucking division.

1532
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:54.570
But I'm telling you do when they put that fireman,

1533
01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.250
when that guy lifts the other guy up on his shoulders and he's dressed like he's

1534
01:35:59.251 --> 01:36:00.270
in the fucking village,

1535
01:36:00.271 --> 01:36:04.740
people with that stupid fireman hat and don't even fucking email me and tell me

1536
01:36:04.830 --> 01:36:08.940
who you are.
Actually a real fireman.
I don't give a fuck.
All right.

1537
01:36:10.290 --> 01:36:13.860
If you're wearing a fireman helmet and you're not on your way to a fire or

1538
01:36:13.861 --> 01:36:16.230
sitting in a fucking firehouse,

1539
01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:17.240
<v 0>okay,</v>

1540
01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:20.810
<v 2>you look like an asshole.
All right?
And when he,</v>

1541
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:24.290
j e t s jets,
jets,
jets,
you know something.

1542
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:29.000
That's the only thing of this year that my downstairs neighbor would understand

1543
01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:31.010
because that is a fucking,
that's like,

1544
01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:36.011
it's like a fucking cheer from the 1920s e t is judge,

1545
01:36:36.621 --> 01:36:38.990
judge,
judge,
and they're all pumping their fist.

1546
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:44.840
Like those guys on the Jersey shore listening to house music.
It's really,

1547
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:49.700
really fucking bad.
And uh,
speaking of which,
why do you guys need a new stadium?

1548
01:36:49.701 --> 01:36:54.490
What's wrong with that?
That stadium is fine.
You know what it is?
It's a,

1549
01:36:54.510 --> 01:36:57.270
this is some sort of scam going on with those new stage because the amount of

1550
01:36:57.271 --> 01:36:58.860
fucking new stadiums that they built,

1551
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.970
I kind of understood the new Yankee stadium,
you know,

1552
01:37:02.971 --> 01:37:04.920
it's not like they didn't have the money to fucking

1553
01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:05.770
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1554
01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:07.900
<v 2>fix it up again.
I guess they already did it,</v>

1555
01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:12.340
but the Meadowlands is only like what,
30 35 years old

1556
01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:16.320
and they build another one right next to it.

1557
01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:18.600
It looks like the exact same fucking thing.
Oh,
let me guess what.

1558
01:37:18.601 --> 01:37:22.260
He can get Sushi at this one.
So now it's $200 more for a seat.

1559
01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:28.510
We got even bigger seats because everybody's even fatter now.
Um,

1560
01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:32.670
anyways,
all right.
Last week I did a segment called oh Jesus,

1561
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:34.950
where,
uh,
you know,

1562
01:37:35.190 --> 01:37:40.190
I stated my opinions on what I felt about organized religion and all that type

1563
01:37:41.011 --> 01:37:45.680
of stuff and I got a shitstorm of emails.

1564
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:49.320
But believe it or not,
most of them were very complimentary.

1565
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:55.140
I'm saying that's exactly how I agree.
I how I feel.
Um,

1566
01:37:55.530 --> 01:38:00.070
you know,
hell,
I cares.
Once somebody said,
dear bill,

1567
01:38:00.071 --> 01:38:04.410
southern mega church is a corporate monster that needs to die to trick of the

1568
01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:09.411
church is that they've been perfecting their scam since man started blaming

1569
01:38:09.991 --> 01:38:13.770
natural phenomenon on God's,
it's all based on fear.

1570
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:17.700
And the constant charge decided at some point point that they could make money

1571
01:38:17.701 --> 01:38:20.790
off of it.
I don't blame the sheep for believing the shepherd.

1572
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:24.870
Blame the wolf for dressing like a shepherd.
Uh,
you know what?

1573
01:38:24.871 --> 01:38:29.250
I agree with that.
I think that's a great point.
But you know,

1574
01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:32.100
I have to admit past a certain age,

1575
01:38:32.610 --> 01:38:35.850
you're a moron if you believe stuff like that.
You know what I mean?

1576
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:39.780
It's like if you're in your 20s you can still blame your parents for shit that

1577
01:38:39.781 --> 01:38:43.530
they did to you.
You know?
And maybe that's why you're a little dysfunctional,

1578
01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:47.070
but you kind of work that shit out and that becomes a point in your life where

1579
01:38:47.071 --> 01:38:49.140
you got to stop blaming your fucking parents.

1580
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:53.130
You got to take charge of your own life and when you fuck up,

1581
01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:57.880
you got to take it on yourself.
All right?
Jesus Christ,

1582
01:38:57.881 --> 01:39:00.630
the fucking jets are running a Goddamn wishbone offense.

1583
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:02.143
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1584
01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.330
<v 2>Do you know what the genius of that is?</v>

1585
01:39:04.331 --> 01:39:07.770
Like the reason why they never did it in the prose is because the quarterback

1586
01:39:07.771 --> 01:39:10.600
gets fucking stuck,
you know?

1587
01:39:10.630 --> 01:39:15.550
And he can't have Joe Montana getting stuck trying to gain fucking six yards on

1588
01:39:15.551 --> 01:39:19.190
the ground.
Right?
But now the geniuses is they,
they,

1589
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:22.120
they stay stick like a fucking wide receiver or running back in there.

1590
01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:23.560
Why didn't anyone who came,

1591
01:39:23.561 --> 01:39:26.290
does anybody into football enough where they know who came up with that shit?

1592
01:39:27.130 --> 01:39:31.030
I want,
speaking of,
uh,
of which I'm already going into football withdrawal.

1593
01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.760
I don't know if other NFL fans have this,

1594
01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.840
there's always that amazing excitement when the NFL playoffs are coming up.

1595
01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:42.160
But then there's also like that depression of like,
fuck,
it's almost over.

1596
01:39:42.850 --> 01:39:46.690
You know,
I hate that like the NFL season,
just cause you know,

1597
01:39:46.691 --> 01:39:51.490
one game of fucking weak,
how quick it goes.
Um,
and also secondly,

1598
01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:55.970
uh,
I think I'm going to try to get into,
into the,
uh,

1599
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.740
the English premiere league soccer.

1600
01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:01.040
I found out that I have a channel that actually shows that shit and baseball's

1601
01:40:01.041 --> 01:40:04.550
coming up and I'm not,
I just,
I'm just not into fucking watching.

1602
01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:09.230
They've red sox angels and Yankees battle it out yet it for the 90th year and a

1603
01:40:09.231 --> 01:40:11.450
fucking row.
Um,

1604
01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:15.350
so if anybody can it over in England and tell me when that leak starts,

1605
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:17.120
when the playoffs are,

1606
01:40:17.121 --> 01:40:21.780
does it overlap in the baseball because that would be fucking phenomenal.
Um,

1607
01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:26.540
all right.
So anyways,
let's,
let's,
let's get back to this,
uh,
this stuff.
So yeah.

1608
01:40:26.541 --> 01:40:29.360
So that's how I look at it.
Okay.
The same way,
you know,

1609
01:40:29.361 --> 01:40:33.430
at some point you have to stop.
Yeah.
You got to stop blaming your parents.

1610
01:40:33.431 --> 01:40:36.230
She got to stop being like,
dude,
chicks are psychos.
You gotta be like,
no,

1611
01:40:36.231 --> 01:40:38.450
I'm picking Psychos and you've got to take responsibility.

1612
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:40.460
I feel the same way about religion.
Do you know what I mean?

1613
01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.120
If you're a kid or whatever,
and you're young,
right through your 20s,
you believe,

1614
01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:46.460
but at some point you got to understand it's a fucking guests.

1615
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:51.710
And that is an unbelievably profitable fucking business,

1616
01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:54.020
<v 0>you</v>

1617
01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:56.900
<v 2>know?
I mean,
especially,
you know,</v>

1618
01:40:56.901 --> 01:41:00.890
that shit that they say a rich man has as much chance as getting into heaven as

1619
01:41:00.891 --> 01:41:04.970
a camel has walking through the eye of a needle and you look at how these

1620
01:41:04.971 --> 01:41:08.630
fucking people in your religion or live in a,

1621
01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:12.830
then they don't seem too concerned about getting through the eye of that fucking

1622
01:41:12.831 --> 01:41:14.450
needle.
You know,
wake the fuck up.

1623
01:41:14.451 --> 01:41:19.300
People go buy a $19 gold coin yet Jesus all right?

1624
01:41:19.301 --> 01:41:24.080
And not trying to be judged,
whatever.
Maybe,
maybe I don't understand it.
Um,

1625
01:41:24.081 --> 01:41:28.190
all right,
next one.
Um,
it was actually,
you know what?

1626
01:41:28.191 --> 01:41:31.160
There was somebody who actually had a real rational point here that I wanted to

1627
01:41:31.161 --> 01:41:33.920
read.
Uh,
alright.

1628
01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:38.180
And it's entitled for what it's worth,
you know,
at first of all,
right there.

1629
01:41:38.210 --> 01:41:41.120
That's what the Internet needs a little more of,
you know,

1630
01:41:41.121 --> 01:41:45.530
for what it's worth rather than being like,
hey shithead like I do.
Oh Great.

1631
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:47.840
Um,
all right bill,

1632
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:50.000
just want to say I understand your points on the religious thing.

1633
01:41:50.001 --> 01:41:52.490
Like us raised Catholic and left at this point.

1634
01:41:52.491 --> 01:41:57.170
I actually recently started going back to Christian Church that doesn't have a

1635
01:41:57.171 --> 01:42:00.530
denomination.
It's not bad or anything.
It's just playing Christian.
Anyway.

1636
01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.110
I totally agree with you when it comes down to the fact that people don't really

1637
01:42:03.111 --> 01:42:06.170
know and the whole idea is full of holes.

1638
01:42:06.650 --> 01:42:10.310
I think the biggest problem is that Christians love to get into debates only

1639
01:42:10.311 --> 01:42:12.410
bringing the faith concept along,

1640
01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:16.280
which obviously makes no sense to people that haven't bought into the whole
idea,

1641
01:42:16.281 --> 01:42:21.020
which makes the whole argument pointless.
Exactly.
Um,

1642
01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:24.890
and that's the problem with Christians,
just like other groups of people.

1643
01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.490
A lot of them are frankly stupid and don't know what they're talking about.

1644
01:42:28.491 --> 01:42:30.230
It's not really their fault.

1645
01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.250
Just not everyone is meant to teach others on every topic.

1646
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:38.420
All right?
You know,
I don't know if I agree with that.
No,
it is your fault.

1647
01:42:38.421 --> 01:42:41.000
If you're a fucking idiot,
why?
If you're born stupid,

1648
01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:42.710
you know that's not your fault.
But,
uh,

1649
01:42:43.670 --> 01:42:47.210
if you're just a fucking moron who repeats shit that people say in bars like me.

1650
01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.930
All right,
why don't we shut the fuck up and read the rest of this?
All right,

1651
01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:51.280
Bill,

1652
01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.010
I think something you could understand is no one buys into the Christian thing

1653
01:42:55.011 --> 01:42:59.240
just because of the Bible.
If they do,
they probably can be won over by anything.

1654
01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.360
People buy into the Christian thing because of something they felt that that is

1655
01:43:02.361 --> 01:43:04.400
beyond understanding.
After feeling it,

1656
01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:08.270
they start looking for an answer and they are drawn into the Christian thing.

1657
01:43:08.271 --> 01:43:11.720
At that point,
you can just feel it in your bones and you know it's real,

1658
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:15.080
but it's a personal experience for everyone and it can't be taught.

1659
01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:18.890
But I think what that guy meant by asked Jesus and tell you is not literally
ask.

1660
01:43:18.891 --> 01:43:20.990
I knew we didn't mean that I was just being an asshole.

1661
01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.550
It's really a soul search,

1662
01:43:22.551 --> 01:43:25.940
which isn't something that usually happens overnight and eventually you will

1663
01:43:25.941 --> 01:43:28.760
come to an understanding within yourself.
Uh,

1664
01:43:28.761 --> 01:43:30.770
reading the Bible going to church can help,

1665
01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:34.880
but it all comes down to whether you are even interested to finding out,

1666
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:38.420
I mean right there,
I 100% agree with all of that.

1667
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:43.670
Okay.
And I like to think that I made some sort of point where I,

1668
01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:50.950
I guess I believe in some sort of higher thing because you can feel,

1669
01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:56.460
I know it's inexplicably,
but I also know that nobody alive knows what the like,

1670
01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:59.610
I feel that that,
that feeling that you're talking about,

1671
01:43:59.611 --> 01:44:04.611
I feel as a private thing and it shouldn't be exploited and it shouldn't be this

1672
01:44:05.521 --> 01:44:10.260
moneymaking thing and you shouldn't try to scare the shit out of me that I'm

1673
01:44:10.261 --> 01:44:14.040
going to hell and all this stuff and start making up all these fucking cartoon

1674
01:44:14.041 --> 01:44:18.960
characters like they have.
You know what I mean?
That's what they're doing.

1675
01:44:18.961 --> 01:44:22.020
They're just making up shit and they're making up stories and all this fucking

1676
01:44:22.021 --> 01:44:27.021
crap based off of this feeling and also based off of people's fear of dying.

1677
01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:30.240
But I,
I have to 100% agree with all that.
I mean,
see,

1678
01:44:30.241 --> 01:44:33.900
that's the way you go about it.
Okay?
For what it's worth.
Okay?

1679
01:44:34.050 --> 01:44:38.760
The mere fact that he puts in for what it's worth is right there.
It's like,
okay,

1680
01:44:38.761 --> 01:44:41.790
I'm not ramming this shit down your throat for what it's worth.

1681
01:44:41.791 --> 01:44:44.550
This is what I feel.
No point did he say he's 100% right.

1682
01:44:44.730 --> 01:44:48.660
This is just how we feel.
Okay?
That's the way to go about it.

1683
01:44:48.661 --> 01:44:53.550
As opposed to these other person who,
this is what somebody wrote me,
Bill,

1684
01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:58.760
there's an empty spot inside of you that you try to fill with anything you can

1685
01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:03.300
fame hitting it,
big fortune,
family,
dog,

1686
01:45:03.301 --> 01:45:04.134
et Cetera.

1687
01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:09.180
But actually there isn't anything that can fill that void and that empty void

1688
01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.070
fill that void,

1689
01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:15.180
empty feeling inside you except for a GE says,

1690
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:19.920
<v 3>Aye.</v>

1691
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:23.900
<v 2>I mean,
that is the funniest fucking thing ever.</v>

1692
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:28.700
They're trying to convince me that I'm not happy.

1693
01:45:28.730 --> 01:45:32.180
This is like the happiest period of my life.
I got a great girl.

1694
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:36.050
I'm living with her.
I love her.
I love living with there.
I got a fucking dog.

1695
01:45:36.051 --> 01:45:40.490
I mean,
how great my life is to come home to them.
It's great.

1696
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:44.420
It's fucking great.
My career is right where it's at.

1697
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:47.690
I've carved out a nice niche for myself.
People show up.

1698
01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:50.780
I got a cool level of notoriety,

1699
01:45:51.230 --> 01:45:54.500
but I could still walk down the street with no pants on and no one would give a

1700
01:45:54.501 --> 01:45:58.940
shit short of why is this guy not wearing pants and having a great fucking time

1701
01:45:59.150 --> 01:46:04.150
and this person is super imposing their own feeling of when they accepted Jesus

1702
01:46:05.691 --> 01:46:09.650
because they couldn't fill it up with shit that now they're going to tell me

1703
01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:14.900
that I'm empty and they don't even fucking know me moron.

1704
01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.960
So anyways,
the only way to fail it up,

1705
01:46:16.961 --> 01:46:20.540
he has to come to our church and do except Jesus and the reaching your pocket,

1706
01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:25.250
take out that legal tender,
put it in the basket,
gave them to me.

1707
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:30.180
I'll go gain a hooker and we'll be out again next Sunday.
Um,

1708
01:46:31.190 --> 01:46:34.220
he actually made that spot inside of you.
Okay?
Let's,
this is how,

1709
01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:37.160
this is how fucking you guys into science fiction.

1710
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.910
All you guys who can't afford movie tickets because of the recession and you're

1711
01:46:40.911 --> 01:46:45.020
really killing yourself because you can't go see Avatar.
I got one for you here.

1712
01:46:45.021 --> 01:46:49.580
Just sit back,
close your eyes,
take a hit off something if need to.

1713
01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:54.050
Here's the rest of this shit.
He actually made that spot inside of you.

1714
01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:59.690
Uh,
that only he fits into crepey.
Um,

1715
01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.580
really so he wants to get inside of me and that spot then only he fits into

1716
01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:10.460
Jesus Christ.
And all you have to do is ask,

1717
01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:10.791
you know,

1718
01:47:10.791 --> 01:47:15.470
I don't want to ask some dead fucking hippie to crawl into a space inside me.

1719
01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:19.520
They don't,
he only fits into,
he's knocking at the door of your heart.

1720
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:24.230
SORTA guy.
I'm not making this up.

1721
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:28.400
Is this lyrics to a bad Jim Nabors song written by John Denver,

1722
01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:32.700
Sergeant Carter.
Anyways,
uh,

1723
01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:36.320
you only have to open the door because he's a gentleman.

1724
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:41.990
He won't force his way in.
He will come in if invited.
He's waiting patiently.

1725
01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.010
But is it?
But,
but,
and this is from me to you.

1726
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:51.080
There's no time like the present.
Nobody knows how long anybody lives.

1727
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:56.890
It says in the Bible also tomorrow is promised to no one but don't get spooked.

1728
01:47:57.710 --> 01:48:00.830
Oh yeah.
Why would I want to get spooked when you telling me,
you know,

1729
01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:05.450
tomorrow isn't promised to anybody and this is dead fucking son of this dude who

1730
01:48:05.451 --> 01:48:10.400
was stuck at a vagina without any seaman who wants to get inside me into a space

1731
01:48:10.401 --> 01:48:11.510
that only he fits into

1732
01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:17.030
a but though get spoke to doesn't mean as soon as you do that it's curtains.
No,

1733
01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:18.950
I'm not saying,
Oh you,
this guy are the worst.

1734
01:48:18.951 --> 01:48:22.460
I can't even read the rest of that shit is just fucking ridiculous,
dude.

1735
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:23.720
You don't want,
you're doing right now.

1736
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:28.580
It's like you went down to the car dealership and they sold you a lemon and now

1737
01:48:28.581 --> 01:48:29.930
you want to dump it onto me.

1738
01:48:29.931 --> 01:48:34.730
And you're trying to remember the horrible sales pitch that they gave to you.

1739
01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:41.690
Come on in here.
Or are you tired?
Are you weak?
Are you,

1740
01:48:41.730 --> 01:48:46.280
are you broke?
How many people out there?
I could fucking do that.

1741
01:48:47.570 --> 01:48:50.000
Jesus Christ.
Here I am trying to blow up telling jokes.

1742
01:48:50.001 --> 01:48:51.980
Why don't I just start my own fucking church?

1743
01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:53.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1744
01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:54.613
<v 2>You know who else?</v>

1745
01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:58.400
Who else there has been tired this week and what you do is you have your hand up

1746
01:48:58.401 --> 01:49:02.950
the whole time.
Who not?
There's been tired.
Let me hear you say how tired.
What?

1747
01:49:02.951 --> 01:49:04.520
Jesus wants you to be tired.

1748
01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:10.190
He wants you to be tired of living the life you're living
staff.

1749
01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:13.600
You'd wake up against a man energy.

1750
01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:18.380
Reach into your fucking pockets of I want when I want to curse in my church.

1751
01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:21.810
Is she a fucking pockets?
Gimme some goddamn money you guys want to.

1752
01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:23.420
Who here wants to feel better?

1753
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:26.300
Would you guys go to a church if I just talk like this?

1754
01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.510
I used to do that stupid sing stuff.

1755
01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:32.000
Stopping my foot wearing a fucking sky blue.

1756
01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:35.000
Three three piece fucking suit.

1757
01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.580
Now would you go to my church if I did that?

1758
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.840
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1759
01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.280
<v 2>Yeah.
Whoever wants to feel better.
All right.
What do you want to do this year,</v>

1760
01:49:44.281 --> 01:49:47.440
sir?
You want to lose some weight but you're going to lose weight?
Yeah,

1761
01:49:47.441 --> 01:49:49.530
you can do it.
Stop being a pussy.

1762
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:52.800
He chicken breasts and fucking Broccoli at seven o'clock.
Go to bed.

1763
01:49:52.801 --> 01:49:56.070
Drinks of fucking water.
All right.
That'll be five bucks.

1764
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:02.210
Ass Off.
I don't even want to fuck.
I'm going with this already.

1765
01:50:02.211 --> 01:50:06.080
Getting self conscious and I'm gonna start screaming again.
Don't worry.

1766
01:50:06.081 --> 01:50:09.260
The podcast will be fine.
I just got to let this,
I got to look to shit.

1767
01:50:09.261 --> 01:50:11.830
Die Down with fucking uh,

1768
01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:13.700
<v 0>okay.</v>

1769
01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:17.250
<v 2>I don't know that guy.
I played Mr Hand and fast times at Ridgemont high.</v>

1770
01:50:17.251 --> 01:50:21.810
He's dead now,
isn't he?
All right.
Um,
all right,
let's plow ahead.

1771
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.540
<v 0>Okay</v>

1772
01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:26.520
<v 2>Dude.
Like he can't believe all this shit I got,
I got another guy who actually,</v>

1773
01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:27.413
um,

1774
01:50:27.930 --> 01:50:30.720
he was saying that he thought the podcast was hilarious and all this stuff they

1775
01:50:30.721 --> 01:50:32.310
sent in religion was really funny.

1776
01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:34.980
And then he tried to get me to read the book of Mormon

1777
01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.650
and I was real sneaky.
And he's,
you know,

1778
01:50:39.870 --> 01:50:43.230
his selling points where also I,
I don't want to read it.
I don't want to,

1779
01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:47.070
I've been to Utah.
I've seen what your religion does to people.
Okay.

1780
01:50:47.071 --> 01:50:49.050
I've been there,
I've seen it.

1781
01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.540
Everybody sneaking around fucking the girlfriend in the ass.

1782
01:50:51.541 --> 01:50:54.000
So she's still a Goddamn Virgin,
you know,

1783
01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.730
32 year old guys still walking around.

1784
01:50:56.731 --> 01:51:01.731
Never had a piece of ass in their fucking life because some guys got 58 wives

1785
01:51:02.041 --> 01:51:04.380
told them not to.
I mean,
I don't know what to tell you.

1786
01:51:04.650 --> 01:51:08.790
I'm not trying to shit on Utah.
All right.
Beautiful scenery.
Okay.

1787
01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.680
But you only get one life.

1788
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:12.633
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1789
01:51:13.770 --> 01:51:17.880
<v 2>Go down to the drug store,
get some condoms and start talking shit.
All right.</v>

1790
01:51:17.910 --> 01:51:21.750
That's what the fuck you supposed to be doing and your teens in your 20s okay.

1791
01:51:21.751 --> 01:51:25.500
And then eventually one day you're going to be fucking a girl that you don't

1792
01:51:25.501 --> 01:51:26.280
give a shit about.

1793
01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.540
You're going to roll over and you're going to feel this empty feeling.

1794
01:51:28.541 --> 01:51:32.880
And you'd be like,
what the fuck am I doing?
I can't do this anymore.
Oh my God.

1795
01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:36.900
She really going to try to have some false sense of intimacy.
Now.

1796
01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:37.890
Isn't that the worst?

1797
01:51:38.010 --> 01:51:40.230
That's why I always hated about one night stands was afterwards.

1798
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:43.830
I always loved those professional girls who just got the fuck out afterwards.

1799
01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:48.900
Not trying to,
you know,
suppress any sort of a guilt,
you know,
any sort of guilt.

1800
01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:54.450
That's the worst one night stand is when that fucking creepy hand comes over and

1801
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:57.300
you know,
she puts her head onto your chest

1802
01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:03.580
and their fucking hair and he's just sitting there.
I remember Billy Crystal and,

1803
01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:04.891
and uh,

1804
01:52:04.891 --> 01:52:07.830
when Harry met Sally and he's got that one foot on his floor and his eyes are

1805
01:52:07.831 --> 01:52:12.540
wide awake.
Yeah.
At some point you get sick of that and he's just like,
all right,

1806
01:52:13.230 --> 01:52:17.640
you know,
if I don't fucking settle down and get a good one,
you know,

1807
01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:23.130
I'm up like that fucking grumpy old man downstairs.
Uh,

1808
01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:27.840
all right.
Somebody's trash me on my ignorance on the NFL network,
you said,

1809
01:52:28.150 --> 01:52:30.160
I'm surprised it's such a big fortune.

1810
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:35.010
A sports fan is Jesus Christ.
Do you see emails?
I guess first of all,

1811
01:52:35.011 --> 01:52:40.011
let me say that I am surprised that such a big sports fan as you is confused by

1812
01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:44.460
the NFL network and Nfl Sunday ticket.

1813
01:52:44.850 --> 01:52:49.280
The Sunday ticket is the exclusive offering on directv that gives you every
game.

1814
01:52:49.281 --> 01:52:54.050
Every week I realized that I have this so I can watch the eagles in DC and by

1815
01:52:54.051 --> 01:52:57.950
the way,
it's amazing.
It's like sports having,
I can't imagine not having it.

1816
01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:03.010
I understand now the NFL is just a single channel that is also on direct TV and

1817
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:08.900
as a frequent toot,
I understand all of this.
Okay.
I have cable.

1818
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:13.280
It's not available for me out here.
Okay.
In order for me to get it,

1819
01:53:13.281 --> 01:53:16.580
I have to sign up with direct TV and they wanted me to sign like a three year

1820
01:53:16.581 --> 01:53:21.581
contract with a cable service that I've never seen before or used for.

1821
01:53:22.131 --> 01:53:26.110
All I know they suck.
Okay.
I was giving him shit.
I understand their business.

1822
01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.690
I have no problem paying for the NFL ticket.

1823
01:53:29.691 --> 01:53:31.520
I would buy it if it was on cable.
All right.

1824
01:53:31.521 --> 01:53:34.340
But I can't put addition to the side of my fucking building.
I can't,

1825
01:53:34.341 --> 01:53:38.990
my landlord does not allow it.
All right?
So,

1826
01:53:38.991 --> 01:53:42.350
and I understand that they have good matchups and they show them on Thursday as

1827
01:53:42.351 --> 01:53:46.910
a way to entice me into,
uh,
and to fucking,

1828
01:53:46.911 --> 01:53:51.470
you know,
buying the network.
I get it.
It's fucking business.
But Dude,

1829
01:53:52.130 --> 01:53:52.431
you know,

1830
01:53:52.431 --> 01:53:56.730
to blackout of game on Christmas is a corporate conti fucking mood and you,
you,

1831
01:53:56.750 --> 01:54:00.320
you're fucking with people's holidays,
you know,
show me the Goddamn game.

1832
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:04.160
Take one day off.
You know?
That's all I was fucking saying.
Okay.

1833
01:54:04.161 --> 01:54:05.540
I understand the whole concept

1834
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:10.940
because explaining the NFL network to me,
I don't understand that.
Oh,
really?

1835
01:54:10.941 --> 01:54:13.770
Did you enjoy watching your fucking eagles today?
Get pounded by the,
the,

1836
01:54:13.771 --> 01:54:18.590
the goddamn cowboys man.
What a what a rough week in Philly.

1837
01:54:18.591 --> 01:54:21.410
Huh?
What a rough month.
They lose cliff Lee.

1838
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:25.480
They get trashed by the God damn cowboys and,
uh,

1839
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:31.300
they lose the winter classic to my Bruins in overtime.
I got to met dude.

1840
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:34.640
Nobody takes over a stadium like Philly fans.
Did.
Anybody watched that?

1841
01:54:34.670 --> 01:54:37.100
It was the sound,
like it was a fucking home game for the flyers.

1842
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:42.740
Really disappointed with Bruins fans,
but you know what,
tickets was so much.

1843
01:54:42.741 --> 01:54:44.550
It was the fucking rich people there anyways,

1844
01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.210
and then we're going to do anything.
Um,

1845
01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:51.230
but still I got to give it up for the fucking Philly's fan.
Uh,
Philadelphia fans.

1846
01:54:51.231 --> 01:54:52.820
All right.
That might be the end of the podcast.

1847
01:54:52.821 --> 01:54:57.660
One of my 49 whispering minutes into this thing.
Um,

1848
01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:01.700
anyways,
I dunno,
this is my deal.

1849
01:55:01.701 --> 01:55:03.620
I think when it comes down to that whole God thing,

1850
01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:08.030
I think that's a personal fucking journey and I'm not working on it at all.

1851
01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:11.120
So what I'm really doing is just blown off church,

1852
01:55:11.150 --> 01:55:14.660
but I'm never going to go back to church anyways,
but I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
I have to,

1853
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:19.750
I have to start living by some sort of a fucking code
because,
uh,

1854
01:55:19.810 --> 01:55:21.290
because I'm not,
you know,

1855
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:24.050
and when you become an adult and you don't have parents anymore,
I mean,

1856
01:55:24.051 --> 01:55:25.310
as long as you're not breaking the law,

1857
01:55:25.311 --> 01:55:27.230
you can pretty much do a lot of scumbag things.

1858
01:55:27.230 --> 01:55:30.620
And then one really calls you on it.
And,
uh,
you know,

1859
01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:35.480
pass it out in the second quarter of a fucking Rose Ball.
What a loser.

1860
01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:40.310
What a fucking loser.
Um,
anyways,

1861
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.841
what else do I got here?

1862
01:55:41.841 --> 01:55:45.900
I just got sorta like fucking this is like holiday leftovers,
this podcast.
Uh,

1863
01:55:46.250 --> 01:55:50.990
last week I was talking about some girl who was too dumb to fuck and somebody

1864
01:55:50.991 --> 01:55:52.010
really latched onto that.

1865
01:55:52.011 --> 01:55:56.690
At that time my buddy was hanging out with that girl who thought the sun and the

1866
01:55:56.690 --> 01:55:58.160
moon were the same thing.
And I was saying like,

1867
01:55:58.161 --> 01:55:59.750
you have to get with a girl who is so stupid.

1868
01:55:59.751 --> 01:56:03.020
Like you can't have sex with her because it feels like a form of rape.

1869
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.580
<v 3>Ah,
fuck.</v>

1870
01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:13.970
<v 2>Anyways,
this guy said,
hey bill,
I love the podcast,</v>

1871
01:56:13.971 --> 01:56:17.510
but now it felt compelled to write you until you mentioned the story about the

1872
01:56:17.511 --> 01:56:21.680
chick who didn't know the mood and the sun with two different stories and too

1873
01:56:21.681 --> 01:56:22.381
dumb to fuck you.

1874
01:56:22.381 --> 01:56:25.070
The first guy I ever heard mentioned that I cannot agree with you more.

1875
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:29.150
I have a too dumb to fuck story.
Okay.
I think we have a new segment here.

1876
01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:31.040
Um,
here we go.

1877
01:56:31.041 --> 01:56:35.870
This is this guy's story about meeting a girl who was too dumb to fuck.
He said,

1878
01:56:35.871 --> 01:56:37.100
uh,
when I got out of college,

1879
01:56:37.610 --> 01:56:42.020
I was doing the traditional stint in the restaurant serving industry.
Uh,

1880
01:56:42.021 --> 01:56:46.570
there was this smoking hot 19 year old waitress working there that every do I

1881
01:56:46.590 --> 01:56:48.490
sound like creepy right now cause I'm kind wished for anything.

1882
01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:53.500
It was a slogan fucking 19 year old waitress and he's creeping up of working uh,

1883
01:56:55.761 --> 01:57:00.320
there that every dude and at least one other girl was trying to get a piece of

1884
01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:03.650
bill.
This girl wasn't legitimate 10.
Anyway,

1885
01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.170
we were at a party one night and I was spending all my time with,

1886
01:57:06.171 --> 01:57:08.690
they're listening to a talk about all sorts of nonsense,

1887
01:57:08.691 --> 01:57:12.530
trying to be the nice guy trying to get some play right.
You put in your time at,

1888
01:57:12.531 --> 01:57:16.370
so anyways,
he said,
well,
the booze was kicking in and uh,

1889
01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.060
things were starting to work out.
Uh,
we started kissing a bit.

1890
01:57:20.090 --> 01:57:22.040
Thanks for looking promising,
but uh,

1891
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:25.130
I knew it would be some time before I get anywhere worthwhile.

1892
01:57:25.190 --> 01:57:26.660
I don't know why you would think that,
dude,

1893
01:57:26.661 --> 01:57:29.600
you should have closed the fucking deal.
Um,

1894
01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:33.050
he said I was w that's classic to do.
You know what I would've done?

1895
01:57:33.051 --> 01:57:37.640
I would've fucked her right there.
Um,
I was willing to put in the time.
All right,

1896
01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.253
so anyways,

1897
01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:43.970
a little later in the night she started talking about a rabbit she had when she

1898
01:57:43.971 --> 01:57:47.930
was younger and she was subset that her rabbit never laid eggs.

1899
01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:50.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1900
01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.930
<v 2>Have you ever heard of something so stupid?</v>

1901
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:55.350
If ever heard something so stupid you can't believe you've heard it correctly?

1902
01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:58.200
I can not.
Oh man,
that must have been fucking hilarious.

1903
01:57:58.201 --> 01:58:01.380
Cause I'm sure there was music playing.
I'm sure you did.
Like,

1904
01:58:01.410 --> 01:58:02.610
like we're like what?

1905
01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:05.910
And it's sort of like put your ear all at one was inside of her mouth to make

1906
01:58:05.911 --> 01:58:08.700
sure you fucking heard of ray.
He goes,
I cannot believe my ears.

1907
01:58:08.701 --> 01:58:12.930
So I questioned her only to have her re repeat the claim with even more vigor.

1908
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:18.990
I had a rather,
it did even lay eggs.
My childhood was so difficult.

1909
01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:24.630
Did you buy me another drink?
Um,
I shit you not bill.
She was dead serious.

1910
01:58:25.590 --> 01:58:26.880
If that was not bad enough.

1911
01:58:26.881 --> 01:58:31.881
She argued with me for 15 fucking minutes telling me that rabbits laid eggs and

1912
01:58:32.611 --> 01:58:36.480
her proof to this was wait.
No.
He says wait for it.

1913
01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.690
If rabbits don't lay eggs and why does the Easter,

1914
01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:42.920
well then why does Easter have the Easter bunny and Easter eggs?

1915
01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:45.080
Wow.

1916
01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:50.080
This girl really took that Cadbury egg fucking story to heart from that point

1917
01:58:50.541 --> 01:58:54.350
on.
This girls 10 status dropped by a half.

1918
01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:58.010
I cannot even think about fucking this girl anymore.
To this day.

1919
01:58:58.011 --> 01:59:02.330
She's probably still so good looking that no dude ever told her that she was

1920
01:59:02.331 --> 01:59:07.190
wrong.
So he could just get in her pants and she's probably still tasting rabbit

1921
01:59:07.191 --> 01:59:11.170
pellets hoping for m and m's like,

1922
01:59:12.650 --> 01:59:15.980
yeah,
dude,
I that's,
that's a,

1923
01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:19.820
that's a strong fucking movie.
Your Age,
your age.

1924
01:59:19.821 --> 01:59:22.340
I probably would have still plowed through.
I don't,
I dunno.
I,

1925
01:59:22.341 --> 01:59:23.450
I always had that man.

1926
01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:26.030
I always had that thing that if I did not connect with somebody,

1927
01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:27.170
I do know something.

1928
01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:31.790
I tried to do what most guys do that basically,
you know,

1929
01:59:31.791 --> 01:59:34.850
fuck anything that moves and then they come back and they tell the horrific

1930
01:59:34.851 --> 01:59:38.900
story.
And uh,
I was never able to do that.
If I,

1931
01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:42.980
if there was like no connection,
like I've just never been able to,
uh,
oh,

1932
01:59:42.981 --> 01:59:45.800
that's a bullshit.
I got a couple in there.

1933
01:59:48.330 --> 01:59:51.660
I got a couple of Nice.
That's right.
Oh Jesus.
Am I going to tell this?

1934
01:59:51.661 --> 01:59:53.070
I can't fuck it.
Tell this story.

1935
01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:55.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1936
01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:58.520
<v 2>Okay.
Here we go.
You know what?
This is just bills a piece of shit.
Wake.
Okay.
Uh,</v>

1937
01:59:58.530 --> 02:00:03.390
yeah,
I got,
I didn't yell at the old guy,
you know,
the guy I was so,
you know,

1938
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:03.581
what is,

1939
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:06.370
I'm so upset with it or how that all guy thing meant that actually feel like I

1940
02:00:06.371 --> 02:00:11.320
yelled at him and I didn't even yell at him.
He's fucking yelling at me.
Um,

1941
02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:16.600
all right.
So I had the old guy incident.
I passed out during the second fucking

1942
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:23.500
quarter of the granddaddy of them off and a,
okay,
here's this story.

1943
02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:27.880
Uh,
early on in my life I rode career.

1944
02:00:29.170 --> 02:00:33.970
I was like,
I dunno,
I dunno how fuck Jesus Christ,
they have fat.

1945
02:00:33.971 --> 02:00:34.810
Fuck just sold them.

1946
02:00:35.410 --> 02:00:39.460
I love that when football players run into those fat guys who like their job is

1947
02:00:39.461 --> 02:00:43.540
to hold like that sound thing for the NFL films.
Um,

1948
02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:48.250
you know,
they feel that for weeks to anyways.
Um,

1949
02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:53.700
all right,
here's the story.
I think it was about 30 years old and,
uh,

1950
02:00:55.170 --> 02:00:58.470
I was doing this club and uh,

1951
02:00:58.471 --> 02:01:02.160
I was in this bar and the Jello shot girl comes by,

1952
02:01:02.161 --> 02:01:06.180
you know the Jello shot girl is always like fucking smoking hot,
you know,

1953
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:08.940
she has to be,
she's selling Jello.

1954
02:01:14.090 --> 02:01:17.550
Do you want to do a Jello shot?
No,
nobody does.

1955
02:01:17.551 --> 02:01:20.220
They just want to talk to you with your fucking ass and titties.

1956
02:01:20.850 --> 02:01:25.000
So this girl looked like a fucking Barbie doll.
Right?
He had a fucking ass.

1957
02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:29.630
Teddy's blonde hair,
just fucking gorgeous.
Right?
So,
uh,
I don't know what to Fau.

1958
02:01:29.690 --> 02:01:30.431
I remember what happened.

1959
02:01:30.431 --> 02:01:33.600
I did the classic when I had fucking zero game with women.

1960
02:01:33.601 --> 02:01:37.830
I just invited her out to a show working uncle fuckees down the street.

1961
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:40.460
And I got,
I like that age out.
So anyway,

1962
02:01:40.461 --> 02:01:45.290
she shows up the next night with a friend,
you know,
looking even better and uh,

1963
02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:49.140
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
Long story short,
at the end of the fucking night,

1964
02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.240
and when she showed up with like four other girls,

1965
02:01:51.241 --> 02:01:54.780
which was automatically a fucking problem,
but this girl was like,

1966
02:01:54.781 --> 02:01:58.560
she was raring to go.
I mean,
she sat down on my lap within fucking 10 minutes,

1967
02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:01.260
so I'm trying to get out of there,

1968
02:02:01.261 --> 02:02:05.400
but at a friend's keep fucking cock blocking me.
So long story short,

1969
02:02:05.401 --> 02:02:09.720
the night ends were in a parking garage.
All right.
I'm 30.

1970
02:02:09.721 --> 02:02:12.780
She's like fucking 18,
by the way.
19 maybe.

1971
02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:16.680
So I look like I'm fucking 106.
So,
uh,

1972
02:02:16.681 --> 02:02:19.020
all of her friends,
wait a minute,

1973
02:02:19.021 --> 02:02:21.690
she couldn't have been that young because she was serving Jello shots.

1974
02:02:21.691 --> 02:02:25.500
Was She 21?
Maybe I was like 32,
33.
I can't remember.

1975
02:02:25.501 --> 02:02:27.180
It's all fucking run together.
Whatever.

1976
02:02:28.830 --> 02:02:33.620
I was too fucking old to be with this girl.
Let's put it that way.
So,
um,

1977
02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:37.530
they're fucking,
uh,
it's the end of the night.
Okay.

1978
02:02:38.190 --> 02:02:41.970
And we're in the parking garage in a friends are telling her to get in the car

1979
02:02:41.971 --> 02:02:45.270
and she's like,
Nah,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna that back and go home with this guy.

1980
02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:48.120
And they go,
that's cool.
Just come over here and talk for a second.

1981
02:02:48.121 --> 02:02:52.620
And she walked over to the car and she sticks her head in the window and for,

1982
02:02:52.621 --> 02:02:54.240
I swear to God,
10 minutes,

1983
02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:58.560
they're trying to talk her out of not leaving with this creepy older guy.

1984
02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:02.280
And I'm standing there like an asshole.
And I was standing there for so long,

1985
02:03:03.450 --> 02:03:06.420
I started rooting for the girls in the car.
I'm like,
yeah,

1986
02:03:06.421 --> 02:03:08.490
come on and talk her out of it.
She shouldn't be here with me.

1987
02:03:08.491 --> 02:03:12.420
And of course they fucking didn't.
And uh,
you know,

1988
02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:15.840
and that you go and that's the podcast for the weekend.

1989
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:22.470
I did pour all my booze down the fucking sink except for the last bottle of

1990
02:03:22.471 --> 02:03:26.400
Scotch.
Alright,
go fuck yourself.
What am I a saint?
Maybe I do need Jesus.

1991
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:30.560
All right,
you guys have a great week.
And I,
I'm saying that jokingly,
right?

1992
02:03:30.570 --> 02:03:33.120
You fucking maniacs who keep emailing me.
Trying to get me into,
Gee,

1993
02:03:33.121 --> 02:03:36.570
I'm not into the guy.
All right.
Put a fucking shirt on and stop complaining.

1994
02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:39.510
All right.
Your father gave you the fucking ability to walk on water,

1995
02:03:39.511 --> 02:03:42.460
flowed off the fucking cross.
I didn't ask you to die for me.
All right.

1996
02:03:42.970 --> 02:03:47.760
You fucking martyr.
Um,
that's it.
Everybody have a great God damn week and,

1997
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:49.680
uh,
that's it.
Happy New Year

1998
02:03:51.010 --> 02:03:52.870

1999
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:41.900
