00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.360
It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.660
August fucking 27th August 27th what's going on?

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.940
How are you?
I'm you as you know,

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.920
I don't have a lot of guests on a,
on my podcast.

6
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:22.290
Every once in a while I'll have someone that interests me.

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.690
A middle leather chair.
I'm not like constantly farting here.

8
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.370
I'm just adjusting my weight.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.140
I have one of my oldest friends in this business.

10
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:35.070
I've known this man since 1,995 when we were a couple of,

11
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:39.960
nobody's going around fucking New York trying to get spots.
He has his name.
Oh,

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.130
I just introduce you.
Unbelievable comedian.
Mr Tom Papa.
Everybody.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.470
Nice to be here.
Bill 95.
That's amazing.

14
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:50.950
So I was only doing standup for two years when we miss that.
Right.

15
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:54.460
You were already really good.
93 I wasn't good.
I was loud.

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.330
I was loud and fast.
Well,
I remember,
uh,
Geraldo rest,

17
00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:01.990
his soul used to tell me that the way you used to stand on stage,

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.600
you were in some sort of like warrior one or warrior too.
It was sort of weird.

19
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.550
Lean,
I called it the lunge was at lunch.
I would like lean.
Yeah.

20
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:16.870
I would kinda like bend my one leg kind of lunch that way and talk to that part

21
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:20.000
of the audience.
Then I had lunch the other way.
Talk to him about it.
Got Laughs.

22
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.230
So yeah,
I really thought they'd probably like,
he's a character.

23
00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:25.870
He's thinking a character.
We can build a sitcom around this guy.
Look,

24
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.980
he's a young guy.
Like back then that was the whole thing.
Long bushy curly hair.

25
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.170
Ah,
um,
uh,
probably about 25 pounds heavier than I am now.
Oh,

26
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:38.170
you were heavier?
Yup.
And uh,
oh,
you were partying back then.

27
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.550
Who was like my crazy,
uh,
my wife calls it when she saw a tape of it.

28
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.000
She didn't know me back then.
She saw me probably 10 years after that.

29
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.313
And when she saw,

30
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.710
I don't know if you have like a good tape of you when you first started,

31
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:54.570
but there's like,
it's,
they're all also classic and uh,

32
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.380
she saw it and said it looked like my crazy brother showed up and came to town

33
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:03.480
and start doing comedy.
You're Roger Clinton showed up,
right?
Exactly.

34
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.420
I did kind of look Roger Clinton,
this had that kind of a,
almost a mullet,

35
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.430
but not really.
I got one in [inaudible],
I forget where the hell I was.

36
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.660
I was doing some local Boston show.
I mean it was taped,

37
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:18.280
someone's got to have the tape somewhere.

38
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.700
And I was wearing basically the clothes that I wore to the dental office that

39
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.270
day.
I was still working there.
I was definitely wearing the pants.
Right.

40
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.900
So I had like powder from the rubber gloves and God knows how much germs on me

41
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.180
cause I like the only way to make the Gig was I had to work and then just jump

42
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:39.340
in my car and go.
So I brought a chair,
a chair,
I brought a shirt.
So I had,
uh,

43
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.600
I had on navy blue Docker's.
Oh.
And then I had a shirt,

44
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.130
it was navy blue stripe and like,
like pea soup,

45
00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:50.740
green horizontal stripes.

46
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:55.741
I had a big red afro up him and a shirt tucked in.

47
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.260
Now grunge had already hit at that point.
Nice.

48
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.630
So I started [inaudible] 92 so it was already like Roger's already going.

49
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.840
So it was like if be tucked in your shirt,
you were part of the 80s.
Ugh.

50
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.160
So the shot I believe was on talked might not have been now that I think about

51
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.600
it,
but I was,
I just remember I was pointing at the crowd every like,

52
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.290
like Annunciation.
I was doing this thing.
You remember when Trump did that thing,

53
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:18.850
you're fired that little snake thing,

54
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.090
even with his hand and they made fun of it so much he stopped doing it.
Right.

55
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.630
Which is kind of funny to think about now.
It's interesting though,

56
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:29.740
you with the pointing as you're telling the jokes.
I mean,
even the lunging,
yes.

57
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.000
Uh,
because the two guys that I want it to be kind of bad ass,

58
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.470
like I didn't want to be like them,

59
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:40.471
but I can look back and think like Bill Hicks and Denis leary would get in the

60
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:44.680
audience's face and they would kind of like jab at them Kinda that way.
Oh,
okay.

61
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.300
Were you watching those guys at that time?

62
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.830
I didn't even know who bill Hicks was until after he died.
Oh really?
Well,
I mean,

63
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.340
because Bill Hicks was not getting on mainstream stuff.

64
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.980
He had done a couple of letterman's,
but back then,
you know,

65
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.550
if he didn't know to look for them,
if you missed his letter and spot,

66
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.630
he just missed it.
I found him by mistake on Caroline's comedy hour.

67
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.610
Oh,
okay.
To Caroline's comedy hour when Caroline's was down in another location,

68
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.860
I think by the seaport or something for a time.

69
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.890
Then I saw him and he would get like right in their face.

70
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:16.150
He would at the edge of the stage,

71
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.840
you bend all the way down with a cigarette in someone's face and yell about

72
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:23.540
Britney Spears or whatever.
No,

73
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.350
he was gone before Britney spears.
I felt it that time.

74
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.360
Like you have no materials so you just,

75
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.070
you know you're funny but you have no real skill.
You got some stuff,

76
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.440
but then it's just pure energy.

77
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.040
It's just what I think that that's because I was totally like introverted,

78
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:42.670
but so that,
that was me just sort of,
I think it was just,
that was me.

79
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.800
I was miming throwing shit against the wall.

80
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.800
I think every job that I was doing,

81
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.580
but then as we came up through the ranks,

82
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.810
what amazed me about you was the way that you could like always work.

83
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:01.930
Totally clean and like you,
I mean,
yeah,
we came up,
you know,

84
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:05.260
stu would be given us the late spots.
That's how it is.
You got to earn,

85
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.240
you got to earn the earlier ones.
Yeah.

86
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.580
And Iram you'd go on after Godfrey crushing,
you know all of these guys.

87
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.990
You go on after my filth and you'd go out there and just totally sport coat on,

88
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.310
sweet and clean.
Well and just bobbed and you just killed.

89
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.170
I did go through some phases when,

90
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.670
especially when it got to the seller where I was,
you know,

91
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.970
going up after a towel where F for a good month I thought I've gotta be dirtier.

92
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.700
I've got to,
yeah,
I've got to do something.

93
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.030
So I started coming up with filthier stuff and I'm telling you,

94
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:46.120
just the audience knew.
They don't know me at all.

95
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.860
That is not this guy.

96
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.890
They knew I was not the guy saying these words like it wasn't,

97
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.570
it did not fit.
And you know what's funny is,

98
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:59.760
is what you're saying right now is all you had to say after Dave.
Yeah.

99
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.920
Like I'd like to continue in that dark world,
but look at me folks.

100
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.360
I'm not,
that guy

101
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.430
didn't have the courage or the wherewithal to do that.

102
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.430
So my only cure for it was don't watch anybody before I go on.

103
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.750
Just to completely stay alone and wait for them to come and get me like last

104
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.330
minute.
Like,
Hey,
they're calling your name and then go down.

105
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.100
Isn't that amazing though?
But I think people that are successful will find ways,

106
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.700
you know,
in situations like that they actually come up,

107
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.300
they'll come up with their own sort of exercise yeah.
To be la.
Right.

108
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:39.260
Well if I just don't see it,
then I don't have to like deal with it.
Yeah.
And um,

109
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.990
some way to preserve whatever you got to kind of do.

110
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.950
I did some last week when I was on Conan.
Right?
Uh Huh.

111
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.260
I did something that I learned at the comedy cellar.

112
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.690
It was a comedy cellar is small as it is.
Yeah.

113
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.850
It always seems so gigantic to me because it was like this place you wanted to

114
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:58.250
get into st would be watching your sets.

115
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.110
The fucking wait staff would report back to management and Shit and you just

116
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.450
never felt like you know it,

117
00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:07.730
it takes a good eight years before you feel like you're in.
He did.
Totally.

118
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.170
So I remember Patrice had done something on stage.

119
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.970
I don't know what happened.
He had done something,
so they called a meeting.

120
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.170
It was,
this is fucking hilarious.
They call this meeting at the comedy cellar.

121
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.950
Okay.
And the three people showed up.
I don't all the comics.

122
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.720
It was me and Bobby.
I was living with Bobby Kelly,
Bobby's idea.

123
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.660
We got to go to the meeting,
she's going to take away I spots and I'm like,

124
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:37.130
I yelled again.
And we both went down there,
frick and frack to Boston guys.

125
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:41.480
We'd go down there.
It was us two and David Tell,
oh my God,
Patrice,

126
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.510
who the whole fucking meeting was about,
didn't even show up of course.

127
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.220
And everybody else was kind of in and it's like,

128
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:47.990
I got to get a fucking going down there.
But anyway,

129
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.980
we went in there and I remember waiting for a sec and Manny to get their rest,

130
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.870
his soul.
And I just was,
I was apps,

131
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.790
it was the middle of the day and I could not believe how small the club was.

132
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.330
Right.
And I was just like,
oh my God.
I mean I could literally,
yeah.

133
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.640
Move all the chairs out of here in 11 minutes by myself.
Yeah.

134
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:10.430
With sometimes I'll go down to,
to go to use the restroom even now.

135
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.860
And you go down there and it's just empty.

136
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.170
And everything's pushed aside so they can mop.

137
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.910
And it really is like a closet and it's because when,

138
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.870
I don't know what it is about that room.
Yeah.
When it gets full,
it's matching.

139
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.000
Yes.
And it just,
it comes this other,

140
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:32.450
this energy thing that you're just like,
and then when it's,
everybody's gone.

141
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.390
Yeah.
And they're like going like,
this is this place.
It's like,
you know,

142
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.890
so anyway,
so I went,

143
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.300
I had to go to Conan and I just so happened I was ready for once before the,

144
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.640
you know,
right.
It's the guy got there to pick you up.
Ah.

145
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.370
So I got there like 15 minutes early.
There was nobody there,

146
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.030
so I was like,
you know,
how would you just walk out there?

147
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:52.210
Why don't I just walk out and take a look at it?
Yeah.

148
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.530
Just so I can really have in my head how big it is.
Oh,
nice.
You know,

149
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.570
it was still pretty big and that's
what I mean.

150
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.140
But it wasn't like it's your space.
I want it to be more grounded.
Right.

151
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.720
So I went up,
I looked at the drum kit and stuff,
sat down,

152
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:10.890
played for like two seconds and then like walked around and talked to a couple

153
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:14.730
of people.
A few people said hello.
And then it just kind of felt like,

154
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:18.520
and I was just looking at smart.
Yeah.
That's so smart.
Yeah.

155
00:09:18.521 --> 00:09:21.420
So cause even when you leave,
you've done the show a bunch,

156
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.690
but when you could walk back out it feels new again.
It's not your home.
Yes.

157
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:29.940
So I did the new again thing before the cameras were on.
Nice.
And then,

158
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:34.680
so then when I went out there,
I felt like I was,
you know,
the most present.

159
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.510
I didn't have that same outer body experience where afterwards I had,

160
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.750
would always look at Andy and be like,
was that good?
Like,

161
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.180
like basically what happened.
I totally,
because the whole time you're doing it,

162
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:47.740
you're thinking like nowadays too,
it's like,

163
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.990
did I just end my fucking career right there?
What did I say?
You know,

164
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.680
is this group going to come at me or fad people going to say this?
Like,
you know,

165
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.560
all of that shit.
So anyway,
speaking of careers,

166
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.370
yes you are on this podcast.
Not Cause you liked me.

167
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.000
Well not because she wanted to come over here and smoke a cigar afterwards with

168
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:09.780
some finding out you don't have time.
Oh I wish Tom Papa.
Um,

169
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.930
not only an incredible comedian.
You also bake your own bread.
Yes I do.

170
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.750
Which you've been doing for years and then you,

171
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.180
you were actually nice enough to offer to teach me and I've just never found

172
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:24.420
time to get over there.
And I brought you bread.
Oh you like a year ago.

173
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.970
You remember I brought it.
Oh like two times.

174
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.210
I vaguely remember cause it's gone that quick and it brings it over in a little

175
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:34.060
basket with this old lady.
Little towel over the top of it.
And you're like,
ah,

176
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.820
like you don't even need butter.
You made us say,
what did you make us?

177
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.320
I always get a sour sour dough.
Ah,
good stuff.

178
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.071
I got good for me.

179
00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:47.550
And Nia basically ate the whole loaf talking about what we were going to eat it

180
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:50.370
with that night.
And we were just not the old and we were like,

181
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:55.270
we got to finish this.
So now all of a sudden,
yeah.
Um,
your,

182
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.850
your professional and your hobby life have now blurred here and you have a new

183
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:04.620
cooking show coming out today,
I guess,
right?
Monday a week.

184
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.090
A week from Labor Day.
Labor Day.
So a week from today,
what's the exact date?
Uh,

185
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:12.450
September 3rd,
third day.
10 o'clock at night.

186
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.140
10 o'clock east called baked.
It's called baked.
And No,

187
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:20.560
you're not putting any weed in the bread,
man.
Hey Man.
Um,
uh,

188
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.420
yeah,
it's not really a cooking show as much as a food show.

189
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.190
Like I'm not going to,
well I guess I,
I guess I am cooking basically what I did.

190
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.240
Well,
it's not going to be eight episodes of watching you cook bread.
No.
Okay.

191
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:37.020
Exactly.
That's,
uh,
that's kind of what I thought it was going to be.

192
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.270
And they're like,
this is going to be over in an episode.

193
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.050
So you have a hundred different kinds of loaves of bread you can make,

194
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.070
so we can get there to syndication.
So what I was doing,

195
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.270
I started baking it.

196
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.960
I started getting really good at it and when I would travel around on the road

197
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.480
doing stand during the day,
I would visit bakeries.

198
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.140
I would go check them out and I was just trying to learn like see what flower

199
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:03.070
they were using,
talk to them,
that kind of thing.
Yeah,
you got into it.

200
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.100
I got into it and they caught wind of it and thought it would be a cool show

201
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.180
because I'm already doing it.

202
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:13.420
I'm going to these places and then you know I'm going to learn.

203
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.750
I'm super curious about it and they didn't have any show that just dealt with

204
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:19.960
baked goods.
Can you back up for a second?
How did they catch wind of it?

205
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.350
I have that Alexis in your fucking house or something.

206
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.580
How do they catch wind and you're a comic killing a day and you're going to

207
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.940
bakeries,
because I started talking about it on social media.

208
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.460
I talked about an on Rogan's podcast.

209
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.760
I talked about it on Conan and in the New York Times did an article on people

210
00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:47.050
with sourdough starters.
You know,
the sourdough starter is the mother,

211
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.830
the mother.
I hate that.
I hate that.
I saw,
it's the thing,
there's,

212
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:54.260
there's like a thing in France,
the,
some of them have,
they're like a,

213
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.810
they're like a couple hundred years old.

214
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.260
Like you just keep feeding it some sort of bacteria or no,

215
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:03.820
you just keep feeding it flour and in water and it eats it.

216
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.250
And what that season alive.
Yeah.
It's the act of yeast in there.

217
00:13:07.251 --> 00:13:09.490
And so you've got to feed it flour and water and it eats it.

218
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.610
And so it's like they've had a goldfish that they'd been feeding for like the

219
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:15.310
last since like the early 18 hundreds.
Yeah.

220
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:19.210
And it's a little vague that when people say it's a hundred years old,
I mean,

221
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:23.730
cause you like nobody ever is spelt it,
it has its origin.
Like it has it,

222
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.280
you will have,
it will connect to however long you've been feeding it,

223
00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:30.820
but you're dumping a lot of it and then new flower and water's going in.

224
00:13:30.821 --> 00:13:35.020
But just a cool story.
Yeah.
You know,
and uh,

225
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.720
now I feel like a novice,
like people do care about it.

226
00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:42.250
People do like hang on to them,
pass them down to other people in their family.

227
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:44.610
And it is a thing like you,
my,

228
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.490
I have two of them and they're in my refrigerator and I've been on the road now

229
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:49.240
for a week.

230
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.240
I just got home today and I know when I leave you I'm going to go home and feed

231
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:56.560
them cause it's been a week.
If you don't feed it,

232
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.750
it slowly starts to become less active.

233
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:03.751
It has no food to eat and then it starts creating its own alcohol and that's it.

234
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.390
When you come back,
there'll be like a layer of alcohol on top of it.

235
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.900
Now it's all solving Looch you're like a micro brewer.
Yeah,
exactly.
Oh,

236
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:15.310
it's literally called who literally is how pure alcohol booze got called hooch.

237
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.660
Yeah.
It's a fermentation.

238
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.890
This is already the most informative podcasts I've ever done.

239
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:22.840
That's fucking awesome.

240
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.580
So the New York Times did an article on people with their sourdough starters and

241
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.900
just,
you know,

242
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.830
I've been doing it for like a year and they came into my house and took pictures

243
00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.980
of me with my starter and I was in the food section.
This is,

244
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.320
I'm not doing anything,
show busy with this.

245
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.260
I'm just baking bread with my daughter having,

246
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.600
isn't that always how it comes about when you,
when you're not trying not at all.

247
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:44.613
And uh,

248
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.070
my friends back east well for the New York Times and then calling me that day,

249
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:54.670
like,
what are you doing?
Why are you in the food section?

250
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.260
So it just became a thing and then people started sending me things.

251
00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:02.480
I'm Twitter and Facebook or whatever,
uh,

252
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.700
showing me that there are attempts at baking like,

253
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.830
and that's a massive subculture.
Yeah.

254
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.780
It's not even just people who bake like specifically big bread.
Yeah.

255
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.490
People who are into bourbons like this,

256
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:20.630
all of these subcultures thing that when you all of a sudden get into it.

257
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.300
Totally.
Yeah.
You just be like open the door a little bit.

258
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:25.490
All of a sudden you see those like,
you know,
a million people and they're like,

259
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.010
yeah,
yeah.
You're like,
wow,

260
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.110
look at all these Instagram accounts of people doing what I'm doing.

261
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.320
Is it just kind of,
uh,
took off and was super fun.

262
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.490
And I also,
at the same time that I started baking it,

263
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.450
I also started getting on this kick of,
uh,

264
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.840
this is why are we the first generation it Brett has been around for thousands

265
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.620
of years.
Why are we the generation that's being told we shouldn't eat bread?

266
00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.300
Why all of a sudden are we now like,
no,

267
00:16:00.301 --> 00:16:03.810
you're the new human beings that can't eat bread.
And I was like,

268
00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:06.510
there's something wrong here.
And then when we started baking this bread,

269
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.150
it's just flour,
water,
salt and yeast.
That's all it's in it.

270
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:10.680
And wouldn't the bread I would buy,

271
00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:14.310
my daughter's in the supermarket trying to get them good bread,

272
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.320
had 30 ingredients in it,
right?
Chemicals,
sugars,

273
00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:23.530
glucose,
all this other isis.
Yeah.
I said it was all in there.
Yeah,

274
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.560
Russian poison.
It was [inaudible].

275
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.910
And I started giving that breadths of my friends that have problems with eating

276
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.380
bread and they had no problems.

277
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.640
We were eating a lot of bread and we weren't getting fat and I was like this is

278
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:42.890
the pure thing,
this is what bread really is.

279
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.960
So then I started going off on this kick in my acts and it started,

280
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.860
you know,
a permeating other parts of,

281
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.870
it was in my book where I was just like we should be allowed to celebrate in

282
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:59.110
life.
We should be allowed in.
Can I pitch an episode?
Yes.

283
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.770
An episode.
Cause you got eight already in the can.
Okay.
You're next season.

284
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.630
Tom Teaches bill how to bake bread or even just right.

285
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.270
Even just for the website.
That would be awesome.

286
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.800
I am on this new diet that I've been doing for like the last three weeks and

287
00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:15.820
I've been,
you know,

288
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.840
keeping the muscle and dropping all the fat and I love how I look and everything

289
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.950
but it's just like I,
you know,
am I come,

290
00:17:22.951 --> 00:17:25.930
I've got to have a piece of bread every once in a while.
Every once in a while.

291
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.640
And you eat are what,
okay,
I'll do the shit that I used to.
You know,

292
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.240
you're part of my generation.
You know,
I always wonder bread mice,

293
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:39.160
steak comes on wonder bread and the grease would be going through the brand.

294
00:17:39.161 --> 00:17:41.360
You have to eat it quick before it went through.
Oh yeah.
You know,

295
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:45.430
how are we going to look up a fork or something?
I um,
and I stand by dude,

296
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.440
I had that today.
I would have to take a nap immediately,

297
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:53.490
but it would be effing delicious and a child's sense.
Memory Foam,

298
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:58.220
but your stuff.
Yeah.
Um,
IHR brand.

299
00:17:58.221 --> 00:18:02.460
I was like,
I got to call my parents.
I mean it was just,
it was just like,

300
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.230
it was like a wholesome,
yeah.
Holidays,
everything that like,
you know,
when,

301
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:11.220
when all the bs slows down in life,
the right it,
you know,

302
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.850
you just got passed something or maybe it's the holidays,

303
00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:15.570
you've got a few days off,
he just have time.

304
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:18.840
But you actually have free time to hang with the people in your life.

305
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.670
Like this is what it's and so could be.
Right,
exactly.
This is what it could be.

306
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:27.120
And it's not every day.
I mean these are special moments in your life,
you know?

307
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.200
I mean,
basically the way the show goes is I,

308
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.160
I just pictured you talking to your family.
Like,
don't get Yost today.

309
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.160
It's a special thing.
It,
there's bread in the house all the time now.

310
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.890
Like when I go on the road,
if I'm gone for a while,

311
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.040
they get for the first time they call me.
They're like,

312
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:46.730
when you coming back and it's not because he wasn't seen.

313
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.000
Do you realize your kids,

314
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:53.260
they're going to talk about you like some like grandmother from the early 1900

315
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.310
stone.
There was always the smell of bread in our house.
That's right.
I'm out.

316
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.640
I'll always remember her.
I remember her when she passed the casket.

317
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:07.020
The smells like he's just disgusting.
Sorry,
I should have said bread.

318
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.110
It just took a whole nother angle on there.
So what's your favorite?
Uh,

319
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.460
so basically I go around to all these different cities.

320
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:19.461
I come into a city and I visit five of the best big goods I can find a bakery.

321
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.910
I'm a sandwich place with amazing roles,
a pizza place,
whatever it is.
Okay,

322
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.380
what paid.

323
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.330
We're dealing with doe and that kind of thing and you quickly realize this back

324
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:34.380
to it being special,
you quickly realize there doesn't,

325
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.370
there's no need for a bakery in a town.
You know what I mean?
Like there's,

326
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.820
you need the cops,
you need the fire department,
you need the power,

327
00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.790
you need the the water,
you'd eat all this stuff.

328
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.880
A bakery is a special little place that's just happens to be in the town that

329
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:53.280
when you're want to treat yourself or get something nice for your family,

330
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.870
that's when you go to the bakery.

331
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.430
It's this nice little celebration in your everyday life.

332
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.920
You don't go there every day,
you know most of the time.

333
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.940
So all these people are creating this really special stuff and you go in there

334
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.590
and you feel good and that you should be celebrating your life like this is it

335
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.840
like this.
We're not going to,
this is prime time,
right?

336
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.460
This is when we're really going to enjoy ourselves.

337
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.140
You take your daughter and walk into a bakery and give her a cookie.

338
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.540
That is a special moment.
That's a special thing.
You know when she,

339
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.320
when she turned a year and a half last month,
I actually,

340
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:35.340
I went to a bakery and I bought her a cupcake and put one and a half candles in

341
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:39.390
it and sang happy one and a half years old.
My God,

342
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.890
she's just looking at me like,
when can I eat the theater?

343
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.810
Nice Song that I dunno what's going on here and get one thing.
Can I have that?

344
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.110
Yeah,
this is special for you.
But I really feel like,
uh,

345
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.970
it's,
it's just,
it's a celebration.
Life should be a celebration.

346
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.060
You don't eat this stuff all the time.
You don't want to,
you know,
you,

347
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.530
you want to be in shape.
You don't want to get diabetes,
but you should enjoy it.

348
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.140
We'll do an episode,
I'll teach you how to make a pie crust.

349
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:07.690
You teach me how to make bake some bread and that would be great.

350
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.980
We should do it now.
I gotta be honest with you.
Like I,
I just,
uh,

351
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.860
the whole idea of having a comedian who bakes,
you know,
it's weird,
right?
No,

352
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.950
I'm just saying,
I'm like,
what a home run for a show.
Oh,
right.

353
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.860
And then you're going to go check out all these cool bakeries.
Like I dunno,
like,

354
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:25.550
Hey,
I've had diners drive it and then tides.

355
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:29.740
It just seems like everybody's always eating like the Burgers,
the Tacos,

356
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:32.770
the Burritos,
the pizza.
They've had all of those shows.

357
00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:37.420
But I haven't seen a guy big do the bakeries now and like,
you know,

358
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.760
for years.
Yeah.
I've been,
you know,

359
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:44.100
sort of like a gay bashed in a way that I actually know how to bake and make

360
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:48.310
pies and stuff.
And I'm like,
why?
It's awesome.
And Women Love Ya.
I remember,

361
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.940
do you know how to bake?
Like they love?
Oh,
completely.
There's a whole,

362
00:21:51.941 --> 00:21:55.450
there was a whole article about a woman that get turned on by and these guys

363
00:21:55.451 --> 00:21:58.450
that bake bread,
remember?
You were so literally,
it's like,

364
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.800
it's like having a saint for me because I'm such an asshole.

365
00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.110
It takes down a lot of my shit that I do.
You know what I mean?
If like,

366
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.230
you know what's the edge off?
Yeah.
Like make a scene at the supermarket.
He yells,

367
00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:13.740
he's cutting people off,
but he makes a hell of a pie.

368
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.770
Even your voice changed and makes a hell of a fun,
take some of the edge off you.

369
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:24.670
Uh,
you brought up high.
Was it last Christmas?

370
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.740
Was it around the holidays?
I can't remember.

371
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:31.600
Brought me a pie and the center wasn't cooked.
And you also,

372
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.380
you were so bummed out.
I'm going to tell you why.

373
00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:36.910
Because we were renting a house.
Can I get my shit hole one fixed up.

374
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.660
And what happened was the door was slightly ajar and let the heat out.

375
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.720
No,
I made you,
I'm still remember,
send me a picture of it.
I made you.
Yeah,

376
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:50.950
cause I felt so bad.
I made you a uh,
pumpkin bread for Halloween.

377
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.820
That's where I made,
and it's the easiest fucking thing.
It's just a concoction.

378
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:57.910
You pour it in the thing,
you throw it the oven and you're done and you leave it.

379
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.500
Yeah.
And it w it wasn't done.

380
00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:02.470
So I had to tell you to put it back in and you were able to fix it though.

381
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:06.820
But I was,
I was so embarrassed.
And then the fact that you're like this,

382
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:09.100
you know me is such a good baker.
You're it,

383
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:11.100
you're in the food section of the Times.

384
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.310
I get a couple of hits on Facebook when I make a pie,
but,
but you know what,

385
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.190
I remember that distinctly.

386
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.340
Like we just ate around the raw part and it was delicious.

387
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.660
That's the cool thing.
Like you don't realize you messed this stuff up.

388
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.730
I still screw up reds cause it takes,

389
00:23:27.731 --> 00:23:30.580
it's a three day process and if you mess up along the way,

390
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.590
you're going to get a flat frisbee.

391
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.420
But I'm telling you the flat Frisbee is delay.
Oh,
still is.
Yeah.
Just push.

392
00:23:37.421 --> 00:23:41.350
It doesn't look good.
Just put some butter on it.
You just,
Oh yeah.
God.

393
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.380
What have you been up to as far as,
uh,
you,
you've been traveling the road,

394
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.770
promoting the show.
You've been doing some dates,
what he'd been up to had a,
uh,

395
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.180
yeah,
it's,
it's not really slowed down.
I have.
Um,

396
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.600
I had five jobs from April until just recently where I was doing my standup of

397
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:03.740
course.
And then I had a book come out,

398
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.960
so I had to tour around with the book.

399
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.490
I took over the writing for live from here,
which was prairie home companion,

400
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.420
Gerritsen retired.
And um,

401
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.580
Christy Lee took over as the host and uh,

402
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:21.170
I took over the comedy of it and the writing of it.
And uh,

403
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.800
I also do a monologue each week on it.
And then,
um,

404
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.610
and then I had my podcasts might come to pop up podcast and radio show for

405
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:32.390
Sirius and uh,
and then baked.
And then when they,

406
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.060
when the red show came,
you know,

407
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:37.730
as happens in production,

408
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.990
they are like,
yeah,
we might make it,
we might make it.
And they're like,

409
00:24:41.991 --> 00:24:43.850
we want eight in a month.

410
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:49.100
So on top of touring with the radio show and with my standup and the book tour,

411
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.730
the bread show got thrown on top of it.
So the bread show,

412
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:54.140
you probably think I'm insane.
Can't going to go.

413
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:57.000
It's a fun little thing that I'll do.
It's fine.
We'll do a pilot,

414
00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.290
throw me a couple of bucks.
This is cool.
We'll do a pilot.
Who knows?
You know,

415
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.183
I wasn't,
I,

416
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:07.030
the beautiful part of this is I have no show Biz anxiety about this.

417
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:11.930
I still don't,
I still don't.
I everything else,
you know,

418
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.310
you make stuff,
you sell it,
you try and get it on the air.
You push.
Yeah.

419
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.890
But I also think if you tore her comic and you have your own podcast,

420
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.380
you're making enough money that I don't have any showbiz stress where I love

421
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:27.230
doing my TV show.
Absolutely love doing it.
But like,

422
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:32.060
I'm not like in the unemployment line,
right.
If it doesn't go,
yeah.

423
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.230
If it doesn't go,
which I hope it goes by the way,
if anybody's listening.
Yeah.

424
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.430
Yeah.
And just treat drone out there.
He's not appreciating her.
Cheryl.

425
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.560
Um,
yeah.
But this show I completely,
I'm like,
look,

426
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.810
we can do a show about it.
That'd be great.

427
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:50.330
I'd love to share it with more people that,
that's awesome.

428
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.190
If you don't make a show about it,

429
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.070
I'm still gonna go to the bakery in Cleveland when I get there.

430
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.090
You know what I mean?
So how much time did she said did you buy,

431
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.010
did you have to carve out a USP,
a schedule and keep doing it?

432
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.850
I just threw it on top of everything else.
So while I was doing the book tour,

433
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.710
while I was doing the standup,
I was doing all this other stuff.

434
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.440
I was doing episodes of this show,
uh,

435
00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.050
that are going to start airing.

436
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:17.380
And I literally have not been in my home for a full week since April.

437
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.300
Oh my God.
Yeah.
It would just,
it just all,
it was like a tsunami.
Everything,

438
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.750
a perfect storm.
It all just hit at the same time.
How do you handle that?

439
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.063
I just go,

440
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:33.020
I just go and having a family is,
uh,

441
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.140
and uh,
you know,
I want to be with them and literally bill,

442
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.980
my kids are 16 and 13 now and I was like,

443
00:26:39.981 --> 00:26:44.380
I literally before all of this stuff hit the fan.
I literally said to myself,

444
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.450
I'm going to be smarter about how I tour.

445
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.770
These are the only a couple more years here before everybody starts taking off

446
00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:55.060
on their own.
I'm going to be around a little bit more.
Yeah.
And Boom,

447
00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.950
as soon as I said it I was gone.
Huh.
And so that's,
that's the industry.

448
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.830
I know you young people in the industry just say out loud.
You know what,

449
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:04.680
I'm going to move back east.
Just say that now.

450
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.160
The showbiz Unifor universe will let you move back east.
Yeah.
But let you got it.

451
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.240
I'll get you something.
After you've given up your apartment and all that,

452
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.440
did that just happen you,
was that just having a Dean del Rey?
Oh yeah.

453
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.560
Dean del Ray's like,
I'm getting all these seeds by coastal now,
but he's,

454
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:20.550
so he went to New York,

455
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:23.150
like I'm going to be out there for a while doing spots a minute.
The seller,

456
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.340
Blah Blah.
Dude.
He gets to use it for like two weeks.

457
00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:30.600
They got Konan Konan he's got to come back.
It's hilarious.
Actually.

458
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:34.820
He's on Conan tonight with Mark Marin's.
I'm going to try to go over there for,

459
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.860
for the taping.
Yeah.
That'll be fun.
These,
he's such a good guy.

460
00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.810
He's got an dean.
Uh,
you know,
I haven't watched him that much,

461
00:27:43.811 --> 00:27:47.860
but over the last,
you know,
several years he just got you just,

462
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.720
some guys just turn the corner.

463
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.150
They just know exactly what they're starting to do.

464
00:27:52.151 --> 00:27:55.600
Like he got so tuned into his voice.
Yeah.
He's just,

465
00:27:55.601 --> 00:28:00.460
he's Dean onstage and offstage.
Yeah.
He's,
he's a killer now.
Now he opens for me.

466
00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:05.300
He gets,
he gets like sustained rounds of applause when he's done through.

467
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.660
I had to go on after him and Todd rex,
you ever go on at the Todd rex?
No.

468
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.820
Fucking monster.
Oh really?
Yeah.
And both,
you know,
taught as this thing.

469
00:28:12.821 --> 00:28:17.020
What did people love him?
Yeah.
Like he's one of these,
these like a big kid.

470
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.530
Kids love them and adults love him and he is like,

471
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.950
he's like a legit headliner.
Wow.

472
00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.480
And what bothers guys on before you?
Yeah,
I did.

473
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.910
But what's good is all but then people come out like a,

474
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.110
and they get to see like a full show rather than some,
you know,

475
00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.940
some cupcake you put on in front of you that's up there.
Hey,

476
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.520
whether it's been crazy.
Yeah.
Do you have an notice with raindrops?

477
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.010
Some are bigger than others.
I did a show last night and I am,
uh,

478
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.220
in there the other night and I'm a Michigan Northern Michigan and it was as a

479
00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:57.910
performing arts center.
This nice theater,
beautiful place up in like,

480
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.840
I've never been that nice bakery.
Uh,

481
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.520
no opener.
No,
I just walked out and just did it.

482
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.090
It was kind of lonely like hanging out during the day and stuff.
But um,

483
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.690
I have to say it was kind of you have to do more time.
You know,

484
00:29:13.691 --> 00:29:17.200
you're doing more like an hour and a half,
but uh,

485
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:22.360
I really liked it.
Yeah,
we'll do that.
Yeah.

486
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.160
Well I do like 90 minutes anyway on top of those guys.
Yeah.

487
00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:31.180
But if I have one guy does like 15,
if I have two guys who both to 10.
Okay.

488
00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.520
And I'm trying like,
but you ever just walk out,

489
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.850
you ever just go with nobody?
Yes.

490
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.340
Have I done nobody on the road?
I,

491
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.320
I'm only a few times in my career it becomes a different thing.

492
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.490
It is a different thing.
I think it would be weird at a club.
Uh,
yes.

493
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.930
Just because of what the club does.

494
00:29:49.931 --> 00:29:53.920
So much commotion going on and there's so many drinks.
She got to get out.

495
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:58.210
So much food to get out and all the fuck all that pomp and circumstance has to

496
00:29:58.211 --> 00:30:01.030
happen.
There's a lot going on.
And then when the headliner comes on,

497
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:04.520
it's like now we have your undivided attention until we drop all the checks.

498
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.380
So there's always commotion going on with the clubs.
But like in a theater,

499
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.400
I think,
um,
if he comes in the evening with rather than yeah.

500
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:15.970
Show like I saw,
uh,
who did I see,

501
00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.680
I saw Billy Connolly,

502
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.600
I saw him in New York about 10 years ago and if I remember,
yeah,

503
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.730
cause he did like two hours.
Yeah,
he did two fucking hours.

504
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.760
It was unbelievable.
And like at that point that's when guys would kind of like,

505
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:32.710
if you did like an hour,
I was like,
wow.
Yeah.

506
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:37.730
Do you mean when headlining was 45 minutes?
Everybody did?
45 45 that's,
yeah.

507
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.060
Insane.
Fucking joke.
In same.

508
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.740
I feel like now if I don't do like an hour and 20 I'm ripping them off.
You know,

509
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.800
and I know.
Yeah.
It's what weird thing,

510
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:52.720
you know what's weird about it too is that it's kind of like when you do
pushups,

511
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.760
like if you say you're going to do 20 pushups,
18 1920 are really hard.

512
00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:02.950
If you tell yourself you're doing 25 all of a sudden 2124 25 or art like,

513
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.470
it's all about that.

514
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.840
80 to 90 to 125 is going to see like a fucking zillion miles away,

515
00:31:10.841 --> 00:31:14.410
but I know what you mean.
You're shooting.
Yeah,
it just your head,

516
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:18.130
your head does something.
You say,
I'm going to go do an hour and a half tonight.

517
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.650
That's just the way it is.
If you say you're doing an hour,

518
00:31:20.651 --> 00:31:23.350
all of a sudden you're panting to get to an hour.
All right.
Hey,

519
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:25.330
you want to answer some questions here?
If you want to help me out,

520
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:28.180
I give people advice on this.
This podcast.
Yeah,
of course.
You know,

521
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:32.480
if any of this is going to ruin your bread shelf,
they just let me know.
I'll,

522
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.270
I'll give you.
So last week I,
uh,
somebody mentioned that,
you know,
I actually,

523
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.870
my dumb ass,
I went on,
like,
I was like,
let's see what's going on in the world,

524
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:45.940
you know,
and,
um,
I don't even know if I want to drag you into this,

525
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:50.941
but like Trump said that said that killing white farmers in a,

526
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.090
in South Africa,
which has been happening for while.
And I never condoned it.

527
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.220
I didn't say it wasn't a big deal.
I would just,

528
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.900
I was talking about what he pays attention to,
which,
you know,

529
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:05.290
I don't think if they were Puerto Rican farmers,
he would give a fuck.

530
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.130
And I am,
call me a reverse racist,

531
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:14.131
but I am basing that on the fact that when there was regular people and then neo

532
00:32:14.371 --> 00:32:17.080
Nazis involves,
he was sitting there going like,
well,
you know,

533
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:21.920
you can kind of see both sides of the story.
Yeah.
So anyways,
uh,

534
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.700
so this guy wrote,
he wrote in from Cape Town.

535
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:29.140
So we got a bunch of people from Europe saying,
no,
but blood,
blood,
blood,
blood,

536
00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:31.810
blood,
blood.
You know,
they're just like make then they're not there.
Right.

537
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.100
So we didn't listen to them.
All right,
so this guy,
some Kate time right there.
Uh,

538
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.980
how's it going,
Billy?
Uh,
I'm from,
I'm from Cape Town Africa.
I'm a big

539
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.120
<v 1>fan.
I listen to your podcasts every week.
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
Care for a visit.</v>

540
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.920
I'd love to,
I'd love to go there.
I'd go there.

541
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.380
I have two topics I want to put out there.
First,

542
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:52.670
my country got some airtime in the news last week due to a tweet by the Donald

543
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.550
Guy.
Now just to recap,
I don't know what this guy's tone is,

544
00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:57.110
but I've read some of the other ones that are all like,

545
00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:01.010
why don't you fucking read a bad,
but they hamper your mouth.
All right.

546
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.181
Now just to recap,

547
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:07.181
he basically mentioned investigating far murders in land expropriation without

548
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:11.930
payment and South Africa based on race.
Why are we getting involved in this?
Yeah,

549
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:13.640
I know.
Why are we getting an invite anyways?
Yeah,

550
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.600
I bet one of the farmers was going to sell him land to build a golf course.

551
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.290
We have to stop it.
All right.
News outlets like BBC,
CNN,

552
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.620
etc. Were quick to point out that these claims were baseless.

553
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.600
And then if you look at the crime statute,

554
00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:29.390
actually see it decline in the farm based attacks though.
I don't look,

555
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:34.210
I don't watch he got into it because a Tucker Carlson did a thing on it.
Oh I,

556
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.460
you know what I should cause I don't watch the news because all it does is give

557
00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:40.790
me angry.
It's just,
it's a half hour of anxiety with no solution.
Yeah.

558
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.920
And then all this shit that I wasn't worried about,

559
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:45.570
I now have to add to the shit I already was worried about.

560
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.440
So why would I do it to myself?
Yeah.
And you're powerless to do anything.

561
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.760
All right.
Just to set the record state,

562
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:53.690
I can tell you that if you search deeper and speak the to the average South

563
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.860
African,
they would tell you a different story.
Being a farmer,

564
00:33:55.861 --> 00:33:58.880
a farm worker is by far the most dangerous job you can have around here due to

565
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:02.600
the number of attacks and the cold blooded blooded barbaric nature of these

566
00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:04.520
attacks.
Uh,

567
00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:07.410
there is no doubt that the number of attacks has grown in number and in,

568
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.230
in brutality in recent years.

569
00:34:09.231 --> 00:34:12.050
Yet these attacks are not widely reported in the accuracy.

570
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.730
The statistics on the farmers have been appointed dispute ever since the end of

571
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:19.340
apartheid.
Anyone you talk to?
Uh,
yeah.

572
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.520
The whole fucking thing is there was brutal attacks to get the land and then a

573
00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:29.570
brutal form of government and now there's a brutal reaction to it is my limited

574
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:32.360
understanding to it.
And I'm not saying any of that was right.

575
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:38.170
I was just saying it's interesting what old the orange headed lunatic decides to

576
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:41.510
pay attention to.
Right,
exactly.
That's all I'm saying.
I mean this is,

577
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.940
and I've even said the last election was 2:00 AM at a bar.
Right?

578
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.110
You had to go home with somebody.
You didn't want to leave with either one,

579
00:34:48.111 --> 00:34:50.300
but you had to leave with somebody.
So I am not,

580
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.370
I am not picking a side politically Irena Shit.
Anyways,

581
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.350
anyone you talked to can tell,
tell you have multiple,

582
00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:01.670
multiple of their close friends or relatives who have been attack,
uh,

583
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.370
but effective by an attack regardless of rate brace.

584
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:09.050
Yet this is not helped by the fact that many political rallies or met with

585
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:12.640
chance of kill the Bora,
the farmer killed a farmer.

586
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.640
These political parties are basically garnering support on the false promise of

587
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:19.520
land and wealth to everyone.
Yay.
Communism.

588
00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:23.240
What do you mean gay communism that happened in our country,
man,

589
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:26.210
we got to rebel against these English guys and then all the rich fucks once we

590
00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:30.350
kicked him out and moved into the rich guys houses.
Right.
And continues to taxes.

591
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.870
This is,
I love when they blamed forms of government.
Yeah.

592
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.040
Is there a form of government that works?
I don't think there is because every,

593
00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.070
because you get

594
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.720
<v 0>at the end you have human beings with unchecked power on some level at the top</v>

595
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:44.430
and it just,
that's right.
That's all we are.

596
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.330
Some people taste the good life and they don't want to give it back.
No,
no.

597
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.310
That's what's going on in Nicaragua right now.

598
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.170
What's going on about someone else's problems?

599
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.460
It's basically the students are rioting and trying to take the government back

600
00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.420
and the guy who they're trying to take the government back took the government

601
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.850
for the people when he was a student,

602
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:08.010
but then he got fat and happy and now he is like the dictator who doesn't want

603
00:36:08.011 --> 00:36:11.040
to let it go whenever you need,
whenever you taste the good life,

604
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.710
nobody wants to let it go.
Yeah.
You get the extra food,
you get the best booze.

605
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.560
I mean the best women.
Oh my God.
All of that and it's just like my silk robe.

606
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:24.620
Yeah.
People are cooking your meals.
He's sitting in a hot tub.
Yeah.

607
00:36:24.621 --> 00:36:29.070
You're going to get out of that thing to go help somebody less fortunate than

608
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:32.490
you.
No.
That's not how people are wired.
No.

609
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.230
They put up gates around their home and they say,
I'm going to keep this.
This is,

610
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.650
I'll read.
I'll read more about this stuff.
I,
I'll,
I'll definitely look up,

611
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.020
but you know why?
But,

612
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:47.130
but back to your thing about the orange guy pointing this out and bringing us

613
00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:50.880
into like,
I understand that's a big problem when you read about it.
It's like,

614
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.120
Ooh boy,
this is a mass.
Don't we have her own messages?
Like the aren't,
aren't,

615
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.040
aren't like why do I have to jump into this one?
I mean,
there's stuff like that.

616
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:03.900
No human being to human being yet you're supposed to care.
You do care.

617
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.460
But I can't,
how much time,

618
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.510
you know you could care about everything we get through the Nicaragua thing is a

619
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:11.430
huge thing.
I mean,
it's,
I don't even know it's gone there.

620
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.680
All I know is this country is fucking bankrupt.

621
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:19.370
And because we're fighting a war that has no set ending and you're not allowed

622
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:21.480
to ask about it.

623
00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.000
And I don't want to bring this shit up when you got a fucking show coming out.

624
00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.640
Um,
it's,
it's just one of those things where it's just like,

625
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.930
I don't understand why,
if I ask like,
hey,

626
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.570
how are we going to pay for this?
Hey,
when are we coming back?

627
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.900
All of a sudden I don't support the troops.
I'm not American.

628
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.920
And I just became like,
I just got my,
I'm,
I'm part of Isis now.
Yeah,

629
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.030
I can do that with us talking about it.
I love the Patriots.

630
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.250
I can sit there and be like,
what the fuck are we doing?

631
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.050
Why did we draft that guy?
People just go,

632
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:53.970
don't go like you're not a patriot fed you like the jets.
You're a piece of shit.

633
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.000
So it's a very weird,

634
00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.540
it's a weird time that you can't because there's a bunch of people afraid to say

635
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:03.450
stuff that we,
everybody kind of agrees with.
Yeah,

636
00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.710
but don't you think also that there's a lot of real like reasonable people that

637
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:10.320
are thinking the same thing you are on whatever issue,

638
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.290
thinking the same thing and when you do bring it up,

639
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.470
they agree and quietly go about their day.
Like normal people,

640
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:19.930
they come up after the show after they didn't laugh and say,
yeah,
I,

641
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.070
you're 100% right on the blah,
blah,
blah.
I totally agree with this.

642
00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:24.510
Or I had a dad just like that.

643
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.750
What are the fuck that you were talking about that made the crowd go quiet?
I,
I,

644
00:38:27.751 --> 00:38:28.584
you know what it really is.

645
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.950
I can't believe how many people are afraid to get in trouble.
Yeah.

646
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.490
Like basically get yelled at on Twitter.
Right.
By who?

647
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:41.050
By who is the loudest,
loudest one.
Right.
It's just,

648
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.340
that's what I'm saying.

649
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:46.540
There's so many more people that aren't tweeting hateful stuff at you.

650
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.480
I think most of it has to do with a corporation.

651
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:54.510
God forbid if one extra nickel that they could have made rolled out the fucking

652
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:58.120
door,
that's the only time they do the customer is always right,

653
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:01.420
is with that shit.
Right.
Everything else you can go fuck yourself.

654
00:39:01.421 --> 00:39:04.930
You can go to the website and stare at the screen and try and figure it out

655
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:07.960
yourself and maybe you'll get a portion of a refund or something.

656
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.410
I don't want to get all gloom and doom here with this stuff.
So let's,

657
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:13.600
let's talk sports,
man.
Um,

658
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.580
I was really watching the red sox and uh,
then I just a duty,

659
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:21.760
I have to tell you what,
like this is the regular season man.
I know,

660
00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:25.720
but it has been such a crew.
I'm a Yankee Fan.
Right.

661
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.040
And it has been set by the way.
Congratulations.
It's been,

662
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.040
must've been a fun ride your whole life.
It wasn't when I was a kid.

663
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.950
Well I had a little Greg nettles,

664
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.920
Reggie Jackson when I was really little and then I had to go the whole eighties

665
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.870
without as world series.

666
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.950
Do you realize if you guys don't win it this year or next year,

667
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:50.080
that is the only second time.
You haven't won a world series during a a decade.

668
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.090
Yeah.
Do you the level of success that that is fucking ridiculous.

669
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.400
Not to mention I think two decades.

670
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.110
You want at least half of them in the forties and 50s while yeah.

671
00:40:02.111 --> 00:40:04.720
But I mean I can't,
I know,
who knows what was going on back then.

672
00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.280
There was a Bobby socks and Frank Sinatra one during my time.
Right.

673
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.660
We went through horrible periods when they were like trying to buy people and we

674
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:18.220
never in and it was always messed up.
But the Jeter years,
homegrown kids.

675
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.470
Great cause you guy got the,

676
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.560
I got kicked out of baseball and he would have got rid of half of them.

677
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:26.770
I don't think Jeter and I don't think he would have known what you would agree

678
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:28.510
on a Rivera was going to be because nobody did.

679
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:30.640
Cause you guys had him pitch in like no,
but it'll relief.

680
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.820
Oh Neil would have been gone.
Bernie Williams would have been gone.

681
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.760
Well O'neil you got from the reds eat.
They wouldn't,

682
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:40.330
they would not have hung on to these people.
He was but it was homegrown.
It was,

683
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.580
it was pure.
I have a guilt.

684
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:47.610
I have guilt as a Yankee fan when you buy and you know you've got Johnny Damon

685
00:40:48.291 --> 00:40:50.530
and all of a sudden the,
and even the outfield.

686
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.140
I don't like that money part of it.

687
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.400
Oh we we we are going to write over the cliff with yeah.
No like I,

688
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.390
well they're in our division.
This is how you play.

689
00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:00.520
So now you guys are doing it the right way.

690
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.680
We're doing it the right way and it's been a great season.
I love baseball,
right.

691
00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.980
My favorite sport and I'm enjoying the hell out of us.

692
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.570
Young guys scraping,
enjoying it.

693
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:16.050
The second best record in all of baseball and we can get close to the red sox,

694
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.860
but this is what's great though.

695
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.940
What is so great is the greed of baseball.
We're now,

696
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:27.790
they have to have 9 million rounds.
Like back in the day,

697
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:31.180
if we slept swept you in August.
Yeah,
that would have been a big thing.

698
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.260
But back in the day I was would have been as a red sox fan.
Okay.

699
00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:35.240
How'd they going to fuck it up this time?
Cause they always did.

700
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.710
But that would immense something.
Yes.
That didn't really mean anything because,

701
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.510
because all our doesn't mean anything.
Yeah,

702
00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:44.750
because you guys are going to get the wildcard.
We'll get one game,

703
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:49.751
play off against a Oakland or something and we'll lose and be out in one game.

704
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.650
So first all,
why didn't,
you know,
I don't like the one.
What's the one game thing?

705
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.920
Well you have the one game,
the one game playoff.
Oh,

706
00:41:57.921 --> 00:41:59.190
so they added that and then this,

707
00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:03.250
the three game and then the forest and then the four,
right?
Yeah,

708
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.970
but guys doing up there white,
you never,
you never lose.
You never lose.

709
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.940
How many wins did they have?
Uh,
last I checked they were like 91 and 41 or,

710
00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.230
yeah,
we just got lucky in 41,
three.
So,
but no,
we were,
uh,
tonight.
I didn't know.

711
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.180
I didn't,
I didn't,
well,
I'm taping this Sunday night too,

712
00:42:19.181 --> 00:42:22.970
so don't confuse you guys as good.
Are you guys as good as uh,

713
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.390
as this record shit?
No,
no.
Nobody ever is.

714
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:29.720
Your regular season record is never as good as you are because you're,

715
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:32.450
you're rolling up all these stats on people who aren't going to be there in

716
00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:35.360
October.
Switch.
You have to do is you've got to look at like we just played,

717
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.080
we just played,
uh,

718
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.360
the Indians who I think Terry Francona is still the best managers in baseball.

719
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:42.530
Everybody sleeping on them.

720
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.660
Nobody gets more out of their place in this fucking guy.

721
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.700
And we played a four game series.

722
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:50.990
We split it the first two games he made us look like a 500 ball club and then

723
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:55.390
our big free agent guys,
you know,
sale and price came in and shut up down.
Right.

724
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.160
Okay.
Now here's the thing,

725
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:01.670
you fucking like Houston,
they got for Atlanta,

726
00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:04.460
they got all those get dented offending world series champion.

727
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.950
Nobody's talking about it.
They're so good.
Exactly.

728
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.730
And they probably had a couple of injuries and whatever,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

729
00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:13.190
blah.
All I know is come October,
we're all zero and zero.

730
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.400
I think clearly there might pick to,
to take it again.

731
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:21.430
And what ESPN does about regulus seasons is what the news does about like Isis

732
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.980
where in my head,
isis was powerful enough to come over here,

733
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.540
attack this country and overthrow it.
Right.
Until I actually sat down,
I was like,

734
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:35.930
they don't have a plane or a boat or uniforms.
Right?

735
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:41.180
This is not Germany and Japan again.
Okay.
So,
uh,
there's fucking,

736
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:44.360
um,
they do the same thing with,

737
00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.460
they basically said the race was over when we swept you guys four games in a

738
00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:53.660
fucking rock knowing do we have like 12 games left?
Yeah.

739
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.400
Injuries happening to try and get to the one on the 18th or 19th.
So I've,
dude,

740
00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:00.940
I've done this too many times,

741
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:05.770
is a sports fan to know to try to put my seat up in August.
I know.

742
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.350
Say anything's over.
I watched his flow a 12 game lead.

743
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:13.010
Like I dunno how many years ago,
four or five years ago.
I watched this blow,

744
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:16.600
that classic 18 game lead and 78.
Yeah,
I've,

745
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.780
I've seen the Tok role.
I've seen the,
the fucking,
uh,

746
00:44:20.781 --> 00:44:23.780
I've seen it all through this fat and roughing the passer.

747
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.930
There's still that insecure.
I've been beaten by my,

748
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.800
I've seen of Dalles roll through guys legs and so great.

749
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:36.030
I was at dinner with my brother in law and his wife the other night and a red

750
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:40.200
sox fans.
And there's literally,
when we were talking,

751
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:43.380
we were still nine and a half up.
But yeah,
it was the Cleveland.

752
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.010
And they lost the first game in Cleveland and the Yankees won that night and we

753
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:51.480
got a half game up and I was like,
here it comes.
Here comes the slide.

754
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:53.610
This is the beginning of it again.

755
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.480
And I was just talking out of my ass because they're so solid.

756
00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.860
But the fear in my brother-in-law's eyes like,
oh man,
it really is.

757
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:05.070
This is the beginning of,
because he's gone through it like passing.

758
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.340
You get millennials.
They'd be like,
yeah,
fuck you.
We got this Yankee stuck.

759
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:11.130
They don't even,
they don't know.
No,
they don't.
Oh No.

760
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.850
I went to Fenway for the first time this year in the beginning of the season.

761
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.810
Horrible,
rainy night.
But,
uh,
that was my first time there.

762
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.320
I've watched so many games at Fenway on TV.

763
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.100
It was so surreal.
I felt like I had been there before.
Oh yeah.

764
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:27.540
When you're sitting in the thing,

765
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.520
like when you're walking through and trying to get food.

766
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:32.580
And so when I go back now,
it's not the ballpark I went to as a kid.

767
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.130
I mean they got like a mall in the right field and got people sitting up on the

768
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:38.660
green monster.
It is so different for when,
when I left the Green Moss would,

769
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.420
it didn't have any advertising,
anything.

770
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.440
I think it looks way better with the advertising and,

771
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.010
and early in Ted Williams days or pre Ted Williams,
dom dimaggio days,

772
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:49.020
it's something I believe they had advertising there.

773
00:45:49.021 --> 00:45:52.290
So it's gone through like a bunch of stuff.
But uh,
dude,

774
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:54.660
I was just thinking all this shit that I've seen,
I've seen the Celtics,

775
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:59.250
any game seven with the Lakers had seen the refs call 30 something files on them

776
00:45:59.251 --> 00:46:01.410
and like 15 on the Lakers in a game.
Seven.

777
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.730
I literally watched the Lakers beat us from the foul line and they ate.

778
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:05.610
These weren't,
we wasn't,

779
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.590
we were out there hacking people who so fucking anticlimactic.
Um,

780
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.670
Rudel I've seen too many men on the ice.
I,
I've,

781
00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.170
I,
I've too many.
Like,
I don't give a fuck how many games were up until,

782
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.750
but they also had this taken out of your ball and you'll have the little snow

783
00:46:22.751 --> 00:46:26.980
plow to give a thing for the guy shakes.
Every team has had those things.
All,

784
00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:31.410
all of that shit.
Yeah,
that too.
I have to tell you that deflate gate

785
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:37.050
is up there with any like as far as like the music man,

786
00:46:37.051 --> 00:46:41.760
you could redo the music man with the flaky if they like the study literally

787
00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:46.350
found that like the cults also had like three balls that were slightly

788
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.520
underinflated ESPN did a study or it's of course that showed that the ball

789
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:52.710
actually got there a little bit later.
So it'd be an advantage.

790
00:46:52.711 --> 00:46:53.610
Does affect defense.

791
00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:57.510
So of course they pulled that immediately and a bunch of pats fans had recorded

792
00:46:57.511 --> 00:47:00.780
it going like what?
They don't want you to know.
Right.
So why?

793
00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:05.400
So why Wa looking back now I feel like what was it they don't do?

794
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:07.770
They did something they fucking,

795
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.570
cause we were in with with good Dell and then something happened and then we

796
00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:15.200
would just fucking out.
I think part of it was,

797
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.900
well I think part of it was when they under suspended ray rice.
Uh,

798
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.660
and they would just like,
yeah,

799
00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:24.690
a couple of games and then they tried to say that they didn't see it.

800
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.230
Then you found out they sought and then Goodell,
he's making like 35,

801
00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:32.100
$36 million a year.
Um,
then I think he,
he,

802
00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.660
he just started over suspending everybody.

803
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:38.830
And do you think it's like if we go after the golden boy that'll kind of take

804
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:43.000
the heat off of the whole league?
No.
What I think what ended up happening,

805
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:44.800
I think we,
the combination was that,

806
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:47.290
and then we had some sort of falling out with the guy and then we took them to

807
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:49.240
court and in a court of law,

808
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:53.920
I mean it got laughed out of court that judge actually yelled at the NFL for

809
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:57.670
wasting their time.
Really?
So a lot of people forget that.

810
00:47:57.671 --> 00:48:02.010
So then he played the next year and not suspended.
So then what,
you know,
now,

811
00:48:02.011 --> 00:48:04.600
he can't have double jeopardy.
You can't get tried for the same thing.

812
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:09.310
So the NFL went back and changed their argument and said,
and said,

813
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.240
is the NFL a corporation?
And they said yes.
And they says,

814
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:17.890
does a corporation have a right to suspend an employee?

815
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:23.410
And they,
and they,
if they feel fit.
And they said yes.
And they said,
well,

816
00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:28.120
Tom Brady is an employee of our corporation and he is,
he is suspended.

817
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:32.970
And they couldn't mess with that.
So that's what we got.
That's he just,

818
00:48:32.971 --> 00:48:37.971
so he sat down for four games because if Tom Brady and the Patriots took the NFL

819
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:42.010
to court and won and reversed it,

820
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.610
that was going to open the flood gates every time helmet to helmet head and

821
00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:49.240
suspension,
all this could potentially,
you know,
a corporation thinks like,

822
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:53.020
oh my God,
the amount of money in legal costs,
we'll have the nuts running them,

823
00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:56.590
the not house they had to fucking suspend them.
Right.

824
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.120
So that is my totally biased patriots.
Yeah.
You know,

825
00:49:01.121 --> 00:49:05.140
as far as like I'll be taking air out of the ball.
We tried to steal signs.
Yes.

826
00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:09.730
As is everybody else.
Which is why when you watch a college football game,

827
00:49:09.731 --> 00:49:12.250
my favorite thing ever,
when you watched them,
when they send into signals,

828
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.170
there's like four guys doing it right.

829
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.870
If somebody is holding up a picture of Urkel that guys,
you know,

830
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.170
fucking pop lockin you know,

831
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:23.830
and I also love to like that whole idea that if you film somebody,

832
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:24.820
you know what they're doing,

833
00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:28.660
like they're miming throwing the ball or handing it off or punting it.

834
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.620
You still have to figure it out.
And,
and as much as we weren't guilty with the,

835
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.650
uh,
of,
of the spy gate thing,
I mean,
if you're going to sit there and say,
oh yeah,

836
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.350
first of all,
everyone else's pure,
well the thing about that is,

837
00:49:41.351 --> 00:49:43.900
is that was the first game that that was illegal to do that.

838
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.980
What do you mean that was enough?
Well,
that that was legal.
You are allowed to,

839
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.860
Jimmy Johnson even said,
he goes,
I came in the league,
they say,
okay,
what do I do?

840
00:49:50.861 --> 00:49:55.040
He,
you get a camera pointed at their guy looking at it at halftime,

841
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.550
whatever you can steal,
steal.
Oh really?

842
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:00.130
So I think it just looked bad after a while.

843
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:03.700
So the rule was to just that you couldn't have a guy on the field,

844
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.630
you could still have a guy up in the booth that is something called a Zoom Lens.

845
00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:12.490
Right.
It's still doing it.
Everybody is still fucking doing it.
So it's funny.

846
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.260
Yeah.
So if you're going to spend any money,

847
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:15.530
you're going to say steal and science,

848
00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:18.730
then we should have to forfeit world war two.

849
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:24.850
Do you have a college team that you like or you're like,
yes,
yes.

850
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.610
I have a bunch of that I like,
but Lsu is my adopted one.
That's your adopted,

851
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.660
I just loved the a sec.
Uh,
this was 10 years ago,
about 2008.

852
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:37.720
I was after a Nick Saban was there and I was into a less miles and you know,

853
00:50:38.631 --> 00:50:41.450
he would keep it to stew,
that ship,
you know,
it was almost like he was,

854
00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:46.280
his offensive mind was where the people in the upper deck was where they like go

855
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:50.300
far
and he would just do it.
Yeah.

856
00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.150
And it worked for a little while.
The LSU,
they're big.

857
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:56.900
They're big thing is they've never,
they,
and since I've been watching them,

858
00:50:56.901 --> 00:51:01.610
they haven't had a quarterback that they've believed in enough to let him play

859
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:02.421
the full game.

860
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:07.421
And they are literally playing a lot of times the stereotypical like old school

861
00:51:07.841 --> 00:51:10.550
stereotypical white quarterback,

862
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.670
a black quarterback thing where it's like it's a passing down.

863
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:17.030
You'll get the white guy in there.
Right.
So running the,

864
00:51:17.031 --> 00:51:18.530
we could maybe run the option here,

865
00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:22.840
get the black guy in there and it's just like,
that's hilarious.

866
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:27.060
Hit One and just go and let them get into the,
the,
the,

867
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:31.970
the feel of the game as it'd be like,
Hey Tom,
I never liked hosting.

868
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.770
Yeah.
Cause it's like you get them going,

869
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.230
you get him going and then you've got to bring somebody up at such an art and

870
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:38.000
then you sit down,
you fucking,
you know,

871
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.190
thinking about your day the next day and it's like,
oh fuck,

872
00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:42.880
I got to run back up and do another five minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

873
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.170
my favorite thing and hosting was we're going to,
yeah,

874
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:47.720
we're going to keep the show moving right along and bring the next guy up.

875
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.520
I always,
my favorite thing with hosting,

876
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.550
I'm not going to do anytime it was between are we going to keep this so much

877
00:51:53.551 --> 00:51:56.960
just murders or it's going to keep the show going.
I kind of,

878
00:51:56.961 --> 00:52:00.620
I really like how the comedy store doesn't have a host.

879
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.670
I really like,
yeah.
How did they just bring everybody up?

880
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:08.090
You just bring each other on?
I didn't,
I didn't think I was going to like that.

881
00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:10.210
It's,
it's pretty awesome.
Oh,

882
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.320
you want to talk about a place that just turned around?
I don't know if you ever,

883
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:17.390
I was living out here in the late nineties and when you went down to the comedy

884
00:52:17.391 --> 00:52:20.870
store,
I mean also no one knew who I was.
I was struggling to get spots,

885
00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:25.550
but that place,
first of all there was nobody there.
Now it's spooky.
Yeah.

886
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:28.790
And it was like,
oh to the vibe hype.

887
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.880
Like it was like,
it was like a fucking haunted house.

888
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:34.220
Like you went in there and there was all of these guys,

889
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.630
these guys that were on TV and they were big names and they would come in and

890
00:52:38.631 --> 00:52:42.270
just burn the light.
They would just stand there.
Yeah,

891
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.880
having not done the work now,
didn't write anything new.

892
00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.590
We're just standing there leaning against the Mike saying,
yeah,

893
00:52:48.591 --> 00:52:50.960
so what else is going on?
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

894
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:54.710
And you're sitting back there,
you know your spots pushed back.
Five minutes,

895
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:57.860
10 minutes,
40 minutes,
an hour and a half,
two hours.
I'm going home.

896
00:52:57.861 --> 00:53:01.760
I can't go home if I go home.
They don't know me.
So I,
I,
you just have to,

897
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:04.480
would have to fucking stay there.
Gruden and um,

898
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:08.480
and all these young kids were learning Sunday when I get on his show,

899
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:11.420
I'm going to do that.
All right.
And I,
and I remember

900
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.100
being here in 98,

901
00:53:14.101 --> 00:53:19.101
and it was right as Seinfeld was wrapping up in Jerry the first time ever.

902
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:23.330
All these years I'd been out there and he popped in at the Improv and I was
like,

903
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:27.690
Holy Shit.
Right.
It's the king.
Right.
And he went on stage,

904
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:31.380
was supposed to do 15 minutes.
He did 15 minutes,
right.

905
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:34.650
He started with the killer Joe.
He ended with a great job.

906
00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:37.950
Even better joke in the middle.
He tried out as new stuff and I just,

907
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.940
I just clicked.
I was like,
that's the way you do it.
That's a fucking pro.

908
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.960
And that other shit is just ego and oh,
that's all it is.
I got to show,

909
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.300
oh yeah,
yeah,
no,
that place was spooked.
I remember going there,

910
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:56.160
the store back then and it was like,
this is not going to help me.

911
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:58.590
I'm like,
this is going to make me depressed.
It was,
it was,

912
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:03.330
it was fucking hostile.
It was really was.
It was hostile.
And I remember,
uh,

913
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.600
there was a couple rays of light over there.
Rogan.

914
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:10.430
I remember meeting Rogan for the first time at the laugh factory and I wrote

915
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.130
over yet,
of course he had this fucking bad ass,
cool car currying words that I,

916
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:18.760
that's really what I remember about those days was just watching Joe come in and

917
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:22.550
really cool car.
I'm like,
wow,
that guy's really got it going on.
Yeah,
he did.
Yeah.

918
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.190
Some sick ass tail fin.
There was some sort of Japanese sports car,

919
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.203
I can't remember.

920
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:32.510
So some turbo powered something and we went over there and this and he basically

921
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:38.500
gave me like a pep talk.
Oh yeah.
On the mindset you hit it wasn't,

922
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.480
wasn't specifically pointed at the comedy store.

923
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:47.040
It was just the La comedy scene.
Right,
right.
Like how you had to be,

924
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.200
don't fucking listen to anybody,
get in there,
do your job.
And just like,

925
00:54:52.201 --> 00:54:52.951
it was like a real,

926
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:57.951
like it was like a eight point power Joe Rogan PowerPoint thing that's great on

927
00:54:58.801 --> 00:55:02.730
the mindset and that looked like,
and he was like a,
he was young.
Yeah.
Joe.

928
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:04.890
So he was like,
yeah.
It was like,

929
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:07.710
is this guy going to like help me a fucking rip my head off?
Like,

930
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:12.210
he was like the most amped up dude I'd ever fucking been around.
Uh,

931
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:16.050
and uh,
fortunately he turned out to be like just a sweetheart of a guy.
Yeah.

932
00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:20.010
And really the kind of the heart of what turned that place around.
Like,

933
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.370
I'll do him calling out fucking medicine and all that.
Like,
dude,
I was like,

934
00:55:23.371 --> 00:55:24.610
it was,
it was fucking ridiculous.

935
00:55:24.611 --> 00:55:26.520
I was like coming in there with a big can of raid,

936
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.180
just spraying it on cross the whole comedy store.

937
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:34.720
It was unbelievable because like the,
the terror that you had yeah.
You believe,

938
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.550
yeah,
he pulled in,
he pulled in the thing and you're like,
fuck,
I'm going on next.

939
00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.070
Right.
And all the work you wanted to do,
you could not do.
You put,
not fucking do,

940
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:46.470
I mean I want to start that shit up again,
but like it's amazing now.

941
00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:48.450
I mean when you walk in there now it just,

942
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:52.980
just the original room just to go and have a place to really work.

943
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.470
Like you really are going to get work done.
Yeah.

944
00:55:55.471 --> 00:55:58.290
And what's funny is looking at rogue and look how big Rogan is and what does he

945
00:55:58.291 --> 00:56:01.050
do?
He does it like Seinfeld you 15 he goes up,

946
00:56:01.051 --> 00:56:04.890
he does 15 tries out the shit he wants to try out.
He kills,
you know,

947
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.860
so work on your stuff and go.
But it's amazing though,

948
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:12.570
that usually wants a place or a scene goes bad like that.

949
00:56:12.571 --> 00:56:15.710
It's very rare that it comes.
Yeah.

950
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.070
It's like a movie in a movie that happens.
I know,
but Juno's triumphs over evil.

951
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:21.270
Yeah.

952
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:25.820
But similar to what you were saying about seller being like that special room

953
00:56:25.821 --> 00:56:27.350
and something just happens there.

954
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:32.390
Places have something to them.
Yep.

955
00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:35.090
The laugh factory is always going to be the laugh factory.

956
00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.430
The sellers always going to be the seller.
You know what I mean?
Like you,

957
00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.210
it was unreal,
man.
You may dip and have bad times,

958
00:56:41.211 --> 00:56:43.990
but that room is begging to be good again.
Yeah.

959
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:47.120
You know the one that I remember way back in the day,
uh,

960
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:48.680
in the 90s when we were coming up,

961
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.360
if you on the nine o'clock show Saturday night at the comic Strip,
Oh my God,

962
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.711
I made,
it was so,

963
00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:59.180
it was like you'd come off and think you the greatest comedian of all time.
Yes.

964
00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:00.710
I'm ready to do Letterman.
Yes.

965
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:04.730
That room energy of that square room,

966
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.320
that centered stage.
Yeah.
It was unreal.
Yup.

967
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.820
On that one and that route.
And that's a club that's,

968
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:16.250
that's gone in the toilet and it's just waiting to come back.

969
00:57:16.251 --> 00:57:20.150
You put the right person booking it and start attracting the good guys back

970
00:57:20.151 --> 00:57:24.710
again.
Cause that room,
the architecture,
the energy,

971
00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:29.180
when human beings are in it,
it's waiting to be great.
I was still in New York,

972
00:57:29.181 --> 00:57:32.420
I would still go there even if it's going through a bad period.

973
00:57:32.421 --> 00:57:36.080
It's just like just to keep it going.
Yeah.
Then you got to use,

974
00:57:36.081 --> 00:57:39.380
we use whatever juice you have to keep cause how does that help comics?

975
00:57:39.381 --> 00:57:42.140
If there's one less room,
forget about a room like that.
What you do that,

976
00:57:42.141 --> 00:57:46.820
that room was fucking crazy,
crazy,
crazy.
Do you remember when,
uh,

977
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:51.020
what would the,
where the names,
the team red Johnny and the round guy.

978
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:54.590
Oh God.
When they would go up at the comic strip,

979
00:57:55.130 --> 00:58:00.080
I mean to follow him at the fucking Boston Comedy Club.
Nothing was bigger.

980
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:05.170
Nothing was bigger that they would just rip the roof off that place.

981
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:08.540
I mean to don't like when they,

982
00:58:08.541 --> 00:58:12.110
when they used to be down to the fucking Boston to comedy club and they,

983
00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:15.380
and they would do the fucking [inaudible].
It takes two,

984
00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:19.690
it takes two to make it
and one of them is gone.

985
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.460
And then remember Matt Frost,
who's down ca,

986
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:26.980
he would be flicking the lights bucking on and off like it was a nightclub and

987
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:30.340
the place would be going nuts.
They was some,

988
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.440
it was some joke that they did about going to a dance club and feeling like an

989
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:39.190
asshole.
And they just like,
when they went into that bit,

990
00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.680
it was like you were at a fuck.
It's like you started watching a movie.
Yeah.

991
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:47.320
And you'd be shocked.
I remember just standing there going like,
I have nothing,

992
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.930
nothing,
nothing in my arsenal in my whole career.
Never.

993
00:58:51.931 --> 00:58:53.590
You could take all of it and slam it together.

994
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:56.800
I have nothing that could follow that.
And I,
oh my God.

995
00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:01.330
And going up in that fucking room after those guys and bombing,

996
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:05.990
it was the loneliest fucking thing.
Like,
I mean I,

997
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:09.980
if I ever saw comics start crying and that I wouldn't even judge them because

998
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.210
that was back to when the club where all the comics sat in the backpack.

999
00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.410
But you had to walk to the front of the stage and go up in the middle before

1000
00:59:17.411 --> 00:59:20.800
they had that side.
Yes.
And they would just be back there.
And I remember I was,

1001
00:59:20.801 --> 00:59:24.040
this kid came down from Boston,
nobody gave a fuck.

1002
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.660
I remember running to Todd Barry calling like going like,
ah,
how do I get in it?

1003
00:59:28.661 --> 00:59:31.090
Like asking you that fucking question where there is no answer,

1004
00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:35.050
how do I get in at the clubs?
He's like,
yeah,
I dunno man.

1005
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.733
<v 2>Just keep doing it.</v>

1006
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:41.710
<v 0>You know,
just,
you got to hang out and it,</v>

1007
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.470
and I know and I now I know what he was thinking like,
hey dude,
I'm trying,

1008
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:46.620
I'm still trying to get it,
you know,

1009
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.150
and you'd sit back there and you'd watch like a towel and Kevin,
Brandon,

1010
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:52.370
all these guys that were like already made men.

1011
00:59:52.371 --> 00:59:56.810
Like in the end everybody had an edge and there was no like joy of like,

1012
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:59.000
come on along,
I'll show you the way.

1013
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:04.450
It was just mean tough guys who got a spot and you weren't taking it from them

1014
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:08.960
and screw you to get the member to stay til two o'clock in the morning and let

1015
01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:11.690
me,
I dare you to complain.
Yeah,
I dare you.

1016
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.840
And there was a bunch of comics he used to hide uptown because they didn't want

1017
01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:16.570
to go downtown.
It gets their feet,

1018
01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:20.990
they went down there once it takes two to make it.
Thank you already fuck that.

1019
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:26.770
I am not going below fucking 23rd street and they were scary up there was scary

1020
01:00:26.931 --> 01:00:28.670
down there.
It was a,

1021
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:33.170
it was like Armageddon and I used to walk by the Boston during the day when it

1022
01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:35.990
had that shit.
Read awning that look turn pink.

1023
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.620
It looks like an old peep show bill it fucking front.
I used to,

1024
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:43.250
I used to get sick to my stomach when I would look at it and I,
and I did.

1025
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:45.800
That was the main dread where I was just like,

1026
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.100
I have to get over this fucking feeling or I am not going to make it in this

1027
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:51.350
city.
I know cause that is fucking not,

1028
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.550
I'm just walking by the building and it's like that bully I have to fight.
Yes.

1029
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.430
Completely.
I remember saying to Kevin Brennan,

1030
01:00:58.431 --> 01:01:02.360
we were up at the standup New York and uh,
he's like,

1031
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:05.180
was talking just about this and I said yeah,
but you know,

1032
01:01:05.181 --> 01:01:07.340
we got to keep going cause it's making a stronger,
right.

1033
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:11.960
We gotta go cause make her stronger.
Everyone goes,
it's comedy.

1034
01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:14.120
I mean how fucking strong do we have to be?

1035
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:16.283
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1036
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.200
<v 0>I remember this comic to bitch and say that they should,</v>

1037
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:22.350
this should be no heckling.
There should be no heckling.
He's like,

1038
01:01:22.351 --> 01:01:25.260
he'd go to a Broadway show,
there's no heckling and I don't want to be like,

1039
01:01:25.261 --> 01:01:26.400
well fucking go,

1040
01:01:26.401 --> 01:01:30.270
go fucking get a job on Broadway then Duke because I don't think that there

1041
01:01:30.271 --> 01:01:31.560
should be any heckling that's like,

1042
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.500
I think that's what makes stand up so fucking cool.
Is that,
yeah,

1043
01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:39.150
that is actually,
you know,
that's part of it that somebody is going to do that.

1044
01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:43.800
Yeah.
There's the energy that something's good that this is going to be different

1045
01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:46.770
tonight than it was last night.
And I would maybe because of me,

1046
01:01:46.771 --> 01:01:49.440
it might be cause the audience maybe because of the Moon,
who knows?

1047
01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:53.400
And the fact that some people heckle is also what keeps a lot of people from

1048
01:01:53.401 --> 01:01:58.280
never,
it weeds out a lot of people.
Yeah.
Which is a gun on both sides.
Yeah.

1049
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.810
I don't want to keep you here too long.
I know you're,

1050
01:02:00.811 --> 01:02:05.700
you're onto a bunch of other podcasts to promote your show.
I stay here all day.

1051
01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:09.720
We'll also,
we want to have enough time for good.
Frick cigar maybe.
Who knows?

1052
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.110
We'll start one.
Finish it at home.
Yeah,
you could do that.
All right,

1053
01:02:13.111 --> 01:02:16.650
let's do that.
Let's do that.

Oh,

1060
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:40.560
that's awesome.
Yeah,
that's great.
All right.

1061
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.140
I've already pitched myself for the second season.
I can't do it.

1062
01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:46.020
So happy for you success,
buddy.
Thank you buddy.
All right,
sue the best.

1063
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:50.730
<v 1>Right?
Okay.
Now it's time for the reeds here.</v>

1064
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.760
I apologize to all the people that wrote in above the farmers down there and,

1065
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.650
uh,
South Africa.

1066
01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:02.910
I'm going to read up on that and I will read the rest of that guy's email.
Um,

1067
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:09.030
um,
on Thursday.
Okay.
That's my promise.
Now,
if you know me,

1068
01:03:09.031 --> 01:03:13.200
I'm scatterbrained,
so I might forget.
Okay.
But,
uh,

1069
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:17.070
I don't take innocent people dying anywhere lately.

1070
01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:19.620
It had nothing to do with that has to do with the other bullshit.
All right,

1071
01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:24.600
with that,
let's,
uh,
do some reads here.
Oh,
men mobile.
Oh,

1072
01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:28.440
what do you get gum when you fucking,
she'll have you kissed,
ticked.
Um,

1073
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.690
mint mobile.
Uh,
the big in big wireless providers stands for a lot of things,

1074
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:38.820
big contracts,
big bill's big phase,
big pain in the fork in HD.

1075
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:44.130
What big wireless doesn't want you to know is that there's a way to cut your

1076
01:03:44.131 --> 01:03:48.810
wireless bill down to just 15 bucks a month.
No Way,
man.

1077
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.520
How was that possible?
Introducing meant mobile,

1078
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:58.910
the game changing company that takes everything into what that's taken.

1079
01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:02.460
Everything.
Oh,
sorry.

1080
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:05.810
Wrong with big wireless and made it right there.

1081
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:10.410
Crusaders meant mobile makes it so easy to cut your wireless bill down to just

1082
01:04:10.411 --> 01:04:14.520
15 bucks a month.
Use Your own phone with any mint mobile plan.

1083
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.840
Okay.
These guys aren't like separate but equal.

1084
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:24.540
Then I go and uh,
down the south here in the 1960s and fifties.

1085
01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.060
Um,
they're user friendly here.

1086
01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:30.360
You can use your own phone with any mid mobile plan.

1087
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:34.530
You can keep your old number along with all your existing contacts.

1088
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:39.090
Choose between two,
five,
or 10 gigabyte,
four g LTE plans.

1089
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.400
Every plan comes with unlimited talk and text.
Jesus Christ.

1090
01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:46.830
I'm going to get this unlimited talk and text.

1091
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:51.150
And if you're not 100% satisfaction satisfied mint mobile has you covered with

1092
01:04:51.151 --> 01:04:53.430
their seven day money back guarantee?

1093
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.720
Well when does the fucking bill camp comes once a month?

1094
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.150
How does that work?

1095
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:03.000

how great this Conor McGregor look at every way or whatever,

1172

You could do it too.

1175
01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:03.921
Here's how it works.

1176
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:08.240

1177
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.190

submit your measurements way for your custom suit to arrive in just a few weeks.

1179

And then you've got a custom suit.

1180
01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.810
So if you show up where everybody else has a suit on,

1181
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:21.140
they just bought it off the rack.
They don't got their initials there,

1182
01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.260
then I've got that snazzy lining that you're going to have.
Right.

1183
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.260
Visit a showroom or shop online@indochino.com uh,

It didn't rhyme.
Whatever.
I thought it was pretty good on the fly.

1203
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:43.200
You know the fun,

1206
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:54.171
hunting around for the perfect pair at a crowded store and eventually settling

1207
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:55.291
for good enough.

1208
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:59.610

1209
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:03.500

1211
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.290
which always reminds me of that Louis Ck joke when he was talking about calling

1212
01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:14.790
up a phone,
sex line and you know,

What they sustainably sourced material from beechwood trees.

1216
01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.230
This is our confident these guys are,

1217
01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:31.650
they're putting trees in their underwear and somehow it's still more comfortable

1218
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.903
than cotton.

1219
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:37.730
This naturally soft fiber makes a fabric that won't sag down or to rip.

Moon.

1239
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.600
Multiple job sites.
Stacks of resumes,

1240
01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:56.370
a confusing review process.
Jesus Christ.
Where does it end?

I use stamps.com to send out all my posters,

1285
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.830
which I really need to advertise better.
I have autographed posters,

1286
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:55.400
these amazing posters that people have told me I could sell for 40 bucks at a

1287
01:16:55.401 --> 01:16:58.880
show.
But you know what,
I'm a man of the people.
All right?

1288
01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:00.170
I only sell them for 20 bucks.

1289
01:17:00.171 --> 01:17:03.860
Their autograph to write every one of my God damn shows and people keep walking

1290
01:17:03.861 --> 01:17:07.390
out and then they texted me after,
hey man,
I wanted to see the poster.

1291
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:12.260
Where is it?
It's out there in the lobby.
I don't know where.
All right,

1292
01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:15.300
I'm sidetracked,

1298
01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.910
Alright.
By the way,
as I mentioned before,

1299
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:42.970
my great Buddy Dean del Ray's doing his first talk show as a standup comedian,

1300
01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.770
uh,
uh,
tonight,

1301
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:51.020
Monday night on Conan O'brien with the great and brilliant Mark Marin is one of

1302
01:17:51.021 --> 01:17:56.000
the guests.
Um,
please tune in and uh,

1303
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.210
and check it out.
And after that it says they got a ton of males,

1304
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:04.220
tiny emails about,
uh,
from South Africa.
So I have to read these.

1305
01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:08.450
I can at least read the rest of this guy.
Um,
his thing here,

1306
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.110
I forget where I left off.
Let,
let's just pick this up,

1307
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:16.850
which brings me to my second point.
Now I don't follow all the news on Trump.

1308
01:18:16.851 --> 01:18:20.840
Frankly,
I don't care anymore because it's exhausting.
I agree.
I agree too.

1309
01:18:20.841 --> 01:18:22.130
Everybody's screaming and yelling,

1310
01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:25.390
flipping the fuck out and nobody has a solution.
Uh,

1311
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.800
but the message I get from the media is still the same.

1312
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:31.940
They hate him and we'll blow up any small thing just to take them down.

1313
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:35.900
And basically,
you know,
something that is a problem in this country.

1314
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.670
Ever since Bill Clinton,

1315
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:42.320
no one has been allowed to be president without being constantly under attack.

1316
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.700
And I really think it hurts to position Democrat,
Republican,

1317
01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.390
or Libertarian,
whatever you,

1318
01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:52.400
you got to let the person tried to do the fucking job,
you know.
Anyways,

1319
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:54.170
they hate him and we'll blow up anything that he'd done.
Hey,

1320
01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:58.190
basically they are saying Trump has chosen debate,
team Ei,

1321
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:02.480
therefore we will choose opposing team.
Be A,

1322
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:05.510
that is true with CNN and Fox.
They both do it.

1323
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.540
Everybody's making a big deal over every bombshell in quotes,

1324
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:11.421
uh,

1325
01:19:11.421 --> 01:19:16.421
in the Mueller probe of he must have known and this lawyer knew about that shit

1326
01:19:17.181 --> 01:19:18.710
and pleaded guilty.
Really?

1327
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:22.220
Do you want to tell me Hillary Clinton or any other politician would have the

1328
01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:23.720
same kind of,
uh,

1329
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:25.880
at that you've wanted to say wouldn't have the same kind of deal?
Yeah.

1330
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:28.070
Hillary would have been getting attack the entire fucking time.

1331
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:32.990
They all played dirty.
I would never have expected it otherwise.
So my point is,

1332
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:38.450
yeah,
but they don't all play dirty.
Bernie Sanders did not play dirty,
which why?

1333
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:42.290
I don't think it's a waste of a vote to even know the guy's not going to win to

1334
01:19:42.291 --> 01:19:43.590
a vote for somebody like that,

1335
01:19:43.591 --> 01:19:46.910
because you're trying to encourage more people by seeing the amount of votes

1336
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.160
that you can get by being a good fucking person.

1337
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:54.200
I people say you wasted your vote anyways.
Um,

1338
01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.101
so my point is,

1339
01:19:55.101 --> 01:19:58.910
Trump actually noticed a problem in South Africa that requires attention,

1340
01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.500
but we probably won't get the attention we need because the dumb ass media is

1341
01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:08.180
too busy writing South Africa hit back at Trump articles.
Uh,

1342
01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:10.660
that's true.
They try to take down everything that he's doing.

1343
01:20:10.661 --> 01:20:12.010
But the thing about it is,

1344
01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:18.070
is he only seems to notice the problems that hit white people.
Okay.

1345
01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:20.590
That's the fucking problem.
Okay.
And,
and,

1346
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:25.750
and as much as our media definitely would have attacked any republican that went

1347
01:20:25.901 --> 01:20:29.590
in there,
the,
the left wing media would definitely do that.
I mean,

1348
01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:33.430
I think when you look at Neo Nazis and go,
yeah,
well,
I mean,

1349
01:20:33.431 --> 01:20:37.060
did you know people were being aggressive on both sides.

1350
01:20:37.061 --> 01:20:40.990
You kind of lose a lot of credibility is all I'm saying.
All right.

1351
01:20:40.991 --> 01:20:44.530
But I understand also what you're saying.
Okay.
Continuing.

1352
01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:49.750
Um,
wow.
You read it all the way up to here.
Thanks.

1353
01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:53.200
Go be an inspiration to all the other hairless ginger's out there.

1354
01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.950
MMM.
All right,
so there's another one from South Africa.

1355
01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.180
Bill Clinton's balanced budget myth.
All right,

1356
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:10.200
so it wasn't balanced.
Now I have to one,
like where did this come from?

1357
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:14.790
Now is this people on the right?
Yeah.
You don't know where any of this is from.

1358
01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.850
Okay,
so now I have to,

1359
01:21:16.851 --> 01:21:20.390
I'm just supposed to read this and I'm supposed to look at you and assume that

1360
01:21:20.391 --> 01:21:24.350
you're a this guy down the middle.
That votes on both sides.
I will,

1361
01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.350
I will read this.
You guys are making me more informed,
I think.

1362
01:21:27.351 --> 01:21:30.290
Or maybe you're swaying me like that guy who wrote in from Russia,

1363
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:33.320
but I don't know if that's the guy from Russia who's hacked into the Twitter

1364
01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:37.400
shit.
I don't know where any of this shit's coming from.
A shark theft.
Hey,

1365
01:21:37.401 --> 01:21:41.030
bill just wanted to share this ridiculous story about this guy that stole a

1366
01:21:41.031 --> 01:21:43.370
fucking sharp from an aquarium in Texas.

1367
01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:48.670
He dressed the shark is a baby and put it on a pushchair and just walked out.

1368
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:52.430
His justification was,
he was concerned for the sharks welfare.

1369
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.090
Well,
he probably wanted to put it back in the ocean,
but,
uh,

1370
01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.120
once he takes it out of the water,
I think the shark was like,
hey man,

1371
01:21:59.121 --> 01:22:03.500
I don't think that a query was,
was so bad.
Granted,
it's not as big as the ocean,

1372
01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:08.420
and I'm no longer to live freely as a living thing on this planet.
But,

1373
01:22:08.421 --> 01:22:10.410
uh,
you know,

1374
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:16.160
if the shark went to rescue you and stuck you dressed you was a baby and puts

1375
01:22:16.161 --> 01:22:20.570
you in a fucking carriage and then took you under water,

1376
01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.950
I think you'd be like,
Whoa,

1377
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:27.343
<v 2>okay.</v>

1378
01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.070
<v 1>Oh,
there is still some due process in this country.</v>

1379
01:22:30.071 --> 01:22:34.660
The fact that the article says a man man accused of stealing shark,
I mean,

1380
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:39.060
I think the fact that he had it,
you know,
oh,

1381
01:22:39.061 --> 01:22:40.140
I thought this was like,

1382
01:22:40.141 --> 01:22:42.870
I thought that was part of the gift bag after you went to the aquarium that you

1383
01:22:42.871 --> 01:22:46.050
could take one of the fish home.
All right.
Robin Leach,

1384
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.000
uh,
Billy Benz,
uh,

1385
01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:53.670
you're old enough to remember lifestyles of the rich and famous.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1386
01:22:53.671 --> 01:22:56.720
That was great.
That's one of the first,
yeah,

1387
01:22:57.170 --> 01:23:00.740
the blue sort of MTV cribs before MTV cribs,

1388
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:05.840
this Guy Robin Leach and they glorified in and it just all like,

1389
01:23:05.841 --> 01:23:10.070
and when they're sitting at the pool that is don't sit at the pool.
They eat.

1390
01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.990
Escargo I love watching him,
uh,

1391
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:15.560
do an impression for the kids who don't know what he sounded like.

1392
01:23:15.561 --> 01:23:16.970
I can't do an impression of him.

1393
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:20.120
I haven't seen it long enough and I'm not good at impressions unless the persons

1394
01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:25.070
in my life.
Um,
like I can imitate,
I can imitate.

1395
01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:29.360
Um,
I'm working on a Dean del Rey that I'm going to get like a,

1396
01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.180
he always comes back from concert.
Hey Dean,
how was it?
Ah,

1397
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:38.710
it was killer.
He always goes down or if he's talking about some of the,

1398
01:23:38.711 --> 01:23:43.580
there's an asshole.
Oh,
that guy.
That guy's a garbage can.
All right.

1399
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:47.990
The first show to really give you a look at how filthy rich some people are,

1400
01:23:47.991 --> 01:23:50.570
was the lifestyles of the rich and famous.

1401
01:23:50.571 --> 01:23:55.070
I remember seeing an onyx black bathtub and just thinking that all rich people

1402
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:59.060
had black sinks and bathroom fixtures.
All right.

1403
01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.860
For those of you didn't grow up in the 80s,

1404
01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:03.470
if somebody had an all black bathroom,

1405
01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:07.430
they were in the cocaine on an entirely different level.

1406
01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:13.410
They were going Kleinfeld you remember Kleinfeld mum were the most underrated

1407
01:24:15.201 --> 01:24:20.201
Sean Penn character of all fucking time a car in Carlito's way.

1408
01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.840
You got to check that out where he was going.

1409
01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.880
When I love when Pochito said that lie lawyer Kleinfeld you wait a lawyer,

1410
01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:35.510
you are gangster.
Um,
the first show really gave you a,
okay.
Anyways,

1411
01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:39.590
I remember seeing an unexplainable blah,
blah.
Anything stick out from that show?

1412
01:24:39.591 --> 01:24:43.640
Do you have any goals?
Did you have any goals when it came to luxury?

1413
01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:48.740
Um,
no I didn't.
I just,
I just was thinking like,
wow,

1414
01:24:48.741 --> 01:24:52.340
that's amazing.
And,
but I never thought about money.

1415
01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:54.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1416
01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:55.970
<v 1>And it never seemed attainable.</v>

1417
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:57.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1418
01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:01.870
<v 1>Um,
I obviously was saying,
you know,
when I got older that I,
I,</v>

1419
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:05.380
you know,
I wanted the Camaro Berlinetta

1420
01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.920
I secretly liked the z 28,
but my older brother also liked that.

1421
01:25:10.921 --> 01:25:15.030
And I didn't want to say that I liked the same car cause I thought,
you know,

1422
01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:18.630
it would get me into a fistfight,
you know,
cause that's just,
you know,

1423
01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.860
it's how it was back then.
There wasn't any cell phone cameras or whatever.

1424
01:25:22.861 --> 01:25:27.330
Like he just got an give,
just fought your older brother and then you try it out,

1425
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:30.570
shit on your younger brothers to try it on your older brother.

1426
01:25:30.571 --> 01:25:33.630
But he had the psychological advantage and he always beat you.

1427
01:25:34.410 --> 01:25:37.980
So I had to like a different Camaro than he did just to keep the peace.

1428
01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:44.940
But when I was a kid I wanted to have,
um,

1429
01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:49.430
I definitely,
I wanted to have two bulldogs.

1430
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:53.390
I remembered that I was going to name him butch and chopper butch cause I

1431
01:25:53.391 --> 01:25:55.250
thought it was a tough name.
And then chopper,

1432
01:25:55.251 --> 01:25:59.660
there was a cartoon I used to watch and one of the bull dog's name was chopper.

1433
01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:00.740
I can't even remember which,

1434
01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.300
and I was going to have a Camaro Berlinetta instead of the z 28.

1435
01:26:05.301 --> 01:26:06.890
So I wouldn't get the shit kicked out of me.

1436
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:11.390
But by my older brother and uh,

1437
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.390
beyond that,
I don't think the dream,

1438
01:26:14.391 --> 01:26:15.890
I don't think that dream went any further than that.

1439
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.750
I was going to have a Camaro in two bulldogs.

1440
01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:26.200
I never thought about a pool or a finding love for becoming a parent.

1441
01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:30.050
I was a kid.
Yeah.
So I used to just watch that and um,

1442
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:35.180
I never gave a shit about tennis courts and stuff like that.

1443
01:26:35.181 --> 01:26:38.990
I think I,
uh,
I was into sports,

1444
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:44.650
so I think maybe I wanted to have like an incredible wiffle ball field.
Maybe.

1445
01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:48.790
I don't remember.
It was a long time ago,
but,
uh,

1446
01:26:48.791 --> 01:26:52.390
I definitely liked old houses even back then.
Cause we,
you know,

1447
01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:54.760
for most of my childhood,
I grew up in an old one,

1448
01:26:54.761 --> 01:26:58.300
which is why to this day I live in an old house.

1449
01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.490
Um,
and you guys listened to me complain about having to fix it up.

1450
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:08.320
Um,
all right.
Lastly,
but not leastly girlfriend owes me 10 grand,

1451
01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:14.080
but I want a break.
I want to break up,
break up with their serve.

1452
01:27:14.081 --> 01:27:17.650
Because I'll tell you right now,
if you,
if you're with the wrong woman in life,

1453
01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:21.580
her only,
Oh and you 10 grand that you know you're never going to get back.

1454
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:25.480
You got off easy.
Fuck that to go out and crush it in life.

1455
01:27:25.810 --> 01:27:30.280
Find a great woman that deserves you.
Treat her right and you will,
you will make,

1456
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.820
you know,

1457
01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:35.560
and just find a job that you would go do for freak and you will make that 10

1458
01:27:35.561 --> 01:27:39.280
grand.
You throw a bunch of Zeros after it,
you're gonna make it back.

1459
01:27:39.281 --> 01:27:41.080
And even if you don't make back the 10 grand,

1460
01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:44.650
if you have love in your life and you love your job,
it's way better than this.

1461
01:27:44.651 --> 01:27:48.220
I would without even reading this.
It's,

1462
01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:51.880
you're not getting your money back and no one's going to help you because you're

1463
01:27:51.881 --> 01:27:56.800
a man and she's a woman and she's just going to say it was the Gif.
Oh.

1464
01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.600
And she'll cry a little bit and it's going to be over.
Just walk away.
Walk away.

1465
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:07.360
All right.
All right,
dear lunatic off.
That might be my favorite intro ever.

1466
01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.410
I've been dating my girlfriend for about four years and she only owes you 10

1467
01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:12.970
grand.
Dude,
you're getting off easy.

1468
01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:17.470
We dated two years in college and now for our first two years in the real world.

1469
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:21.760
I live in work in New York City and you she only Osha 10 grand.

1470
01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.680
Oh my God.
I'd break up with her and go fucking Max.

1471
01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:29.740
Don't Max out your credit card,
but I would definitely go by a couple of rounds.

1472
01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:33.610
Uh,
I live in work in New York City and while she works here,

1473
01:28:33.611 --> 01:28:36.770
she lives at home since she's from Long Island.
Oh,
I love,

1474
01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:41.560
I love long island chicks.
I have a well paying job for being in my mid twenties.

1475
01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:45.430
She does not make money but luckily lives at home and saves on rent.
However,

1476
01:28:45.431 --> 01:28:49.570
she does have student loans and a car payment.
About a year ago,

1477
01:28:49.630 --> 01:28:54.190
her car needed some serious tuneup work after she got in an accident while

1478
01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:59.191
driving without insurance and she didn't have the cash to cover repairs and the

1479
01:28:59.711 --> 01:29:03.120
repairs of the other cars since the accident was her fault.
Yeah.

1480
01:29:03.121 --> 01:29:06.750
You're dating a child here,
sir.
Uh,
this is not an adult.

1481
01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.320
Her parents really don't have much money,
so she asks me for the money.

1482
01:29:10.321 --> 01:29:13.170
I was hesitant because it's 8,500 bucks.

1483
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.020
It was essentially all of my signing bonus.

1484
01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.440
You got an $8,500 signing bonus,
dude,

1485
01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.010
I,
I don't,

1486
01:29:22.011 --> 01:29:25.310
what the fuck kind of job has a signing bonus where you're not playing in a

1487
01:29:25.311 --> 01:29:30.210
professional sports league,
Dude,
you're crushing it.
Just walk away.

1488
01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.430
8,500.
It was essentially my signing bonus,

1489
01:29:33.431 --> 01:29:37.420
but I knew she would pay me back at the time and at the time I thought I was

1490
01:29:37.421 --> 01:29:41.710
going to marry her.
All right,
so you're a good guy.
Okay.
It's been a little over.

1491
01:29:41.711 --> 01:29:46.711
You were practicing for being married by spending your hard earned money on your

1492
01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:50.130
wife.
Fucking up the car.
I mean,
that's part of being married.
Uh,

1493
01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.400
it's been a little over a year since I lent her the money and our relationship

1494
01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.390
hasn't been great.

1495
01:29:55.391 --> 01:30:00.391
Plus she's borrowed another $1,500 to pay some months of her loans and for a

1496
01:30:00.761 --> 01:30:03.130
Bachelorette weekend in Vegas,

1497
01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.030
I'm going to go out on a limb here saying you're not setting this relationship

1498
01:30:07.031 --> 01:30:11.050
up correctly.
Uh,
she hasn't had much luck finding the job,
the right job,

1499
01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:15.370
constantly bouncing around is taking that built up frustration out on me.

1500
01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:21.490
MMM,
okay.
In all fairness to her,
I haven't heard her side of the story here,

1501
01:30:21.491 --> 01:30:24.910
but,
uh,
this is,
this is not sounding good.
Plus she hates the commute.

1502
01:30:24.911 --> 01:30:28.630
So she's constantly crashing at my apartment and walks around all entitled and

1503
01:30:28.631 --> 01:30:30.700
just makes a mess and eats all the food.

1504
01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:35.700
It doesn't clean up or cook or contribute since it's not her apartment.

1505
01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:39.100
Dude,
you know what I eat?
You should really do.
You don't even need me.

1506
01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:40.990
What you needed to do was to write this letter,

1507
01:30:40.991 --> 01:30:45.070
walk away for three days and come back and reread it,
and you'd have all,

1508
01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.530
you know and just pretend you don't know this guy.

1509
01:30:48.010 --> 01:30:49.930
What would you be saying to this guy right now?

1510
01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.310
Eat The 10 grand and get the fuck out of there.
NFL season's coming up,
dude.

1511
01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:56.470
Get the fuck in sports package.

1512
01:30:57.610 --> 01:31:01.820
Go hit the gym and enjoy your fucking fall.

1513
01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:03.500
As it gets a little colder,

1514
01:31:03.501 --> 01:31:07.660
you get to see the leaves turn and she's not their fucking eaten all your God

1515
01:31:07.661 --> 01:31:11.540
damn cheese.
It's uh,
she seems like she isn't in a good place mentally.

1516
01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:14.090
And even though she says other,
even though she says otherwise,

1517
01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.360
every so often when she makes it outland just purchase.

1518
01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:20.660
I do bring up the fact that she has student loans and owes me money,

1519
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:25.760
which leads to a big fight.
Yeah.
People who borrow money and don't pay it back.

1520
01:31:25.761 --> 01:31:29.420
Always turn it into a fight.
When you actually say like,
Hey,

1521
01:31:29.421 --> 01:31:33.050
are you going to do what you promised to do?
They start acting like assholes.

1522
01:31:33.051 --> 01:31:36.470
This is not a good person,
buddy.
She might eventually become one,

1523
01:31:36.471 --> 01:31:39.770
but you don't have time to wait.
Okay.
You're in the prime of your life.

1524
01:31:39.771 --> 01:31:40.670
You're in your 20s,

1525
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:44.720
you got an $8,500 signing bonus for whatever fucking job you're doing.

1526
01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:48.680
I just hope you're not rating the 401ks of people who uh,

1527
01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:53.620
are too old to get new jobs.
Um,
okay.
Yeah,
dude,

1528
01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:56.470
I would walk away and you live in,
in New York.
Okay.

1529
01:31:56.760 --> 01:32:01.760
There's plenty of responsible driven women out there that don't need a fucking

1530
01:32:03.071 --> 01:32:04.750
guy and you know,

1531
01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:08.470
you can meet somebody that's at your level and that's what you want to do.
Okay.

1532
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.960
If you can marry up but you don't go less than eyeball to eyeball and that's not

1533
01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:16.510
what this relationship is from what you're telling me.

1534
01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:19.630
I haven't heard her side of the story anyways.
I'm truly different from the girl.

1535
01:32:19.631 --> 01:32:20.710
I wait,

1536
01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:24.640
I'm truly can considering breaking up with her because she's so different from

1537
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:26.440
the girl I fell in love with.
However,

1538
01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:29.800
I feel like she for sure we'll never pay me back and we'll drift into an even

1539
01:32:29.801 --> 01:32:32.800
darker place if I ended.
What do you think I should do?

1540
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:35.680
Thanks in advance for your advice and go fuck yourself.
Hey,

1541
01:32:35.681 --> 01:32:36.670
here's something I learned.

1542
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:41.320
Somebody else's happiness is not your responsibility and you holding her

1543
01:32:41.321 --> 01:32:44.920
accountable and actually breaking up with her if she is an adult,

1544
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:50.100
will cause her to take a long look at herself and figure out what she did wrong.

1545
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:54.490
Um,
if Jesus him as immature as you're describing her,

1546
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:58.660
she's going to blame you after you've done all this wonderful stuff for you,

1547
01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:03.520
for her.
Okay.
So like this is a no brainer.

1548
01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:09.370
Um,
this seems like the tip of the iceberg and uh,

1549
01:33:09.371 --> 01:33:13.180
the fact that she's pulling this shit with you and you're not even legally
bound.

1550
01:33:14.110 --> 01:33:18.160
Imagine when you're legally bound and she can take half of ivy thing that you

1551
01:33:18.161 --> 01:33:21.580
fucking make.
Where is her ego going to be there?
Then?

1552
01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.460
She's at the part of the way she shipped right now where she's supposed to be

1553
01:33:24.461 --> 01:33:28.720
pretending to be the person that she isn't and she's already behaving this way.

1554
01:33:28.721 --> 01:33:32.500
So I would say you're just starting to meet who the fuck she really is.

1555
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:35.650
That's the way this is worded.
So I would say,
you know what?

1556
01:33:35.651 --> 01:33:39.700
10 grand that is 10,000 bucks to not be married to.

1557
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:44.050
This is one of the great fucking deals you're ever going to get.
God bless you,

1558
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:48.670
sir.
Enjoy the football season or whatever the fuck you're into,
and,

1559
01:33:48.671 --> 01:33:53.200
um,
go on to live in a great life and beating somebody deserve.
All right.

1560
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:57.460
That's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.
And I'll,
uh,
I'll talk to Ya.

1561
01:33:57.970 --> 01:33:59.980
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
