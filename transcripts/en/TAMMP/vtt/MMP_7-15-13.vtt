Why isn't it around on Monday morning?
Well,

[inaudible] remember that shit?

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.070
That ain't me.
That song's called black dog.

16
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
It's not about a black dog.
He never says black dog.

17
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.450
<v 1>I don't know the dates.
A black dog walked in the fucking studio,
right?</v>

19
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.400
Wasn't wearing a hoodie.

20
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.470
<v 0>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.290
<v 1>So nobody shot it.
John Bonam didn't have to stand his ground.</v>

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.610
Alright,
the fucking dog came walking in
and uh,

23
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.590
you know,
they just called the song black dark.
So there you go.

24
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.940
The Monday morning podcast.

25
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.140
I do it Monday mornings when I wake up,

26
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.240
when I'm in town.

27
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.480
I was on a fucking plane this Monday morning flying from fucking from Boston.

28
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.150
A W people not be a h u Midwestern conch thinking you could do a Boston accent.

29
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.170
It's boff a w Boston,
the red sox.

30
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.910
S AWX like saw like in a shot down a tre.
Can you,

31
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:56.721
can you figure that out?

32
00:01:56.721 --> 00:01:59.630
Damage to green jeans when you're not out there planting food for the fucking

33
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:02.250
country.
Well,

34
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:05.880
can you all right then I was just asking,

35
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.710
you don't have to grab you a little shoulder straps on your overalls.
By the way.

36
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.220
What is that pocket for between your man tits?
What do you stick in there?

37
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:15.420
How you remote control?

38
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.530
You stick something in there for wetland.
She goes,
scrub your nails.

39
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.400
Um,
fuck was I talking about?
Oh yeah,

40
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.310
I was flying back from Boston and uh,

41
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.010
I got upgraded is a classic example of cold lotion.
Everybody.

42
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.630
All right,
I'm in the back of the plane with the fucking animals,
right?

43
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.710
All of us back there clamoring around.
You know,

44
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.080
we all sucked at math so maybe we were good at math.

45
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:49.500
We just want good at fucking,
you know,
getting along with people.

46
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.270
Which one of those is one of the keys?
Main keys to success people.

47
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.760
You gotta be a good shit.
I care how smart you are.

48
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.460
You gotta be somebody that people want to be around.
Alright.
Fairburn.

49
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.720
Einstein was a cunt,
you know,
just stick a,

50
00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:16.520
how many more Japanese people would be around today?
That's so bad.
I'm sorry,

51
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.750
I can never get past that.
He made the bomb.

52
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.980
<v 1>He didn't have to do it,
you know?</v>

54
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

55
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.160
<v 1>Oh,
it's fucking people asking them to make the God thing.
They did not adore it.</v>

56
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.630
He could've just been like,
yeah,
I don't know how to make something like that.

57
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.240
You know,
you're going to have to earn this one there.
Sargent Riker.

58
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.100
Um,
all right.
I'd probably offended at least nine different races at this point.

59
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.940
Let's,
uh,
let's keep going here.
I know there's a point in here somewhere,

60
00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:51.360
so I'm flying back.
So like I,
I'm in the back of the plane.
Right,

61
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.010
<v 0>okay.</v>

62
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.720
<v 1>With the people who say what they feel to their boss.
The people sucked at math.</v>

63
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.870
The people will fucking knocked up somebody that they're not in love with.

64
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.840
You know,
I dunno.

65
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.220
I Dunno what we did to deserve to be in the back of that fucking plane.

66
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:11.813
All right?

67
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.230
But we're back there and all of a sudden I get a little fucking tap on the

68
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:17.300
shoulder and says,
Mister

69
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.410
[inaudible] [inaudible] there's a spot up in our first class cabin.

70
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.730
Is this space available?
You've been upgraded,
you know,

71
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.350
and what do I say?
Do I say,
no,
I'm not going.

72
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:35.250
I'm staying with my people.
You know,
the downtrodden,

73
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.740
the mentally challenged,
not number,
uh,
mentally challenged kind of way.

74
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:45.240
Just like in a,
that guy's not all their kind of way,
you know?

75
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.530
Huh?
Do I fucking hang in there?
Like William Wallace is say,

76
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:55.070
pull out my end trails trying to drag me into first class and say,
no,

77
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.560
I'm not going.
I'm going to stare in my ground.
I'm going to stay here.

78
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:03.680
When the fucking the,
uh,
the,
the,
the main cabin,

79
00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:07.310
I'll let the cut the main fucking cabin.
Right.
Like you feeling like,
oh,

80
00:05:07.311 --> 00:05:11.330
this is the main,
this is the shit.
I'm in the main,
I'm VIP.
No you're not.

81
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.360
She call it the fucking corral or something.
Like the stock aid.
Anyways.

82
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.670
Did I stay with my people?
No,
I didn't.
I sold them out.
I said fuck this.

83
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:23.504
I'm out.

84
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.630
Like the leader of a union spoken with some guy that smells like clam sauce.

85
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.460
There's another group.
Um,
and I go up to the front.

86
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.140
So I went from my fucking knees and my chest
highlights magazine.

87
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.340
Right.
Right in my face.
You know,
whatever they have there,
the Sky Mall,

88
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.930
you know,
cause you want to buy a fucking Mickey mouse,
a ashtray,

89
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.540
whatever the hell they have slash iPod charger.

90
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.460
That's my joke that me and Joe always do.

91
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.910
Our joke I should say about Bobby Kelly,
whatever gadget he has,

92
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.020
where it always ends with and it,
it charges my iPod.

93
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.740
I just bought a fucking guilt out.

94
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.320
It goes clockwise counter clockwise and it charges my iPhone.

95
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:20.780
Kig um,

96
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.980
I'm sorry.
So anyways,
so I go up to him.
I'm fucking excited as hell.

97
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.400
Going to sit in first class with all the big boys,
all the blood money.
All right,

98
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.950
everybody up there,
you know,

99
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:37.580
some bearded fellow with curly cues and diamonds under his hat.
I'm upfront,

100
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.470
I'm upfront with the blue bloods,

101
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.780
people who own horses just to all them because they think they're cute cause

102
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.710
they got to go fucking till the land.
That's how you say it.

103
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.480
So I get up my seat.
Don't think chuck was,
I was a very front row seat.
You can't,

104
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.180
you can't put your shit on to the person in front of you.

105
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.160
So I had to look for an overhead compartment space people,

106
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:04.120
if you could just put your bags in the overhead compartments,

107
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.620
we could expedite the boarding process.

108
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.510
We're trying to have an on time departure.
Um,

109
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.090
they all say the same thing and I fly all the Orange Airlines,
I horror around.

110
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.210
Um,
anyways,

111
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.740
so I fucking get up there and I sit down in my first class fucking cabin seat.

112
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.860
It's six 50 in the morning flight.
All right.

113
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.590
And I am a nice giant pillow.

114
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.300
I have a nice blanket FirstClass everything's Nice and you know,
pay for it.

115
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.740
All those poor saps back in the main cabin.
You know,

116
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.250
some lady going into Labor three months in because her knees is so fucked up

117
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.340
fucking up to her chin,
they don't care.
Okay.

118
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.030
When she has a little three pound babies,
we fly over the Rockies,

119
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.030
they don't care.
They don't give a fuck to them.

120
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.290
That's just another three pound animal to stuff in the back of the fucking
plane.

121
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.480
And at this point,
I don't care because I'm selfish.
I'm about me.
I'm up front,

122
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.410
I'm rubbing elbows with bankers,
you know,

123
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.240
I'm the only person up there without cufflinks,
you know,

124
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.700
standing out like I shouldn't be at the party,

125
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:16.910
but there's nothing they could say about.
So anyways,

126
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.280
I probably got two hours sleep,

127
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.830
which is the best way to get on a plane when you have a long flight.
Okay.

128
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.500
That is the all natural way of knocking yourself out rather than,

129
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:33.501
than taking some designer drug that's going to put your liver in a full Nelson,

130
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.773
you know,

131
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.910
maybe choke it out and give hammer in another seven hammer fist before that UFC

132
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:45.530
ref can slide over.
You know my only complaint about the UFC,

133
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.770
you know,
when was the last time somebody got knocked out and then didn't get an

134
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:55.500
additional four wet prep prep,
prep prep,
miss the fucking guys going.

135
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:59.940
I've never understood that aspect of ultimate fighting.
The fucking guy is out.

136
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.600
You could see these out and if you don't know he's out the entire crowd going,

137
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:11.110
oh it doesn't let you know he's out laying on the ground.

138
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.400
You know you fall down whenever you get knocked out.

139
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.660
It's funny cause like your legs crossed,
like you're watching television,

140
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.160
like enjoying your day off and then your arms.

141
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.460
They always like to kind of moving like Brock and back.

142
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.520
Like don't even know if he noticed that.
They always like go up.

143
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.290
Like you're still in fighting mode and,

144
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.290
but there's sort of like shaking like a,
I dunno,

145
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.880
like your legs are like drilled into the ground in Europe you'll hear toy and

146
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:45.660
somebody just flicked your head fucking e and what have you seen the shit.

147
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.360
So anyway,
anyway,
I haven't gotten onto that.
So anyways,

148
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:50.820
so I sit down there and I'm just like,
all right,
all right.
Oh right.

149
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.950
That's your liver shit.
You don't want to do that.

150
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.623
<v 3>All right.</v>

151
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.640
<v 1>If you want to sleep on a flight,
just don't go to sleep.</v>

152
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.730
Don't sleep the night before you flight.
I mean,
I'll fucking easy as that.

153
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:03.490
How Lazy Are you?

154
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.330
<v 3>Okay?</v>

155
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.500
<v 1>Did you get that from your parents?
I mean,
well,
what's wrong with you?</v>

156
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.040
I don't even think you should be listening to this podcast right now.

157
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:12.090
I think you should sit down,

158
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.970
have a little quiet time to figure out what the fuck is wrong with you.

159
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.630
I'm seriously repulsed by you right now if you'll,

160
00:10:19.631 --> 00:10:22.870
if you fit into the definition of this.
All right?
So you just don't go to sleep.

161
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.790
So that's what I did.
I stayed out with fucking knew the pride in new works,

162
00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:32.140
Paul Versey and uh,
I got two hours of sleep.

163
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.360
I drove my rented Kia,
um,
back to budget

164
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.750
and uh,
yeah,
what have I get on the fucking plane?

165
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:46.190
So I'm just going to go to sleep and I go to press the button to recline my seat

166
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:50.180
and my seat is broken.
It won't reply.
All right?

167
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.360
I got upgraded to first class in my spot.

168
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.820
My seat would recline and right there people,

169
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.730
cause there's a lot of confusion out there,
right there.

170
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.810
That is a classic example of some cold lotion.

171
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.070
Okay?
They're doing something nice for you.

172
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.810
But then there's an awful experience

173
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.820
<v 3>evolved,
right?</v>

174
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.680
<v 1>Look up the definition because I'm sick of people sending me shit on Twitter</v>

175
00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:16.940
going,
oh,
you know,

176
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.810
this guy sent me when I went to this summer league and a watch my,
you know,

177
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:24.710
Portland Trailblazers,
but they lost to the Lakers.
That's some cold lotion.

178
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.490
Now what is it?
The Lakers didn't say,
hey,
we're going to fucking,

179
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.320
uh,
we're gonna lose on purpose tonight.

180
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:34.763
<v 3>You know,</v>

181
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.070
<v 1>I dunno what the fuck you talking about,
sir?
So anyways,</v>

182
00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:44.630
now I'm fucking sleep and upright.
He now though,
I swear to God,
those God damn

183
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.250
chairs on airplanes,
uh,
just unforgiving.
First of all,

184
00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:56.230
the fuselage is just far away from your head that is going to kill your neck if

185
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:57.520
you try and lean your head on it.

186
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.040
So then you get the pillow and the pills a piece of shit,

187
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:02.890
front or back of the plane.
The feathers just scatter.

188
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.710
Especially when you've got a big head like mine,
he can't get that.

189
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.140
Then you try to turn to the side.
All right.

190
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.680
You've tried to turn and lay it at an angle and then he got the,
uh,
the armrest,

191
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.020
which is,
feels like a fucking pistol stuck and you side.
Oh,

192
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.140
it's the worst.
You know,

193
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:21.900
I just threw the blanket over my head because I forgot my eye mask.
And uh,

194
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.880
did you see Superman and eye mask?
Um,
sorry.
Um,

195
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.171
whatever.

196
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:32.200
I just wanted to give you an example of what fucking cold lotion is or look it

197
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:35.620
up on the urban dictionary.
They gave a great explanation of what it is.

198
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.290
I'm tired of fucking correct.

199
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:42.291
And people on Twitter tighter that you could tell it on three shows this weekend

200
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:46.150
screaming my brains out,
cause I don't know how to write a joke.

201
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.640
I said like Peter Brady right now.
Um,
I'm sick of that on Twitter.

202
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.410
And then I'm also sick of the fucking,
uh,
people who go first.
World problems.

203
00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.450
All right though.
That's,
that's the latest.
And the,
the,
the,
the,

204
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:05.980
the lists that I'm beginning for Twitter hack.
All right,
what do we have so far?

205
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:11.010
We have anything that begins with that feeling when that moment when or if you

206
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:16.300
go,
wait,
what?
Right.

207
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.890
I want the last such and such time of my life back.

208
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.940
I just threw up a little bit in my mouth.
All of these,

209
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:28.000
you've heard thousands of fucking times get,

210
00:13:28.001 --> 00:13:33.001
for some reason a select 90% of people on Twitter continued to use them as if

211
00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:35.260
this still funny.

212
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.940
The same fucking people would go out to go see a comedian and if they did the

213
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:43.600
same shit that they already saw him do on TV,
they'd be like,
the show sucked,

214
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.690
you know?
And they go on Twitter and they fucking hack it up.

215
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.050
I know being harsh and you guys cause you just civilians,

216
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.680
but if you want to enter the wonderful world of joke writing,

217
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.020
you need to step up your fucking gay.

218
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:02.700
Why don't you try to find your own voice on Twitter and 180 words,

219
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:05.890
the fucking letters or less,
whatever it is.
All right,

220
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.320
but I'll tell you right now,
I'm a little disappointed in a lot of you.

221
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.510
You're better than that.
Okay?
First of all,
if you live in a first world,

222
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.360
you should never tell somebody that's a first world fucking problem.

223
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.280
As if to remove yourself from your spoiled existence.

224
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.581
You know,

225
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:27.220
like you don't have some roast beef from the fridge that you didn't have to go

226
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:31.060
out and kill and maybe lose your oldest son trying to bring that fucking yak

227
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:33.970
down,
right?
Is that what rose piece come from?

228
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.200
Where does the roast beef come from?
That's some sort of steer,

229
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.740
I guess that's a steer cow.
You get the milk right?

230
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.920
Unless it fucking beats up other cows and then they fucking kill it and they

231
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:49.330
make steaks stares.
You get the steaks,
rump roasts and all that shit.

232
00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:50.320
And then balls,

233
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.190
balls go around and they fuck the cows to make more stairs and more cows.

234
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.020
And my right.
Anybody,
anybody out there?
Farmer,

235
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.920
anybody out there in the fucking cattle game,
the cattle game,
that's,

236
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.890
that's a new movie or working on the cattle gain.

237
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.690
It's about a cow that has a dick and,

238
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.880
and it surprises and unsuspecting bull cause it's already fell in love with
them.

239
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.890
I just spoiled the secret of the cattle game.
Everybody.
Um,

240
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.170
this is the weirdest fucking podcast ever.
All right,

241
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:29.990
let's do a little bit of advertising here of you buddy.
All right,

242
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:33.920
so I can keep the podcast freek for all you fucking wine and cuts out there.

243
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:40.130
Um,
I know what to pay for the podcast.
This too much advertising.

244
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.080
Pick a fucking side.
Mary.
Uh,
legal zoom.

245
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:48.680
Everybody.
Uh,
I,
oops,

246
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.290
that's not it.
That was like a commentary on the fucking thing.

247
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:58.130
What the hell is it?
All right,
fuck it.
Let's call an audible,

248
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.260
like I just came up to the line,
you know,

249
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:03.860
I have to call in a play and I see it defense and I'm given a look to my fucking

250
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:07.340
receiver.
Right?
All I got those,
give them a look.
Marvin Harrison out there.

251
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:12.320
Did you kill anybody last night?
Who did you kill last night?

252
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.280
Wide Receiver.
A Tivo.
Everybody,
uh,

253
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.190
before Tivo watching TV was weirdly hard.

254
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.890
Weirdly hard.
I don't think it was,
I think it was pretty basic.
You know,

255
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:28.670
you turned it on,
you sat down,
you looked at it.
I've got issues with that,

256
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:31.790
but you know what,
I'm going to be a company man and I'm going to play ball here.

257
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.100
Bill burr reads the Tivo ad take to me.
Me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,

258
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.020
me,
me,
me,
me,
me,
me.
Tivo.
Um,

259
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.250
before Tivo watching TV was weirdly hard.

260
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.290
You could only watch a show at a certain time and if you missed it or even a

261
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:49.124
part of it,

262
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.450
you literally had to wait for it to go into reruns before he could see it again.

263
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.420
Now I'm old enough to tell you that that's 100% true.

264
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.840
You missed one episode of happy days.
You didn't know what was going on.

265
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.030
How'd it Chachi knock up Joni?
When did they have a kid?

266
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:08.780
While you miss last week's episode,
have fun.
Wait until July.

267
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.400
Thank God that's all over.
Cause Tivo totally changed all of that.

268
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.130
And while our other dvrs exist,

269
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.130
they're not as sick malicious as Tivo.

270
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.210
Oh they're trying to get the young market here because if you have cable,

271
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:27.020
Tivo lets you watch your shows.
Wherever you want with Tivo stream,

272
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:30.890
you can watch on your iPad all over your house.
That's awesome man.

273
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.080
I actually have a little mini iPad enough.

274
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.960
I got to get this instead of just talking about it.

275
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.490
I should take action and even transfer your favorite recordings and take them

276
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:45.491
with you on an airplane waiting in line at the DMV dentist's office.

277
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.220
Tivo makes other dvrs looked like they were designed by some Soviet committee.

278
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.750
Ah,
take that one.
People over there and partial Europe and Asia.

279
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:59.430
Only Tivo searches for both cable and web to find any movie,
any show,

280
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:03.900
any video at the press of a button,
Netflix,
Amazon,
Youtube.

281
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.750
Now those are just doing so well,
wasn't I.

282
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.010
Now those are just like more channels on your TV and with the Tivo.

283
00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:16.011
Mini one Tivo box works on a second TV from the couch to the kitchen from the

284
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.510
minivan to 35,000 feet.

317
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.050
Why are they acting like the little gold bullions?

318
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.510
They're not the little poor excuses for metal,

319
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:38.511
plastic hunks of crap and they lock them behind the register as if you're buying

some,
I dunno,

Okay.
You don't have to think about it.
You don't have to wait in line.

328
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.630
Get someone unlocked them from a cage and pay way too much money for a bunch of

329
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:11.830
features that don't even fit on your old handle.

Jesus Christ.
All right,
back to the podcast.

341
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:57.260
Here's something you don't get a lot on the podcast.
Everybody.
An apology I owe.

342
00:21:57.261 --> 00:21:58.870
Two major apologies.

343
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.230
Three Jesus Christ.
Where do I start?
Number one,

344
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.610
I trashed World War z before it came out.

345
00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:13.180
The second I saw the rating was PG 13 if you remember from a couple of weeks

346
00:22:13.181 --> 00:22:14.014
back,

347
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:19.410
I said basically that the end of the world is not PG 13 it's like NC 17 if not

348
00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:25.450
18 if that's,
if that's actually a rating.
Okay.

349
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.310
But I actually went out and I saw World War z and I gotta tell you something.

350
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.860
I absolutely loved it.
Not only did I love it,

351
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.090
I feel the PG 13 rating helped it.
You know,

352
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.800
cause we go on and see my act.
My act is probably NC 17 or at least rated r.

353
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.440
And if you really watched me,
I don't know how to write a joke.

354
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.040
That's why I have to scream and jump around and say the f word,
every other word.

355
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.880
And people still laugh because they don't realize I'm just doing a big parlor

356
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:55.150
trick.
That's all it is.
But the great thing is,

357
00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:59.020
is when you go down to PG 13 they actually have to make a movie.

358
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.780
I'm PSN right now,
a bullshit.
And everybody,
I kept it PG 13 there,

359
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.190
you know,
you want to like,
they actually,
they build suspense.

360
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.590
And actually back in the day,
even in rated r movies,

361
00:23:11.591 --> 00:23:14.770
they started building since they used to build suspense,
suspense.

362
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.800
And one of my things that I always hated about a horror movies and big time

363
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:24.610
blockbusters is once all they had all that CGI equipment,
you know,

364
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:28.210
they could have the perfect storm wave and all that crap.
They,

365
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.920
there was no story.

366
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.280
It's just a bunch of people and you just sitting there waiting for the big wave

367
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:37.240
to knock over the boat.
And uh,
one night I watched this movie,

368
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:40.720
dark night of the scarecrow and the movie,
I dunno,

369
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:45.140
there was really scared the shit out of me late at night.
And um,

370
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.030
I was trying to figure out why there was really nothing.

371
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.710
I couldn't figure out what it was.
They were building suspense.

372
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.250
They was scaring the shit out of me in world warZ didn't.
Brad Pitt was awesome.

373
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:03.370
So my apologies to Bradley Pitt Pride of Missouri in anybody else connected with

374
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:08.150
the World War z was a fucking great movie.
I highly recommended.

375
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.580
That's apology number one.
Paul g number two,

376
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.670
speaking of movies for the last two months,

377
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.050
I've been hyping the Billy red state tour,
talking about how all you guys drive,

378
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.740
you know,
a lot of people drive long distances to come and see me and I said,

379
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:25.040
you know what,
I'm going to come and see you.
But unfortunately,
actually,

380
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:28.460
fortunately I ended up getting some acting work and uh,

381
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.490
I can't control when they shoot stuff and it's really a big thing for me and uh,

382
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:35.370
I couldn't say no to it.

383
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:40.370
So unfortunately the Billy red state tour got kind of got split up.

384
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.950
Um,
I've rescheduled all of them.
All right.

385
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.470
I'm not going to totally sell out and just say,
well,
I got act and work.

386
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:52.520
I'm not doing these.
I just rescheduled them.
So this is the deal.
Um,

387
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.500
the first two dates,
Boise,
Idaho in Boseman,
Montana,

388
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.700
those ones are still the same dates.
Everything else got moved.

389
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.230
Um,
as of right now,
the only rescheduled dates I can give you is boulder.

390
00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:11.231
Colorado is September 4th and pikes peak Colorado is September 6th and I believe

391
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:16.510
we're looking at Oklahoma and uh,

392
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:20.240
Kansas deck deck up moved to like November.
This is the deal.

393
00:25:20.241 --> 00:25:23.930
I'm still coming to all of those places.
Just not in the next two weeks.

394
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.530
I apologize.
I know it's the summer you probably said,
hey,

395
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:30.050
I can't go water skiing and bang that chick.

396
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.660
I always wanted to bang back in high school but didn't have the balls.

397
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:34.790
And now I said the right shit.
You know,

398
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.550
I hope I didn't fuck up something like that for you.
All right.

399
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.150
But if you're just going to play frisbee with some cow chips than I think he can

400
00:25:41.151 --> 00:25:44.870
wait a couple of months.
Is that really the apology started off as one.

401
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.190
Um,
and then lastly,
the last apology that I have

402
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.700
is uh,
I have to apologize to jollied all jolly old England.

403
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.800
I usually watch Wimbledon every year,

404
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:01.370
but I've been so busy I missed out and I ended up the one fucking year.

405
00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:03.290
I don't watch it.
Um,

406
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.520
the first English champions since I don't know when I'm going to guess the 1930s

407
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:08.630
again,
Andy Murray,

408
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.080
congratulations for being the first a human being with Dick and balls from Great

409
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.590
Britain.
Or should I say England,
which is Great Britain.

410
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.240
Let's see the United Kingdom,
who gives a fuck about geography,
whatever.

411
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:27.950
He's from England.
I wish I could've seen,

412
00:26:27.951 --> 00:26:31.580
I mean I've even watched a clip of it to see how fucking crazy everybody went.

413
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:36.230
So my apologies.
I should've given you guys your props.
Uh,
that's awesome.

414
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:39.500
I'm sure you guys are still fucking celebrating.
I think that's a great thing.

415
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.920
Great for the sport and uh,
and to sports.

416
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.840
Yet another person from overseas sent me another video about rugby.

417
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:49.290
You know,

418
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.130
one of those clips where they show all these unbelievably hard hits and they are

419
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:54.810
hard hits,
you know,

420
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.220
but they always had kind of have to come at me like saying an American football

421
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.220
is for pussies cause they were all this equipment.

422
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.600
So here's what I have to say to rugby people,
fans of rugby,

423
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.780
who think that American football players are somehow pussies slash not as tough

424
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.240
as rugby.
Uh,

425
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.030
rugby players put it this way,

426
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.680
when rugby players like two,
three years after they retire,

427
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.990
start committing suicide by shooting themselves in the chest because they don't

428
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:29.410
want to damage their brain.

429
00:27:29.411 --> 00:27:33.420
So scientists can look at it after they're dead to figure out why this is so

430
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:38.040
fucked up.
You know,
when rugby players start doing that,

431
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.090
okay,
then,
um,
then maybe you haven't,

432
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.580
even then you wouldn't have an argument,

433
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:48.420
then your sport would be as fucked up as ours,
you know?

434
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:51.390
And if you want to win that contest,
you know,

435
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.050
our support does more damage to our citizens than your stores,
then,
you know,

436
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.740
more power to you.
But I'm just saying,
I don't think rugby guys,

437
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:04.010
they don't kill themselves,
do they?
I have no fucking idea.
I didn't run,

438
00:28:04.011 --> 00:28:07.770
I didn't really research it one way or the other.
Um,

439
00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.930
all right.
So I know a lot of people,
you know,

440
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:15.870
I were asking me questions here.
Wanted me to comment on that.

441
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:19.680
Uh,
that case down there in Florida.
I gotta be honest with you.
Once it went,

442
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.310
it was so racial from the beginning.
That shit just,
uh,

443
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.780
depresses the hell out of me.

444
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.310
It makes me feel like there's never going to be any sort of progress.

445
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.050
I think that there's progress in uh,
you know,

446
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:38.160
maybe stuff in movies and stuff that people say on TV.

447
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:40.470
But I still think people have a lot of the same thoughts.

448
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.570
Unfortunately they do.
And a,
so I don't know anything about it.

449
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.420
All I can say is that I feel a lot of the people,

450
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:51.480
some of the Shit I had actually stopped like following like three people on

451
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:55.170
Twitter cause the shit they were writing was so fucking ignorant about it.

452
00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.300
Um,
basically by ignorant,
I mean not talking about the case,

453
00:29:00.301 --> 00:29:03.750
making it this whole fucking race thing and uh,

454
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.150
and people like that on both sides.
I would say that if it was flipped in,

455
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:10.900
the exact opposite thing happened,
you know,

456
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.250
played out the same way except it was a 17 year old white kid that killed,

457
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.010
got killed by an African American adult.

458
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:20.970
Those same people would completely flip on whether they thought it was guilt or

459
00:29:20.971 --> 00:29:21.510
innocence.

460
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.980
And that's what fucking drives me nuts about the shit and depresses me.
Um,

461
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.900
but I mean,
Bryce was a big thing about it.
I can tell you this right now.

462
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:35.930
If an African American male adult shot a 17 year old white kid,

463
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.850
uh,
with who had skittles and ice tea,
uh,

464
00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:44.290
<v 3>okay.</v>

465
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:48.130
<v 1>I don't know.
I would not want to be the defendant in that fucking case.</v>

466
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.000
Put it that way.
I wouldn't.

467
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.640
So another fucking unfortunate.
It just gets so,
you know,

468
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.170
do you really think,
I actually,
let me ask you this.

469
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:02.890
Do you think people are that ignorant or that they just show the ignorant
people?

470
00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.090
<v 3>Okay.</v>

471
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:06.760
<v 1>You know,
I don't fucking know,
but I get overwhelming.</v>

472
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:11.650
You depressed when I wash it like that,
so I kind of stayed away from it.
Um,

473
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.910
so anyways,
I don't know why I brought that up.
It's just a,

474
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.690
it's a fucking awful topic.
I do have to say though,
for the little,

475
00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:23.980
I know about the stand your ground law,
I don't understand why that exists.

476
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.493
<v 3>MMM.</v>

477
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.590
<v 1>Most other states,</v>

478
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.910
you have to have exhausted any option of,

479
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.960
of retreat.

480
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:35.843
<v 3>You know,</v>

481
00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.370
<v 1>like every martial arts class you ever take,</v>

482
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.910
like they always say the first fucking defense is to avoid it.

483
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.920
If you can avoid it in any way,
regardless of what,

484
00:30:45.921 --> 00:30:48.540
hey you fucking pussy your mother's occurred or whatever.

485
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:53.280
That's just words you supposed to just walk away from something like that.

486
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.481
You know,

487
00:30:54.481 --> 00:30:57.870
in the old and it's just when you get to the point where your back's against the

488
00:30:57.871 --> 00:31:01.980
wall,
you know you got to defend yourself,
which I 100% belief,

489
00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:06.700
but that stand your ground
where your wife's going.
Like,

490
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:10.570
honey,
they're kind of angry.
Let's the drunk.
I think we should just,

491
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.800
I ain't [inaudible] staying in my fucking Brown.
That just,

492
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.660
that just sounds,
that sounds aggressive.
Like,
I don't know.

493
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.250
The stand your ground law and I'm just asking here before you start sending me

494
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:27.760
emails written all in capital letters.
All right.

495
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:33.000
To me that just sounds like
you're escalating.

496
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.620
That's a way to escalate a situation,

497
00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.813
<v 3>you know?</v>

498
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.720
<v 1>Do you know what people fucking stood their ground and just wish that they</v>

499
00:31:41.721 --> 00:31:43.650
didn't,
or in wheelchairs now,

500
00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:48.651
or missing eyes or fucking drool all day long is standing your ground is one of

501
00:31:48.891 --> 00:31:53.690
the dumbest fucking things you can do with a complete stranger who gives a fuck.

502
00:31:53.691 --> 00:31:58.550
They're not in your life,
you know?
Oh,
is that what you think about me?

503
00:31:58.551 --> 00:32:02.510
Person who doesn't know me and I'll never see again.
That's good.
Okay,

504
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.930
you're right.
I'm walking away.
I Dunno,

505
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.060
I don't know much about the law,

506
00:32:08.061 --> 00:32:11.150
but you have reminds me a long time ago when I watched this bouncer,

507
00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:17.240
he walked up,
there was two people arguing and he comes walking up.

508
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.780
Now his job is to fucking,
you know,

509
00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.740
and the situation diffuse it,
right?

510
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.700
Hopefully by just talking,
you know,

511
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.140
so he comes walking up and he says,
Hey,
what's the problem here?

512
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:36.770
And the guy talking to him goes with this guy here,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And He,

513
00:32:36.771 --> 00:32:40.790
and he,
he,
he put his hand on the bounce,
his like more like,
Hey,

514
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:42.740
I want to talk to you to tell you what happened.

515
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.880
And the bouncer immediately goes,
first of all,
don't touch me and I,

516
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.950
I can't do it the way he delivered the line,

517
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:52.220
but I immediately started fucking die and laughing.

518
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:54.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

519
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.810
<v 1>Because what he then did,</v>

520
00:32:55.811 --> 00:32:59.800
he just escalated the situation and then that guy who was mad at the other guy

521
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.580
took the anger he already had and then focus it on the bouncer and then

522
00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:07.510
immediately they're both on the ground rolling around on the floor.

523
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.750
And it was just like,
oh.

524
00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.470
What struck me as so funny was that that bouncer came over there and it was just

525
00:33:14.471 --> 00:33:17.740
like,
did you want to fight the guy?
Why would you say that?

526
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:19.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

527
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.400
<v 1>It should just said,
sir,
I just need you to keep your hands down there.
Thank you.</v>

528
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.360
Now we know what,
what,
what are you saying?
Blah,
blah,
blah.
Go that word.

529
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.890
But it would be like,
first of all,

530
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.630
don't touch making fucking like slap his hand away or whatever.
I Dunno,

531
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.390
I dunno about that.
Stand your ground.
Thanks.

532
00:33:34.391 --> 00:33:38.630
So I'm also very ignorant of as you can tell.
So,
uh,
let me know.

533
00:33:38.631 --> 00:33:40.000
I'm going to wait to,
everything dies down,

534
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.790
then I'm going to try to read up on the fucking case.
But I,

535
00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:47.791
I can't watch it when it's like rolling stone is so frigging to the left and

536
00:33:48.741 --> 00:33:53.360
then you watch Fox News and yeah.
You know,
you know how they are over there.

537
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:53.740
Like it's,

538
00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.490
it's so hard to try and get some sort of like sanity and all of that and uh,
uh,

539
00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:00.530
you combine that with every fucking jerk off,

540
00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:02.300
whereas an opinion can write something on the Internet.

541
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:05.700
I just kind of avoided the whole fucking thing.
Um,

542
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.140
<v 0>okay.</v>

543
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.360
<v 1>Who knows?
Alright,
there you go.
So you asked,</v>

544
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:13.380
I said I hope I didn't fucking piss anybody off and make it any more painful.

545
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:19.260
Um,
all right.
And with that,
hey,
you know something,
somebody wrote something,

546
00:34:19.261 --> 00:34:24.060
some fucked up drink to me that they had that I was in and a actually wrote

547
00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:26.640
something funny back.
I like to think funny back to,
uh,

548
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.140
analyzing his dream just to give you something else to talk and keep the podcast

549
00:34:31.141 --> 00:34:32.610
fresh.
If you guys want me to,

550
00:34:32.611 --> 00:34:37.500
if you had a fucked up dream over the next like six days and maybe one you had a

551
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.410
few weeks ago and it's bugging you and you want me to interpret your dreams.

552
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.910
Alright.
Belper red carpets,
your drapes,
straight straight drains.

553
00:34:44.911 --> 00:34:46.950
Drains will be a new segment hopefully

554
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.930
next week on the podcast.
And they don't,
obviously,
you don't have to be about me.

555
00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:55.080
I hope I didn't confuse anybody there.
All right,
this is gonna be some fucking,

556
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:59.220
you know,
narcissistic thing.
Even though I am sitting here by myself,

557
00:34:59.221 --> 00:35:02.750
I'm too fucking arrogant to have a guest or lazy or whatever you want to call.

558
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.480
If you want to fucking frame it,
that's up to you.
I don't tell you how to think,

559
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.180
so why,
yeah.
If you have a weird fucking dream,
uh,
send it in and I'll,

560
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:14.490
I'll interpret your drape.
Um,
oh,
by the way,

561
00:35:14.491 --> 00:35:16.260
I want to thank everybody who came out this week.

562
00:35:16.261 --> 00:35:20.880
I was in my old stomping grounds.
Uh,
went to the Cape Cod melody tent,

563
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.430
which was a,
uh,
just an absolute,

564
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.670
that was a dream come true to be able to perform in that place.

565
00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:32.080
That's the one and only place I ever saw George Carlin.
And uh,

566
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.630
it was amazing.
I couldn't believe how small it was.

567
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.930
Anytime you're in the round like that many seats looks small because you're like

568
00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:42.930
cutting the ring off.
It's Kinda like how Dane Cook did it when he would,

569
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.890
would do like those giant arenas.
It's fucking brilliant.

570
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.910
Cause if we do one like a giant place like that and you put the stage on one

571
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:51.744
side,

572
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:57.350
it's like that person in the last row up top is a zillion miles away.

573
00:35:57.391 --> 00:36:02.250
But if you put it in the middle,
it's like if I,

574
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.040
you guys do,
you can do the fucking math.
You don't have to be in construction.

575
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.570
You know what I mean?
I'm 50% closer to you and that last row is 50% closer.

576
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.180
The second to last row,
everything is 50% closer.

577
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:14.760
Isn't except for like the front row,
but isn't,

578
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:18.690
isn't there more front row with the circle?
Not Jesus,
I'm all confused.

579
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:23.940
I'm starting to sweat here.
Um,
so anyways,
went down there,

580
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.410
I just had a,
I had a fucking great time and um,

581
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:30.210
I was having such a good time,

582
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:32.790
I forgot to promote that I was selling my DVDs afterwards.

583
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:35.730
So I apologize to anybody who wanted a picture of something like that.

584
00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:40.670
I did come out afterwards,
uh,
there was like 30,
35 people there.

585
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.091
Needless to say,

586
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:49.410
I left a lot of fucking DVDs in a box back in Massachusetts.

587
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.730
Um,
and then the next night I did the Hampton Beach Ball Room Casino,

588
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:58.320
uh,
which is one of my favorite fucking gigs.
Um,

589
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.590
I was up there,
was working with Paul Versey and then a buddy of mine,

590
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:03.870
Wayne Previti,
uh,

591
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.740
who I started off doing stand up with a long time ago back in Boston.

592
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:09.240
And we all hung out and had a great time.

593
00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:13.030
And then the final night was the Newport yachting festival,
yachting centers,

594
00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:15.780
sorry,
which was a,
you know,
an,
an,

595
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:19.770
an air condition tent in a parking lot.
And it was,

596
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.720
I don't know if it was global warming or what,

597
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:24.540
but it was the hottest it's ever been.

598
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.600
I don't know if anybody took any pictures of me when I was on stage,

599
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.050
but I was wearing this button down shirt that was really thin and I thought it

600
00:37:33.051 --> 00:37:34.740
was going to be cool,
but all it did,

601
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.560
it was like you ever workout wearing a great t shirt?

602
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.190
How fucking disgusting you look afterwards.
That's what I look like.
Um,

603
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.003
it was gross,

604
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.440
but I hung in there and actually I got like 50 minutes in and then I just felt

605
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:51.420
like I was,
I got like almost like runner's high.

606
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.930
I was so fucking hot and I ended,
I think I did like an hour and a half.

607
00:37:54.931 --> 00:37:59.100
It was one of the longest I've ever done on stage.
Standing up there and a,

608
00:37:59.101 --> 00:38:04.101
I just had a great time and consume nine zillion calories as I always do.

609
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:07.890
I took Versie on a fucking,
uh,

610
00:38:07.891 --> 00:38:12.240
we should have filmed it on this foodie tour of all this shit that I used to be

611
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:15.750
able to eat in my early twenties and wake up the next day and still have a flat

612
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:20.370
stomach.
Dare I say abs.
I took it like what's great about Massachusetts,

613
00:38:20.371 --> 00:38:25.371
if you ever go out there is like every two to three towns has just some

614
00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:30.210
unbelievable fucking place to get pizza.
And there it's,

615
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:35.270
I think they call it bar bar pizza where it's basically the size of a small and

616
00:38:36.641 --> 00:38:37.474
a,

617
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:38.910
<v 0>okay.</v>

618
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:40.560
<v 1>I'm telling you the place I have,</v>

619
00:38:40.561 --> 00:38:43.380
which I'm not even going to tell you what it is cause I don't want to blow it up

620
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.980
because I want to fucking be able to come back there and get a seat.
Um,

621
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.950
when I did the movie the heat,
um,

622
00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.760
Nate Cordrey told me about a place he knew down off of route three.

623
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:55.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

624
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.490
<v 1>That was fucking unbelievable.
And um,
I don't know.</v>

625
00:38:59.491 --> 00:39:02.280
Maybe if you guys want to have the guys want to out some of your spots,

626
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.230
it's a great thing to do.

627
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.280
And then I took him to this fucking ice cream place afterwards.

628
00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.750
It's like we were on a date,

629
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:14.610
he took them to this ice cream place that's right on a farm.
All right.

630
00:39:14.611 --> 00:39:15.870
And you get a small,

631
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:17.430
<v 0>okay,</v>

632
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.860
<v 1>you get a small fucking dish of ice cream,
right?</v>

633
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.860
And they put the sprinkles on the bottom,
by the way,

634
00:39:22.861 --> 00:39:24.630
in Massachusetts that called Jimmy's.

635
00:39:24.631 --> 00:39:26.700
And I just found out that that's what I heard.

636
00:39:26.701 --> 00:39:31.701
That's actually racist because I guess like that was another term for African

637
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.490
Americans back in the day,
like Jim crow laws.
So Hey,

638
00:39:35.491 --> 00:39:38.540
there's a couple of Jimmy's over their kid or whatever.
So they call it,

639
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:42.840
because the sprinkles lot of times with chocolate called them jimmies.
Right.

640
00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.980
So I probably shouldn't even fucking said that.
Cause now racist will be like,

641
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.210
oh good,
a new way to be a cunt.
But anyways,

642
00:39:50.211 --> 00:39:53.020
so I always say sprinkles when I'm up,
even though that,

643
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.550
that always makes me feel like silly,
saying that like,

644
00:39:56.551 --> 00:40:01.200
could I get some sprinkles?
I'll just a little flustered.
Um,

645
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:06.090
now was that homophobic?
I Made Jesus.
It's just a bear trap wherever you step.

646
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.940
So whatever.
They put the fucking sprinkles on the bottom.

647
00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:12.750
And the small is basically like eating a pint of fucking ice cream so that we

648
00:40:12.751 --> 00:40:14.580
walk over,
we sit on a bench,

649
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.930
me and Paul Versey sitting on a bench in defense of us,
it was made for three.

650
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.390
All right.
We're sitting there eating ice cream,

651
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.140
looking at the cows from the farm where I get they get the fucking cream and the

652
00:40:25.141 --> 00:40:28.530
milk or whatever the fuck they get.
A,
what is the cream come out of the cow?

653
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.240
Is that somewhere around between the tank and the,
uh,
the other there?

654
00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.670
Is that what it is?
Does it got an extra valve?
You know what I mean?

655
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.230
Like that one that's just for hot water.
I don't fucking know.

656
00:40:40.231 --> 00:40:45.060
So we're sitting there and I said,
I shouldn't even tell you this,
not,

657
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.290
I can't tell you this.
I said,

658
00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:49.200
I'm gonna to take a picture of us and I'm going to send this to Nia and she's

659
00:40:49.201 --> 00:40:52.080
going to fucking trash us.
And that's exactly,
I bet them a dollar.

660
00:40:52.081 --> 00:40:55.730
And of course she did.
Um,
and then,
so whatever,

661
00:40:55.731 --> 00:40:59.370
we went up to Hampton beach that night and we,
we do the Gig.

662
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:05.070
Um,
this is a place like Aero Smith when I first started out,
rumors has it,

663
00:41:05.071 --> 00:41:09.990
that led Zepplin actually played there.
If they did,
it's probably one of maybe,

664
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.980
uh,
I know they played the,
uh,
the Boston tea party.

665
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.880
I know they played the whiskey out here in la.
They play,

666
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.770
they literally played like I think a dozen small venues before they absolutely

667
00:41:22.771 --> 00:41:27.390
blew up and just went to,
I imagine large theaters and obviously arenas.

668
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.380
But uh,
last time I was there they were claiming that,
that,

669
00:41:30.381 --> 00:41:33.740
that might have been one of the places that they played.
Um,

670
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.020
and also long time ago,

671
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:38.900
I remember I was in a bad relationship and I walked up the boardwalk and I was

672
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:41.900
like,
I want to get out of this relationship.
I want to turn my life around.

673
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:45.290
And I saw George Carlin's name outside of there and I remember thinking,

674
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.850
that's what I want to be doing.
I want to be doing,

675
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:49.310
stand up not being in this fucked up relationship.
Right.

676
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.880
So we had a great time and then I'm racing back to get some Chinese food at this

677
00:41:56.571 --> 00:41:59.240
place to,
to to I will out displace the,
the uh,

678
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:04.241
the Tahiti and a dead mass and I'm telling you right now you can't fuck with the

679
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:13.040
Chinese food and Massachusetts.
Oh hour,
however far it goes,

680
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.580
where they have a poo poo platter.
They have chicken fingers there.

681
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:20.420
Pork spare ribs,
they're crab.
Rangoon I'm telling you,

682
00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.880
New York,
you don't even know what the fuck good Chinese food is.

683
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.120
New York had the worst Chinese food that the dirty,

684
00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:32.960
his God damn fucking restaurants I've ever been to the Chinese food,

685
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:37.550
every fucking you walk in,
first of all they'd be like bulletproof glass.

686
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:41.840
It was all scraped up and dirty and smudged and then there was this filthy

687
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:45.920
fucking bicycle.
They never mopped the floor.

688
00:42:45.921 --> 00:42:48.590
They were the dirtiest fucking place of everybody to in my life.

689
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.360
You go to fucking the ones up here in Massachusetts or when I was out there in

690
00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:56.630
Massachusetts,
dude,
it was like a fucking lounge.

691
00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.453
Get a score.

692
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.410
People don't write fucking 12 drunks with 12 straws sucking down like five

693
00:43:03.411 --> 00:43:07.940
different alcohols with Hawaiian Punch in there.
These big lounges,

694
00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.060
these fucking looking like a look at that.

695
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.400
That shit on the Brady bunch where they lost the Tki.
Everybody,

696
00:43:13.401 --> 00:43:17.330
everybody fucking dawn hall walking by with a Ukulele,
which I know is Hawaiian.

697
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.660
I don't give a fuck.
It was great insane food.

698
00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:24.320
So I did this thing with the,
uh,

699
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.570
I hate when I have an early flight and I have to get,

700
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:31.630
I have to fill up the tank with gas because I always end up almost missing my

701
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:33.620
flight.
Um,

702
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.210
so finally I chose the full tank of gas option,

703
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.320
which sucks because then you got to drive around on ie cause you don't want to

704
00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:45.320
get fucked because if he come back with a half a tank that still charging you

705
00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:49.220
for a full tank and the fuck over extra price,
you know,

706
00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:54.080
for a gallon of gas.
So I'm driving back from New Hampshire and,
uh,

707
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:58.100
the fucking light is blinking that we're going to run out of gas and we already

708
00:43:58.101 --> 00:44:00.770
ordered food.
And versus sitting there,
gone not to,
we're going to make it,

709
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.130
we're gonna make it.
And we pulled in,
we made it,
we got the food,

710
00:44:04.131 --> 00:44:07.130
everything was great.
And I came out to start up the fucking SUV,

711
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:11.660
little poor excuse for an SUV and it did the start.
That's how low on gas I was.

712
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:15.250
It was on fumes.
And fortunately I read up a little bit on,
uh,

713
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.720
cars and I was thinking of water.

714
00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:20.990
If I pump it a little bit and then maybe I can get a few drops out of the fuel

715
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:25.340
line and get across the street and it happened,
started the fucker up,
you know,

716
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.270
cause my dumb ass,
that's how little I knew about cars.
I wouldn't,

717
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.010
I wouldn't have stepped on the gas more.
I would've

718
00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.060
<v 0>okay</v>

719
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.310
<v 1>that w I just would assume there was nothing left.
Um,</v>

720
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.420
and then we ate it and then the next day my stomach was 10 times fucking bigger.

721
00:44:40.421 --> 00:44:42.580
But you know what?
I stand by it.
I had a great time.

722
00:44:42.581 --> 00:44:46.390
Listen to Paul versus a podcast.
I guarantee you the verse,
the effect,

723
00:44:46.391 --> 00:44:50.410
he brings it up this week.
Um,
all right,
let's get back to the,

724
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.020
let's do a little advertising here,
a little freak,
little frack here.

725
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.850
A stamps.com everybody,

726
00:44:54.851 --> 00:44:59.460
I've already told you how not to have to ever go and have to buy a,

727
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.630
what do you call blades for your razor anymore.
So already right there.

728
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.090
That's one less trip you have to make out of the house.

729
00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.700
Where his his one less trip number two.

730
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:13.510
So that would be two less trips unless you decided to go run errands.

731
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.950
Doing both at the same time.
I don't know how you live your life.
All right.

There are a lot of places we want to go,

734
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:27.910
but the post office isn't one of the driving their parking waiting for a clerk.

735
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.410
What a hassle,
man.

736
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:34.000
Why don't you just use stamps.com instead stamps.com anything else?

742
00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.770
You'll never have to go to the post office again.
I'm going to say that again,

743
00:45:56.771 --> 00:45:57.280
people.

744
00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:02.280
You'll never have to go to the post office again unless you're some Weirdo that

745
00:46:02.381 --> 00:46:03.400

746
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:08.020
I use stamps on stamps.com to send out all my DVDs.

747
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.720

755
00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:40.390
All right.
Legal Zoom.
Most most Americans don't have a will,
but why?

756

Well,
I guess a lot of us don't own enough stuff.

788
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:45.080
I have an idea.
I have an idea as they say.

789
00:48:45.081 --> 00:48:48.320
Why don't we read a couple of letters?
Bulgaria,

790
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.650
Bulgaria be buddy that's an eastern Europe,

791
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:55.670
just south of the Ukraine capital is uh,

792
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.140
don't tell me.

793
00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

794
00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.010
<v 1>Ah,
Shit.
I had this one</v>

795
00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.910
is that Sophia was at Belarus.
Look at that.

796
00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:09.400
I didn't Polish up on them for one fucking week.
No,
it's Sophia,

797
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:13.260
right?
Then what the Hell is Belarus?

798
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:15.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

799
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:20.060
<v 1>A Chrysler can't even fucking remember anymore.
What an asshole.
Yeah,</v>

800
00:49:20.061 --> 00:49:22.730
it is Sophia.
But what's Belarus now I'm looking it up.

801
00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.870
Doodoo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Zip Is Ipap Papa.

802
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:33.050
Oh,
I can't sing that song or else the ghost of a big headed mo there.

803
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:37.690
He gets the money.
I pat say Jack.
What the fuck's his name?

804
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

805
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.240
<v 1>Yeah,
it gives a fuck.
All right.
Bulgaria urge.</v>

806
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.330
You mentioned Bulgaria in the last podcast.

807
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.410
The hairs around my asshole rose up and excitement that you would visit.

808
00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.520
I checked your schedule and there are only two euro cities listed.

809
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:55.730
Go Fuck Yourself.
You cunt.
Um,

810
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.710
despite your tone,
despite our insulting,
you just were,

811
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:03.400
I feel as though that.
Um,

812
00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:04.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

813
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:08.280
<v 1>You really don't feel I'm that I just feel you're disappointed.
All right,</v>

814
00:50:08.281 --> 00:50:11.850
so I'm going to plow through all your anger that you just sent me and I have to

815
00:50:11.851 --> 00:50:12.620
ask you this.

816
00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:16.380
Bulgaria is one of those those countries I don't know anything about,

817
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.770
and as an American,
if you don't know anything about the country,

818
00:50:19.771 --> 00:50:23.760
you have to assume that it's a dangerous place for Americans to go.

819
00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.730
Part of that is ignorance.
The other part is our foreign policy.

820
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.780
We've pissed off a lot of people,
so I have to ask you this.

821
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.850
You seem to have command,

822
00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:33.440
<v 0>okay,</v>

823
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.870
<v 1>I'll be it in an angry way of the English language.</v>

824
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:38.060
Could I actually go to Bulgaria and a fight?

825
00:50:38.061 --> 00:50:41.990
Do what is what is there to do there?
Is it war toward,

826
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:48.050
have you made a comeback?
Let me,
let me hear about Bulgaria and in general,

827
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:49.790
let me hear about Eastern Europe.
What's go,

828
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.700
what's going on over there at Bosnia and Herzegovina?

829
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

830
00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:58.660
<v 1>Slovenia,
Slovakia,
Hudson Pfeffer,
cooperative.</v>

831
00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:03.710
But we're going to do with just a couple of eastern Europe car making be even

832
00:51:06.331 --> 00:51:10.950
fucking Milwaukee.
We're gonna Shave our mustaches for you.

833
00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:14.070
Potato dilemma.
Hey Billy,
red face.

834
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:19.100
I find myself at a big career decision point in my life and I'm not completely

835
00:51:19.381 --> 00:51:20.220
sure what to do.

836
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.800
I'm a 22 year old guy and I studied languages at a university here in Finland.

837
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.160
Oh,
hall of Nokia.
Um,

838
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:34.220
on many summers I've worked for a potato packaging company that is owned by my

839
00:51:34.681 --> 00:51:38.430
father's side of the family.
That's fucking awesome.

840
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.190
See that right there.
You know why that,
that,

841
00:51:41.191 --> 00:51:46.191
that guy and his family are secure is that is about as tangible as it gets.

842
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:51.420
Potatoes,
you can hold them in your hands.
You stick them in a package,
right.

843
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.580
Just like the old days.
Uh,
recently my cousin who works there,

844
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:57.960
uh,

845
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.770
regularly at work there regularly asked me whether I'd be interested in joining

846
00:52:01.771 --> 00:52:05.610
him and taking over the company as the old low owners.

847
00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.740
My uncles and my dad are retiring soon.

848
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.440
I never had much of a relationship with my dad,

849
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:15.180
but he's still likely be happy to have one of his children take over now.

850
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.190
I don't really know if I should accept the offer.

851
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:22.590
I would likely secure it would likely secure me a pretty good living in my adult

852
00:52:22.591 --> 00:52:26.400
life.
But the thought of being able to see my future laid down before me,

853
00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.050
like that is a bit scary.

854
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:32.550
So far I've never really planned ahead and honestly I ended up in the university

855
00:52:32.551 --> 00:52:36.300
studying English just because I didn't know what else to do.
Well,
you know what?

856
00:52:36.301 --> 00:52:40.800
As far as I know about a Finland over there,
don't you guys pay like 90% tax?

857
00:52:40.801 --> 00:52:45.090
But everything's taken care of.
You know,
health insurance,

858
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.330
college tuition is,
is all paid.

859
00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:52.950
Hence don't you guys have a problem over there with people like you,

860
00:52:52.951 --> 00:52:56.880
young people who don't know what they want to do,
everything's taken care of.

861
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:02.160
Why go out in the real world and have 90% of your check go out the window for

862
00:53:02.161 --> 00:53:04.800
shit that you're not going to be using unless you get a fucking hemorrhoid.

863
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.520
Right?
They kind of created the terminal college student.

864
00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:12.600
Um,
I'm just asking anyways,

865
00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:16.710
this has led to some lack of motivations and my studies as I don't really know

866
00:53:16.711 --> 00:53:21.630
where I'm going going with it at all.
Um,
I just haven't had a plant,
by the way.

867
00:53:21.631 --> 00:53:24.900
How great is this guy's English better than me?

868
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:29.280
I just haven't had a plan and I've always felt like a bit of an underachiever in

869
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:33.060
my family.
He knows the word underachiever.
I know some French words.

870
00:53:33.061 --> 00:53:36.350
I don't know what underachievers under achiever.

871
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.360
It's a five syllable fucking word.
I barely use that in my own language.

872
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.040
I applaud you sir.

873
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:46.820
I'm with all my oldest siblings having gone to successful careers in education

874
00:53:47.341 --> 00:53:51.360
and medicine from their university studies where I've just been drifting along

875
00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:55.080
with no destination so far.
Uh,
as a regular employee,

876
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:58.020
the work and the potato company has never been terribly exciting.

877
00:53:58.021 --> 00:53:58.711
But as the owner,

878
00:53:58.711 --> 00:54:01.530
I'd obviously have more control and what kinds of things I could do.

879
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.250
There's also the possibility that I could refocus my studies into something more

880
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:07.200
business oriented,
uh,

881
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:09.690
maybe taking over the marketing side of things in the future.

882
00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:13.170
Should I accept this offer or should I wait until I found a career path I feel

883
00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:16.080
more certain about,
I just don't know if I'm ever going to find it.

884
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.210
Obviously I'm lucky to even be in this situation.
Uh,

885
00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:22.820
but it's just a bit overwhelming to have such a big decisions,
uh,

886
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.400
to make it this age,
which I haven't really thought about seriously before.

887
00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:31.280
Thanks.
Have a good day and go fuck yourself.
Um,
doe this,

888
00:54:31.281 --> 00:54:33.590
this decision's all going to be in your gut.

889
00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:36.340
You're going to have to go with your gut,
dude.
I can't,

890
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:40.660
I can't make the decision what you should do with your life.
Um,

891
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:45.820
I do feel that you should have a passion if you want to have fun at work,
uh,

892
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.360
for what you do and um,
you know,

893
00:54:50.361 --> 00:54:52.700
but if you just kind of floating around aimlessly,
you know,

894
00:54:52.701 --> 00:54:56.330
huff and out of a bong,
maybe this could,
could be a good thing for you.

895
00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.750
I'm just playing devil's advocate.
I don't know what you're doing.
All right.

896
00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.490
And I also imagined that,
you know,
if you take this and you don't like it,

897
00:55:04.491 --> 00:55:08.570
you could always sell your stake in it to the other person,

898
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:11.540
your cousin or whatever that you're going to go into business with.

899
00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:13.250
So it does give you an asset,

900
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.050
which is something that a lot of young people don't have.
Um,

901
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.500
gives you a little bit of footing.
I don't think it's the worst thing.

902
00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:25.580
I mean,
I don't think potatoes are going out of style.
Are they?

903
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:29.030
People always gonna need potatoes.
Um,

904
00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:32.690
I dunno,
but at the end of the day,
dude,
you're going to have to make,

905
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.230
you're not going to have to make that decision.
Um,

906
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.660
personally I would not want to be in the potato business,

907
00:55:40.661 --> 00:55:44.180
but I would love to grow some in my own yard.
By the way.

908
00:55:44.181 --> 00:55:49.181
Everybody I told you about how we planted some cucumbers and tomatoes and

909
00:55:52.071 --> 00:55:52.904
peppers,

910
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:58.360
I can't recommend it enough when they finally are ripe and you bring them in,

911
00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.680
it's like fucking magic.

912
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.360
And I live in a climate out here where I can grow them all year round.

913
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:09.770
I haven't had the tomatoes yet,
but Nia picked one and sent me a video.

914
00:56:09.771 --> 00:56:14.330
She bit into it like an apple.
And um,
I don't know if you guys know a lot of,

915
00:56:14.331 --> 00:56:17.360
you know,
with the tomatoes,
a lot of just vegetables in general.

916
00:56:17.361 --> 00:56:20.900
They pick them before they're ripe and they let them ripen on the truck.

917
00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:24.670
But basically the second you pull it off vine,
you know,

918
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:27.510
it's not getting any more nutrients.
And that's why a lot of like,

919
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:32.320
especially tomatoes just suck at least in this country,

920
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.670
which is why when you order a Capri Salad,
you know,

921
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.610
they have to put that Balsamic vinegarette on it to give it a little bit of a

922
00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:42.130
fucking,
uh,
the Balsamic,
whatever the fuck they put on it,

923
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:45.370
to give it a little zip to make up for the sugar that's not in the,

924
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.600
in the tomatoes,
that sweet tastes that's not there.

925
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.340
At the same thing when you make your pizza sauces,

926
00:56:50.341 --> 00:56:53.500
you've got to throw some sugar in there because tomatoes over here suck.

927
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:57.940
But if you grow your own,
um,
you don't have to worry about that.

928
00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:01.090
The only thing you have to worry about is no one went to fucking take them off,

929
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:03.730
which I fucked up with the cucumbers.
I took them off too soon.

930
00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.473
<v 3>MMM.</v>

931
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.830
<v 1>But it's the greatest thing ever.
So getting back to the,
uh,
the,</v>

932
00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.000
what you're doing here,
sir.
And by the way,

933
00:57:11.001 --> 00:57:12.590
I'm going to have a whole fucking garden,

934
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.863
<v 3>you know,</v>

935
00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.830
<v 1>and then I figure what I'm going to use for protein is,
uh,</v>

936
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.590
the rabbits that I killed that try and steal my vegetables.

937
00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:28.200
I'm going to be eating a lot of varmints,
a lot of fucking,
uh,

938
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:31.190
some rabbit stew,
some possum soup,

939
00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:32.733
<v 3>you know,</v>

940
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:39.510
<v 1>fucking Raccoon Burger,
you know,
side of rabies.
Um,</v>

941
00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.220
yeah,
dude,
I w you're 22 years old.
I mean,
I don't at 22.

942
00:57:43.221 --> 00:57:46.160
I really don't think you should know what the fuck you want to do with your
life.

943
00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:47.933
<v 3>MMM.</v>

944
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.190
<v 1>Buying it on a business and some fucking old man shit.</v>

945
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:55.270
You should at least own one pair of suspenders before you make a decision like

946
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.110
that,
I would think.

947
00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:58.143
<v 3>MMM.</v>

948
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.770
<v 1>But I get what you're saying like this,
this,</v>

949
00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.820
this window of opportunity might not be open when you're 23,

950
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.130
and then what if you fucking don't find something else?
Uh,
you know something,

951
00:58:10.131 --> 00:58:13.880
dude,
by the time I was 22,
I knew I wanted to be a comedian.

952
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:18.310
So at 22 if you don't,
they feel you want to be a potato farmer,

953
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:23.630
then that's probably a pretty good indication,
you know?

954
00:58:23.631 --> 00:58:26.760
Although you also have to take into effect that,
uh,

955
00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.260
are taking it to our fucking hour,
the expression goes,

956
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:34.310
you got to factor in the fact that I'm super imposing when I figured out what

957
00:58:34.311 --> 00:58:37.070
the fuck I wanted to do onto your life,
okay?

958
00:58:37.071 --> 00:58:41.390
Some people don't figure out to they're 40.
So I would go with my gut all right?

959
00:58:41.391 --> 00:58:45.320
And have faith in yourself as a human being that yet,
you know,

960
00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:48.980
your life is your life and you're on your journey.
Okay?

961
00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.550
And when you meet the person you're supposed to be with,
or you,
you meet,

962
00:58:52.551 --> 00:58:55.620
you find the career,
you're supposed to be

963
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:00.130
the job you're supposed to be doing in life,
you're going to feel it.

964
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:04.390
I'm telling you,
when you find that in life that you never questioned it.

965
00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:09.880
You know?
And this is feeling of relief and excitement,
you know?

966
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.100
So unless you look at a field of potatoes growing and it gives you a lump in

967
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:17.650
your throat because it's so goddamn beautiful to you.

968
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.680
I don't think you want to do it.
That's what my gut says.
All right.

969
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.350
Well like said,
that's a huge decision decision.
You gotta make it for yourself.

970
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.740
Okay.
I hope that helped.
And uh,
go fuck yourself right back at you.

971
00:59:28.741 --> 00:59:30.230
And I'll be over there in December.

972
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.880
You know what the London dates selling really well.

973
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.010
I know I don't have a mall up there,

974
00:59:37.011 --> 00:59:40.130
but I don't post dates until this ticket links because then I got to deal with

975
00:59:40.131 --> 00:59:43.310
people going like,
well,
well why in the fuck are texts go on sale?
I don't know.

976
00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:48.950
All right.
All right.
Moving on.
Weight loss.
Everyone.

977
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.310
A belt.
Just wanting to say,

978
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:57.020
I'm representing you here in Maine on the last couple of the episodes you've

979
00:59:57.021 --> 01:00:00.060
brought exercising and fatty.
Oh,

980
01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.040
I guess brought up exercising and fatties you forgot the up and wanted to let

981
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:08.330
you know that you've given me an extra motivation to keep off the weight.
I've,

982
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.380
I've lost in nine months.
I've lost a hundred pounds on the mark.

983
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:16.550
Hang on a second.
Good for you,
sir.

984
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.210
Good for you.
That's 500 miles of capillaries.

985
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:23.420
Your heart doesn't have to pump through every fucking beat anymore.

986
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.000
I can't even remember.
That's even right.

987
01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:29.620
Every pound of fat is five miles of capillaries.
Huh?

988
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.610
You fucking kidding me?
That's why even an exit,
10 pounds extra 10 pounds,

989
01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:38.690
you slowly killing yourself.
Hundred pounds,
dude,
congratulations.

990
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.380
He goes a 22 and a 225 pounds.

991
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:46.790
I've never looked or felt any better.
The question I wanted to ask you is,

992
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.830
what is your take on diets?

993
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.370
I just control my portion sizes and lay off junk food.
Also,

994
01:00:52.371 --> 01:00:55.850
I try to drink at least 1.5 gallons of water a day.

995
01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:58.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

996
01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.290
<v 1>Ah,
dude,
you gotta be careful with that.</v>

997
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.390
You can actually die from drinking too much water.
1.5 gallon.

998
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:09.110
You're a big guy though.
If you're fucking 225 pounds,
you still in shape.
Um,

999
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.620
I would look into that,
man.
Are you sure that's how much you're drinking?

1000
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.400
Anybody listening to this?

1001
01:01:14.401 --> 01:01:19.070
And please do not go out and drink 1.5 gallons of water in a day.

1002
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.110
You're not supposed to drink like eight glasses.

1003
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:23.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1004
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:25.290
<v 1>And even I,
you gotta Watch out.</v>

1005
01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:29.880
This is something we can literally drown yourself.
We'll use the cell walls.

1006
01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.510
Like,
I can't remember,
they did this radio contest.

1007
01:01:33.511 --> 01:01:35.250
Whoever could drink the most fucking water,

1008
01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:39.180
one an x box and some mother went in there to do it for a kid.

1009
01:01:39.181 --> 01:01:42.960
She ended up dying.
It's fucking horrific.
But anyways,
let's,

1010
01:01:42.961 --> 01:01:47.220
let's just go back to the sea goes.
Is that,
is that too much?
Um,
I would,

1011
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.200
I would go to a doctor on this one buddy.

1012
01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.060
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1013
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:51.900
<v 1>Um,
he says,</v>

1014
01:01:51.901 --> 01:01:54.810
nice putting out the podcast definitely keeps me focused on my car to go days.

1015
01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.250
Thanks.
Um,
do I believe in diets?
No,
I don't.
I think they just make you miserable.

1016
01:01:59.251 --> 01:02:01.830
I think it is portion control and you cut out bad foods.

1017
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.720
You just have to get through those first three,

1018
01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:08.100
four days to seven days where you're,
you're not craving,

1019
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:13.320
you're not on that salt,
sugar,
salt,
sugar,
you know,
back and forth,

1020
01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.940
junky.
Most people,
even if they are in shape,
like are still fighting that battle,

1021
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.900
like a,
not in the best of shape,
but I'm not in bad shape either,

1022
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.800
but I fight that all the fucking time.
And I actually,
you know,

1023
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:29.610
I got that ice cream with [inaudible] and the next day I was driving by it again

1024
01:02:29.611 --> 01:02:34.260
and I had the urge to go back and get some more fucking ice cream,

1025
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.070
you know,
justifying it like,
well,
I'm not going to be here.

1026
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.890
I don't know how many more months.
If I lived here,
I'd go here all the time.

1027
01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:45.150
But Bob on,
I said,
fuck that and uh,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1028
01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:48.960
I'm out here wishing I did get it the second time and um,

1029
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.140
but I'm glad I didn't.
So,
um,

1030
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:54.510
the fuck am I talking about?
Yeah,

1031
01:02:54.511 --> 01:02:57.150
I believe in a portion control dude is you just have like,

1032
01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.390
usually the shit they say of a protein the size of the palm of your hand and

1033
01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:03.030
he'd just have vegetables with no statues of cabs.

1034
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:06.630
You do that like before seven o'clock at night,

1035
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:11.250
just drink water the rest of the night no more just,
and then you go,

1036
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.230
just go for a walk around the block before you go to bed and then don't eat

1037
01:03:16.231 --> 01:03:19.200
again for like 12 hours until you wake up.
It's seven again.

1038
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.230
It just sucks the first couple of nights.
Then your body gets used to it,

1039
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.070
so you won't be filling those hunger pangs.
And uh,

1040
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:30.840
and then,
you know,
you just keep doing that.
You wake up,
you have fucking oatmeal.

1041
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.300
There's nowhere for the fat to go.
It has to leave.

1042
01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:37.080
He's getting kicked out by good food.
That's what I would do.
And you know what,

1043
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:40.540
I would do that I never really did.
I would read up on nutrition,
uh,

1044
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:45.660
a great guy to actually follow on Facebook as Eddie Brill from the Dave

1045
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.210
Letterman show,
standup comedian.
Um,

1046
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:53.430
like I learned so much shit just by following him on Facebook.
Like he,
he's,

1047
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:57.060
he's broken it down all the way down to the bottled water.
If that,

1048
01:03:57.061 --> 01:04:00.600
he'd rather drink out of the tap from some of the shit that he's reading about

1049
01:04:00.601 --> 01:04:03.570
bottled water.
It's amazing.
But,
um,
there's a bunch of stuff out there.

1050
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:08.340
There's other things you can do like eat,
uh,
eat and seasoned,
um,

1051
01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.790
gold.
Go to farmer's markets and then actually know what's in season.

1052
01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:15.390
Like I'll tell you right now,
peaches are in season.
I've never been,

1053
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.620
I never had peaches in my diet and I just started eating shit that was in
season.

1054
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.400
Peaches and seasons are fucking unbelievable.
Like if you get a peach right now,

1055
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.760
you got to eat it over the sink.
It's the smoke,
the most insane thing ever.

1056
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:30.330
And one of the greatest things you could ever eat after,
uh,
after cardio,

1057
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.220
you know,
I don't know.
So wait,
what am I fucking,

1058
01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:39.090
who's that guy with the candy striped shorts,
you know,

1059
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.020
with the tank tops and the fucking balding Afro.
What the Hell's his name?

1060
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:46.940
Richard Simmons.
Oh,
Bill Simmons here.
Oh,
Bill Sevens.

1061
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.440
I supposed to be doing this podcast.

1062
01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:52.460
I worked for fucking trying to work out a date,
uh,

1063
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.960
where I can come in and do his podcast.
All right?

1064
01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:58.950
A fat person is saying thank you.
Look at me.
I'm,
I'm a,

1065
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:02.910
I'm inspiring the fat east.
Um,

1066
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:06.180
dare bill Baer,
Billy Aaron Burr.

1067
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:11.400
I've been fat or obese most of my life and I want to thank you for shaming me

1068
01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:13.860
into losing weight and getting into shape is,

1069
01:05:13.861 --> 01:05:16.500
see that shame works.

1070
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:22.240
Most people might get offended when you talk about fatties and gluttonous
people,

1071
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:27.390
but I took your criticism and jokes to heart and went from 430 to 220.

1072
01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:30.250
Wait a minute,
look at this.

1073
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.360
He did it a little under 18 months and he goes,
I'm not done yet.

1074
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:38.620
I'm almost 40 years old.
And my goal now is to get to 180 pounds,

1075
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:41.620
which I haven't been since I was in the seventh grade,

1076
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.930
but I will settle for a little less than 200 pounds.
Do,

1077
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.890
do you understand that you basically just saved your fucking life.

1078
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:52.990
You're 40 years old and you're 430 pounds.
You're not long for this earth.
Okay.

1079
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:57.400
And the greatest example,
when was the last time you saw a 430 pounds?

1080
01:05:57.401 --> 01:06:01.990
70 year old.
How about a 60 year old?
How about a 50 year old?

1081
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.700
Have you seen even like a 50 year old,
you know.

1082
01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.390
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1083
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:11.480
<v 1>He just,
you can't,
you can't do it.
He just can't fucking do it.</v>

1084
01:06:11.481 --> 01:06:14.780
So good for your man.
And you know anybody else who's fat.

1085
01:06:14.781 --> 01:06:17.420
When I do these fat jokes,
I'm,
I'm rooting for you,
man.
I,

1086
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.570
I try and make everything fine.
Make Fun of myself for going bald,

1087
01:06:20.571 --> 01:06:25.520
being a redheaded cunt.
All right.
Don't take it.
I want you to lose.
All right,

1088
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:29.840
good for you,
dude.
That's insane.
That's what,
210 pounds.

1089
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:36.180
He lost a cornerback.
That's unbelievable.
Uh,

1090
01:06:36.181 --> 01:06:39.870
I am almost 40 years old now and my goal all got,
I read that part.
He goes,

1091
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.180
I feel like a new man board.

1092
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:45.300
I most I'm most happy about is how much my dick is growing.

1093
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:51.120
Wow.
All right.
This just took a fucking left turn.
He goes,

1094
01:06:51.121 --> 01:06:55.320
because of all of the blubber.
I Ha I had,
oh,
because all the blubber,

1095
01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:58.290
I had no idea,
but it looks like I had,

1096
01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:03.590
I have at least an eight inch cock and that makes me a lot more confident about

1097
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:06.480
myself.
Well,
dude,
how long have you been fat?

1098
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:10.180
You must have been fat before puberty cause you said you were,
you,

1099
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:13.110
you were a 180 pounds in seventh grade.
Ah,
dude,

1100
01:07:13.111 --> 01:07:15.690
you were that kid right there.

1101
01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:18.630
Plain shirts and skins and you sitting there praying and praying to God,

1102
01:07:18.631 --> 01:07:23.310
they don't get you for skins.
Ah,
man,
that's fucking brutal.

1103
01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:27.750
Good for you.
Look at him after all these years.
He found his dick.

1104
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.390
That's tremendous.
Um,
he goes,
I know it's going to be hard,

1105
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:38.610
but uh,
I work out at least two hours each day and five days each week.

1106
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:44.350
Thanks for being a jerk off.
Some people need tough love.
I owe it all to you.
Ah,

1107
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.430
I don't know,
man.
I got you going,
but you fucking did it.

1108
01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:52.200
You work out five,
two hours each day,
five days a week.

1109
01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:56.190
Look at this comes full circle.
Now you're,
uh,
you're inspiring me.

1110
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:57.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1111
01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:00.160
<v 1>I was going to take today off cause I flew on a plane.</v>

1112
01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:04.540
Be a big pussy who I flew across the country.
I can't go walk around the block.

1113
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.970
Um,
good for you man.
That's fucking awesome.
All right.
Now,

1114
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.820
now that you're actually going to live past 50,
do me a favor.

1115
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:18.230
Speaking of 50 don't drive in the fucking left lane.
All right.

1116
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:22.070
If you're making a left and the light turns green,
get out into the intersection.

1117
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:24.410
So not only the guy behind you but the guy behind him.

1118
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:28.520
We can all fucking make it.
All right.
Other than that,

1119
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:32.960
go back to Eaton Sundays cause we can't use you.
I'm kidding.

1120
01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:34.580
Don't do it.
All right.

1121
01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.680

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:08.720

I have to believe that's all the uh,
advertising,

1144
01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:14.480
right?
Is that right?
That I read them all?
Let's scroll through here.
Yes,

1145
01:10:14.481 --> 01:10:19.430
I did a righty.
Nothing but uh,
nothing but the jokes for the rest of the way.

1146
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.860
All right,
let's read another letter.
Um,

1147
01:10:24.861 --> 01:10:27.740
where are we?
All right.

1148
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:32.960
Hypocrisy of the female gender.
Oh Gee,
Jane.

1149
01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.560
Come on guys.
Come on ladies.
You know what?

1150
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.810
Women trash the guys.
Let's have this fucking be balanced here.
Fair and balanced.

1151
01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:45.080
All right.
What do we got here?

1152
01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:49.550
Hypocrisy of the female gender.
My fucking,

1153
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:53.360
my batteries are going to run out here.
I got to get through this one quickly.

1154
01:10:53.361 --> 01:10:53.900
Hey Bill,

1155
01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.900
Aka Aka bill Jizette shot during the summer.

1156
01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.240
That really has nothing to do with my name.

1157
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:08.450
That's just sort of my first name and then a cum shot.
But you know,

1158
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:12.830
you tried,
he goes,
I'm in a bit of a pickle.
Lacy got Jill's.

1159
01:11:12.831 --> 01:11:17.310
He's a Phallic Vegeta.
Is that a vegetable?
It's a pickle.
A vegetable or a fruit.

1160
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.490
Well,
let's see.
Bill,
you're planting cucumbers.

1161
01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.133
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1162
01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:26.290
<v 1>It's not on a tree.
It's in the ground.
It's a fucking vegetable.</v>

1163
01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.770
Look at me and miss the fucking green jeans here.
Anyways.
Could be serious.

1164
01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.670
Could be just something that'll blow over.
But I'd like your opinion.
Anyway.

1165
01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.520
Um,
here we go.

1166
01:11:36.521 --> 01:11:40.780
A few days ago while I was getting a coffee,
I saw my girlfriend,

1167
01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.610
girlfriend's best friend,

1168
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:47.050
kissing a dude that doesn't look like her boyfriend,

1169
01:11:47.410 --> 01:11:49.480
but like the rational human being that I am.

1170
01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.480
I thought I asked my girl before I jump to any conclusion.

1171
01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:56.950
So I asked her for boyfriend,
still her boyfriend?
She said yes and asked why?

1172
01:11:56.951 --> 01:12:01.420
So I told her what I saw and her reaction is something I didn't expect.

1173
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:06.280
She went silent.
So I asked her if she already knew and said,

1174
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.980
and she said yes and beg me not to tell the guy.

1175
01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:12.700
So I said that I'd like to hear your here,
the weight.

1176
01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.390
So I said that I'd like to hear the story first.

1177
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:19.610
Oh my story first.

1178
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:21.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1179
01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.770
<v 1>I Dunno what the fuck.
Well,
I'm just going to read the way he wrote it.</v>

1180
01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:28.210
So I said that,
I said that I'd like to hear the story first so I can assess hi.

1181
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:32.770
I want to go about the situation.
I'm sorry.
And she refused.
So I said,

1182
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:35.980
I guess it would be the same way if you were cheating on me.
Huh?

1183
01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:39.700
You would act the same way and you two would conspire over it.

1184
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.560
And she denied that,
started crying and said she would never cheat on me.
Uh,

1185
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:48.790
I told her it was fucking bullshit that she's implying that this can't have a

1186
01:12:48.791 --> 01:12:52.900
best friend,
has even the slightest legit reason to be a piece of shit.

1187
01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:56.650
And I eventually left to go get some air though.

1188
01:12:56.651 --> 01:13:00.460
It was difficult since she caused a scene and started screaming down the hall

1189
01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:02.830
from me.
I love when they do that.
Right.

1190
01:13:02.831 --> 01:13:06.130
Cause I mean the second a woman's starts screaming in public,

1191
01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.480
the guys like at the very least a borderline rapist.

1192
01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.010
Um,
all right.

1193
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.730
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1194
01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:18.970
<v 1>Well so far.
Okay.
I,
you know,
I'm going to read,
just read the rest of it goes.</v>

1195
01:13:18.971 --> 01:13:21.970
At that point she was breaking down crying and asked me to come back,

1196
01:13:21.971 --> 01:13:25.260
but I was fucking done.
The funny thing is about this,

1197
01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.560
the funny thing about this is I barely even know the guy.
I met him like twice.

1198
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.900
He seems like a cool down to earth guy and all,

1199
01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.480
but I don't really owe him anything yet.

1200
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.590
What's happening just triggers something in my mind and I feel like I should

1201
01:13:38.591 --> 01:13:42.610
tell him multiple people know his girlfriend is cheating on him and he has no

1202
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.473
fucking clue.

1203
01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.740
I really lost a lot of respect for my girlfriend but she's always talks about

1204
01:13:47.741 --> 01:13:51.430
loyalty and how important it is to her and now she hates cheaters because she

1205
01:13:51.431 --> 01:13:54.700
knows how it feels to be on the other end.
What a fucking hypocrite.

1206
01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.890
When confronted with the situation head on.
She just excuses it and,

1207
01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:02.230
and mitigates it with secret.

1208
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:04.360
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1209
01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.870
<v 1>What mitigates it was secret court,
NSA legal reasoning.</v>

1210
01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.950
So I have to believe.
Oh,
did it cut out?

1211
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:16.690
Cutting out.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Something sounds weird.

1212
01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:20.770
I think it's still taping,
right?
Oh Jesus.
All right.

1213
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:23.350
Trying to read even faster here.
Um,

1214
01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.170
the fuck is going on with the sound now.
Hang on.
Hang on.

1215
01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.280
Hang on there.
We got back and I'll bet.

1216
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.160
Um,
this is the worst read ever.
I'm sorry,

1217
01:14:38.161 --> 01:14:39.240
because this is a very interesting,

1218
01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.010
<v 0>okay.</v>

1219
01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.890
<v 1>Uh,
I can't even look her,
look at her or talk to her right now.</v>

1220
01:14:43.891 --> 01:14:47.880
Just thinking about the way she reacted to all of this still pisses me off.

1221
01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:50.280
So what should I do here?
Do I tell him?
I don't know.

1222
01:14:50.281 --> 01:14:53.190
Maybe I should just say fuck him.
You can't save the world.
Right?

1223
01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:54.510
And what about my girlfriend?

1224
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.320
She's quick to say cheating's wrong until her and her group are on.

1225
01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.820
Are the ones doing the cheating?

1226
01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:04.080
Am I just slowly riding along this shit to eventually to eventual heartbreak?

1227
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:08.900
Helped me out.
Bill,
you sexy based you.
Um,

1228
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:11.720
all right,
well there's a lot of variables here.
Uh,

1229
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:18.990
it's really the cheating girlfriend has put your girlfriend in a position

1230
01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.573
<v 3>mmm.</v>

1231
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:27.090
<v 1>Where she's dragged her into her shit.
You know,</v>

1232
01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.260
where now she has to choose between her friendship to her and her feelings about

1233
01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.750
cheating and um,

1234
01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:36.210
<v 3>okay.</v>

1235
01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:37.590
<v 1>I imagine it's her friend.</v>

1236
01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.710
She loves her and she doesn't want to blow up her life.

1237
01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:42.443
<v 3>MMM.</v>

1238
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:45.500
<v 1>I Dunno.
I think,</v>

1239
01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:49.880
I think what really needs to happen here is you don't need to get involved.

1240
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:52.460
I think your girlfriend

1241
01:15:55.230 --> 01:16:00.230
needs to go to her girlfriend and tell her the situation that her cheating has

1242
01:16:00.481 --> 01:16:04.280
put herself in and that she needs to fucking end it

1243
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.550
<v 0>okay</v>

1244
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:09.900
<v 1>with this other guy and grow up and start acting like a fucking adult because</v>

1245
01:16:09.901 --> 01:16:10.920
they're pieces of shit.

1246
01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.980
Behavior is affecting your girlfriend's relationship and where you never had

1247
01:16:18.331 --> 01:16:22.320
trust issues.
You now do,
you know,
I'm not saying that your,
your,

1248
01:16:22.321 --> 01:16:26.580
your thoughts that your current girlfriend will now cheat on you are unfounded.

1249
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.240
But there's two sides to loyalty to where you know,

1250
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:34.650
you help your friend move a body,
you know,
there's people like that,
like,

1251
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:40.470
you know,
just Jeter might be stringing your girlfriend along going,
I know,

1252
01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:43.800
I'm just confused right now.
I'm sorry.
I just need,

1253
01:16:44.130 --> 01:16:45.690
I feel like it needs something different,

1254
01:16:45.691 --> 01:16:50.640
but I still love Mike and I'm trying to,
I'm just doing a little Dick shopping.

1255
01:16:50.641 --> 01:16:54.270
I'm sorry I had to see it.
It's like the cock farmer's market,

1256
01:16:54.271 --> 01:16:57.750
whatever the fuck she saying.
Right.
Um,

1257
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

1258
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.190
<v 1>Fuck her friend.
I feel bad for the other dude.
What are you going to do?</v>

1259
01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:06.010
I would just sit down with your,
your,
your girlfriend and just be like,
look,

1260
01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:09.540
this is what happened.
This is what has to go down.
All right.
You don't,

1261
01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.000
whatever the fuck I just said,

1262
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:14.750
you need to go talk to your girlfriend and tell her that she needs to fucking

1263
01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:19.340
clear up her situation because it's affecting my relationship.
Okay.
Grow Up,

1264
01:17:19.341 --> 01:17:24.000
break up with this other fucking guy,
you know,
and uh,

1265
01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.360
get on with your life.
That,
that's what I would suggest.
And,
um,
and,

1266
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.980
but I don't think you're wrong to now be looking at your girlfriend.

1267
01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:33.050
Like what the fuck?
And a,

1268
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:36.470
I never believe when a woman cries when you call them out on shit.

1269
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.670
I never do because I don't believe the,

1270
01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:44.720
I don't believe the crying as a rule because they can cry on cue like Meryl

1271
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:48.800
Streep,
you know,
um,

1272
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.170
they just,
they just have access to that emotion and uh,

1273
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.160
it automatically makes them the victim.
It makes you feel like you're a bully.

1274
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.490
I think you're 100% right to feel the way you did a,

1275
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:05.900
you might've gone at or a little too strong a and convenient option.
Uh,

1276
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:08.930
I hope it works out for you.
Um,
in the meantime,

1277
01:18:08.931 --> 01:18:11.900
do you think you're going to marry this girl?
Because if you don't,

1278
01:18:11.901 --> 01:18:12.890
you're just wasting time.

1279
01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:17.420
And this is a great fucking a jump off point to get the fuck out of it.
You know,

1280
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:21.050
NFL football starts next month,
that money is spending on her.

1281
01:18:21.051 --> 01:18:24.620
Going to the movies would look very nice with the NFL package.

1282
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:28.730
You've got a lot of options here,
sir.
I'm good luck to you.
All right.

1283
01:18:28.731 --> 01:18:30.110
That's the podcast for this week.

1284
01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.110
Thank you for everybody who came out to my shows.
I really appreciate it.

1285
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:37.010
And thank you to everybody in the red state tour,
um,

1286
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.890
for being patient.
I'm definitely getting out there.

1287
01:18:39.891 --> 01:18:42.350
I'm still bringing the t shirts.
I'm still doing the shows.

1288
01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:45.410
I'm just not doing them all at once.
Like I wanted to,

1289
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.020
I don't get to drive across the great state of Montana,

1290
01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:52.340
but I get to see some of it.
I drive from Boise over,
um,

1291
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.410
and I still get to go to deadwood.

1292
01:18:54.411 --> 01:18:56.180
I just have to figure out when I'm going to do it.

1293
01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.300
But I'm definitely coming and I apologize for the reschedule.

1294
01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:03.310
Just something beyond my control.
So I couldn't say no.
I had to do it mean,

1295
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:06.050
I mean,
who the fuck am I?
Right?
I get eight lines in a movie.
I,

1296
01:19:06.051 --> 01:19:08.600
if I get a bigger part,
I got to take it.
All right.

1297
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:11.780
So this is not the last time this will happen,
but I will promise you guys,

1298
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:16.400
if I ever move a date,
I will always make it up.
I don't say,
Hey,
fuck that city,

1299
01:19:16.401 --> 01:19:17.810
cause I know how this business works.

1300
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:21.170
You can get all the way up to win an Oscar and three years later you're in a

1301
01:19:21.171 --> 01:19:25.880
movie about talking babies.
All right?
I don't want to do that shit.

1302
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:29.770
And if I fuck over Kansas City,
then they're not going to come out to my shows.

1303
01:19:29.771 --> 01:19:33.290
So I don't take you guys for granted.
All right?
And with that is the outro.

1304
01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:36.380
Now the show's over.
Don't forget to support our sponsors.

1305
