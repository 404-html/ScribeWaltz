1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.971
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:01.971 --> 00:00:05.160
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.730
December 26th,
2016 what's going on?
Oh Wow.

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.680
Yeah.
Oh my God.

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.280
It's the last Monday of fucking 2016.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.210
George Michael passed away on Christmas Day.
Um,

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.960
wake me up before you'd go go condolences to him.

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.500
And uh,
you know what the best thing about 2016 being over is,
is,

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.053
um,

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.440
you know longer you're going to have to listen to people blaming a year for bad

11
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:45.390
things happening.
You know,
that's a big thing.
Fuck you.
2016.

12
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:49.500
I saw Madonna tweeted that.
Fuck you.
2016.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.660
Fuck you.
You fucking year man.
You know,

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.980
why do people keep blaming the fucking year?
You know,

15
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.570
it has nothing to do with the fucking year you're talking to.
There's,

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.230
there's people's genetics are involved.
There's a lifestyle choices.

17
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.470
There's substance abuse.
I mean,
that's what's going on here.

18
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:15.150
I don't know why you're a,
you know,
we're picking on 2016 like,

19
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.640
it's a,
a religion from the Middle East or something.

20
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:21.180
I have no fucking idea how it's getting the blame for all of this.

21
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.060
You know what I mean?
Fucking 2016 with your liver cancer,

22
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.080
you know,

23
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.760
let's blame 2016 rather than the pharmaceutical companies that fucking was

24
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.750
giving out opiates like Flintstone vitamins and created a fucking heroin

25
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:39.640
epidemic.
Fuck all of that.

26
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.000
2016 has robbed us of some of the greatest artists of our time.

27
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.360
2016 did like,
it's a fucking person.

28
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.240
How to fucking Madonna.
Madonna is world travel.
She,

29
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:56.250
she's been around the fucking world.

30
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.810
However you talked to enough people to not know to blame a fucking year.
Well,

31
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:05.760
maybe she's saying it metaphorically,
Bill.
I don't give a shit.
You know,

32
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.620
if I try to see her side that things,

33
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.880
how can I come up with the comedic angle to try to fill out this next fucking 60

34
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.150
minutes?
Fuck you.
2016 oh yeah.

35
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:19.270
You didn't like seeing the cubs finally win a world series.
Ah,

36
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.620
nothing good happened to you this year.
You're just going to focus on the bad.

37
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.680
<v 0>Anyways,
I liked people always and try to have like a religious thing.</v>

39
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.381
Like when a prince,

40
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:34.450
his backup dancers had this whole fucking religious thing that she went on

41
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:39.130
saying like,
you know,
like wake up people,
you know,
that's,

42
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:41.140
that's when you know you're out of your fucking mind.
You know,

43
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:43.390
when you start telling people to wake up like,
like you're,

44
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:44.860
you're reading the fucking a,

45
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.360
you're reading the tea leaves better than anybody else in your fucking,
you know,

46
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.940
garrison colonial,
wherever the fuck you live,

47
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.270
wake up people he capital h is,

48
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:59.200
is taking a robbing us of some of our greatest,

49
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.990
you know,
like that's a sign like all these,

50
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.830
these great musicians are leaving us,
which means like what?

51
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>

52
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.070
<v 0>Like Jesus is mad at all the fucking plumbers and electricians and shit.</v>

53
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.820
Granted they fucking overcharge you and they lie about when the date,

54
00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:20.310
the date of whatever is going to be done,
the job's going to be done.

55
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.880
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
I don't fucking know mean</v>

56
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.260
<v 0>I don't understand on a stand blaming him fucking year.</v>

57
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.013
<v 2>You know,</v>

58
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.021
<v 0>dude,</v>

59
00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:35.520
I just can't wait for this year to be over and then it's going to be 2017 I'm

60
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:39.330
not going to do any work on myself and I'll basically make the same fucking

61
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:43.770
decisions I made in 2016 but somehow 2017 is going to be better without me

62
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:48.730
having to make any effort whatsoever.
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

63
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.420
why don't you just get out your rosary and say all your fucking prayers rather

64
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:57.421
than fucking making a positive step towards trying to make a real change.

65
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.863
<v 2>MMM.</v>

66
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.040
<v 0>Anyway,
so let's talk about that Madonna thing.
When she was shaking her folks,</v>

67
00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:08.990
she was talking with that fucking woman,
Jesus Christ.
Unbelievable.

68
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.440
I just like,
I hate that she does that because it makes me feel old.

69
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.173
<v 2>You know,</v>

70
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.590
<v 0>when she was,
she was all happy say,
hey a fucking day.
Anyways,
let's plow ahead.</v>

71
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:24.210
This is not,
this is not why I wanted to do this thing here.
Um,

72
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.040
did you guys have a nice holiday?
Did you have a nice [inaudible]?

73
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.040
Did you have a nice chat?
Hanukkah?
Did you have a nice Christmas there,
Jim?

74
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.600
Hey,
Jewish people do.
Do you guys like how many you actually,
uh,
when I was a kid,

75
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:40.660
people who weren't Jewish told me how you guys celebrated Hanukkah.

76
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.870
And I realized,
well,
they weren't really Jewish where they,
let me ask you this.

77
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:46.150
Do you do,
how many people do the traditional,

78
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.120
is it a one day thing or is it like a nine day thing?

79
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.710
How many candles are on the manure is at the same as a baseball team.
And if so,

80
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.940
do you give fucking one gift a day for nine days?

81
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.240
Like total old school,
you know,

82
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.140
we're baking our own bread here type of thing.
Right?
Is that are actually,

83
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:09.460
is that a religious story?
Isn't that there's always bread.
There's always bread.

84
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:12.250
There's always fish.
There's a fucking leper,
you know,

85
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.160
and then there's always the one guy,
Abraham Muhammad or Jesus,
right?

86
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.330
Hoggin up the whole fucking budget.

87
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:23.380
Like the same way they make movies nowadays we're Tom Truth gets all the fucking

88
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:28.200
money,
right?
He gets all the fucking money.
And what about those character actors?

89
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:32.250
They I go fuck yourself.
Right?
You know,
back in the day you could,

90
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.100
you could make a living as a character actor.
You know what I mean?
Not Anymore.

91
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.270
That's not how it works.
Not In the age of,
uh,

92
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.730
the fucking superhero movies.
So anyways,
let me see how many days of Hanukkah.

93
00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:47.060
Why don't I,
why don't I look this up?
Happy Hanukkah.

94
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.120
Happy Hanukkah.
All right.

95
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.500
How many days in

96
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.263
<v 2>I [inaudible]</v>

97
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.490
<v 0>is eight days</v>

98
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 3>a days a week.
All right,
so it's eight days.
Sorry.</v>

99
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:06.290
Nine guys on a baseball team.
Eight days.
Anaqua do you fucking give a gift?

100
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.590
Every deaths the traditional way as far as the non Jewish people told me that

101
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:14.450
they give a gift to date.
Now if you do that,
my question,
my question to you is,

102
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.350
how do you give out those gifts?
You know,

103
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.400
how do do you do it?
Like how I do a stand up set?
Well,

104
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:23.780
you gotta start with something strong.

105
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.740
You got to establish that you're the fucking man for the job,
right?
Yeah.

106
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.960
<v 0>I don't mean to be sexist about that,
but when you really think about it,</v>

107
00:06:31.961 --> 00:06:36.610
men do a better fucking job just generally speaking.

108
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.160
You know what I mean?
Women have been nowhere near the fucking moon.
Okay.

109
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.830
And we were there like,
fucking how many of you that I'm fucking years ago,

110
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:46.664
where are we?

111
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.753
<v 3>You know?</v>

112
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.480
<v 0>Oh Jesus.
I just thought,</v>

113
00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:52.750
I just thought of one of the worst fucking jokes ever and I will not say it,

114
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:57.130
but I'll describe it to you.
Okay.
I will describe it.

115
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.040
I can't do it.
I see.

116
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.080
The only way to get away with it is if Nia is here also laughing.

117
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:05.380
I was going to say,
you put the guys out in the space,
you know,

118
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.520
we get all the way to the moon.
You know,
you try to bring a lady up there,
right?

119
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:11.920
You see where I'm going?
I can't do that.
It says they have to Christmas.

120
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:15.640
I would not do that.
Um,
anyways,
eight days.
So what do you do?

121
00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:18.340
Do you start off with the fucking something strong.

122
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:19.200
<v 3>Okay.</v>

123
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.830
<v 0>You know,</v>

124
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.060
and then you establish like this is the little level of gift giving and you

125
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:28.890
gradually start your ascent through days.
Two,
three,
four,
five,
six.
Woo.
Whoa,

126
00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:31.310
we're going to another level is seven and eight.
You gave me all A's.

127
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.800
You're fucking gift now.
Fuck off for a year.

128
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.150
That's how I would do it if I was Jewish.
All right.

129
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:41.610
Me and Neil would Jewish and I had to get near eight gifts.
All right.

130
00:07:41.611 --> 00:07:46.050
What would I start off with?
I'd start off with some shoes,
right?

131
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.900
Cause bitches be loving the Jews,
right?

132
00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:53.400
I give her the fucking some shoes then a Jesus Christ.

133
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.230
Fucking eight gifts.

134
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

135
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.010
<v 0>Yeah.
We got to go.
Go close.
No,
you know what?
I would start right out of the gate.</v>

136
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:04.610
I'd start with something silly.
You know like her stocking stuff for this year,

137
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:07.670
like I know like she knows certain kinds of food she likes.

138
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.570
Like one year I told her,
like I said,
I know I'm going to get you for Christmas.

139
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.540
She could wait yet.
I'm going to go and eat.
I'm getting you a bag of Fritos.

140
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:17.300
Right.
She just kept laughing,
you know,

141
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:19.610
thinking it was the funniest thing ever that I wasn't actually going to do it.

142
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:22.820
So of course the first gift I gave her,
she opened it up,

143
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:26.780
it was a bag of Fritos and I gave her a big bear hug and I was like,
oh,

144
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:28.660
this is the greatest Christmas ever.

145
00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:31.610
And she thought it was the funniest fucking thing ever.
So if we were Jewish,

146
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.040
that's what I would do.
I would start off with stupid fucking gifts.

147
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.790
Cause who's kidding who?
I'm not going fucking broke here.
All right.

148
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:42.410
Is it Christian?
A nonpracticing Christian?
I don't get my wife a gifts a year.

149
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.920
You know what I mean?
Dude,
you guys should do it like a game show.

150
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.360
Okay.
Do you want a pretty good gifts?
Uh,
one fucking great one.

151
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.580
That's like,
when you win the lottery,

152
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.620
do you want to it all at once or have get paid a hundred grand over 20 years?

153
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.480
And anybody who always takes the payments doesn't understand money.
And also,

154
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.780
you know,
it's just like,
well don't go to me.
Oh well it's,
I've got to blow it.

155
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.650
You get it all at once even though you were in a bigger tax bracket.

156
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.960
You know what I mean?
It gets you over the hump into being a fucking millionaire.

157
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.080
I don't give a fuck how much money you make.
If they give you 200 grand a year,

158
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.290
you're never going to get up over the million cause they're going to fuck it.

159
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.850
They got a tax the shit out of you.

160
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.080
They take it all at once roughly.
I mean,

161
00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:31.510
you could do it if you just fucking set to written corn flakes and shit,

162
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.500
but like if you take it all at once and then you invest it,

163
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.260
but you're not going to know what to do.
They wasn't there.

164
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:43.000
A whole documentary on that.
I have no idea,
but my wife,

165
00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:43.930
fortunately I'd like to give,

166
00:09:43.931 --> 00:09:46.090
since you gave me this year and you know it was funny and made fun and getting

167
00:09:46.091 --> 00:09:51.091
socks for Christmas and she got me socks that she was all embarrassed.

168
00:09:51.131 --> 00:09:54.220
She goes,
he said it on Thursday that you didn't like saying I like socks.

169
00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.560
I'm just fucking around.
There was,

170
00:09:56.561 --> 00:10:01.240
that was the only thing in my stocking this year,
she bought me a little box.

171
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.270
Three pairs came in this little box a little,
he was gonna be cookies.

172
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.570
I opened it up with some tape.
Baker,
take his socks and uh,

173
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.350
I don't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?
Like I said,
I'm an adult.

174
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:15.760
You can give me a Choo Choo train.
Silver.
It's fucking over.
Um,

175
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.500
so anyways,
um,
okay,

176
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:22.540
I'll tell you this quick story.
Fortunately,

177
00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:26.810
Nia light her gifts and I always have a little bit of anxiety whenever I give a

178
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.390
gifts because,
uh,
first my first girlfriend I ever had,

179
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.440
I think I told you this story before,
did I?
Um,

180
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.040
my first girlfriend I ever had,
I had to get her a gift.

181
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.980
Now I didn't grow up around the ladies.

182
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.290
I just said brothers for the longest fucking time.
Right.

183
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.680
And I don't mean black people.
I mean,
I mean I had like,

184
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.970
I was related to these people.
I had brothers.
Um,

185
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.470
so,
um,
this cough is never gonna go away by the way,

186
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.740
cause the fucker prescription I got,
you know,

187
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.340
just fucking put it down on the mat and now it's just fucking hanging around

188
00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:08.290
like this thing.
They won't leave.
I know you guys are thinking,
oh,

189
00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.210
he must be smoking like a chimney.
I'm not,

190
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.280
I'm not fucking smoking at all a slash I might be done with cigars.

191
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.210
Um,
and I'm Kinda,

192
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.460
I'm kinda done with booze too.
I,
you can't fucking do it anymore.
You know,

193
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:25.990
I love it and all that shit,

194
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:30.960
but I just hate waking up in the morning like old,
you know what?

195
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.930
I'm over hangovers.
Fuck you.
20,
60.
Um,

196
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.380
yeah,
I'll have like a beer.
I'll,
I'll have like,
you know,
uh,

197
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.780
one glass of Scotch at this point,
but I can't do the fucking,
uh,

198
00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.710
I can't take the ride anymore.
You know what I mean?

199
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.090
And it just hit me one day,
like,
you know how quickly Brett Farve got old,

200
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.470
just done over out of the fucking league.
You know,

201
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.490
he hung around and he hung around and he hung around and then he took that last

202
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:03.280
fucking hit when he was on the Vikings.
You know,

203
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.720
it just looked like his clothes were just laying on the ground,

204
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.500
didn't believe there was a person,
you know,

205
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.710
and all the really religious people got all concerned that you know,

206
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.450
that they get left behind and it's like,
no,

207
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:17.190
that's what it looks like when a fucking 42 year old guy takes a hit from his

208
00:12:17.191 --> 00:12:19.820
fucking defense event.
Um,

209
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.180
<v 3>yeah,</v>

210
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.200
<v 0>yeah,
I'm fucking done within all of that shit.
Uh,
however,</v>

211
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.650
let me tell you the story that the first girlfriend I had,
so it was,

212
00:12:28.651 --> 00:12:32.220
her birthday was coming up and I had absolutely no idea.

213
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.350
<v 3>Okay,</v>

214
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.540
<v 0>what to get a uh,
a female.</v>

215
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.143
<v 3>Okay.</v>

216
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.340
<v 0>Should I go to the mall and I'm looking around,
I'm looking around,</v>

217
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.360
I had no fucking idea.

218
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.160
And I came up to this table and they had all these polo style shirts,

219
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.080
nice shirts,

220
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.770
shirts I would wear and they were on sale and all that stuff and it just,

221
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.270
all these different colors.

222
00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:56.560
So I bought her like four of them and I wrapped him up and I gave them to her

223
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.210
izods and Polo shirts and shit.
And she fucking unwrapped these things

224
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.300
and the level of disappointment on her face.
And she just was like,
what?

225
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.660
What is,
what is this?
What the fuck dude?
She just fucking went off.

226
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.580
She flipped out.
She started yelling at me like,
like a,
you know,

227
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.230
like a head coach mad at halftime,
you know,
you know,
I said,
kicked the ball,

228
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.230
you're kicked out by Tony Jacket,
you know,
flipping out on me.

229
00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:27.920
And I literally did,
I was so embarrassed.
I like kind of put my head down.

230
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.580
I looked at my feet and they just sat down on the edge of the bed as she was

231
00:13:31.581 --> 00:13:32.414
yelling at me.

232
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:33.750
<v 3>Okay.</v>

233
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.940
<v 0>Right.
And uh,</v>

234
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.250
I don't know what happened.
I like,
I was so fucking embarrassed and she,
you know,

235
00:13:43.251 --> 00:13:43.811
I was young,

236
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.780
I didn't know anything about women and shit and she was just going off on me.

237
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.630
And about three quarters of the way into,
we're a rant,

238
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.360
which was really a good 90 seconds long,
by the way.
Which is fucking forever.

239
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.310
I think she was kind of coming to her senses that she was taking in what she was

240
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:03.730
doing to me by my body language and the fact that she just given,

241
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.800
gotten a gift and the way she was reacting and,
uh,

242
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.320
she started to try to pull back on the stick and be like,
oh no,
you know,

243
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:14.230
it's Kinda,
and that's when the anger fucking hit me.

244
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:18.060
That was one of the first times in my ute that,
um,

245
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.590
<v 3>okay,</v>

246
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.520
<v 0>I actually address my feelings in the moment.
You know,</v>

247
00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:27.300
I was fucking one of those people brutally.
Like three days later I'd be like,

248
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.800
Hey,
wait a minute.

249
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.700
That person took advantage of me or that person was being rude.

250
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:35.800
I should have fucking said something.
Right.
Um,

251
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.530
this fucking wave of anger came up and,
uh,
I just,
you know,

252
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.170
handle it classically like the German Irish guy.
I am,

253
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.280
I didn't communicate anything.
I just stood up.
I walked over,

254
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.560
I started putting my jacket on and all that.

255
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.640
Now of course she's fucking know and you John Leave doing all that shit,

256
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.540
you know what I mean?
And all you want to do is the,
you know,

257
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:59.750
the swim move than a defensive lineman does.
You know,

258
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.500
you fucking pushed to the side and then you fucking bring your arm up and over.

259
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:05.090
That's what I wanted to do.
So of course,

260
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.580
now I'm walking towards the door and she does what all,

261
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:09.770
what every fucking woman does in that moment.

262
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:14.360
She's blocking the door and now she's crying.
She's crying,
you know?

263
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.060
It's like,
what are you crying about after everything you just said to me?

264
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:20.060
I'm holding it together pretty fucking good here.
So she's crying.

265
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.650
Now she's between the door and I say,
you know,
I want to leave.

266
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.820
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
No,
but look,
you know,
and then that,

267
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:31.580
then that said awful thing.
They stand in their whole,

268
00:15:31.581 --> 00:15:35.780
none of the fucking door jam and you can't put your hands on them or else you're

269
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:38.360
going to go to fucking jail.
Even if you're just trying to remove.
It's so weird.

270
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.570
You know what I mean?
It's like you're a human being.

271
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.020
You want to leave the room that you're in.
You're in a free country.

272
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.280
There's another human being prevented you from doing it there.

273
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.640
They're holding you there against your fucking wheel,
but they're a fucking lake,

274
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.220
<v 4>so</v>

275
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.760
<v 0>it's totally fine.
So what are you do</v>

276
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.570
you just have to sit there and not looking them in the eye?

277
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.840
Just staring at the fucking door.
Like I'm fucking leaving.

278
00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:09.520
You can stand here as long as you want.
I am going to fucking leave.
Right,

279
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.390
Ms. Brewer the key.
You can't,
you can't put your hands on and be,

280
00:16:13.391 --> 00:16:16.660
can't even try to like,
you know,
with the outside of your arms.
So to try to,

281
00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:21.570
you know,
kind of shoehorn your way past them.
Um,

282
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.760
cause then they start flailing around like deliberately trying to get themselves

283
00:16:24.761 --> 00:16:26.140
hurt during the altercation.

284
00:16:26.141 --> 00:16:29.650
So then you'll feel bad and then you won't fucking leave their fucking lunatics.

285
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.490
I want to leave.
Right.
Look at me.
It's still bugs me.

286
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.250
So you know what?
I swear to God,
you know,

287
00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:39.340
I've always wanted to come up with something that you could sell for 1995 late

288
00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:41.770
at night and all these mouth breathing fucking morons.

289
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.670
They think Trump's going to make the fucking planet great again or fucking or

290
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.090
United States great again and all these fucking dumb bras.

291
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:50.440
I thought that because Hillary also had a vagina,

292
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.220
that somehow their life was going to improve those fucking morons.
Right.

293
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.600
And is yet another day of disappointment has gone past and they fill themselves

294
00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:02.380
up with buying absolute shit for 1995 I've always thought,

295
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.940
how can I take advantage of these people for $20 a pop?
And I,
you know,

296
00:17:06.941 --> 00:17:10.090
every time I've come up with something I find out somebody else has already

297
00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:13.330
invented it.
Like I came up with this fucking thing that you know,

298
00:17:13.331 --> 00:17:15.550
you stick between the car seat and the console,

299
00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:18.280
so every time you drop something it doesn't go between the seats somewhat

300
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:22.390
already came up with that.
Right.
That was the only thing I ever came up with.

301
00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:23.500
But somebody already came up with it.

302
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.770
So it'd be great if for like 1995 you could come up with a device that gets the

303
00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:36.550
woman away from the fucking door so you can fucking leave when they're blocking.

304
00:17:36.551 --> 00:17:37.540
It would,

305
00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:42.541
that does not involve like hurting them or her at any point.

306
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.520
Also being able to say that you put your hands on,
so I figured there's like,

307
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.120
I dunno,

308
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.020
I don't what you have like you have like giant fucking like these nerf hands.

309
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.490
Okay.
And you just put them on either side of her,
right.

310
00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.620
Then once you stick them on and they just stick on,
like,

311
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:04.500
you know when they have like those plastic explosives that you just slap on the

312
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.990
side of a tank.
It's like once they're on you,
they're fucking on you.

313
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.560
You're going to owe or a new shirt.
All right.
But at the end of the day,

314
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.180
that's worth,
worth the fucking price of just getting the fuck out of there.
Okay.

315
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.820
So you put them on either side of her and then you have,
you know,

316
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:22.821
those blood pressure pumps as a youth [inaudible] now she can't fucking move,

317
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.710
you know,
and then then you,
you,
you got an inflatable be bay,
right?

318
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.580
And then you just guide her over.
You put it down on the fucking bean bag,

319
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.690
you open the door and then you fucking bring the blood pressure pump just to the

320
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:37.680
outside of the door.

321
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.870
You close the door and right as you're about way to close it,
you release it,

322
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.150
see closed the door,
and then you're fucking right to your car,
right?

323
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.020
You know that thing where you're fucking running any,

324
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.870
if you feel lightheaded and shit and she's going to become running down the hall

325
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:53.700
after you announced,
like you're in a horror movie,

326
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.880
you're trying to get your keys out and he or she fucking comes,

327
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.370
you get in the fucking car.

328
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.440
Hopefully you get the car door close before that fucking lunatic comes up to

329
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:06.250
stick her fucking Armand.
You close the door,
you lock it,

330
00:19:06.251 --> 00:19:07.320
and then you know what she's gonna do.

331
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.310
She's gonna stand behind your fucking car.

332
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.780
Then all you do is you just start the car up,
right,
and then,

333
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.500
and you're revved the fucking engine.
Get those admissions in her face.

334
00:19:18.501 --> 00:19:19.650
You listen to some tunes.

335
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.770
Eventually she's going to have to go to the bathroom and who knows?

336
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.000
Maybe an hour later,
maybe a fucking hour later,
you know,

337
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:28.020
you get the fuck out of there,

338
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.943
<v 3>right?</v>

339
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:35.480
<v 0>1995 I can put that in an infomercial,
not even infomercial.</v>

340
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:40.340
That's too much money.
I can do that in a fucking 32nd spot,
right?

341
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.660
Fellas?

342
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.190
Have you ever wanted to lead your girlfriend's apartment but she won't let you?

343
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.570
What do you do?
You've tried moving her out of the way,
right?
She yells,

344
00:19:50.571 --> 00:19:54.680
fucking rape that the cops coming and fucking tackle you and showing you in a

345
00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:59.260
cell with a fucking giant cell mate looking at you like he's going to bang you

346
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.170
in the ass.
Right?

347
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.020
That's the first six seconds of the commercial and I think you guys can do the

348
00:20:03.021 --> 00:20:07.430
rest of it.
Maybe that's a reason to have a four wheel drive vehicle,

349
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:10.940
so when she's like a standing behind you,
you can't back out.

350
00:20:10.941 --> 00:20:14.570
You just put it in drive,
go right up and over a curb.
I don't know.

351
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.860
I guess what I'm really getting at here is I hope you guys all enjoyed your

352
00:20:18.861 --> 00:20:22.250
holidays,
your nice fucking days off here.

353
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.510
You know,
it's spent so long since I've had a day job yet.

354
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.150
Do you guys have to go back to work today?
That's sucks man.

355
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.350
You know the day after Christmas,
you right back.
And then,
let's see,
what is it?

356
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.760
New Year's Day is what?
It's Sunday.

357
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.280
Yeah.
News days.
Sunday.
But then they played the bowl games on Monday.

358
00:20:43.281 --> 00:20:47.680
So maybe next weekend you get the fucking three day weekend.
I have no idea.

359
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.310
All I can say is fuck you.
2016.

360
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.600
Glad this year's over me.
And um,
you know,

361
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.700
a while ago when they came up with the College Football playoff,

362
00:20:58.701 --> 00:20:59.800
somebody play off.

363
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.560
Somebody asked me to comment on it and I was too fucking busy editing the God

364
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.730
damn show.
I never really looked at it.
Um,

365
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.340
and it just dawned on me that Ohio state is in,
in Penn state is out.

366
00:21:13.341 --> 00:21:14.780
How the fuck does that work?

367
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:16.970
<v 1>Okay,</v>

368
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.710
<v 0>somebody please explain that to me.</v>

369
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.960
<v 0>Penn State won the big 10 championship and they beat Ohio state.</v>

371
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.640
Penn state's in the fucking Rosebowl and Ohio State's in the playoff.

372
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.880
And I've got a friend of mine is a buckeyes fan and he's bitching

373
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.460
<v 5>but Alabama schedule</v>

374
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.640
<v 0>fucking he's wine.
It's like,
dude,
you should even be in there.
I,</v>

375
00:21:41.641 --> 00:21:43.290
Allstate should not fucking be in there.

376
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.670
That makes no fucking sense whatsoever and all you fucking concert,

377
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:52.600
we're going to go,
well Alabama had a real easy schedule.
SCC suck this year.

378
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.070
So what SCC was the,

379
00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:00.550
the whole fucking year was basically playing a national championship game like

380
00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:04.960
fucking two,
three times.
They,
the,
the,
the conference was that good for 10 years?

381
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.700
Alabama had to fight through all of that.
So one time they get an easy year.

382
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:15.900
Um,
anyways,
having said that,
I'm still rooting against them because you have to,

383
00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:18.510
they're so fucking good.
It's fun.
It's fun.

384
00:22:18.511 --> 00:22:20.130
And I told you my favorite thing in sports,

385
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.120
Alabama down at the half and then Nick Saban has to talk to one of those

386
00:22:24.121 --> 00:22:27.830
sideline reporter women,
you know,
he,

387
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.840
all he wants to do is fucking slam some lockers.

388
00:22:30.841 --> 00:22:34.020
It's chew out as Punter Asub Shit.
And he's got to sit there.

389
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.050
Like I'm telling you,
if anything is going to put that guy in an early grave,

390
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:41.970
it's that fucking interview we asked to do.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,
I don't,

391
00:22:41.971 --> 00:22:45.060
I mean I'm not like Anti Ohio state,
but that does,

392
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.190
that does not seem fair to me at all.

393
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.720
How does a team that didn't win the big tent,

394
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:54.180
it didn't even when they're fucking conference championship is in the final
four.

395
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.330
<v 0>It's all bullshit.
It's all fucking money.
It's all money I owe.</v>

397
00:23:00.331 --> 00:23:01.980
State is going to get better ratings.

398
00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:05.040
I bet it's going to give him better ratings than fucking Penn state.

399
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.270
Other than that,
it makes no fucking sense on paper.
You know,

400
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.030
and I loved those kids that are going to sit out their bowl game,

401
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.133
<v 5>but he's just so good.</v>

402
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.680
<v 0>Sports talk radio guys.
It's like,
dude,
it's fucking slave labor.</v>

403
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.190
Remember that dude on Ohio state played that fucking Penn state,
uh,

404
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.240
was a willing to [inaudible] gay.
He got his fucking knee blown out for free.

405
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.030
Cost him a career in the NFL.
If you didn't have such a great fucking agent,
um,

406
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.860
yeah.
Fuck you.
You're going to sell,
sell a Jersey with the kid's name on it.

407
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.510
You're gonna make millions more.

408
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:46.410
The fucking players are selling out 100,000 seat stadium and don't get a fucking

409
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.430
dime.
Figure that one out.

410
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:55.070
All those players throughout the fucking century of the damn team that have

411
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:59.450
created the excitement gone out.
They're blown out their knees,

412
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:03.350
got concussions,
got paralyzed,
died early.
Fucking deaths.

413
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:06.150
Do not get one dime.
Fuck you and your bowl game.

414
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.060
They got to start giving these kids money,
man.
It's fucking brutal.
It's brutal.

415
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.720
And I love all the fucking nerds that actually go to class and they get mad at

416
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:17.210
the athletes because they don't show up.
It's like,
Hey,
fuck head.

417
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.520
If it wasn't for that kid out there,
you would,

418
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:22.520
you would have a class in a tent right now.
You know?

419
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.030
What do you think paid for this?
This fucking biology classroom?

420
00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:27.893
<v 2>Huh?</v>

421
00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.920
<v 0>People showing 100,000 people showing up to look at you.</v>

422
00:24:31.921 --> 00:24:36.750
Look through a fucking microscope.
A tent.
All right?
You don't have a sexy job.

423
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.340
Deal with it.
Right?
I don't get it.
Having said that,

424
00:24:41.341 --> 00:24:46.290
I'm still gonna Watch and um,
I dunno,

425
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.910
I like Clemson too,
but,
uh,
I don't know.
I'm kind of a big 10 guy too.

426
00:24:50.911 --> 00:24:53.130
I probably still root for house state,
but that,
that's so funny.

427
00:24:53.131 --> 00:24:56.070
It doesn't make any fucking sense.
I mean,

428
00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:59.640
there's always going to be a reason to complain because football's such a

429
00:24:59.641 --> 00:25:02.550
violent game that they can't have like march madness.

430
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.470
They just can't be too many fucking games and too many kids get hurt,
right.

431
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.840
So
every year someone's going to get mad and,
uh,

432
00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:16.620
so I usually blow it off,
but this year Penn State got fucked.

433
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:22.050
You know,
I mean,
maybe it's leftover sin Dusky Shit.
You know what I mean?

434
00:25:22.051 --> 00:25:23.670
Like not enough time has gone by.

435
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.070
Just going to pause here to listen to all the Penn state fans go la.

436
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.193
<v 2>Okay.</v>

437
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.010
<v 0>You know,
it's funny.</v>

438
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:38.010
Is the fucking Tom Brady deflate gate story lasted longer than that Sen Dusky

439
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.230
Shit.
And that's the world that we live in.
Um,

440
00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:45.530
<v 2>okay.</v>

441
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.300
<v 0>All right.
Let's get to some of the questions here for this week,
shall we?
Um,</v>

442
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.870
oh,
how about the fucking Celtics man?
That's Celtics Knicks game was great.

443
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:57.980
The NBA too,
by the way,
Bravo for saying,
all right NFL,

444
00:25:57.981 --> 00:26:00.110
you get thanksgiving,
we get Christmas.

445
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.920
They actually muscled the NFL out of position on a football Sunday to the point

446
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:10.910
that all the fucking games are on Saturday,
Saturday.

447
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.030
Well there any NFL games yesterday,
I didn't even look.

448
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.030
The NBA Games was so fucking great.
I missed the first one.

449
00:26:17.031 --> 00:26:21.440
I watched the Celtics and Nick's great fucking game.
Then we almost blew it.

450
00:26:21.441 --> 00:26:26.441
And here's the funny thing is Michael Rappaport still owes me dinner from the

451
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:29.450
NBA finals and that cause he's a cheat motherfucker or anything.

452
00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:31.130
It's because we're both fucking busy and we just,

453
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:33.890
we run into each other like once every six months.
Self,

454
00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:38.540
Celtics to play in Nick's on Christmas Day.
And I saw,
I texted him,
I said,

455
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:43.100
Hey Mike,
you want to go double enough?
I'll take the Celtics straight up.

456
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.430
And he goes,
absolutely.
And then he goes,
wait egos.
So if,

457
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.390
if I lose,
do I owe you two dinners?
I go,
no,

458
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.410
you owe me breakfast.
You owe me dinner and now you owe me breakfast.

459
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.540
And then we'll bet on the Superbowl and if I win,
you know,
if you,
if you win,

460
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:02.940
you don't owe me shit.
And if I win,
you owe me breakfast,
lunch,

461
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:04.530
and dinner and you're gonna fucking take me out.

462
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:08.490
We're going to do a youtube video of you taking me out on the town for the

463
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:13.410
entire fucking day.
And uh,
so he said,
all right,
so he's in.

464
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.600
So what I'm hoping is that there's going to be a patriots giant fucking the

465
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:21.440
trilogy.
And,
uh,

466
00:27:21.441 --> 00:27:24.660
of course I'm taking my patriots and I'm hoping this is the year that our

467
00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:27.270
defense does it let Tom Brady down.

468
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.870
Cause the first two times we played the giants,

469
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.530
He drove them at the Patriots down the field for the go ahead score.

470
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:39.710
Both times he is six foot six and super bowls when it is counted right.

471
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.360
The time with Donovan McNabb fucking throws up Nilo Donald throws a pic,

472
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.770
Peyton manning throws a pick six.
Tom Brady has manned up all six.

473
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:57.750
He's gone six.
Oh,
unfortunately his defense has gone forward to,

474
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.640
um,
so I want to see that rematch.

475
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.220
And,
um,
of course I'm going to take the Patriots and I,
then I texted him,

476
00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:13.200
I said,
okay,
so the Patriots and giants play each other.
What's going to happen?

477
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.380
Are the Patriots going to go oh and three.

478
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:17.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

479
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.420
<v 0>Oh,
the giant is going to go into the giants.
Gonna go three now.</v>

480
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

481
00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.350
<v 0>Against the Patriots.</v>

482
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.920
Or is Michael Rappaport going to go all in three against the menu?

483
00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:32.620
So hopefully that's going to happen.
You know,

484
00:28:32.621 --> 00:28:34.570
I want the Patriots to play.
We'd go back to super.

485
00:28:34.571 --> 00:28:37.660
We have to play the fucking charts.
I don't give a fuck about Seattle.

486
00:28:37.661 --> 00:28:39.070
We already played then we already beat him.

487
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.860
I don't give a fuck about anybody else.
We gotta we gotta go back.

488
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.050
You got to do it.
You know,
I've talked to some fucking patriots fans.
They'll go,

489
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:49.370
oh my God,
that makes me sick to my stomach.
So what are you gonna do?

490
00:28:49.371 --> 00:28:52.570
You're going to quit now you gonna put your Paul Revere had between your fucking

491
00:28:52.571 --> 00:28:57.220
legs and go home.
You know,
I think the biggest thing this year is as their coach,

492
00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.640
even though the coach is doing like a good job and everything,
but you know,

493
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.860
I dunno,
I just don't,
this is so stupid.
I just look at a coach,

494
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.450
I judge a book by its cover and I just look at that guy and I'm just like,
yeah,

495
00:29:10.451 --> 00:29:14.500
you know,
I'm not feeling,
I'm not feeling this guy.
This guy just looks like a,

496
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.440
it looks like a diehard giant's fan.
That's what he looks like.

497
00:29:17.441 --> 00:29:21.460
He does not look like a uh,
a head coach.

498
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.950
Um,
so anyways,
we shall see.
And I told you I'm not buying into,
I don't buy,

499
00:29:26.951 --> 00:29:30.850
don't buy.
I'm,
I'm not,
I don't believe in the cowboys.
I don't like to coach.

500
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.520
I look at him,
I'm like,
I do not lie.
Just don't like that guy.

501
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.560
Not like personally don't like him.

502
00:29:35.561 --> 00:29:40.420
I just look at him and he just doesn't look at your head coach
like a head coach.

503
00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.550
You got to look at them.
You got to be like,
Oh man,

504
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:44.560
I would not want to get yelled at by that guy.

505
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.190
I know you guys to think of what about Pete Carroll?

506
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:51.530
Pete Carroll looks like he's going to Bible study.
Yeah,
but if you look into he,

507
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.000
he,
Carol has shark eyes.
Okay.

508
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.450
I'm telling you that fucking guy,
you know,

509
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.460
I'm not trying to put rumors out there,

510
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:05.140
but if that guy had like a dead hooker in his past,
okay.
Or at least,
you know,

511
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:08.920
one that lost consciousness and he brought her around,
you know,

512
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.180
it would not surprise me.

513
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.950
That is so fucked up to say,
I'm sure he's a hell of a guy.
All right,
let's get,

514
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:20.410

My goddamn throwing.

598
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.880
You want to happen.
So I woke up this morning,
but do we do dude,

599
00:35:03.881 --> 00:35:08.881
and I just started doing the podcast because I got do a bunch of shit today as

600
00:35:09.311 --> 00:35:11.560
always.
As always.
Uh,

601
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.850
hey Billy Balden Billy bald.
Dan,
do you get it?

602
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.810
Billy balding business.
Billy Bald.
Dan Is Brava.

603
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.730
I heard you ranting about how New England keeps offloading defense defending

604
00:35:24.731 --> 00:35:26.320
players.
You're half right.

605
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.660
But this year is a big year for salary cap dot.
What do you mean?
I'm half right.

606
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.320
Name one person that has finished their fucking career with the Patriots on the

607
00:35:37.321 --> 00:35:40.940
defensive side since fucking,
uh,

608
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.460
Teddy Bruschi or fucking a Willie McGinest.

609
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.020
We never keep them.
I'm not half right dude.

610
00:35:50.021 --> 00:35:55.000
Richard Seymour lawyer Malloy Thai law,
uh,
who's a big fucking,

611
00:35:55.001 --> 00:35:57.220
um,
oh my God,

612
00:35:57.221 --> 00:36:00.160
I can't believe I forgot his fucking name cause they're only with us for a few

613
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.770
years.
Who is the Big Fat Guy?
Our,
our,
our nose tackle.
He's God.

614
00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.030
I don't know.
Anyway,
so you said you're half right.
Dante,
hightower,

615
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.220
Malcolm Butler,
a bolt in their mid twenties and in contracts years.

616
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.180
Expect both of them to get big contracts in the off season.

617
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:21.070
I don't expect that.
I don't expect that at all.
Maybe one of them will.

618
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.030
So what you're saying is I'm half right.
You're saying expect them.

619
00:36:25.031 --> 00:36:28.300
So on your forecast,
I'm telling you what has happened.

620
00:36:28.301 --> 00:36:32.620
You're saying on your forecast you what you are you what you are projecting that

621
00:36:32.621 --> 00:36:33.910
that's,
that's one of your points.
Okay.

622
00:36:33.911 --> 00:36:36.670
Your first point is out the fucking window.
All right.

623
00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.050
That's science fiction there.
Okay.

624
00:36:38.051 --> 00:36:41.590
Expect to see both of them get big contracts and I've seen Patrick Chung,

625
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.720
the strong safety is 30 now and we have a great young backup and Landon Collins

626
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.910
who was also in a contract year.
Okay.

627
00:36:48.911 --> 00:36:53.530
So expect Patrick Chung to get the fucking evo cause he's 30 and now it would

628
00:36:53.531 --> 00:36:55.930
probably be like,
Hey I'm a veteran of play in this league.

629
00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:58.390
I've demonstrated that I can do that job and that's when they go,

630
00:36:58.391 --> 00:36:59.500
okay fucking see you later.

631
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.490
Finally the pro bowl free safety,

632
00:37:03.491 --> 00:37:07.840
Devin McCourty is getting top dollar dollar.
So it isn't just the offense.

633
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.950
Okay.
So in all of that shit you just said,

634
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.520
you only named one guy who's getting top dollar.

635
00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.630
Okay.
Everything else was projecting shit.

636
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:20.860
<v 3>Okay.</v>

637
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.693
<v 0>Right.</v>

638
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.930
Hope that brings some clarity to Billy super bowls.

639
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.800
Pretrade deadline move sending Jamie Collins,

640
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.300
another middle linebacker entering a contract here who was underperforming

641
00:37:34.301 --> 00:37:38.740
compared to hightower.
Thanks for a great podcast.
Underperforming.

642
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.790
All right.
What,
well,
like how you,
I like how you ignored uh,
uh,

643
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.980
Chandler Jones who's having a fucking pro bowl year with Arizona.

644
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.870
Um,
you basically told me that Devin McCourty is getting paid.

645
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.910
That's basically what you told me.
And um,

646
00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.530
they've always paid guys who were in their mid twenties.

647
00:37:59.531 --> 00:38:03.850
What I'm talking about is that next contract,
that next one.
They're like,
yeah,

648
00:38:03.851 --> 00:38:07.810
get the fuck Outta here.
You Audio Patrick Chung.

649
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:13.050
Get the fuck Outta here.
All right.
Um,
here we go.

650
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.850
I mean,
look,
as much as I'm complaining it is working,

651
00:38:15.851 --> 00:38:20.851
but it does get frustrating to see these guys that she shut down this side of

652
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:25.690
the field and every couple of years we get rid of that guy.
And um,

653
00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.610
like I always feel like,
you know what,
I always feel like our defense,
you know,

654
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:36.970
since the McGuinness frable and a teddy Bruschi years,

655
00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:41.410
I always feel like it goes in,
it's like my pie,
it looks like it's done,

656
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:45.910
but inside it's still soupy,
you know?
So when we go up against the giants,

657
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:49.030
I just feel like we don't know.
Those two times we went up again,

658
00:38:49.031 --> 00:38:53.260
we didn't match up well against them.
They had a monster defense,

659
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:57.540
you know,
we're coming in there.
You know,
we had Leanna,

660
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.080
I just,
I dunno,
I love I,
that's why I love the giants.

661
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.510
I love the Chinese because they always have a great fucking defense.

662
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.970
I always have a great fucking defense.
I that,
you know,

663
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.640
that's why I like the Steelers.
Back in the day,
they doomsday defense,

664
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:11.980
the cow was,
you've got to love those teams.
You know,

665
00:39:11.981 --> 00:39:15.460
cause then you're on offense can just be like good and you're going to win the

666
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:19.360
fucking game.
That's how s fucking now Mark Sanchez,
everybody who asks,

667
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.330
they started calling him Sanchez.
They're fucking defense was great.

668
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.160
Then they lost everybody and all of a sudden,
you know,

669
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.870
uh,
USC boy there didn't,

670
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.920
couldn't just manage the game.

671
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.970
He had any had to play from behind.
And he's like,
Eh,
Eh,
where did it go?

672
00:39:36.971 --> 00:39:37.421
Where did it go?

673
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:42.130
And he runs right in the fucking ass of his linemen and got a concussion.
Well,

674
00:39:42.131 --> 00:39:45.520
you would've got a concussion.
No,
I probably didn't get a concussion.

675
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:49.840
That guy probably did too many squats as acid.
Probably like an elbow.
Alright.

676
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.650
Podcasts inspired girlfriend to quit job that was making her miserable.

677
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.430
Oh Jesus Christ.
There should be on the Oprah Winfrey network.
Are we,

678
00:39:57.431 --> 00:40:00.160
are we actually going to have like a feel good fucking story here?

679
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.040
Fuck is going on with these blinds.
Open the blinds.
Okay,

680
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.650
what did we get here?
40 minutes in?
Okay.

681
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:12.430
Somebody's got to stretch this shit and do another 20 minutes to ignorance.
Okay.

682
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.870
Well,
Bill,
you've been doing great for the first 40 minutes.
All right.

683
00:40:16.871 --> 00:40:20.510
Podcast inspired girlfriend quit job that was making her miserable.
Hey,
Billy.

684
00:40:20.511 --> 00:40:22.540
Bill,
a chick.
Um,

685
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.900
my girlfriend and I love the podcast and we listened to it together and whenever

686
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:28.150
we're on a long road trip,
a few months ago,

687
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.510
we put on your interview with Joe Rogan.
Uh,

688
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:35.530
when you guys started talking about jobs,
you hate it and how you knew,
uh,

689
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.540
and how you had to,
to know when to walk.
My girlfriends started crying.

690
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:45.760
Oh,
Jesus.
Up to that point,
I knew that she had issues with their job,

691
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:50.650
but had no idea that our company was putting it through so much grief.
Um,

692
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.100
so much grief that it was making her absolutely miserable deep down inside.

693
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:55.630
Once you heard the interview,

694
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.680
it convinced and inspired her to take action as quickly as possible to seek new

695
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:02.800
employment.
Good for her.
Yeah.

696
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:06.190
And that's a great habit to get into and you do it when you fucking young

697
00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:10.120
because you don't have any kids.
No wife,
no husband,
no mortgage.

698
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.400
That's when you fucking make you moves.

699
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.140
I'm not to say you can't do it after that,
but it's obviously um,

700
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.420
you know,
there's,
there's no reason not to do it when you're young.
Okay.

701
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:26.950
Now she's on the right track for a really great job and the possibilities of a

702
00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:30.910
permanent hire with a really good companies seem to be in the works of seem to

703
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:32.080
be in the works.
Knock on wood,

704
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.780
I would like to thank you Mister Rogan for not only providing us with great

705
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:40.781
entertainment but also in inadvertently helping out someone I truly love and

706
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:43.100
care about to seek a positive work environment.
Dude,

707
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:44.890
is there going to be anything I could make fun of him.
This,

708
00:41:44.891 --> 00:41:47.990
this is just like a nice letter.
She is also,

709
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:52.970
she is already in better spirits than ever before and it's in part thanks to
you.

710
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:56.390
Hope to see you come through the Carolina's next time around.

711
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:58.820
Thanks again and have a wonderful holiday.
Well that's great.

712
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.470
All I can do is reiterate.
I can't even remember what the fuck I said,
but yeah.

713
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.180
Um,
you know,
I had a friend of mine that was working for,

714
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.180
uh,
was working for the Nestle company.

715
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:13.431
I think it was Nestle.

716
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:17.300
It's one of those fucking corporations and they will running this person ragged.

717
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.100
And I literally watched this person go from a positive person to somebody that I

718
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:27.101
started to avoid his phone calls because like it was getting so fucking

719
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:31.990
negative.
And then,
uh,
one day this person just said,

720
00:42:31.991 --> 00:42:32.920
fuck this,

721
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:38.850
quit and actually started working for like a nonprofit and was happy as fucking

722
00:42:38.921 --> 00:42:43.921
hell and is now back in the corporate world at a company that he fucking loves

723
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.870
in.
Like,
you have to fucking do that,
man.
You don't,

724
00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.820
if that whole fucking fear of like,
you know,

725
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.100
how am I going to pay for Shit?

726
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:58.420
We'll keep you in these bad relationships with these horrific fucking companies.

727
00:42:58.421 --> 00:43:02.590
Right.
Um,
but what she had,
you have to always be willing

728
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.220
to sacrifice for your own happiness.

729
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:11.200
And if that involves downsizing your fucking life and just getting,

730
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:14.290
just looking at all this shit on your shelves and all of this stuff that you

731
00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:18.180
fucking have,
it'd be like,
how much of this shit do I even fucking need?

732
00:43:18.181 --> 00:43:20.500
Cause I'm sitting here,
you know,

733
00:43:20.501 --> 00:43:23.740
in our guest room where I have all my drum videos,
my magazines,

734
00:43:23.741 --> 00:43:27.190
all these fucking books,
they've just sat on the shelf for fucking years.

735
00:43:27.191 --> 00:43:30.670
Like if you literally took everything off of this fucking shells,

736
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:35.890
okay.
Other than the sentimental value of a few fucking things,
I wouldn't even,

737
00:43:35.891 --> 00:43:37.030
you can empty all the fucking,

738
00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:41.800
those little cabinets if you emptied all of it other than when I walked in and I

739
00:43:41.801 --> 00:43:46.360
didn't see it,
I wouldn't miss any of it.
Um,

740
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:53.920
except for I have the 1970,
is it 1972.

741
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:57.850
It's the most expensive years of football cards.
Um,

742
00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:02.640
I have the complete set that I would miss,
that I would miss.

743
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.920
It was a couple other things I got up there.
But other than that,
I said,

744
00:44:05.921 --> 00:44:08.080
you know what,
I'm,
you know what?
I'm going to get rid of all that fucking shit.

745
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.720
But a downsize my fuck.
I'm saying you can do that.

746
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:15.040
Think about when you first fucking,
you know,
moved out of your house.

747
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:18.730
What did you have?
You had the clothes on your back,
couple of piece of shit,

748
00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.820
things of furniture,
right?
And then other than that,

749
00:44:21.821 --> 00:44:24.500
just over the years you get subscriptions to magazines.

750
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:27.400
Just say they just start collecting shit.
People give you stuff,

751
00:44:27.401 --> 00:44:31.390
you go and fucking trips and you buy shot glasses and then all of a sudden what

752
00:44:31.391 --> 00:44:36.360
you really yet your house is just this giant storage shed for a bunch of shit

753
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:40.200
that you don't lead.
Eat your apartment becomes the same way.
So

754
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.150
if you downsize all of that to get out of a fucking job,

755
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:49.620
you don't want to be in and you reduce your fucking overhead in the meantime,

756
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:52.800
you can actually make less.
You know,

757
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.300
there's all different ways to get out of the job,
starts spending less,

758
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:02.301
saving up fucking money so you can quit your job and live for for months without

759
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:06.060
having to fuck at work or whatever.
Or making a little bit less money.

760
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.111
In the meantime,

761
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:10.680
just get rid of a bunch of shit that you don't even fucking need.
Um,

762
00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.800
I got to do that with the baby coming any fucking day now I gotta uh,

763
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.410
I gotta get rid of a bunch of shit cause God knows she's going to have a bunch

764
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:22.630
of shit too,
right?
Uh,

765
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:26.730
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
here we go.
Let's fucking,
let's,

766
00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:31.380
let's plow ahead here.
A return.
Gifts.
All right,
dear bill,

767
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:35.130
I got to get into a debate with my fiance.
I got into a debate with my fiance.

768
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:38.490
She seems to think it's rude.
I don't wanna be rude.

769
00:45:38.491 --> 00:45:43.050
It seems to be rude to ask someone for a gift receipt for a gift they did not

770
00:45:43.051 --> 00:45:43.884
like.

771
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:46.080
<v 6>MMM.</v>

772
00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.021
<v 0>I told her that it,</v>

773
00:45:47.021 --> 00:45:51.430
it'd be worse to keep the gift and never use it then to return for a better size

774
00:45:51.431 --> 00:45:52.960
of something different altogether.

775
00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.240
I take you for the type of guy to just say thank you and throw it out if you

776
00:45:58.241 --> 00:46:02.350
don't like it.
Good call,
man.
I actually,
if I don't like something,

777
00:46:02.351 --> 00:46:06.220
I would never die.
I just don't do that.
I just,
uh,
I take it down to goodwill.

778
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.140
Um,
I got a jacket from my aunt that I don't like and doesn't fit.

779
00:46:11.141 --> 00:46:16.141
She thinks I should just exchange it for a proper size and call it a day.

780
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:19.600
I know for a fact that my aunt wouldn't be offended because we're close enough

781
00:46:19.601 --> 00:46:23.800
that I can tell her that thoughts on this,
you know.

782
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.080
<v 6>Okay.</v>

783
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.120
<v 0>This is one that I,
it's up to you.</v>

784
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:32.670
I think it's a good exercise to tell somebody what you're really feeling,

785
00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.950
uh,
at the price of their feelings.

786
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.590
I just don't know if it's with a Christmas gift.

787
00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:39.980
<v 6>MMM.</v>

788
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.670
<v 0>I think you could do it once to somebody,
but if next year,</v>

789
00:46:43.671 --> 00:46:48.350
if they come back with something ugly again,
then you're just saying,

790
00:46:48.351 --> 00:46:51.800
you know,
you have bad tastes.
But,
uh,

791
00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.540
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

792
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.270
I don't think there's anything wrong with it.
And,
uh,
if they look,

793
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:01.670
I gotta be honest with you.
If I got somebody a fucking gift right now,

794
00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:05.420
if they didn't start screaming at me and make me sit down,
like if I ever gotten,

795
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.670
if I ever get my wife a gift,
she was like,
you know,
I don't like this.

796
00:47:07.671 --> 00:47:10.700
Can I exchange?
It would be I can't fuck.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Here's the receipt.

797
00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:14.290
Have fun going to those crowded malls.
I'm done.
I,

798
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.170
I've fulfilled my end of the,

799
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.510
the verbal contractual agreement that we have that I will buy you a Christmas

800
00:47:20.511 --> 00:47:23.600
gift.
But you know,
when you go to return the fucking thing,
I mean,
that's on you.

801
00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.140
You can go back in there with all those fucking animals again.
I'm not doing it.

802
00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:32.260
Um,
yeah,
I don't think there's wrong with it.
I think that that's,

803
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:36.100
maybe that's a preference thing.
You know,
if you,
if you want to fucking,

804
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.330
<v 3>okay,</v>

805
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.590
<v 0>do you want to go that route?
You know,
God bless you.
You go that fucking route.</v>

806
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:46.210
If you don't,
I respect that too.
Um,
all right.

807
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.090
I slapped my sister when Christmas Eve.
I don't believe this.

808
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:53.020
I don't believe this at all.
Dear Billy Bitch tits.
I'm bitch tits.

809
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:56.080
And you slept a woman.
Um,
hey Billy.

810
00:47:56.081 --> 00:48:00.370
Recently my family celebrated my dad's birthday,
which is on Christmas Eve.

811
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:04.780
And like every year we went to a local Mexican restaurant.

812
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.320
My mother bought him a very expensive bottle of Middleton triple distilled Irish

813
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:15.670
whiskey.
Never heard of that ship.
A hope I said it right,

814
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:20.740
which we proceed to drink once we returned to my parents house.
All right,

815
00:48:20.741 --> 00:48:22.630
how many of you are on this bottle?

816
00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.150
And there's a woman's slapped in the end of this?
Jesus Christ.

817
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:28.870
This is like a fucking country music video.
Once we were back,

818
00:48:28.871 --> 00:48:30.400
my sister who's 30,

819
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.990
asked if she could collect pictures of us as little kids,

820
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.890
she could make an album.
I see it.

821
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.920
I knew exactly where some great ones were of her as a baby and my mother's

822
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:44.650
drawer where she,
my mother had previously shown me.

823
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:46.900
Um,
you know,

824
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.320
I don't know what's going to happen in this thing or if it's even a true story.

825
00:48:50.321 --> 00:48:53.410
But I'm already saying at some point somebody should have said fair enough

826
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.810
before somebody gets slapped or key goes,

827
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:59.950
my sister has a different father than I and from what I gather,

828
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.980
her dad was a not so great guy and my mother doesn't seem to have any fun

829
00:49:05.441 --> 00:49:06.970
memories of that relationship.

830
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:08.970
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

831
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:10.350
<v 0>Um,
okay.</v>

832
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.680
I presented the pictures to her expecting her to have either seen them before or

833
00:49:16.951 --> 00:49:19.110
to be thrilled to be seeing them for the first time.

834
00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.920
The pictures were of her and her father with my mother's family.

835
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:28.700
Um,
I'm getting lost here.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.

836
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.130
You guys have the same mom but different dads.
Okay.
Also,

837
00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:34.110
her birth certificate was in the certificate was in the envelope,

838
00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:38.130
which she apparently,
which apparently she had never seen.
She's 30.

839
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:43.050
She never had a produce,
a birth certificate.
When she saw them,
she freaked out.

840
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.940
She began to berate my mother for never showing them to her in a full blown

841
00:49:47.941 --> 00:49:52.230
fight ensued.
Of course,
I was mortified.

842
00:49:52.231 --> 00:49:56.190
I had no idea this was going to happen.
Um,
I'm going to go out on a limb here,

843
00:49:56.191 --> 00:50:00.030
sir.
When I say at this moment,
this is not about you anymore.
Okay.
I mean,

844
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.110
she didn't have a good relationship with her dad.
This could be,
you know,

845
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:09.140
something that she needed or something that seems to be between her and her mom.

846
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.300
And if you're going to go third man in,
and that's a game,

847
00:50:12.301 --> 00:50:16.520
his conduct and I would say a fucking 10 games suspension at least.
Uh,

848
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:21.530
she said horribly hurtful things to my mother and tried to storm out once I

849
00:50:22.681 --> 00:50:26.760
stepped in and tried to stop her.
Oh Shit.
Now you're doing that thing,

850
00:50:26.761 --> 00:50:28.730
so need this product tow.
Fuck.

851
00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:32.120
I'd make a zillion dollar the male or female

852
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.690
person remover.

853
00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:35.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

854
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:39.320
<v 0>How ignorant am my then I never thought that a woman ever had to fucking try to</v>

855
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.010
get through the door with some fucking asshole guy,
Stan,

856
00:50:43.011 --> 00:50:46.890
my apology and all the ladies.
All right.
Once I stepped in and tried,
uh,

857
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.740
once I stepped in and tried to stop her,

858
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:52.910
she began to attack me and shout out everything that was wrong with me and my

859
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:57.500
life.
I defended myself yelling back all the fucked up shit she's done.

860
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.920
Um,
that's not defending yourself,
sir.

861
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:03.740
Which you did was you went to her emotional level,

862
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.330
which you should have done was just laid on the fucking ropes,
let her go,

863
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.050
and then afterwards she would have owed you an apology,
a.
Anyways,

864
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:15.170
he goes then with Mike,
this is,
this is why you don't go home for the holidays.

865
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.740
This shit always ends up happening.
Then with my mother and father there,

866
00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:24.200
she charged me and punched me square in the eye with this insane look on her

867
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:27.110
face while she wanted to leave and you weren't letting her.

868
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:32.570
I was trying to keep her at arms length and telling myself over and over don't

869
00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:33.404
hit her.

870
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.240
The final Straw came when with both my parents trying to hold her back.

871
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:41.030
She managed to kick me in the face with their boots on.

872
00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:46.970
Aren't you standing up?
How the fuck did she do that?
Oh,

873
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:49.120
they held her back and tech gave her leverage.
Her sister,

874
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:52.260
she like Anderson Silver and she just gave you that front up kick.

875
00:51:52.261 --> 00:51:54.680
The didn't see whatever the fuck you call it and MMA terms.

876
00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.040
Then I proceeded calmly and coolly to pick the exact moment when to reach in and

877
00:52:01.131 --> 00:52:05.480
give her an open palm slap right across the whole left side of her face.

878
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:09.170
You did that calmly and coolly.
Oh,
Jesus.

879
00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:12.950
She immediately stopped a tirade and went in her car to pout.

880
00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.040
Well,
I have dude.
He slapped her in the face.
I don't think she's pouting.

881
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.180
She later chilled out and fell asleep on the sofa.
Christmas being tomorrow.

882
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:24.020
I need your help.

883
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.400
Did I do the wrong thing and how can I keep things from being fucked up from

884
00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:31.250
here on out.
Thank you.
And Go fuck yourself.
Did you do the wrong thing?

885
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:35.570
You slapped a woman?
Yes.
I mean,
she's coming at you with a knife then.
Yeah,

886
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:37.610
you can go close fisted at that point.
But I mean,

887
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:44.150
all she was trying to do is leave.
Um,
here's the thing,
dude.
She had

888
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:50.560
a valid reaction to something that really hurt her.

889
00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:51.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

890
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:55.090
<v 0>In,
in her pain.
She said a bunch of mean things to her mom.</v>

891
00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:56.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

892
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.810
<v 0>All right.
Now she comes from a broken home.
I mean,</v>

893
00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:01.700
this shit's going to happen during the fucking holidays.

894
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.780
You're fucking drunk on whiskey.
You write you guys a few.
From what I can tell,

895
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.380
there's only two of you on that bottle,
maybe three or whatever,
but you know,

896
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.560
three,
four people killing a bottle of whiskey,
you're all going to be hammered.

897
00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.430
All right?
Um,
then she wanted to leave.

898
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:18.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

899
00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.780
<v 0>Now she's drunk and she wants to drive.
That's one thing.</v>

900
00:53:20.781 --> 00:53:24.110
He did not put that in there.
If she just wanted to leave to go be by herself.

901
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:27.100
There's nothing more frustrating than when you're hurt and you're emotional and

902
00:53:27.101 --> 00:53:30.690
you want to leave.
A Roman people won't let you leave.
It's fucking annoying.

903
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.740
All right.
If she has no history of trying to hurt herself,
she's not drunk.

904
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.700
You got to let her leave.
Um,
the fact that you just said,

905
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:43.701
you calmly coolly waited for the fucking exact moment to reach in and slapped

906
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:47.400
her across the face means you contemplated this shit.

907
00:53:47.401 --> 00:53:52.050
It's like she hit you and then you reacted
and did it.

908
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.810
You made the decision,
you thought about it and you waited for them.

909
00:53:54.811 --> 00:53:59.400
So that went from like fucking second degree to first degree.
Um,
so yeah,

910
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:01.260
no you didn't do the right thing and you should,

911
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.040
I would feel terrible if I fucking did that.
Um,

912
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.720
<v 3>okay.</v>

913
00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:11.430
<v 0>And how can you stop things from being fucked up from here on out?
Uh,</v>

914
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:12.780
<v 3>okay.</v>

915
00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:17.780
<v 0>Well I would sit down and I would just keep playing over and over again how it</v>

916
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:23.121
escalated and you kind of zigged every time you should have zagged and just try

917
00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:26.300
to think of what you can do the next time.
But uh,

918
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.570
calmly coolly picking the exact moment to slap your sister in the face on

919
00:54:31.571 --> 00:54:32.404
Christmas Eve.

920
00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

921
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.930
<v 0>Yeah.
I would say you did,
you did the wrong thing.
I mean,
like I said,
literally,</v>

922
00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:39.390
unless she was literally going to be doing physical harm.

923
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:40.520
<v 3>Okay.</v>

924
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.080
<v 0>To,
uh,
well I guess she hit you felt God,
that's so fucked up.</v>

925
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.450
<v 3>Okay.</v>

926
00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:48.330
<v 0>I'm not even thinking that she kicked you in the face and she did all of that</v>

927
00:54:48.331 --> 00:54:49.164
type of stuff.

928
00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:51.613
<v 3>Okay.</v>

929
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:54.450
<v 0>Um,
I still got to say,
cause they were holding her back.</v>

930
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.470
It's just one of the things that women get to get away with.
They get it,

931
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:00.850
they get to get away with the salt better.
And you,
she like,

932
00:55:00.851 --> 00:55:04.080
you shouldn't fucking hit him,
but I'll fucked up.
Is it that even as a guy,

933
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.050
I wasn't even validating the point that she kicked you in the face?

934
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

935
00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:12.410
<v 0>And uh,
punched you square in the eye with an insane look on her face.</v>

936
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.640
I think it's very easily for me to be sitting here in bed,

937
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.300
not emotionally invested in any of this to say whether the fuck you did the

938
00:55:20.301 --> 00:55:24.920
right thing or the wrong thing.
Um,
you know,
you got a,
a,

939
00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:26.840
your family's gone through a fucked up time.

940
00:55:26.841 --> 00:55:30.260
You throw alcohol in there and some old fucking pictures and uh,

941
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:35.040
you know,
your sister,
you know,

942
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:38.460
puts her hands on you when you hit her back.
I mean,
I dunno,
I dunno.

943
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.570
I would have to look,

944
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.030
maybe could you said you calmly and coolly pick the exact moment when to reach

945
00:55:45.031 --> 00:55:47.490
out.
I don't know.
Maybe that's what fucking threw me off.
But like,

946
00:55:47.491 --> 00:55:51.720
if this all went down and like fucking three seconds,
uh,
you know,

947
00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:54.080
I think you guys all need some fucking group therapy.
Um,

948
00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:58.220
all I can say is I'm glad I wasn't there.
I'm glad I wasn't at that.
Yeah.
Party.

949
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:03.160
That's all I can say about that one.
However,

950
00:56:03.161 --> 00:56:07.660
I do feel that I owe you an apology for judging your actions without even taking

951
00:56:07.661 --> 00:56:10.930
any consideration that you took two hits to the head,
to the face.

952
00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.030
You hit me in the face.
Right.
Um,

953
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.560
<v 3>okay.</v>

954
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.393
<v 0>And you know,</v>

955
00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:22.230
I've seen women like that and I know how hard they punch and kick and all that

956
00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:24.250
shit and they have no concern

957
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.680
for the fact that they wearing shoes and they kick you in the face.
So just said,

958
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:31.630
you know,
they way over a hundred pounds in,

959
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:34.180
who wants to get hit by somebody weighs a hundred pounds right in the fucking

960
00:56:34.181 --> 00:56:35.710
face.
You don't.

961
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.760
And that the natural reaction to getting hit is to hit back and they got that

962
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:42.740
whole,
well cause I'm a girl.
You can't do it yet.
I can just fucking

963
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.920
break all the fucking rules in the,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's one of the things,

964
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:49.000
but you know,
something I,

965
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.470
<v 1>okay.</v>

966
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:54.020
<v 0>Maybe that's just one of the,
one of the perks you get for being a woman,</v>

967
00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:55.760
you know,
they got to have their period every month.

968
00:56:55.761 --> 00:56:59.090
They got to go through fucking labor.
You know what I mean?

969
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:01.340
They got to get all those free drinks.

970
00:57:01.341 --> 00:57:03.170
They always get the house during a divorce.
I mean,

971
00:57:03.171 --> 00:57:05.210
there's a lot of things that they have to go through that maybe,

972
00:57:05.211 --> 00:57:09.440
maybe it's okay that they can hit us.
I have no fucking idea.
Um,

973
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:14.030
all I know is that,
you know,
if a woman ever hits you,
you just,

974
00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:18.050
you just fucking walk away.
You just walk away.
And,
um,

975
00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.760
if they're not related to you,
you just end the relationship like this is over.

976
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:26.150
Yeah.
You know,
W are you coming back to woody and get me a gift now?
Where am I?

977
00:57:26.151 --> 00:57:28.890
I'm,
I'm like the battered woman now and we're like,
oh,
we'd,

978
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:33.740
she's usually not like that.
She shuts a good for us to go fuck yourself over.

979
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.810
Um,
all right,
so what I would do a file.
Okay.
Did I do the wrong thing?

980
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:43.340
Anica how can I keep things for being fucked up from here on out?
Um,
okay.

981
00:57:43.341 --> 00:57:44.480
This is what the first thing you could do.

982
00:57:44.481 --> 00:57:49.030
I would not drink whiskey around volatile family members.
Uh,

983
00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.230
I wouldn't do that.
I would try to be the sober person.

984
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:54.110
I think if you were more sober,
I,
you probably wouldn't have done that.

985
00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:55.720
Or at the very least she would have saw the punch come.

986
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:58.400
It sounded like she threw a straight right.
You know,

987
00:57:58.401 --> 00:57:59.840
you have made a little slip that you know,

988
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:06.830
fucker with,
sorry that that happened.
And uh,
you know,
I dunno,

989
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.550
you guys kind of evened out.
She hit you twice.
You only hit her once.
Said,

990
00:58:10.551 --> 00:58:14.300
maybe that's fair.
Who the fuck knows?
I don't fucking know.
But I,
I don't,

991
00:58:14.301 --> 00:58:16.940
I don't buy into that whole chivalry thing that,
you know,

992
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:21.830
that once somebody starts swinging on you,
it's,
they've,
they've,
they've fucking,

993
00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:23.443
you know,

994
00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:28.670
they've waived all rights of chivalry and,
uh,

995
00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:33.320
in rules between the sexes in my own opinion.
But like,
it's the fat.
It's,

996
00:58:33.321 --> 00:58:37.010
but for the guy though is,
is if he reacts immediately,

997
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.860
I give you a pass.
But the fact that you've thought about it,

998
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:43.520
it shows to come back to,
even though she deserves it,

999
00:58:43.521 --> 00:58:48.080
she's still a lady and then you don't,
I mean,
personally,
I could,
I could,
uh,

1000
00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.870
well I guess he never say never,
but I've never run into that.

1001
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:53.510
And I've had a lot of women hit me.
I mean,
I'm an asshole.

1002
00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:58.670
I've had a lot of women hit me.
Uh,
I've had women throw shit at me.
Um,

1003
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:04.220
but it's never a,
it's never gotten to that point where I,
I would,
I,

1004
00:59:04.221 --> 00:59:05.270
I couldn't do that.
She's a bill.

1005
00:59:05.271 --> 00:59:09.050
It's like hitting a fucking kid or a dog or some shit.
You know,
I couldn't,

1006
00:59:09.051 --> 00:59:12.980
I couldn't do it like an animal.
They're defenseless.
You know what I mean?

1007
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:17.270
Unless it's like Rhonda Rousey,
who's fighting this fucking weekend?
Everybody,

1008
00:59:17.271 --> 00:59:21.020
you know,
fuck.
If you,
if you're,
there's a question for you.

1009
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:26.230
You're dating someone who is not just takes karate or fucking MMA shit is

1010
00:59:27.561 --> 00:59:31.820
actually in the UFC.
That,
what does that become?

1011
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:33.163
You know what I mean?

1012
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.300
If she fucking hits you to say you survive that.

1013
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.640
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1014
00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:46.630
<v 0>Oh God.</v>

1015
00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:52.320
There's not a woman who's even remotely thought about getting into the UFC.

1016
00:59:52.571 --> 00:59:53.770
That couldn't kick the shit out of me.

1017
00:59:53.771 --> 00:59:57.490
I can't imagine fighting one that was actually in the UFC and be fucking

1018
00:59:57.491 --> 01:00:00.970
hilarious.
Then later,
they're apologizes.
I have a stake over my eye.

1019
01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:05.930
I'll make it up to your freckles,
right?

1020
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.470
Ex girlfriend is a cunt.

1021
01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:12.070
Jesus fucking James Blunt here.

1022
01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:15.460
Ex girlfriend is a cunt.
Hey Bill.

1023
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.910
I am a lady and a huge fan of yours.

1024
01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:21.410
I love Nia as well.
Uh,

1025
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:27.400
get her on the case if possible,
please.
Oh,
well she's still downstairs sleeping.

1026
01:00:27.401 --> 01:00:31.450
Okay.
I dig other ladies and recently I broke up.

1027
01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.600
I broke a very important relationship in my life.

1028
01:00:34.601 --> 01:00:39.130
I was dating this girl on and off for many years and felt totally in love with

1029
01:00:39.131 --> 01:00:41.080
her.
Um,

1030
01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:45.720
all the while she claims she loved me more than anything,
uh,

1031
01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:49.660
was she still does claim,
by the way,
by the way,
and says,

1032
01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:53.830
I am the only person she has ever wanted to spend your life with.
However,

1033
01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:57.430
she's one of these people who just needs her freedom and can't function in a

1034
01:00:57.431 --> 01:01:01.210
fucking relationship.
Well,
then you got to let it go.
Uh,
before we broke up,

1035
01:01:01.211 --> 01:01:03.850
we had this huge fucking argument about commitment and I said,

1036
01:01:03.851 --> 01:01:06.400
I didn't see the point in continuing this relationship.

1037
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.980
She reflected on it and said,
I was absolutely right.

1038
01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.790
That I don't deserve to dedicate my entire life to someone as complicated as
her.

1039
01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.520
Well,
yeah,
I agree with her and walk.
I agreed.

1040
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:20.670
She then said she tried but can't reciprocate my feelings in the same intensity.

1041
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.823
All right.

1042
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:27.900
That was eight years before this broad was jerking me around saying I'm the love

1043
01:01:28.421 --> 01:01:33.400
of her life.
And she wanted to marry me and live with me forever.
All these years,

1044
01:01:33.401 --> 01:01:36.310
every time I confronted her about her troublesome behavior,

1045
01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:40.360
there was never cheating at least.
Uh,
she didn't tell me,
hey,

1046
01:01:40.361 --> 01:01:42.610
I don't think our feelings match.
This may not work.

1047
01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:45.930
She led me to believe she loved me enough.
Uh,

1048
01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.260
she's still saying I'm the love of her life and whatnot,

1049
01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.320
but feels horrible for all the pain she's caused me and the time I wasted.

1050
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.730
I said,
being in love,

1051
01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:58.150
the love of her life wasn't enough to make her act like a good girlfriend.

1052
01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.750
And then I wanted to move on with my life.
So we parted ways.
Good for you.

1053
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:05.650
Strong move.
I like that move.
Now I'm not sure what to do,
where to start.

1054
01:02:05.651 --> 01:02:10.340
My identity is so intertwined with this intertwined with this person.
You know,

1055
01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:12.610
we used to be in the beginning,
I want to start over,

1056
01:02:12.611 --> 01:02:15.010
but I don't know who I am outside of this relationship.

1057
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:18.370
I like to hear your thoughts about it cause I think you guys give some good

1058
01:02:18.371 --> 01:02:22.800
advice.
All right.
I would say this,
what you're feeling is totally normal.

1059
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:26.520
And what a lot of people do is when they feel those feelings of like,

1060
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:30.810
well now what do I do?
Who am I?
How do I pick up the fucking pieces?

1061
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:35.340
There is that initial feeling,

1062
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:40.950
which does not feel good and your natural reaction is to go for the quickest
fix,

1063
01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.440
which is to go back into that fucking horrible relationship.

1064
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:47.730
What you have to do as the song goes,
you got to walk through the fire here.

1065
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:51.560
I would write down,
you know,

1066
01:02:51.561 --> 01:02:54.540
I would start a journal and something so you can kind of,
you know,

1067
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:59.460
it's something to just be feeling your thoughts versus writing them down and

1068
01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:02.250
then you can see him and then you can kind of get outside of yourself,

1069
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:05.490
which is what you need right now.
And you know,
friends help with this too.

1070
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.560
We have to be like,
look,
you can't go back to this person.
You know that.

1071
01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.270
Okay.
But right now is like the worst part is now you're going to be lonely and

1072
01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:16.770
heartbroken by yourself.

1073
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.220
And this person that usually conferred you is the cause of it.

1074
01:03:20.221 --> 01:03:23.220
So you can't go to them for comfort because it's going to fuck you all up and

1075
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:25.920
get you back to square one.
So,
um,

1076
01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.713
um,

1077
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.560
<v 3>okay.</v>

1078
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.530
<v 0>You're asking me what you should do is I think that you should</v>

1079
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:37.940
acknowledged the fact that you're going to get you what you have to go through

1080
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:42.620
some pain.
You're going to go through some pain over the next,
like you know,

1081
01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.660
certainly three months.

1082
01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.800
But what you do during that time is you gradually build a new life without this

1083
01:03:51.381 --> 01:03:52.214
person.

1084
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.990
So the first month you're going to be in the fetal position crying and just,

1085
01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.540
you know,
going through the neck,
shoulder,
psych.

1086
01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.320
So I went to detox of this person.

1087
01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.380
But what I would try to do is introduce a new fun activity.

1088
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.990
You know,
that you could do like,
I dunno,
whatever the fuck it's into,

1089
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.140
even if it's like a fucking TV show,
the emit to binge watch.

1090
01:04:19.141 --> 01:04:23.360
Something as simple as that.
That is something that you do.

1091
01:04:23.361 --> 01:04:26.540
And in that it's yours that you don't do what this other person.

1092
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:31.370
And then you just introduce something else when he ready for something else.

1093
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.490
Maybe you always wanted to learn how to ride a horse.
Go fucking do that.

1094
01:04:34.491 --> 01:04:37.400
God knows she got the God damn time,
something fun.

1095
01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:39.350
But there's something that you've always wanted to do,

1096
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:43.250
but she didn't have the time with work.
It being involved in relationship.

1097
01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.900
Go do that fucking thing.
Take a trip,
do something.

1098
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.960
And all the time when you feel INSEAD given to the sadness and cry some of that

1099
01:04:53.091 --> 01:04:56.750
fucking paint out.
I'm a big believer in crying.
Um,

1100
01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.790
it's something that guys are not allowed to do.

1101
01:04:58.791 --> 01:05:01.850
It's why women get past shit and guys carry shit.

1102
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:05.100
Women's still can look back and see the sadness,
but they're done.

1103
01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.090
Finland fucked up over cause they didn't hold onto the emotion.

1104
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:12.610
They let the emotion out.
Guys hold the fucking thing.
And like,

1105
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.630
I believe that guys should,
you know,

1106
01:05:14.631 --> 01:05:18.400
cause it's too embarrassing for people to see us cry.
They should in every house,

1107
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:20.860
the way you have a bathroom,
a bedroom,
a kitchen,

1108
01:05:20.861 --> 01:05:24.940
there should be a crying room for the men.
He goes into,

1109
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.420
closes the door,
it's soundproof.
And he's allowed to go in there,

1110
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.730
in whale out all of his fucking pain,

1111
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:34.360
the way women are and everyone flocks to them and hugs him and gives him
comfort.

1112
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:38.290
And,
uh,
you know,
I'm a big believer in it now than after,

1113
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.800
after half a century holding it in.
I believe that you should fucking let it out.

1114
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.370
He should go Chris Bosch if you're a guy.
Um,

1115
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:48.430
so that's what I would say to you and just acknowledge the fact that this is

1116
01:05:48.431 --> 01:05:51.250
going to hurt.
I'm proud of you that you got out of this relationship,
you know,

1117
01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.100
eight years of this person jerking you around and you know what you did.

1118
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:57.670
You got out of something toxic and you opened the door for the right person to

1119
01:05:57.671 --> 01:05:58.630
come into your life.

1120
01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:02.170
You know someone that's going to respect you and make you laugh and you have a

1121
01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:02.950
great time,
you know,

1122
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:06.040
and one day you can look back on what the fuck did I waste eight years with that

1123
01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:07.270
person?
And you know why you did.

1124
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.180
So you can realize how great the person that's going to come and see you life is

1125
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:14.200
going to be.
And there you go.
There's your pep talk.
All right,
you can do it.

1126
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:16.300
I believe in you.
All right,
here we go.

1127
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.570
Let's read the last two fucking ads here and then I got to get the folk adhe.

1128
01:06:20.571 --> 01:06:24.250
Here are right.
Um Oh blue apron.
Everybody.

1129
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.070
Hey is something you could do.
By the way,
if the person who just,

1130
01:06:27.071 --> 01:06:32.071
I just read because one of the things you might want you might do is eat a bunch

1131
01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:35.800
of food and put on fucking weight.
You don't want to do that.
You know?

1132
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:40.090
That's like another being another bad fucking thing that this person created.

1133
01:06:40.091 --> 01:06:42.520
They broke your heart and now they're going to fucking put more stress on your

1134
01:06:42.521 --> 01:06:44.440
heart because you're going to eat bad food.

1135
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:48.090
You know what it'd be great to thing is he ate healthy meals and you know what?

1136
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.840
You're crying.
You're in the fetal position.

1137
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:53.170
Would it be great if somebody just brought the food to you?
Blue Apron.

1138
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.170
This is like the fucking,
this is the best move you can make.

1139
01:06:56.171 --> 01:06:58.960
If you go through a breakup right here,
blue apron,

1140
01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.990
they're going to bring your healthy food.
It's easy to fucking cook.

1141
01:07:01.991 --> 01:07:03.340
You going to stay in shape,

1142
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.580
right as you get over that fucking last asshole at con.

1143
01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:10.150
That was in your fucking life.
And a,
you're going to be a good shape.

1144
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:13.000
Does baby attracting somebody else in your life?
Who knows,

1145
01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:16.810
but do not just jump into something.
I forgot that part of the advice.

1146
01:07:16.811 --> 01:07:18.610
Do not jump into another fucking relationship.

1147
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.290
I would stay after an eight year thing.

1148
01:07:20.291 --> 01:07:24.010
You need to stay single for at least a fucking year,
I would think.
Uh,

1149
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.700
and that'll make you so fucking strong.
You,
you,
you,
you'll be looking back on,

1150
01:07:27.701 --> 01:07:30.220
I can't believe I used to be that other person.
