00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.610
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:05.670
Is Bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.750
March 19th,

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.110
2018 what's going on?
How,

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.480
why is that loud enough with my ears shot?

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.820
Um,
what's going on?
I'm really,
I'm super late.
I apologize.
I apologize to anybody.

7
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.821
I may have offended a Rolex Americans,

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.560
um,
anybody indigenous to the clock world,
you know.
Oh,
sorry.
Original.

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.880
I learned that when I was up in Canada.
They do not want to be called indigenous.

10
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:39.840
They want to be called the original cog.
The old Geezer.
This shit.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.450
That's what they want to be called pre provinces.
You white motherfuckers.

12
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.970
I believe that's what they said.
Except they said it with a drum.

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.480
Now they didn't do they burn the,

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.930
the originals up in Canada that they communicate through drums too.

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.830
You know,
it's so funny.
Once white people got their hands on it,

16
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:03.030
all of a sudden all communication,
just start
with that instrument.

17
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
Um,
well that's because we invented the fucking phone.

18
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:12.930
You dumb fuck eight.
Keep it fucking classy there.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.980
I'm
sorry.

20
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.570
I'm in a fucked up mood.
I flew back from Toronto late last night.

21
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.620
I was in Kitchener or Kitchener.
I have no idea.

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.350
Came up with a great fucking touristy tee shirt for those people out there.

23
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.740
All right.
If he can't stand the heat,
get out of the Kitchener.
Huh?

24
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.691
They need something.

25
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.270
They need some swagger out there because everybody was giving me shit.

26
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:40.680
Why you flood plain old [inaudible].
There we go.

27
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.770
First of all,
I was just in Toronto.
And then secondly,

28
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.750
those people like entertainment too.

29
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.170
But now they got to drive an hour and a half all the way in.

30
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.340
They got to pay for parking.

31
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.680
If they're going to booze now they've got to get a room and all of a sudden

32
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:57.360
becomes this big fucking deal.
So I like going to places like Kitchener and uh,

33
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.960
Hamilton neck casino on the other side of Detroit.

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.210
And then there was that other one,
that Casino Rama,

35
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.720
that Gig where I left the rental car.
I ever tell you guys said fucking story.

36
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.900
I left a rental car there,
man.
Um,
we went out,

37
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.990
we did the show.
I'm not naming any names in this one.
Okay.

38
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.750
Me and some friends of mine.
Okay.
Not My usual friends.

39
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:19.980
These friends were readers,

40
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.840
these were big readers and they never predicted anything.
Okay.

41
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.620
Um,
they didn't predict someone was going to be a hall of Famer after one at bat.

42
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.850
It was not anybody like that.
Wink,
wink,
nudge,
nudge.
Anyways,

43
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.190
so we were up there at Casino Rama and um,
we drove up from someplace else.

44
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:41.160
I can't remember,
we'd done a couple of gigs out there and uh,

45
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.010
like march madness was going on or some sort of ladies hockey for some metal

46
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.230
assumption.
I can't remember what.
And we went out,

47
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.600
did the show and we went out and got fucking hammered,

48
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.530
hammered knowing that we had an early flight and then I had her turn this rental

49
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:01.780
car.
So we keep looking at the watch guys.
You know,

50
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.260
we kinda gotta be up at 5:00 AM it's,
it's midnight.
That's five hours sleep.

51
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.190
One more,
one more bubble Nexia.
We got it.
We got it.

52
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:13.191
And I swear to God and like three in the fricking morning and I am hammered that

53
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.650
I mentioned I was drunk,
I was fucking hammered.

54
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.750
So wake up like two hours later,
you know,

55
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.520
with a bunch of snacks opened from the fucking hotel bar.
One of those nights,

56
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.990
you know,
trying to get down like another whiskey.
I maybe got one swig out of it,

57
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.200
like Denzel in that movie where he fucking flies the plane upside down.

58
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.410
He some overcome losing his rear stabilizer

59
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.440
and the first guy ever in the history of aviation.
Um,

60
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.490
and then I uh,
you know,

61
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.170
open can of Pringles and a kit Kat.
I think so.
I stumbled downstairs.
All right.

62
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:57.560
We're,
you know,
and we get in the fucking car,
right?

63
00:03:57.561 --> 00:04:00.990
I'm still fucking hammered.
I'm like,
guys,
I'm too fucking drunk to drive.

64
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.200
And they're like,
dude,
the airports right down the street,

65
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.590
this is how every faith fatal drinking and driving story happens.

66
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.770
It's right down the street.
So we look at our fucking gps cause was still,

67
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:14.540
we still on the hotels fucking thing there and we were trying to memorize it

68
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:17.570
because none of us got a plan when we were up there.
Well,
wouldn't,
you know,

69
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.930
we leave the hotel's fucking airspace and we can't figure out where we're going.

70
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.810
It's,
it's fucking low visibility.
It's still pitch black out.

71
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:29.210
And now we have no map.

72
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.660
I don't know where I'm at and we're all fucking hammered.
And I was just like,

73
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:33.770
dude,
I can't do this.

74
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.280
So we literally got like a fucking quarter mile down the street,

75
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.480
turned back around,
go back to the hotel and we say,
listen to,
cause we Kinda,

76
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.090
you know,
hit it off with the guy behind the fucking,
uh,

77
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.970
the counter that can do as favor.
You know,
what can you,

78
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.180
is there any way you can return this rental car?
And the guy goes,
no problem,

79
00:04:50.181 --> 00:04:53.090
no problem.
We'll call you a cab.
I got my buddy,
he'll come down,

80
00:04:53.091 --> 00:04:55.110
he'll return the fucking thing,
blah,
blah,
blah.
No problem.

81
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:56.150
So now we're sweating it,
right?

82
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.350
But it turns out that the pilots and shit are also waiting for a car and we were

83
00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:03.440
on their flight or whatever,
somehow,
so African,
it's all fucking foggy.

84
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.930
So we ended up getting there.
We make the flight back

85
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.330
laughing our asses off.
Hey,
we did it.

86
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:15.360
You know what a good shit that guy returns the fucking car.
What an awesome guy.

87
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.860
Right.
And I,

88
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:22.310
I passed out on the plane and I wake up in la like nothing ever happened.
So,
um,

89
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.520
I fucking,
uh,

90
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.360
maybe like three weeks later I get this phone call from the rental company

91
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.090
and they will like,
yeah,
Mr Raw,
you ever going to return that rental car?

92
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.570
I told this story wrong.
I shouldn't told you that I left it to the hotel guy.

93
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.780
I had completely forgot.
I even,
I,
that's how drunk I was.

94
00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:44.870
I didn't even remember that part where I said that I was gonna fucking that.

95
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:47.390
I told the guy at the hotel and I was like,
yeah,
it returned.

96
00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:50.390
It returned like three weeks ago and at this point I've done like three mile

97
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:53.150
road gigs,
so I don't even remember it.
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
it did.

98
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.360
How did you get my number?
You keep my number.
I was all about me.

99
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.820
So they start badgering me in my fucking world and I'm just like,
you know,

100
00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:04.660
I have to like the fourth or fifth phone call.
I was like,
listen,
stop calling me.

101
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.990
I returned the rental car.
Stop calling me on my cell phone.

102
00:06:07.991 --> 00:06:11.650
I'm at work and level done.
Then just one time,
I don't know what happened,

103
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.130
like the sixth time they called me,
something just clicked.
I was like,

104
00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:18.520
wait a minute.
We sent that gig where I was hammered

105
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.550
and there will clouds on the ground and I,

106
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:24.520
the guy behind the counter said he was going to,
or some people called fog,

107
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.210
we're going to fucking return the rental car.
Oh fuck.

108
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.090
So I had to call after yelling at these people,
I to call him and be like,
Yo,

109
00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:36.820
listen,
I'm the guy you called like six times ago.
Uh,

110
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:42.090
I got really drunk and uh,
try to drive,
but I couldn't.
The guide,
the hotel Shah,

111
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.080
he was kind of thinking,
dude ended up fucking going down to the car,

112
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:47.914
was still sitting there.

113
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.430
I had to pay a month rental on that thing.

114
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:58.540
I can't even fucking tell you how much money that cost me.
Um,

115
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.060
but whatever.
That's not the big news.

116
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.170
The big news as announced by Barstool sports.

117
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:08.380
Remember I was telling you rough and rowdy was going to be a juggernaut and I

118
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:09.280
would just blah,
blah,
blah.

119
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.760
That and I thought it was just the greatest frigging idea ever.
It's literally,

120
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.960
it's like American idol meets the UFC.

121
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.190
All those people that think they can fucking sing and want to prove it and then

122
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.920
look what happened.
Some of them come out of there and they win grammys.

123
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.171
So who knows?

124
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:28.870
Maybe one of these people when there's rough and rowdy thing could actually

125
00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:33.430
someday get in the UFC house,
right?
And then,
then next thing you know,

126
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.420
fucking a,
he's all,
he's on one of those pay per views.

127
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.790
But until then they were at the bar stool sports,

128
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:43.670
a rough and rowdy number tree trois.
And uh,

129
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.210
I'm actually going to be ringside thrown in some jokes.

130
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.020
You guys got to get this man,
you have to get this fucking paper view.

131
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:52.420
I'm telling you,
I'm going to be making fun of people.

132
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.860
I'm going to be making fun of myself.
It's uh,

133
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.040
it's $15 and 99 cents to watch regular people beat the shit out of each other.

134
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.293
You know what I mean?

135
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.660
<v 2>It's the greatest thing,
greatest singer of all time.</v>

136
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.910
<v 0>This is like,
there's certain things you just see coming,
you like,</v>

137
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:15.870
this is gonna be fucking huge.
I the second I saw this,

138
00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:20.460
it's like I'm going to watch every fucking one of these things and I'm,

139
00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:22.440
I don't know,
it was just talking positively about it.

140
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.060
And then a bar stool reached out to the email and they're like,

141
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.540
you want to do this?
So it's just like a,

Fuck yeah,

142

So I'm going to be there.
So tuned in.
Um,

143
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.330
let me see if I can get you the date here.
I'm so fucking excited about this.

144
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.580
I can't even tell you.
Um,
when the hell is it going to be,

145
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.080
I'm the worst kid.
Does anybody promote shit worse than me?

146
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.140
I know that it's going to be in Charlotte,
North Carolina.

147
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.700
<v 2>April 13th.</v>

148
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.220
<v 3>It's going to be April 13th.
Charlotte,
North Carolina,</v>

149
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.570
formal hometown of the nature.
Boy,
ric flair.
I mean,
everything's just,

150
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:08.460
this is serendipity.
It's all fucking lining up.
I can't wait.
Um,
so please,

151
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.680
uh,
you and your friends,
or to the God damn fight,

152
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:13.470
get yourself some beers and who knows,

153
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.500
maybe a watch or get inspired and the next time you'll be on it,

154
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.580
that's just that easy.
Would you ever want to be on TV?

155
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.340
Try to knock somebody out.
Finally,
there's a vehicle for you.
So anyways,
uh,

156
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:29.730
why are you so late today,
bill?
Well,
I had a busy day.
I,
why?

157
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.790
I flew back from Toronto after our two awesome shows in Kitchener.

158
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.710
Uh,
they're definitely,
they're on,
they're on the toilets now.
I,

159
00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:42.810
they have such awesome people there and a great venue and a,

160
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:46.410
so I flew back late at night cause I wanted to be,
you know,

161
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:48.930
get home late at night.
So when my daughter woke up the next day,

162
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:52.380
I was going to be there.
You know what I mean?
Because of what I do,
you know,

163
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.240
so I missed some days sometimes,
you know,

164
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.180
so like literally the ups guy comes walking up to walk and she's pointing

165
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.400
going.dot,
dot,
dot.
Like,
I can't handle that.

166
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.330
I have too much fucking guilt over it.
All right.
Um,
however,

167
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.950
I do have to provide for my family.
So anyways,
I,
um,

168
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.900
I hung with my daughter in the morning and then I had this meeting from 10 to
12.

169
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.130
And then when I came back,

170
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.760
my wife told me that she was going to take our daughter to go see the Easter

171
00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:22.440
bunny.
And I was like,
well,
I don't want to miss that.
So I went over there and,
uh,

172
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.100
you know,
last year she was fine because she was only like,
you know,

173
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.070
four or five months old.
And this year she's like,
you know,

174
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:32.910
coming up on a year and a half or whatever.
And uh,

175
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.200
you know,
I just felt this vibe.
I was just,

176
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:42.201
she was looking at the fucking person in this outfit and I'm just looking at it

177
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:46.140
like,
I dunno about this one,
right?
So we're trying to be like,
hey,

178
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:48.090
and the bunnies fucking waving at her and shit.

179
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.050
And I went up and I'm shaking the rabbits hand and stuff like,
see,
it's safe.

180
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:55.380
It's not cutting my head off.
And she's just looking at the rabbit,
like,

181
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:57.960
I dunno about this man.
She's like dead dude and platoon.

182
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:59.850
I got a bad feel above this man.

183
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.530
So we bring her up there and immediately like I go to kind of hand it to the,

184
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.820
to the fucking dude in the bunny suit and I just feel her just grab two handfuls

185
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:11.520
of my t shirt.
I'm like,
oh no.

186
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.010
And then I was like,
she started screaming and then I handed it to my wife.

187
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:20.520
My wife ended up happened to sit down with her with the rabbit.

188
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.820
She's totally crying,
totally freaked out and all that.

189
00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:27.330
And the whole time I'm just sitting there going,
why do we do this to kids?

190
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.030
Why am I doing this in a freaking this kid out with a fucking person in a

191
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:37.290
Goddamn bunny suit?
It makes no sense to the kid.
And at the end,

192
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.150
at the end of all of this horse shit,

193
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.080
it's a fucking lie doll thing is a fucking lie.

194
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:45.690
And then one day you got to turn around and tell your kid it's not real

195
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.290
and it's just as selfish adult thing because you love your kids so much.

196
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:54.180
You wanted to see,
get excited.

197
00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.080
<v 0>You know when you grew up and you saw how mean and cold hearted the world is,</v>

198
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.630
you just want to see him fucking believe in something.

199
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.810
And then just early on you just break the trust by telling them that as he's

200
00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:12.380
fucking people that come by.
Some of them are animals in Italy.
I mean,

201
00:12:12.381 --> 00:12:16.070
some of them are fairies and all of this shit.
Um,

202
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.280
but then what do you do?
Do you tell your kid that,
that,
that,

203
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:25.040
that they don't exist and then they go to school to come to school like some

204
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.510
grizzled fucking vet.
And let me tell you some kids,
it's all bullshit,
right?

205
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.540
Just to tell it all these kids that the bunny does it exist in Santa Claus

206
00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:38.510
doesn't exist to that.
Everybody's getting fucking mad at your kid.

207
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.110
It's a great life lesson actually for your kid.

208
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.280
That's what happens when you tell the truth.
Oh,

209
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.950
he's on his fucking stuck right now.

210
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

211
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.670
<v 0>Yeah.
If you ever want to get yelled at that,
there you go.</v>

212
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:58.570
Send your kid to school with the truth about Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.

213
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.200
And you just sit,
say your kid,
just say,
listen,

214
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.120
everybody talks about reading to your kid,

215
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:05.680
trying to give them a headstart and all that.

216
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.960
Why don't you fucking give them a headstart and not fucking tell them about all

217
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.690
that shit?
What am I?
Relatives did that with one of my nephews,
you know,

218
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.490
and the kid grew up fine.
They just sat it down like,
yeah,
listen,

219
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.260
it's all bullshit.
You know?

220
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.680
I remember when I found out my older brother told me and um,

221
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.380
he felt betrayed and when he told me I felt like an adult,

222
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.080
I was like,
no ways.
Didn't ain't no thanks for the heads up.

223
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.640
Then I sat there and kept my mouth shut like an old school mobster.

224
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:46.520
I never told my,
my other brothers never said Shit.
I just sat there.

225
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.160
Oh yeah,
he's coming right down the fucking chimney.
Then I sit there laughing,

226
00:13:50.161 --> 00:13:51.990
listen to my younger brother's telling me stories.

227
00:13:51.991 --> 00:13:55.980
I saw his sleigh go right off the roof of digits you lying piece of Shit,

228
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.800
you know,
and let me know.
Let me know who they really were.

229
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:04.080
I learned who I could trust in my family.
Having that insight information.

230
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.870
I think that's why they're trying to get that Alexa and everybody's house so

231
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:14.160
then they can tell you know who they can trust and who they can't trust and not

232
00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:18.390
really for a good reason either.
You know,
there is corrupt as I am,

233
00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:22.760
except they're running shit.
I have no idea what I'm talking about right now.

234
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:28.070
Um,
I lied to you guys earlier.
I didn't have a meeting from 10 to 12.

235
00:14:28.071 --> 00:14:33.071
What I did was I went out and I flew out to camera Rio and then down the coast

236
00:14:33.651 --> 00:14:34.850
along Malibu.
I,

237
00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:39.680
one of the most perfect fucking days ever while the whales are migrating.
Okay.

238
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.510
I should have literally had like fucking Yoga,

239
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.400
Yoga music playing in my fucking,
uh,

240
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.710
headset.
It was,
it was fucking unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.
Uh,

241
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.050
I dunno,
whatever.
Sorry.
I skate.
You got me.
I apologize.

242
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.130
And we were supposed to take our kid.
I'm to be totally honest with you guys,

243
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:03.770
and I'm supposed to take the kids to see these two bony tomorrow and then my

244
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:05.360
wife's schedule flip flopped around.

245
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.400
And it was more convenient for her to go today.

246
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.230
It was more convenient for us to go tomorrow,

247
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.320
but it's more convenient for her to go today.
So what do you think happened?

248
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.840
You know what happened?
God dammit,
you know exactly what happened.
Oh,

249
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.060
I went to a Toronto Raptors game by the way,

250
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.300
on the Sunday and I went to that Okc game.

251
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:27.230
That game was like fucking one 32 to one 26 something crazy like that was almost

252
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:30.260
like an all star game score.
And um,

253
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.460
we had great seats and all of that stuff.
It just was fucking awesome.

254
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:37.940
Great Fan base to Jesus Christ.
I know you guys love the leafs,

255
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:40.760
but obviously Toronto is doing great this year,
but uh,

256
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.710
it's a really fun game to watch and um,
that knocked off.

257
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.970
I've seen every professional Canadian fucking team,

258
00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:54.020
a home game of them except for the Goddamn fucking Ottawa senators.

259
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.190
And every time I schedule something to go see one of their games,

260
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:02.630
something comes up and I can't make it all right the first time.
Unfortunately,

261
00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:06.770
one of my great friends in life passed away and I had to go to the funeral and

262
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:08.840
all that,
so that's understandable.
All right.

263
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:12.440
And the second time it was just like,
all right,
I'm flying in two days early.

264
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.030
I'm a dad now.

265
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:17.570
I'm going to miss 48 hours with my daughter to go to a fucking Ottawa senators

266
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:20.640
game.
I couldn't justify it,
so I canceled that.
So it's really,

267
00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:24.980
it has nothing to do with Ottawa or their franchise or any of that type of shit.

268
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:29.180
But,
um,
I believe that they're actually making a new,
a new arena.

269
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.450
Isn't that unbelievable?
It's like what is wrong with the other one?

270
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.420
The other one is totally fine.

271
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:38.600
That's like the Atlanta Braves moving out of their totally perfectly fine

272
00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:39.530
baseball stadium.

273
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.170
The Atlanta Falcons moving out of their totally perfectly fine fucking dome.

274
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.680
Like what are we doing?
And then they take,
what did you,

275
00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:49.490
what did they do with all of that material?
I want to stay.

276
00:16:49.491 --> 00:16:53.450
Not someone should make a fucking documentary on that when they knocked down a

277
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:58.170
fucking stadium.
That works fine.
All right.
But the owners,

278
00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.023
all you

279
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.670
fucking move them get fat.
Fuck.

280
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.350
I'm sick of seeing cities being held hostage by these fucking crybaby owners,

281
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.910
especially the fucking NFL.
Those fucking assholes.

282
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.810
Such a great game.
Such a crew,
a console that runs it.

283
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.700
How much more fucking money to those assholes need to me need to make before

284
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:25.770
their pony up for a fucking stadium?
You know what,

285
00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:29.630
without threatening or everybody that they're gonna walk out,
no one full.

286
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:32.990
Well that most people are like me and they don't read.

287
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.530
They don't have any other passions.
They got nothing else going on in their life.

288
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.090
Knowing full well that if they,
the politicians would be like,
well,

289
00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:45.230
if we let this fucking thing go,
I'm not going to get voted into office.

290
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.010
I'm a Bob craft.
Even though he ponied up money for the,

291
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.380
he was going to a good burger.

292
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.980
Dota condotti kick him and he's dumped fucking loafers.
I love the guy.

293
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.460
I,
there's two things with that happened in the y is a bunch of things that

294
00:17:58.461 --> 00:18:00.860
happened.
My history is a Patriot fan that bugged me.

295
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:05.270
Bill Parcells telling the team that he was allegedly,
that he was going to,

296
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.080
he wasn't coming back the next year before we played the Green Bay packers.

297
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.350
That's why I've still yet to watch the two bills.

298
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:14.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

299
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.600
<v 0>Because somebody who was not connected to the football team told me a long time</v>

300
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.030
ago that he did that and I believed it back then.

301
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.550
The way I believed that there was a Santa Clause,

302
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.380
Bill Parcells has the same body type as Santa Claus and the whole thing comes

303
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:32.370
together and I've just never been able to fucking forgive the guy for something

304
00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:33.550
that I'm not even sure if even.

305
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.013
<v 2>Okay.</v>

306
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.060
<v 0>Um,
what else?</v>

307
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.410
What Bob Kraft said he was gonna move into Connecticut.

308
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:43.400
That was fucking annoying.

309
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.780
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

310
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.060
<v 0>We should have let him do it.
Go ahead.
Moving to Connecticut,</v>

311
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.940
moving to the fucking Hartford whalers old building.

312
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.060
See if you could make it work down there.
You can't make anything work in fucking

313
00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.410
<v 2>Connecticut.
The two divided.</v>

314
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:06.680
<v 0>Yeah,
so I'm a giant fan.
Some of Patriot fans,
some are dirt poor,</v>

315
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.790
the others are in the Illuminati and there's some Klan members.
I mean,

316
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.590
think about that.
What,
what fucking product can you sell?

317
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

318
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.700
<v 0>That's going to appeal to all of those people.</v>

319
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

320
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.790
<v 0>Visit reason why Connecticut lost the whaler state.
They deserved it.
No,</v>

321
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:24.624
I'm just kidding.

322
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.030
I was actually talking to somebody when I was up in Canada that like what was

323
00:19:27.031 --> 00:19:29.850
great about the fucking hockey divisions when I was a kid,

324
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:33.600
when I was just the lad,
the Adams Division in the Patrick's division,

325
00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:34.680
if you had a fucking car,

326
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:39.510
you could literally drive to every road game your team had within its division.

327
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.140
You could probably get there within,
you know,

328
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.770
a couple of hours except for the Quebec Nordiques.

329
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.970
They were way the fuck up there.
Did jumped on a plane.

330
00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:50.130
They will all just like fly to Montreal flight,

331
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:53.250
a buffalo drive down to Hartford.

332
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.930
Then you had the note was Nordiques to Canadians.

333
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.700
Disablers the way Liz in the Bruins that I'm,

334
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.830
I feel like I'm missing somebody.

335
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.370
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

336
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.850
<v 0>Oh,
so long ago.
And then the Patrick Division.
Yeah,
the islanders,</v>

337
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.900
the Rangers,
the devils,
the flyers in the capitals.

338
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:15.450
All five of them were right there.
And then the road trip,

339
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:17.430
the long one was Pittsburgh.

340
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.150
All of them right fucking there.
It's like when you used to see like uh,

341
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.770
those,
those things they do on like,
um,
you know,

342
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:34.120
back in the day when baseball was all on like the east coast essentially and

343
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.810
they would just take trains and there was two teams in Boston,

344
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.330
three teams in New York,
two teams in Philly.

345
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.690
<v 2>Okay.</v>

346
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.620
<v 0>The Philadelphia Athletics,
Philadelphia Phillies,
the New York giants,
new,</v>

347
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:50.230
the Brooklyn Dodgers,
the York Yankees,
formerly the New York Islanders,

348
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:52.540
formerly the original Baltimore Orioles.

349
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.600
Then the new Baltimore Orioles,
formerly the Saint Louis Browns.
Isn't it amazing?

350
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:01.930
I know all of this shit and can't do fucking simple math and have no idea what's

351
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:04.960
going on in the world.
I tried to get a little smarter than on the flight back.

352
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:05.794
I watched this,

353
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.810
Ken Burns did this whole thing on Vietnam and I watched one that was basically

354
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:13.000
1970 to 1971.

355
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:18.001
And what I loved about the documentary is he does not spare the horrors of all

356
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:22.420
of those people that are just showing the dead bodies and all of that shit and

357
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:23.254
just like,

358
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.443
<v 2>mmm.</v>

359
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.350
<v 0>And just done.
So even handedly,
people who protested the war is won.</v>

360
00:21:31.351 --> 00:21:34.350
Marine was saying like,
I had no problem with people protesting the war.

361
00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.773
<v 2>MMM.</v>

362
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:37.900
<v 0>You know,</v>

363
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.390
that's one of the great things about this country and all that type of stuff.

364
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:44.800
But like those people that will like yelling at him and punching his car and all

365
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:49.120
that shit,
like they took it too far and I found that really interesting.

366
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.570
You know that you can,
you can,
because we're Kinda,

367
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.290
I feel like we'll live in that right now to the left,

368
00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.680
except for some reason they're not protesting this never ending fucking war that

369
00:22:00.681 --> 00:22:04.010
is bankrupting this country.
Uh,

370
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.010
because the people in power geniusly

371
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.050
have sold this one that if you criticize it,

372
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:15.610
you don't support troops and you're a socialist slash I think you're an isis.

373
00:22:15.611 --> 00:22:18.460
I think that's the way it goes.
If you're even just as an American going like,

374
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:22.030
hey man,
like I'm down with this country and stuff,

375
00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:27.031
but we're spending $1 billion a month to fight 3,500 people on a jungle gym that

376
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:29.710
train on a jungle gym.

377
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.140
Like that's just for my business standpoint.

378
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.240
How are we going to continue to sustain this?
If you just even ask that,

379
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:40.150
that's immediately put into the,
you don't support the troops.

380
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.770
You don't appreciate people fighting for your freedom.
You're a piece of shit.
Uh,

381
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.850
let's ruin your career.

382
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.910
But I feel that they learned that in Vietnam when they've kind of learned that

383
00:22:51.911 --> 00:22:54.700
if they lost the pub,
obviously you'll lose the public support.

384
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:57.950
Eventually you're going to lose the fucking war.
Um,

385
00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.860
and watching these people,

386
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:02.870
given these speeches so we don't end up at another Vietnam and blah,
blah,
blah,

387
00:23:02.871 --> 00:23:03.704
blah,
blah.

388
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:09.580
And then just seeing some of these hippies acting like me to people,
you know,

389
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:10.331
totally.

390
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:13.390
Just taking it too far that if somebody even looks like their whole life should

391
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:16.180
just fucking be destroyed.
You know what I mean?

392
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.530
One person tries to look up a skirt is somebody who's walking up the stairs,

393
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.760
you know,
flight of stairs.

394
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.930
All of a sudden they're doing jello shots with Harvey Weinstein and some

395
00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:28.150
godforsaken place in fucking Arizona.

396
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.533
<v 2>MMM.</v>

397
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.810
<v 0>I got a great reality show.
You have Harvey Weinstein and Oj Simpson.
You,</v>

398
00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:39.310
they do a road trip,
right.
And they got,

399
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.400
it's like they got,
they start in La

400
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.160
and they got 36 to get to Atlanta to pick up Paula Dean.

401
00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.910
It's like the gumball rally,
you know,
and then she,

402
00:23:51.911 --> 00:23:56.911
cause then she has to go into this big brother house and decide whether or not

403
00:23:57.281 --> 00:24:00.910
she wants to marry dog,
the bounty hunter.
I,
I'm just,

404
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.060
I'm just throwing this out there like this is just a,

405
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.790
and I want to host it and have all the dumb events,

406
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.080
like fucking deck guy and survivor that screams at everybody by wife always

407
00:24:11.081 --> 00:24:14.890
watches survivor.
And I just can't,
it's so fucking,
I get so much anxiety,

408
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.760
you know,
blow Teague,
slowing down.
They need to hurry up.

409
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:22.120
It's like shut the fuck up.
We know we need the dough.
You explained the game.

410
00:24:22.121 --> 00:24:25.740
You fucking shredded cunt.
Um,

411
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.500
he is in great shape for the Mana,
you know,
he's gotta be sick of it though.

412
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.160
I feel like with that guy every,
I feel like for me,

413
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.220
I feel every fucking season he gets a little more angry

414
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.920
cause at some point,

415
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:43.480
I mean it's just a finely oiled machine,

416
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:48.190
but like he sorta has stopped growing as a person because now he's stuck in

417
00:24:48.191 --> 00:24:49.480
groundhog day and it's just like,

418
00:24:49.481 --> 00:24:52.630
and they do it like they've been on the air for like 18 years and they're like

419
00:24:52.631 --> 00:24:53.830
in their 50th season,

420
00:24:53.831 --> 00:24:57.850
like I don't know how many times this poor bastard has to fly to a fucking

421
00:24:57.851 --> 00:25:02.560
island in Fiji and yell at people about,
you know,

422
00:25:02.561 --> 00:25:06.310
how they need to bring a plate of fucking piece,
you know,

423
00:25:06.311 --> 00:25:09.130
while walking on some fire,
whatever the fuck it is that that guy does.

424
00:25:09.131 --> 00:25:09.881
Can you add you just,

425
00:25:09.881 --> 00:25:13.240
just sitting there trying to think of another fucking thing that they have to
do.

426
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

427
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.270
<v 0>I Dunno.
I have no idea.</v>

428
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:24.380
It's like that American Ninja was American Ninja Warrior,

429
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:26.600
which I love that show too,
but it's just like every fight.

430
00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:30.200
I think somebody's got to sit there and think of something that requires even

431
00:25:30.201 --> 00:25:33.710
more grip strength.
I swear to God,

432
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:35.210
by the time they get in their 50 season,

433
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.740
you're gonna have to fucking be doing pull ups.

434
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.050
You're only holding on with your feet.

435
00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.380
The people who trained for that thing,
you know,
you're going to have a,

436
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:48.770
all generations are going to continue to train for that thing.
I swear to God,

437
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:51.110
our big toe is going to start sliding down the left side.

438
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:52.460
He afforded the right side of your foot,

439
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:54.500
depending on which one you're looking at,
you're going to have thumbs again,

440
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:58.640
like a fucking ape.
Um,
by the way,

441
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:03.590
I sell one of the best fucking,
uh,
youtube videos.
You know,

442
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.280
that you'd like those Mashups,
you know,
and a lot of times it's used,

443
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.770
he just picked two songs that are the same temple.
Right.

444
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:12.110
And you just fucking take the music out of one.

445
00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:14.540
You didn't take the lyrics and Gail,
you slam it together.
I know,
you know,

446
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:15.770
maybe speed it up a little bit,

447
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.160
but somebody did a rat's round and round with Marvin Gaye.

448
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:24.800
I heard it through the grapevine,
a check on the Twitter page.

449
00:26:24.801 --> 00:26:27.920
We just posted it or we have it posted by the time this is up.

450
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.200
And uh,
just the way it fits is incredible.

451
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.130
Like it actually sounds right.
Um,
and then I was,

452
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.000
I don't know what the fuck I was just on youtube looking at a bunch of videos

453
00:26:42.001 --> 00:26:43.950
and I somehow found band

454
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.060
<v 3>with this guy does this impression of Michael MacDonald and he's singing iron</v>

455
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:52.980
maiden's run to the hills,

456
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:58.490
but it's totally sung like Michael McDonald and the music that they wrote sounds

457
00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:01.410
like a Michael Mcdonald's song.

458
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.000
Like it doesn't cause I was sitting there listening going,

459
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:04.320
how the fuck I know this song?

460
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.710
<v 4>She's like a wild man
cross.</v>

461
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.070
He brought us per beer show,
Bri,

462
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.700
I won't torture you anymore.
Cuellar

463
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.273
took off.

464
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.920
I said he took a Gabe for his old knees.

465
00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.340
<v 3>You got to listen to music underneath it.</v>

466
00:27:30.341 --> 00:27:35.341
It sounds like right around the time when he was working with a steely Dan doing

467
00:27:35.651 --> 00:27:38.030
all that shit.
Um,

468
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:42.460
whoever would have thought that some bank could sit there and write some blue

469
00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:46.660
eyed soul to fucking iron maid.
All right.
With that,
let me do a little,
uh,

470
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.770
we'll post that one too.
Oh,

471
00:27:48.771 --> 00:27:51.480
probably already have it posted by the time you listen to this,
right?
All right.

472
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.000
Hang on a second.
Hang on a second.
Um,
all right.

473
00:27:55.001 --> 00:27:56.590
I can do the fucking reads here for the week.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.710
having tourettes like me hunting for raises,
shampoo and toothpaste kit.

502
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.630
Then having to play a at being a cashier,

503

office.

516
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.060
I don't understand why the post office hasn't made an offer to buy stamps.com

517
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.930
and then they just sell their locations tournament to fucking buffalo wild wings

518
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.020
or you rent them out to a corporation.
That's what you do.

519
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:55.420
And then you still own the property.
That's what the fuck I would do.

00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:56.720
Knock down a little bit of the,

the deficit from fighting these fucking nitwits who don't even have uniforms,

522
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.040
right?
You knock it down a little bit.
Okay?

Make it solving problems like Gallagher.
Um,

00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:41.800
I'm going to be making this sick ass fucking poster for all my big tornadoes

this year.

turn in half a century old.

Yoga.
Huge Sharif for no goddamn leverage.
I use,

539
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.040
I use stamps.com.
Yeah.
Whenever I send out my fucking posters,
I just said that.

540
00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:02.170
And right now you too can enjoy the stamps.com servers with a special offer that

541
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:07.030

All right.

542
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.160
Oh my God.
Speaking to Vietnam,
speaking,

543
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:18.030
speaking of Vietnam bike mechanic from Vietnam,

544
00:32:18.581 --> 00:32:22.180
how fucking weird is that?
You know,
who would have thought?

545
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:26.320
Who would have thunk that?
I would talk about Ken Burns' Vietnam by the way.

546
00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.390
I have to watch her.
You get a Ken Burns,
I swear to God,

547
00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:32.900
Ken Burns could do a fucking nine part documentary on clipping your Goddamn

548
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.490
toenails.
And I would watch that.
All right.
Cause he would somehow,

549
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.050
it would be fascinating.
And speaking of,
uh,

550
00:32:40.051 --> 00:32:43.860
amazing television that I watched when I was on the plane,
uh,

551
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.810
let me make sure I get the name of the show right.

552
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.040
I watched that new Mike Judge animated show.

553
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.530
Uh,
what is it?

554
00:32:52.531 --> 00:32:56.330
A tour bus from the tour bus have,

555
00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.960
has anybody watched that yet?

556
00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:03.620
He basically talks to all these fucking lunatic outlaw country singers.

557
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.620
Okay.
And they tell stories about being out on the road.
I,
I,
I don't,
I,

558
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.080
I yet to go.

559
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.860
I've got to see one with somebody didn't pull a gun on somebody.

560
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:20.450
Three out of four that I watched the people involved actually shot the other

561
00:33:20.451 --> 00:33:23.750
person.
One got off,
one went to jail.

562
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.490
I'm telling you
the ones I watched,

563
00:33:28.491 --> 00:33:32.690
I watched the Jerry Lee Lewis,
Johnny paycheck.

564
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.260
And then there was this guy Billy Joe something or rather,

565
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:40.040
and there was one other one that I watched.
They were unbelievable.
And you know,

566
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:41.810
if Mike Judge is doing,
it's going to be quality.

567
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:46.730
It may be percent butthead office space.
Uh,
um,

568
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.770
oh,
it's Christ.
What's the name of this?

569
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:50.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

570
00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.900
<v 3>King of the hill.
Jesus Christ.
My brain's going,
I'm going to mush.</v>

571
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:58.460
Idiocracy which a lot of people didn't see.
Um,
cause it went straight to fucking,

572
00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:02.410
you know,
this is a little too accurate.
Um,
anyways,
I,

573
00:34:02.411 --> 00:34:07.280
I cannot say enough about that show.
I have to watch every fucking one of those.

574
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.810
Um,
and you're really seeing like,

575
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.300
<v 1>okay,</v>

576
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.590
<v 3>basically an America that no longer exists.
Half the shit that they do.
It's like,</v>

577
00:34:17.591 --> 00:34:19.540
dude,
there's no fucking way you could do that now.

578
00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.610
Just with all the cell phone cameras and all of that and um,

579
00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:27.790
and you just peer into the way.

580
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:29.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

581
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.600
<v 3>Uh,
I dunno the way men,</v>

582
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:37.150
an extreme version of an American male thought back in the day,

583
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.960
the way they handled shit.
Fifth thought process.

584
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.710
It just was just,
ah,
I can't even be like,

585
00:34:43.711 --> 00:34:46.660
get on like 20 different fucking levels.
That show is unbelievable.

586
00:34:46.661 --> 00:34:47.550
You have to watch it.

587
00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:53.080
The guys on his team got one of these,
I'll ruin one thing.

588
00:34:53.081 --> 00:34:56.770
This guy is on trial for shooting this guy in the face.

589
00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.480
Okay.
And the judge goes,
well,

590
00:35:01.481 --> 00:35:05.680
couldn't you just ran away or walked away saying he didn't have to do it?

591
00:35:05.681 --> 00:35:10.150
Basically.
And the guy looks at the judge,
he's like,
he's like,
buddy,

592
00:35:10.151 --> 00:35:15.130
I'm from Texas.
We don't run.
Says that his own fucking trial.

593
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:21.250
Uh,
anyways,
I don't know.
I'm butchering it.
You got to see it.

594
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:26.020
The part we're fucking Jerry Lee Lewis considers driving over Liberace.

595
00:35:26.021 --> 00:35:29.950
So there'd be quote,
one less piano play in motherfucker that he had to compete,

596
00:35:29.951 --> 00:35:34.270
compete with.
Just imagine that animated.

597
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.090
That's I,
I,
it's,
it's incredible show,
incredible show.

598
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.960
And I resent every podcast listener for not telling me that it existed.

599
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.250
You probably did.
I just miss the emails.
All right.
Okay.
Here we go.

600
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.450
Bike mechanic from Vietnam.
Hey there,

601
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.370
mister Billie old rice ball.

602
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:57.540
I found your podcast last year and had been listening ever since.

603
00:35:57.541 --> 00:36:01.130
I'm currently a bike mechanic at a local shop here in her noise,

604
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.650
Vietnamese born and raised.
Well,
I bet you get a ton of work.

605
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.530
Everybody rides bikes over there.
Right?

606
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.510
And I'm basing that on Hollywood movies that I've seen.
All right.

607
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.820
Um,
actually Tom Rhodes always does gigs over there and tells me how beautiful it

608
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:20.220
is.
And Tom Rhodes is going to be in Vietnam.

609
00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:24.000
He was telling me and the next couple of months,
I believe,
at least this year,

610
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.310
I forget what the date is.
Uh,
all right.

611
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.480
I recently met the loveliest Colombian lady.
Oh,
they're beautiful,

612
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.320
beautiful women in the world at the shop.
And I am smitten.

613
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.580
I don't doubt it.

614
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:40.170
Problem is she's only gonna be here for one month before continuing to the next

615
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:41.700
destination.
On a world tour.

616
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:46.530
And what better time for you to get in there between those dyes?
Um,

617
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.270
I'm sorry.
Have a nice romance.
Uh,

618
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:55.890
she's covering from my fellow coworker who's on a trip of her own traveling

619
00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:59.070
across the country.
I'm happy enough to have a month to spend with her.

620
00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:01.470
I don't care if she's going to be gone forever afterwards.

621
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:06.030
I have no idea what to do though.
Always have been with women.
I've got no game.

622
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:10.410
I'm always a bit needy.
Oh,
that's a bad one.
Not,
no one wants to say it's easy.

623
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.830
That's easy.
You just,
you got to start bombing like a comedian.

624
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.460
Like the way a person learns how to become a comedian.
You just write some shit.

625
00:37:17.461 --> 00:37:21.360
You don't know if it's funny,
you go up there,
you fucking,
you know,

626
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.890
lose on nine out of 10.

627
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:27.030
But You keep that one and you build off of that and then eventually you have an

628
00:37:27.031 --> 00:37:31.410
act.
All right.
Needy.
He can't be needy.

629
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:37.110
I'm a bit needy and I'm constantly doubting myself.
Um,
all right,
well I'm,

630
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:39.540
I'm with you on the second one.
Uh,

631
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.300
and whether or not she likes me.

632
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.640
I know it's a good thing to do and I should stop thinking that way,

633
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.290
but it's not easy for me.
I guess I need some words of advice and encouragement.

634
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.730
A stank you very much and go hug yourself.
Um,

635
00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.720
uh,
I would just,
you just,
you just gotta like

636
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.700
the thing about doubting yourself and being needy and all of that and just being

637
00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:15.090
filled with doubt and no confidence is that is,
um,

638
00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.780
that's one of those things where when you're really young,

639
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.940
the sooner you address that,
the better your life is going to be.

640
00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

641
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.540
<v 3>Okay.
Because that</v>

642
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.100
you're so young at this point that it's not,
I don't think it's,

643
00:38:33.101 --> 00:38:34.750
it just doesn't happen.
It's a mid senior,

644
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.050
like if you try to deal with it and your late thirties,
the way I did.
So,
uh,

645
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.180
and then you find out all this shit you were afraid of that you thought was,

646
00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.080
I've got to walk up this fucking mountain.
It's was these,

647
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.880
it was like stepping up onto a curb.

648
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.490
So first of all,
in a good way,
who gives a fuck?

649
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.590
If you asked this checkout and she shoots you down,
who gives a fuck you,

650
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:02.400
all you have is a funny fucking story.
And in a,

651
00:39:02.401 --> 00:39:05.410
in an experience asking a woman out,

652
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.120
especially if you think she's out of,
out of your league,
that's even better.

653
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.330
You know,
anything you want to do,
you got it.

654
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:15.580
You got to play with people that are better than you.

655
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.850
If you want to get better playing sports,
you know,

656
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:21.940
like I remember this guy was telling me about as far as like getting together,

657
00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:24.550
if you play an instrument jamming with people,
buy when we were kids,

658
00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.920
it goes always to be like a,
hey we should jam.

659
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.440
Well how long have you been playing?
I've been playing for years.

660
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.230
I've only been playing a year.
I can't play a,
you can be too good.
It's like,
no,

661
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:35.470
you should go play with them cause they're gonna they're gonna pull you up.

662
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.430
Alright,
so it's the same thing with this thing.

663
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.360
You've got this beautiful Colombian woman,
she's going to be leaving soon.

664
00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:47.560
So first of all,
the fact that this going to be no relationship beyond this.

665
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.570
There's going to be no pressure.

666
00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:54.100
So the level of fun that you guys can have is going to be ridiculous.
So,
um,

667
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:55.810
<v 1>okay.</v>

668
00:39:55.810 --> 00:40:00.070
<v 3>I would just start hitting on her personally.
Just make subtle comments.</v>

669
00:40:00.071 --> 00:40:04.150
Just tell us you whatever she's wearing and tell her she looks good.
She has got,

670
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.080
I don't know,
should I wear this?

671
00:40:05.081 --> 00:40:07.910
I know you always feel you look good and everything.
Really.
Yeah,

672
00:40:07.911 --> 00:40:11.170
I think you're beautiful.
Just like that and fuck all these fucking women.

673
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:15.820
Two of them.
Good.
Who,
who center at work?
Fuck off.
Okay.

674
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:18.940
He's a guy he ate at some point.

675
00:40:18.941 --> 00:40:23.290
He has to get off the wall and try and make something happen.
Okay.

676
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:26.500
It'd be one thing if women hit on guys and we could sit there and be like,

677
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:31.410
don't talk about my pecs like that.
God stopped complimenting me.
Um,

678
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.790
I'm not saying to be a creep.
All right?

679
00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:38.010
But you got to let her know that you like her.
So,
uh,

680
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:39.710
<v 1>okay.</v>

681
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:44.030
<v 3>I,
that's what I would do.
I would just compliment her,
make her laugh.</v>

682
00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.910
Be just,
be in a good,
just be funny,
chill fucking person.

683
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:55.530
All right.
Don't be overly aggressive,
don't be fucking needy.

684
00:40:55.531 --> 00:40:59.040
All of that Shit freaks him the fuck out.
Just freaks him out.

685
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:02.880
They run in the other fucking direction.
So,
um,
I dunno,

686
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.770
I dunno if you've got a sense of humor or whatever.

687
00:41:04.771 --> 00:41:08.520
It seems like you do the way you wrote this shit and a lot of people that are

688
00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:12.840
needy and n n doubt those cells are funny people.

689
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.490
Okay,
so I need to compliment her.
Be a little self deprecating about yourself.

690
00:41:17.491 --> 00:41:19.800
Then she goes,
no,
I think he looked good and blah,
blah blah.

691
00:41:19.801 --> 00:41:22.710
And then she takes a step in your direction and then just fucking go from there.

692
00:41:22.711 --> 00:41:24.330
And then just one day,
just look at it.
Say,
hey listen,

693
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.750
I know you're only going to be here for like a month,
but I really like you.

694
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.720
I think you're beautiful and I'd love to go out with you.
Let's go hang out.

695
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:35.480
Let's go do something.
I'll fucking,
I'll had pile of shit over there.

696
00:41:35.481 --> 00:41:38.330
I'll turn that into a bicycle,
puts you on the handlebars or drive around.

697
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:43.160
Go see a movie or some shit.
Who gives a fuck what she says.

698
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.210
I'll tell you what you,
if she says no,

699
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.940
that is going to hurt way less than for the rest of your fucking life.

700
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:50.601
Sitting there going,

701
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:54.140
you know what a fucking anybody trying to fucking ass that Colombian checkout.

702
00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

703
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.950
<v 3>That,
that lasts a lifetime.</v>

704
00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:00.100
A woman shooting you down like all you gotta do get how long that lasts,

705
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:05.101
that lasts as long as however long it takes to call one of your friends to tell

706
00:42:05.681 --> 00:42:10.600
him the funny story.
Back when I started off as a comedian,

707
00:42:10.601 --> 00:42:15.601
I swear to God I was bombing so much that it got to the point while I was

708
00:42:15.611 --> 00:42:16.031
bombing,

709
00:42:16.031 --> 00:42:19.540
I was already thinking about calling Patrice and telling them the story and

710
00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:20.620
listening to him laugh at me.

711
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:24.010
Cause it used to always make me feel better or Dane or Bobby or any of those

712
00:42:24.011 --> 00:42:29.011
other guys that I started out with and like all the humiliation,

713
00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.060
I was almost like,
oh,
good on bombing.

714
00:42:31.061 --> 00:42:34.540
I have a funny story to tell those other guys and it stopped being like a

715
00:42:34.541 --> 00:42:37.240
negative thing.
Um,
so there you go.

716
00:42:37.241 --> 00:42:41.380
I don't want to fucking oversell you on this ship,
but a good for you.

717
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:42.671
You're young,

718
00:42:42.671 --> 00:42:45.310
you're in a beautiful country and a beautiful woman's going to be there for a

719
00:42:45.311 --> 00:42:49.960
month.
Fucking a,
you're supposed to have fun.
All right,
so there you go.

720
00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.950
Good luck to you sir.
All right.

721
00:42:53.951 --> 00:42:58.420
Selma and Louise.
All right.
I mentioned last,
uh,

722
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:03.480
last podcast that me and Nia sat down and watched that movie and how incredible

723
00:43:03.641 --> 00:43:06.340
a movie that is.
How poignant it is.
Now.

724
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.200
You could almost look at a Thelma and Louise,

725
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:11.260
like it was warning all of these people now they've got these youtube fucking

726
00:43:11.261 --> 00:43:15.580
cases,
um,
that they had fucking had enough and that they're the sick cause every,

727
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.680
it's every literally every like strain of different types of creepy guy or lying

728
00:43:21.551 --> 00:43:24.970
or whatever the fuck you want to call it.
And uh,
held up really well.

729
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.110
And then I was talking about that Crystal Mcdonald,
who plays Darryl quit

730
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.130
<v 2>that guy.
Um,</v>

731
00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.950
<v 3>just blew me away.
All right.
He said,
Bill,</v>

732
00:43:37.951 --> 00:43:40.840
regarding your mention of filming Louise on the March 12th,

733
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.180
Monday morning podcast.

734
00:43:42.181 --> 00:43:46.830
A couple of things I learned about that movie from the book off the cliff.

735
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.040
How the making of film in Louise Drove Hollywood to the edge by Becky Aikman

736
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.450
drove it to the edge.
I don't know about that.
Uh,

737
00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.790
the movie was almost made with Jodie foster and Michelle Pfeiffer in the lead

738
00:44:02.791 --> 00:44:05.070
roles.
Is that amazing?

739
00:44:05.071 --> 00:44:09.090
After they cast it and then you try to picture new people in there and you like

740
00:44:09.091 --> 00:44:13.910
that one to work,
you know,
both of them incredible actresses.
You like that?
Why?

741
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.240
Why the fuck would you put them in there?

742
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.120
A Crystal Mcdonald who played Delmas husband.

743
00:44:18.121 --> 00:44:21.600
Darryl has been engaged to Gina Davis at one time.

744
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.250
<v 2>Okay.</v>

745
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.620
<v 3>A few years before the movie.
Oh Wow.</v>

746
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:29.790
He also nearly stole the movie by improvising a lot of his role,

747
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.570
much to the amusement of director Ridley Scott.
Yeah,
I thought he was,

748
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.630
if you watch Harvey Keitel,
he's literally just laughing

749
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.360
when watching the,
uh,
what's,
this guy's doing?
A three.

750
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:46.710
The role of hunky cowboy originally went to Stephen Baldwin.

751
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:50.490
I didn't know that.
Who backed out at the last second to be in backdraft.

752
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.580
That's understandable.
I'd probably get a bigger role.

753
00:44:53.581 --> 00:44:58.581
Five actors were brought back to audition with Gina Davis for Brunettes and an

754
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:05.370
unknown blonde named Brad Pitt Davis loved pit and he ended up getting the job.

755
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:10.020
Years later,
Davis found herself on a plane seated next to George Clooney.

756
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.910
Clooney made a comment about Pitt stealing a role from him when they were both

757
00:45:14.911 --> 00:45:19.420
getting started in the business.
Turns out it was the Thelma and Louise Park.

758
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:23.400
No Way.
I love this shit.
We should do more of this on the podcast.

759
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.930
George was one of the four brunettes and Davis had never known it.

760
00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.170
Wow.
What the fuck airline is that?

761
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.570
It's definitely not southwest crew beak.
I can tell you that right now.
All right.

762
00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:41.460
Also just saw the Ricky Gervais',
Netflix specials,
humanity in it.

763
00:45:41.461 --> 00:45:45.330
He has a nice bit after the 40 minute mark about intolerance,

764
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.040
especially related to comedy.

765
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:51.630
There's another segment right after the one hour mark where he discusses rape

766
00:45:51.631 --> 00:45:55.860
jokes and people's reaction to them would have crossed the border to see you in

767
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:58.680
Kitchener,
uh,
tonight.

768
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:03.710
But after all it is Saint Patrick's day and there are bar crawls and drinking

769
00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:08.150
etiquettes to be observed.
Aaron go bra,
you Ella Vena,

770
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:11.550
you albino fucking Leprechaun.
I fucked that up.
That's Aaron go bra.

771
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:14.220
You Alab you albino Leprechaun.

772
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.890
Uh,
anyways,
oh,
you know something.

773
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.920
I actually learned a lot about Kitchener cause I was asking him,
I go,

774
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:26.220
what did you guys use to make here that just had that vibe and they all left.

775
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.240
And uh,

776
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.300
I guess that was the place where they used to make crown royal to Seagram's

777
00:46:32.851 --> 00:46:36.360
family was from there.
And Joe Barton,
nick,
um,

778
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.140
who should be on their wall of fame has said,

779
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:44.010
he said he's thrown out at least 400 of those purple bags in his lifetime.

780
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.860
Um,
they also make,

781
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.440
um,
the best striper,
striper,

782
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:57.510
the best sniper rifles in the world where you can basically be deadly accurate

783
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:02.580
from two and a half miles away.
And I was joking about that,

784
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:07.410
like the power of that,
like how relaxed you could be,
you know what I mean?

785
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.480
You're two and a half miles away from the mercy you cell phones there.

786
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.240
So he just couldn't be like,
yeah,
I wasn't there.
Check out my cell phone.

787
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.070
You know,

788
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.980
all you do is put a silencer on the end of the fucking thing and you just start

789
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:23.760
talking to one of your friends and then you just look in two and a half miles

790
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:26.500
down the road at this mother is that son of a bitch right here.

791
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:32.950
You got the gun half disassembled by the time he fucking hits the guy and you go

792
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.740
perfect fucking murder.
I,
you know,
it's funny.

793
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:40.000
All these gun nuts are going to write in.

794
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.700
Oh actually they be able to trace the bullet and they would,
you know,

795
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:46.690
Redo the sheer numbers on the gun shot up,
joke.
It's a fucking joke.

796
00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:48.243
Um,

797
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.230
<v 1>okay.</v>

798
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.980
<v 3>Anyways,
you know what's great about Saint Patrick's Day was,</v>

799
00:47:51.981 --> 00:47:54.470
I wasn't even aware there was Saint Patrick's day when it did the kitchen,

800
00:47:54.471 --> 00:47:57.920
her gig and we drove all the way back and then we partied at this place called

801
00:47:57.921 --> 00:48:00.800
the bill Hicks Bar and you're going to the bathroom.

802
00:48:00.801 --> 00:48:05.570
They had all these quotes of uh,
you know,
Bill Hicks on the wall.

803
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.890
Those.
It was a bunch of standup comics hanging out there and we had a great time

804
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:14.300
because we reached out and we try to find a place where we could actually hang

805
00:48:14.301 --> 00:48:17.390
out and drink some nonalcoholic beers.

806
00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.990
And we want to thank everybody there at the,
uh,

807
00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:25.520
sober bill Hicks Bar for letting us act like gentlemen.
Um,

808
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.320
all right,
Bill.

809
00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:32.300
I'm a 20 year old and I lost my older girlfriend who has kids.

810
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:36.700
Ah,
congratulations.
This.

811
00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.270
This is a fucking,
this is a problem.

812
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:43.280
Hey Bill,

813
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.180
I've been a fan for a while and I know you have plenty of advice in that shiny

814
00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:51.440
head or you're
not saying any of you.
It's good or professional.

815
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.800
For the last four months I've really been beating myself up because I didn't,

816
00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:02.270
I didn't stand up for myself and I let the most amazing girl I've ever met go

817
00:49:02.271 --> 00:49:05.810
back to her ex because I didn't think I could support her and her two kids.

818
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.890
I've had many girlfriends before,
Dude,

819
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:13.370
you 20 before her.
And I've been sad about a breakup,

820
00:49:13.371 --> 00:49:14.330
but not like this.

821
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:19.220
I was drinking heavily and taking pain pills do don't do that because I know I

822
00:49:19.221 --> 00:49:22.880
can't have her back.
I don't know how to move forward from here.

823
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:27.260
I've gotten myself off the pills great.
And I've cut down on the drinking,

824
00:49:27.261 --> 00:49:29.720
but I can't seem to feel anything for any other girl.

825
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:34.550
I just don't really have any drive without her.
What should I do now?
Thanks.

826
00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:38.510
Even if you don't get around to this,
um,
first of all,
forgive yourself.

827
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.520
All right?
There's not a person out there,
all right?

828
00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:49.040
That hasn't fucking fucked up a relationship unless you just marry the first

829
00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:52.040
person that you're with.
You know,

830
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.960
like they used to do back in the turn of last century.
Hey,
I do.
I mean,

831
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
I fucked up like three before I found Nia just really fucked him up and thought

832
00:50:02.571 --> 00:50:06.080
I'd never get past.
I mean,
you know,
like you do,
this is a great time for you,

833
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:11.060
okay?
Because you're,
what you're learning to do is pick yourself up off the mat.

834
00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.930
Do you remember?
Were you ever see that George Foreman fight when he fights Ali?

835
00:50:14.931 --> 00:50:19.931
And he goes down and decades later they asked him about being down on the canvas

836
00:50:20.931 --> 00:50:23.570
and he said,
you know what?
You know what the truth is?
He goes,

837
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.470
I could have got up.
I just never been there before.
All right.

838
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.960
And after that,
look at him.

839
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.630
The guy came back when he was like in his forties and won the fucking

840
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:36.920
heavyweight title.
Um,
so look,

841
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:40.460
it's the first time you've been knocked on your ass like this and this is great.

842
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:44.140
You're going to learn something from it.
And uh,

843
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.070
you're single and you know what?

844
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.830
The fact that she can't feel anything about anybody else knew it was because

845
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.710
you're a good person.
You actually have feelings for this other person.

846
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:56.060
So what you do is you just fucking go out,
hang with your friends,

847
00:50:56.061 --> 00:50:59.600
have a good time.
If you meet some chick asked,
she asked you what your deal is.

848
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:04.040
Say I just went through a bad breakup.
Blahblahblahblahblah and I swear to God,

849
00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.020
they'll,
they'll want to cheer you up so much.

850
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:08.450
You probably get a fucking blow job out of it.
I'm telling you,

851
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.580
they love a fucking fixer upper.
They love a little sad god damn face.

852
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:18.860
Just say a fucked up a relationship and I'm heartbroken about it.

853
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:20.120
What's going on with you?

854
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:22.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

855
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.910
<v 3>As opposed to fucking,
you know,</v>

856
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.910
leading them on and acting like you liked them and then they find out you're

857
00:51:26.911 --> 00:51:28.050
hung up on some other girl.

858
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.880
That's when they get mad and fucking do to destruction of property,

859
00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.920
not get prosecuted for it.
You know,

860
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:38.190
it's actually a commercial out right now with this woman's just breaking this

861
00:51:38.191 --> 00:51:41.970
guy shit thrown it out the window.
Like that's totally fucking fine,

862
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.470
you know?
I don't understand that at all.
So that's what I would say.
Okay,
buddy.

863
00:51:46.471 --> 00:51:48.930
I got to be honest with you.
Okay?
I know she's great and everything,

864
00:51:48.931 --> 00:51:50.910
but she's older than you and she has kids.

865
00:51:50.911 --> 00:51:54.570
That's a hell of a fucking thing to paratroop into.
All right.

866
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:56.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

867
00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.060
<v 3>Just Sunday,
you're going to meet another one.</v>

868
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:03.800
You're going to find the real fucking thing.
All right?
And you know,

869
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:04.491
this is not going to be,
oh,

870
00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:07.700
can you support me in all my fucking kids that I had with somebody else?

871
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.880
Or I'm going to go back to that guy that sounds like a fucking country song yet,

872
00:52:10.881 --> 00:52:14.390
Dude,
you don't need that shit.
You're going to find some fucking girl.

873
00:52:14.391 --> 00:52:18.230
You're going to,
who knows,
a year from now,
two years from now,
three,
four years,

874
00:52:18.231 --> 00:52:20.900
whatever.
You're going to find the fucking love of your life,
okay?

875
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:21.531
And you know what?

876
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:25.550
You're going to wish you dead someday during the time before your matter is

877
00:52:25.551 --> 00:52:29.120
fucking went out and had a good time and bagged everything you possibly fucking

878
00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:33.200
could,
but then fucking reason consensually with a condom there.

879
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:37.100
Did I say it right?
Go out and have a great fucking time.

880
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.630
Enjoy your fucking life.

881
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.060
Because someday you're going to make the girl your dreams,

882
00:52:43.061 --> 00:52:45.400
the person you're supposed to be with.
All right?

883
00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.680
And you're going to get married and you're going to have a kid.

884
00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:49.870
And then even though you love all of them and everything,

885
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:53.390
you know your podcast is going to be late cause you gotta go.

886
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.290
You gotta go down to the east of buddy,
you got to do what?

887
00:52:56.291 --> 00:52:59.050
You can't miss that shit and all your free time is going to be gone.

888
00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.630
It's not going to be a bad thing because you're going to love the kids so much.

889
00:53:01.631 --> 00:53:05.560
However you are going to think back to a lot of the free time he had thick of

890
00:53:05.561 --> 00:53:08.530
Jesus Christ.
Why the fuck didn't I do this and that?

891
00:53:08.531 --> 00:53:11.260
So all this woman did was give you a great opportunity to go out and fucking

892
00:53:11.261 --> 00:53:15.280
enjoy yourself.
All right?
And when nobody's looking,

893
00:53:15.281 --> 00:53:19.020
put your face in the pillow and fucking cry it out of you.
Do it every day.

894
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:21.460
That's what they do.
You got to,
you got to cry yourself.

895
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:23.260
They never tell guys to do that,
right?

896
00:53:23.261 --> 00:53:27.790
Cry Yourself into forgive yourself and all of that shit.
In the meantime,

897
00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:32.140
have a great fucking time.
All right,
go get a kegerator.

898
00:53:32.141 --> 00:53:34.810
Watch a little march madness.
Go to the gym,
get in great shape.

899
00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:37.240
There's all kinds of positive things you can do.
All right,

900
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:41.860
wife cheated on me night before our wedding.
Oh boy.

901
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:47.260
Oh boy.
The next one is fucked.
My roommate's sister,

902
00:53:47.261 --> 00:53:51.350
Jesus Christ.
Fucking an said,

903
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.530
listen to this podcast.
Um,

904
00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:59.270
it's almost like I attract them with my own ignorance.
All right.

905
00:53:59.271 --> 00:54:03.080
Wife cheated on me night before our wedding.
Dear Billy hotlips,

906
00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:07.670
my wife and I have been happily married for 13 years.
We live in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.

907
00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.600
Well,
not to get selfish,
share with your extremely painful story,

908
00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:14.870
but I'm going to be in,
I'm going to be at the Brady theater and Tulsa,

909
00:54:14.871 --> 00:54:18.230
Oklahoma coming in the next few months.
Okay.
All right.

910
00:54:18.231 --> 00:54:21.380
Where are we met at the University of,
I'm not gonna say the university,
Kate.

911
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:24.520
That we have two children ages 10 and seven.
Okay.

912
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:26.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

913
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.600
<v 3>And have a really comfortable life together.</v>

914
00:54:27.601 --> 00:54:30.480
The other night it took my wife out for a date night dinner and bowling.

915
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:34.260
The bowling sounds lame,
but remember it's Tulsa.
Do Bowling is the shit

916
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:38.490
you get in the league.
It's fucking awesome.
Anyways,

917
00:54:38.491 --> 00:54:42.110
my wife and I went up to the bar at the bowling alley and when the bartenders

918
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:46.350
saw her,
he gave her a weird looks sorta like cabin.
I met you before.

919
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:47.780
<v 2>Okay.</v>

920
00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:52.580
<v 3>After taking our order.
He came back with drinks and said,
enjoy Mitzi.</v>

921
00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:56.930
I was shocked when he knew her name and I gave my wife a puzzled look.

922
00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:01.370
We took the drinks and went back to our lane and I asked her how he could know

923
00:55:01.371 --> 00:55:02.204
her name.

924
00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:07.420
She said she has no idea and checked her shirt as if for some reason she was

925
00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.680
wearing a name tag.

926
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:11.010
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

927
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:14.070
<v 3>After a few minutes when she couldn't think of an excuse or a lie,</v>

928
00:55:14.071 --> 00:55:15.570
she dropped a bomb on me.

929
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:20.700
She told me that he was the bartender from the hotel where we had our wedding

930
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:25.620
reception.
She said the night before our wedding,
after our rehearsal dinner,

931
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:29.970
her and her bridesmaids went to the hotel to sleep and stopped at the lobby bar

932
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:34.170
for a couple of drinks.
Everyone then went up to bed,
but my wife,

933
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.440
I are good friends,
but Paul,
everyone over to Belmont,

934
00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:40.710
but my wife snuck down to go talk to the bartender.
Oh wait a minute.

935
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:45.450
My apologies to her friends.
She told him that she's getting married tomorrow,

936
00:55:45.451 --> 00:55:49.260
but once one more night with another man before giving herself to me.

937
00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.190
So she took him up to the honeymoon suite and had sex with them,

938
00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.140
which by the way is the same bed that we consummated our marriage and the next

939
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.160
night.
Oh God.
Yeah.

940
00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.740
She told me she was never going to tell me because it meant nothing more than

941
00:56:05.741 --> 00:56:10.240
her wanting to enter a single life with a bang,
not a whimper.
Literally a bank.

942
00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.710
She claims she has never had doubts about us and that she's sorry that I found

943
00:56:14.711 --> 00:56:15.460
out,

944
00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:19.750
but she doesn't regret the cheating because it assures her that she had found

945
00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:20.643
the guy.

946
00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>

947
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.240
<v 3>Who she wants to be forever.
Yeah,
buddy.</v>

948
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:27.240
<v 2>You try the same thing and then tell her that hey,
it meant nothing.</v>

949
00:56:27.241 --> 00:56:30.570
And when I was banging her I was like,
you know I,
yeah.
Yay.

950
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.210
And with the right broad,
after hearing this,

951
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:38.070
I asked if she could get cheated since we've been married and she said no,

952
00:56:38.071 --> 00:56:42.150
which I believe we left the bowling alley and drove home in bitters.
Silence.

953
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:43.950
I've not spoken to her.

954
00:56:43.951 --> 00:56:48.420
And about a week now other than when it pertains to the kids and other important

955
00:56:48.421 --> 00:56:49.254
matters,

956
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.200
she's been sleeping in the guest room because she knows I don't want to be

957
00:56:52.201 --> 00:56:55.350
around her.
However,
I know I need to confront her about this,

958
00:56:55.351 --> 00:56:57.810
but I am unsure how to go about it.

959
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.160
I think the only scenarios are divorced or basically accepting and forgiving,

960
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:06.720
neither of which I want to do at this moment.
What she's,
you're fucking right.

961
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.190
I'm not telling any of my family or friends about this because I'm embarrassed.

962
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:14.880
So I'm hoping you can give advice,
love the podcast and go fuck yourself.

963
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:18.130
I tell her exactly what you just told me.
Okay.

964
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.190
<v 3>Just say that the only two possible scenarios here or divorce or me accepting</v>

965
00:57:23.191 --> 00:57:27.480
and forgiving,
but I'm not ready to do either one at this moment.
Okay.

966
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:31.350
And you're going to have to accept that and my mood around you because of your

967
00:57:31.351 --> 00:57:33.900
actions.
All right?
And by the way,

968
00:57:33.901 --> 00:57:36.750
I'm not telling any of my family and friends about this because I'm so

969
00:57:36.751 --> 00:57:40.920
embarrassed.
Okay.

970
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:42.870
And um,

971
00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.830
then I would recommend going to some sort of couple's therapy.

972
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:48.240
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

973
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.930
<v 3>Because that is a mind fuck beyond,
um,</v>

974
00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:56.400
any of my bar room fucking advice.

975
00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.200
But uh,

976
00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.310
you seem pretty well emotionally where you know exactly what you're feeling and

977
00:58:02.311 --> 00:58:05.310
why you're feeling it.
I would just communicate it to her.

978
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.313
<v 0>MMM.</v>

979
00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.570
<v 3>And she better not Polish shit of like,</v>

980
00:58:09.571 --> 00:58:12.140
so he's just not going to talk to me from make it about herself.

981
00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.553
<v 0>MMM.</v>

982
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.713
<v 2>Okay.</v>

983
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:20.920
<v 3>I Dunno.
I think the only way,
how do you stay?</v>

984
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:22.750
I mean you gotta stay cause the kids are there,

985
00:58:22.751 --> 00:58:27.520
which is such a fucking situation.
And then,
um,

986
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:31.250
<v 2>okay.</v>

987
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:36.230
<v 3>All right.
The positive side is she actually fucking owned up to it.
Negative.</v>

988
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:39.170
She waited 13 years and two kids.
All right,

989
00:58:39.171 --> 00:58:42.230
let's not do the positive and negative because I feel like once this is going to

990
00:58:42.231 --> 00:58:46.700
be like a fucking bad super bowl here,
um,
yeah,
I dunno.

991
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:49.130
What is the solution you get to fuck somebody?

992
00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.420
<v 0>Um,
I don't know.</v>

993
00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.490
<v 3>And it sounds to me like you didn't even want to do that,</v>

994
00:58:57.491 --> 00:58:59.790
so that's not going to be a fucking solution.
I Dunno.

995
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.820
I would get professional help when you're ready to sit down and talk about it.

996
00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:05.620
Uh,

997
00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:07.960
<v 2>okay.</v>

998
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.620
<v 3>Listen,</v>

999
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:12.070
it'd be one thing if you were fucking early on in your goddamn relationship,

1000
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.250
but you were getting married the next day and then fucked in the old guy.

1001
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:19.990
You don't that in literally that bed.
I had to be honest with you,
man.

1002
00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:21.850
That's pretty hardcore.

1003
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.750
That's like guy level piece of shit behavior.
Um,

1004
00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:30.370
although women are totally capable of it,
that's just that,

1005
00:59:30.371 --> 00:59:34.300
that's not their ml because they're so good at being pieces of shit that

1006
00:59:34.301 --> 00:59:36.820
everybody thinks they're not.
We're guys,

1007
00:59:36.821 --> 00:59:40.630
we just constantly get caught with their fucking pants down.
Oh,
you shared,

1008
00:59:40.631 --> 00:59:44.920
you're going to be home later.
That's your fucking excuse.

1009
00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:49.150
Well,
I mean,
aren't you also being dishonest?

1010
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:56.430
All
right.
Fucked my roommate's sister.
Oh boy.

1011
00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:58.903
All right,

1012
00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:03.990
dear Billy barnacles fucked my roommate's sister and I now need your help.

1013
01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.331
My roommates,

1014
01:00:07.331 --> 01:00:10.090
since it's the only way I can get through these because he's just so fucking
sad.

1015
01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:15.250
My roommate's sister was in town this weekend while he was at old town.

1016
01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:19.440
Uh,
she was going to the bars with some friends and crashing on a brother's bed,

1017
01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.980
my place or what have you.

1018
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:26.730
She invited me out with her and I said,
fuck yeah.
Oh,

1019
01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:31.480
I'm paraphrasing.
You know,
she is pretty much our same age,
mid twenties,

1020
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.110
as I hung out with a lot of our,
with,
you know,

1021
01:00:35.111 --> 01:00:38.260
and how it has hung out a lot with our group of friends that I've known her for

1022
01:00:38.261 --> 01:00:39.500
five years now.

1023
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:44.501
And consider a friend outside of just my friend's sister is how I justify what

1024
01:00:44.621 --> 01:00:47.610
the fuck I did at the end of this ladder.
Uh,

1025
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.260
so I figured what the hell,

1026
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.710
maybe she could be a good wing man.

1027
01:00:53.711 --> 01:00:55.930
I could hit it off with what was one of her friends.

1028
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.590
Unfortunately that wasn't what happened.
I ain't near,
just walked in.
Nia,

1029
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.680
this guy just found out
he went,

1030
01:01:05.681 --> 01:01:08.800
he was at a bowling alleys in a bowling league with his wife or whatever.

1031
01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.230
Then there are balling.
Can I just ask the question,

1032
01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.740
was that your attempted a southern accent or what was that?

1033
01:01:14.741 --> 01:01:17.140
That you were just doing?
Oh,
it's because these are so sad.

1034
01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:19.270
I just have to do it in a silly accident because I want to hear it.

1035
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:24.160
Was that a bad accent?
Yeah.
No,
it isn't.
It's a funny accent.
Okay.
I mean,
yeah.

1036
01:01:24.161 --> 01:01:28.300
Funny.
I'm not trying to like be like legitimately,
oh Jesus fucking Christ.

1037
01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:33.410
I came and making fun of you.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I did high

1038
01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.910
criticism.
It never ends.
Let's a,
that's your idea of a,
yeah.

1039
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.730
Yeah.
I'm giving you shit.
Okay.
I just seem like I'm in the podcast.

1040
01:01:43.731 --> 01:01:47.330
Why are you being so sun symbol?
Because it sounded like you were serious.
Oh,
see,

1041
01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:50.540
now you're on Instagram.
You're going to get all like weird about stuff,
man.

1042
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.450
I don't even know that.
I tell you right now,
I can't even,

1043
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:57.690
I don't even understand Instagram,
what we were at all the whores.

1044
01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:02.400
What were all the Instagram whore is all I get is just shit from a people that I

1045
01:02:02.401 --> 01:02:06.630
know it.
Do you want to be following Instagram models?
I want to see him.

1046
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:11.700
Well,
I'm sure after this people will send you loads of land.
Well,

1047
01:02:11.701 --> 01:02:15.270
you can't have the ones you look at.
Who do I give these shoes?
Radio,

1048
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:19.070
shoot all of those tits hanging out.
Oh.
Um,
so this,

1049
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:20.300
he's out bowling

1050
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.440
<v 0>is Tanea is your fucking ice coffee big enough for you?</v>

1051
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.230
<v 3>It's a smoothie and it's this,
this is a regular size.</v>

1052
01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.300
<v 0>I love you all.
You guys who drink smoothies to lose weight.</v>

1053
01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:35.650
It's like a giant chocolate shake.
I'm not,
this is not obviously to lose weight,

1054
01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.000
I just want,
I wanted a nice natural fucking drag.
Do we need to start again?

1055
01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.280
I guess I,
we're getting off on the wrong.

1056
01:02:42.281 --> 01:02:45.610
So this fucking guy goes out to bowl a bowl and I've been married 13 years.

1057
01:02:45.611 --> 01:02:46.361
He's got two kids,

1058
01:02:46.361 --> 01:02:49.300
like a 10 year old and a fucking seven or eight year old or something like that.

1059
01:02:49.301 --> 01:02:50.134
Right?

1060
01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.730
So they're Bolin and I go up to get some drinks and said when they went up there

1061
01:02:54.731 --> 01:02:58.060
that the bartender kind of gave his wife a weird look.

1062
01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:02.440
And then when he gave the drinks to her,
he said,
hey,
have a good night.
Mitzi,

1063
01:03:02.441 --> 01:03:05.650
like newer name.
So they go back over and he goes,

1064
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:08.350
how the fuck did he know your name?

1065
01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.740
And she acted dumbfounded to the point of actually pretending to look for a name

1066
01:03:11.741 --> 01:03:14.770
on a shirt.
I don't know.
And then she just couldn't come up with a good line.

1067
01:03:14.771 --> 01:03:19.120
She finally just said the night before their wedding,
she banged the gay.

1068
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:26.010
Oh,
but hasn't bagged anyone since she goes,
oh,

1069
01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.220
she said her and her friends were downstairs in the hotel lobby drinking.

1070
01:03:30.221 --> 01:03:34.030
They all went to bed and a night she snuck down and told the bartender she

1071
01:03:34.031 --> 01:03:35.350
wanted one last bang,

1072
01:03:35.351 --> 01:03:38.920
literally before she got married and went up to the honeymoon suite where they

1073
01:03:38.921 --> 01:03:43.460
consummated their marriage the next night and fuck that guy in that bed.
Oh Ooh,

1074
01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.570
<v 3>Mitzi,
you are a dirty dog.</v>

1075
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.710
<v 0>And then claimed that she never did anything like that again.</v>

1076
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:53.220
I mean that's pretty reptilian cold blooded behavior.

1077
01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.920
<v 3>Yeah.
And are like,
what's the fucking bartender?</v>

1078
01:03:56.990 --> 01:04:00.740
Daylight and like keep it on the fucking low man.
Like what?
Yeah,
he's an asshole.

1079
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:02.960
Hey Go Mitzi.

1080
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.830
<v 0>And you know,
and you know he saw the wedding rings.</v>

1081
01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:11.000
<v 3>Like he cannot be cool.
Like he just had to be like a guy.
Wow.</v>

1082
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:12.800
So what is he asking?
What do I do?

1083
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.840
<v 0>Yeah,
cause she's not sleeping in the thing.</v>

1084
01:04:15.841 --> 01:04:20.010
And he said the only solution is divorced or I forgive her sleeping in the thing

1085
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:23.720
in the bedroom when she's sleeping.
Yeah.
No,

1086
01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:26.820
he hasn't talked to her in a week other than dealing with shit that they have to

1087
01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:27.421
talk about what?

1088
01:04:27.421 --> 01:04:30.450
Just the kids because he's not ready to and he's saying that the,

1089
01:04:30.451 --> 01:04:32.610
either they get fucking divorced or he forgives her,

1090
01:04:32.611 --> 01:04:35.220
but he hasn't told them he was friends and family because he's so embarrassed.

1091
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.110
<v 3>I I understand that.
Yeah.
I mean</v>

1092
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:44.830
you made this whole life.
Were there,
you have kids with her.
I don't know.

1093
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:49.570
Is that really a deal breaker?
That's the thing though.

1094
01:04:49.571 --> 01:04:53.710
Is she still like messing around?
That's the thing.
The trust is broken.

1095
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:58.180
So how do you repair the trust couple's therapy?
Yeah,

1096
01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:01.660
that's the only way.
I mean is she interested in like,
may she,

1097
01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:05.770
was she apologizing profusely?
Was she like,
I'm so ashamed.

1098
01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:09.970
Like I should never have done it.
It was wrong.
You know,

1099
01:05:09.971 --> 01:05:12.520
I love you so much.
Like I love our family.
Like,

1100
01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:15.670
I'll do anything to like make this better.
Cause that's,

1101
01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:19.780
that's a hell of a thing to,
to do the night before your marriage.

1102
01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:24.580
You're getting married in the bed that you then fuck your husband and you

1103
01:05:24.581 --> 01:05:28.480
believe that she's never done it again.
I don't know.
I don't,

1104
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:33.250
I believe it cause I feel like women can do that.
Like do that.

1105
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.730
Do you see what I'm saying?
How good they are at being pieces of shit.

1106
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:41.260
They all cover each other.
I think that women can do that.
Guys can't do that.

1107
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:46.300
But we can do that.
Yeah.
All right.
Get Out.
You're kicking me out.

1108
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.690
I'm kicking you out.
I'm not saying that guys can't do that,
but yeah,

1109
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:53.080
I feel like she's capable of light.
Why would you say that women can do that?

1110
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:57.220
Because I'm talking about women.
So why,
why wouldn't you say that?
Well I feel it.

1111
01:05:57.221 --> 01:06:01.180
Some people can do that cause I don't have to use your language to get like my

1112
01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:04.990
point across.
But you just sorta,
they made just about women though.
I just,

1113
01:06:04.991 --> 01:06:07.450
interesting.
I'm cross examining you right now.
It's kind of fun,

1114
01:06:07.451 --> 01:06:10.540
but you try to worm your way out of this bullshit trying to warm their way.

1115
01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.800
I have anything wriggle.
Yeah,
keep drinking your fucking drink there.

1116
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.640
So my roommate's sister was in town this weekend while he was out of town.

1117
01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:22.450
She was going to the bars,
uh,
with some,
uh,

1118
01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:25.810
France and crashing on a brother's bed and the place.

1119
01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:27.520
She invited me out with her and I said,
sure.

1120
01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:30.820
I figured she make a heck of a wing man and I could hit it off with one of her

1121
01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:33.040
friends.
Unfortunately that wasn't what happened.
Anyways,

1122
01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:35.740
we came back to my apartment where she was going to stay in her brother's bed

1123
01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:39.910
for,
I knew it.
One thing led to another and I was banging her life for her.

1124
01:06:39.911 --> 01:06:43.450
Nailed what I was under.
The clothes fly off and she bends over.

1125
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.420
It started with some making out and she was the one who said,

1126
01:06:46.421 --> 01:06:51.421
let's go to your bed before you start thinking this is going to turn into the

1127
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:55.990
wrong side of a me too story.
Hilarious.
That even puts that in there.

1128
01:06:55.991 --> 01:07:00.460
I that sounded all cash tag me too.
All right.

1129
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:04.420
In the morning we both regretted it and she said it would probably be best not

1130
01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:07.210
to tell my roommate and her brother about the incident.
Unfortunately,

1131
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:12.450
she was able to leave and go back to her place five hours away.

1132
01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:17.230
Well,
I have to see the guy every single day.
Oh,
okay.

1133
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.320
I also did it with no condom,
like a drunken idiot,

1134
01:07:20.321 --> 01:07:24.460
so I've been freaking out about STDs and pregnancy even though I'm 99% sure I

1135
01:07:24.461 --> 01:07:28.960
didn't finish and made her get plan B the next night.

1136
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:32.500
I'm pretty sure.
Excellent.
Careful.
He's probably an accountant major.

1137
01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.600
I'm pretty sure she'll never tell him,
but I'm kind of a pussy and feel like I,

1138
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.430
I'll be plagued with guilt every time I hang out with the guy.
What should I do?

1139
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:46.150
I'm sort of panicking and have a weight on my chest for the last week.

1140
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:50.230
Should I suck it up and go to the grave with this?
I told a guy,

1141
01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:51.460
a couple of friends about this,

1142
01:07:51.461 --> 01:07:54.970
to get it up by conscious and now I'm afraid one of them might let it slow.
Dude,

1143
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:58.630
you don't do that.
Let it slip one of these nights while we're all out drinking,

1144
01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:03.310
should I get ahead of the story and just tell him and suffer the consequences?

1145
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:08.470
Or maybe I should stop being con and worry about people with actual problems.

1146
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.360
I Dunno.
Glad.
Uh,
you're okay.
Well,
I,
I would say this,

1147
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:15.650
I would say this,
um,

1148
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:22.180
you're like that guy that commits a fucking crime with somebody else and then

1149
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:24.680
you're the guy they have to whack because you're going to flip.

1150
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:28.970
And what you basically did was you flipped on yourself and you ratted yourself

1151
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:32.600
out to two other fucking people.
All right.
So,

1152
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.830
um,
in the swirl of trash,
that's now going to happen,

1153
01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:41.810
I bet for upwards of 10 years or maybe never.
Um,

1154
01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:45.650
if you do something like that and you both agree to keep your fucking mouth
shut,

1155
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:49.580
that's what she should have done because this isn't just about you.

1156
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:54.400
It's also about his relationship with his sister.
All right.

1157
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.690
So I don't get both adults.
It was consensual.
You didn't want it to happen.

1158
01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:03.530
It happened then you both said that was a fucking mistake.
Nobody's married here.

1159
01:09:03.531 --> 01:09:07.040
There's no kid involved.
I wouldn't have said Shit.
Yeah,

1160
01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:11.750
I think he should just keep a trap shut and just move on with your life.
Yeah.

1161
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.730
And you also have to go kill your two friends.

1162
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.830
You never watched those JFK conspiracies.
Um,

1163
01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:24.470
you tell the other two guys cause he just felt so guilty about it and yes,

1164
01:09:24.471 --> 01:09:28.940
the telltale heart,
it's up.
This is ball bag dick throbbing underneath.

1165
01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.190
It's really not.
It's not that big of a deal.
Yeah.

1166
01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:36.950
And she did turn out to be pregnant and kept it.
Yes,

1167
01:09:36.951 --> 01:09:38.480
of course you'd have to come clean,

1168
01:09:38.481 --> 01:09:43.160
but you're even say go through with an abortion without,
he doesn't need to know.

1169
01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.400
No,
I wasn't going to say that.
What are you talking about?
As you said,

1170
01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:49.250
if she got pregnant,
she got pregnant and decided to keep it.

1171
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:52.310
Then you say something but she,
she got pregnant and didn't want to keep it.

1172
01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:56.330
You don't say shit.
You know what I'm saying?
But she took the plan B.

1173
01:09:56.331 --> 01:10:00.140
So it's just like,
it's fine.
This feels like a fast times at Ridgemont high.

1174
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.760
I'm just picturing judge Reinhold at big blue car.
I know,

1175
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:06.560
but she didn't get an abortion and she took a plan B.
So it's,
it's,
it's fine sir.

1176
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:11.060
Do you sell stereos?
Um,
that's for old people would get that joke.

1177
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:12.530
She banged that goes,
sold the stairs.

1178
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.670
She's got to be some baddies bay tonight.

1179
01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.990
Really creepy song choice.
Um,

1180
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:27.890
only bangs are right on that fucking bench.
Yeah.

1181
01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.150
She's such a cutie pie that when she was that age,
Jennifer,
Jason Leigh,

1182
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.280
I liked that movie.
Ageism too.
She's not a cutie pie now.

1183
01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.730
Now she's a beautiful woman.

1184
01:10:37.731 --> 01:10:41.830
Now that she was a cutie pie when she was a younger mm hmm.

1185
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.960
When we return,
there's nothing there for you to dig out this.
And I think,

1186
01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.990
well that's,
well that's the age we live in.
If there is nothing your,

1187
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.820
if there's something there or there's nothing there,

1188
01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.110
you're still going to be punished.
Oh,
you look extra pretty today.

1189
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.800
What'd you do?
Since I left,
I dunno.

1190
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.990
You fucking a guy at a bowling alley.
Yup.
Yup.
I ain't going to be like,

1191
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:07.460
I ain't doing,
Mitzi
is going to be my code name.
Now,

1192
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.430
if I do step out on you,
I'm going by Mitzi.

1193
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:14.383
You know what?

1194
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.510
<v 0>I'm so old.
That guy be doing me a favor.
Oh,</v>

1195
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:23.190
Phoebe doesn't happen in a Mandy Moore Claremont top.
I'm too old.

1196
01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.710
You're just as much of a stallion.

1197
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:36.150
The truth hurts.
The truth hurts.
I tell you,
I'd rather take a nap at this point.

1198
01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:40.230
No,
you would not.
I would know you.
You'd rather take a nap then bang me.

1199
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.480
Oh No.
We got to see how that works.
Everybody.

1200
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:50.760
That's exactly how it's done.
It's son of a man.
All right.
That's it.

1201
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:53.800
That's the best lesson I could have taught anybody.
All right.

1202
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:56.820
Have a great fucking week.
Your consult.
Talk to you on Thursday.
