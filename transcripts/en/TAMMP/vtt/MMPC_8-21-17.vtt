00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:09.980

00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:10.300

Jesus,</v>

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.650
I've got a cough drop in my mouth.
I got a halls mental lip.
This,

7
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:23.020
you're not going to want to listen to this are you?
You know what?

8
00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:26.860
I don't have time to start it over again.
I just don't.
You know,

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.850
one of the weirdest things ever is when you have to go on a microphone and you

10
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:33.100
got to fucking halls and your God damn mouth in what?

11
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.150
Like how do you make it go by faster?
Am I supposed to just spit it out?

12
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:41.560
Is that what you want from me?
All right,
I will.
I don't know where to go here.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.290
You just kind of have to hang on a second.
Just hang on.
Hang on.
Hang Up.

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.620
Fuck on this fucking thing out.

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.550
<v 0>Bombs that make noise.
It's still a podcast.
It's still a podcast.</v>

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.200
As long as I make noise.
All right,
I'm back.
I'm back and I got the energy.

18
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:03.441
All right.

19
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:08.441
This is the Monday morning podcast for it's for fucking August 21st,

20
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.360
2017.
You know,
they ain't got no August over there in the Middle East.

21
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.260
You know why they don't believe in Christ.
Do you know,

22
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.210
believe in crash?
God's like,
well,
you know what?
And guess what?

23
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:26.050
You ain't got no more August.
Right?
That's why I was so mad all the time.

24
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:30.830
Or summers goes by some fucking fast.
That's true,
man.
You can look it up.

25
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.590
Go look it up on the poo to her over there.
Shit.
Um,

26
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.270
I'm in a great fucking mood.
I got a bunch of shit to do.
As always,

27
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.830
as always.
I'm recording this quarter,
five California time,

28
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.710
um,
on Sunday.
You know,
and I put all this money down on the Red Sox,
right?

29
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.480
You know,
I've been betting the red sox gambling.
Okay.

30
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:00.710
I'm betting on the red sox.
Two of my friends a Yankee fence,

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.050
right?
It's on the edge.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yap.

32
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.880
Get yet yet Paul is fucking shit.
All rise.

33
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.420
Court's in session.
Can we hear from the bailiff weekend?

34
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.620
His last name is judge Jesus fucking Christ.

35
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.670
How did,

36
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.480
how do people in sports get away with the fucking punch or just basically the

37
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:24.230
newspaper industry in general?
My God.

38
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.700
<v 1>Have you reached a verdict?
Yes,
we have.
Your honor.</v>

39
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.350
That was a home run.
You get it.

40
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.380
<v 0>There is so bad.</v>

41
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.480
<v 0>This sofa,
I wish,</v>

43
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.570
I just wish sweet Caroline was his funny bad is all those Aaron judge punts.

44
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.880
If they could just make it that fun as opposed to just watching a bunch of

45
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.890
people who you know on fucking black Friday,

46
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:57.140
you have their face pressed up against the wall mart window.
Go ahead.

47
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.623
<v 1>Right.</v>

48
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.720
<v 0>How'd that song became part of the tradition?</v>

49
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.830
When the fuck did that happen?
When did it happen?

50
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.800
When will it go away?
You know,
it's bad enough.

51
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:16.410
They sing,
take me out to the ballgame and never used to do that.

52
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:17.041
In the seventh thing,

53
00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:21.000
he just stood up and stretched and then Harry Carey did it and it was great.

54
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.863
You know why?

55
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.710
Because he believed it and he was shit faced and he was hanging out the fucking

56
00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:29.300
window and you're like,
is that guy going to fall?
You know,

57
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.560
you know those guys who to boos their whole life,

58
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.160
they get this big round belly and then they got those little pretzel rod sticks.

59
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:38.520
So when he started getting a lot of that fucking keg out the window,

60
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.270
you know,
that's why they have that net above home plate.
You know what I mean?

61
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:46.620
Over the fans.
It's,
you know,

62
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.370
that goes back to it has nothing to do with foul balls.
It has to go to,

63
00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:54.330
back in the day there was so many fat alcoholic sticking their head out,

64
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.860
you know,
doing God knows what back then,

65
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.200
you know,
I imagine initially,
yeah,

66
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.650
they were just amazed that they weren't on the second floor of a structure

67
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.900
sticking their head out.
Like,
you know,
gee willikers how the hell is this thing?

68
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.570
Okay.
It was probably people underneath me that I can't say right.

69
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.310
Then that gradually morphed into,
Holy Shit,
look how far,
you know,

70
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:21.660
loud Racor July labral hair right.
Far Right.

71
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:25.200
If I can fire that morphed into that.
Okay.

72
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.850
And then somewhere in there it was like,
oh my God,

73
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.500
is that a black guy on the field?
You know,
they,

74
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.860
they've always been hanging out the window for years and years and years.

75
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.510
And that's why that net was there.
Everybody thinks it's a protective fence.

76
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.390
It's not to protect the fans.
Back in the day,
everybody wore a hat.

77
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.370
They will fine.
Okay.
The ball wasn't juiced up.

78
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:48.430
It was the dead ball era.
It go up in the air or you know,

79
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.360
those people were tough back then.
They built railroads with their fucking hands,

80
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.480
you know,
and that's just the Chinese.
Okay,

81
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:58.870
forget about the people dead fucking built the A,

82
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:03.730
I dunno what the cotton gin.
All right,
I'm off the fucking rails here.

83
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.890
I don't know what I'm talking about.
All I know is that I'm like,
all right,

84
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.080
I got to get back into baseball.
You know what I mean?
I'm an old man.

85
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.560
It's a slow game and then all of a sudden it gets exciting and then it slows

86
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.750
down again.
Right.
Just like that thing.
As you get older,

87
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:18.580
every once in a while your heart does something and you're like,

88
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:22.780
am I going to fucking die here?
Okay,
no,
I'm good.
Right.
That's what baseball is.

89
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.450
And the rest of the time it's just fucking sitting there,
you know,

90
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.740
like waiting for a cough drop to dissolve so you can start your fucking podcast.

91
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.070
That's type of shit.
So anyways,
um,

92
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.170
I decided out of the fucking blue to

93
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.030
Tibet with two of my friends,
both Yankee fence,
right?

94
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.500
Once a gang and giant fan.
The as a Yankee and a Patriot fan figure that one up.

95
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.480
It's one of those Connecticut stories,
right?
You heard of a Bronx tale.

96
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:56.110
This is the sequel called Connecticut Story and this guy's a Yankee and a

97
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:59.030
patriots fan.
The most bizarre,

98
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.350
one of the more bizarre combinations of fans I've ever,
I've ever seen.

99
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.850
Um,
so I bet at ball,
you know,
50 bucks each a game.

100
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.200
So they stand to lose 50 again 50 I'm dropping a scene out of picking it up on

101
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.620
the last two series.
So we want two out of three on both of them.

102
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.720
So freckles here is up a hundred bucks,
right?
Is that right?
Let's see.

103
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:25.070
I was down a hundred then I was even then I was up 100 then it was up 200 then I

104
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.590
was up a hundred now I'm up 200 bucks.
Ooh,

105
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.990
right.
I loved it.
I almost made an extra 50 cause the guy's got,
don't,

106
00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:36.620
I'm telling you right now to fucking Aaron judge,

107
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.490
you know everybody's going to rise and coach going to be in session and they're

108
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:43.430
going to reach a verdict and now he's going to end up,
I get it.
I get it.

109
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.680
He's going to hit a home run and I was like,

110
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:52.681
you fucking cock sucker that guys like all for 50 with guys on base against the

111
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.960
Red Sox to the last couple of weekends.
It course the guys do.

112
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.620
It's Goddamn Paul Bunyan going up there swinging the bat.

113
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.980
And then I thought about,
I was like,
all right,
fuck it.
I'll bet you.
Um,

114
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.070
but I was voice texting and I said,
I'll bet you 50 bucks he doesn't,

115
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.360
but it wrote,
I bet your fixed 50 bucks.
He does it.

116
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.840
And then I didn't hear back from him and I was like,
all right,

117
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:20.000
you got until midnight tonight to get your bed in or at the,

118
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:21.760
the offers off the table.
And I,

119
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:25.000
you said he fell asleep but he was probably sitting on like,
well dude,

120
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:29.800
I said he was gonna do it.
Why would you?
I said he'd do it for 20 bucks.

121
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.700
Then you said you also think he's going to do it for 50.

122
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.220
I think I weirded him out.
He hasn't called me all day.

123
00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:39.640
So that might be the end of that friendship.
It's funny how that happens,
right?

124
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.710
15 year friendship can end on a voice text that somebody doesn't understand.

125
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.500
Um,
so anyways,

126
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:50.890
so red sox took the fucking series and you know why they took the series?

127
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.910
Because we spent 200 million fucking dollars and God damn it.
You know,

128
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:57.820
we better be the fucking Yankees if we're going to spend that kind of money.

129
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.130
I don't know what the,
yeah,
I didn't know what the Yankee spent this year.

130
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.250
I just don't think that most of their own draft picks,
it really doesn't matter.

131
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.570
Right.
Or does it?
I have no idea.

132
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.130
Do you guys see in Spain they set up 800 checkpoints to catch that fucking cunt?

133
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.503
<v 3>MMM.</v>

134
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.020
<v 0>Did they catch the guy?
I Dunno.</v>

135
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:18.420
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

136
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.720
<v 0>Desperate to ease public fears of neutralize a terrorist cell responsible for</v>

137
00:08:21.721 --> 00:08:25.140
the deadliest attack in Spain.
Are they gonna neutralize the,
uh,

138
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.190
the terrorist cell?
It was actually going to,
I guess going to be way more deadly,

139
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.130
but the fucking dopes accidentally blew themselves up.

140
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.210
I'm trying to make a bomb.
That's the greatest thing that can happen.

141
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.600
That's my favorite terrorist story when they were building it and then it

142
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:42.810
fucking blows up.
It's such a fucked up world,
man.

143
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.580
There's just people on both sides that are just out of their fucking minds.

144
00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:49.380
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.

145
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:51.450
Why can't you just fucking be like me and you know,

146
00:08:51.451 --> 00:08:56.040
battle booze and watch sports and get excited.
Things that don't matter.

147
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.210
Why do you have to have a fucking cause and get all into some invisible fucking

148
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.290
guy that you never fucking met and then everybody around you has to die if they

149
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.580
don't think the way you think.

150
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:07.603
<v 4>Okay,</v>

151
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.610
<v 0>what is it?</v>

152
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.610
There's a tipping point in religion and it's a combination of like,

153
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:16.710
<v 3>okay,</v>

154
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.430
<v 0>you believe too much and you got too much fucking,
I don't know what</v>

155
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.180
<v 4>you know.
I used to a bit about that.</v>

156
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.130
<v 0>Do you have like too much power and you get too much into fucking religion?</v>

157
00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:31.360
Like it always goes bad.
You started pressing other fucking people.
You know,

158
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.310
like when my people really get into Jesus white people,
it gets fucking scary.

159
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.830
<v 4>You know?
Black people get really into Jesus.
Yeah.</v>

160
00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:45.720
Now it's a fucking great service killer band.
That's it.

161
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.280
They're confined white people.
It's an open fucking field.

162
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:52.680
Whatever the fuck they think they did,
they did.
They just,
they run with it.

163
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.100
No checks and balances.
That's the problem.

164
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.000
<v 0>So I don't know what goes on with these foreign,</v>

165
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.090
I didn't know what the fuck I'm talking about,

166
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:01.470
but I don't know what goes on with these people.

167
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.190
What the fuck you can fence somebody that they are less fucking move on the

168
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:06.940
planet is you're going to walk into a,

169
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.500
to a group of people sitting there watching a show or eating a fucking slice of

170
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:14.910
pizza and you're going to kill all of them.
And uh,
then God's going to be like,

171
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:18.840
Hey,
nice going.
Whoo.
Hey Buddy,

172
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.400
I want to talk to you.
You know what?
I would've done that,
but I could dig it.

173
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:27.270
Thank God you thought to do that.
I Dunno.
So anyways,

174
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.980
so good luck to Spain.

175
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.550
IOP will rattle Kate those clients right out of your fucking beautiful country.

176
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.703
<v 4>MMM.</v>

177
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.310
<v 0>Anyways,
I know.
Why do I talk world politics?
Why know why?</v>

178
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:43.370
Cause it makes you guys feel smarter.
Right?
Hey bill,

179
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:47.090
maybe next time you bring up Spain,
maybe you could fuck ag.
Go Fuck Yourself.

180
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.860
I'll do what I want.
Oh,
by the way,
I got some,
uh,
I got some,

181
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.040
I got a giveaway this week for the first thousand people.
All right.
No,

182
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.430
wait a second before you take out you fucking first.

183
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:05.110
The first thousand people that text a particular phrase to a particular number.

184
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.220
Well,
when some all things,
comedy merchandise.
So they basically stickers.

185
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.463
All right.

186
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

187
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.560
<v 0>Texted,
is that what it is yet?
And I'm just letting you know that,</v>

188
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.540
that this is so they can build,

189
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:22.541
build up their email fucking database and let you guys know what's going on with

190
00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.250
this site.
Okay.
So it's fucking transparent.

191
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.770
What we're trying to do here for the price of a sticker.

192
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.680
That's what we're trying to do.
You know,

193
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:34.500
we're trying to get more social media and all that type of shit because I'm,

194
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.720
we got big shit coming up on all things.
Comedy relaunched the website.

195
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.123
Um,

196
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.050
next month Bert Kreischer has a cooking show on there called something's
burning.

197
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.100
Uh,
I'm going to be doing those road rage fucking videos,

198
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:51.620
whether you got the fucking camera on me and all of that shit.

199
00:11:51.621 --> 00:11:53.350
And then the person that did whatever they did,

200
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.720
Philippe is spars is going to be doing a home improvement show.

201
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.070
Basically your favorite comics doing the shit that they liked to do,
being funny.

202
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.210
Um,
we got our first stand up special release with Paul Versey.

203
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:12.070
We've got a bunch of stuff going on and talks of yes,
all kinds of other things,

204
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:14.860
sports shows and all this type of stuff.
So,
uh,
we're trying to,

205
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.440
got to let you guys know what's going on.
So here's what you do.

206
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:19.840
If you want a sticker,
if you don't want to do it,
don't fucking do it.

207
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.200
But if you want to do it,
all you need to do is text all capitals,

208
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.750
no space bill burr,
B I l L,

209
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:30.700
B u r r two four four two two two.

210
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.710
Reggie Jackson,
Doug Flutie,
Derek fucking jar.

211
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:39.170
Fuck that.
Jerry Remy,
the rem dark.
It was his day today.

212
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.180
I would've said Derek Cheetah,
uh,
44,

213
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.990
22 to two fours,
three twos.

214
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.410
You got it for a sticker and then we'll be bugging you.

215
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:53.260
Let you know what's going on with all these great shows we have coming up.

216
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.140
You know,
we got Bobby Lee,
we got our Madrigal,

217
00:12:56.141 --> 00:13:00.900
we've got all these fucking people.
All right,
we have our re shift fear.

218
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.320
Um,
all right.
So anyways,
and I gotta be honest with you,
uh,

219
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.720
after these last six games,
red sox,
Yankees,

220
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.020
and having money on the game,
I gotta be honest with you,

221
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.180
after all these years,

222
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:20.980
seeing Pete rose shouldn't be in the hall of fame that the man was right betting

223
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:22.780
on baseball.
It makes it better.

224
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.650
It does makes it fuck it makes you care.
You know,

225
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.620
you think October,
baseball is exciting.

226
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:33.250
Puts your paycheck on a fucking game in August.
All right?

227
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.840
You don't need Joe Buck and all those extra fucking microphones to make that

228
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:38.674
exciting.

229
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.360
Dude,
am I getting a Camaro with tee tops?
Am I going to be homeless?
You know,

230
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.680
that's the type that's,

231
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.780
that's the type of stakes that you want to raise a,
I'm calling it right now.

232
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.100
Patriots,
giants,
the rubber game this year.

233
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.020
Super Bowl patriots.
Finally fucking win,
right?

234
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.400
No helmet.
Catch no fucking owl Brady to Welker fucking two foot pass.

235
00:14:07.401 --> 00:14:11.050
It goes in complete Noah's Dante,
Samuel drop in the fucking ball.

236
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.490
None of that shit.
We're finally going to beat those concen you know,
Hawaii,

237
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.970
Tom Kaufland.
No.
Tom Conference going to be the difference.

238
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.840
I love what the giants are doing,
I think,
I think they're going to,
you know,

239
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:27.600
and they got fucking Eli.
He's got ice fucking water in his vates.

240
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.810
All right.
Dead team is looking good.

241
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.741
All right.

242
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:35.470
And I'm telling you that team's looking good cause I've paid attention for about

243
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:38.650
eight minutes during this preseason and uh,
I've,

244
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:42.160
I've just been hearing a lot of chatter about weapons being added and in field

245
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:46.330
goal kickers and all of this type of shit.
And people question in Ely,

246
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.430
right as he sits there and he's dockers and his fucking,
uh,
you know,

247
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.630
I don't know what he's,
you know,
he,
oh,

248
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.590
he always looks like he just did the right thing the way he dresses,
right?
Yeah.

249
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.880
The loafers,
the fucking pants,
the sweater,
you know,

250
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.880
just like he dresses the way I should be dressing in my age and he's like

251
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:08.930
fucking 12 years younger than me and the man gets the fucking job done.

252
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:13.920
The later this season is,
and forget about in January,
the man is lights out.
Okay.

253
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:20.730
Telling you,
telling you it's going to be a rematch and we're going to win.

254
00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:23.220
And I that that's the fucking team I want to play.

255
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.490
That is the fucking team I want to play because we got nothing to lose.

256
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.490
They got everything to lose because if they're two window,

257
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.860
they can talk shit for the rest of the fucking time.
I want another shot,

258
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.210
right the fuck to an three.
You know,
I don't give a fuck.

259
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.340
That doesn't make any difference.
But if we get that last one,

260
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.430
but the guy they're moving,
then we can give him shit.
I,
you know what the fuck,

261
00:15:44.431 --> 00:15:47.030
you know it's not,
they,
Sandra dropped the fucking ball and it was a spring,

262
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.910
you know,
whatever.
Whatever we got ya.
Then it's,
then it's over.

263
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.020
Then we got that thing we could say back.
That's what I'm saying.
You know,

264
00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.150
cause I've ran through a couple of giants fair.
They're like,
oh they a dog.

265
00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.930
You don't fuck away.
Well why don't we want it that just logos at this point,

266
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:06.410
Eli's probably the only guy left from that 2017 and I bet at least,

267
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.240
I don't know,
three quarters of that.
Both teams are gone since the last one.

268
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.660
That's why I never get into those types of stats.

269
00:16:13.661 --> 00:16:17.100
Go and let these guys will stored glial.
But the,
we'll get blue,
blue,

270
00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:18.550
you'd say it's all different people.

271
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.480
It's all different people wearing the same clothes with better drugs,

272
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.080
better trucks,
better drugs in their system.
Okay.

273
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.780
Just like the drugs that was sent to a particular quarterbacks wife.
Okay.

274
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.410
Cause she hurt her arm taking cookies out of the oven.
Okay.

275
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.110
It was a complete non story.
However,

276
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.010
had that guy taking a queef worth of air out of a ball,

277
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.330
all of his ranks would have been questioned.
That's how it works.
Okay.

278
00:16:46.331 --> 00:16:51.290
We're taking callers.
Um,
you know what I did today?
I,

279
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.240
I,
you know,
it was funny,
I did so much,
so many fucking positive things today.

280
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.900
So many.
This,
this podcast is not one of them,

281
00:16:58.901 --> 00:17:02.680
but I did so many fucking positive things today.
You know,

282
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.740
and then my wife laugh.

283
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.340
She still had the nerve to be moody

284
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.440
and I don't know about you guys,
but oh,
what the fuck goes on.

285
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.100
I don't know about you.
I don't want to put up with that.

286
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.720
I don't put up with the moodiness.
Okay,
come on.
What do I gotta do here?

287
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.810
What happened?
Fucking thing just died on me here.

288
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:30.220
Here we go.
Um,
I don't put up with that Moody Shit.
If I did something,

289
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.640
you got me.
I'm sorry.
All right.
I said I'm sorry.
No,

290
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.380
that Moody Shit.
If I do fucking nine things right,

291
00:17:38.381 --> 00:17:41.150
and then the 10 things wrong and then you're going to get all moody with me,

292
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.980
I swear to God.
I swear.
I just,

293
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.250
that's it.
You know what I do?
I go,
hey,
hey,
what's going on?

294
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.510
And if she doesn't fucking snap out of it,
then,
then it that I just shut down.

295
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.060
You know?
And then you don't,
you know,
I'm fucking German,
Irish.

296
00:17:58.061 --> 00:18:01.140
She want to play the silence game.
I can do this all fucking do this forever.

297
00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.710
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

298
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.410
<v 0>All right.
You think there's a lot of silence in master of none.</v>

299
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.170
Let me tell you something right now.
I can do fucking silence.

300
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.670
I don't know why I'm making this motion with my hand.
I grew up with that shit.

301
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.900
Rage,
silence.
You know,

302
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.850
days going by how you dumped console.
Going to stare at the sun tomorrow.

303
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.810
Do yourself a favor.
Just wait for the pictures.
You know what I mean?

304
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.440
Looking at a fucking lunar eclipse.
The solar eclipse,

305
00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:33.220
whatever the fuck's going on here.
It's a lunar eclipse,
right?

306
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.080
Is it the lunar eclipse?

307
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.970
This is the one I learned that when the earth is between the sun and the moon,

308
00:18:40.971 --> 00:18:44.850
the moon turns red
cause it,

309
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:46.940
it deflects the fucking light or something.

310
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.950
The only reason why I know this is consist,

311
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:52.330
Shit's happening on Monday and one of the writers in the writer's room knew this

312
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.110
shit.
And then there's the other one with the moon passes in front of this sign.

313
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.960
All my God,
this haven't happened for 37,
38 fucking years.

314
00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:02.893
<v 3>MMM.</v>

315
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.200
<v 0>Did you see that little,
not Amin.</v>

316
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.580
Was it a jiff that thing going around about that newscaster that actually really

317
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.590
used to like,
he used to watch him when I was a kid and he said that little,

318
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.080
uh,
that the clubs that I was a little bit with the blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

319
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.640
and there's not going to be another one in 38 years and let's hope that when it

320
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.990
did fucking happens on a world that knows nothing but peace,

321
00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.170
you know?
And everybody's like,
wow,

322
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.110
<v 2>okay,</v>

323
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.800
<v 0>wow,
wow.
He said that and then wow.
It's just like,
what do you,</v>

324
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.840
we've never been at peace ever,
ever.

325
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.230
Never will be.
They'll never be world peace than ever.
We were up at the,

326
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.220
the level of,
of violence that would have to occur for there to be peace.

327
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.140
You'd have to be the last person on earth because if there's another person,

328
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.280
there was just two people.

329
00:19:55.281 --> 00:19:59.510
At some point the other person is going to annoy you and then there goes the

330
00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:00.344
peace.

331
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.533
<v 3>Right.</v>

332
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.030
<v 0>That's what happened with Adam and eve.
All right.</v>

333
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.340
To tell you what all you people out there that believe we came from fucking the

334
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:14.110
ocean.
I actually believe in,
in,
in creationism,

335
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.070
whatever the fuck they call it.
All right.

336
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:23.830
There was two white people that started all of this in.
Somehow we had,

337
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.020
<v 2>okay.</v>

338
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.560
<v 0>All the other races out of them.</v>

339
00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.323
<v 3>MMM.</v>

340
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.820
<v 0>He's two white people,
right.
Adam and eve and they got annoyed with each other,</v>

341
00:20:34.821 --> 00:20:39.520
so she goes for a walk.
Right.
The snake gets in a rare next thing,
you know?
Right.

342
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.523
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

343
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.570
<v 0>She goes over and she bites an apple,
which for whatever reason is,
is healthy.</v>

344
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:48.520
It's a good thing.
It's got fiber in it,

345
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.383
<v 3>you know?</v>

346
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.790
<v 0>I don't understand why the man,</v>

347
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:56.750
the visible guy was upset by that because you know what?

348
00:20:56.751 --> 00:20:58.610
It was an apple with the sugar in it,

349
00:20:58.611 --> 00:21:03.200
like because there was no weed or coke or meth or anything like that,

350
00:21:03.201 --> 00:21:08.000
like apples where I guess the heroin it back then and he said,

351
00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.250
let me tell you two little shit.
Something.
All right,

352
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.690
you want to live in this fucking garden of Eden in?
Well,

353
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.640
stay away from the fucking apple tree.

354
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.163
<v 3>That's it.</v>

355
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.160
<v 0>She went down and she's probably going to,
hey,
you know,</v>

356
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.440
I'm going to go down and eat one of those fucking apples and and fucking what's

357
00:21:27.441 --> 00:21:29.030
his face?
Whatever it was.
It a brother.

358
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.090
I don't know what went and the none of that fucking,
he's anybody religious.

359
00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:35.210
Listen to this shit.
How the fuck the two white people,
okay,

360
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.190
fuck and create all different races of people.
Forget about that.

361
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:45.290
How have you just have to f two fucking people and then they bang and then what?

362
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.230
How do you keep it going?
They're kids have to fuck.

363
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.300
Exactly.
You had nothing,
didn't yet.

364
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.170
Their kids have to fuck.

365
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.740
And then their kids kids,
fuck.

366
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.750
Is that how we went from Adam and eve to fucking cavemen

367
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.410
meander talls and when those other fucking people with those slopey foreheads,

368
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.100
you know,
and that,
that fucking Frankenstein brow,
which I kind of have,
is that a,

369
00:22:21.101 --> 00:22:21.980
is that what happened?

370
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.720
Because Adam and eve banged and then their kids had to fair to sit down and say,

371
00:22:29.931 --> 00:22:30.860
children,

372
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.020
you have to fuck one another in order to keep this thing going.

373
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.943
<v 3>All right.</v>

374
00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.820
<v 0>None of it makes sense.</v>

375
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.540
None of those stories fucking makes sense anymore than the fat guy in the red

376
00:22:46.641 --> 00:22:50.030
fucking suit going down at goddamn chimney.
Okay?
First of all,

377
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.800
if it was fucking true,

378
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:56.660
all these new homes without fireplaces would not have a Christmas.

379
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.950
What are parents who live in houses without fireplaces?

380
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.010
Say you know up on the house,

381
00:23:04.011 --> 00:23:08.390
top reindeer paws out jumps,
good old Santa clause looking forward,
chimney,

382
00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:13.370
but there isn't one gets back in the say you have no fun.
Go Fuck Yourself,
right?

383
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.140
No guide him toys.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Go to child world.

384
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.490
All right then that's,
that's part of his contract.

385
00:23:22.491 --> 00:23:25.940
You leave cookies and there's a fucking chimney or that's it.
It's over.

386
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.450
That never he,
he has no interest in anybody who's not Christian.

387
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:41.250
He makes toys for everybody unless they are not Christian.

388
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.040
You know what it is?
It's just everyone.
When we were

389
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.510
<v 2>tribes and we had these,</v>

390
00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.980
we had travs and we just came up with these fucking stories and as it expanded

391
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:55.250
and everybody started fucking interact in all the holes in our shit,
you know,

392
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.640
when she got that global view,
they'd all fucked up.

393
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:01.010
All of a sudden the world wasn't flat,
you know,

394
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.520
depending on what basketball play you talked to,
it was route.

395
00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.920
He fobs sudden you did find out that it was fucking round.

396
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:09.530
These people aren't Indians.
They're not from the fuck.

397
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:13.960
And then add from India and from American Mac.
Right.

398
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.850
The greatest fuck,
oh by the way,
I forgot to say,
you know,
if you go to tech,

399
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.740
I just fucked up.
If you go to tex ethic,
we're not sending a sticker overseas.

400
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.020
By the way,
this is just for Americans only

401
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.880
by Americans.
I mean United States,
America,
maybe Canada,

402
00:24:28.881 --> 00:24:31.730
I know he can't do it cause it's a fucking sticker and then they've got to fill

403
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:36.080
out forms.
I should've said that earlier.
You know,

404
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:38.270
I should have done a lot of things in life,
but I got to tell you what,

405
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:39.540
not telling you guys that you know,

406
00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:44.541
if few texts that fucking number and it's in international and the stickers.com

407
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:46.790
and that's probably one of my biggest regrets.

408
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.880
Other than the fact the last time I didn't watch an eclipse,
you know,

409
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:55.790
there was a guy wishing for world peace.
The next time it came around.

410
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.590
<v 0>And now here we are 38 fucking years later,
38 years later.</v>

411
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.820
Are we any closer?

412
00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:08.693
<v 2>Okay.</v>

413
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.770
<v 0>I'm sure somebody said that in the 1940s,</v>

414
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.820
after fucking Hitler and Stalin and all that shit a,
you know,
there was a,
uh,

415
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.500
last night there was a typhoon.
I hope the next time there's a typhoon,

416
00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:23.580
it's a killing innocent people in a peaceful world.

417
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.710
It's never going to happen.
Well,
Jesus build now with that fucking attitude.

418
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.360
The children have to fuck when we return.

419
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.550
Part two of the Adam and Eve story,
the story no one wanted to show you.

420
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.480
Um,
all right.
So anyways,
I've been,
uh,

421
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:48.140
how many fucking minutes into this pile of Shit podcast and I do and my 25 or 26

422
00:25:48.631 --> 00:25:49.464
minutes people,

423
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.250
26 minutes of some of the most ignorant shit you're ever going to listen to yet

424
00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:58.250
you continue to listen,
you continue to listen.
Um,

425
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.170
all right.
You know what I did?
I,
so I did all this productive shit today and yes,

426
00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:06.270
my wife,
she started pulling the grumpy thing,
right?

427
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.890
Like I was going to wake up this morning of Bardot,

428
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.270
but they'll do it and I was going to go play drums.
All right?

429
00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:14.550
Which I'm still going to do,
but I'm gonna do it tonight.
Okay.

430
00:26:14.551 --> 00:26:17.370
But I could tell she was tired or whatever.
Okay.

431
00:26:17.371 --> 00:26:20.850
So the advantage [inaudible] that your lady,

432
00:26:20.851 --> 00:26:25.090
Hey Ula has,
is when the kids crying,

433
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.470
they always have the option of the boob.
Bam.

434
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.550
Instant shut it,
right?
Puts the kid to sleep.

435
00:26:32.551 --> 00:26:34.560
They feel comforted and all that type of stuff.

436
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:39.890
The only way that a man can compete in that arena is you have to either put the

437
00:26:40.771 --> 00:26:44.310
kid in the car and drive around block a few times,

438
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.900
<v 4>or what I think is better,</v>

439
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:48.510
you just put the kid in the stroller and you just walk around the block.

440
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.470
Now you're burning some of your dad bod calories.
You know,

441
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:54.960
your kid gets to look around and see a bunch of stuff.

442
00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.930
Fucking acid trip birds flying around,
jets,
cars,
trees,
right?

443
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:05.790
Everything's amazing to them.
And then eventually they fall asleep.
Um,

444
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.030
so anyways,
I could tell my wife,
my wife was a really sleepy,
so I said,
all right,

445
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:15.360
you know,
she goes to be really nice if you could just take it for a walk.

446
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.990
Because she was up at,
my wife wasn't,
and I was just like,
all right,

447
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:22.110
I was going to work out.
I'll go play drums.
You know what?
Fuck it,
I'll do it.

448
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.190
So I did,
went on a nice long walk,
did the whole thing.

449
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:27.180
We had a great time.

450
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.220
She finally fell asleep after like 20 minutes.

451
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.620
She finally falls asleep and then I walked around like extra,
you know,

452
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.750
take an extra long walk home and you know,

453
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.430
walking further past the house,
coming back up,
come back up.
You know,

454
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.390
my wife's still downstairs.
I can tell she's still sleeping.
We hung out.

455
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:51.030
We had breakfast together.
Right.

456
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.560
I watched a little of the Jerry Remy,
you know,

457
00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:58.650
Jerry Remy Day at Fenway Park.
Um,

458
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.310
just did all of that.
And then she didn't come upstairs to like fucking,
I dunno,

459
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.190
1130
11 o'clock or something,

460
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.630
something like that.
Since she goes,
all right,
let's go out today.
We said,

461
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:15.600
we going to go out.
And I'm like,
all right,
let's go out.
Let's go out.
So

462
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.500
she gets the kid ready and everything,
but the fucking shoes,

463
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:21.810
I tried to put the shoes,
I just can't do it.
I can't do it.

464
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.650
She tries to kick them off.
I start laughing and I can't get them on.

465
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.400
And I finally got one of 'em on and I realized they had it on the wrong foot.

466
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.540
And I was like,
fucking and undo the buckle.
And then I finally got it on right?

467
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.110
And she just kicked it off.
And I just laughed.
I said,
I can't do it.

468
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.400
I can't do it.
And I left.
She was like,
really?
And I said,
yeah.
I go,
look,

469
00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:44.100
there's somethings you're better at than I am.
You're just better at this,
right?

470
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:47.390
So I leave.
She goes,
where are you going?
I said,
I'm gonna go watch the red sox.

471
00:28:47.391 --> 00:28:49.560
She goes,
well,
come down here and watch it.
So I said,
okay.

472
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:54.561
So then he went upstairs and she told me how her tire pressure was down and uh,

473
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.560
I was trying to remember how to do that cause I knew I had the tire pressure

474
00:28:58.561 --> 00:28:59.460
fucking thing.
You know,

475
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.930
you stick the thing on there so you don't overinflate you don't under inflate,

476
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.900
I'm looking up that we've got a little water bubbler.
We're all out of water.

477
00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:08.760
It's a good opportunity to clean the fucking thing.

478
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:12.840
I'm looking at Shit like that when I'm up there.
So,
uh,

479
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.380
I didn't go back downstairs and she came upstairs fucking pissed at me because

480
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:22.920
she spent like whatever the next 15 minutes trying to get ready with my daughter

481
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:24.900
downstairs for Jane and stand,
there must be a pain in the ass,

482
00:29:24.901 --> 00:29:29.160
but I was up there fucking,
you know.
Yeah,
see,
yeah,

483
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:33.240
she gets in a mood now.
She's in a mood,
not yelling,

484
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.530
you know,
not flipping out just in a mood.

485
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.250
You know,
they know when they get in the fucking mood,

486
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.270
<v 0>they get this look on their face,</v>

487
00:29:43.271 --> 00:29:46.090
they stop looking at you and they'd make sure that they keep walking into the

488
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:48.210
room that you're in.
You know what?

489
00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:51.190
You talked to him and they barely say anything back.
So you do.
You know what?

490
00:29:51.191 --> 00:29:55.180
So you know what?
Come on guys.
Let's,
let's learn something here.

491
00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:56.540
<v 3>Okay?</v>

492
00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.550
<v 0>So you are aware that she's in a wad.</v>

493
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.700
Oh Jesus.
Somebody is in a mode.
I'm sorry.

494
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:11.900
Did I do 99 out of a hundred things?
Jesus fucking Christ.

495
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.730
So she's in a fucking mood.
Then I got to go out,
you know,

496
00:30:17.731 --> 00:30:20.550
cause I got my fucked up driveway.
I've got to get my car out of the way.

497
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.430
Bring her fucking car out because you've got to get the fucking air in the
tires.

498
00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.090
Oh,
when I'm out door,
you think I'm mother.
I put on a clinic of muttering,

499
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.810
we're going to kit up the Goddamn fucking,

500
00:30:30.811 --> 00:30:33.630
he'll come down and make a buck of his fucking blow up that deck and clean out

501
00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:36.150
the water bubble.
And I got to come home.

502
00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.180
Right Henry Hill.

503
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.153
<v 3>MMM.</v>

504
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.150
<v 0>So that's it.
And then I go on and be like,
all right,</v>

505
00:30:45.151 --> 00:30:49.680
I will match your mood with an even dumber mood.
So that's it.

506
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:52.440
So then she starts to,
since then,
I'm in a fucking mood now,

507
00:30:52.441 --> 00:30:54.270
was sure mood put me in a fucking mood.

508
00:30:54.271 --> 00:30:57.720
Now she's sensing that I'm in this fucking mood.
So now all of a sudden,

509
00:30:57.721 --> 00:31:01.050
what does she do?
She starts flipping it around being nice,

510
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.450
right?
And I'm just giving her fucking quick answers.

511
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.720
Like Jerry Lewis rest his soul passed away today,

512
00:31:10.721 --> 00:31:15.620
day Dick Gregory few days ago,
and now Jerry Lewis,
Jerry Lewis,

513
00:31:15.621 --> 00:31:19.220
arguably one of the funniest human beings that ever lived.

514
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:20.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

515
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:21.011
<v 0>Ever lived.</v>

516
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:25.900
He actually spoke at my college graduation and he was phenomenal.

517
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.700
He did the parent student breakfast.
And when he did that,

518
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:35.170
he was crazy.
Jerry.
And then when he spoke in my college,

519
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.560
he was,
uh,
coming down the aisle.
He was still crazy.
You know,

520
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.610
when they bring people in yet today that didn't,

521
00:31:41.611 --> 00:31:46.420
I'll fucking the fucking with the Dean and all those people come down with
their,

522
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.680
who we have a special colored tassels,
you know,
we're higher than you.
You know,

523
00:31:50.681 --> 00:31:54.820
they come down in their robes while he was coming down and he put his hands on

524
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:57.790
the shoulder of the person in front of him here when those dumb hats on to when

525
00:31:57.791 --> 00:31:59.860
he put his hands.
And when he walked down,
we just going,

526
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.850
[inaudible] came down and everyone was dying laughing.

527
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.260
But when he went to give the speech,
he was telethon.
Jerry,
it was great.

528
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.910
You got to see the full gamut of the guy.

529
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.533
<v 3>MMM,</v>

530
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.630
<v 0>absolutely love that guy.
That guy made me laugh like nobody's business.</v>

531
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:18.910
So very sad day and a Dick Gregory.

532
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.580
I learned about him obviously being a comedian long time ago.

533
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:24.670
Read that book Callus on my soul.
Um,

534
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.750
all those stories about him being one of the first black guys to ever work like

535
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:29.620
white rooms.

536
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:35.410
You know the playboy mansion in Chicago playing that because what's his face

537
00:32:35.411 --> 00:32:37.660
there?
Hugh Hefner was cool enough to let him play there.

538
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:42.560
So rest in peace to both of them.
Um,
so anyway,

539
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:46.190
so now it's all pales in comparison to those two comedy giants.
All right,

540
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:50.180
so I matched my wife's mood with my mood.
All right,

541
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.800
so now she's not done.
Okay,

542
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.480
now she's trying to be nice to get me out of my fucking mood.

543
00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.770
Cause then she realizes this is all silent by the way,
this is all body language.

544
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.940
All Kurt little answers,
one of these things.
Now she realizes that,
oh,

545
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:08.150
I took my mood too far.
I overly made my point,

546
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.260
which justified him now being in his fucking mood,
right?

547
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.660
So then at some point she finally just goes,
Hey,
I you just gonna to like,

548
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.470
she goes,
are you going to be in a bad mood for the rest of the day?
I'm like,

549
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.850
I'm not in a bad mood.
I'm in a great mood.
We have an awesome house.

550
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.880
I tell jokes for a living.
We're going to go get,
we're going to go out today.

551
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:34.010
I'm in a good mood.
I have the day off.
I am in a good mood.
You on the other hand,

552
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.260
I dunno if she goes,
I'm over it.
I'm over it.
I go fight.

553
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.220
<v 3>Okay.</v>

554
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.400
<v 0>It's not easy.
It's going to take that talk to me.
I said,
look,</v>

555
00:33:42.401 --> 00:33:46.000
we're going out shopping for kid's shoes.
The second I see kids shoes,

556
00:33:46.001 --> 00:33:48.550
it just puts me in a good mood.
They did.
If they fucking adorable,

557
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.340
those little Jordans,
the little shell toes,

558
00:33:51.341 --> 00:33:55.210
it's a kids' clothes are the cutest fucking things ever.

559
00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.530
They're not even for kids.
They're for adults.
See some little sport coat.

560
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.220
You're like,
no.
Yeah,
you can't help it.
So I told her,
I said,

561
00:34:05.221 --> 00:34:08.880
just let me get to the fucking kid sneakers and then that'll put me in a better

562
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.580
fucking mood.
Um,

563
00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.493
<v 3>okay.</v>

564
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.810
<v 0>Do you know what I saw today?
It's some fucking,
um,</v>

565
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.900
over on labrea they got this,
they got this store.

566
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:26.740
It's just all these crazy signs and all of this basically junk to shit from

567
00:34:27.771 --> 00:34:30.900
businesses that shut down or a remodeled.

568
00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:33.900
And this guy just has all these fucking sad,
sad.

569
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.620
So I'm walking up and they actually had the old school,

570
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:44.860
the little Mcdonald's arch with the Arrow that said drive through open 24 hours.

571
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:52.310
That's what put me in a good mood.
All the,
all the childhood memories.

572
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.670
We were a Mcdonald's family.
We were not a burger king family.

573
00:34:55.671 --> 00:35:00.210
That was a big thing back then.
You know,
nobody talked politics.

574
00:35:00.211 --> 00:35:02.930
She didn't talk fucking religion.
Okay.

575
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:07.670
You talked about sports and what do you like better?
Coca Pepsi,
coke or Pepsi.

576
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.650
Mcdonald's or Burger King.
Those were the big fucking debates back then.

577
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:14.270
And um,

578
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.030
<v 3>okay.</v>

579
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.020
<v 0>I was out.
We Will Mcdonald's fucking family.
We used to go to this Mcdonald's,</v>

580
00:35:20.021 --> 00:35:21.550
I don't even know where the fuck it was.

581
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:27.220
It was like in Peabody or north Redding way back in the early seventies.

582
00:35:27.221 --> 00:35:30.820
It was an off,
it was near these railroad tracks.

583
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.190
And I remember there was these fucking seagulls and pigeons and shit and you'd

584
00:35:36.191 --> 00:35:38.310
be eating outside and then throwing them French

585
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.143
<v 4>fries</v>

586
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.770
and then he got to see a train go by and it was the cool,

587
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:48.720
this is like pre I pads pretty Fuckin,
you know,
Internet.

588
00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:53.040
There was nothing to do.
Cartoons,
we are,
our UHF antenna was busted.

589
00:35:53.041 --> 00:35:56.610
I could only watch cartoons on Saturday.
So this was a big fucking deal.

590
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.780
I'd always get a cheeseburger is small fry and a chocolate shake.

591
00:36:00.781 --> 00:36:04.020
That's what the fuck I had,
you know,

592
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:08.070
for a long fucking time passed when it wasn't filling me up.
You know?

593
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:09.450
But you were afraid of your dad.
It's like,

594
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:11.280
I'm not gonna ask for a quarter pounder with cheese.
I don't know.

595
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:15.060
I don't know what this is going to do to the whole dynamic.
Every,

596
00:36:15.061 --> 00:36:16.350
everybody's in a good mood.
I'm not,

597
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.410
I'm not going to try to fucking go up a size here.

598
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.050
That's how Americans got fed.
Once Dad became dad's,
became their kids' friends.

599
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.020
They weren't afraid to fucking supersize their meals.

600
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.560
The last four years of ordering a cheeseburger,

601
00:36:31.561 --> 00:36:33.600
small fry and chocolate Frake shake.
I was still,

602
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:35.040
I was fucking starving at the end of it.

603
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.550
I ball and my younger brother's cheeseburger like,
you gotta fucking finish that.

604
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:44.970
Hi,
you little fucking gummy bear.
You know,
you fucking teeth.

605
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.110
I'll eat it.
Um,
so anyways,

606
00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:52.290
I saw that thing today and I was just like,
I would fuck it.
I don't,
I'm,

607
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.830
I'm not into junk.
I'm not in this stuff,
but there's something about that thing.

608
00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:00.780
I just think it's fucking cool to get it fixed up.
It was the,
the,

609
00:37:00.781 --> 00:37:03.240
uh,
the fucking base was all bent and shit,

610
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.890
but to fix that fucking thing up,
I was like,
I just,

611
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.070
I also stick down at the end of my driveway.
Had that thing lit up.

612
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:19.420
Well,
my class,
like a,
you know,
Cena,
neighbors would hate us.
It's like,

613
00:37:19.421 --> 00:37:22.430
I know the anus,
I wouldn't have a stick it out there if I had like,
you know,

614
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:28.700
paid some giant fucking house.
Right.
You know,
and there was some sort of,

615
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.110
I dunno what,
you know,
those fucking houses,
those,

616
00:37:33.111 --> 00:37:36.380
those Republicans have them,
you know,

617
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.110
and not saying this is not rich liberals,

618
00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:43.760
but the Republicans live in those states where you can fucking have a house and

619
00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:47.720
then another house on your property.
You know,
you have an old barn,

620
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.100
you know,
when you just let your wife,
your wife gets to fucking house.

621
00:37:52.101 --> 00:37:56.240
Then I'm telling you,
this is my fucking dream,
my dream.
Right.

622
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.100
Um,
you know,
but I mean,
I would love to live.

623
00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:02.570
I can't live out their interracial couple.

624
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:05.830
I can't go out there and to fucking Nazi land,
you know,

625
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.970
and all these fucking people marching around.

626
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.520
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

627
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.870
<v 4>Uh,
but anyways,</v>

628
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.890
I would love to have a fucking old house and one of those states that still has

629
00:38:17.891 --> 00:38:19.990
clean air,
if that even exists.

630
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:25.030
And he just got a giant fucking what used to be a barn.

631
00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:29.350
And on the bottom you'd have your daily driver,

632
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:33.790
your classic car,
and like a fucking sick motorcycle.
All right.

633
00:38:33.791 --> 00:38:36.070
And then up top,
I haven't fucking clothes.
They'd be,

634
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.300
I always told you this be drum room,
fucking place to work out.

635
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.100
And the rest of it is just a fucking cigar bar,
you know,

636
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.760
and did some stupid fucking reason I would find it.

637
00:38:47.761 --> 00:38:50.140
Find a place for that Mcdonald's drive through side,

638
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.143
<v 3>you know?</v>

639
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:57.290
<v 4>But the more my wife hated it,
the more it would drive me into the barn.
Um,</v>

640
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.220
anyway,
so let's read some advertising here for this week,
shall we?

641
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.320
<v 3>Okay.</v>

642
00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.350
<v 4>I always hated at Burger King.
Tried to actually,

Yeah.</v>

643
00:39:06.351 --> 00:39:09.200
And then frozen and driven and a fucking truck across the country.

644
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.670
You know you still,
we showed that in a commercial like this,

645
00:39:13.671 --> 00:39:17.990
sitting there with some fucking open grill back there cooking these fucking

646
00:39:17.991 --> 00:39:19.160
things.
Then I cook it.
These things,

647
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.620
<v 5>hey.

It's our old friends,
old zip.

719
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.503
Are you hiring?

720
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.250
Do you know where to post your job to find the best candidates?

721
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.620
Talk about the challenges of finding great,

<v 4>Brooder how's Ziprecruiter is different with ZipRecruiter?</v>

729
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:26.040
You can post your job to 100 plus job sites with just one click.

730
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.810
Then their powerful technology efficiently matches the right people to your job

731
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.740
better than anyone else.
That's why ZipRecruiter is different.

732
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.080
Unlike other job sites.
Sip,

733
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:44.180
it doesn't depend on candidates finding you.
It finds them.
In fact,

734
00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:46.550
over 80% of jobs posted on Zip.

735
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:48.683
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

<v 4>Okay.
Get a qualified candidate in 24 hours.</v>

737
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.710
No juggling emails or calls to your office.

738
00:44:55.711 --> 00:45:00.060
Simply screen rate and manage candidates all in one place with zip.

739
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:07.830
Um,
easy to use dashboard.
And right now my listeners can post jobs on zip.

740
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.543
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

741
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.130
<v 4>Good.
If I'm running out of ways to do it for free,
that's right.

why would you say all of these fucking places?

746
00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:36.520
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

747
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.810
<v 4>I almost read that.</v>

748
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.280
How is ciprocort had been advertising with me this long and they don't really

749
00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:45.760

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:04.840
Man comes and picks it up.

755
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.560
Avoid the hassle of post office and mail everything from postcards to envelopes

756
00:46:08.561 --> 00:46:10.240

761

I like the horse legs down the street.

762
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:38.720
<v 3>Okay.</v>

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.030
<v 4>Oh wait a minute.
That would mean the other groups where she closes.</v>

764
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.420
I don't like that.
Prude down the street.
I fucked it up.
Anyway.

765
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.450

771
00:47:06.761 --> 00:47:10.150

You know,

780
00:47:39.131 --> 00:47:43.750
I'm one race behind with the Moto GP.
My,

781
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:50.020
um,
I've really fucking enjoy that.
And I actually,

782
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.590
I think I like it better than Formula One because there's all kinds of passing.

783
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:59.170
There's no passing in Formula One,
it seems after,
you know,

784
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.660
as far as the first guy,
that's my big complaint.
And then they're like,
oh,

785
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:07.120
there's all this amazing racing in,
in position four and five and six.
Well,

786
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.990
fucking show that.
Um,

787
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.960
anyways,
let me,
let me just plow ahead here.
Uh,
me undies every,
no,
no,

788
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:19.870
I already did that.
Let me,
let me ask you,
I'll read the questions for this week.

789
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:24.520
This is what we're supposed to be doing.
All right.
Okay.
Boyfriend's Facebook.

790
00:48:24.521 --> 00:48:27.550
All this is never good.
All right.
Hi Bill.
Straight to the point,

791
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:31.990
me and my boyfriend,
we've been together for two years now and we're happy.

792
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:32.920
Smiley face.

793
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:37.120
The thing that concerns me is that a few times on his Facebook messenger,

794
00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:42.121
I saw that he is writing on a weekly basis with an ex college colleague of his,

795
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.060
a beautiful young lady.

796
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:50.080
The thing is that they were close at work back then,

797
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:53.710
but he quit three months ago and I just don't believe in Male,

798
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:58.160
female friendships.
I'm talking from experience also when we were wanting,

799
00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.520
basically if I,
you know,
if we're having a conversation,

800
00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.130
if we're talking eventually we're gonna fuck is what you're saying.

801
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.720
Also when we're watching some videos and stuff on his,

802
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:12.550
on his phone in the search field,
I saw a list of a few girls names.

803
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.080
Other than that,

804
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:18.130
he has been great to me and hasn't shown any signs of a man whore yet.

805
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:23.050
Am I too suspicious or do I have the right to worry?
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

806
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:28.570
I don't fuck it.
That's not enough.
That's not enough information.
Um,
I wouldn't,

807
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.430
you know this ex colleague that's a beautiful lady.

808
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.570
Yeah.
That's where,
that's the right.
That's fucking weird.

809
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:43.060
Um,
I dunno about the,
the fucking phone shit.
That's a,
I have no idea.

810
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.330
I have no idea what that's about.
But that,
that thing there,
yeah,

811
00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:49.420
that's definitely a red flag.
You know what I mean?

812
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.780
Like we'll put yourself in his position if you will fucking,
you know,

813
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:57.781
close with some guy and you left the job three months ago and you're still chat

814
00:49:57.971 --> 00:50:00.760
on Facebook and you know,

815
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.850
here's the thing about women that they can sit there and be like,
oh,

816
00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:06.430
I thought we were just friends.
They seem to be able to get away with that.

817
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.580
But I would always say to the woman I was with them,
it's like,
listen,

818
00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:13.840
can I tell you something?
That guy wants to fuck you.
Okay.

819
00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:18.020
I don't care how much you have in common and how you both like fucking a Rosie

820
00:50:18.021 --> 00:50:22.000
or whatever the fuck it is.
And he really listens to you when you talk.

821
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:26.290
He wants to fuck you.
Um,
yeah.

822
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.660
So I don't know what you do there because you went on his Facebook and you're

823
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:32.120
snooping.
So that's one of the things,
you know,

824
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:35.240
if you're gonna pull that ah ha moment,
you better be right.

825
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:40.610
Because if you're not,
then they get to play the,
you know,
how dare you snoop,

826
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.990
you know,
how dare you fucking snoop on me.
It's just like,

827
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.760
I mean,
don't women have the out?
Why you snooping on me?

828
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.350
Because you have a dick sir.

829
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.360
<v 3>Okay.</v>

830
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.020
<v 4>That's why I trust you.
I don't trust your deck.
All right.
Ms. Dot.</v>

831
00:50:58.021 --> 00:51:02.700
[inaudible] too.
So I,
I,
I would bring it up.
I don't know if you bring it up.

832
00:51:02.701 --> 00:51:05.280
I don't have enough information.
That was a really quick and to the point,

833
00:51:05.281 --> 00:51:07.110
which I,
I really appreciate,

834
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:12.180
but I'm watching some videos and stuff in the search field.

835
00:51:12.181 --> 00:51:16.410
I saw a list of a few girls names.
That's not good either.
I don't fucking know,

836
00:51:16.411 --> 00:51:18.630
but I don't know who the girls are,
but that they are right there that,

837
00:51:18.631 --> 00:51:23.580
that fucking ex colleague think.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

838
00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:27.660
Um,
that seems like a blow job in the future to me.
That's what I,

839
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.440
if I was standing in front of a green screen,
a little meteorologist,

840
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:35.390
it'd be a fucking Dick floating towards a woman with their mouth open down

841
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.740
south.
All right.
Missed opportunity.

842
00:51:37.741 --> 00:51:42.180
Hey Billy Buckaroo I'm going back to school soon.
Within the next week.

843
00:51:42.181 --> 00:51:47.050
Actually I got an offer a couple of days ago to register for a class,
uh,

844
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.720
this upcoming semester.
That is essentially a paid internship.
It,

845
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:55.350
it entailed working with a company called Sun Corp.
Why is my stomach growling?

846
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:58.160
Because I'm on a diet,
um,

847
00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.930
called Sun Corp on a software project.
Uh,

848
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:08.490
if you complete the internship,
you get paid out a couple of hundred dollars,

849
00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.450
like two or 300 and of course something worth putting on your resume for job

850
00:52:12.451 --> 00:52:16.050
hunting.
But the thing is that I turned it down.

851
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.980
I didn't think it would mean that much to take it as I don't really need the

852
00:52:19.981 --> 00:52:22.770
money and software engineering majors are for the most part,

853
00:52:22.771 --> 00:52:25.400
guaranteed a job after graduation.
Plus,

854
00:52:25.401 --> 00:52:28.200
I only have one semester left and it's looking like it's going to be pretty

855
00:52:28.201 --> 00:52:31.800
tough and it's looking like it's going to be pretty tough anyway.
All right,

856
00:52:31.801 --> 00:52:35.340
so you've got a constraint in schools.
What's the problem?
He says,
however,

857
00:52:35.341 --> 00:52:38.700
I cannot help feel a bit pissed off at myself for saying no.

858
00:52:38.701 --> 00:52:42.360
It's one of those things that has virtually no negatives to it.
I get to,

859
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.140
I get work experience and money.
What more could I need anyway?

860
00:52:46.141 --> 00:52:49.650
I can't help but see this as a wasted opportunity.
My question to you is,

861
00:52:49.651 --> 00:52:52.440
have you ever been offered an opportunity in your community career that you've

862
00:52:52.441 --> 00:52:57.120
pissed out pussied out on and then have really regretted later and can you offer

863
00:52:57.121 --> 00:53:00.480
me advice on this?
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.
All right.
First of all,
dude,

864
00:53:00.481 --> 00:53:04.860
it's a fucking internship.
It's your last semester.
It's going to be tough.

865
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.400
You know,
you want to fucking go out and party a little bit.

866
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:09.480
<v 3>Okay.</v>

867
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.200
<v 4>It's not the worst thing.
It's not the end of the fucking world and absolutely.</v>

868
00:53:13.201 --> 00:53:17.670
I had,
um,
oh my God.
You mean all kinds of times?

869
00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:21.630
I pussied out early in my career,
I was afraid.
I was afraid to go on stage.

870
00:53:21.631 --> 00:53:25.830
I was afraid of bombing.
I was afraid of the whole fucking thing.
Yeah.

871
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:29.310
That was a whole bunch of times that I did.
Um,

872
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:34.650
so what I would do,
I started to do in moments like that,

873
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:36.960
if my fucking stomach will start,
I gotta eat dinner.

874
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:40.380
I was good today for lunch.

875
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:45.330
I had lentil soup and a fucking salad and,

876
00:53:45.331 --> 00:53:48.840
uh,
you know,
I've just been trying,
I've been trying,
I'm laying off the booze.

877
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.960
I don't eat fucking sweets,
you know,
the writers room,

878
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:56.600
we have fucking Fridays and where we just ordered whatever we want and a
fucking,

879
00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:00.180
they got barbecue and I just,
you know,
that's like at my age,

880
00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:03.210
that's debts like nap food.
It's really like drinking,

881
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:07.740
like fucking Nyquil assumptions shit.
So I can't do that.
Um,
anyways.

882
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:12.980
Uh,
let's see.
How would,
how would I answer?
Sorry,
just clicked that fucking elbow.

883
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:17.820
Hit the button there.
How would I answer this?
I would basically say when I did,

884
00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:18.780
was I,

885
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:20.310
<v 3>okay.</v>

886
00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:24.210
<v 4>I always remember what it felt like when I pussied out that night.</v>

887
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.510
When I put my head down on the pillow,
my big Charlie Brown fucking head,

888
00:54:27.511 --> 00:54:32.160
I put it down on the pillow and I just would always remember like that awful

889
00:54:32.161 --> 00:54:35.460
feeling of of Pussy and out,
you know?
And then I,

890
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.360
so then the next time that moment happened,
I'd be like,
all right,
tonight,

891
00:54:39.361 --> 00:54:42.510
whether I kill,
whether I bombed,
whether just to,
okay,

892
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.130
I'm going to feel way better.

893
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.640
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

894
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.920
<v 4>Then if I didn't even try.
So,</v>

895
00:54:48.921 --> 00:54:53.000
but I think you'd be in too hard on your cell phone.
This one.
I mean,

896
00:54:53.001 --> 00:54:57.530
you didn't pussy out,
you just said no.
You seemed like you weighed your options.

897
00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.410
If you were too afraid to do it,
then I would say that you post it out.

898
00:55:00.411 --> 00:55:02.780
But I don't think he did.
But,
um,

899
00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.280
I don't know if your reasons for doing it were different.
You know,

900
00:55:07.281 --> 00:55:09.720
if there was some sort of fear involved,
uh,

901
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:14.180
you got to figure out why you did it and then you've got to forgive yourself for

902
00:55:14.181 --> 00:55:18.450
doing it because it's part of like,
you know,
you got to fail to succeed.
Right?

903
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:22.050
You remember that Michael Jordan commercial,
you know,
all low shots.

904
00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:24.100
[inaudible] missed all those shot.

905
00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:26.960
I failed over and over and over and over and over again.
Then is why I succeed.

906
00:55:26.961 --> 00:55:31.410
There you go.
Same fucking thing.
Same fucking thing.
Um,
all right.

907
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:32.720
Nose job,

908
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.220
a dear Billy Mozzarella legs.

909
00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:38.990
<v 7>Um,
wow.</v>

910
00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:42.760
Hello?

911
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.880
<v 4>Yeah,
my daughter yelling at me in there.</v>

912
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.990
She does this hilarious thing when you're on the phone,
you have it on speaker.

913
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:54.540
She sees you talking into it and she just starts going,
well,

914
00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:00.980
what do you yell at about,
I can't find a single pass.
You know,

915
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.060
I was telling them that story of how,
you know,

916
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.330
I did all that stuff for you this morning.
Then you got into a mood.

917
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.180
So then I matched your mood with that,
my mood.

918
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:11.120
And then we had that little game that you play with.

919
00:56:11.121 --> 00:56:15.060
Then you tried to be nice to get me out of my mood.
You know that little thing?

920
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.980
No,
I don't know what you're talking about,
Nia.

921
00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:23.080
I don't know what you're talking about.
Nia.
What do you want me to say?
No,

922
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.033
I'm saying,

923
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:30.450
<v 0>well,
I don't know what he's talking about either.
Nia,
what?
What?</v>

924
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:35.460
What?
Funny game or you know you're going to mood and then,

925
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.500
then,
then,
then it puts me in a mood.
Then you go,
okay,

926
00:56:37.501 --> 00:56:39.150
maybe I've took my mood too far,

927
00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.120
so now I'll be the one to turn it around and then you know me.

928
00:56:42.121 --> 00:56:46.800
You always got to fucking pull me out of the anger.
Mud,
right?
Fine.
Yeah,
sure.

929
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.450
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Can you tell guys you hear in a voice,</v>

930
00:56:50.451 --> 00:56:55.160
I won't look how beautiful you are.
Hey Buddy.

931
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:58.790
How you like the computer?
Anything with the screen on it?
You're like,

932
00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:02.570
what are you yelling for?
What?
Cause you got to have my DNA.

933
00:57:02.571 --> 00:57:07.010
Is that what the problem is?
You realize as you grow up every time you screw up,

934
00:57:07.011 --> 00:57:11.390
I'm going to get blamed for that because I'm the screw up in this relationship.

935
00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.660
That's right.
Talk to the people.

936
00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:19.640
Tell the people,
what's your feeling?
Huh?
What do you got there?

937
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.890
What are your feelings about global warming?
What should we do?

938
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.630
<v 0>The baby's senator was surprisingly quiet on some of the biggest issues out</v>

939
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:38.320
there.
Hey,
how are you liking a,
you love in the Avocados,

940
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:40.480
aren't you the mushed up Avocados?
You liking him?

941
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:46.840
<v 4>She's shy.
She,
she had Mike Fright.
She doesn't know what it is.</v>

942
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.390
It's probably she didn't grab it.
All right,
here we go.
Hey.
Hey.

943
00:57:49.391 --> 00:57:53.200
Someone's going to ask a question about a nose job.
Some reason my fuck,
oops,

944
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:57.730
sorry.
Too many Chrissy.
My stomach is growling.
I'm hungry too.

945
00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:02.390
Yeah.
Alright.
Nose job.
Dear Billy Mozzarella.
Like

946
00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.060
wait,
like the white,
like the Mozzarella.

947
00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:09.640
I'm a 43 year old married father of two.

948
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:16.080
<v 0>Yeah.
He liked it up.
Very happy with my life but could use some advice.</v>

949
00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:19.590
You see I have a Schnoz.
Oh my God.

950
00:58:19.591 --> 00:58:22.020
Do this and your nose is still bugging you at 43.
You're married.

951
00:58:22.021 --> 00:58:26.630
A woman loves you.
You got a couple of kids,
a real honker Oh really?
Big Nose.

952
00:58:26.631 --> 00:58:30.510
A all day.
I got a big nose over here.
Now you want to talk?
Huh?

953
00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:34.350
I been able to get by what?
The successful life coach,

954
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:38.010
career and marriage.
Um,

955
00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:41.480
but in the back of my mind,
okay.

956
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.110
The back of my mind and whenever I look in the mirror I just can't get over my

957
00:58:46.111 --> 00:58:51.060
nose.
I kind of look like old old joke.

958
00:58:51.061 --> 00:58:53.740
Groucho Marx,
all those old joke.

959
00:58:53.741 --> 00:58:58.060
Groucho Marx with the glasses without glasses.
Um,

960
00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:03.140
now my question is
why are you yelling?
I you,

961
00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:06.150
I gave you the floor and you didn't want to talk and now you're yelling there.

962
00:59:06.151 --> 00:59:06.984
Cutie.

963
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.580
<v 4>What are you doing?
Huh?</v>

964
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.430
<v 0>Well,
you say their wrinkles.
My Little Sharpei.</v>

965
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:18.540
Um,
all right,
where am I?

966
00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:20.610
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

967
00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:25.610
<v 4>Now my is being that I've come this far in life and at my age.</v>

968
00:59:26.541 --> 00:59:30.530
Do you think it's super vain or silly to get surgery done?
Money.

969
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.170
Money.
Your wife is not an issue.

970
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:36.440
I just think it's silly of me to really want to do this,

971
00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:40.490
but it's really affecting me where I don't want to look at myself in the mirror

972
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:44.270
when I shave awe or put on contacts.

973
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:47.500
Thankfully vice and go yank gauge.
Let's go.
Yay.

974
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.120
You guys were in New York and New York,

975
00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:56.780
the greatest promo ever.
Wheel of fortune,
if you can ever find it.
Um,

976
00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:59.930
when they went to New York,
uh,
I guess where in New York?
Huh?

977
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.020
That was it.
Two second clip.
Um,
here's a thing too.
I,

978
01:00:07.021 --> 01:00:10.840
I actually don't get surgery.
Yeah,
you got to learn to love yourself.

979
01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:14.750
And here's the thing,
when you got a frigging giant nose,

980
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.980
it's really defined your face.
Like people,
that's what you look like.

981
01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:21.410
And then when you shave that thing down,
you're not,

982
01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:24.470
you're not going to look like yourself anymore.
And people are going to be like,

983
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:27.410
you know,
I bet.
I bet.

984
01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.860
What's wrong with you?
I bet.
Maybe if I talk quieter,

985
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:37.790
I bet that the only person that really has issue with your nose as you,

986
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:43.190
you know,
your wife loves you,
your kids love you.
You got friends,

987
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:48.930
you're fine.
Uh,
I wouldn't do it.
I would do okay.

988
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:52.790
You think you think that I haven't looked into,
you know,

989
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:56.510
whatever Michael Jackson had bleached out of him to put a little bit of that in

990
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:58.780
me so I can walk wears shorts.

991
01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.240
Can I have some of that leftover pigment?
Um,
look,

992
01:01:06.241 --> 01:01:08.160
they always going to have something by yourself that you don't like.

993
01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.780
I am a firm believer in just keeping yourself in shape,

994
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.560
yelling over a baby and,
and basically,
uh,
you know,

995
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:21.780
aging naturally you look way better.
All right.

996
01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:26.210
The liver makes us knows what they're doing.
Uh,
however,

997
01:01:26.211 --> 01:01:29.300
if you're going to go that road road,
I don't know.
I don't know.

998
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.170
You better make sure you find somebody good.
Exactly.

999
01:01:32.171 --> 01:01:33.980
Cause you could end up like that,
that a,

1000
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:37.370
that chick from dirty dancing and I thought it was gorgeous and I loved her
nose.

1001
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:42.630
Yeah.
I love to know.
She looks beautiful.
She died though.
I know she looks,

1002
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:43.550
she looks so cute.

1003
01:01:43.551 --> 01:01:47.420
She got the lead in the movie with that knows Barbara Streisand.

1004
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.830
Who else has a a very strong knows Sarah Jessica Parker.

1005
01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:55.330
Well what or who are the guys that have like strong new Joe Barden,
nick,

1006
01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.310
Joe Barton.
Joe Bark.
Nick.
Yeah.
That was that lady,

1007
01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:00.470
that lady when she made fun of his nose and he said,

1008
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:03.110
you need to lose about 40 pounds before you talk to me,
bitch.

1009
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.960
One of the great lines ever.

1010
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:09.010
And then her husband turned around and when she complained,

1011
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.940
looked at Joe to one look at Joe and then started yelling at me.
I was like,

1012
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:18.680
you fucking,
oh,
sorry.
Um,
I'm not gonna lie.
That's what I would've done.

1013
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:21.060
I would've picked the smaller guy.
Why?

1014
01:02:21.061 --> 01:02:25.760
What do you say when you say pay attention to me?
Man.
Wants to talk to?
Yeah.

1015
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.110
Oh,
you talk to me anytime you want.
All right.

1016
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:32.740
As girlfriend's dad for hand in marriage and he denied.
Oh No.

1017
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.680
Whoa,
whoa.
Okay.
We got to read this one.
Whoa,
baby.
You gotta be quiet.
Okay.

1018
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.790
This one's is riveting.
You got to listen to this one Kiddo.
All right.

1019
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.310
Hi Sir.
Hi Sir.
William Berkeley.
A long

1020
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:50.123
<v 3>okay.</v>

1021
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.620
<v 4>You know what's so funny is the amount of people that are going to say mean</v>

1022
01:02:52.621 --> 01:02:54.120
stuff.
I get it.
She's cute,

1023
01:02:54.121 --> 01:02:58.640
but I swear to God if you bring a kid on that poor kid.
Um,

1024
01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:01.920
all right,
longtime fan.
Uh,
thank you for all the laughs.

1025
01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:04.950
She got me through some hard times and I am thankful that,
all right,

1026
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.330
so I'll thank you very much.
Anyways,

1027
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:09.420
I've been dating my current girlfriend for five years.
Come this November,

1028
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.080
I'm 25 and she is 24.
I've been thinking about proposing,

1029
01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:17.880
so I decided to do an old tradition by asking your father's hand in marriage.

1030
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:21.750
Now that's a,
that's a classy move.
The Dad's like that stuff.

1031
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.100
I also asked your mother to be sure,
uh,

1032
01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.350
to be there as she is very close to both of them.

1033
01:03:28.351 --> 01:03:31.650
I took them out to dinner and I told him how much I loved her and how much she

1034
01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:33.570
means to me,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1035
01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.290
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1036
01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:40.210
<v 4>Once I was done giving my speech,
they just stared at me like I had three heads.</v>

1037
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.980
They didn't give me their blessing to marry their baby and went on saying that

1038
01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:48.910
they don't think that I get along with all the day.

1039
01:03:48.911 --> 01:03:51.160
Don't think that I get along with their siblings well,

1040
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:55.210
and it seemed awkward when we,
the family are together.

1041
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.810
All my God.
Oh,
oh.

1042
01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:02.530
They said that they felt like I would try to move their daughter away from her

1043
01:04:02.531 --> 01:04:07.531
family because of my job and she belongs with her family.

1044
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:08.770
Oh No.

1045
01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:13.770
Should I keep dating hoping that something changes or is that the relationship

1046
01:04:14.021 --> 01:04:18.370
with their parents can't be repaired or should I just give up on this five year

1047
01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:22.810
relationship?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
I call that sucks.

1048
01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.790
Yes.
And I can tell you this right now,
marrying into that.

1049
01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.610
I know that f a nightmare.
That's going to be a nightmare.
Yeah.
You Bet.

1050
01:04:32.611 --> 01:04:36.640
I love this girl because I'll tell you it buddy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That,
uh,

1051
01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:39.580
that sounds like those parents are going to screw up.

1052
01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:44.170
Did they live on a compound that sounds like the Rayburns and bloodline or

1053
01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:48.340
something you're trying to marry into one of those families?
Yeah,
I would walk a,

1054
01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.610
he's got to talk to his girlfriend about it and be like,
listen,

1055
01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.350
I wanted us to be a surprise,

1056
01:04:53.351 --> 01:04:58.330
but I went out and I asked your parents about getting married because I wanted

1057
01:04:58.331 --> 01:05:03.331
to do it the right way and this is what they told me and see what she says like,

1058
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.770
and I think you just kind of go from there.
But yeah,

1059
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.600
the free masons or something,
you know,
you marry into the family too.

1060
01:05:10.601 --> 01:05:13.360
So if you don't get along with them on that level and they're already looking at

1061
01:05:13.361 --> 01:05:18.040
you like,
hmm,
sounds like some blue blood.
Yeah.
Don't know.
You know,
the

1062
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.930
<v 0>hedges never need clipping or way she the youngest is she like what I,
I'm just,</v>

1063
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:26.200
I'm curious as to,
did you not see this coming whatsoever?

1064
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:29.060
Because I would find that a little hard to believe.
Um,

1065
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:32.410
but maybe he hadn't spent much time with,
well,
if he didn't see it coming,

1066
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:35.290
that would mean that he's a dope and maybe that's why they don't want him to

1067
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:36.124
marry the kid.

1068
01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:41.680
Sky's got no anticipation skills.
He doesn't see what's,

1069
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.180
what's the hand in front of his face?

1070
01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.480
Obviously you know that you don't get along with the siblings.

1071
01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.180
I feel like that probably wasn't a surprise to you.

1072
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.540
It sounds like nobody in the family like shoe,
but that woman,

1073
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:57.130
so she's going to have to then make a decision.

1074
01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.570
You or them,

1075
01:05:58.571 --> 01:06:02.830
which is very romantic for somebody in their 20s but eventually as you start

1076
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.470
having kids and stuff,
Christmases and all that are a Gaga.
Oh Dude,
I,
I,

1077
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:08.620
I don't know how much you love her,

1078
01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:13.150
but this would be a great thing to walk away from if you could do,

1079
01:06:13.350 --> 01:06:18.280
that's five years.
That's a long,
now he's 25 it's a five year.

1080
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.130
25 it's Steve shouldn't the first three years he shouldn't have been in a

1081
01:06:21.131 --> 01:06:23.170
relationship.
You gotta be a Free Agent College.
Huh?

1082
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:26.190
You got a Yeti at the lay of the land out there.
I mean,

1083
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.660
no pun intended over there.
Yeah.
Maybe they think you're just too young or,
well,

1084
01:06:29.661 --> 01:06:33.250
no,
they said why they don't approve.
So I think you,
if you are really,

1085
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.540
you got to talk to your girl about it.
They don't like,
ah,
yeah,

1086
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:42.890
you got to talk to your girl and see what she says.
Do a favor.
Just dump her.

1087
01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.840
So then she doesn't know why and then she won't blame her families it because

1088
01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:50.830
you're not going to marry into that.
I would leave.
I would leave right now.
Okay.

1089
01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:53.470
We're moving on to the next question.
I would leave.
No,
you went in.

1090
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.110
He's got a toddler about it.
Oh my twenties I wouldn't have,

1091
01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:57.370
cause I would've been smart enough,

1092
01:06:57.371 --> 01:07:00.610
but in my forties if your family was just like,
yeah,
you know,

1093
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:04.660
we just don't like it,
dude.
And I would just be like,
all right,
well yeah.

1094
01:07:04.661 --> 01:07:07.270
And I agree with that,
but he has to talk to her about it.

1095
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:10.930
That's how you got to tell her what happened.

1096
01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.830
Can you get the little crazy person here crawling all over me?

1097
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.530
She just dropped it.
She just dropped it.
It's right.
It's right here.

1098
01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:24.700
But she's going for the computer.
That lanyard.
So there you go,
buddy.

1099
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:28.480
Here you go.
Okay.
All right.
Let's look at the last one.

1100
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:33.910
Girlfriend's sociopathic mother.
And yet can you give me,

1101
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:34.751
can you give a woman,

1102
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.360
because women never writing to this podcast because I'm such an asshole.

1103
01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:41.380
Can you give some quick advice here?
This woman went on Facebook.

1104
01:07:41.381 --> 01:07:43.990
She's been with this guy for two years.
She said so happy.

1105
01:07:43.991 --> 01:07:47.970
He does everything right.
Everything's fine.
But she checked his Facebook.
Why?

1106
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.090
Because you guys are happy and everything is going okay.

1107
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:56.610
Why did you check to see how much my check was for today?
Huh?

1108
01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:58.150
Oh God,

1109
01:07:58.151 --> 01:08:01.870
I can't believe you're just putting me out on front street like that because you

1110
01:08:01.871 --> 01:08:03.310
guys snoop,
it's what you do.

1111
01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:10.660
Um,
anyways,
I was just curious.

1112
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:14.360
See now you're going to have everybody with the gold digging.

1113
01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.400
W H are he comments?

1114
01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.790
<v 4>That's not why you did it.</v>

1115
01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.970
Cause because we did a job together and you wanted to see what I made versus,

1116
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:26.030
<v 6>yeah.
Job Baggage for the family.
Job Back East for the family.</v>

1117
01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.880
And you wanted to see how much I made first.
What you made.

1118
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:32.870
Obviously I know you're gonna make way more than I make.
Okay.

1119
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.460
I was just happened to be there.
I mean they did request me,

1120
01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:42.220
but that's a whole other story.
Anyway,
boyfriend's Facebook straight to the

1121
01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.370
<v 4>wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
Let's go back to the check there.
Why I want to either.</v>

1122
01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.660
I like watching you twist and the awkwardness that I live in day to day.
Um,

1123
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.850
so anyways,
she goes to check the Facebook messenger and she said,

1124
01:08:53.851 --> 01:08:57.990
I saw that he is writing on a weekly basis with an ex colleague of his,

1125
01:08:57.991 --> 01:09:02.490
a beautiful young lady.
The thing is is that they were close at work back then,

1126
01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.480
but he quit three months ago.
Okay,
keep going.

1127
01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:11.400
That's it.
And what?
I just don't believe in Male,
female friendships.
I'm talking

1128
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:16.360
<v 6>from experience
bap,
bap,
bap,
bap,
bap.
What'd he say?</v>

1129
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:19.570
What'd he say?
Ah.
And what's the question?
What are you doing?

1130
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.550
Go back to when we're watching some videos and stuff on his phone and the search

1131
01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:29.170
few.
I saw a list of a few girls names.
Other than that,
he's great to me.

1132
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:31.960
Uh,
yeah.
Listen,

1133
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:36.400
this is why you don't go snooping and social media and phone because if you find

1134
01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:39.880
something you could,
the thing is if you are looking in that direction,

1135
01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.220
you're looking for something.
So any little thing,

1136
01:09:42.221 --> 01:09:44.770
no matter how innocent is going to get you all fucked up in the head.

1137
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:48.760
So if you're going to go looking for stuff,
you're going to go find stuff.

1138
01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:54.270
So either drop it or confessed that you've been a little snoopy snoop and you're

1139
01:09:54.671 --> 01:09:56.410
paranoid and you're insecure.

1140
01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:00.720
But I think you should just zip it and move on and not look at his,

1141
01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.460
his social media or his phone.
Anyway.

1142
01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:07.270
<v 4>Wow.
I said she should actually ask them about that.
That guy.</v>

1143
01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:10.300
But you're the lady.
I will listen to the lady here.

1144
01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.980
<v 6>Well I said it either one you gotta like fess up and be like,
listen,</v>

1145
01:10:13.981 --> 01:10:18.981
I've been feeling kind of insecure lately and I went in your Facebook and I saw

1146
01:10:19.471 --> 01:10:21.180
that you messenger somebody in.
First of all,

1147
01:10:21.181 --> 01:10:24.600
I apologize for invading your privacy because I wouldn't appreciate it if you

1148
01:10:24.601 --> 01:10:29.070
did that to me.
But second of all,
since I've done it,
but who is this bitch?

1149
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.370
All right.
Girlfriends,
sociopathic.
We Shit.

1150
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:37.980
But you know you're wrong for looking at his Facebook and you know you're

1151
01:10:37.981 --> 01:10:40.860
looking at wrong for looking at his phone.
You're wrong.
You're wrong for that.

1152
01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:43.200
So just know that.

1153
01:10:44.670 --> 01:10:48.180
<v 4>Girlfriend,
sociopathic mother.
Hey Billy boo.</v>

1154
01:10:48.181 --> 01:10:52.500
I can't say that front of that word.
I know,
but still,
uh,

1155
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:56.640
not sure if this is the right place for mm questions,

1156
01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:01.830
but I'm in dire need of redheaded.
See Note,
wisdom.
Uh,

1157
01:11:01.831 --> 01:11:06.150
so I've been dating this lady for about a year now and her mother is a next

1158
01:11:06.151 --> 01:11:09.900
level piece of crap.
Uh,
there are countless examples.

1159
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:14.860
Her SYEP psychopath,
the of a psychopath up.
Wait,

1160
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:18.660
there are countless examples.
Her psychopathic.
Then they always leave out words.

1161
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:23.640
I already read bad enough.
But to trim the fat on the store story,
I'll,

1162
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.360
uh,
I'll cite a couple of scenarios.

1163
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.580
She has repeatedly asked me whether I use protection whilst banging her
daughter.

1164
01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:34.170
And when I responded,
yes,

1165
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.250
she goes on to say she has no evidence that I do use protection.

1166
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:39.760
What

1167
01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:40.870
<v 6>would there be evidence?</v>

1168
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.840
<v 4>Where would there be evidence?</v>

1169
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.220
No effing clue unless you're banging her house and she's checking the wastepaper

1170
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:49.200
basket.
Don't want her daughter to get pregnant.

1171
01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:54.090
I am 21 years old and she is called my mother on multiple occasions to ask to

1172
01:11:54.091 --> 01:11:57.210
meet up with her and my girlfriend dad to talk about my girlfriend and I.

1173
01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:58.590
My mother is obviously declined.

1174
01:11:58.591 --> 01:12:01.380
The invitation is she has continued to grow yet she's continued,

1175
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:04.440
continued to persist.
Other than that,

1176
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:08.970
she is the helicopter parent of the century and calls my girlfriend at least 15

1177
01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:11.520
times a day to tell her how to live her life.

1178
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.680
I hate this woman with a burning passion,

1179
01:12:13.681 --> 01:12:16.170
but I don't know what to do about it with my girlfriend.

1180
01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:20.400
My girlfriend is tried to set boundaries with the mother but it has had no luck.

1181
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.750
We'll just don't answer the phone.

1182
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.590
I think about the future and I never want to see this woman again,

1183
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:30.591
let alone have her be in the law being in law or the grandparent to my children.

1184
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:32.063
I'd love to hear what you,

1185
01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:33.063
<v 6>thanks.</v>

1186
01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.820
<v 4>Thanks.
And go f yourself.
Yeah,
I mean this word,</v>

1187
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.940
this guy's thinking at 21 that other guy should've been thinking at 25 like

1188
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:43.200
you're going to marry into that.
So I mean you're young enough where you know,

1189
01:12:43.201 --> 01:12:44.034
I'm sure

1190
01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.540
<v 6>your girlfriend's only a few years out of the house,</v>

1191
01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:49.930
but she needs to just don't answer the phone.
Yeah,
she just doesn't,

1192
01:12:49.931 --> 01:12:50.830
she's worrying.

1193
01:12:50.831 --> 01:12:55.660
Her daughter's too young and it's gonna like leave her forever and all that

1194
01:12:55.661 --> 01:12:58.240
stuff.
She was like attached.
She's like,
I don't think she's a sociopath.

1195
01:12:58.510 --> 01:13:00.760
Who knows whose kid who,
neither one of us know this woman.

1196
01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:03.430
Neither one of us know this woman.
We don't have enough information,

1197
01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.980
but we're going.
We have to go off of what people write.
So when us,

1198
01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:08.740
that's the only way that we can do,
we have to let go all in.

1199
01:13:08.741 --> 01:13:10.840
It's like when you watch a TV show,
you're just going to watch it.

1200
01:13:10.841 --> 01:13:13.860
You can't be like,
well,
that would never happen if Babb have a bath.

1201
01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:14.780
You just got to like

1202
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.113
<v 4>Dr [inaudible].</v>

1203
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.500
I'm not pretending to like solve somebody's problems within 22 minutes.

1204
01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:22.290
Yo need to stop

1205
01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.210
<v 6>punching her in the face and stop doing math.
Okay.</v>

1206
01:13:26.211 --> 01:13:31.190
When we return.
Yeah.
You got to talk to your girl.

1207
01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.630
Your obviously your girlfriend knows,
but yeah,
you just got to ignore the mother.

1208
01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.920
Yeah,
just ignore.
But yeah,
I know a piece.
If she's,

1209
01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:44.540
if she's calling like 15 times a day and she's asking about their sex life and

1210
01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:47.780
she's calling their parents,
that's really,

1211
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:52.070
that's crossing the line.
Shove it off to buffalo.
Yeah.

1212
01:13:52.071 --> 01:13:56.630
You got to respect your kids.
Uh,
boundaries like their own personal space.

1213
01:13:56.631 --> 01:13:59.720
You can't be calling somebody's boyfriend asking them if they're using

1214
01:13:59.721 --> 01:14:00.201
protection.

1215
01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:03.800
Ask your daughter if she's on the pill and if she's not getting her some

1216
01:14:03.801 --> 01:14:07.220
otherwise,
what are you calling me for a lady?
Yeah.
That's weird.

1217
01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.220
Ah,

1218
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.990
<v 4>Jesus gets you pause out of my pants here,
lady.
All right,</v>

1219
01:14:16.991 --> 01:14:20.470
that is the podcast.
For this week.
Congratulations to me.

1220
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:24.280
But when it all this money on the red sock socks,

1221
01:14:24.281 --> 01:14:27.400
making baseball exciting by gambling,

1222
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:32.980
there's your lesson.
You are so adorable and all you do is smile.

1223
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:39.130
A happy baby.
Be In a good mood all day.
Look at you.

1224
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:42.880
She's getting mobile,
everybody and any things that she sees,

1225
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.730
she wants to get our hands on that she gets her hands on and then she wants to

1226
01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.860
go to something else and I'm going to tell you something right now.

1227
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.450
Nobody can flip over faster than this one.
By the way.

1228
01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:56.020
Shout out to Rick Flair.
I'm hoping he's doing better.

1229
01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:01.000
I heard that he's a recovering and I'm looking forward to seeing them doing the

1230
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:05.620
flare chop.
The flare struck,
the flare flop.
All of it.

1231
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:09.760
Absolute legend.
Um,
we already lost one of the funniest guys of all time.

1232
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:14.080
Jerry Lewis.
Yup.
Dick Gregory.

1233
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:18.700
Do you realize how many stories went with those two guys just today and forget

1234
01:15:18.701 --> 01:15:23.150
about Don Rickles.
That just closes a porthole too.

1235
01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:26.200
Like Sinatra,
the whole rat pack,

1236
01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.900
Redd Foxx,
Richard Pryor,
all of that.
That porthole just closed.

1237
01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:36.130
So I hope somebody made a documentary.
All right.
That's the podcast,
everybody,

1238
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:40.360
or a day type on my dad's save today on the couch.
She was a fiery,

1239
01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.970
the face plant right off.
And I just like,
like lightening quick.

1240
01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:46.660
Nia lightening quick like a freckled pasty Cobra.

1241
01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:51.700
I was able to grab her.
All right.
That's it.
She's turning.
She's going for the,
uh,

1242
01:15:51.701 --> 01:15:53.440
the mixer here.
All right,
you guys.
I will,

1243
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.470
I'll check in union Thursday instead of Nice,
because the kids here.
All right.

1244
01:15:57.610 --> 01:15:59.560
See?
Yeah,
right.
