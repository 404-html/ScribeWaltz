00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.730
Okay.
What's going on?
It's bill burr and it is time for the Thursday afternoon,

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.980
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.020
just checking in on
motherfuck us.

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.660
Um,
how are you,
how was your week going?
Oh,

5
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:23.980
that's love.
Don't let it get you down,
you know?

6
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:26.943
Um,

7
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.350
<v 0>yeah,</v>

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.430
<v 1>I'm recording this fucking Wednesday night.
I got so much shit to do tomorrow.</v>

9
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:37.140
I didn't even realize it.
You know,
it's the usual shit,
you know?

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.610
Um,
I'm just gonna do a bunch of stuff.

11
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:47.320
I was wondering,
is there any way that you could handle the other stuff?

12
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
Oh,
it's good to have this job.
Could you do that stuff?

13
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.290
<v 1>Well,
you know,
I was already had some stuff.</v>

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.080
Honey would be a big help if he could choose to do these stuff.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.020
Do you do put the stuff that you were already going to jail?

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.170
That bullshit.
It happens.

18
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.620
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.780
<v 1>Do you one of those things that happens?
Um,</v>

20
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.000
you know,
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck to tell you guys.
Hey,

21
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.600
I'm starting a Patrion page,
by the way.
I Dunno when it's coming out,

22
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.330
but it's going to be all this extra shit.

23
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.400
<v 1>A bunch of extra shit,</v>

25
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.810
a whole bunch of extra shit and uh,
you know,

26
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:34.060
I guess some helicopter videos and whatnot and some other shit.

27
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.340
This is sort of a pre promotional promotional thing here.
I,
you know,

28
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:40.420
if I was supposed to bring it up,

29
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:43.930
I think I was supposed to wait until I had more shit on the sat.

30
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.930
You know what I mean?
So it'd be worth it.
Worth it to you.

31
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.550
I basically just trying to become this little fucking,
you know,
you have a goal.

32
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.150
Yeah.
Little town.
This is sort of placed that makes little candies,
you know?

33
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.281
<v 1>And they just fucking,</v>

35
00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:01.750
they hang in there despite the fact across the street there's a Mcdonald's or

36
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:04.300
you know,
there's a fucking Walmart Assam Shit.

37
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.820
This just this fucking guy down there.
He repairs shoes,

38
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.580
whatever the fuck he does.
That's all I'm trying to do in this business.

39
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.160
She's trying to have my little fucking shop

40
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.470
be bringing enough fucking money on my own.
So these Steven cons out here,

41
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.670
you know,
I can't even tell you some of the shit that I've done.
Like I've really,

42
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:27.400
like a long time ago I saw this documentary and this fucking musician said you

43
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:32.401
are better to own something 100% and sell 20,000 copies then did not own it at

44
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.570
all and sell 20 million.

45
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.400
You're actually going to make more if you just sell 20,000 if it's your own,

46
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.210
if you own it.
And it's one of the truest fuck it things

47
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.340
I've ever,
ever heard other than

48
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.890
<v 0>okay,</v>

49
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.400
<v 1>don't stay friends with your ex girlfriend.
You know,
you break up with a girl,</v>

50
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:57.940
you gotta get the fuck away from her.
Cause uh,
you know,

51
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.890
it's just,
it's,
you know what,
don't listen to me generally speak.

52
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.280
Some of them are cool,
some of them get it,
some are happy for you.

53
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.470
The rest of them,
Jay,
you got to get away from him.
You know what I mean?

54
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.520
It's like when there's mold in the house,
so you got to go,
you're going to die.

55
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.750
Okay.
Does that make sense?
Do I need to sing a song about it?

56
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.920
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

57
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:25.921
All I know is that I am sitting here alone in this God damn rum and my fucking

58
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:34.210
chest hurts.
I think I have a bruised sternum.
This fucking guy,

59
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.560
like the end of last year,

60
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:39.670
he was trying to show me what the fuck happened on this football play and I as

61
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.370
he was coming towards me,
I should have been like,
dude,
I saw it.

62
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.430
I saw the play and he went to pick me up and he fucking compacted my fucking

63
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:53.110
ribs and I think it fucked up my sternum.

64
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.720
Either that or I have to,
I dunno what it is,

65
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:02.800
but you know I'm going to go see a doctor about it.

66
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.180
See what the deal is now that I've fucking been here for like a,

67
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.900
why does this fucking couch scratch ups?
Do they make anything nice anymore?

68
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.410
But these fucking leather couches,
you stick anything on it?

69
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.100
Everything gets all fucked.
That fucking hacked up.
Look at this shit.

70
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.270
Jesus Christ.
Oh,
it gives a fuck.

71
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:28.410
Right?
I guess that adds character,
but it looks like a bunch of hack marks on it

72
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.550
<v 3>anyways.
Um,
college football starts this weekend,
Dat,

73
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.740

76
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.800

77
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.050
<v 5>B,</v>

78
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.810
<v 3>you know,
people have some sort of hand gesture that they fucking throw up,
right?</v>

79
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.053
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

80
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.250
<v 3>Um,
anyways,
Mike,
most beginnings of most college football seasons,</v>

81
00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:11.400
there's not a lot of good games.
Okay.
So the ones you want to look out here,

82
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.430
speaking of,
of,
of his University of Michigan,
Yay.

83
00:05:16.431 --> 00:05:21.420
I'll to the,
there is val yet right against our Notre Dame.

84
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.440
He was and a fucking ass.

85
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.310
Oh he was dying and he said where in one for far kid me,

86
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:34.311
cause I'm a selfish comment and I'm still thinking about me.

87
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.700
I don't even know if that even happened when one for the gipper was that

88
00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:43.530
Hollywood adding a dialog,
some shit that was never said,

89
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.240
you know,
like you complete me.

90
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.843
<v 2>MMM.</v>

91
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.090
<v 3>Anyways,
now the good ones is a Lsu first Miami.
That could be a decent one.</v>

92
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.830
Just as far as ranked teams,
actually each other.

93
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 1>Other than that,
Virginia Tech,</v>

94
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:05.000
Florida State 20 Verse 19 I love it.

95
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:07.640
How the fuck did they do the rankings at the,
so many people leave.

96
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.080
How do they figure out who's what?

97
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.300
You know you can watch number for Wisconsin against Western Kentucky.

98
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.730
We think the spread is on that look at Tcu is not ranked against southern you

99
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.460
Komal frogs.
What happened?

100
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.870
I don't know why I fucking,
I know why.

101
00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:30.840
Because they came to the rose bowl that one time and everybody was dressed like

102
00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:35.220
a fucking douche bag.
Everybody,
all of eating,

103
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.710
all the guys were all dressed like jr Ewing.

104
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.850
You know that this like dress and classy.
Right?

105
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.920
And then there's just like you just a privileged can't and it's neither one of

106
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:51.460
those is probably true.
Well actually dressing classes too.
But the second part,

107
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:52.730
they probably won't even privilege cons.

108
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.170
I probably just looked at them and just judge the shit out of them.

109
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.800
There's probably what really happened.
I bet there's nothing wrong with tacy.

110
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.230
You come all frogs?

111
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.673
<v 2>MMM.</v>

112
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.760
<v 1>I Dunno what they just,
they just,
they just look like assholes.
Not the women.</v>

113
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.090
Just the guys sit there.
You know what I mean?
He's sitting there,

114
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.600
this stupid fucking loafers and a fucking blue blazer.

115
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.390
Who wears that to a football game?
Right?

116
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.320
Why are you dressed like an usher?
I Dunno.

117
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.040
It's amazing how long ago I saw that in the fact that it's still bugs me.

118
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.320
It doesn't bug me as much as how easily these chairs fucking scratch evidently.

119
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.910
Oh,
well
what are you going to do?
You know what I mean?

120
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.400
You know what's funny is I got these chairs,

121
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:44.840
not for a lot of money because they're like,
hey,

122
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:46.730
here's some vintage fucking chairs,
right?

123
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.480
So you know what these old ass fuck first one is zillion dollars for these

124
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:51.920
vintage leather chairs,
right?

125
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.490
So I've got just buy some new ones and I'll put the fucking hack mark cinema.

126
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:57.780
Now every hack mark that's getting goes in it.
Now my,

127
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.470
what happened,
Bill,
was exactly what you said you wanted in your couches,

128
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:08.030
and now that's happening and now you're upset about,
all right,

129
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:11.900
fair enough.
Fair enough.
How about those?
Red Sox,
ah,

130
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.260
born and on the offense,
the bats,
the bats hanging in there,

131
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.550
hanging in there while I pitching staff all goes on the fucking DL.

132
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.120
Chris sale once again is on the 10 day disabled list.

133
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.830
David Price got hit by a line drive.
Oh,

134
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.830
come back or write to the mound,
the x rays when negative,

135
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:35.470
but they're going to take more fucking,
more x rays,
you know,

136
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.660
so we shall see.
That's why my ESPN,
oh,
it's all over.
Or beginning of August.

137
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.970
You never know what can happen with all the fucking injuries.
Um,

138
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.620
so anyways,
I was watching that.
Uh,

139
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:50.550
<v 2>yeah,</v>

140
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.850
<v 1>I'll tell you what my daughter does.
You know,
it's fucking hilarious.</v>

141
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.240
Did I tell you she imitates the old old man noises I make when I pick her up.

142
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.190
I right.
Come on sweetie,
let's go.
And I pick up,
uh,
she looks at me and she goes,

143
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:06.480
ah,
I don't know.
I,
maybe I already told you that story.

144
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.670
I'm old.
I don't remember.

145
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.230
Speaking of all that went to the gym today and after bragging about my perfect

146
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:13.591
form,

147
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:18.390
I somehow threw out my back trying to make sure I was doing the middle of my

148
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.580
back check PZ exercises.

149
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:24.310
So my fucking chest and shoulders wouldn't pull my fucking know.

150
00:09:24.311 --> 00:09:26.640
My chess wouldn't pull my shoulders forward against,

151
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:31.050
I wouldn't fuck up my rotator cuffs,
my rotator cuffs,
doing great.

152
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.230
Then I end up fucking up my back.
I can't,

153
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:38.470
when I think I'm at that age where I got it,
Nah,

154
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.370
I just gotta I gotta you know,
somebody finally said,
I said,

155
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.060
why don't you get a fucking personal trainer and just have him go over there?

156
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:46.440
All the exercises you're going to do.

157
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:49.500
They'll put together a workout plan that tell you how to do the,
the,
the,
the,

158
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.980
the exercise correctly.
And I've always said,
Nah,
fuck that.
Fuck that.

159
00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:59.540
I know what I'm doing.
I know what I'm doing.
You know,
I know what I'm doing.

160
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.540
Because in the eighties I went,

161
00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:05.570
I went over to a friend's house and he's going to,
come on,
let's work out,

162
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.380
make a friend of mine just gave you a bench.
Do this.

163
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.520
Nothing about grip,
nothing about form,
nothing.
Do some curls.

164
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.880
This is good for you.
Didn't fucking know.
And then you'd go to the den,

165
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:17.900
you joined a gym,
right?

166
00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:22.901
You joined Gold's or world gym or whatever the fuck it was right back in the

167
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.890
day.
And then you just see somebody doing an exercise,
you know,

168
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.280
they seemed approachable.
You'd be like,
Hey,
what's that?
What does that do?

169
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.920
And if they seemed intimidating,

170
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.780
you just sort of watch it out of the corner of your eye and then you just start

171
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:39.440
doing it.
He had no idea what you were doing,
what the fuck it was working.

172
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:41.300
You would basically guess what it was doing,

173
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.680
and then you didn't work the opposite muscle and you fucked yourself up.

174
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:48.710
It had I just gone out and got a personal trainer from day one.

175
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.550
If they even fucking existed back in the 80s,
I don't think they did.

176
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.450
You just went to the gym.
Um,

177
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.190
I wouldn't have all of these problems today.
So there you go.
There you go.

178
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.510
Everybody.
You learn how to play drums,
wear earplugs from day one.

179
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:08.480
If you're going to go to the gym,
get a fucking trainer from day one,

180
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.430
learn what the fuck the correct way to do shit.
So you don't end up like me,

181
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.740
end up hurting yourself trying to fix something else.

182
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.900
My fucking shoulder is doing great.

183
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:19.830
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

184
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.440
<v 1>There's nothing worse than thrown out the top of your back.</v>

185
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:24.900
I don't know what it is.
Lower back up,
just so used to that pain.

186
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:28.110
It's like acceptable to toppy it back.
It's fucking,

187
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.200
and I explain it takes your breath away.

188
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.360
So I've been dealing with that off all day,
you know what I mean?
And my Kiddo,

189
00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:40.640
you know,
she likes getting picked up all the time.

190
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.790
So I was making extra old band android,

191
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.410
uh,
anyways,
but it's still worth it.
That pain for a kid is the best.
No worries.

192
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.060
You know,
I'll take that day of the week.
The kids are fucking right.

193
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.980
She's got a great sense of humor and she likes to rough house.
It's,
it's perfect.

194
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.670
It's perfect.
You know.
Oh,
she loves vamp arena,
man.
I got to,

195
00:12:04.671 --> 00:12:07.420
I'm getting sick of that show,
you know?

196
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:08.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.720
<v 1>The fucking little blue chick.
She's always having problems fitting in.
I get it.</v>

198
00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:15.360
She's different.
Every fucking God damn episode.

199
00:12:15.361 --> 00:12:17.430
And then the other two people have to fucking help her out.

200
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.370
You know what she reminds me of?
She reminds me of an addict.

201
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.330
You know where it's always about them and you've got to fail.
No,
no,

202
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.880
you're doing great.
What's the matter?
What's the matter now?

203
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.343
<v 2>You know,</v>

204
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.290
<v 1>I don't really mind it.
Fancy.</v>

205
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:37.280
Nancy's the one I don't like that one fucking chicken all.
She's,

206
00:12:37.281 --> 00:12:39.940
she's just sitting there and you all she's about as material thinks.

207
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.220
She always tried to have the nicest shit.

208
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.950
She somehow gets status and then give friends or whatever is like,

209
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.920
what the fuck are we watch?
I don't want to watch this shit.
You know?

210
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.850
So instead I was watching a little bit of the red sox with my daughter before

211
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:53.770
she went to bed.
And then,
um,

212
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.530
<v 2>okay.</v>

213
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.790
<v 1>Afterwards,
uh,
you know,</v>

214
00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:01.380
it's funny actually nodded off when I was watching vampire arena.

215
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.610
And you have like that panic when you fall asleep,

216
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:08.040
like three seconds that you kids like walking up to an alligator or some shit.

217
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.790
And I just opened my eyes and she was just looking right at me and she,

218
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.840
and I opened my eyes.
She just looks at me and she just goes,
hi,

219
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.310
what's up buddy?
Sorry.
Oh,

220
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.300
fucking old freckles nodded off too.
So anyways,

221
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.010
I put her to bed and I went on Instagram and I saw Joe Rogan was promoting a,

222
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.990
or just talking about,
oh,
we just watched this documentary about Leonard Skinner.

223
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.073
<v 2>Okay,</v>

224
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.100
<v 1>sorry for the Onyx.
I was like,
God,
I gotta check this shit out.</v>

225
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:43.740
And I just watched it on showtime.
It's called,
if I leave here tomorrow,

226
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.830
um,
and I gotta tell you,
man,

227
00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:49.830
these fucking old southern guys that is still around.
I mean,

228
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:52.200
I literally had to put on the,
the,
uh,

229
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.020
the closed caption so I can understand what the fuck they were saying.

230
00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.360
And Jesus Christ,
incredible documentary.

231
00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:03.060
But it's also amazing at how similar,

232
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.610
you know,
so many of these bands stories are,

233
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.820
and it's just because they get into that,

234
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.230
they get into the music business where they getting fucking ripped off and they

235
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:19.520
just put them on the wheel and the business just gives a shit about money and

236
00:14:19.521 --> 00:14:23.930
they don't give a fuck if they run a band into the fucking ground because

237
00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:27.540
there's always another band that they can sign.
And plus who,

238
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.240
why would you want to rep an old band?

239
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.850
They know all the tricks and how you're going to try to steal from them.

240
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:37.010
They'll probably try to get the rights to their music back,
so fuck up,
you know,

241
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.331
then he locked,

242
00:14:38.331 --> 00:14:41.330
they'll blame each other and break up and then we'll move on to the next band.

243
00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:45.320
Like that's literally how the music fucking business worked.
Um,

244
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.590
so I'm sitting there watching this shit and um,

245
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.720
just,
you know,
that whole,

246
00:14:52.721 --> 00:14:56.170
just the work ethic and just keeping it simple in the beginning and then they

247
00:14:56.171 --> 00:14:57.880
just get stuck in the,
uh,

248
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.720
the craziness of touring.
I don't want to ruin any of it,
but definitely,
uh,

249
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.110
definitely check it out.
And just also how great the band sounds in the night.

250
00:15:07.111 --> 00:15:12.090
Just seeing people singing live and playing live with other human beings is

251
00:15:12.091 --> 00:15:15.780
incredible.
I don't know,
man.
I'm kind of going off the rails here,
dude.
I'm just,

252
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.643
I'm just,

253
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:22.020
I can't remember the last time I watched something from this century,

254
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.420
by the way.
I've been watching that Peter Gunn on me TV bed at eight.

255
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.570
Dude,
dude,
dude,
it,
that's where that song came from,
right?

256
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.960
That is the worst lit show in the history of anything that was ever fucking lit.

257
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.430
At first.
I thought it was like a style thing.
Like for you,

258
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.030
if you guys don't eat the business here,
like when they go to light a scene,

259
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.540
I never understood why this shadow was like a big full gives a fuck up.

260
00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:55.830
There's a shadow.
Right?
But it's just like if you know,
if you're in a room,

261
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.770
<v 6>okay,
like if,</v>

262
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.170
<v 1>I don't know,
I don't even know how to explain this cause this,</v>

263
00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:04.290
this is really beyond my ability.

264
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:08.640
All I know is that's what's so fucked up is they'll be in a dimly lit room and

265
00:16:08.641 --> 00:16:12.050
one person's talking and then this is a shadow behind him and then somebody

266
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.950
right behind them,
like wrecked directly cross talk for them.
So if anything,

267
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.650
the shadow,
that person should be on the person talking,

268
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.960
but one of them they turn around to go to that person.

269
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.820
Then that person has a shadow behind them.

270
00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:26.610
They literally had like one light and they just would stick it in front of

271
00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.740
people.
So this episode ends

272
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:30.820
<v 2>okay.</v>

273
00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.120
<v 1>I'm not saying it's a bad show,
it's just a badly,
poorly lit lit show.</v>

274
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.800
This woman standing there and because she's standing in like,
uh,

275
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.790
the opening to this apartment building where it,
uh,

276
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:44.120
<v 6>okay.</v>

277
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.480
<v 1>It's not straight on the walls.
They sorta angle in towards the door.</v>

278
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:49.610
Her shadow was on both sides.

279
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.030
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.970
<v 1>When she's standing there and don't just saying,
okay,</v>

281
00:16:54.971 --> 00:16:57.910
maybe that's how they lit the building in which she standing.
All right.

282
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.910
Then she walks,
it's the end of the episode.
She goes down the street.

283
00:17:00.911 --> 00:17:05.680
Now we're behind her and as she's walking away,
as the camera rises up,

284
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.390
you literally see the shadow of the camera and the fucking guy,

285
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.480
the guy's head and body hanging off the side off going off the building in the

286
00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:17.620
background that she's walking towards.
And it's like,

287
00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:19.600
how the fuck did somebody missed that?

288
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.900
<v 6>So,
um,</v>

289
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.470
<v 1>but you got to watch Peter Gunn.
All right?
It's on me TV.</v>

290
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.470
I still highly recommend it.
It's fucking hilarious.
You,

291
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.550
you will never see a character die faster.

292
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:34.820
<v 2>Okay?</v>

293
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.480
<v 1>They only had fucking 22 minutes to have somebody get killed,</v>

294
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.560
to have Peter Gunn to try to figure out with what the fuck happened to have

295
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:44.660
Peter get the living shit kicked out of him.

296
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.970
And then for him to solve the fucking murder,

297
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.390
they had to do all of that in 22 fucking minutes.
So it always just starts.

298
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.690
One of them started there like,
ladies and gentlemen on piano,

299
00:17:55.691 --> 00:17:58.940
please welcome 88 keys.
Ketty whatever the fuck his name is.

300
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.230
And the curtain comes up.

301
00:18:00.231 --> 00:18:02.780
And the guy's just sitting there with this weird look on his face.

302
00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:06.360
And then he just keels over with a knife in his back and then it just goes

303
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:08.980
banner.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Why?

304
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.470
<v 2>Okay,</v>

305
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.830
<v 1>so another one,
a guy gets on a fucking elevator and the elevator stops.</v>

306
00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:18.140
He's pushing the button and he's like,
what the fuck's going on?

307
00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:21.950
And all of a sudden the trapdoor above it opens up in a gun with a silencer,

308
00:18:21.951 --> 00:18:25.310
comes through.
Fucking guy drops down,

309
00:18:25.311 --> 00:18:29.720
debt goes down to the first floor,
opens up,
the guy reacts to the dead body.

310
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.780
They,
that was it.
Then they're right in there.

311
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.130
And I gotta Tell You,
Peter Gunn is sort of the precursor to that.

312
00:18:46.131 --> 00:18:49.010
David Duchovny minimalist style of acting.

313
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.293
<v 2>MMM.</v>

314
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.840
<v 1>Guy Crushes it.</v>

315
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.240
<v 2>Okay.</v>

316
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.520
<v 1>And then also 77 sunset strip,</v>

317
00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.300
they would do foreshadowing to the middle of the episode like you saw at the

318
00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:04.660
beginning of Goodfellas and a lot of Martin Scorsese movies,
everybody always,

319
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.410
I always think,
oh,
they're ripping off Martin Scorsese.
I'm like,
wait a minute.

320
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.750
77 sunset strip did this shit.
Maybe he watched a few episodes.

321
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.750
I don't know.
This is Lucy.
We see what this podcast is becoming.

322
00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:20.270
This is becoming an old fucking man.
I got to,

323
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.910
what are you guys watching that's worth watching?

324
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:23.800
<v 2>Okay,</v>

325
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.700
<v 1>I don't know what it is cause my wife dominates the TV.
I love it at death.</v>

326
00:19:27.701 --> 00:19:30.400
What am I going to say?
No.
And she's literally sitting there,

327
00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:33.420
she's watching that Andy Cohen show where all the,

328
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.330
the little old ladies get together with their fucking 20 pounds of makeup and

329
00:19:37.331 --> 00:19:41.590
they just start fucking saying mean shit to each other.
I liked one of them.

330
00:19:41.591 --> 00:19:42.640
One of them was a drunk,

331
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.850
clearly was a drunk and they would tell on her that she needed to go into Rehab.

332
00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.500
She goes,
I don't need to go in and Rehab.

333
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.210
And I'd probably say now went into Rehab was was my cousin and that was because

334
00:19:52.211 --> 00:19:53.800
you know they,
you know,
she didn't,

335
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:58.440
she go to jail was saying like that's why you go to Rehab.
And they were like,

336
00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:02.190
yes,
but sometimes you have to go to rehab because you have a problem.

337
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.610
Well I don't have a prominent guy.
Yeah,
I'm not going to prop.

338
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.750
That's what she does.
She,
she did the fucking

339
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.980
Archie bunker like fuck you guys.

340
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.160
And you could just hear in her voice,
even if she wasn't drunk,

341
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.230
just like she,

342
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:24.000
she's at that level of booze with a bottle has like a fucking handle.

343
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.400
You know,
it's like a jug.

344
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.090
You buying that cheap shit with like a carton of cigarettes.

345
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.800
There is something to be said.

346
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

347
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.310
<v 1>For going out like that,
you know,
to just give in to all of it.</v>

348
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.980
Sugar,
salt,
liquor,
fucking smoke.

349
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.043
I Dunno.

350
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:51.450
I think it's all good right up until you get sick and then you die.

351
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.030
Then you're like,
ah,

I could have been fucking,

352
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.850
I should have jogged an eight apricots,

353
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.870
<v 6>you know,

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.770
<v 1>I mean if it really is just a blink of the eye.</v>

355
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:06.970
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.390
<v 1>Well you know,
as far as how long the universe has been here,
oh Geez.</v>

357
00:21:11.391 --> 00:21:14.600
I'm going deep now.
Right.
Deep.
For me anyways,

358
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.450
if it really is a blink of the eye,

359
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.320
just the amount of time that human beings have walked the earth,
you know,

360
00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.650
who gives a fuck

361

if you live to be 30 Oh fucking a hundred right.

362
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.500
Well,

I guess the person

363
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.010
cause for you,
that's a long fucking time or really short time,
right.
Not Saying,

364
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.530
you know,
I wouldn't give a fuck if I was dying.
I'm just saying,

365
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.730
you know what I mean?
You know,

366
00:21:46.731 --> 00:21:50.210
I'm really saying is that I've been eating like an angel and I barely been

367
00:21:50.211 --> 00:21:53.900
drinking and uh,
trying to get my abs back here.

368
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.310
And uh,
this is one of these nights where,
uh,
you know,

369
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.123
<v 6>I dunno,</v>

371
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:08.980
like my late night snack now is,
is heirloom tomatoes.

372
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.410
I just cut a few of them up and I actually fucking look forward to it.

373
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.060
I liked drinking smoothies in the morning.

374
00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:23.570
I fucking love that for breakfast with Kale and spinach,

375
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.230
bananas and fucking Chia seeds and all of that shit.

376
00:22:27.231 --> 00:22:29.240
But every fucking once in a while,

377
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.463
<v 6>you know,</v>

378

You know,

381
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.550

384
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:01.320
<v 2>Okay.</v>

385
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.210
<v 1>It's weird because I haven't eaten any fucking,</v>

386
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.940
I haven't eaten any fucking ice cream cookies,

387
00:23:08.941 --> 00:23:12.390
And I'm not thinking about any of that at all.

388
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.370
But booze is the one that always,
it always comes back knocking,

389
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:19.783
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

the American or the American first marriage in 1957 at the age six date to a 31

426
00:25:21.791 --> 00:25:26.410
year old called George Scott,
former first baseman of the Boston red sox.

427
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.380
I'm the union lasted for seven years,

428
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.340
the longest and happiest if any of her marriages since then,

429
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.950
things have tended to go downhill.

430
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:37.570
<v 2>Okay.</v>

431
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.201
<v 1>Oh,
that's funny.</v>

432
00:25:38.201 --> 00:25:43.000
She got divorced at 23 for the first time when she went on to marry 23 times.

433
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.940
I'm over the subsequent decades.
She'd married a one eyed convict,

434
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.260
a preacher,
a bar,
man.
It sounds like an Irish song.

435
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.250
They're green alligators and the one eyed conduct.

436
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.760
A fucking preacher and a bar man and a plumber and musicians,

437
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.840
plural.
Oh Jesus.

438
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.430
Two turned out to be homosexuals too.

439
00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:12.860
Are homeless at one beat her.
I mean,
that's pretty good,
man.
You only got beat.

440
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.820
You get married 23 times.
You only get beat once a minute.
It's pretty good.

441
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.710
You forget somebody's got married 23 times.
They just had bad choices in men.

442
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.120
Another put a padlock on her fridge.
Oh,

443
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.090
there's a guy that's called marrying for looks

444
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.860
<v 7>getting fat.
They are hunting.
I swear to God you have another fucking best get.</v>

445
00:26:32.861 --> 00:26:35.350
I'm putting a padlock on that fucking fridge.

446
00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.580
<v 1>Watch me,
watch me.
And then he fucking does it.</v>

447
00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:43.740
And then she have to go fuck yourself.
I'm Outta here.
Who's too controlling?

448
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.600
He was counting the level,
the amount of pop tarts I was eating.

449
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.500
Um,
okay.

450
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.290
One marriage lasted just 36 hours because the love just wasn't there.

451
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.860
But Linda from Indiana once married the same man,

452
00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:01.440
check girly three times.

453
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.080
She's had seven children by or different husbands and has been a stepmother to

454
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:11.970
many more.
Her last marriage a decade ago was a publicity stunt.
It was to,

455
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:13.650
<v 2>yeah.</v>

456
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.910
<v 1>Glenn Wolf,</v>

457
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.710
who and taking Linda as his bride meant he was the world's most married man at

458
00:27:19.711 --> 00:27:23.520
29 times,
29 times on Jesus.

459
00:27:23.521 --> 00:27:24.960
He died a year later at 88

460
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:26.360
<v 2>hmm.</v>

461
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.630
<v 1>I bet.
God's first fucking statement to him is,
what the fuck were you?</v>

462
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.730
Fuck are you doing?
What was that?
Were you an asshole

463
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.540
after 17 times?
Did you really think the last 12 times are going to be different?

464
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:46.500
Your fucking moron.
No sense sending you to hell buddy.

465
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:49.170
You've already been there.
Come on in.
Alright.
Consequently,

466
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.240
consequently she said she was,

467
00:27:51.241 --> 00:27:55.560
that she was on the lookout for number 24 she told the son,

468
00:27:55.561 --> 00:27:59.250
it's been years since I walked down the aisle.
I miss it.

469
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.460
<v 2>Okay.</v>

470
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.350
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
She's like fucking,</v>

471
00:28:02.351 --> 00:28:04.390
she's like an athlete that doesn't know how to retire.

472
00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.690
The serial bride who now lives in a retirement home,

473
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.380
said she had never cheated on a husband you didn't have fucking time to.

474
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.230
She said if she had her life over again,

475
00:28:14.231 --> 00:28:17.170
she would never ever marry so many men.

476
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.150
<v 2>Okay,</v>

477
00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.950
<v 1>let it ended.
Kind of sad,
right?
So of course,</v>

478
00:28:21.951 --> 00:28:23.690
this is all of these clickbait sites.

479
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.860
What should every architect demand from a cloud?

480
00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.140
<v 2>Okay?</v>

481
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.540
<v 1>The most dangerous species alive,</v>

482
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.840
Donald Trump in his younger days.

483
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:36.480
<v 2>Okay.</v>

484
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.090
<v 1>This mom never fed her daughter carbs.</v>

485
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.750
Which one do you guys want here?
This is like jeopardy for dumb people.

486
00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.250
Volkswagen CC test.

487
00:28:48.251 --> 00:28:52.360

Final moments they never expected.

491
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.360
Oh,

This isn't news.

492
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.230
This is a new segment is a new segment called clickbait.
All right.

493
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:21.231
This is the last known picture of the RMS RMS titanic on the surface of the

494
00:29:21.571 --> 00:29:23.640
ocean.
Yeah,

495
00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:26.730
cause we found the fucker was taken during her maiden voyage,

496
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.770
had crosshaven Ireland

497
00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.410
just after the vessel departed Queenstown where it stopped before heading

498
00:29:35.411 --> 00:29:36.880
westward towards New York.

499
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:42.270
Three days after this photo was taking 1,514 would be dead and the titanic would

500
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:47.170
beat titanic would be at the bottom of the North Atlantic after colliding with

501
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:52.171
an iceberg and one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.

502
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:55.303
<v 2>Okay.</v>

503
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:59.300
<v 1>How the fuck did you hit one of those goddamn things?
I guess it was nighttime.</v>

504
00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.780
I didn't have the lights on.
You know,
sometimes you're driving down the street.

505
00:30:02.781 --> 00:30:06.920
You had no idea.
Okay,

Okay.
And they got three advertising.

506

507
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.470
Fucking microchip.
Alright.
Andrew Mccauley,
2007 well,

508
00:30:15.471 --> 00:30:16.221
this doesn't look good.

509
00:30:16.221 --> 00:30:20.690
This is the last known photo of Andrew Mccauley and Australian sea actor who is

510
00:30:20.691 --> 00:30:25.691
now presumed dead Mccauley attempted to Kayak 994 miles across the Tasman sea in

511
00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:33.960

And how the fuck did they get that picture?

512
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.110

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.540
<v 1>Where's The Tasman?
Is that between Tasmania and Australia?</v>

516
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.690
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

517
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.150
<v 1>Fuck all the Australians that are acting like I'm dumb right now.
Okay.</v>

518
00:30:47.151 --> 00:30:48.950
You're at the bottom of the fucking world.
I don't know.

519
00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:53.560
I don't know what goes on down there.
Taz,

520
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.470
man.
See maybe,
I guess correctly the Tasman Sea.

521
00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.350
The Tasman Sea.

522
00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:01.740
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

523
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.540
<v 1>Oh,

524
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.230
Jesus Christ in a fucking boat that's like designed to tip over.

525
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.020
Yeah,
I mean,
you know.
Okay.
All right.

526
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:16.340
Well he definitely was trying to protect his skin.
All right.
Freddie Mercury,

527
00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.320
1991 oh Jesus.

528

<v 2>Yeah.</v>

529
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:23.810
<v 1>Looks like an old peewee Herman for any mercury was the lead singer of Queens.</v>

530
00:31:23.811 --> 00:31:26.540
He died of complications of age related to AIDS.

531
00:31:26.541 --> 00:31:30.200
He was key confirmed the day before he died that he had contracted the disease.

532
00:31:30.201 --> 00:31:35.010
This is the last known photo.
All right.
Why the fuck would I want to see that?

533
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.490
That's an arguably the greatest front man of all time.
Amelia.
Yeah.

534
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:45.260
45 days before she embarked on an infamous flight that would render her both

<v 1>What did it fucking collide with Paul Revere.</v>

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.110
This is the wreckage of the American battleship Maine,

550
00:32:32.111 --> 00:32:34.900
which was destroyed along with 260 members of the vote,

551
00:32:34.901 --> 00:32:39.010
Blah Blah likely by a mine.

anyways,
let's get back.
Let's talk about,
uh,

571
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.020
I don't know what the fuck else to talk about.

572
00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:06.050
If I had done a fucking half hour at this point.
You know,

573
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:10.070
I think every once in a while you should have,
oh shit.
34 minutes,

574
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:16.190
34 minutes of,
I don't know what the fuck that was.
Sorry guys.

575
00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:16.641
I had to,

576
00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:19.460
I had to get this thing done because I got all this other bullshit I have to end

577
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:22.490
up doing when tomorrow.
You know,
I,

578
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.640
I would like to think that the woman getting married nine Zillion fucking times.

579
00:34:25.641 --> 00:34:29.810
Maybe there was a little bit of humor in there.
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.710
Did the fucking news.
Nowadays it's just too goddamn depressing.
I just,

581
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:38.050
I don't know how you guys do it.
How do you stay informed?
Oh,

582
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.520
congratulations to Dean del Rey.
Everybody who got his first,

583
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:45.380
first Conan O'brien went over there for the taping.
He fucking killed it.

584
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.980
It was broke.
It was Mark Marin who fucking ripped on guitar.

585
00:34:48.981 --> 00:34:51.500
He got to find that clip after he killed it on the couch.

586
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.980
He then went over and Jan with the band and fucking play guitar at a whole other

587
00:34:57.531 --> 00:35:01.880
level,
um,
Dene.
Bert Kreischer killed it.

588
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.070
And then Dean del Ray was fucking unbelievable.
A former officer,

589
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:11.930
Roy Oliver,
sentenced to 15 years and fatal shooting of teen.
Holy Shit.

590
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.410
A cop went to jail.
You don't see that often,
do you?

591
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.140
<v 2>Okay.</v>

592
00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:21.640
<v 3>Code of silence,
the Blue Code.
All right.
What happened here?</v>

593
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:24.370
A former Texas police officer role in,
in Texas.

594
00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.510
Roy Oliver was sent us to 15 years in prison on Wednesday for the birder of

595
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.050

596
00:35:32.051 --> 00:35:34.600

Fresh

598
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:42.990
<v 1>freshmen,
Jordan Edwards.
All right,
hang on one second.</v>

599
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.680
Let me see something.
Jordan Edwards.

600
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.740
Dean shot.
Oh,

601
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.000
I thought it was gonna be a white kid.

602
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.470
So they actually sent a cop to jail for fucking killing a black kid.
Oh,

603
00:35:58.471 --> 00:36:01.980
there you go.
Miracles never cease.
Not shitting on the cops.
I'm just saying,

604
00:36:01.981 --> 00:36:06.060
you know,
there's bad comedians.
There's bad cops,
you know.
Um,

605
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.780
anyways,
oh Jesus.
They probably just got myself.
I just,

606
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:12.030
why we just got myself a ticket right then and there.
I swear to God,

607
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:15.630
I'll tell you right now,
that bald,
fractured motherfucker

608
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.610
<v 7>drives a half fucking mile over the speed limit in my county.</v>

609
00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.540
How dare he suggest that?
Uh,
even though human beings are flawed,

610
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.730
that maybe some of them are in my own.

611
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.140
<v 1>Why am I picking on southern people there?
I don't know cause I'm limited.</v>

612
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.760
Um,
all right,
I'm going to read some advertising here.
Whenever the fuck I get it,

613
00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.300
I'll probably read it tomorrow morning.
Um,

614
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.000
if I'm only here to Maru,

615
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.550
um,
that's another thing too.

616
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:51.720
I watch all these old shows on me TV and everybody's drinking and smoking and

617
00:36:51.721 --> 00:36:55.260
then I'm watching this whole thing on Leonard Skinner and everybody's drinking

618
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:58.500
smoke or do it.
Oh,
this fucking shit.

619
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.280
And uh,
yeah,
it starts giving you ideas.

620
00:37:03.281 --> 00:37:07.900
Maybe if I got to start watching a workout shows,
maybe I should do that.

621
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.690
Are their workout shows whatever happened to the biggest loser?
You know,

622
00:37:10.691 --> 00:37:14.380
what happened is the fucking guy on there had a goddamn heart attack figure that

623
00:37:14.381 --> 00:37:18.470
one out.
And the other woman,
I don't know where she went,
she broke off.

624
00:37:18.471 --> 00:37:21.710
She went solo and she started doing her own exercise videos,

625
00:37:21.711 --> 00:37:23.330
if I remember correctly.
All right.

626
00:37:23.331 --> 00:37:25.580

638

639

645
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:35.950
You can get on.
I'll just sit here.
Uh,
owning a couch from hell is like a rite

646
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.990
<v 8>of passage.
I eat too expensive,
too heavy,
too cheap to Warren.</v>

647
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:44.380
I'm going to get out so don't die without the park.
And they see,
oh,

648
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:48.710
you've got to pull it from the curb.
I just destroyed your door.
Um,

Ice Live with Bobby Kelly and he used to fight fucking find them on the sidewalk

651
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.021
in New York City.

652
00:38:56.021 --> 00:39:00.340
So I had no idea what sort of crack head slapped and fucked on the thing.

653
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:03.130
But then after you had a bowl of cereal on it,
somehow it was yours.

654
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.280
Was that personal enough?

764
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:50.160
<v 7>We ended up watching something on TV,
one of the sickest stories ever.</v>

765
00:46:50.161 --> 00:46:52.260
And we're like,
dude,
this has to be a fucking movie.

766
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:56.550
The mega star who was Benjamin button,
that money balls,

767
00:46:56.551 --> 00:47:01.380
Billy Bean is now interested in playing none other than Jimmy Keane.

768
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.900
And uh,
of course in the end they,
they,

769
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.410
they said that they were gonna turn into a movie was basically about this guy,

770
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:11.370
right?
It was this fucking show about serial killers.

771
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.430
So of course we're going to watch it.
In 1993,

772
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.510
Jesse was a high school sophomore devoted to home and family.

773
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.630
Jessia was really very much of a home body.

774
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.600
So one bike ride up the road and back she was done.

775
00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:29.830
So we'll watching this thing about fucking serial killers and the whole time

776
00:47:29.831 --> 00:47:32.550
that talking about this drug dealer kid,

777
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:36.010
well I kind of fucked as this and they keep showing this serial killer guy.

778
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.360
It's like does in the show in the drug dealer,
older,

779
00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.130
you know,
and not in jail and all that shit going,
what the fuck happened?

780
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.240
You know,
just the way they put it together,
you was,
you riveting.
You know,

781
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:50.350
like what the fuck is going on here?

782
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:55.270
So basically what happened was there was this kid,
right,
he played football,

783
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.810
they call them the assassin because every game he ever played,

784
00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:01.660
he took somebody out,
right.
Was it the assassin?

785
00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.320
<v 9>Are they called you the assassin in football?
That was a good thing.
I take it.</v>

786
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.180
Yes.

787
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.920
<v 7>Was that Jack Tatum?
Check Tatum.
Now I forget what it was.</v>

788
00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:14.740
Something like assassin.
So

789
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.280
he fucking,
uh,
and just movie star good looks.
All right.

790
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.260
And he's The star of the football team.
All the women loved him.
I mean,

791
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:29.210
this guy was just like,
he,

792
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.260
he looked like a movie star in his life was a movie.

793
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.090
So he's Big Achilles heel was,

794
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:38.290
he didn't have money and he wanted to keep up with the rich kids.

795
00:48:38.291 --> 00:48:42.190
So we started dealing drugs and he ended up being really good at it.

796
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.620
And by the time he was like 20 years old,

797
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.190
this fucking guy was making like $1 million a year

798
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.310
<v 10>expanded to cocaine.
And at the tender age of 17,</v>

799
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.890
he moved to Chicago where the business and profits exploded.

800
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:02.270
He was now a big fish in a bigger pond,
Lake Michigan to be exact.

801
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.540
He was his own in-crowd fast cars,

802
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.300
faster women and souped up living

803
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.880
<v 9>all the hot spots,
all the big nightclubs,
all the owners I was in tight with.</v>

804
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.510
Um,
I would come in there and have carte blanche and every place that I went to

805
00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.340
where you feeling invincible?
Yeah,

806
00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:21.400
there was a certain point where I would say there was an invincible feeling

807
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:27.160
<v 7>in almost seemed like this American greed type story as opposed to this serial</v>

808
00:49:27.161 --> 00:49:27.581
killer thing.

809
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:31.030
And they keep going back to this serial killer fucking piece of shit.

810
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:33.430
Who's killing these girls?
These teenage girls.

811
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.170
So long story short,
he's laying in bed one night and he's just thinking,

812
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:41.290
I got to get out of this life.
I'm so sick of looking over my shoulder.

813
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.110
I can't do this anymore.
How am I going to get out of his?

814
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:45.250
But he's addicted to the money.

815
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:47.470
He's addicted to the life and all of that type of stuff.

816
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:51.070
And he has this rattling on the door and I'm thinking,
oh fuck,

817
00:49:51.071 --> 00:49:55.150
it's the serial killer.
And he obviously fought the guy in one.

818
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.080
What the fuck happens,
right?
All of a sudden the door fucking

819
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.910
<v 9>boom,
the whole door just blew off the hinges and come flying into the house.</v>

820
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.790
And all of these DEA,

821
00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:09.350
FBI and locals all came in and single file line with their automatic weapons.

822
00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.100
<v 7>Yeah.
Was that alcohol,
tobacco farm?
And I don't know what the fuck it is.</v>

823
00:50:13.101 --> 00:50:17.200
So anyways,
they fucking come.
FDA Food,
Drug Administration,

824
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.160
the uh,
transit Chicago Transit Authority,

825
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:23.110
I don't want to fucking is whatever the fuck that thing is.

826
00:50:23.111 --> 00:50:27.410
They come fucking blast.
And through the door run up,
you know,

827
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:31.370
a bunch of guys with the fucking minor helmets on with the fucking Uzis from a

828
00:50:31.371 --> 00:50:33.090
Steven Seagal movie.
Okay.

829
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.350
<v 10>Don't get on a graph.
You fucking look at me.
I'll blow your fucking head off.</v>

830
00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.570
<v 7>And the whole thing was over and he just,
his family name.</v>

831
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.020
<v 10>Did your pop know what you're doing?</v>

832
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:46.280
Do they suspect he didn't suspect it until much,
much later.

833
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:51.050
Jimmy grew up in the shadow of his father,
big gym,
a giant of a man.

834
00:50:51.051 --> 00:50:55.370
It was a cop,
fireman and hero to his son.
He's my best friend.

835
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.100
He was my backbone and pretty much everything I did

836
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:59.710
<v 7>and they never said it,</v>

837
00:50:59.711 --> 00:51:02.950
but I imagine they probably took his fucking pictures down off of the high

838
00:51:02.951 --> 00:51:06.130
school and all of that type of shit,
you know,
did some Oj Shit,
right?

839
00:51:06.131 --> 00:51:08.860
Take all his trophies and all that fucking shit.
So it's over.
Right.

840
00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.020
So then he's sitting in jail,
um,

841
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.290
and they tried to get him to flip and this is kids,

842
00:51:17.291 --> 00:51:21.550
just some fucking kid from the suburbs,
right?
So I'm thinking,
well,
he's out.

843
00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.900
He must have ratted somebody out so he doesn't rat anybody out.

844
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.980
He's like,
I'm not telling on anybody.
So then they're like,
I will fuck you.

845
00:51:29.981 --> 00:51:33.550
So now we're not going to help us out.
We're going to fucking give you,
you know,

846
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.820
the full extent of the law.
We're going to prosecute you.

847
00:51:36.821 --> 00:51:40.810
So they gave him 10 years,
the guy gets 10 years

848
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.660
<v 10>and in court Bomag showed keen,
no mercy,</v>

849
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:48.300
he was coming at you on all fours.
I wasn't me.
Oh yeah.
I mean he was,

850
00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:52.730
he was a bulldog.
Jimmy was convicted and slapped with a 10 year sentence.

851
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:55.270
<v 7>He's in like a minimum security cause you know,</v>

852
00:51:55.271 --> 00:51:58.300
he didn't really have any violent past or anything.

853
00:51:58.301 --> 00:52:01.030
He was just getting people addicted to drugs.
That's all he was doing.

854
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:08.250
So his dad is devastated and all that shit and he goes to jail.

855
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.310
And uh,
meanwhile this serial killer guys out there killing these girls.

856
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.410
So I'm thinking,
what the fuck went?

857
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.600
And they keep going to commercial mean versus look and he's had to go and how

858
00:52:16.601 --> 00:52:18.760
the fuck are they going to tie this fucking thing together?

859
00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:25.220
<v 10>The baseball kid comes with bad and six balls assembly required Neil from Ohio.</v>

860
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:25.950
Art.

861
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:30.870
<v 7>Long story short,
they ended up catching the serial killer guy.</v>

862
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:32.760
Uh,
I forget how we fucked up,

863
00:52:32.761 --> 00:52:35.870
but they ended up catching him in one of those things where you seem like

864
00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.180
relieved and all of that type of shit.
And uh,

865
00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:43.260
but he had this thing where he wouldn't admit to all of them and if he came at

866
00:52:43.261 --> 00:52:45.210
him,
he would just clam up.
It wouldn't say shit.

867
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:50.230
<v 10>He denied confessing the any killing,
including Jessie's and Trisha's.</v>

868
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:51.543
What's more,

869
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:56.020
he claimed it was all a misunderstanding about disturbing dreams he had.

870
00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:00.080
<v 7>So he ends up going to jail for like either one to two murders for life.</v>

871
00:53:00.081 --> 00:53:01.550
He's never fucking getting out.

872
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:05.420
So meanwhile there's all these parents whose daughters were killed by this guy

873
00:53:05.421 --> 00:53:08.180
and they don't know where they are and all they just wanted as the body,

874
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.320
they want fucking closure.

875
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:12.500
And these parents had just tortured by this fucking thing.
All right,

876
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.980
so they're trying to figure out,
because he won't talk to them,

877
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:19.460
you won't tell him anything.
And he's also in denial and he keeps going like,

878
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:21.530
actually I didn't kill him and blah blah blah,
blah,
blah.

879
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:24.260
And then one day be like,
oh I did and I blacked out.

880
00:53:24.261 --> 00:53:27.780
I don't remember like the was,
he's a fucking creepy goddamn mess.
Right.

881
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.740
So they ended up coming up with this idea that they need a charismatic person to

882
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:39.690
talk to this,
to befriend this serial killer,
gain the guys trust.

883
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:42.390
And maybe he'll tell him where like the bodies are and that type of shit.

884
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.360
So they go to this fucking dude,
Captain America,

885
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.700
you know the football player,

886
00:53:47.701 --> 00:53:51.900
the movie star looking guy who fucked his whole life up cause he got involved in

887
00:53:51.901 --> 00:53:53.220
drugs.
Right.

888
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:58.560
And they approached him to go from as minimum security to go into a maximum

889
00:53:58.561 --> 00:54:02.520
security prison with his murderers,
rapists,
animals,
fucking maniacs.

890
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:07.440
<v 10>Right.
And um,
you know,
to go in there and they said,</v>

891
00:54:07.441 --> 00:54:09.150
if you get,
if you get this information out,

892
00:54:09.151 --> 00:54:12.090
we'll take your sentence and we'll just wipe out.

893
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:14.760
The rest of it will set you free.
He'd already done like three,
four years.

894
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:19.740
And he came up with an outside the box game to get hall,

895
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:24.840
which would risk the life of that charismatic convent they had just put away for

896
00:54:24.841 --> 00:54:27.660
dealing drugs.
Jimmy Kim,

897
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.320
what happens when I've got to deal with all these crazy killers and stuff?

898
00:54:31.321 --> 00:54:33.840
You know what if I get shanked,
what if I get killed?
I mean,

899
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:35.740
am I going to survive this?
So

900
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:40.710
<v 7>meanwhile,
Captain America's Dad had a series of strokes,
you know,</v>

901
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:45.090
and was basically gonna die and he had to go see him.
I mean,

902
00:54:45.091 --> 00:54:48.570
it's like a fucking movie.
So he goes,
all right,
fuck it,
I'll,
I'll do it.

903
00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:53.530
<v 10>We pride through the window to each other and we talked for a while and he</v>

904
00:54:53.531 --> 00:54:55.720
didn't even know about the offer that nobody know about it.

905
00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.900
Jimmy now realize Betty had a one time only opportunity to fix the mess he'd

906
00:55:01.101 --> 00:55:04.870
made for himself and get out while his dad was still alive.

907
00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.220
<v 7>But I want it in writing that you're definitely going to let me go.
So they say,</v>

908
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:12.120
yeah.
So they go out,
right?
Egos.
They go,
here's the deal.

909
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:17.720
We don't want you to approach him for at least six months cause he's very cagey

910
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:20.760
and if she fucking,
you know,
come at the guy the wrong way,

911
00:55:20.761 --> 00:55:24.780
he just fucking walls himself off and that's it.
All right,

912
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:27.990
so this kid comes walking in,
he goes in,
he goes,
fine,
cool.

913
00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.810
And he walks in and he's like,
I don't have six months.
By Dad's going to die.

914
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:36.210
<v 10>All he wanted was to get in and out with Trisha's location and as fast as</v>

915
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:37.040
possible

916
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.530
<v 7>within the first two months,
two,
I'm sorry,</v>

917
00:55:39.531 --> 00:55:44.390
first two hours he goes into the fucking jail
and he fucking,

918
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.840
uh,
on purpose accidentally bumps into the guy.

919
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.670
<v 10>I was waiting with my tray and I look over and there he is 20,</v>

920
00:55:51.671 --> 00:55:54.190
25 feet away from me sitting there all by himself.

921
00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.460
It felt like a magnet was compelling me to come to him.

922
00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.790
And finally I bumped shoulders with him on purpose

923
00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.000
<v 7>and then he immediately apologized.
He goes,
Oh,
I'm sorry about that buddy.</v>

924
00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.130
I didn't see it standing there.
Hey,
he goes,
I'm new here.

925
00:56:06.131 --> 00:56:10.480
Do you know where the library is?
And the guy tells him where the library is.

926
00:56:10.481 --> 00:56:14.380
And he goes,
thanks man.
Uh,
you know,
and he said something to the effect of a,

927
00:56:14.381 --> 00:56:17.290
yeah,
you're a good guy and gives him a little slap on the shoulder.
That's it.

928
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:21.250
It goes to the fucking library.
And they set it up where his fucking,

929
00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.660
his cell was across the hall from the other guy.

930
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:29.160
And he says to him,
he goes,
hey man,
he runs into him getting,
Hey,
wait,

931
00:56:29.161 --> 00:56:31.950
you stay in Blah Blah.
He goes,
oh,
hi.
It's crazy man.
You want him running across?

932
00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.660
And he said,
it's good to be with a good guy like you,
blah,
blah,

933
00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.280
right across from each other.

934
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:41.430
And Ego's a so then fucking the serial killer guy.

935
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.850
One day he goes,
hey,
you want to get lunch with me and my friends?

936
00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.870
And at this point me adversely were fucking laughing our balls off going like

937
00:56:48.871 --> 00:56:53.630
this kind of social shit happens in prison.
Okay,
y'all,
some friends of mine,
uh,

938
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.060
going to have some other murderers and serial killers.
We're going to get some,

939
00:56:57.061 --> 00:57:01.910
uh,
maybe get some,
uh,
you know,
uh,
frapin a fucking rapper.

940
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.090
Something you want to come down,
just kind of hang,

941
00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.050
I'll meet you down in the commissary.

942
00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:09.900
You always think it's all just getting shanked and try not to get raped.
Right?

943
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:14.280
So he goes,
yeah,
cool.
So long story gains,
this guy's fucking confidence.

944
00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.880
And one time he actually goes in and he sees the guy,

945
00:57:16.881 --> 00:57:19.420
he's got a map with all these red dots on it and all that shit.

946
00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:21.320
<v 9>And as I came up from behind him,</v>

947
00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.560
he had all these little different statues lined up,

948
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:29.210
10 15 of them maybe.
And I couldn't tell what they were at first.

949
00:57:29.211 --> 00:57:30.230
And as I got closer,

950
00:57:30.231 --> 00:57:34.460
I had noticed he had a big map laid out and he dove on that map and folded that

951
00:57:34.461 --> 00:57:37.760
thing up really fast and slid it off to the side of the table.
And I go,

952
00:57:37.761 --> 00:57:40.980
what are these things?
Anyway,
he says,
there are these little falcons,

953
00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:42.870
<v 7>he's trying to get to it and blah,
blah blah.</v>

954
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:46.230
So the guy starts opening up any finally ends up telling him this fucking

955
00:57:46.231 --> 00:57:50.970
stories,
um,
of all the women that he killed and all of that shit.

956
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:55.650
And,
uh,
it's sort of kind of mentioned.

957
00:57:55.710 --> 00:58:00.710
He gave him like sort of enough information about where the bodies were and the

958
00:58:01.831 --> 00:58:06.000
captain America guy kind of fucked up because once he got the information he

959
00:58:06.001 --> 00:58:11.001
thought he had enough information to find all the bodies and get himself out of

960
00:58:11.281 --> 00:58:15.390
prison and he just couldn't,
oh wait,
I forgot the best part.
I'm sorry.

961
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:18.690
It's gonna be like a Tarantino movie.
Now we're going to jump backwards.

962
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:22.470
Another way he gained the guy's confidence was one day they was sitting in the

963
00:58:22.471 --> 00:58:24.480
TV room watching TV.

964
00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:30.360
He's sitting next to this guy and this big fucking giant dude just gets up and

965
00:58:30.361 --> 00:58:34.380
turns the channel
without talking to anybody.

966
00:58:34.381 --> 00:58:38.250
And as he turns to channel the serial killer who was unlike a meek little guy

967
00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:43.110
and he just kind of went,
he just sort of said out loud to nobody was like,
Hey,

968
00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:44.310
I was watching that.

969
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.350
<v 9>That's not right.
I was watching that</v>

970
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:51.440
<v 7>like powerlessly really fucking weird psycho thing.</v>

971
00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.480
And the fucking captain America Dude walked up to the big dude and knocked him

972
00:58:56.481 --> 00:58:59.180
out.
Just beat the guy's ass,

973
00:58:59.181 --> 00:59:01.640
hit him with an upper cut fucking forearm shiver,

974
00:59:01.641 --> 00:59:05.780
and just sent this guy flying through some chairs and then they stuck them in

975
00:59:05.781 --> 00:59:08.800
the hall.
That's what happened.
And then when he fucking comes out,
tell me,

976
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:10.990
it doesn't sound like a fuck.
I almost don't even believe it.

977
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:14.500
So that's when he gained the guy's conference.
That's when the dude told him.

978
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.800
And his second,
he tells him this dude,

979
00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:21.590
Captain America couldn't hold it in anymore.
And he goes to do you know what?

980
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:24.670
You're a sick fucking piece of shit,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And flipped out on him.

981
00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:27.550
<v 9>Then you got a little full of yourself in there.
I did that.</v>

982
00:59:27.551 --> 00:59:31.000
I thought it was good for me to unload on him and tell him what I really thought

983
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:33.820
of him and who he really was.
I said,
you know,

984
00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:38.020
so I'm gonna be going home tomorrow there.
And I said,
you're a crazy killer.

985
00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:40.720
And I started calling them everything you can think of.

986
00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:44.440
<v 7>And then the guy,
the seal killed just backed up and he goes,
he goes,</v>

987
00:59:44.441 --> 00:59:46.410
who sent you?
And he goes,
so and so sent you writing.

988
00:59:46.411 --> 00:59:49.840
And he named the prosecutor and then he just fucking disappeared and the map

989
00:59:49.841 --> 00:59:53.350
disappeared too.
So then it's like they didn't get the map.

990
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:57.730
So there was a thing,
we don't know where the fucking bodies still are,
blah,
blah,

991
00:59:57.731 --> 01:00:00.730
blah,
blah,
blah.
But she got him to admit to these fucking murderers.

992
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.910
So we know that the women are at least dead.
The blobby basically in the end,

993
01:00:03.911 --> 01:00:04.790
he did enough for you

994
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.860
<v 9>got out.
Um,</v>

995
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:12.450
<v 7>and the whole time we were watching this fucking thing,
we were just going like,</v>

996
01:00:12.451 --> 01:00:13.860
this is,
this is a fucking movie.

997
01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.930
And I guarantee you when they do the fucking movie,

998
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.000
they don't even need to add any mustard to it.

999
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.680
But I guarantee you when the movie,

1000
01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:25.380
<v 9>he won't flip out in the end,
you know,
or free flips out.
But then he somehow,</v>

1001
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:27.840
and then that'll be the last little leg kick up.
Like,
oh no,

1002
01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:29.310
they didn't find the map and the movie,

1003
01:00:29.311 --> 01:00:32.670
he'll find the map and then the parents will actually get closure.

1004
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:33.504
But in real life

1005
01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:55.323
<v 0>do changed</v>

1006
01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:05.010
<v 11>going on.
It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

1007
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:10.310
uh,
August 30th,
2010.

1008
01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:13.940
I'll look at that.
There's 31 days in August this year.
I didn't realize that.

1009
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.160
I thought,
uh,
all the,

1010
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:19.400
all the rent and everything like that was going to be due on Tuesday,

1011
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.240
but this year I think it's every,
every nine years.

1012
01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:27.800
There's 31 days in August and you can look that up to people.
That's um,
uh,

1013
01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:31.820
you know,
40 days has November,
April,
September.

1014
01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:35.450
And remember all the rest got 28,
dude,

1015
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:40.190
so I don't know what you're talking about.
Isn't that how it goes?
Um,

1016
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:44.030
anyways,
huck is 29th.
I'm recording this.

1017
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.650
Tomorrow is August 30th.
And you're listening to it right now on August 30th.

1018
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:54.310
All right.
What happened to the summer?
Where did it go?
It's,
it's over,

1019
01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:58.030
man.
I hope you enjoyed it.
Didn't I tell you guys doing joint back in May?

1020
01:01:58.031 --> 01:02:02.470
Did you listen to me?
You didn't,
did you?
You thought,
ah,
we got plenty of tie.

1021
01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:06.620
He's plenty of fucking time.
Then what happened?
Next thing,
you know,

1022
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:10.200
it's August 29th,
you know,
you're looking down at your pace,

1023
01:02:10.201 --> 01:02:13.370
the legs go and Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

1024
01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:16.610
your farmer's Tan from and the fucking long he didn't do shit.

1025
01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.300
I warned you.
I told you in May it was going to fly by.
And what'd you do?

1026
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:27.300
Did you spend one night roasting marshmallows as they say in Boston?

1027
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.720
Um,
I'm doing this on the 29th,

1028
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:35.460
so it will be ready early on the 30th and a also because,
uh,

1029
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:39.240
this week,
as of right now,
when you're listening to this,
I will be onset.

1030
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:42.810
Isn't that exciting?
This whole week I'm shooting my pilot,
uh,

1031
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:47.820
for comedy central Monday,
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday.
And uh,

1032
01:02:47.821 --> 01:02:51.270
unless we make a horrific piece of shit,
um,
according to the deal,

1033
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:55.110
it's definitely going to air.
So a,
I better make sure that,
uh,

1034
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.190
my acting game is where it needs to be.
Um,

1035
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.630
because we start shooting tomorrow.

1036
01:03:00.631 --> 01:03:04.800
I'm actually really excited about this show and as always,
I don't name names,

1037
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:09.540
so,
uh,
you know,
you don't even need to know names because of,

1038
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:11.730
it's going to be worth anything.
You're going to know who the fuck's in it,

1039
01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:16.680
but I think it's going to be great and I'm really excited about it and maybe

1040
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:21.000
this will be the one that actually gets me to be on TV.

1041
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.193
Right?

1042
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.550
Then all of a sudden it goes to a second season and then you notice I'm getting

1043
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:28.770
a little bloated.
You know,

1044
01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:32.520
I come to your town to do stand up and I'm just not as sharp as I used to be

1045
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:33.450
when I was hungry,

1046
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:36.210
when I wanted to have a show and all of a sudden you guys like,

1047
01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:40.140
you know he's not as fun as these used to be.
I like the old Bill Burr,

1048
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.420
the pre t v show bill burr.

1049
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:46.210
Why is he wearing a bathrobe and slippers on stage?

1050
01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:50.430
Is he working out of character for his new hit show or did he just roll out of

1051
01:03:50.431 --> 01:03:52.280
fucking bed to come down here,

1052
01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:55.080
drink a little scotch and collect his fucking check?

1053
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.900
That's exactly what I'm going to be doing.
Okay.

1054
01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.900
People when I get on television,
I,

1055
01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:03.240
if I get my own with this TV show goes,

1056
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:07.410
my standup is going to go do fucking south.

1057
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.130
I'm telling you right now,
I never liked stand up.

1058
01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:14.370
It was all just a tool to get me,

1059
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:20.520
I'm fucking with you.
I'm Archie already paranoid about that.

1060
01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.200
I'm already sitting there and I'm thinking in my head,
typical me,

1061
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.500
typical east coast negative guy,

1062
01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:32.460
just looking for the next shoe to drop rather than being like,
oh fuck,

1063
01:04:32.461 --> 01:04:36.360
I can be on a hit TV show and uh,
you know,

1064
01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:39.480
my life could be awesome.
I'm already thinking,
Oh fuck.

1065
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:40.890
What's going to happen to my stand up?

1066
01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:46.130
How can I work in guest spots during the week so I can stay so I can stay sharp?

1067
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:51.960
You know,
I don't trust these fuckers.
Yeah,
it's a hit.
Oh,

1068
01:04:51.961 --> 01:04:54.810
is it?
Yeah.
I,
I'm,
I'm believing you.

1069
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:59.760
You guys are fucking pulled that Charlie Brown pull the football fucking thing.

1070
01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:03.330
I'll Lucy,
whatever that con's name is from the paint.
It's gang,

1071
01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.870
um,
too many times,
so I'm not buying it.

1072
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.610
I won't buy it until it goes into syndication.
What's your show about?

1073
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.930
What is it?
Is it,
is it a comedy?
Is it a drama?

1074
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:17.680
It's on comedy central.

1075
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:22.930
Just you and anybody who has a Nielsen box.
Whenever the fuck it comes out,

1076
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:23.764
please sit there.

1077
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.490
Find the oldest person on your block cause God knows they have it.

1078
01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:32.491
Whoever is the oldest person on your block or whoever's the most into Jesus,

1079
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:33.850
they,
oh gee,

1080
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.410
they're going to be the ones who have the Nielsen box.

1081
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.820
Those are the people that determine,
I guess,
you know why?

1082
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:47.260
Cause they actually have time to write letters.
Um,

1083
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.120
anyways,
so that's the deal.

1084
01:05:49.121 --> 01:05:52.630
I'm shooting a show this week that is going to air on comedy central at some

1085
01:05:52.631 --> 01:05:56.740
point.
And uh,
speaking of something airing on comedy central,

1086
01:05:56.741 --> 01:05:57.670
just to let you know,

1087
01:05:57.671 --> 01:06:02.671
my standup special let it go is finally airing September 18th on comedy central

1088
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.470
and I believe it's going to be uncut.

1089
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.350
Hopefully it'll show up late at night when my crowd is just stumbling in from

1090
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:15.730
whatever fucking for the lab from the last four hours of mistakes that they made

1091
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.100
on of night of drinking.
Okay.

1092
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.640
And after you have it out with your significant other and she doesn't let you

1093
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:23.950
sleep in the room or whatever,

1094
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:28.720
he doesn't let you whatever sloppy mess you are,
just go,

1095
01:06:28.721 --> 01:06:28.991
you know,

1096
01:06:28.991 --> 01:06:32.380
sit down and you're fucking lazy boy and watch my special September 18th.

1097
01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:33.640
All right,
there we go.

1098
01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.930
I got all the hype out of the way and um,

1099
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:40.660
I had a bunch of shit to talk about this weekend.
Um,

1100
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:46.780
I know the NFL season starts on Thursday night because the NFL is basically,

1101
01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:51.490
I think slowly trying to be seven days a week,
which I am against.

1102
01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.690
You know,
I always thought it was really unique how it just,

1103
01:06:55.691 --> 01:07:00.691
it all happened on fucking Sunday and everybody was just fucking getting geared

1104
01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:00.941
up.

1105
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:05.941
It's the anticipation leave them wanting more classic show business theory and

1106
01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:10.570
the NFL had it like nobody else.
And now the talk,
ah,
fuck,

1107
01:07:10.571 --> 01:07:15.220
let's add more games.
18 weeks schedule 18 games.
Right.

1108
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.180
Is that what they were trying to do?

1109
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:19.750
They already got the bye week so they've got an extra fucking week in there,

1110
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:21.910
right.
For more advertising.

1111
01:07:21.911 --> 01:07:24.110
Now they're trying to add two more days now the shifts,

1112
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:29.020
you got kicking it off on a fucking Thursday.
They're playing in Europe.

1113
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:30.401
You know,

1114
01:07:30.401 --> 01:07:34.670
I really sound like a crabby old man woe your story prior on Shawnda and

1115
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:39.070
everybody gathered around a TV.
Um,
I liked it better that way.

1116
01:07:39.071 --> 01:07:42.320
What the fuck is wrong with Sunday?
You know,
you go to church,

1117
01:07:42.321 --> 01:07:44.890
Yo g used and then you fucking,
you sit down,

1118
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:49.390
you get drunk and you watch the football games.
Nobody gets hurt.
Show up Monday,

1119
01:07:49.391 --> 01:07:54.220
all hung over going,
dude,
what the fuck did they run it for?
Their Ah,

1120
01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:57.190
they should have passed it.
That's what I would've done.

1121
01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:01.810
That's what I would've done seeing as now that I know that,

1122
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.470
that they shouldn't have fucking run it in that moment.
So anyways,

1123
01:08:05.471 --> 01:08:10.180
I was trying to figure out what the schedules for and um,
I ended up going on to,

1124
01:08:10.181 --> 01:08:11.680
uh,
see what the Patriots have.

1125
01:08:11.681 --> 01:08:15.130
We got the Bengals the first week with Batman and Robin,

1126
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:21.320
I'm really gay anyways.
Uh,

1127
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:25.400
so I was checking out the schedule and one of the stories,

1128
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:28.910
if you can fucking believe this,
the story is Tom Brady,

1129
01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:34.210
how he can swing the Peyton manning debate in 2010 and this is what it says,

1130
01:08:35.061 --> 01:08:35.930
the Tom Brady,

1131
01:08:35.931 --> 01:08:40.700
Peyton manning debate has raged for the past decade and will probably continue

1132
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:45.620
to do so until the to retire every time one seems to make their case,

1133
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.400
the other offers a rebuttal the next year.
All right.

1134
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:53.730
All of that's fair enough.
I'll even give you that.
But this is what they say,
man.

1135
01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:58.740
He made his case in 2009 by carrying his team to a Superbowl birth with an MVP

1136
01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:03.350
season.
That's what they said.

1137
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:09.220
Completely ignoring the fact that the guy had the game in his fingertips.

1138
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:14.980
Just like Tom Brady has four fucking super and Tom Brady has delivered four

1139
01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:18.830
fucking times.
Giant fans shut the fuck up.

1140
01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:21.470
The last time he got the ball,
he drove.

1141
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:23.520
Actually he got the ball with like eight seconds left.

1142
01:09:23.521 --> 01:09:26.900
You're going to be cuts and call them that,
you know,
and count them on that one.

1143
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:30.890
But even when we lost to the giants,
when he had time to drive down the field,

1144
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:33.500
that's exactly what the fuck he did for the go ahead.

1145
01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:36.020
Score for the unprecedented for time,

1146
01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.100
fourth time and the biggest fucking game in professional football.

1147
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.030
He's done it for fucking times.
He's got three rings.

1148
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:49.180
Peyton manning has one fucking ring and he had the Superbowl on his fucking

1149
01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:52.600
fingertips.
And not only does he not drive them for four or five,

1150
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:54.170
and I know I'm going through this again,

1151
01:09:54.230 --> 01:09:57.170
but I have to because people keep forgetting this shit he had,

1152
01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.820
he had the game winning drive right there.
The Go,
you hit,
go ahead.
Peyton.

1153
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.460
Drive down the fucking field.
Not only does he not score that touchdown,

1154
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:06.350
not only do they don't even not get a field goal,

1155
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.340
he throws a pick fucking six to lose the game for his fucking team.

1156
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.550
And somehow I want to know where the debate is.

1157
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:18.020
Where is the debate?
Indianapolis Colts fans,

1158
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.220
which would you rather have as a quarterback?

1159
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.400
A guy who acts absolutely annihilates the competition in the regular season.

1160
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:30.290
Okay.

1161
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:35.290
And can only get you one championship or would you rather have the other guy who

1162
01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:39.260
wins three out of four fucking super bowls?
What would you rather have?

1163
01:10:39.261 --> 01:10:43.130
You won three rings.
You want one?
The debate is fucking over.

1164
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:47.630
There is no debate
as far as I'm concerned.

1165
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:51.710
Peyton manning is still chasing old date rape there in fucking Pittsburgh

1166
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.580
because as much as you wouldn't want that son of a bitch around your daughter,

1167
01:10:55.581 --> 01:10:59.120
God damn it.
You got to want them under center.
All right.

1168
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:08.150
This is bullshit that just that they just put this out here to get people all

1169
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:08.691
pissed off.

1170
01:11:08.691 --> 01:11:12.800
Just like that mosque at Ground Zero that had me pissed for 48 fucking hours

1171
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.630
before I found out.
It's not at ground zero.

1172
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.920
It's fucking two three blocks up the street and it's not a mosque.

1173
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:24.570
It's like a fucking wreck room.
All right.
I don't give a fuck.

1174
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:28.110
You want to go in there and play Ping Pong?
It talk about Muhammad.

1175
01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:31.290
I don't give a shit,
but what did they save?
Right?
It's a mosque.

1176
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:36.030
It's at ground zero.
They're building a bronze statue too,

1177
01:11:36.031 --> 01:11:37.140
is some of bin Laden.

1178
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.860
You should've seen me frothing at the mouth like a dog that had gone.

1179
01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:45.480
Matt actually got into a fucking debate about it with somebody.
You know,

1180
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.350
when out when I,
when I thought it was an actual mosque,

1181
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:51.420
when I thought it was being built at ground zero,

1182
01:11:51.421 --> 01:11:55.410
like I was told they're building a mosque at ground zero,

1183
01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.530
you know,
so I was like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1184
01:11:58.530 --> 01:12:01.170
Not only did they not rebuild the towers,

1185
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:05.620
not only their architects still acting like they give a fuck when the reality is

1186
01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:09.180
that they want the contract so they can put their fucking name on the building.

1187
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.150
Not only is that bull bullshit been going on for what,

1188
01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:14.790
nine fucking years now they're going to put a mohs down there.

1189
01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:17.390
I was literally beside myself and uh,

1190
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.360
I was getting into tons of arguments out here in Hollywood about it during the

1191
01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:25.860
48 hours when I actually thought they were building a mosque at ground zero.
Um,

1192
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:30.900
and they fucking,
you know,
these Douche bags out here,

1193
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:35.250
they will use to release each.
You thinking like,
I don't realize that.

1194
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.270
Like I realize that it was not the religion.

1195
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:43.050
I realized that Shit,
but you know,
you know,
how about,

1196
01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:47.640
how about just having a little bit of tact,
you know,
you know what I mean?

1197
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.510
That's all I'm saying.
That's all I'm saying.

1198
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.900
I know it's not the fucking religion.
Okay.
But you know,
look,
look at my religion.

1199
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:55.920
Look at the Jesus freaks.

1200
01:12:55.921 --> 01:12:59.760
Go out there and kill fucking abortion doctors now with 18 of them flew a

1201
01:12:59.761 --> 01:13:02.940
fucking a,
you know,
a Cessna into an abortion clinic.

1202
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.220
Fucking blew the God damn place up.

1203
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:08.580
And then the next day they wanted to put a big brunch statue of Jesus across the

1204
01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:10.350
street and people,

1205
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.920
the sons and daughters of the abortion doctors had a fucking problem with that.

1206
01:13:13.921 --> 01:13:17.820
I will be like,
yeah,
you know,
do we,
do we really have to put it there?
I mean,

1207
01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:20.580
it's not us,
right?
We didn't do it.
It's not the whole fucking religion,

1208
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:24.870
but rarely all the fucking places you could put a big bronze statues of fucking

1209
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:28.620
hey suits there.
Oh Gee.
Ages,
right?
We can't just fucking,
you know,

1210
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:32.760
maybe go like quarter mile,
half mile up the fucking street.
That's all.

1211
01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:36.210
That's all I'm saying.
Right?
That was my fucking argument.

1212
01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.530
And we were going back and forth.

1213
01:13:37.531 --> 01:13:40.650
Then I realized that's not even a Goddamn mosque.
It's not at ground zero.
Okay.

1214
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.210
Free blocks up the street.
The building like a lemonade stand assumption.

1215
01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.950
And as always,
I didn't really quite fucking read up on that part of it,
but um,

1216
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.300
yeah,
so whatever.
So that's the same thing with this Tom Brady,

1217
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:59.310
Peyton manning debate.
There is no fucking debate.
This is ESPN guys,

1218
01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:03.100
all these sports guys,
they have this nothing left to fucking debate.
So they did,

1219
01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.410
they learned that with that Yankees,

1220
01:14:04.411 --> 01:14:07.080
red sox keep pitting them against each other.

1221
01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:10.890
Even when everybody's kind of over it.
You know,

1222
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:14.260
it's like once the curse of the babe was broken,
it's fucking over.

1223
01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:17.260
Who gives a fuck?
Yes,
we're going to play each other.
Yes,

1224
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:20.320
the Yankees will win it again.
Oh look,
the red sox won it again too.

1225
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.620
It's over and they keep trying to sell it to you.

1226
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:28.330
What are the greatest rivalries?
No one gives a fuck.
And by no one,

1227
01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:29.920
I mean I don't give a fuck anymore.

1228
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:34.210
Therefore nobody gives a fuck in this Tom Brady,
Peyton manning debate,

1229
01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:37.120
there is no fucking debate.

1230
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.610
Peyton manning cannot care.
He can't hold fucking Tom Brady's jockstrap.

1231
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:46.030
He can't
look.

1232
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:50.920
Anybody can kick the shit out of people during the fucking regular season,

1233
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:55.330
but when it counts,
when it counts,
what do you do?

1234
01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.090
What do you do these stand out like a man.

1235
01:14:58.091 --> 01:15:02.140
I'll fucking relax like Joe Montana and drive your team down the fucking field

1236
01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:04.750
or do you get that little bitchy tone in your fucking voice?

1237
01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:09.310
Okay guys is how it's going to be on too and you get under center.
Well,

1238
01:15:09.311 --> 01:15:12.160
whatever you do gotta beat Marsha,

1239
01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.320
got to get close to than a quarter of an inch from.
But that one,

1240
01:15:14.321 --> 01:15:18.910
Greg Brady striving that fucking caprice classic or whatever the fuck they had

1241
01:15:18.911 --> 01:15:23.560
whipping it around the parking lot.
Making fun of how broads can't drive.

1242
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:28.561
One of my favorite fucking episodes of the Brady by my two favorite episodes was

1243
01:15:28.781 --> 01:15:33.781
the first half of that Brady Bunch episode when Greg Brady was bringing the

1244
01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:36.410
fucking hammer down and it was going,

1245
01:15:36.411 --> 01:15:39.490
let me tell you three fucking stepsister bitches,
something.

1246
01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:41.320
None of you broads know how to drive.

1247
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.930
And that includes your mother who I'm banging by the way,

1248
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:48.040
who I'm banging by the way.
All right.

1249
01:15:48.041 --> 01:15:52.120
With their weird ass haircut,
whatever the fuck you know.

1250
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:56.770
Did anybody ever have that fucking haircut?
Uh,
other than her.
I mean,

1251
01:15:56.771 --> 01:15:59.410
that is like,
I dunno what it was.

1252
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:04.950
She took like Mo from the three stooges haircut and then she put a fucking sort

1253
01:16:05.081 --> 01:16:09.130
of mullet that she did a little flipped to on the back.
Anyways,

1254
01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:11.440
let's get back to you brands.
You don't know how to fucking drive.

1255
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:13.810
That goes for you with the fucking speech impediment.

1256
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.280
You don't know how to fucking drive Jan with you.

1257
01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:20.590
Awful fucking Hasidic Jew fucking curls.
I don't know what you're trying to do.

1258
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:24.070
You know,
and,
and,
and Marcia who,

1259
01:16:24.071 --> 01:16:27.850
I don't know why I'm not banging you some reasons I skipped over you and started

1260
01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:31.750
banging your mother.
Right?
None of you bitches can fucking drive.

1261
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.320
And I'm watching this episode going to see Greg is the shit.

1262
01:16:35.321 --> 01:16:39.940
Greg Berry Fuck Fonzie.
You know,
with his stupid fucking,
you know,

1263
01:16:39.941 --> 01:16:44.410
spinning around and punching a jukebox so it plays Shaboom Shaboom I don't give

1264
01:16:44.411 --> 01:16:48.100
a fuck about that.
I liked Greg Brady,
you know,

1265
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:52.300
for as much as Fonzie was talking shit.
He was always nice to the ladies and he,

1266
01:16:52.301 --> 01:16:56.440
that's,
that's seventh grade game with the woman Greg Brady.
That's,

1267
01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:59.800
that's how Greg ended up fucking them mom,
because he didn't give a shit.

1268
01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.190
He didn't give a fuck
Greg.
Fuck you Carol.
You're not my mother.

1269
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:08.320
You know how to drive either.
Oh my God.

1270
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:13.470
Took him in that fucking groovy attic day heads started blowing up twice.

1271
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:15.350
Hair got all curly.

1272
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:21.050
So anyways,
that episode,

1273
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:24.530
he's telling these fucking broads that they don't know how to drive.

1274
01:17:24.531 --> 01:17:27.080
And then in the end of course,
cause they always have to cater to women.

1275
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:32.840
These nerdy fucking writers,
you know,
and then the end they fucking,
you know,

1276
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:37.990
Marsha goes around this stupid fucking track and they had a cone with a little

1277
01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:40.550
egg on it.
You guys are seeing this and she fucking,
you know,

1278
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.720
I forget whatever Marsha chokes in the beginning and then in the end just to

1279
01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:45.760
fucking even it out.

1280
01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:48.800
So everybody's happy and they could sell tide during the commercials.

1281
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:52.330
They have Greg fuckup and knock the edge off.
That's,

1282
01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.720
that's what I was trying to get to.

1283
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:57.110
Wasn't that what I was trying to get to without one on so fucking long.

1284
01:17:57.111 --> 01:17:59.660
I can't even remember.
All I'm saying is

1285
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:04.670
that the guy you want,
you don't,

1286
01:18:04.671 --> 01:18:08.030
it doesn't fucking matter how many yards you throw

1287
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.180
in the regular season.
It doesn't fucking matter unless you're,

1288
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:17.060
you got them on your fantasy fucking team,
whatever that means.

1289
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:21.620
Evidently that makes you sit up a little bit straighter in your Ikea Office

1290
01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:25.400
chair on Monday.
I don't know what the fuck it means,
but at the end of the day,

1291
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:30.140
how you judge a quarterback is in those fucking moments.
Okay.
All right.

1292
01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:33.050
And I understand the Barry Sanders out there played on the lines.

1293
01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:35.570
It's a horrific franchise.
I can't judge him like that.

1294
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:37.640
He never had the opportunity,
so I dumped.

1295
01:18:37.641 --> 01:18:41.540
But when I see a guy like Peyton manning who has had the opportunities and he

1296
01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:44.840
has not delivered,
for them to sit there and try to act like this,

1297
01:18:44.841 --> 01:18:47.810
fucking debate is still going on.
It isn't.

1298
01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:52.850
There is no Peyton Manning,
Tom Brady debate Peyton.
Manny has to redeem.

1299
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.460
He has to redeem himself.

1300
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:58.970
You don't think the players on his team of fucking questioning him.

1301
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.390
This is the guy,
this is the guy leading us to battle.

1302
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.190
Who's great during bootcamp,

1303
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:09.950
who's great during the war games we play during fucking regular season,

1304
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:14.870
but when it really comes down to live ammunition and the fucking playoffs,

1305
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:19.990
this fucking guy's curling up in a Fox hole blaming the fucking radar guy.

1306
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:24.740
We had communication issues.
Fuck you.

1307
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.340
There is no debate as far as I'm concerned.
You guys can chime in.

1308
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.920
You guys can chime in.
Go ahead.
Indianapolis.
Huh?
With the ISTEP team,

1309
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:38.060
they're the fucking Baltimore Colts,
by the way.

1310
01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:43.250
That would been great if it and started,
I said the Baltimore Coats.
Um.

1311
01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:46.550
Anyways.
All right.
I enjoyed that.
I'm sure a lot of other people didn't.

1312
01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.260
A lot of people probably turn that off going.

1313
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:50.570
I'm so sick of him talking about Peyton manning.
Well,

1314
01:19:50.571 --> 01:19:54.510
I'm going to react to everything that they write on the news and I guarantee

1315
01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:58.280
you're going to watch Peyton manning again this fucking year.
Just light it up.

1316
01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.050
Light it up.
Absolutely.
Five,

1317
01:20:03.051 --> 01:20:06.860
6,000 fucking yards.
Right?

1318
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:09.210
And all he's got is that little fucking,
you know,

1319
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.600
she's got one little Superbowl ring,
you know,
like,

1320
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.840
like that fucking professional gambler who one time took the big pot and went

1321
01:20:17.671 --> 01:20:20.340
down to the gift shop.
Got himself something fucking shiny.

1322
01:20:21.570 --> 01:20:24.990
You know what about the other nine digits?
They got nothing sitting in naked,

1323
01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:32.400
losing every fucking night.
Coming home to a sparsely furnished apartment.

1324
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:35.670
You know,
don't you have a flat screen TV anymore?
He still got that big fucking,

1325
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:38.490
you know,
zenith color TV

1326
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.580
that's been around since before the world series of poker.
That's,
that's,

1327
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:48.840
that's where Peyton manning is right now.
All right.

1328
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:53.940
Okay.
I think I fucking pretty much poured salt in the field.

1329
01:20:53.941 --> 01:20:55.920
Burned down the village.
All right,
that's over.
Okay.

1330
01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:57.990
For those of you had to sit there and endure that,

1331
01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:59.550
let's give you some pleasurable viewing.

1332
01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:01.830
Why don't you guys do yourself a favor and go over to the [inaudible]

1333
01:21:01.831 --> 01:21:05.970
podcast.com where you can watch all of these funny youtube videos.

1334
01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:11.310
Um,
here are the youtube videos for the week.
Everyone.
Um,

1335
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:16.470
first one,
number one search.
This one crazy guy sings karaoke.

1336
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:20.220
Um,
this is a fucking great one.

1337
01:21:20.221 --> 01:21:24.750
I don't know if you guys want to write a psychological breakdown to this guy.

1338
01:21:24.751 --> 01:21:29.751
I would really appreciate it cause I was trying to figure out this guy's energy

1339
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:31.541
if,
if,

1340
01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:36.541
if it's like he so fucking amped up cause he's always wanted to perform that

1341
01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:42.810
it's somehow manifested itself in this spastic fucking look on his face.

1342
01:21:44.230 --> 01:21:45.900
Tell you right now he's an Asian guy.

1343
01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.960
And the second I saw the STA fucking look on his face that he makes right before

1344
01:21:52.021 --> 01:21:54.450
he starts singing and when he sings the chorus,

1345
01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:58.590
it really reminded me a killer Khan and he wrestling fans out there.

1346
01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.100
Do you remember how killer Khan used to when he used to come on the mic,

1347
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.220
they acted like he couldn't speak fucking English for God knows.

1348
01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:10.110
He probably taught at Princeton during the fucking week.
He would just sit there,

1349
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:13.850
no video guys say McCall

1350
01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:18.930
and having this crazy fucking look at his face and then Freddie Blassie are the

1351
01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:19.800
fucking manage them.

1352
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:24.390
The grand wizard or wrestling would step in acting like they knew how to

1353
01:22:24.391 --> 01:22:25.440
translate his shit.

1354
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.460
That's who I was thinking of when you watch this guy or he really went through a

1355
01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:32.460
breakup cause he's singing a breakup song and he's mad at some bitch.

1356
01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:36.540
I'd have no,
no idea,
but it's a crazy guy.
Sings Karaoke.

1357
01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:39.750
Please check that out.
A youtube video number two,

1358
01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:45.240
Hay bailing fun.
Now if you sit in there right now writing down,

1359
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:48.300
all of these are trying to remember them.
Just go to the [inaudible],
podcast.com.

1360
01:22:48.301 --> 01:22:52.490
We're going to have them all lined up for your nice and fucking easy.
Uh,

1361
01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:57.030
here's another one.
Pulled dance ruins wedding.
This one was so fucked up.

1362
01:22:57.031 --> 01:23:01.350
I thought it was fake,
but evidently not a,
here's another one.

1363
01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:04.260
Prank phone call,
a calling in sick to Walmart.

1364
01:23:05.730 --> 01:23:10.480
And uh,
the last one.
This is one for after you've gone to lunch.

1365
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:13.930
Look up fat wrapper.
Uh,

1366
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.780
this one.
Yeah,
this one.

1367
01:23:16.781 --> 01:23:21.220
You'll have your jaw on your desk looking at this one.
Um,
anyway,

1368
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:21.911
so let's go back to,

1369
01:23:21.911 --> 01:23:25.360
this is why I always wait to the youtube videos in the end because I just

1370
01:23:25.361 --> 01:23:27.760
stopped riffing and I just sorta just,
you know,

1371
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:32.340
and then go check this and then I go into fucking robot mode.
Um,

1372
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:35.470
anyways,
let's,
let's plow ahead here.
Let's get me going again.

1373
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:38.440
Let's get the funny going again on this podcast.
I'm,
oh,

1374
01:23:38.441 --> 01:23:42.490
I know I always trash women on this,
on this podcast and um,

1375
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:47.770
you know,
so I'm always telling them the broads over there to fucking,
you know,

1376
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:50.080
write some shit here,
talk some shit back.

1377
01:23:50.081 --> 01:23:54.310
So we can be nice so we can be fair and balanced.
Like all those,
uh,

1378
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:56.440
those,
those are new shows,

1379
01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.190
those news programs that they have that gave you screaming about mosques.

1380
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:06.280
Do you know,
they're making a bakery where they,

1381
01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.200
where they have the fucking biggest loser.
Um,
anyway.

1382
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:15.760
All right.
Uh,
the empire strikes back is the name of this one.
Um,
this is,

1383
01:24:15.761 --> 01:24:18.910
this is women.
This is this one,
a female listener.

1384
01:24:18.911 --> 01:24:23.560
I have who just really just in a,

1385
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:26.290
just an absolutely beautiful way.
Just dissects guys here.

1386
01:24:26.291 --> 01:24:27.910
So we're going to read this here.
A bill.

1387
01:24:27.911 --> 01:24:32.410
I've been listening to your podcast every week for a while now.
Um,
I like,

1388
01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:37.411
he start off giving me actually a really concise form of time and then you get

1389
01:24:37.511 --> 01:24:40.870
real vague nebulous to your podcast every week for a while.
Now,

1390
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:45.640
every week since 2009,
I mean for a while,

1391
01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:52.000
I will see you at five minutes past some hour today.
Okay.

1392
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:56.050
So be there.
I've noticed you rag on females,
but I haven't been offended.

1393
01:24:56.051 --> 01:24:59.440
It's funny and I know it's all in good fun.
Hey,
is a cool girl.
All right.

1394
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:02.560
I heard the emails of the guys who wrote in trashing women.

1395
01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:06.820
So I am answering the call to write in and trash guys.
God bless you.

1396
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:09.730
Uh,
let me give you a little context about who I am.

1397
01:25:09.731 --> 01:25:13.330
I'm an industrial seamstresses seamstress.
Can't even say it.

1398
01:25:13.331 --> 01:25:17.230
I am an industrial seamstress.
Does that job still exist in this country?

1399
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:23.020
That's great.
Um,
who gets to listen to podcasts?
Podcasts while I work?

1400
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:28.330
I'm 25 and had been married to my husband for six years together for eight.

1401
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:33.730
Okay,
let's try to dissect this woman.
All right.
So she met her husband at 17,

1402
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:38.590
got married at 19,
and she's an industrial seamstress.

1403
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:41.080
You guys want to guess what state she's in?

1404
01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.380
Um,

1405
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:49.810
do you work at the last factory that hasn't been turned into a Condo in Ohio?

1406
01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.610
This is,
this is like a character on little house on the prairie.

1407
01:25:58.390 --> 01:26:03.130
Does your husband have polio?
Um,
anyways,
he is also a fan of you,

1408
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:05.390
your comedy.
Uh,
we have no kids,

1409
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:09.590
but we do have a three year old male am staff.
I don't know what that is.

1410
01:26:09.591 --> 01:26:10.840
Terrier and,

1411
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:14.840
and hopefully we'll have a picture of that on the MM podcast am staff,
a m s t,

1412
01:26:14.841 --> 01:26:19.400
a f f terrier and a nine month old Bluenose American pit bull.

1413
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:20.773
God bless you.

1414
01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.970
My mother raised me on her own and I am the youngest of four kids because I grew

1415
01:26:25.971 --> 01:26:30.560
up without a father in my life.
I am sure that a huge part of my dislike,

1416
01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.630
that's a huge part of my disliking of men.

1417
01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:37.190
Is there anything better than someone who could just address the fact that they

1418
01:26:37.191 --> 01:26:41.210
fucking hate something and actually put a little bit of a little bit of it on

1419
01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:44.690
themselves?
I hope I've done that.
Why do I hate women?

1420
01:26:45.970 --> 01:26:50.900
Uh,
I think it's because I'm a control freak.
I think that's what it is.
And um,

1421
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:54.170
I don't like people running my life or attempting to run my life.

1422
01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:58.640
I don't like people butting into my life.
And that's how I view women.

1423
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:01.310
And it's how I view the marital laws,

1424
01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:03.440
which I understand were put together by men.

1425
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.300
But I think that it was put together by the Illuminati to keep people like

1426
01:27:08.301 --> 01:27:12.050
myself regular guys.
Salt of the earth guys,
you know,

1427
01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:16.010
oh fucking just chip off the old block kind of guys.

1428
01:27:16.011 --> 01:27:20.030
You know the kind of guys you could pal around it say,
Geez wit Gee Whiz with,

1429
01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:20.953
you know,

1430
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:25.250
they prevent us from becoming rich by,

1431
01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.380
let me look at tiger woods.

1432
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:31.280
They cut that man and half

1433
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:37.810
of the Jina came in like a fucking radial arm saw that flew off.

1434
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:38.990
It's fucking hinges

1435
01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:44.840
and just slice that fucking once in a lifetime talent.

1436
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:50.450
Right.
And fucking hap because why?
Why?
Cause he,

1437
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:55.570
cause he blew out his knee because he rested on his laurels now because he got

1438
01:27:56.631 --> 01:28:00.710
legally bound to something that had a vagina.

1439
01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.370
That right there and as you can see,
you know what it really is?

1440
01:28:04.371 --> 01:28:07.890
Is I always look at worst case scenario shit.
Like look at me.
I'm,

1441
01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:12.080
I'm taping a show that could go on to become a hit show.
And what do I do first?

1442
01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:16.340
I immediately worry that my standup is going to suffer rather than being like,

1443
01:28:16.341 --> 01:28:20.120
hey,
this could be awesome.
All right.
Why don't,
why don't you just submit bill,

1444
01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:23.960
you're a fucking psycho and you're a paranoid maniac and you really don't know

1445
01:28:23.961 --> 01:28:26.510
what the fuck you're talking about.
All right.
Guilty as charged.

1446
01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.310
Guilty as charged.
Uh,
but I do know a lot about Greg Brady.

1447
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.860
You got to give me that.
All right,
so here we go.

1448
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.660
Please let me share with you the reasons why some men suck.
Look at this.

1449
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.530
She even said some men and what have you got married so long,
so young.

1450
01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:46.280
This girl is a catch here.
All right,
number one.
She says,

1451
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:51.170
I don't like diesel guys.
You know the guys who drive,
they're extremely lifted,

1452
01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:55.520
tricked out diesel trucks and think that they are so fast.

1453
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:57.530
I don't know what that means.
So cool.

1454
01:28:57.531 --> 01:29:01.160
We mean they are always trying to get me to race them in my evo.

1455
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:06.300
I don't know what that is either.
And what I don't,
uh,

1456
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.740
because they're gay.

1457
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:12.720
They blow black smoke out out their exhaust and peel away.

1458
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.300
Do you worry?
Do you live in Texas?

1459
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:20.490
That just sounded like the beginning of like urban cowboy.
Anyway,

1460
01:29:20.491 --> 01:29:25.470
something about their huge truck makes them think they have a huge dick.
Ah,

1461
01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:28.380
I gotta go.
I gotta go with you on that one.
Yes.
I don't like those guys.

1462
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:32.340
I don't like people who feel like because of the car that they have,
you know,

1463
01:29:32.341 --> 01:29:34.350
especially myself,
because I drive a hybrid.

1464
01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:38.970
I always get people giving me shit and then they start talking about their car.

1465
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.320
Like they fucking invented it.
Like they built it.
It's like,
no,
no,
no.
I'm sorry.

1466
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:47.280
I'm sorry.
Somebody,
some other man had to build that for you.

1467
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:50.140
Do you understand that sweetheart?
So why don't you come on,

1468
01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:53.400
climb behind you a little shiny toy that you don't even understand how it

1469
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:56.430
fucking works.
All right,
you [inaudible] all right.

1470
01:29:56.431 --> 01:30:00.510
Can I kind of plow ahead here and actually stay with,
uh,
with what?

1471
01:30:00.511 --> 01:30:04.050
With rather than interjecting my thoughts,
let's,

1472
01:30:04.051 --> 01:30:06.480
let's let the females talk here.
A number two,

1473
01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.630
my mother always taught me that it is rude to stare.

1474
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:15.060
I guess 50% of men either weren't taught that or they don't care.

1475
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:19.650
It is super fucking annoying when men stare.
I totally understand.

1476
01:30:19.651 --> 01:30:23.670
Seeing an attractive person and,
and them getting your attention,

1477
01:30:23.671 --> 01:30:27.900
but it should end there.
There are too many guys who just keep looking.

1478
01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:36.870
Uh,
yeah.
I,
I'm only guilty of that when I get drunk.

1479
01:30:36.871 --> 01:30:40.470
Then I don't give a fuck.
I'm like,
Eh,
look at their,
their fucking titties on her.

1480
01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:45.700
Um,
excuse me quite down,
sweetheart.
I'm looking at you cleavage Ya.

1481
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:49.340
Anyway,
she says,
get a grip fag.
Uh,
like clockwork.

1482
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:53.610
If I am walking up an accident and accidentally make eye contact,

1483
01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:59.400
um,
this guy might look away for now,
but the second I pass him and turn around,

1484
01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:04.230
turn around to bust them.
Lo and behold,
he is fucking staring.

1485
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.650
All right.
I got to tell you something.
Staring at a woman,

1486
01:31:07.651 --> 01:31:12.150
making her feel uncomfortable is,
is definitely not cool.
Uh,

1487
01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:15.960
I totally agree with you on that,
but you know,
if you fucking walk by me,

1488
01:31:15.961 --> 01:31:18.720
I can turn around and check out your ass.
All right.
Yes.

1489
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:21.300
If you have a problem with that,
um,

1490
01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:24.600
I feel bad for you because one day you're going to turn around.

1491
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:30.360
I Dunno.
Could be when you're 27,
it could be when you're 47.

1492
01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:34.170
I don't know when,
but one day you're going to turn around and low and behold,

1493
01:31:34.171 --> 01:31:36.030
the dude is not going to be staring.

1494
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:40.620
And let me tell you something that is not a fun fucking day.
So enjoy those day.

1495
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:43.980
As long as he's not running back at you,
grabbing your ass,

1496
01:31:43.981 --> 01:31:46.560
if he's turning around,
checking you out,
there's nothing wrong.

1497
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:51.180
He's not fucking staring.
Staring is looking at when you're facing him,

1498
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:56.100
that staring,
staring in your eyes,
looking at your titties,

1499
01:31:56.101 --> 01:32:00.370
checking out your box,
really being disrespectful,

1500
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:03.490
that staring.
But when you walk by looking over your shoulder,
I mean,

1501
01:32:03.491 --> 01:32:06.940
that's a fucking,
you know,
it's a compliment.

1502
01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:10.390
If he continues to walk and turns around,
checks you out,

1503
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.040
that's actually a compliment.

1504
01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:17.020
If he stops and he's got one hand in his pocket and it appears that he's doing

1505
01:32:17.021 --> 01:32:21.130
half the mash potato dance like that,
that is offensive.

1506
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:26.560
Without a doubt.
Jesus,
where did I pull that on him?
Um,
that would be offensive,

1507
01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:29.230
right?
But it's around fucking staring at you.
Uh,

1508
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:33.340
that means that you're an attractive woman and stop being so conty and take it

1509
01:32:33.341 --> 01:32:34.780
as a compliment.
All right,

1510
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:37.840
I understand you walk by a construction site and they go,
Hey,

1511
01:32:37.841 --> 01:32:41.950
let me see your fucking panties or whatever the hell they yell,

1512
01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:48.010
you know,
whistling at you and all that type of shit.
I understand that.

1513
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.410
Yeah,
I totally get that.
You know,

1514
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:53.980
he treating you the same way I would be treated and when I first walked into a

1515
01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:55.900
prison facility holding my blanket,

1516
01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:02.590
I totally understand that.
But you know,

1517
01:33:02.591 --> 01:33:04.720
if he continues walking in the other direction,

1518
01:33:04.721 --> 01:33:08.590
it turns around and checks out your ass.
It's not wrong with that.
It's not wrong.

1519
01:33:08.591 --> 01:33:11.230
That means he liked what he saw.
That means look looking good.

1520
01:33:11.290 --> 01:33:15.400
That's all that that means.
He's not fucking staring.
All right.

1521
01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:20.860
Um,
anyway,
she goes on to say everyone notices hot girls and guys too,

1522
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:24.640
but it is rude to stare.
Okay,
I'll go with you halfway on that.
You know,

1523
01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:28.340
when you're looking at me,
I shouldn't be staring at you fucking chest.
Oh,

1524
01:33:28.341 --> 01:33:31.780
your hips or yeah,
so you're fucking hoo.
Ha.
Oh,

1525
01:33:31.781 --> 01:33:36.640
your legs or whatever.
Um,
but on the other side,

1526
01:33:36.641 --> 01:33:40.630
you know,
if you're really hot and you wear something really sexy,
I mean,

1527
01:33:41.170 --> 01:33:45.340
guys are only so like,
I dunno,
we're only so,

1528
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:48.250
we only have so much control over that.
You fucking with nature,

1529
01:33:48.251 --> 01:33:52.510
they're all right.
Yeah.
So I kind of blamed you in a way.

1530
01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:56.170
So you're right now,
somewhere in the middle of that I agreed with you.

1531
01:33:56.171 --> 01:33:59.290
Just take that.
You take that home with you.
I right there.
Tuts all right,

1532
01:33:59.291 --> 01:34:04.060
number three,
uh,
what is the nasty,
uh,
what is with the nasty bathroom habits?

1533
01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:05.560
Um,

1534
01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.370
I don't know if some men just don't notice or don't care that the outer rim of

1535
01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:12.190
their toilets are fucking disgusting.

1536
01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:15.250
Is it that hard to wipe off what miss the target?

1537
01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:20.810
A house with only single guys or a men's bar bathroom is proof that some

1538
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:27.370
may have horrendous,
some men have horrendous bathroom habits.

1539
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:28.803
Okay.

1540
01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.960
I'm absolutely 100% agree with you other than the public bathrooms.

1541
01:34:35.081 --> 01:34:36.430
There's nothing more disgusting.

1542
01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:40.180
The female's bathroom is actually more disgusting because you guys hover and you

1543
01:34:40.181 --> 01:34:42.770
can't see what the fuck you're aiming at.
All right.

1544
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:46.660
I used to work in a restaurant and one of my jobs was I had to clean the fucking

1545
01:34:46.661 --> 01:34:50.980
bathrooms and I don't know what the fuck you guys are using all that fucking

1546
01:34:50.981 --> 01:34:52.150
toilet.
It's like a ticket.

1547
01:34:52.151 --> 01:34:54.190
It's like some of you want to fucking championship in there.

1548
01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:58.370
You know the Canyon I heroes like there's all ticker tape and all kinds of shit

1549
01:34:58.371 --> 01:35:02.600
all over the floor.
It's fucking horrific.
And you guys piss all over the place.

1550
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.550
Uh,
you know.
Exactly.
You know what I mean?
US urinating.

1551
01:35:07.551 --> 01:35:09.440
At least we're looking at what were urinating you guys,

1552
01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:12.680
it's like a fucking trick shot and your shit faced in high heels.
Okay.

1553
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:15.770
And you're hovering.
Need I say more?
All right.

1554
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:19.040
But everything else that you said is,
is 100% true.

1555
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:21.650
I lived with guys when a,

1556
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:25.340
obviously when I was fucking single and all that type of shit and I never

1557
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.390
understood that.

1558
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.600
I never understood the fucking dirty dishes piled up to the ceiling or the,

1559
01:35:32.141 --> 01:35:35.120
or the food that you fucking ordered nine months ago and it,

1560
01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:40.070
and it has like disgusting mold on the side of it and thinking all that shit was

1561
01:35:40.071 --> 01:35:42.500
funny,
not mopping up the floor,

1562
01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:47.060
live in like a fucking animal slice of pizza in the cushion or however they

1563
01:35:47.061 --> 01:35:50.300
always try to make gut single guys,
you know,
you're like whenever they,

1564
01:35:50.301 --> 01:35:53.180
whenever they do in a Hollywood movie,
please,

1565
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:57.170
they used to do it like back in the day,
like whenever a single guy would get up,

1566
01:35:57.910 --> 01:36:01.040
uh,
just to demonstrate that he needs a woman in life.
It was actually,

1567
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:04.700
it was actually insulting to both sexes.
Uh,

1568
01:36:04.701 --> 01:36:09.260
it was basically saying that this guy needs a woman in his kitchen to start

1569
01:36:09.261 --> 01:36:11.600
fucking making some food or,
or something.

1570
01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:15.320
And it was insulting to the guy basically saying that guys that know how to take

1571
01:36:15.321 --> 01:36:19.580
care of themselves,
you know,
and I know that there are a lot of guys out there.

1572
01:36:19.581 --> 01:36:22.670
I know it's just comedy,
whatever it,
every fucking movie would always start off.

1573
01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.490
The guy would have like chocolate milk,

1574
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:29.810
half a beer left and he poured on some Froot loops and then mix the whole thing

1575
01:36:29.811 --> 01:36:33.560
together in a blender,
suck it down and then do a spit,
take it to the sink.

1576
01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:37.880
And then that was the deal to show that he needs a woman in his fucking life.

1577
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:41.090
But I,
I totally understand you.
It's fucking gross.

1578
01:36:41.091 --> 01:36:46.091
And there was nothing worse than when I would be on the road when I was younger

1579
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:51.020
and I would crash at Buddy's places and you'd go to get up,
hey,
can I,
you know,

1580
01:36:51.021 --> 01:36:53.720
can I take a shower before I go?
They'd be like,
yeah,
right.
And you,

1581
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:58.460
and they'd go to give you this fucking towel that,
you know,
they,

1582
01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:02.720
you know,
check their oil on,
wash their dog with and fucking,

1583
01:37:02.721 --> 01:37:04.550
I don't know what drove the car over it.

1584
01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:06.920
It felt like a fucking stiff piece of cardboard.

1585
01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.520
And then you go into this shower and it was just,
you couldn't touch anything.

1586
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:16.100
Hair all over the place,
fucking disc.
I never,
never fucking understood that.

1587
01:37:16.101 --> 01:37:18.470
And I want to tell you,
sweetheart,
I never lived like that.

1588
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.450
I've never fucking lived like that.

1589
01:37:20.451 --> 01:37:23.540
And one of my biggest fucking turnoffs ever are messy women.

1590
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:26.660
There's nothing worse than a messy woman.

1591
01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.140
Cause as much as I just stuck up for guys that were not all slobs,

1592
01:37:30.141 --> 01:37:34.310
it's like you're supposed to teach us how not to be fucking animals,
you know,

1593
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:37.640
the same way I'm supposed to,
you know,
teach you ditzy broads,

1594
01:37:37.641 --> 01:37:40.250
how to fucking change a light bulb,
you know,

1595
01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:43.580
cause you don't wanna get your nails to have your nails melted away.
Right.

1596
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:48.290
You're supposed to teach me how not to,
you know,
drink milk from nine months ago.

1597
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:52.100
So I'm actually the first girl I dated,

1598
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:57.870
she had a bedroom where she wouldn't let me in her bedroom for like the first

1599
01:37:57.871 --> 01:38:01.440
three months we dated,
you know,
so I just,
you know,

1600
01:38:01.441 --> 01:38:03.180
we just sort of hook up out in the living room,

1601
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.840
had to make sure her roommate wasn't home.
And I was like,
no,
honestly,
I'm,
I,

1602
01:38:07.841 --> 01:38:12.060
I don't,
you know,
three months.
I know you let me in.
And I,

1603
01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:15.030
and I went in there and,
uh,

1604
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:17.550
it was a combination storage bin.

1605
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.930
You don't look like you ever see those guys in New York City.

1606
01:38:21.931 --> 01:38:25.530
Like when they're selling shit illegally on the sidewalk and all of a sudden a

1607
01:38:25.531 --> 01:38:28.290
cop comes and they just grab it and they run like hell.

1608
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.690
Just imagine if after they ran like hell,

1609
01:38:30.691 --> 01:38:33.600
they just threw it into somebody's bedroom.
That's what the fuck it looked like.

1610
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.720
And you had to like,
it was like a hoarder.
She was like a fucking hoarder,

1611
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:40.260
but her roommate didn't tolerate it.
So it was all on her God damn bedroom.

1612
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:43.140
And I just immediate remember looking at this woman going like,
yeah,
this is,

1613
01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.960
you know,
we're going to live with this girl someday.

1614
01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:51.810
And then I continued a banger for another six months because I was young and I

1615
01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:54.300
was like,
but what if I never get another one

1616
01:38:57.030 --> 01:39:01.380
stupid.
Um,
anyway,
so let's plow ahead a number four,
trashing men.

1617
01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:03.000
The empire striking back here.

1618
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:07.200
I absolutely hate when men honked their horn at women on the street.

1619
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.930
I have lived.
You must be pretty hot if this,

1620
01:39:10.170 --> 01:39:12.990
like most of this has to do with you trying to get down the street without

1621
01:39:12.991 --> 01:39:17.640
getting leered at getting your butt pinched.
Uh,

1622
01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:18.660
what's your next one going to be?

1623
01:39:18.661 --> 01:39:23.190
I hate when I become a secretary in the boss thinks I'm going to blow him.
Um,

1624
01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:26.700
number four,
absolutely hate when men honk their horn.
It women on the street.

1625
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:28.740
I have lived on my,
uh,

1626
01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.960
I lived a lot of my life in an urban setting and I have walked busy side
streets,

1627
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:38.850
a shit ton.
Shit ton.
Okay.
What good does it do to honk your horn?

1628
01:39:38.851 --> 01:39:42.470
Like a faggy coward.
You don't,

1629
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:45.990
you sound like one of those women who like throw shit when you get mad.

1630
01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.020
Like I don't know what your energy,

1631
01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:53.340
I don't know what the fuck it is about the way you write stuff.
Um,

1632
01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:57.360
you don't write stuff like typically female where it's like,
God,

1633
01:39:57.361 --> 01:40:01.640
it's like so stupid.
It's like,
like a fucking fag.
Um,

1634
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:06.210
you do throw shit.
Um,
anyways.
Is it satisfying to them?

1635
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:09.700
Do they think they are paying a compliment?
Ooh.

1636
01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:14.100
That capital letters really makes me feel,
capital letter is so special.

1637
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:18.030
To have a dirt bag,
honk his fucking Horn beep.

1638
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.790
Usually follow his gesture up with the bird and allowed fuck off.

1639
01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:27.210
Oh,
that's what you do back.
That usually makes us laugh.

1640
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:30.330
I guess that what I guess that cat calls

1641
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:36.090
whistles and smoochy sounds or even I guess that,
oh,

1642
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:39.420
catcalls whistles and smoochy sounds are even worst.

1643
01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:43.140
What the fuck decade are you living in?
People still do that.

1644
01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:47.760
I just do not understand what the benefit of these actions are.
Um,

1645
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:53.480
oh,
ah,
from my side of the street.
Um,

1646
01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:57.960
all right.
There's a lot more on guys out there.
Okay.
Who's getting hope?

1647
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.120
One of them plays quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers and has one more ring

1648
01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:04.810
then fucking Peyton Manning's alright.
But I digress.
Um,

1649
01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.310
but then there's another thing,
there's a,

1650
01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.110
I know for guys to get laid,

1651
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:15.610
you have to understand we have to get over the fear of approaching women and

1652
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:20.530
getting rejected.
Like,
I know you guys have your level of rejection,
but like,
um,

1653
01:41:22.150 --> 01:41:25.350
I dunno as far other than humiliating yourself in front of a,

1654
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:30.450
an audience just for every regular guy.
I would think.
Yeah.

1655
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:32.770
The most humiliating thing is,

1656
01:41:32.771 --> 01:41:37.340
is to walk up to a female and um,

1657
01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.480
have her shut you down just because that whole bullshit of being a guy you're

1658
01:41:43.091 --> 01:41:43.924
just supposed to,

1659
01:41:44.130 --> 01:41:46.870
it's just like from day one you're supposed to know how to do it.

1660
01:41:47.710 --> 01:41:51.110
You supposed to,
uh,
know how to talk to women.
You supposed to,
you know,

1661
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:52.420
know all about sex.

1662
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:57.630
He supposed to be like worldly before you've even seen the outskirts of your

1663
01:41:58.131 --> 01:42:02.600
fucking town.
And uh,
you know,

1664
01:42:02.601 --> 01:42:05.650
I dunno now at the whole fucking emo generation,
I'm sure it's,

1665
01:42:05.651 --> 01:42:09.020
it's okay to now it's just say,
hey,
I don't know how to do this.

1666
01:42:09.021 --> 01:42:11.870
Can you give me some advice and reach out for help?
You know,

1667
01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:15.020
that Shit didn't exist when I was growing up.

1668
01:42:15.021 --> 01:42:17.210
Like they actually have reality shows about that.

1669
01:42:18.130 --> 01:42:19.780
<v 3>Remember that guy who had that debt,</v>

1670
01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.810
the lampshade from true romance on his fucking head.

1671
01:42:22.811 --> 01:42:27.800
Remember that reality show that guy was,
the guy was remember,
okay,
true romance.

1672
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:31.850
When Christian Slater's,
he's going in there,
he's talking to Gary Oldman,
he's,

1673
01:42:31.851 --> 01:42:35.180
he's pushing that lamp shade at the end,
his fucking head.

1674
01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:40.320
And uh,
this,
there was a reality show on VH one teaching these

1675
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:41.890
<v 11>nerdy guys how to pick up women.</v>

1676
01:42:41.891 --> 01:42:44.860
And that guy literally had that lampshade on his fucking head.

1677
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:47.860
And as dumb as it was,

1678
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:51.600
<v 3>if you have the balls to wear something like that,</v>

1679
01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:55.080
some woman is going to come up to you.
I'm not saying the good looking one,

1680
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:59.190
but some woman is going to be intrigued with the fact that you,

1681
01:42:59.191 --> 01:43:01.800
so don't give a fuck what people think,

1682
01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:04.200
that you would actually wear that thing on your fucking head.

1683
01:43:04.201 --> 01:43:08.610
That she would somehow perceive it as some level of confidence,
I guess.

1684
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:11.470
<v 11>And that you're going to do what the fuck you want life,</v>

1685
01:43:11.471 --> 01:43:15.700
which might translate to them on,
this is all speculation.
Um,

1686
01:43:15.701 --> 01:43:20.530
you guys can all correct me next week,
but under all that,
I don't give a fuck.

1687
01:43:20.531 --> 01:43:22.030
I do what the fuck I want to do.

1688
01:43:22.031 --> 01:43:27.031
I think females read that as in this guy is going to take what he wants in life.

1689
01:43:27.761 --> 01:43:29.740
This guy is not as scared little bitch.

1690
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:32.950
Therefore he's going to get what he wants and if he gets what he wants,

1691
01:43:32.951 --> 01:43:36.760
he's going to be able to provide,
which is what I need because when he not,

1692
01:43:36.761 --> 01:43:41.560
when I get knocked up,
I'm out of the game.
I'm on injured,
reserved,

1693
01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:45.530
<v 3>just sitting there,
you know,
with a swollen fucking belly.</v>

1694
01:43:46.290 --> 01:43:49.260
<v 11>Can you go this Sunday?
No,
no sir.
I cannot,</v>

1695
01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:52.440
I cannot write who the fuck's gonna to you.

1696
01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.630
Do you realize how fucking scare of that is?
I just realized that like,
uh,

1697
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:57.950
just as a,
you know,
being a guy,

1698
01:43:57.951 --> 01:44:01.060
like you never think about that shit as far as you know,

1699
01:44:01.061 --> 01:44:04.960
being able to pay your rent,
how fucking bad women have it that you,

1700
01:44:04.961 --> 01:44:06.880
you got to go out there and try it and not

1701
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:08.940
<v 3>to get a fucking loser.</v>

1702
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:13.311
<v 11>Like,</v>

1703
01:44:13.311 --> 01:44:18.311
really just sit there and be like going in there and trying to pick out the

1704
01:44:18.481 --> 01:44:23.240
person who's going to be able to have your back for not only,
I guess,
you know,

1705
01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:26.850
women can,
you know,
tough it out for the first two trimesters that you know.

1706
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:28.160
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1707
01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:31.310
<v 11>My Jesus Christ.
Some of them right up until like I'm giving birth next week.</v>

1708
01:44:31.311 --> 01:44:34.010
Right.
Isn't that how it goes?
Then?
They just fucking,

1709
01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:36.820
I don't know.

1710
01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:39.880
They're like hockey players just get stitched right up on the fucking bench and

1711
01:44:39.881 --> 01:44:43.000
they're right back in there.
Right.
I didn't mean it like that.

1712
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:46.120
If you thought I meant like,
you know,
oh,
that was really disgusting.

1713
01:44:46.121 --> 01:44:48.570
I didn't mean it that way.
I was trying to compare it to hockey.
Oof.

1714
01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.640
Really in a pit right now.
See if I can crawl out.
Um,
yeah,
that must be in a,
uh,

1715
01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:57.140
like if I like walking into a bar,
I used to just,

1716
01:44:57.260 --> 01:45:01.910
I would walk in there and I would be thinking like a guy like,
all right,

1717
01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:07.750
who's the hottest girl in here?
That would actually still consider fucking me.

1718
01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:15.250
So it was never the best looking chicks.
That's if I could go back in time.

1719
01:45:15.251 --> 01:45:18.700
That was the one thing that I really don't like about myself is I,

1720
01:45:18.701 --> 01:45:21.490
whenever I saw the hottest girls in the bar,
I immediately just said,

1721
01:45:21.491 --> 01:45:24.430
add Jesus Christ.
You know,
I'll leave that to the fucking quarterbacks.

1722
01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:26.440
I was so conditioned in my head

1723
01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:30.080
<v 3>to where I was in the fucking pecking order that I didn't even,</v>

1724
01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:32.450
I didn't even try it.
So I went with the a,

1725
01:45:32.690 --> 01:45:36.260
I went after like sevens and eights.
You know,

1726
01:45:36.261 --> 01:45:40.310
it wasn't until I got into show business and danced around like a fucking God

1727
01:45:40.311 --> 01:45:41.700
damn monkey on stage.

1728
01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:46.320
Even then the good looking ones who came up to you are fucking crazy.
Um,

1729
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:50.110
Jesus Christ,
I'm about 45 minutes in here.
She'd quit babbling,

1730
01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.790
let sa Sa actually right there.
That was one of the rare times on this podcast.

1731
01:45:54.791 --> 01:45:58.600
I actually tried to look at it from a female's perspective and actually gave you

1732
01:45:58.601 --> 01:46:02.910
props that has to be really difficult and fucking scary.
And,
um,

1733
01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:07.330
I think we've had plenty of stories of guys talking about nightmare chicks who

1734
01:46:07.331 --> 01:46:09.430
come in and take him for everything that fucking worth.

1735
01:46:09.850 --> 01:46:13.570
How about all these women out there with who you,
you,
you looked at a guy,

1736
01:46:13.571 --> 01:46:17.650
he looked like a fucking winner.
All right.
And then he just,

1737
01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:21.790
he just ended up being this fucking loser sitting on a goddamn couch,

1738
01:46:21.791 --> 01:46:25.330
playing video games,
eating donuts as you're sitting there pregnant going like,

1739
01:46:25.331 --> 01:46:28.900
really?
This is,
this is this guy.
This is the dude.

1740
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:32.030
This is how you provide.
You know what I mean?

1741
01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:36.020
And if there's any females out there who have any sort of inside information on

1742
01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:40.700
how to read guys,
so you don't end up with that dude,
by all means,
by all means,

1743
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:45.500
write in and I will read the shit or at least attempt to and stutter over the

1744
01:46:45.501 --> 01:46:49.940
God damn words.
All right,
number five.
It's not over yet.
All right,

1745
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:50.783
number five.

1746
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:55.620
I do not like when some guys cannot control themselves in stare at tits and ass.

1747
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:58.980
Did you already say this?
Doesn't this go under staring?

1748
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:03.630
Is this an offshoot as it's like a spinoff when flow got her own show off of

1749
01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:05.300
Alice.
Um,

1750
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:10.310
instead of respecting the women by speaking to her face while making eye contact

1751
01:47:10.981 --> 01:47:15.570
and just using their peripheral vision to get a good idea of her tits and ass.

1752
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.330
You know what?
Go Fuck yourself on this one.

1753
01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:20.730
Why don't you put your fucking tits away,
sweetheart?
Okay.

1754
01:47:20.731 --> 01:47:22.530
You don't want people staring at your tits and ass.

1755
01:47:22.531 --> 01:47:27.060
Stop wearing those fucking hip hugging jeans with your little booty crack coming

1756
01:47:27.061 --> 01:47:30.120
out.
Stop wearing the shit with the cleavage.
All right?

1757
01:47:31.770 --> 01:47:33.990
Jesus Christ.
Why don't you just fucking walk in their top?

1758
01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.340
That's the thing I've always hated.
You know,
hello.
I'm up here.
Well,

1759
01:47:38.341 --> 01:47:40.560
you know what?
You're not as good looking as you tit sweetheart.

1760
01:47:40.561 --> 01:47:43.890
So why don't you fucking put him away and he's back.

1761
01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:47.490
The chauvinistic cunt is back.
All right,
let's finish reading this.
Um,

1762
01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:52.350
I have one friend in particular who was terrible at this.

1763
01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:57.570
He even will walk 20 feet out of his way to be at a good angle to see down his

1764
01:47:57.571 --> 01:48:01.560
shirt or window or skirt.
All right.
That guy is a pervert and a,

1765
01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:04.980
I got to admit I'm a pervert too.
I swear to God,

1766
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:08.220
if you have a fucking skirt on that's really short and you're about ready to

1767
01:48:08.221 --> 01:48:11.150
walk up some stairs,
uh,
you know,
I'm going to do,

1768
01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.550
I'm going to do a little march in place that you get a good fucking 10 stairs in

1769
01:48:14.551 --> 01:48:18.870
front of me.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm not going to look.
I am going to look.

1770
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:22.770
Where's some pants?
If you don't want it to happen,
I take the fucking elevator.

1771
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:27.450
I'm looking,
I'm looking.

1772
01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:29.820
You know what?
You know what the thing is too.
You know what it is.

1773
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:33.870
They want you to look,
oh yeah,
they want it.
I'm fucking with you.
Um,

1774
01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.210
what is going,
uh,
anyways,
what does that going to do for him?

1775
01:48:36.211 --> 01:48:40.950
I wonder if he has heard of the Internet.
There is way better shit on there.

1776
01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.900
There isn't sweetheart.
There's nothing better than seeing live titties.

1777
01:48:47.490 --> 01:48:51.780
Okay.
And you can never see enough of them.
So he's probably on the Internet too,

1778
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:56.550
and whenever he can,
he's just checking out titties.
Um,
anyways,

1779
01:48:56.551 --> 01:48:59.160
continuing,
uh,
it is the 21st century.

1780
01:48:59.161 --> 01:49:03.360
You can see millions of bare tits and ass and the comfort of your home.

1781
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:04.860
I don't get to distraction.

1782
01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:09.900
That's a classic fucking argument that if you put it in the,
in the right,
uh,

1783
01:49:10.290 --> 01:49:12.780
in a different situation,
you would argue the other side.

1784
01:49:12.781 --> 01:49:15.900
What if you were in a relationship with some guy and he's looking at tits and

1785
01:49:15.901 --> 01:49:18.270
ass on the Internet?
You'd be standing there like,
really?

1786
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:21.450
You'd rather look at this shit that you can't really even interact with?

1787
01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:26.340
Then I got live titties and ass right here.
Why don't you come over here,
see,

1788
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:29.150
see what I did there.
Um,
anyways,

1789
01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.520
initially I thought that I could compile a huge list trashing men,

1790
01:49:32.521 --> 01:49:36.710
but I've realized that as I'm growing up,
I've calmed down.
Um,

1791
01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:41.310
some with my auntie men attitude.
I have many male friends who I care for dearly.

1792
01:49:41.311 --> 01:49:45.270
Uh,
this is all nice.
I am a fan of many male comedians,

1793
01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:48.520
musicians and artists and no way do I hate all men.
Now,

1794
01:49:48.521 --> 01:49:53.020
why are you taking it all away?
I liked what you wrote.
All right.

1795
01:49:53.021 --> 01:49:55.440
Here's someone who just straight up fucking hates guys.

1796
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:58.480
Let's read this real quick and if you bitching about it as a guide,

1797
01:49:58.481 --> 01:50:01.540
we fucking deserve because I got three years of podcasts,
trash and women.

1798
01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:03.370
Here we go.
Uh,
number one,

1799
01:50:03.371 --> 01:50:06.610
guys who think one good conversation means they're in.

1800
01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:09.190
I can't tell you how many guys I've spoken to,

1801
01:50:09.191 --> 01:50:12.640
a grand total of once who think that just because they made me laugh during

1802
01:50:12.641 --> 01:50:17.530
light conversation that I will automatically bed them.
I'm sorry.
No,

1803
01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:20.590
the world doesn't work like a porno said to tell you.

1804
01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:25.330
All right.
Wire to wire.
That's perfect.
Can't fuck with that.

1805
01:50:25.331 --> 01:50:29.380
Number two guys who use acts as a replacement for showering.

1806
01:50:29.590 --> 01:50:34.090
I hope I said that right.
I'm seriously stop it.
Yeah,
you smell good now,

1807
01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:35.770
but as soon as you walk away,

1808
01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:40.980
that second cloud of ball smells is going to be waiting after you and no girl is

1809
01:50:41.231 --> 01:50:43.720
dying to get with that two foot two

1810
01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:48.970
dudes who can't flirt.
Needin try.
Uh,

1811
01:50:48.971 --> 01:50:52.690
this is an actual conversation.
I had him.
What are you doing?

1812
01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:55.630
Me Watching Jersey shore.
You,

1813
01:50:55.840 --> 01:51:00.640
him wondering if you'd sub Dick.
Uh,

1814
01:51:00.641 --> 01:51:03.970
wondering if you suck Dick.
Wow.

1815
01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:09.310
And then her response was,
wow,
just,
oh my God.
All right,
number four,

1816
01:51:09.490 --> 01:51:11.500
learn to kiss fellas.

1817
01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:16.030
I know that when you practice on your hand and think you've got skills and think

1818
01:51:16.031 --> 01:51:16.601
you got skill,

1819
01:51:16.601 --> 01:51:20.380
but when you attempt to French kiss and you end up basically eating my mouth,

1820
01:51:20.381 --> 01:51:24.760
that's not good.
A sweetheart that works both ways.
Um,

1821
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:27.340
female,
stop thinking just because you're female,

1822
01:51:27.341 --> 01:51:31.000
you're automatically sensual and you have a nice touch and you know how to kiss

1823
01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:33.640
it is a fucking skill.
Some people are born with it,

1824
01:51:33.641 --> 01:51:36.340
but not everybody that kissing things.
The only one I'll fuck with you on.

1825
01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.780
All right.
I believe I've told this story before,
but I want to tell it again.

1826
01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:44.530
All right,
I'm in this,
I'm in a bar,
right?
I'm chatting up this broad.
Okay.

1827
01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:47.380
She short.
Okay.
For arm to something fucked up with her arms.

1828
01:51:47.381 --> 01:51:50.650
I can't really tell like that chick who makes the Italian food on the food

1829
01:51:50.651 --> 01:51:53.740
network.
If you ever really start looking at our arms,
she's cute as a button,

1830
01:51:53.741 --> 01:51:55.180
but there's something with their fucking arms.

1831
01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:59.380
She's just not a dwarf.

1832
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:04.990
Um,
anyways,
so it was one of those deals.
But whoever,
she was cute though,
right?

1833
01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:05.853
So

1834
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:12.190
aside from our Jack in the box arms,
he was fucking cute.
All right.

1835
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:15.130
So I go lean in,
right?
We're going to make out or whatever.

1836
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:19.960
I was fucking in there right now.
When you go to kiss somebody for those,

1837
01:52:19.961 --> 01:52:22.670
you don't,
not a kiss.
You pick a lip.
Either you're going high,

1838
01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:26.650
they're going low or vice versa.
But with this girl would do,
when I went,
hi,

1839
01:52:26.651 --> 01:52:29.680
she went higher.
If I went picked the lower lip,
she went lower lip.

1840
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:33.220
She would basically do upper lip to upper lip,
lower lip to low,
low.

1841
01:52:33.221 --> 01:52:36.790
That's what she was kept trying to do.
And I got so frustrated.
At one point,

1842
01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:39.670
I literally grabbed two handfuls of hair.

1843
01:52:39.671 --> 01:52:43.750
I was a little drunk on both sides of her head and tried to,

1844
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:49.520
<v 11>tried to help her.
Needless to say,
after she kissed me at my Dick was just like,</v>

1845
01:52:49.521 --> 01:52:51.500
all right,
dude,
you're on your own.
You're on your own.
On this one.

1846
01:52:51.501 --> 01:52:55.970
I don't know what you want to do,
but uh,
I'm good.
I'm going to bed now.

1847
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:59.150
See you see in the morning,
you know,

1848
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:05.210
I think I told that other story,
that girl doggy style,
you know,

1849
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:11.330
when I move forward,
you move back.
Sounds like a rap song.
Uh,

1850
01:53:11.331 --> 01:53:13.980
is that a ludicrous song?
Um,

1851
01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:16.491
when I move forward,

1852
01:53:16.491 --> 01:53:19.040
you move back and then we both separate and then we come together again,

1853
01:53:19.041 --> 01:53:21.890
like fucking magnets.
That's how you do it.
This girl would basically,

1854
01:53:21.891 --> 01:53:24.980
when I went forward,
she went forward and when I went back she went back.

1855
01:53:24.981 --> 01:53:29.090
So we just sort of rocking together.
So I was,
uh,

1856
01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:33.260
I was inside the building,
but uh,

1857
01:53:33.261 --> 01:53:36.950
there was no friction to once again,
my dick started being like,
you know,

1858
01:53:36.951 --> 01:53:40.970
if this is how it's going to be,
I think,
uh,
you know,
I got work in the morning,

1859
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:45.320
so once again I had to fucking grab her by the back of the neck.

1860
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:50.180
Like some fucking insubordinate Hell Hound,
no,

1861
01:53:50.181 --> 01:53:54.140
the hand on her hip and I had to hold her still for a second as I went back.

1862
01:53:54.141 --> 01:53:57.950
And then I brought her to me and then say,
see that day you go,

1863
01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.750
there you go.
All right,
but I understand this woman.
You don't,

1864
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:05.990
you don't kiss other women.
So there you go.
All right,
number five guys.

1865
01:54:05.991 --> 01:54:09.200
Who by the way,
this is fucking killer list here.
Number five,

1866
01:54:09.201 --> 01:54:12.800
guys who insist on a girl who's hairless.

1867
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:18.790
I don't think guys realize how much work it takes for a woman to maintain silky

1868
01:54:18.861 --> 01:54:21.290
smooth skin all the time,
but it is a pain.

1869
01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:26.240
It wouldn't be so bad to keep it up if the guys did the same,
but sadly,

1870
01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:31.300
a lot of furry little men stick their noses up at the ideas.

1871
01:54:32.170 --> 01:54:36.770
Um,
how can we be forced to do it when you're Chinchilla asked?
Doesn't.

1872
01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:43.010
Um,
someone else made a list and was just talking about the pedophile tendency of

1873
01:54:43.011 --> 01:54:46.250
that.
And I could not agree more.
I think it's creepy.

1874
01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:50.690
100% hairless is fucking creepy.
All right.

1875
01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:56.480
I'd like a nice manicured lawn,
please.
That's all a mascot for.
Yeah,

1876
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:57.500
that other thing.
Yeah,

1877
01:54:57.630 --> 01:55:02.570
that's just know the Calvin Klein ad,
as I call it.

1878
01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.300
Remember those creepy ads he had with the fucking people kids down in the

1879
01:55:05.301 --> 01:55:06.290
goddamn basement.

1880
01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:11.540
I'd still think that's truly one of the few times in life when I actually get

1881
01:55:11.541 --> 01:55:16.320
offended.
I really,
it really bothers me when,
uh,
they,

1882
01:55:16.330 --> 01:55:20.720
that ad campaign and when they have like 14 year old models,

1883
01:55:22.130 --> 01:55:22.521
you know,

1884
01:55:22.521 --> 01:55:26.660
sitting on a swing dress like they're 22 and they look like they just got roof

1885
01:55:26.661 --> 01:55:31.430
feed.
That's really,
um,
I don't get it.

1886
01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:34.460
I really don't get that at all.
Uh,
I don't know if it's,

1887
01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:39.461
cause there's a lot of gay guys in fashion and they don't realize how tripi

1888
01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:44.550
straight guys view that.
I don't know what,

1889
01:55:44.551 --> 01:55:48.660
but whoever's your,
they're really missing the mark on that.
That's just,

1890
01:55:48.661 --> 01:55:50.400
it's fucking unbelievably creepy.

1891
01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:52.900
And it actually makes me angry when I see it and I,

1892
01:55:52.901 --> 01:55:56.790
and I want to find the guy who came up with it and uh,

1893
01:55:56.850 --> 01:56:01.150
and fucking punch him in the face because it's,
it's,
it's wrong fucking road.

1894
01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:05.130
It's just,
you know,
and believe me,
for me to be saying something's wrong,

1895
01:56:05.131 --> 01:56:08.220
it has to be fucking wrong because I really don't give a shit about most things.

1896
01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:09.930
All right?
But yeah,

1897
01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:14.960
enough with the fucking sexy 14 year old who looks like she just got drugged and

1898
01:56:15.121 --> 01:56:19.710
can't stand up on her fucking Bambi legs.
I really,
that's fucked.
It's fucked up.

1899
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:23.660
Okay.
Number six.
And lastly,
uh,

1900
01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:26.670
men who assume oral is always on the table.

1901
01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:29.670
You are boring.

1902
01:56:29.671 --> 01:56:34.410
A bad driver didn't pay for my movie ticket made me listen to speed metal while

1903
01:56:34.411 --> 01:56:37.440
we were in traffic.
But you think that you deserve to be blown.

1904
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:41.790
You have dirty hair.
I can only imagine what state your Dick is in.

1905
01:56:42.770 --> 01:56:45.180
Oh,
that she writes.
What's that in your eye?
Oh,

1906
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:49.380
it's just a sparkle that,
you know what?
That was phenomenal.

1907
01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.820
Phenomenal points.
Phenomenally written.
Um,
I'm liking this.

1908
01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:58.140
The empire strikes back,
the women coming back at us.
We fucking deserve it.

1909
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.340
Uh,
let's see if I think I got it.
Okay.
Let's get to overrated.

1910
01:57:02.341 --> 01:57:06.110
Underrated for the week.
This podcast is getting a little old here.
56.
Uh,

1911
01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:09.280
overrated.
I like this one here.
This guy writes in,

1912
01:57:09.281 --> 01:57:13.260
he says the use of the word epic to describe everything.

1913
01:57:13.890 --> 01:57:16.260
And you know what's funny after I was just like,
all that's a classic.

1914
01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:17.610
I got to put that on the podcast.

1915
01:57:17.611 --> 01:57:20.940
And then I was driving down the street and there's some,
um,

1916
01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:25.500
new show coming out in the advertising billboard says,

1917
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:30.630
um,
something about the epic of epicness,

1918
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:35.580
you know,
just classic people in the motion picture or whatever,
TV industry.

1919
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:39.990
They liked it.
We keep finding the word epic on Youtube.

1920
01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:43.620
Let's use it in our advertising.
Um,

1921
01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:45.031
kind of like,

1922
01:57:45.031 --> 01:57:47.790
remember when they were trying to figure out grunge and they just couldn't

1923
01:57:47.791 --> 01:57:51.900
figure it out.
How to advertise to the,
I don't give a fuck man.

1924
01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:54.840
I'm going to shoot myself in the face generation,
right.

1925
01:57:54.841 --> 01:57:58.950
That I semi came up and I'm like,
half in grunge,
half in hair metal.
Right.

1926
01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:03.030
So they actually came up with that movie called feeling Minnesota.

1927
01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:08.460
I believe Keanu Reeves was in it.
I think it was a,
uh,
uh,
Soundgarden lyric.

1928
01:58:09.710 --> 01:58:13.680
Um,
I dunno what I'm anyways,
overrated.
Uh,

1929
01:58:13.681 --> 01:58:17.730
working in a job you hate and don't want to do anymore.

1930
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:21.510
I feel like my job is slowly killing me and I need to find something else,

1931
01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:25.440
but I'm dragging my feet thanks to this economy.
Yeah,
Dude.

1932
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.590
Well the great thing is you've expressed it out loud.

1933
01:58:28.591 --> 01:58:31.800
You've written it and now I've said it out loud.
So you'll get out of that.
Yeah.

1934
01:58:31.801 --> 01:58:35.940
You don't like it?
Just get out.
Get Out.

1935
01:58:35.970 --> 01:58:39.870
Just find something else.
Anything fucking it.
Not Anything,
but you know,

1936
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:43.720
just every,
you just take another swing at the fucking tree.

1937
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:45.880
Eventually a chop it down.
Uh,

1938
01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:50.950
and get the fuck out of there because it's your life.
All right.
Um,

1939
01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:56.320
what is this?
Oh,
this is some more men trashing a men with huge muscles.

1940
01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:59.590
I think we already,
I'm not just talking about the steroid freaks,

1941
01:58:59.650 --> 01:59:03.490
I'm including those guys whose necks are hidden by their overdeveloped shoulder

1942
01:59:03.491 --> 01:59:08.290
muscles and who's pecs could fill a C Cup Bra.
And for Christ's sake,

1943
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:11.290
stop talking about your workout routines.

1944
01:59:11.650 --> 01:59:16.030
I don't care how many reps you did while exercising your idiot toys or how much

1945
01:59:16.031 --> 01:59:17.080
you can bench press.

1946
01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:22.030
Just mentioned the fact that the bar you use to bench press ways by itself,

1947
01:59:22.031 --> 01:59:25.780
40 pound.
Uh,
wait a minute,
I just lost a sentence here.
I'm so fucking dumb.

1948
01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:29.620
Just mentioned the fact that the bar you use to bench press ways by itself,

1949
01:59:29.621 --> 01:59:33.490
40 pounds,
45 pounds,
and that you added some heavy crap on,

1950
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:38.910
on that heavy crap on that alone impresses me and doesn't bore me to death.

1951
01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:43.510
And that was actually a great point and I butchered it.
Number two,
a shaving,

1952
01:59:43.930 --> 01:59:45.370
I'm not talking about men's shaving,

1953
01:59:45.371 --> 01:59:49.810
their face is please do it because we women hate stubble.
Okay?
Honestly,

1954
01:59:49.811 --> 01:59:51.340
we love it.
Movies and on TV,

1955
01:59:51.341 --> 01:59:55.780
but the beard burn in real life is just not pleasant.
Uh,

1956
01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:00.310
it's not shaving,
it's not women's shaving.
Their pubic hair that is overrated.

1957
02:00:00.311 --> 02:00:02.560
Naked pussies are,
oh,
here's a woman.
Naked.

1958
02:00:02.561 --> 02:00:07.561
Pussies are another product of our culture's obsession with super thin models

1959
02:00:07.811 --> 02:00:10.990
and actresses and it is sick.
Think about it this way.

1960
02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:14.950
Keira Knightley naked.
I don't know who that is.

1961
02:00:14.951 --> 02:00:19.951
Naked looks more like a 10 year old boy than a 25 year old woman in ladies who

1962
02:00:21.131 --> 02:00:25.060
actually have sizable breasts and shave crutches.

1963
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:28.300
Look like women on top of little girls on the bottom.
Yeah,

1964
02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:30.490
see that's just fucking gross.
This is the woman.

1965
02:00:30.491 --> 02:00:34.330
This trend makes me think that all men are secretly pedophiles and liked to

1966
02:00:34.331 --> 02:00:38.380
imagine raping children.
All right.
You know.
Okay.

1967
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:41.350
I think pedophiles work.
You really took it the whole nine yards.

1968
02:00:41.770 --> 02:00:45.400
So she said you're pretty predictable.
Rent defending men goes here.

1969
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:47.810
Now Sweetheart,
I'm not fucking defended your,
I'm,

1970
02:00:47.811 --> 02:00:52.660
I'm so I understand your side on that one.
Um,

1971
02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:56.590
I can already hear you accusing me of being a fat bitter broad.

1972
02:00:57.250 --> 02:01:00.070
This is how bad I am.
They're anticipating be saying this shit.

1973
02:01:00.071 --> 02:01:04.150
This is why I'm doing this segment because I've completely lost credibility with

1974
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:06.850
the female audience here.
Uh,
she says I'm not.

1975
02:01:06.851 --> 02:01:10.000
I'm 26 and while my bathroom scale,
if I had one,

1976
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:13.720
wouldn't would be over one 30.
Um,

1977
02:01:13.721 --> 02:01:16.630
I've been in a relationship for seven years and dated other people before that.

1978
02:01:16.631 --> 02:01:20.020
So it's not like a fluke that a guy is interested in me.
Oh yeah.

1979
02:01:20.021 --> 02:01:23.470
You don't need to justify yourself.
You made great points.
All right.
Underrated.

1980
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:24.910
Uh,
the,
these are from me here.

1981
02:01:25.810 --> 02:01:28.270
I'm actually gonna contribute here so you guys don't have to work all the

1982
02:01:28.271 --> 02:01:32.590
fucking time.
He can kick back and you cubicles and relax.
Underrated drinking.

1983
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:36.830
This is from,
this is from me.
This is from my heart to you people.
Uh,

1984
02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:40.310
drinking a beer on your porch or balcony.
The end of the day.

1985
02:01:41.330 --> 02:01:43.460
I did it the other day.
Got a little fucking balcony,

1986
02:01:43.461 --> 02:01:46.430
one of those one bedroom apartment balconies and I just sat out there.

1987
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:47.600
It's impossible.

1988
02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:51.980
I don't give a fuck what is going on in your life as a man to sit on a porch

1989
02:01:52.130 --> 02:01:55.580
with a little breeze going at dusk,
right?

1990
02:01:55.940 --> 02:02:00.770
Drinking a beer with it.
It's impossible to not feel successful.

1991
02:02:01.730 --> 02:02:05.390
You feel like he just fucking completed the transcontinental railroad near the

1992
02:02:05.391 --> 02:02:09.440
guy drove in the golden spike.
Um,

1993
02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:13.550
all right.
Um,
here's my next one.
Underrated.

1994
02:02:13.551 --> 02:02:16.820
Actually using your car as a place to park your car.

1995
02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:22.760
Um,
I just feel it's a good sign that you're a well adjusted human being if you

1996
02:02:22.761 --> 02:02:27.761
actually put your car in the garage and if you have a bunch of clutter in

1997
02:02:27.891 --> 02:02:30.560
garbage in your fucking,
uh,

1998
02:02:30.561 --> 02:02:34.880
if you use your garage as storage also,
you know,

1999
02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:37.370
and then I think that's,
you know,
that's like the Bronx tale.

2000
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:40.460
That's just the tip of the iceberg and you really just need to get out of that

2001
02:02:40.461 --> 02:02:45.280
fucking relationship.
Um,
all right.
Uh,

2002
02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:47.000
we're well over an hour.
Should I keep going?

2003
02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:49.580
Do you guys have something better to do?
I don't think you'd do.

2004
02:02:49.581 --> 02:02:52.340
I'm gonna keep going here.
Underrated,
professional courtesy.

2005
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:56.570
I worked for a cell cellular provider in a call center and the sheer amount of

2006
02:02:56.571 --> 02:03:01.520
ignorant assholes that call me and curse at me for no reason is astounding.

2007
02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:05.540
Now,
what does that go back to podcast listeners?

2008
02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:09.980
This guy's getting cursed at because people don't listen to my podcast and they

2009
02:03:09.981 --> 02:03:13.430
don't realize that you don't curse at that guy after he says what he's,

2010
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:16.940
what he's supposed to say.
You just tell him that's unacceptable.

2011
02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:19.460
I need to talk to somebody above you.
That's what you do.

2012
02:03:19.461 --> 02:03:24.120
This guy's getting cursed out because people just lack the ability or they
don't.

2013
02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:28.100
If they don't have the knowledge to just say it's unacceptable.
Um,
all right.

2014
02:03:28.130 --> 02:03:32.560
Number one,
underrated a sobriety.
Um,

2015
02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.720
I don't have time to read all these fucking things.
Sobriety,
I started,

2016
02:03:35.721 --> 02:03:38.390
I got to finish it.
See,
even the word makes,

2017
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:44.930
uh,
is this underrated sobriety.
See,
even the word makes being not fucked up.

2018
02:03:44.931 --> 02:03:47.180
Sound boring.
Uh,
to these people.

2019
02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:51.440
Do people these days lack the intelligence and imagination to have fun without

2020
02:03:51.441 --> 02:03:53.510
being stoned or drunk off their asses?

2021
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:57.770
I'd never seen the appeal in having random words come out of my mouth rubbing up

2022
02:03:57.771 --> 02:04:02.030
against a stranger then falling down and passing out amongst people.
I wouldn't,

2023
02:04:02.210 --> 02:04:04.040
I wouldn't trust to walk my dog.

2024
02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.120
If your life sucks so much that you would rather be silly sitting at a dirty,

2025
02:04:08.121 --> 02:04:12.500
dim lit bar or smoking pot with strange people living in their parents'
basement,

2026
02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:16.850
then do something to change it.
Don't become numb to your life.
Rage,

2027
02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:22.460
rage against the routine.
And if your life isn't that bad,
why risk your health,

2028
02:04:22.461 --> 02:04:25.130
money and sanity on recreational poisons,

2029
02:04:25.670 --> 02:04:28.550
you know at that might be one of the greatest arguments I've ever had for being

2030
02:04:28.551 --> 02:04:32.780
sober.
It has an override.
Rided my sitting on the porch drinking a beer,

2031
02:04:32.781 --> 02:04:34.790
which I'm going to do right after this fucking podcast,

2032
02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:38.340
a number two girl geeks.

2033
02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:44.540
Why are men so obsessed with the size to party girls at fashion and fashion?

2034
02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:50.280
Niesters can we just stop here for a second?
Amen.

2035
02:04:50.281 --> 02:04:52.290
Aren't you?

2036
02:04:52.291 --> 02:04:56.160
Don't you know why I know what a fashion needs is because of my girlfriend.

2037
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:58.230
She loves all of those blogs.

2038
02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:03.300
She goes on all of those things and she constantly bitches about those size to

2039
02:05:03.301 --> 02:05:06.480
fucking women and she always says that guys are into them.

2040
02:05:07.710 --> 02:05:11.040
You guys are the one who read vogue.
You're the ones who read cosmo.

2041
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:15.120
You're the one.
They don't have those women in sports illustrated.
They don't.

2042
02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:19.920
And when they do the swimsuit issue,
they're not sized to.
Okay,
go fuck yourself.

2043
02:05:19.921 --> 02:05:24.210
They're not granted.
I don't know what a fucking size two is,
but size two,

2044
02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:28.560
that's that little,
uh,
those lollipop look and girls,
the big fucking heads,

2045
02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:31.200
you know,
they look like raggedy Ann dolls,

2046
02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:33.580
but you grabbed it by the neck like you were gonna.

2047
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.440
You just run out the stuffing through the doll feet.
That's what they look like.

2048
02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:42.960
Um,
so yeah,
blame the people in the fashion industry.
I mean,
the,

2049
02:05:42.961 --> 02:05:47.490
the,
the hacky theory is that there's a bunch of gay guys in,
uh,

2050
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.100
in fashion and they're more attractive to two guys.

2051
02:05:54.210 --> 02:05:55.500
I don't know if I've just always heard that.

2052
02:05:55.501 --> 02:06:00.150
So they're trying to make them have no curves.
I don't know what,

2053
02:06:00.151 --> 02:06:01.650
but yeah,
no,
I'm not into that.

2054
02:06:01.651 --> 02:06:04.680
I'm not into that looking like you can barely fucking stand up.

2055
02:06:04.681 --> 02:06:09.660
I'm not into that.
Um,
I'll tell you what I like.
Go,
go,
go,
go,

2056
02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:14.070
look up.
Cool Hand Luke and look at the CIC wash in the fucking car.
All right,

2057
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:17.850
go look up that on youtube.
We'll actually have the clip on the MM podcasts.

2058
02:06:17.851 --> 02:06:19.920
Look that up.
Um,

2059
02:06:19.921 --> 02:06:23.790
if you want to be in a relationship where you can relax and not be nagged to

2060
02:06:23.791 --> 02:06:26.160
dress well and go do something,

2061
02:06:26.161 --> 02:06:28.590
you want a girl who is more interested in surfing,
attended.

2062
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:30.030
I don't know where the fuck to go with this.

2063
02:06:30.031 --> 02:06:31.920
I don't even know where to pick that up.
All right,
I'm done.

2064
02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:36.870
I'm done with the podcast.
I'm well over an hour.
Um,
and that's it.

2065
02:06:36.871 --> 02:06:39.510
That's the podcast for this week.
Lot of reading,
by the way.

2066
02:06:40.290 --> 02:06:43.150
That's why it was an hour and five minutes because I'm not the best reader if

2067
02:06:43.151 --> 02:06:46.890
you,
as you've noticed.
So that's a podcast for this week.
This week,

2068
02:06:46.891 --> 02:06:48.240
football season starts.

2069
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:53.310
Let the shit talk and begin a patriots have the bangles next week.

2070
02:06:53.850 --> 02:06:58.710
My prediction is the patriots come out with a big victory.
Um,

2071
02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:03.840
I just think,
uh,
I don't know.
It's been real quiet up in New England.
I like it.

2072
02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:09.380
Rex Ryan in the jets are talking all this fucking shit and I think that it's

2073
02:07:09.661 --> 02:07:11.610
great.
Everybody's going to be looking at them.

2074
02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:15.900
I feel like the Patriots liked what the cults get every year when nobody really

2075
02:07:15.901 --> 02:07:16.830
focuses on them.

2076
02:07:16.831 --> 02:07:21.030
And everybody was looking at bill Bellacheck and who the fuck he was filming and

2077
02:07:21.031 --> 02:07:24.000
all the crap that was going on there.
Tom Brady's fucking knee.
Oh,

2078
02:07:24.001 --> 02:07:27.210
they're going to be undefeated.
It's nice that Rex Ryan,

2079
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:32.510
that insecure fat fuck is running his God damn mouth with his chronic need to be

2080
02:07:32.581 --> 02:07:36.010
liked.
Um,
I,
I cannot wait for

2081
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:41.010
<v 3>week two and I just want us to fucking killed the jets to the point that Rex</v>

2082
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:46.120
Ryan just like literally snaps that lap band in his fucking stomach.

2083
02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:50.630
Just eating Lasagna if four in the fucking morning crying.

2084
02:07:50.631 --> 02:07:54.590
I knew it wasn't good enough.
That's the podcast for this week.

2085
02:07:54.591 --> 02:07:59.390
God bless all of you.
Have a great week.
And uh,
I'll talk to you next Monday.

2086
02:07:59.391 --> 02:08:00.640
I'll let you know how the pilot chute went.

2087
02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:01.713
<v 0>Okay,</v>

2088
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:11.743
so

2089
02:08:32.690 --> 02:08:33.600
just stay with

2090
02:08:54.770 --> 02:08:55.603
us.

2091
02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.640
This will be the last thing.
